SENATE DEBATES
parts of the globe. Our world bas become so
compact, so interdependent, that all humanity
is wounded by an outbreak of violence in any
corner of the earth. Whether it be in Vietnam, Nigeria, or the Middle East, suffering in
any part of the world disturbs the whole
international community and affects Canada
as a responsible member of that community.
Although we must be aware of the effects
of these upheavals on our own country, we
are even more concerned about the damage
infiicted on the prospects for world peace and
the spread of misery and deprivation. The
means at our disposal for bringing these confiicts to -in end are necessarily limited, but
the Government is making full use of its
opportunities to help reduce international
tension.
We will continue to be an active member of
the United Nations. After a quarter of a century of radical changes in its functions and
membership, the U.N. needs to be revitalised
and strengthened. Canada is presenting its
proposals for reform to the present session of
the General Assembly.
As weapons become more destructive and
weapons' testing more dangerous, the Government is assigning a higher priority to its
efforts in the field of arms control. One barrier to a ban on underground nuclear tests has
been the difficulty of verifying that it is being
observed. As a practical step towards such a
ban, Canada has proposed an international
exchange of seismic information.
As long as differences between peoples are
permitted to degenerate into hatred and violence, we cannot remain unmoved by appeals
for help from the victims of wars. At the
International Red Cross Conference last
month, the Canadian Government gained
acceptance of a principle which it has long
supported whereby the Red Cross will be permitted to provide relief during civil wars to
civilians on both sides.
In addition to our work in international
organizations, we are intensifying our direct
contacts with many of the governments and
peoples of Latin America, Africa and Asia. At
this session you will be asked to consider a
bill to create a Canadian International Development Research Centre which will bring
together Canadian and foreign experts on the
problems of developing economies.
A disturbing element in many countries of
the world bas been the rising tide of unrest,
particularly among young people. It has
expressed itself in many ways, in public

October 23, 1969

debate, in peaceful protest and sometimes in
violence. Our profound disapproval of the
excesses must not blind us to deeply felt and
legitimate aspirations. Many citizens in our
own country believe that they are enti led to
assume greater responsibility for the destiny
of our society. Such demands, insofar as they
do not conflict with the general welfare, are
the expression of a truly democra'ic ideal.
They must be satisfied if our society is to
attain its goals of peace and justice.
The Government believes that the time has
come to extend the franchise in federal elections and it will therefore recommend to the
Standing Committee on Privileges and Elections of the House of Commons that the voting age be lowered to eighteen.
Changes will be proposed in the legislation
governing the Northern Territories which will
improve the representational character of
their Councils.
If the rights and interests of individuals
and groups are to be safeguarded, they must
be accurately reflected in the political structure of this country and in its basic blueprint,
the Constitution.
The Government therefore attaches the
greatest importance to the revision of the
Constitution and to the progress achieved by
the Constitutional Conference. The last meeting of the Conference provided an opportunity for particularly productive discussions, and
the Government is determined to spare no
effort to ensure the success of this vital task.
History, geography and economics have
placed certain of our citizens at a disadvantage. Under legislation enacted during the last
session of Parliament, the Government is
establishing programs to reduce these
inequalities.
The Official Languages Act, which provides
for the use of French and English in federal
government institutions wherever the composition of the population justifies it, will permit the exercise of essen ial language rights
within a society which recognizes and welcomes a rich diversity of race, religion and
cultural traditions.
This resolve to achieve linguistic equality
will have its counterpart in social and economic life. During the last session, Parliament
enacted legislation which will enable the
Government, with the co-operation of the
provinces, to set up programs to reduce
regional disparities in employment opportunities and average incomes. In fact, despite

October 23, 1969

SENATE DEBATES

the general cutback in its expenditures, the
Government, recognizing the overriding
urgency of these programs, has decided to
allocate an increasing proportion of its revenues to them.
The necessity for raising the level of
employment of Canadians of Indian descent
and other less-favoured citizens will also
receive special attention.
Changes in the patterns of need in our
society call for a more equitable social policy
which will offer assistance and security to
people unable to work or to provide for themselves and their families. A white paper on
social security will be presented together with
a proposal concerning the reorganization of
the unemployment insurance program.
Satisfactory relations between labour and
management are of critical importance to our
social and economic progress. The Government is devoting greater attention to the
problems and possibilities of industrial relations and will be putting forward for your
consideration amendments to the legislation
governing collective bargaining in the industries within federal jurisdiction.
There are many obstacles to be overcome
if we are to achieve our economic goals,
but inflation is undoubtedly the most serious
and the most difficult to control. If we fail
to control it, the consequences could rapidly
prove disastrous, especially-but not onlyfor those whose incomes are already low.
In recent months the Government has
urged both the public and the private sectors
to adopt special measures to combat the
dangers of inflation. These measures, which
the Government bas itself adopted, must be
applied by all if further restraints are to
be avoided.
You will also be called upon to study
proposals for tax reform aimed at a fairer
distribution of the tax burden combined
with favourable conditions for growth in
the national economy. The structure of our
tax system must be adapted to reflect more
accurately the true circumstances of individual
Canadians and of business organizations in
our modern society.
One of Canada's most valuable assets is
undeniably the richness and variety of her
material resources. In some cases, production
has increased substantially and outstripped
demand; grain is one of the commodities of
which reserves have piled up, causing financial hardship to a good many farmers.
21498-14

Increasing production of grain in many
countries has contributed to a decline in our
international grain trade and in world grain
prices. This reduction of markets and prices
has been of utmost concern to the Government, which intends to continue its search for
new outlets for Canadian grain and its efforts
to improve international co-operation and to
re-establish orderly marketing. In addition,
you will be asked to consider amendments to
the Canada Grain Act which are intended to
make our products more competitive in world
markets.
The competitive position of Canadian fisheries must also be strengthened, not only
through new licensing and marketing
arrangements, but also by extending Canada's
exclusive fishing zones.
Our resources are immense, but they are
not inexhaustible. Although we must encourage their development, we must also conserve
them and regulate their use. Water is among
.the most precious of these resources. The evidence of past failure to rehabilitate our water
resources is there for. all to see-befouled
water, despoiled beaches, rotting marine
vegetation, and diminished fishing. The Government has made known its views on this
serious problem, and bas begun urgent discussions with the provinces. Upon their completion, the Government will introduce legislation which will enable it, in co-operation
with the provinces, to improve and preserve
our water resources. Thus may we assure
ourselves of their continuing benefit for our
own domestic use, industrial expansion, and
recreation.
While the Atlantic and the Pacific retain
their traditional importance for Canada, the
Arctic Ocean and its coastal regions may soon
enter a period of rapid economic development. Much of this development will
undoubtedly occur on the islands of the
Canadian archipelago, or in the adjoining
continental shelf whose resources, under
international law, we have the exclusive right
to explore and exploit. With resource development, and the benefits it entails, may come
grave danger to the balance of plant and
animal life on land and in the sea, which is
particularly precarious in the harsh polar
regions. While encouraging such development,
we must fulfil our responsibility to preserve
these areas, as yet undespoiled and essentially
in a state of nature. The Government will
introduce legislation setting out the measures
necessary to prevent pollution in the Arctie

SENATE DEBATES
Seas. It is also considering other methods of
protecting Canada's ocean coasts.
Through the United Nations and its agencies Canada is seeking to establish a system
to combat the pollution of international
waters which threatens so many forms of life
on this planet.
Our aim is a strong and productive country
soundly equipped to face the future; but we
are equally concerned with the individual
Canadian, his rights and his interests. The
Government regards national progress and
individual fulfilment as indivisible components of its mandate.
The size, complexity and fallibility of the
structures that technology imposes on modern
societies are often in conflict with the protection and development of individual values.
The workings of both private and public
institutions may endanger the individual's
free expression of his unique personality. He
must therefore be protected from anything
that jeopardizes his rights or limits his personal development.
To this end, Criminal Code amendments
will be submitted to you that would regulate
wire-tapping and other invasions of the
individual's privacy, and reform the present
law governing detention before trial. Bills
will be submitted to make federal tribunals
more accessible and responsive, and to ensure
fair treatment in expropriation cases. There
will also be a bill to create a national law
reform commission, whose task will be the
improvement and modernization of the law
and its administration at the federal level.
You will also be asked to review the large
body of legislation applying to companies and
financial institutions. To enhance the position
of the consumer in the market place, the
Government will ask you to augment our
body of consumer protection law. There will
be proposals dealing with consumer credit,
packaging and labelling, identification of the
fibre content of textile products and motor
vehicle safety.
In the field of housing, despite the difficulties of inflation, the objective is to construet
one million new housing units in five years.
The Government will play its part in achieving that objective while emphasizing meastires to satisfy the needs of low income families. This and related programs will stimulate
social progress, employment, economic growth
and urban improvement. They are a recognition of the need for every citizen to live in
healthy and pleasant surroundings.

October 23, 1969

I have mentioned some of the important
subjects of legislation which you will be
asked to consider at this session. You will also
be invited to discuss a number of aspects of
long-range national policy.
In addition to solving her immediate problems, Canada must be prepared to face the
coming challenges of the post industrial era.
This calls for a systematic appraisal of
Canadian society and of the basic principles
that are to guide it. During the past twelve
months, the Government has begun this
lengthy task. During this session a number of
reports and white papers will be presented as
part of a comprehensive revision of Government policy. You will thus be invited to
examine the Government's findings concerning external affairs, defence, tax reform, citizenship, social security, information, and
postal service.
In these documents the Government will
define its goals and the means by which it
proposes to achieve them, but it believes
there is also a need for informed public discussion before bills are drafted in their final
form, and before any far-reaching measures
are taken.
A more intensive consideration of national
policies by Parliament is in keeping with the
spirit of the recent reforms in the rules of the
House of Commons. These new rules will
demonstrate that Parliamentary traditions
can adapt to the changed circumstances of
contemporary life while continuing to respect
of popular
fundamental principles
the
representation.
They are evidence of our common desire to
modernize our institutions so that they will
satisfy the needs and aspirations of our citizens, and thus enable us to work together in
harmony and with renewed energy to ensure
the progress and greatness of Canada.
Members of the House of Commons:
During this session, you will be asked to

expenditures authorized by Parliament.

LIBRARY 0F PARLIAMENT
REPORT OP LIBRARIAN TABLED

The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, I have the honour to present to the

Hon. David A. Croll: Before commencing
the business of the Senate this afternoon, I
should like to raise a question of personal
privilege, but one which actually concerns
every member of the house. Last evening
when the Chief Justice of Canada delivered
the Prorogation Speech we did not have any
interpretation for two-thirds of his speech.
Today there was no interpretation at ail when
the Governor General read the Speech froin
the Throne.
I took this matter up with the Clerk yesterday, the day before and at various times last
year. These facilities are provided in the
House of Commons and are available to us.'
This morning there was no sitting of the
House of Commons because the mem1bers
were ail here, yet there were no fadilities
avallable to us In this chamber.
I do not raise the matter in any critical
way, but I think the Senate should give a
direction. We have the equipment, and we
ought to use it, particularly when we ask
others to participate in both languages. We
may have very much more need for it. For
example, one of the speakers this afternoon, I
understand, will be speaking mostly in
French. It is not fair to him or to us that
there should be no interpretation. In any
event, the equipment is here and we ought ta
make sure that the interpreters are available.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, perhaps I can reply to the honourable
Senator Croll's question of privilege. On
many occasions during the hast session 1 have
had complaints regarding the interpretation
system and facilities. I arn very happy that
this matter has been raised today, at Uic
beginning of a new session. It shows the
ineerest of honourable senators in this system
and in its usefuhness.
I was advised of the fact that interpretation
was not avaihable for the sitting yesterday and
again this morning. I assure ail honourable
senators that we will get together ail the persons in authority at the hevel of administration of the Senate ta ensure that the system
works more satisfactorihy in the future. This

SENATE DEBATES
is the least we can expect for the orderly
conduct of the work of this chamber.
Again, I thank the honourable senator for
having raised this matter at the opening of
the session.
Hon. Arthur W. Roebuck: Your Honour,
may I make a comment on this matter?
In the old days in the Senate the Speech
from the Throne was read throughout, first in
English and then in French. The result was
that those who spoke French understood the
whole speech and those who spoke English
understood the whole speech. As it is at present, we switch from one language to the
other in the course of the speech. I do not like
this method. The result is tha-t those only who
are thoroughly bilingual understand the entire
speech. Those who speak only French understand only half of the speech and those who
speak only English understand only half of it.
It is necessary to wait until Hansard is distributed to learn what has been said by the
Governor General on such an auspicious
occasion.
I do not see any advantage in this current
method of reading the speech, and I wish we
could go back to the former system of having
the speech read in its entirety, first in one
language and then in the other-I have no
preference which language comes first. In ýthat
way all of us will hear and understand the
entire speech.
Hon. Donald Cameron: Honourable senators, I rise to say that I do not agree with my
good friend Senator Roebuck, that speeches
should be read in both French and English. I
can sympathize with those honourable senators-and I am one-who do not have any
great facility in understanding spoken
French, but if the translation system is made
to work, then I think that meets the need of
Senator Roebuck and of us all. I certainly
have felt that it was a change for the better
having the reading of the speech alternate
between French and English, and I hope that
practice will continue.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: That is satisfactory if
we are sitting at our own desks where we
have the earphone, but this is the first opening of a session in my many years in this
chamber when we have sat at our desks. On a
full-dress occasion we sit in chairs along the
front of the aisle and the ladies are seated
behind us, in which case we do not have
access to the translation facilities. Therefore, I
think my objection stands.
[The Hon. the Speaker.]

October 23. 1969

Hon. Mr. Cameron: Senator Roebuck is
quite right in that respect.
THE SENATE
CHAR SERVICES-QUESTION OF PRIVILEGE
Hon. Allister Grosart: Honourable senators,
I rise also on a question of personal privilege
which may also concern all members of the
chamber.
I should like to call attention to the fact
that every day on the way to my office I pass
a door in which there is a brass plate
inscribed: "Senate Char Service". I do not
know what the authority is for this title for
these 18 gentlemen and 40 ladies who serve
us so well, but I hope that honourable senators would agree with me that it is not in
keeping with the concept we have of the services rendered by our friends.
"Char" is a very old word. Perhaps the
only thing that really commends it today is
the fact that it is a very old Irish word. But
even that, in my opinion, would not be sufficient justification for continuing its use in
these particular circumstances. Over the
years it has become associated with menial
tasks, and also relates to "chores", which
again suggests repetitious and dull work. Certainly this association has existed for at least
three or four hundred years, since Shakespeare's time.
Perhaps on a day when this Chamber has
been graced with so much of our Canadian
feminine beauty, including Her Excellency, of
course, it may not be out of place for me to
make a reference to the great Queen Cleopatra, one of the classic beauties of all time. I
am sure all honourable senators will recail
that in Shakespeare's play Antony and
Cleopatra, Act IV, Scene XV, Antony dies and
Cleopatra, struck to the heart, faints. Her
maid rouses ber to the inspiring words "Royal, Egypt, Empress!" Cleopatra, quickly recovering from ber faint, replies:
No more, but e'en a woman, and
commanded

By such poor passion as the maid that
milks
And does the meanest chares.
I suggest, honourable senators, it is an ugly
anachronism that a word with such associations should be carried forth into this chamber in this the twentieth century. I might add
that those who are involved would welcome a
change with respect to this personal affront
that I have felt when passing that brass plate
daily in coming to this chamber. It has

Oclobr 23,1969SENATE
DEBATES

October 23, 1989

occurred to me that it might be appropriate
to bring this matter to the notice of our Internai Economy Committee, to the end that the
offending plate be removed and another substituted therefor which would more appropriately describe those who serve us so well.
Perhaps the wording could be "Senate Support Staff," because I think ail honourable
sena'ors will agree that these persons effectively support the work done here.
UNITED NATIONS ORGANIZATION
TWENTY-FOURTH

ANNIVERSARY

TOMORROW

Hon. Paul Martin: Honourable senators, the
Prime Minister informed me this morning
that, in accordance with practice, he will
tomorrow in the other place make a statement on the occasion of the twenty-fourth
anniversary of the establishment of the United Nations. It has been our practioe to coinmemnorate this important event. As we will
not be sitting tomorrow, I suggest to the
Leader of the Opposition that today would be
an appropriate time for us in this chamber
to reaffirm. our faith and confidence i the
United Nations, whose anniversary is tomorrow.
As honourable senators will recail, the
Charter of the United Nations was signed in,
San Francisco, in April, 1945. In the light of
the many problems that have confronted our
world, that now seemns a long time ago. Actually, in the course of huinan affairs, it is flot
so long. The United Nations bas been in existence at least four years longer than the
League of Nations. Lîke the League of
Na'ions, it bas not been free of its problems,
vicissitudes and critîcismis.
The United Nations is truly the successor of
the League of Nations. When we think of the
League we think of the notable part played in
that collective security organization, the creature of the Treaty of Versailles, by a former
Leader of the Government in the Senate,
Senator Raoul Dandurand.
The United Nations bas undergone great
changes. It bas witbstood much legitimate and
unfair criticism. Whatever criticismns are its
due, they, of course, must be answered by
goveruments and by its Secretary General.
However, what is wrong with the United
Nations today is not so much the charter; it is
flot so much tbe organization itself. Tbat
charter is as solid, as substantial, as valid and
çts useful as ever. Wbat is wrong principally
is tbe intransigence of many of its members
who have not lived up to their obligations.

Senator O'Leary, who has spoken about this
on other occasions, may invoke a contrary
argument and an authority lin the person of
George F. Kennan. Notwithstanding that, I
reafflrmi that Canada bas every reason to be
strongly attacbed to the United Nations. I
state that the responsibility for some of its
difficulties should be attributed to tbe intransigence of some of its members rather than to
a weakness in its charter.
As a strong proponent of the United
Nations, I deplore the fact that the great
issues of our time, such as the Vietnam question, and the problems of the Middle East, are
not being resolved in the United Nations.
There are reasons for this. In the case of
Vietnam, the principal parties concerned are
not members of the organization. But it would
be folly, in my judgment, in this interdependent world, to lose faith now in the Charter of
the United Nations and in the organization.
The Canadian people, I know, support the
Canadian Goverrnment in its renewed dedication and declaration o! faith in tbis collective
security eff ort.
[Translation]
Hon. Jacques Flynn: Honourable senators, I
believe it is an excellent idea to draw attention to the aims of the United Nations by an
annual celebration such as we shaîl have
tomorrow.
0f course, if you consider only Vietnam,
the Middle East and Nigeria, il might be
enough 10 cast doubt on the efflciency of that
body whose main purpose is to promote,
maintain or restore peaceThere is no translation, bonourable senators? No. Well, I may tben speak in English.
[En glishi]
Is there no translation?
Hon. Mr. Croîl: No.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: Then, honourable senators,
I shall continue iu English.
I have just mentioned that wben we think

1Hon. Arthur W. Roebuck: Honourable senators, I have neyer attended a meeting of the,
United Nations. I have been there, but flot
when it was in session. I therefore speak with
no special authority, but I arn inclined to
agree wilh my friend Senator O'Leary, that it
i.s time we examined the whole set-up of the
United Nations. I.say this flot because I arn at
ail a critic of the U.N. as it has existed. In al
probability it has done the best it could. It
succeeded an organization that failed, and it
has at least lived for the last 25 years and
exercised some influence, although flot nearly
s0 much as it should have exercised.
I remember that when we were debating
th.is question in the other house more than 25
years ago, I criticized the set-up of the United
Nations, in which there were two classes of
members, one with very much more authority
than the other. I remember Mr. King said to
me privately that it was necessary to do that
in order to achieve the organization at ail and
fo start it working. Certain big countries are
given the right of veto over the will of ail the
rest o! the world. That is not democratic.
That is autocratic. Those vetoes have been
used very much ta the destruction of the
United Nations Organization, and have prevented it from carrying out the purpose for
which it was created.
That is one of the first matters that might
well be considered in any reorganization of
the charter or the practice under the charter.
It should be a democratic organization in
which everyone has his say and his vote. The
veto o! the big powers over ail the rest of the
members should be abolished. 1 hope that the
United Nations wiil be strengthened by the
discussions that will take place in New York.
I have for a long time belonged to an
organization whose aim is to bring about
world government. It is an ideal. It is very
impractical at the moment, but nobody knows
how practical it may become in the years
ahead. It is a good idea and I have supported

admiration and when I extend to him our
best wishes. May he pursue for a long time
the brilliant career which has had such a
good beginning.
Al of us senators, I think, should feel
grateful for the choice of such a worthy person, who presided over our sittings with a
personal charm and a dignity that never
ceased to enhance the quality of our debates.
With the first session of the Twenty-eighth
Parliament, there came a new Leader of the
Government in the Senate, the Honourable
Paul Martin. The Senate was glad to welcome,
as the Leader of the Government, a most experienced politician who is also a world-famous statesman. We extend to him our congratulations for his important contribution to
the Senate and our best wishes so that he will
pursue here, for a long time, a brilliant and
fruitful career.
I add on behalf of all honourable senators, that we appreciated the intelligent participation, the unfailing courteousness and the
understanding of the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, the honourable Senator
Jacques Flynn and of his assistant, the
honourable Senator Lionel Choquette.
Honourable senators, I will make a digression here to express our sorrow at the passing, during the last session, of excellent fellow-workers and colleagues, the lamented
Senators Édouard Joseph Thériault, who died
on December 20, 1968, Clement Augustine
O'Leary, whose death occurred on June 12,
1969 and Gunnar S. Thorvaldson, who died
on August 2, 1969. A sincere tribute has
already been paid to them in a magnificent
way in the Senate. I merely wish to stress
here their worthy contribution to Canada and
to the Senate. We greatly deplore their
absence here today.
We also regret honourable Senator Sydney
J. Smith's resignation, tendered on December
31, 1968, following a fruitful career as Speaker of the Senate; that of honourable Senator
Cyrille Vaillancourt, on January 3, 1969,
whose absence we deeply regret, as we do the
resignation of Honourable Arthur L. Beaubien, Liberal Whip in the Senate, who always
enjoyed the respect and consideration of
senators on both sides of this bouse, and the
departure, on January 5, 1969, of our congenial colleague Senator Norman A. MacKenzie.
We have a very pleasant memory of them
and our wishes for a long and fruitful life
accompany them.
Lastly, I wish to thank the Leader of the
Government for the confidence and consideration he bas shown me by inviting me to move

the Address in reply to the Speech from the
Throne.
We are now in the 103rd year of our
Confederation. We are going towards our
second centennial, in the light of the numerand
recommendations
observations,
ous
suggestions that were made. We thus satisfy
in a way the wishes expressed by a great
number of Canadians. During the first session
of the Twenty-eighth Parliament, in 1968 and
1969, the Senate was somewhat modernized
and revitalized. The Senate took over many
duties and, in addition to becoming even
more efficient, it spared the taxpayers huge
amounts of money in taxes.
For the current session, the Senate has
provided for 18 active committees, membership of which is shared among the 90 senators who sit here. In addition, the role of each
of those committees has become more important than at any time in the past. Their
recommendations, their assessments of other
recommendations have been, are and will be
invaluable to parliament and could not easily
be replaced.
Since my arrival here in July 1966, I have
witnessed great functional changes in the
Senate. The Senate is leading the way much
more than before. We also note that during
the session which has just come to a close, 40
bills were initiated here and 44 bills which
came to us from the House of Commons were
passed. However, I feel that discretion will
have to be used so that this house does not
become swamped with matters of little
importance or which will inevitably have to
be dealt with hastily. The serenity of the
Senate must be preserved for more complex
problems, for more important decisions, and
assessments of great bearing and consequence.
Although I like to follow current developments in the political history of the countries of the world, I have been unable to
discover in the other senates as many and
as frequent examples of functional changes
brought about merely by means of an evolving process, without resorting to any change
in constitution. We have now right here
something which is unique and constructive.
It provides the Canadian people with every
assurance that their rights, whether they be
individual, collective or minority rights, will
be protected, with a double safeguard for the
fairness and equity of legislative and social
measures, the tool to maintain some kind of
parliamentary stability in spite of the minority governments they sometimes elect and
which tend to multiply during certain periods.

October 23. 1969

Octabr 23.1969SENATE
DEBATES

The Speech from the Throne emphasizes, in
my opinion, two main points which are of
paramount importance for Canada: inflation
and national unity.
The Prime Minister of Canada had already
warned us ail of the urgent necesslty of curtailing expenditures if we want to prevent
inflation from spiralling up. Let us remember
how much hie stressed the cutting of governmental expenses in every department and for
every project on the board.
Later on, the Prime Minister addressed
direc.ly every Canadian. He spoke of the
main problem of th.e moment; the danger of
an inflation spiral getting out of control, and
he announced the decisions his Government
was making to flght it.
In the Speech from the Throne his invita.tion to the public and private sectors is
stressed and we are somehow warned that we
have to realize how serlous the circumstances
are if further restrictions are to be avoided.
The Prime Minister should be congratulated for having wisely considered this problem
by implementing drastic recommendations to
prevent disastrous inflation. As the head of
the federal Government, he wants to give the
exemple to ail Canadians, to provincial and
municipal governments, and his stand is
a]ready bearing fruits.
It seems appropriate. ta recail part of the
Prime Minister's statement of August 13,
1969. He s ated that everybody was talking
about inflation and that additional measures
to flght it had been taken during the year. He
said:
Throughout the country, be it at the
administration levels, in business circles
or workers groups, everyone is aware
that when inflation is not curbed it
becomes a threat to each cf us.
We also know that certain sectors of the
population are particularly vuinerable:
pensioners,
non-unionized
workers,
unemployed persons, welfare recipients,
ahl these groups of citizens are worried
by the slightest increase in the general
price level. As it happens, these people
are those who have the lowest incomes.
Ail this shows the tremendous impact of
inflation on our policy for fair income
distribution.

in June last year is ta study federal
expenditures incurred during the past
decade. Fromn 1960 to this year total federal outlays nearly doubled, f rom. $6 billion ta $11 billion.
Even if we take price increases into
account-indiation strikes the state as
well-the rapid increase in expendituxes
for somne activities of the public sector
remains astonishing: the amounts allocated for general government services have
more than doubled since 1960; the
amounts voted for economic expansion
have tripled; expenditures for health and
welf are programs have almost doubled;
the federal Government's share of the cost
of higher eduýcation is sîxteen times as
great as it was in 1960.
And, further on, hie added:
From now until 1975, the amounts ailocated only to those general services that
now exist will increase by 50 per cent
approximately; expenditures for External
Affairs would double within 5 years; the
amounts spent for economic expansion
whll more than double; while those for
health and welfare programs would rise
from $2.4 billion ta $4.3 billion. The federal share of expenditures for higher
education would be four times as great;
total federal expenditures would reach
close to, $17.5 billion in 1974-75; on the
other hand, federal government revenue
would amount ta $15.75 billion.
Therefore, the deflcit for that year
would total $1,750 million. There would
also, be a cumulative deflcit of $7.5 billion
for the next flve years. I must add that
those forecasts are based on today's dollar, that is the 1969 dollar, and do not
take into account the increases ta which
contînued inflation would give rise. Ii
must be remembered also that the abovementioned figures apply only ta the prograins already in existence. Any new program, whether with regard to pollution
or to regionial development, would result
in higher levels of expenditures than
those I have mentioned.

The Prime Minister cautiously wondered
aloud about the possibilities of governmient

the administrative services, but also of flghting inflation by putting a "ceiling" on government expenses.
On the other hand, it was decided that
programns for regional economic expansion
would receive funds, that the various branches of social programns for our needy citizens
would be extended, that investments in support of education would be increased, while
severe budgetary curbs were imposed in some
areas such as transport, communications and
government services in general.
At the end of his statement, the Prime
Minister said:
I appeal in particular to the businessmnen, the trade union members, those in
public office, in short, ail those who may
exert a deep influence on the future of
the economy.
I hope to have shown that we are doing
our part, and I expect that thýey in turn
will do theirs. I cannot imagine a better
way, in the long run, to ensure the economic and social health of our country.
The Prime Minister of Canada has shown
deep insight in the analysis of a most coinplex problem; hie deserves our sympathetic
regard for formulating very courageously a
series of policies which are already proving
fruitful. To flght inflation when some areas
are abnormally hit by unemployment is flot
an easy proposition; there always looms the
danger that a concerted trend, thus started,
will acquire later on too much momentum in
the opposite direction. It wîll therefore also be
necessary to review periodically the progress
made and if need be amend, again with as
much courage, the current policies, in order
not to allow an increase in unemployment,
which tends to become chronic in some areas.
Moreover, it seems possible, in the light of
recent events, that this will become necessary
in the near future. It must be admitted
that it is in the economic field, where men
clash daily and where civilizations are put to
test, that mankind will realize that the confilect can only be settled if people become
aware of the endless and ever-widening
necessity of a moral constraint.
This is probably what has seemingly
prompted the fears shown in the Sixth Annual
Report of the Economic Council of Canada.
Shortly after bis explanations, the Prime
Minister addressed himself on that subi ect
directly to the Canadians and clearly and
simply explained the dangers of inflation and
the disastrous effects it would have in

Canada. Some people then voiced the wish ta
see and hear periodically the Prime Minister
of Canada on television and radio, where hie
would set forth the problems of the country
and outiine possible solutions. 1 quite agree
and I do hope that we will soon have in
Canada regular fireside chats given by the
Prime Minister on any current political and
economic Canadian topic.
During the recovery period of the last great
depression, President Roosevelt had been
adm-irably effective with his own "Fireside
Chats" which were an instant success and
which helped to restore confidence in the
future, to allay people's secret fears and to
stimulate new and courageous efforts of the
nation at large.
The Prime Minister's present determination
allows us to expect that, in due time, hie
will be able to ensure the graduai slackening
of imposed restrictions and limitations in such
a way as not to create greater problems,
namely, increased unemployment and deflation that could even lead to depression.
In the field of housing, the Throne Speech
states the following:
... despite the difficulties of inflation, the
objective is to construct one million housling
units in five years.
This economic and social measure is most
important for Canada. Besides providing lowcost houses for one million families of workers who will become owners, it will give jobs
to a considerable number of workers in the
construction field. It will also improve the
employment situation in the building materiacross the country. This
ais industry
humanitarian measure is most welcome
because it was difficult to get the needed
funds at reasonable rates. It will also contribute to the improvement of urban areas.
The Speech from the Throne refers to fiscal
reforms. The lack of details makes it difficuit
to see what their extent will be. Therefore, I
think we will have to wait for the bill to
make appropriate comments.
The Throne Speech reminds us of the benefits derived from national unity, while reflecting an intense desire to build a strong and
productive country, soundly equipped to face
the future. This speech also states the Government's intention to defend every Canadian's
rights and interests, and the Government's
concern about the progress and development
of the individual as two inseparable aspects
of its mandate.
Many people have seen in it a message of
hope, which heralds a concentrated effort

October 23, 1869

Ociobr 23,1969SENATE
DEBATES

towards national unity in this immense country of ours, made Up 0f numerous minority
groups.
This vital issue, of serious consequence for
our Canadians, deserves 10 be brought up
again before the Senate for a thorough
examination.
As for the unrest among young people, the
protes t and the violence that have become
part of the scene, it can be said I think that
in Canada ail reasonable Canadians disapprove the excesses 10 which such things lead.
For many months, the government circlesfederal, provincial and municipal-have been
discussing unofficially increased violence and
vindicative group demonstrations in certain
areas of this country.
As a matter of course, responsibility for
the disorders, and in most cases for their due
se'*tlement, is being ascribed to the federal
Government. Some people blame the so-called
culprits, but provide no proof or evidence
whatsoever.
First of ail, 1 should mention that these
things are not purely regional, provincial or
even Canadian, but rather international and
even universal.
We could draw Up a long list of countries
where the situation is more serious than in
Canada for in our country such instances
have so far been sporadic. This naturally does
not ailow us to renounce our duties or slacken
our efforts to check the acts of violence occurring ail over Canada.
[En glish]
Canada must nevertheless combat extremism. Rejection of any f orm of discipline will
not build or extend this nation. It wouid be a
poor foundation on the quicksand of bad
ideoiogy. Yet, Canada has been paying for
some of this nonsense a handsome public
grant of a few millions a year. If ever the
words "priority of projects" are used, let any
organiza'tion's or any company's achievement
in Montreal or in the Province of Quebec or
in some of the other provinces or chties be the
guide of our governents in their behaviour
and in their generosity.
[Translation]
Another step is also about to be taken to
bring the main elements of Canadian life
dcoser together. The Government is expected
to initiate programs intended to abolish disparities which, in the past, have been responsibie for frictions and injustice.
The legisiation passed during the last Parliaxnent, which provides for the use of IFreneh

and Engiish in the agencies and departments
of the Government, in spite of the difficulties
it might cause, will have historic effects and a
significant impact on our country. This is a
legisiation of emancipation and justice for
Canadians which gives Canada a new
dimension.
The Speech from. the Throne implements the
recent interventions made by the honourabie
sena.ors John Nichol and Charles McEiman
who so properly emphasized the dangers of
pollution in our natural environmient and the
very serious consequences which couid arise
from that situation for our people. The Senate
is the right place for a thorough study of this
current and major problem.
It is most urgent for the Government to
take a stand to prevent the overaîl contamination of water and air in popuiated areas.
Pollution is a matter which concerns everyone; individuals, companies, municipalities,
and the provincial and federal governments.
It is, besides, an international question
since our people inhabit a narrow track of
land along the boundary between the United
States and Canada and we can just as weii
become affected by the pollution from the
American territories-especially from the territory immediately confined to the Canadian
boundaries-as we can affect the American
territory bordering Canada.
The Government will therefore propose
several legisiative measures that are essential
to prevent pollution in the Arctic seas and
wiii estabiish also the means necessary to
protect the other maritime coasts of Canada.
Besides, it asserts to this effect that it will
attempt to obtain, at the international level, a
service of protection of the oceans against the
pollution which, on this planet, threatens so
many formns of life.
Despite his intelligence, man is perhaps aiso
in the process of contaminating fruits and
vegetables with pesticides and meat as weii
by injecting chemical products in order to
make it commercially more acceptabie-this
becomes a. generail practice-but also, as we
hear, so much more harmful.
The idea of making an inquiry and
senatorial investigations in thls field seems to
have reai value in view of the possible
preparation of federal legisiation and in order
to stimulate federal-provincial meetings and
international agreements towards an efficient,
control of pollution.
1This is for us, I think, a prime responsibîlity.

SENATE DEBATES
If federal legislation is ta be applied in
the whole of Canada, there will be much to
do at the provincial, municipal and industrial
levels, and even in the United States. This
will probably take a few years, in spite of all
the wishes that action be taken without delay
and in spi e of the justified fears of the evil
consequences if nothing is done immediately.
The federal support is timely and should
now be welcomed everywhere.
I am of the opinion that this legislative
measure on pollution should be formulated
with a view to setting up general principles
in consultation with the provinces and other
interests concerned.
To my mind, federal financing could be
limited Io such aid as can not yet be provided
for by direct sources, to provide for the most
pressing works in which our Government is
implicated. In existing industrial plants,
expendi ures towards controlling pollution
could be allowed as ordinary expenses instead
of having them capitalized. That being provided, it seems to me the other activities in
that field, however attractive they may be for
Ot'awa, are after all the responsibility and
privilege of provincial governments, of
municipalities and industries, for any regional
action in line with the established national
objectives.
Recently, Mr. Pearson, our former prime
minister, made a stirring appeal to prosperous
countries and to Canada in favour of countries in need of assistance. We have indeed the
feeling that our Canadian Government has a
special responsibility and that we will have
to respond to such an appeal by making a
careful assessment of foreign needs in comparison with the difficulties encountered here
in Canada.
The financial situation of all Canadian governments, especially that of provincial and
the tremendous
municipal governmen's;
increase of deficits and debts; the already
t
belated requiremen s of such heavy appropriations to implement some an'i-pollu'ion
measures, for instance; the number of underdeveloped areas in Canada and the fact that
Canada has still to solve the problem of its 4
million destitute citizens-all these considerations could restrict, from a practical point of
view, the reaction our Government would like
to crea'e.
There is moreover the extent to which
some Canadian industries, such as the textile
industry, may have to face competitive products, based on a scale entirely different from
that of production costs. The Pearson Report
is valuable in that it submits the requests
made outside Canada so clearly and urgently
[Hon. Mr. Desruisseaux.]

October 23, 1969

that it may result in a substantial increase of
better co-ordinated foreign assistance. Its
objectives, even though possibly not all fulfilled, will remain objectives that we shall
have to preserve.
One could not but expect that Canada
would someday have its ambassador to the
Vatican. According to the columnists, a number of changes are responsible for the
appointment of a Canadian ambassador at
this time. We welcome the fact that consideration of the various religions as a basis for
political divisions is rapidly disappearing in
Canada. The emphasis itself has changed and
is now directed towards a more ecumenic
spirit and a better understanding of the values and beliefs we have in common.
Concurrently, it is felt more and more that,
in the uneasy world of today, multiple
diplomatic contacts seem to be the best thing
for everybody concerned.
Once again, Canada is taking a step forward in world diplomacy. In the age of fast
communications, Canada has repealed as outdated and unimaginative the old practice of
refusing to have relations with those who are
not understood and of isolating them.
The Vatican has now been recognized as a
state for over 40 years. It has gained its territorial independence and has now diplomatic
relations with 69 countries.
Indeed, the Canadian government would
have put itself in a rather strange position
had it actively sought an exchange of ambassadors with Communist China whi.e refusing
such an exchange with the Vatican.
One should not underestimate the possible
benefits which may result from this exchange
of ambassadors with the Vatican.
As one commentator reported, the value of
diplomatic relations is something which grows
with the years, in situations which are
unpredictable at this time, and which can
emerge in a troubled world. So, the Vatican,
with its ramifications and its world-wide relations, its long experience, and its concern for
anything of universal and human significance,
has obviously much to offer in the way of
diplomatic relations at the highest and most
direct level.
In a rapidly shrinking and increasingly
complex world, Canada, through its Prime
Minister, has acted wisely and in the best
interests of the country in deciding to create
an increasing number of diplomatic posts,
and especially that at the Vatican, which
always has free access everywhere in difficult
times.

October 23, 1968

Octabr 23.1968SENATE
DEBATES

1 would like to dwell on another important
project of the Government. The review of the
Canadian Constitution.
The report contained in the Speech from
the Throne points out the progress made at
the conference on the Constitution. The last
meeting has already given rise to fruitful
exchanges. So much the better for Canada. It
is to be hoped that the overlapping of jurisdictions between the federal and provincial
governents will disappear as much as possible. That is where most of the difficulties crop
Up, but the task of establishing a new allocation of jurisdictions is stili the one which wiil
require the utmost diplomatie skill.
We were glad to have it confirmed that no
effort would be spared to ensure the success
of the Constitutional Conference.
With respect to labour-management relationships, satisfactory relations between labour and
management are of critical. importance to our
social and economic progress. It is a good
thing that government will take a growing
interest in the intricate problems of today.
It has beccme quit e urgent to tackle the
matter of the disputes that increase by leaps
and bounds between labour and management.
Realizing that nowhere in the world is
there a magic formula and although it cannot
on i s own push through broad legisiations
applying to the whole of Canada the Government will study the report from the task
force on, labour relations which will be used if
necessary as a base to the bll to be tabled
next session.
The problem of liquidating Canada's surplus of wheat will receive special consideration. More aggressiveness will be shown in
finding out new openings. The Canada Grain
Act will be amended and ex' ended so that we
may have access to a greater number of markets and that our products may be more competitive in world markets.
During the new session we will be asked to
amend the Criminal Code again. This session
Criminal Code amendments will be submitted
to you that would regulate wire-tapping and
other invasions of the individual's privacy,
and reform the present law governing detention before trial.
Those amendments wiil help ensure the
respect of individual freedom.
Other remarks might be made concerning
those
proposed
amendments
on
other
occasions.
Honourable Senator Argue has informed
the Senate of his intention to, advocate the

granling of franchise to, those of 18 years of
age. This is one of the important matters to
be found i the Speech from the Throne.
Senator Argue will want no doubt to brlng
Up this matter again. I shaîl therefore refrain
from making any comments for the time
being.
Other bills will be introduced, such as an
act to establish a corporation for the marketing of freshwater fish, in order to assist the
western fishing industry, measures to further
help the fishing industry on the Atlantic
coast, to create a new department of communicalions with a view to consolidating the
responsibility of the Government of Canada in
this field, and several others that I might add.
[English]
It xviii be an eventful session, and it may be
saîd with certainty that Parliament, and in
particular the Senate, will accomplish much
for the good and the advancement of the
Canadian people during the second session.
I am grateful for the courtesy of ail senators for bearing with me during this lengthy
address in French.
Hon. Douglas D. Everett: Honourable senators, in rising to second the motion for an
Address in reply to the Speech fromn the
Throne, I should like to refer briefly to a
speech that I made in a similar debate in the
last session. I said at that time that the Government had laid the legislative groundwork
for the just society. I think the evidence of
the last session is that that groundwork was
well laid, and that thi3 Speech from the
Throne announces a legisiative program, that
will bring atout the just society for which
this Governmcnt received a mandate. Not only
has the Government laid before Parliament
and the people it3 legislative program, it has
disclosed or proposes to disclose its thinking
and future plans in many aspects of the public undertaking. In a f orm of participatory
democracy it proposes to produce for parliamentary and public consideration white
papers on external affairs, defence, tax
reform, citizenship, social security, information, and postal service.
Honourable senators, I congratulate the
mover of the motion, Senator Desruisseaux,
who whenever he speaks demonstrates the
brilliance that he brings to the Parliament of
Canada, and especially to this chamber, on
the fullness of his coverage.
Honourable senators, i an effort to avoid
redundancy, I propose to deal with only one
aspect of the Speech from the Throne, but
onie that 1 think will demonstrate the fact that

SENATE DEBATES
this is a government of concern, and a government that is determined to bring us a just
society. I refer specifically to the Government's concern with regional disparities in
Canada. I think I can illuminate that best by
dealing with one specific region, the one I
know best, the Prairie Provinces of Canada.
What is the position of the Prairie Provinces? We are great natural resource producers. By selling that production in foreign
markets we produce foreign exchange-the
life-blood of any independent country-to an
extent out of proportion to our population.
We suffer as a result of that because the
prices we receive for our natural resources
are subject to world competition. We have a
very limited manufacturing industry in the
Prairie Provinces, but in buying the manufactured goods that we consume we are subject
to a national tariff policy which protects
industries mostly located in central Canada.
In short, we sell our production in a competitive market, but we buy our manufactured
necessities from a protected market.
In addition to that problem, we lack
numerical representation in the elected side
of the federal Parliament. Out of 265 seats in
the other place, the Prairie Provinces only
have 45. This does not give us a sufficient
bloc of votes, although I hope we have a
voice. We also suffer from something that I
would like to call corporate disappearancethe tendency of the head offices and controlling agencies of corporations to be attracted
by the magnet of Toronto and Montreal, and
to move away from the Prairie Provinces.
That, I think, is a fair assessment of the
position of the Prairies. When you hear this
you may wonder if we are doing so well in
the Canadian Confederation. What would happen to western Canada if it separated from
the rest of Canada? Immediately it would
enjoy a very heavy balance of payments surplus. The foreign exchange earnings, which
guarantee a separate country's independence,
would be enormous. We could have our own
tariff policy, and through that tariff policy we
could probably build a fairly healthy secondary industry; but if we chose not to do that,
at least we would be able to buy our manufactured requirements at competitive world
prices instead of at protected prices.
I think we could impede this corporate
disappearance of which we speak if we were
a sovereign state. I think many corporations
would find it wise to have head offices within
the western Canadian region. We would not
have to vie with the representation of 45
[Hon. Mr. Everett.]

October 23, 1969

elected representatives out of 265, to have
regional development. We might come out
very well, but I say this to you, that is not the
feeling in the Prairie Provinces. There is no
desire in those provinces to leave Confederation. Rather, the desire is to make a contribution to Confederation. If people tell you that
the Prairie Provinces have the wherewithal to
leave and are so alienated that they are about
to leave, then I suggest to you that you should
not believe it.
There is an historical dissatisfaction which
probably goes back to the time when those
provinces entered Confederation, or even
before that. That historical dissatisfaction is
exacerbated from time to time by various
events. It is exacerbated right now by the fact
that we are experiencing grave difficulty in
selling our grain. In the course of attempting
to achieve a bilingual society, prairie residents were not unmindful of the fact that it
appeared that intransigence was rewarded.
They thought that maybe they should be
intransigent and get the same rewards. I congratulate the Government on its latest initiatives, which make it clear that, while they are
prepared to be fair and just in their attitude,
they are not prepared to reward intransigence. The people of the Prairie Provinces
are concerned but they are not separatists.
They want an honest recognition of the contribution they make to Confederation, and an
honest concern with their problems.
Honourable senators, I think this Speech
from the Throne indicates that this Government has a concern for each of the regions of
Canada, and it enunciates that concern in five
areas. It talks about the fact that it is going to
reduce regional disparities. It states that,
despite the fact it is reducing its overall
expenditure, it will increase the allocation of
revenues to the overcoming of regional disparities. It takes action, and direct action, to
improve the marketing of primary resources,
which are so important to regions like the
Prairies. It undertakes the revision of the
Constitution; it also undertakes a direct influence on the corporate community. It does that
in talking about the building of a million
houses in the next five years, in the White
Paper on Taxation, but more specifically in
reference to the need for corporations to act
as the Government has done to reduce inflation. It states that corporations must follow
the Government lead, or the Government will
increase the restraints. The last two items are
not directly involved with regional development, but they disclose the sort of initiative

The fourth initiative is revision of the Constitution. The Government spoke of the fact
that it is anxious to revise the Constitution.
One of the problems in Canada that makes it
difficult to have regional development is the
fact that we do not have strong regional
representation.
Hon. Mr. Martin: Honourable senators,
would you permit me to say that I have to
leave the chamber at this time. I think Senator Everett knows the circumstances. I am
sorry to miss the remainder of this very
important speech, which I think is very creditable as well to the Leader of the Opposition.
I hope you will not think me discourteous in
leaving the chamber at this time.
Hon. Mr. Evereti: Not at all. You are most
courteous in informing me of that, sir.
Honourable senators, I was at the point of
stating that we do not have good regional
representation in Canada. I would like to contrast the Congress of the United States with
the Parliament of Canada. The Parliament of
Canada is built on parliamentary responsibility. If a person goes to the elected Parliament
of Canada he is required, pretty well, to vote
under party discipline. If he wants to represent his region he probably does it better or
more effec'ively in caucus than he does in
Parliament itself. That is not the case in the
Congress of the United States. Because of the
division of powers, a man who is elected to
Congress of the United States represents his
region, and if the administration wants his
vote on national issues, it must make sure
that it is looking after the requirements of
the region that man represents. You may say
that is a bad thing, but the Americans have
enjoyed a far more pervasive regional development because of that system than we have
in Canada. If we are revising the Constitution-I read that the Senate will become an
instrument for provincial representation-and
if senators, to a certain extent, are appointed
by provinces and if the right of veto is
reduced to a right of delay, then I think that
senators might be far more able to represent
their regions and to act in accordance with
the requirements of the regions.
The fifth initiative of the Throne Speech
was direct influence on the corporate community. It seems to me that something could
be done in the area of corporate regionalization. We are seeing in Canada the concentration of the head offices of the major Canadian
corporations located in one region, essentially
[Hon. Mr. Everett.]

October 23, 1969

in two major cities. Nineteen out of 20 of
the largest Canadian corporations are concentrated in Ontario and Quebec, primarily
Toronto and Montreal. Every day companies
are moving from the Prairies to Ontario and
Quebec, primarily to Toronto. If you ask them
why, they say that they want to be where the
action is. When they move they not only
move the personnel that go with the head
office-a major insurance company employs
1,600 to 2,000 people at its head office-they
also move all the supporting services, such as
lawyers, chartered accountants, advertising
experts, public relations experts and all the
consultative experts that are required by a
major corporation. They say they can do that
because in today's communications they can
be concentrated in one city or two cities in
Canada, but remain in touch with the outlying branches. You can see this in the demise
of -the importance of the branch office in
areas like the Prairie Provinces, and I am
sure in the Maritimes. At one time, because
of the lack of communication, the regional
manager was an important fellow. He was
given a policy and he decided how that policy
was to be implemented. Today, he is controlled almost day to day, if not hour by
hour, by head office through telex, teletype,
phone and data transmission, as well as the
corporate jet.
The concentration of the head offices is now
in Toronto and Montreal. This is hurting and
is creating a tremendous drain of brain power
from areas like the Prairie Provinces. If you
keep on draining out that brain power you
are going to wreck these communities. I say
that if communication makes it possible for
head offices to concentrate in one or two cities, then why does not communication make
the antithesis possible? Why cannot the head
offices of these major corporations be spread
across Canada? If communica ion is the
answer, then surely it matters less and less
every day where they are.
I, therefore, suggest to the Government that
not only should there be incentives for the
industrialization of depressed areas, there
should also be incen'ives for the regionalization of corporate offices.
Honourable senators, I would like to congratulate the Government on the Throne
Speech, because I think it really does make
the start on the just society. I second the
motion for the adoption of the Throne
Speech.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Flynn, debate

He said: Honourable senators, the fifteenth
meeting of the Commonwealth Parliarnentary
Association was held in Port of Spain, the
capital of Trinidad and Tobago, between
October 5 and 18 of this year. The hast was
the Governrnent of Trinidad and Tobago, and
Gavernor General Sir Soloman Hochoy presided at the open.ing ceremony. He is one of
the most distingujshed men one could meet
anywhere in the Commonwealth. I will have
occasion ta refer ta him later.
As honourable senators know, the Prime
Minister is Dr. Eric Williams. He was indeed
pIeased ta have the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association meet ini this country. He
toak occasion at the opening meeting ta
inform the delegates that constitutional
changes were about ta take place in his country which would probably resuit i the establishment of a republic.
The President of the Senate, Dr. J. Hamilton Maurice, was also very much in evidence.
Senator Maurice is one 0f the great palitical
philasophers i the C.P.A., and his contribution ta the success of the meeting was
notable.
The Speaker of the House of Representatives, C.A. Thomasos, known ta many hanaurable senators, was also one of the important
persanages from Trinidad and Tobaga wha
made their presence felt. Mr. Thomasas,
familiarly known ta us ail as "Tommy", was
in Ottawa at the Speakers and Clerks Conference a few weeks prior ta the C.P.A meeting in Trinidad.
The chairman of the General Council, the
Honourable A. G. Montano, cames from
Trinidad and Tobago where he is Minister of
Home Affairs and Personnel. I cannot pay
adequate tribute ta the indefatigable work
dane by Mr. Montano on the occasion of this
meeting and throughout bis year as chairman
of the General Council of the Commonwealth
Parliamentary Association. He is a distinguished, enlightened and, I may add for the
benefit of my female coileagues, a very bandsome man. He bas the added distinction of
being married ta a Canadian, a very beautiful
and cbarming womnan. She performed in an
outstanding way during the conference in
helping with the social amenities provided for
the ladies who were in attendance.
The hospitality of the people was warmn and
deeply personal. The living accommodation
and the transportation and other arrangements were of the highest order. The meetings were held in an abandoned Aznerican

Army base which was ideally canverted to
serve the purpose. It was air conditioned, and
was equipped with an efficient sound system
and other facilities, as good as can be found
anywbere in the world.
This C.P.A. meeting was one of the most
useful I have ever attended It seemed ta me
there was more know-how, mare understanding and appreciation of the problems of the
Commonwealth among the delegates than at
any other. 1 arn sure others who attended will
be talking about many of these factors.
During the conference the executive committee of the association met several times,
and again, in my view, demanstrated its
great value ta the C.P.A. The Honourable
Peter Howson, the leader and the co-ordinator of the executive committee, could not stay
for the discussion portion of the meeting
because there was an election in Australia in
wbich bis seat was at stake, and he had to get
back ta campaign. But, while he was there,
and indeed tbrough ail this year, bie did very
effective wark on bebaîf of the executive
committee and the association.
I shauld like ta pay a very special tribute to
Sir Frederic Bennett of the United Kingdom
delegation, who is the treasurer of that
branch, and who has brought to the financial
side.0f the work of the Executive Committee
an unsurpassed understanding and knowledge
of finance, investment and handling of
moneys. I am satisfied, as I amn sure everyone
within the organization is, that the finances of
the association, which are cansiderable eacb
year, are under excellent contrai. This is a
source of assurance for everyane who has any
responsibility for the association.
On other occasions I have ailuded ta the
work of the other members of the Executive
Conimittee, and I shail not do s0 at this time.
I have already mentioned the excellent work
done by Sir Frederie Bennett, who is retiring
as treasurer. He was elected ta the unprece-,
dented office of hanorary adviser ta the
incaming treasurer. I tb.ink this meets with
the approval of the incaming treasurer; certainly the executive itself approves.
The Secretariat of the General Couneil was
very much in evidence. They had been i

their own internai, economic and social problems. We are thus developing a position, a
thrust, within C.P.A., and I think within the
Commonwealth too, which is ail to the good.
The leader of the Canadian delegation was
the Honourable John Turner. He led the discussion in the committee dealing with the
problem of youth in revoit. I can say without
any exaggeration whatsoever that he electrified that committee. The following mornîng I
was sitting in another committee, because I
wanted to do some work there. Senator Fulbright came and sat down beside me. The
members of the committee were maînly lawyers talking about some legal institutions
within the Commonwealth, and Senator Fuibright said, "This is ail very interesting and
important, but I arn going back to the Turner
committee. That's the place where the sex
appeal is." After Mr. Turner had flnished his
speech, a young student wîthin my hearing
said, "As long as that young man is alive,
John F. Kennedy will neyer die." This was
the effect he had upon a great many of the
people there. I thought that was a great tribute to a man. Mr. Turner was cailed to the
Bar of Trinidad and TIobago, a special honour
which I think was appreciated by ail of the
Canadian delegation. He was presented by
Senator George Richards, the Attorney General of the country and admitted by the Chief
Justice, Sir Arthur McShine. There were five
or six of the other justices in attendance at
the simple, but very dignifled and impressive
ceremony.
I am sure that the honourable senators who
were in attendance would feel that 1 had not
been faithful to my duty if I did not single
out Mr. James Walker for special mention. He
acted as leader of the delegation until Mr.
Turner arrived from some appointments in
Europe. I do not think there is anyone more
popular in the C.P.A. than Jimmy Walker.
We cannot thank hlm enough for the way he
managed the delegation, managed the working arrangements, managed to get the names
of delegates onto the speaking lists and
managed to inform the delegates about the
kind of performance they were expected to
come up with.
Hon. Mr. Benidickson: That is what he
used to do as Whip.
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): Yes. He
has had some pretty good training.
Honourable senators may be interested in
knowing that there were over 60 branches of

the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association
represented at this meeting. Twenty of these
delegations were led by ministers and 18 by
presiding officers. Let me just indicate some
of the ministers who were there.
The leader of the delegation from the United Kingdom was the Right Honourable
George Thomson from Dundee. The Right
Honourable Mr. Thomson was the Minister
for Commonwealth Affairs. He became Minister without Portfolio after his department
was merged with the Foreign Affairs Department. He is now back in charge of a segment
of the work that deals with Commonwealth
affairs. I know of no more civilized, no more
humane and no more pleasant person to deal
with than George Thomson.
The Australian leader was Senator McKellar, the Minister for Repatriation. The leader
from Malawi was the Minister of Health and
Community Development, the Honourable A.
M. Nyasulu. From Jamaica, we had the Minister of Youth and Community Development,
the Honourable Allan Douglas as leader.
From India we were privileged to have the
Speaker of the Lok Sabha, Shri Dhillon. I
charged hlm with being of Irish desoent, but
he said, "You only have to look at me to see
that I am not." New Zealand sent the Postmaster General, the Honourable William J.
Scott to lead the delegation.
I should put the names of the Canadian
delegation on the record. From the House of
Commons, I have already mentioned the leader, the Honourable John Turner. From the
Senate there were the Honourable Raymond
Eudes and the Honourable Rhéal Belisle. Also
from the Commons were Mr. James Walker,
Mr. Jacques Trudel, Mr. R. R. Southam and
Mr. R. Thomson. All of these federal delegates
played a very full part in the work of the
Conference, not only the speaking in the committees and the plenary sessions, but particularly in working with the delegates from
other countries, and getting their points of
view and putting the Canadian point of view
before them.
We also had representatives from the provincial branches: from Quebec, Mr. Roland
Théoret; from Nova Scotia, Mr. Michael Laffin, whose golf needs some improvement, let
me say. He was my partner on one occasion,
but we won the money. From New Brunswick
we had Honourable Robert McCready, Speaker of the Legislature; fromn British Columbia,
Mr. James Chabot; from Alberta, Honourable
Anders O. Aalborg; from. Newfoundland,

SENATE DEBATES
Honourable George W. Clarke; from Prince
Edward Island, Mr. Alban Farmer, Q.C.;
from Saskatchewan, the Minister of Welfare,
Honourable C. P. Macdonald.
The secretary to the Canadian delegation
was Mrs. Harwood, to whom we all owe a
great deal for a job well done. The secretary
to the provincial delegation was Mr. G. Lorne
Monkley of Prince Edward Island.
Mr. Alistair Fraser, the Clerk of the House
of Commons, was in attendance as an observer, and I think this was a useful exercise for
us and for him.
Honourable senators, on June 12 I put the
agenda of this Conference on the Senate
Hansard, and I need not repeat it.
The Canadian delegates spoke at most of
the sessions, both plenary and committee, and
they did very well indeed. Personally, I took
part in some of the committee work, although
at the plenary session I had some chairman's
duty to perform. I had duties to perform also
in connection with both the executive committee and the general council.
In the Committee on the Future of the
Commonwealth-where there was a most
enlightened discussion-I intervened in connection with a problem which I hoped could
be solved by some joint effort on the part of
Commonwealth governments and perhaps
urged in that direction by delegates to Commonwealth Parliamentary Association meetings. This the problem of mediation of disputes, of crises, as they develop both within
and between Commonwealth countries, I
referred to such areas as India and Pakistan,
and to Nigeria, where efforts of all kinds so
far have failed to bring the disputing parties
together.
This committee happened to be attended by
Mr. Arnold Smith, who has made noble
efforts in Nigeria. When there are disputes
within a Commonwealth country or between
two Commonwealth countries, or perhaps
between more than two, there is no reason
why the Commonwealth authorities in the
countries concerned could not look to other
Commonwealth sources for mediation.
I spoke also in that committee on another
topic, the responsibility which devolves
upon the newly independent countries. I
referred to the Canadian experience in this
respect, as it developed after the passage of
the Statute of Westminster in 1931.
There was some considerable discussion
about the establishment of a Commonwealth
[Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West).]

October 28, 1969

court. I expressed a view, which could only
be a personal one, as far as Canada is concerned. We decided many years ago, although
it took us sixty or more years to accomplish
it, that our own supreme court would be our
final court of appeal. In other words, we had
come to the point where developments within
our judicial system were such that we could
rely on our own courts to settle both public
and private disputes.
There are some countries in the Commonwealth where the development of the judiciary is not as advanced as it is in other parts. I
put this point of view to the committeeagain,. it was a personal one-that it may still
be desirable for some of the emerging developing countries to continue to use the Privy
Council as the court of last resort for their
disputes.
Another question raised was the possibility
of using a Commonwealth court for the resolution of economic and political difficulties
between countries. The personal view which I
expressed was one which seemed to commend
itself to the committee. It was that mediation
by knowledgeable people from one country
could be looked to as a method of solving
some of these problems. Court proceedings
could lead to rigidity and delay in this area.
On the committee which dealt with the
Future of Parliamentary Democracy, I talked
a bit about the relations in Canada between
the executive and the private members, the
efforts now being made here to have private
members more in communication with government and with its plans and policies. This
I know happens within the government
caucus. I also referred to the fact that certain
research facilities are being made available to
the Opposition, particularly in the other
place, so that their workload will be lessened.
Contributions along similar lines were
made by other countries represented there. In
other words, one gets the impression from
these meetings that parliament is really in an
evolving state throughout the Commonwealth.
The most important debate was probably
that on Economic Development. It dealt with
marketing, regional groupings and marketing
arrangements, the climate for foreign investment, tax incentives, and the need for political stability.
The question of aid arose. The Pearson
Report had just been released. There was considerable discussion on various parts of that
excellent work. The problems of foreign

exchange ini some developing countries are
very great. They were aired.
Generally speaking, the people who participated in this debate were concerned with
providing a better material basis i ail the
Commonwealth countries for what is generaliy described as the "«good life"-the material
basis on which an intellectual, cultural and
moral life could be established i a more
effective way.
The focus was on hard facts, on acute problems, many Sa acute as to encourage a restiveness bordering on desperation on the part
of some of the participants. I do flot exaggerate the urgency of providing help of ail kinds
in the "Third Worid." That urgency, honourable senators, is now, and it wiil continue for a
generation or perhaps more.
What is surprising is the wilingness of its
spokesmen to attack the problem. with reason,
with responsibility and with moderation.
It is impossible, of course, to review the full
spectrum. of the discussions. These may have
been summed up by His Excellency the Governor General, Sir Solomon Hochoy, at the
opening session, and taken up with serlousness and without recrimination by the delegates. I should like to quate same phrases
from what he said on that occasion:
You meet in a season which can be
described as at one and the same time
promising, perplexing and disappointing.
Promising by reason of the incredible
advances which. have been made over the
recent past years in science and technology ... There hs always the question
mark whether that better life will pervade the entire globe and will benefit al
humanity. Perhaps it might be correct ta
say that one can no longer speak of anything i absolute terms, except the transient nature of man's life on earth.

influence of considerations for material

That discrimination at ail levels can be
found and regarded as commonplace;
.. social justice, whîch hs the cornerstone

matters of deep concern ta you hs evidenced by your agenda,Hanaurable senatars, may I conclude by
saying that Trinidad is a beautiful place. By
day the sun is brilliant and hot in a clear sky.
The nights are soft. Everywhere is the great
sea with its snug inlets and its vast blue
waters. It is typically tropical, bountifully
fertile. Everywhere it is green-verdant
green. It is not a prairie. There are ranges of
mountains like Canada's Laurentians, lending
variety and beauty ta the landscape.
There is poverty in Trinidad and Tobago:
widespread poverty; but there is, I think, fia

the honourable Senators Bélisle, Carter,

He said: Honourable senators, the resolution that is being presented here today is in
the same form as the earlier resolution when
it was passed here last year, except that it
incorporates both the papers and the evidence
that accumulated in the course of our
hearings.
There is one change. There are two new
members in the committee. Senator Clement
O'Leary was a very valuable member of the
committee and was keenly interested in its
work. I sat with him on the committee on
prices as well as on this committee, and I
thought he was a very much under-estimated
man. We miss him very much in this committee and sadly regret his passing.
Senator Nichol had other commitments. He
tried to arrange his affairs so as to stay on
the committee but he could not do so. Senator
McDonald will move the appropriate motion
tomorrow for replacing these two members.
What I have to say here today is in the
form of a report. I think that you would like
to know what has been going on in the committee and what progress we have made. I
may take a little longer than I should to tell
you about these things. However, it is the
work of a session and I think that justifies
placing it before you on the record. I will
indicate to you later that our record is being
read.
The Comittee on Poverty was established
November 26, 1968. The house adjourned over
Christmas, and the committee members were
appointed on January 23, 1969. There were 18
senators, representing all of the provinces and
all shades of opinion in the Senate and in the
country.
These senators indicated that they wanted
to be on the committee. I was of the opinion
[Hon. Mr. Croll.]

October 28, 1969

that they have a deep concern and a feeling
for the poor and that they were dedicated to
the undertaking. Some might have looked
upon membership as a task, but to the committee it was a challenge. The attendance at
the committee was excellent. The questioning
was very pointed and rewarding; the members
became old hands at the "poverty question".
They knew a great deal about it from personal experience.
The Staff Director, Mr. Fred Joyce, was
seconded from the Department of Defence
and appointed to the committee in February.
Three other members of the staff were
seconded from Government departments.
Four members of the staff are from outside
the Government service.
The Ministers of the Government have
been most co-operative and understanding
and have responded to the request for staffand I think we have asked for the best. We
are now at the point where we need to augment the staff because we are going into further hearings and further calls will be made
on the Ministers. I feel that the best people
for the kind of work the committee is doing
can be found in the Government service.
If we are fortunate enough to obtain more
members of the kind that we have on the
staff at the present time, it will be to our
benefit. I might say that the totally dedicated
people we have do not seem to act like staff,
but feel that they are part of the committee.
They feel that they are participating in a
cause in which they believe-a cause they
look upon as a great adventure to which they
would like to contribute something of value.
We began our hearings on April 22 and
continued twice weekly until June 26.
I have in my hand a completely factual
document, being a résumé of the activities of
the Committee on Poverty, which sets out the
names of the organizations which were examined, the names of witnesses and where their
evidence appears. I think this will be very
useful for senators and others attending
future hearings of the committee. With the
permission of honourable senators I shall ask
that it be made part of the record and appear
as an appendix to today's proceedings.
The Hon. the Speaker: Is it agreed honourable senators?
Hon. Senators: Agreed.
(Fortext of résumé see Appendix, pp. 53-54.)

government agencies, the Canadian Welfare
Council, the Metis Associations of Alberta,
Saskatchewan, and Manitoba, in one group,
and the Company of Young Canadians. I can
perhaps best describe the general theme
recurring throughout the hearings in this
way: in order to eradicate poverty we need
conditions of a stable rate of economic
growth, high employment and stable prices.
These will flot in themselves solve the poverty problem, but they will help in finding a
solution. Secondly, there must be a major
shift in the distribution of income among
Canadians. It may well surprise you when I
say, and here I arn repeating what is to be
found in the record of the Economic Council,
that there has been no redistribution of
income in this country since 1952. To put it in
crude terni; the rich have got richer and the
poor have got poorer.
Hon.
Mr.
Connolly
(Ottawa
Relatively and absolutely?

West):

Hon. Mr. Croli: I think that is right-certainly relatively.
The guaranteed annual income was supported, and it was felt that there should be a
government agency responsible for co-ordinating and assembling anti-poverty programs and that poverty should be regarded as
a problemn in its own right. The community
development types of activity are very valuable. As I have said, this is the substance of
the evidence heard by the conimittee.
Now, permit me for a moment to deal with
our plans for the future. On Monday next the
committee will visit the Maritimes-Halifax
and Charlottetown-where we will hear from
people in the area. Then we return to Ottawa
where we have a meeting with the Economie
Council. In the week of November 16 we
travel to Winnipeg and Vancouver. After that
we plan to spend a week in the Montreal area
and a week in the Toronto area, with further
plans to visit each of the provinces as trne
permuta and arrangements can be made. I
might summarize our purpose as being to
look, to see, to hear, to meet and to try to get
the feeling of the poor and those people in
the community who are interested in the
poor.
For 1970 we have 57 firm, comrnitmnents by
national, provincial and private organizations
who wish to be heard. There are 20 organiza*tions who wish to present briefs but who may
flot have to be heard. We have to make provisions for hearing from the provinces and

municipalities and we have to cali Canadian,
Amierican and other experts and social workers. These latter will probably appear by
invitation because we may want them to
cover special areas. I think you wiil agree
with me that it looks like a very busy year.
In order to contact the poor in every province, two members of our coxnmunity liaison
staff have been across the country twice to
meet and visit with them. We think that their
involvement is essential because the poor

for them around the decision tables. And,

they must enter the in-group.

pre-packaged. solutions; they wish they had.
However, they do have views. At this stage
they are sîmply listening and questioning.
At first sight this poverty study seemed like
a frightening undertaking. Mfter the hearings
progressed it becanie merely formidable; now,
although we have barely scratched the surface, we can see some daylight. Attitudes
have changed since we began that lonely
odyssey with the committee. We are now
reaching bandwagon proportions. I think the
poor can take heart.
But, honourable senators, what are we
doing that is different? We are the first body
to view our poverty and welfare systems as
they affect the people of Canada in totality.
We identify the people who are in poverty,
not as statistics and not as a percentage of the
population but as people who bleed, people
who are ordinary human beings. We ask the
Canadian people to meet them because we are
sure they will recognize them. Some o! them.
will be neighbours, some will be friends, some
will be relatives and some will be chikiren
who play with their children. For this reason
we think they will be very much concerned.
Let me give you a clearer picture. The
welfare state was born during the depression
in the 1930's. The economic system had lost
its footing. There was a great emergency and
improvisation measures had to be taken. The
existence of unemployment on so vast a scale
and the suddenness of the impact marked the
end of an era in which social services were
designed for social delinquents. It was the
beginning of a new day in which the
resources of the community and of the nation
were made available to ail as of right. The
federal Government, began to make contributions to relief and welfare in 1930, and this in

SENATE DEBATES
turn was follawed through the years by a
great number of social measures and programs intended ta assist those in need. But
they did flot work out that way. It may well
be that we deait with the problem on the
wrong basis by having at the beginning a
means test. In my view the social measures
we have in aur country are f ar superior ta
those of almost any other country in the
western world. Yet, somehow or other, they
have nat dane the job they were intended ta
do. Let me indicate how we just missed the
boat. It took us 36 years ta get rid of the
means test, which was a mean test because it
stripped the applicant of nearly ail his worldly goods, Nis dignity as a persan, and lef t him
without reserves, to be blown off his feet by
the first ili wind, and sa hie bounced in and
out of the welf are office.
The passing of the Canada Assistance Act
in 1966 was ano'her watershed. The means
test was abandoned, and in its place the needs
test was accepted. But, this was 36 years late.
Lt was laie in the day. By this time welfareism had so regenerated and perpetuated itseif
that poverty had become the end product.
The welfare system cannot be written off as a
complete failure, far from it-just a f allure.
The poor man who entered the welfare
bureaucratie box is processed. He goes
through a needs test admnistered with a
means test implication. He is given a number.
He is given a file. He becomes a client, and
nobody likes ta lose a client. This is the
beginning of the poverty cult.
The challenge of poverty came in the Fifth
Annual Review of the Ecanomic Council of
Canada in September 1968. The Senate
accep' ed the challenge within a month, and
hearings commenced in April. We were wondering during those hearings if anybody was
interested in the proceedings, and if anybody
was paying attention ta them. The press
throughout the country gave extensive caverage ta the hearings, but TV was too busy
cavering the separatists in Quebec ta have
any time for us. National and ather organizations began inquiring if they could be heard,
and able, intelligent, and knowledgeable witnesses from the variaus departments submitted well prepared briefs for consideratian and
were subjected ta exacting questioning before
the committee. These were seriaus people gîving seriaus thought ta a seriaus prablem, and
they djd their best ta be helpful. There were

We printed a thausand copies of aur proceedings, and almast before we knew it that

of a surprise when we faund it necessary ta

Then, ail of a sudden-and these are things
that cannai be predicied-paverty came alive
as a political issue. At the highest level the
leaders of the political parties of this country
iniiated discussions, and this time it was nat

were far-reaching, imaginative, and realistic.

Sa what began as a committee dialogue

political party can drap from its top priarity

The Canadian Congress of Labour, the
Canadian Chamber of Commerce, and the
variaus churches have spent much time
recenily assessing their positions, and defending their values in the social structure of the
land. From everything we have been able ta
gaiher sa far, there are no easy solutions and
there are no cheap solulions. But, it is alsa
evideni that we can break the back of paverty without breaking the back of aur country,
ihough we may sirain it a 11111e.
Honourable senatars, in speaking of paveriy I shauld like ta define it for yau. Lt is not
easily defined, but we took some pains ta get
a knowledgeable definition. Lt seems ta be an
accepied procedure in this day and age that
before problems can be adequately solved
they must be defined. When one gels araund
ta attempting ta deal with a problem as braad
and complex as poverty, thore seem ta be as
many definitions as there are people attempting ta frame a definition.
Ln his book The Affluent Society, former
Canadian John Kenneth Galbraith said:
People are povorty-stricken when their
incarne, even if adequate for survival,
faîls radically behind that of the camrnunity. Then they cannat have what the

Miss J. R. Podoluk of the Dominion Bureau
of Statistics-she is one of their specialistshas a more easily understood definition. She
dlaims that if a family spends 70 per cent or
more of its income on food, shelter and clothing it is at or below the poverty line. Included
in this definition i 1961-and I will bring
you Up to date in a minute-would
be
individuals wîth incomes of less than $1,500;
familles of two wih incomes of less than
$2,500; familles of three with incomes of less
than $3,000; families of four with incomes of
less than $4,5 00, and familles of five or more
with incomes of ]ess than $5,000.
The Economic Council, when iA appeared
before the Committee on Poverty last spring,
accepted that definition, but it updated Miss
Podoluk's figures which were based, as I told
you, on 1961 data, and camne up with a 1968
poverty line. They simply adjusted for the
increase in prices over the seven-year span,
and established the 1968 poverty lime at
$1,800 for a single person, $3,000 for a couple,
$3,6C0 for a family of three, $5,200 for a
family of four, and $5,800 for a family of five.
What they did, roughly, was to add $300 to
the income of a single person, $500 to the
income of a family of two, $600 to the income
of a family of three, $700 to the income of a
family of fo-ur, and $800 to the income of a
family of six and more.
Professor Emîle Gosselin of the University
of Montreal used a different scale. He defined
a family of four in Montreal with an income
of less than $2,000 as living in misery, with
less than $3,000 as living in poverty, with less
than $4,000 as living in privation, and with
less than $5,000 as living only on marginal
existence.
Han. Mr. Mar±in: Does hie give the numbers
with those incomes in that city?
Hon. Mr. Croli: No, but we have themn in
aur records. It is a rough situation in Montreal. None of us on the committee wants to
leave the impression that poverty is a problem of inadequate income only. I will cover
that in a few minutes. It is much more than
that. It i3 employmnent, it is education, it is
training, it is housing and health, it is environiment and it is incentives.
In the spring and summer, very early after
we established the committee, Dr. James Cutt
of York University, who in my view is the
ablest authority in Canada on the guaranteed
income, and Dr. Philbrook, a sociologist on
aur staff, made a study i depth of the American poverty programs. This study included

the guaranteed income experiment in New
Jersey which. has been conducted by the University of Wisconsin Institute of Research on
Poverty and which is composed of 78 nationaily recognized professionals. This experiment is a three-year program involving a
thousand working poor families in Trenton,
New Jersey. Both Dr. Cutt and Dr. Philbrook
spent sonie time i Washington, where they
met and conferred with top officiais at the
Office of Economic Opportunity. I want to
express a word of thanks to our labour
attaché in Washington, Mr. Patrick Conroy,
who was instrumental in opening the Washington doors. Two reports of these visits are
now in the hands of the committee. We await
the final one, when ahl reports will be presenited to the committee at a public hearing.
Edwin R. Black, director of research for the
Conservative Party, and Marion Bryden and
Desmond Morton, who have done research on
the guaranteed income for the N.D P., will be
invited. We anticipate that they will accept,
and present their reports to the committee
about the samne time that the reports are
being presented by our own staff.
Hon. Mr. Lamontagne: What about the
Liberals?
Hon. Mr. Croli: They are practising it; our
problems, serious as they are, are not comparable to the American problems. In the 'United States they have special areas of concerni
which happily do not exist in this country. Do
not belittle what the Americans are doing.
They are applying brains, effort and vast
sunis of money to solve their problem. They
have had some successes and some failures.
Two lessons stand out from what you know
and what our reports indicate. Money alone
will not solve the problem, but let me finish
the sentence: until we finýd a substitute for
qnoney, it will be number one on the need
parade.
The second point is that the longer you put
off deallng with a problem which s0 intimately and adversely affects the well-being of a
large nuniber of human beings, the less likely
it is that you can control or solve that problem through normal remedies. If we deal
with ours in good time, as we are doing, the
probleni is soluble. If we do not and we say
that it cannot happen here, then *ve are fooling ourselves. We must learn fromn their mistakes. They waited too long; they did not

be a very large group, but their young
dependent children number 200,000 to 250,000
and we have to consider them.
The working poor are the guts of poverty
in this country. They are the unskilled, unlettered,
unorganized,
unrecognized
and
unheard. They work full time, they work part
time, they work seasonally, they work any
time, 50 weeks of the year, eight hours a day
or more, for minimum wages or less, from $1
to $1.30 an hour. They are well below the
poverty line. Many of the wives work part
time. They send the children out to work
early in life. The families live poorly, always
on a minimum existence. In every province
but one in this country the men in this group
can do better on relief than they can by
working for these wages, and yet they choose
to work. We hear much talk about their not
being willing to work. Nothing the Economic
Council can find out about it and nothing I
have heard from any authority justifies that
allegation. I tell honourable senators now that
these people are working. In three provinces
municipal labourers of more than four years
standing draw so little that their income is
below the poverty line. Work it out for yourself. It is very easy. I will not name any of
the provinces. If he works 2,000 hours and
receives $1 an hour be is not going to visit
Florida very often. In a few minutes I will
say a little more about that.
Let us deal with the hard core. As I said,
almost 5 per cent of the problem deals with
the hard core. These are not only disadvantaged people, they are deprived people. Some
of them will not work and cannot work and
some say that the country owes them a
living. They are misfits and emotionally disturbed, some below average intelligence. That
is really a toughie. I do not know what the
answer is, but there are children and families
involved. There are very often women
involved, and from what we can find when
things go rough in the home the woman bears
the greatest burden.
What are we doing about it at this
moment? In the course of our hearings
matters of concern arose that could be helpful to some of these people. For instance, we
discussed the matter of sickness insurance. It
is almost a catastrophe when a poor man who
is working for $1.25 an hour is sick for two
days or loses two days. The loss of earnings
in countries like Australia, France, Sweden
and the United Kingdom, which have good
social measures, are covered. Under sickness
insurance persons would draw from 65 to 70
21498-3

per cent of their average earnings. The same
is true for maternity benefits. The same 65
countries have that also. For two weeks they
can draw 62 per cent of their average
earnings.
When you ask questions, you do not know
what kind of answers you are going to
receive. First, I want to make sure that my
position is clear. I am of the school of Pearson
with respect to foreign aid, and I have some
witnesses here-the Speaker, who was chairman, and Senator Leonard, if he were heredo not misunderstand me. When they came
and informed me about the 65 countries, I
said, "Would you mind getting me the list?"
and they got me one. I find that of the 65
countries in the world that have what they
call sickness and maternity programs, 23 of
them receive foreign aid from Canada. I do
suppose that these people who need bricks
and mortar to build up their country, have a
high regard for the individual and his needs.
We might well give serious consideration to
sickness and maternity insurance.
We heard evidence on taxation-I am not
covering this subject, but merely calling it to
your attention. Anyone who has taken the
trouble to read the Carter Report will note
that he said the poor people pay proportionately more than their share, and he
proves it by tables. The Sixth Review of the
Economic Council says this:
The majority of the poor contribute
more to general tax revenues than they
receive in the form of government welfare expenditures.
These poor are complaining that the system
keeps them poor. You know, they have got
something, because they have really been
neglected. The man who draws $4,200 and
who has four children, we say is within the
poverty line. He pays taxes of $220 in addition to the indirect taxes. Any man who earns
less than $5,000 a year, according to the
Carter Report, pays a disproportionate amount
of total taxes.
I am not going to say much about minimum
wages, except that minimum wages are poverty wages, and a great number of people
work below them. The women's minimum
wages are almost shameful. Sometimes you
wonder why I speak so glowingly and favourably about unions. The unions walk the picket line in order to avoid the poverty line. You

hardship resulting from temporary loss of
earnings.
I arn delighted when I read the report of
the interview of the minister who says that
they intend to raise the unemployment benefits and extend the time of benefits as well as
the coverage, and to trans fer the systemn to a
more broadly based income maintenance program. Those are not my words. Those are the
words of the minister, and they really raise
one's hopes. This could mean that there will
be a new tax on the rich for the benefit of the
poor. I have already told you there has
been no redistribution since 1952; maybe we
will now have some sort of redistribution.
Here we are with a plague, the plague of
poverty, and we have ail got to get into it and
fight it untîl we win. We have to establish an
income floor for the working poor. It has to
be done, and you. can see what it can lead to.
I think it will lead to a self-funding scheme

just this: administration is the great problemn
bothering us. What we need is a scheme that
is an easily understood administrative system
that must be national in scope, with maintenance fromn the federal Govermnent and services from the provincial governinents. At
least that is our thinking at the present time.

beyond me. They do not know how these

of money, but that is not the way we do
things in this country, as 1 have indicated. We

Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, ta
adopt the motion?
Hon. A. Hamiton McDonald: Honourable
senators, I should point out ta the house that
this morning a meeting was called of the
chairmen of special and standing committees
in an attempt ta discuss some of the problems
we ran into regarding committee meetings
during the previaus session.
The sitting ai committees while the Senate
is in session was one question which was
discussed. I would like ta refer ta that paragraph af honourable Senatar Croll's motion
which deals with the comrnittee on poverty
sitting "1during sittings and adjourruments ai
the Senate". In my opinion, two interpretations can be placed on the wording "1ta sit
during sittings and adjournments af the
Senate."
Some people argue that ta sit "during sittings" means that the committee may sit an a
day when the Senate sits but does flot; mean
that it may sit while this chamber is in session. Others argue that the meaning af the
phrase "Ita sit during sittings" means that a
cammittee may sit while the chamber is actually in session. This has led in the past ta
some argument and some confusion.
Hawever, this marning at the meeting held
with the chairmen ai standing and special
cammittees, a proposai was made which states
as foilows-and I wiil read fram the notes
which were taken during that meeting:
That Senate committees, standing and
special, be not; given a blanket power in
their ternis ai reference to sit while the
Senate is sitting, with the understanding
that exemptions can be negotiated ta
accommadate exceptianal circumstances
when they arise.
In the discussion which took place prior ta
the agreement an the statement I have just
read, we ail appreciated that there are
extenuating circumstances, especiaily when
special cammittees are sitting.
Some ai these difficulties have been
brought about by the iact that when witnesses are asked ta appear before a special
camrmittee-mast ai them are not subpoenaed
but are requested-sametimes it is mast diificult ta have them appear at a set haur on a
21498-34

set day oi the week. Cansequently, the camnmittee members must arrange their wark so
that they are available when a witness finds
it passible ta appear bei are them, either in
Ottawa or in other parts ai Canada.
Oi course, as regards the motion we are
dealing with naw an the Committee an Poverty, there will be many extenuating circumstances. I believe that the leaders ai the two
graups in the hanse can ca-aperate with the
chairmen ai bath special and standing committees ta meet the needs ai the chairmen
and ai the committees generally, and I abject
ta giving blanket power ta any cammittee ta
sit while this chamber is in session.
I believe that in extenuating circumnstances
when it is necessary ta grant them the right
ta sit for a day or twa days or perhaps two
weeks when the hause is iiisession, this can
be worked out.
The problem in the past has been that if
blanket power is given ta the chairman of
any cammittee ta sit while the hause is in
session, a chairman ai another committee will
seek ta do the samne thing. We had the experience on many occasions in the previaus session ai this chaxnber being very sparsely
attended-not because senatars were absent
without reasan, but because they were warking on caminittees which were sitting while
this chamber was in session.
1 believe we can accommodate the cha.irmen
and aur caminittees by negotiating the times
when they can sit while the house is in session. I believe that we should ioilow the
recammendatian ai aur chairmen ai committees made this morning, that we should not
give blanket powers ta cammittes ta sit while
the hause is in session.
Hon. Allister Grosart: On that point, I cal
ta your attention that we have new miles in
the Senate, and that Rule 76(4) reads:
A select cammittce shall not sit during
a sitting ai the Senate.
We also have anather mile which requires any
motion ta set aside aur mules, with leave, ta
state "the mile or part thereai pmaposed ta be
suspended". The rule requires that that
be "distinctly stated".
It seems ta me that in many ways we have
develaped a certain casualness about aur
mules. I suggest that if we keep aur mules we
wiil not; get inta the situation wheme it is
taken for granted that we are going ta do

we have new rules, are we going to abide by
them or not? I suggest that in its present
form the motion before the Senate is out of
order because it is conflict with Rule 3, Part 1,

the committee ever sits while we are sitting in
the chamber, it will be by arrangement with
the Leader of the Government side and probably with the Leader on the other side as
well.
We are taking no chances in passing this
motion as presented. Furthermore, when one
considers the importance of the work being
carried on now by the Committee on Poverty
and by its chairman, it becomes evident that
we can waive any technical rules in order to
allow the committee to continue as it has
done in the past.

House.

Hon. Mr. McDonald: Your Honour, I am
probably out of order by rising again, but
with permission I should like to clarify my
position.
We have two motions on the Order Paper
today which were placed there prior to the
meeting held this morning. With respect to
Senator Grosart's statement this afternoon
regarding Rule 76(4) and Rule 3 of Part I, he
is quite right that we are going against our
rules as passed by this chamber during the
last session. It was my hope that no chairman
in the future would bring in a motion drafted
in the wording of the two we have before us
at the moment. So far as I am concerned, I
am prepared to accept those two motions, but
I would hope that it would not happen again.
Hon. Arthur W. Roebuck: Mr. Speaker, I
should like to point out that so far the Senate
Committee on Poverty has held many meetings and has done a wonderful job. As I
remember, it has never encroached upon the
time of the Senate. Practically speaking, we
are risking nothing. I cannot speak for the
chairman, but I am perfectly satisfied that if
[Hon. Mr. Grosart.]

Having said that, let me repeat that I think
the matter should stand at least for a few
hours in order to give us the opportunity to
do some further research into the problem.
Hon. Maurice Lamontagne: Honourable
senators, may I say a few words concerning
this matter?
If this rule is already in force, as I suppose
it to be, I, as Chairman of the Senate Special
Committee on Science Policy, am probably
the greatest off ender against it. I should, however, like to point out that the Senate will do
its most useful work in the future, as it has
done recently, through its committees; not
through debating in this chamber day after
day. We have to plan our work so as to
answer the big questions of the post-industrial society as we see them, as Senator Croll
bas seen them, and as my colleagues on the
Special Committee on Science Policy have
analyzed them. I think that is the best use
that the Senate can be put to in future. That
is my first point.
My second point is that those who are chosen to be members of these committees have to

October 28, 1969

SENATE DEBATES

work day after day. If they cannot sit while
the Senate is sitting, and if they have to sit
on Mondays, Tuesday mornings and Fridays, I
do not think that the work assigned to them
will be done properly. I am quite sure that
the Special Committee on Science Policy
could not have done so much or accomplished
the progress it has, if we had not been able to
sit during sittings of the Senate.
The Committee on Science Policy is not
going to interfere further with the work of
the Senate, because now we will have to
write a report and we can meet at night. But
I think that by adopting the attitude that it
would seem we are about to adopt, judging
from what has been said here, we are weakening unduly this new role of the Senate, this
new usefulness which will affirm itself
through committee work and not through
debating here in the chamber.
Hon. Mr. Grosari: Before the Leader of the
Government rises, I believe that under the
rules I am entitled to make an explanation of
the position that I took.
I was only suggesting that we observe our
ruies. I was not in any way discussing the
substance of the debate which subsequently
developed. I was not saying that committees
should not ever sit when the Senate is sitting.
The whole point on which I rose was merely
that if we have rules, let us keep them.
In this particular case all that was necessary was that the mover of the motion in
respect to the Poverty Committee state, as
our rules require, that in doing so he is
proposing that Rule 3 be suspended. That is
all that is necessary for the senator to do in
order to bring this motion within our Rules.
Hon. Muriel McQ. Fergusson: Honourable
senators, I wish to make a short contribution
to the discussion of this topic because I do not
think it is desirable to have this chamber as
empty as it was many times last year.
I would like to point out to honourable
Senator Lamontagne that there have been
occasions when senators who were dedicated
to the work which they felt they must do,
attended committee meetings on Mondays and
Fridays. This was the situation in dealing
with the work of the Divorce Committee. It
may not have been in your opinion an important committee, but it was work that was
required by the Senate, and for years many
of the members of that committee attended
not only the normal sitting days of the Senate
but on Monday and Friday as well. I am

saying this to point out that the work can be
done if honourable senators are interested in
the work they are doing.
Hon. Paul Martin: Honourable senators, we
are grateful to Senator Grosart for raising
this question, not only because he has correctly pointed to the purport of our new rules,
but because he enables us to examine, as we
should, a problem that has been of concern to
those who have to organize the business of
the Senate. This discussion can take place
without trying in any way to derogate from
what Senator Lamontagne has said about the
very important work in the field of his
nquiry.
Our task is to reconcile our legislative
responsibilities, for we are a house of sober
second thought, with opportunity for making
contributions in the field of inquiry. No one
wants to restrict the work of any committee.
Certainly, as I listen to Senator Croll, I
am sure none of us would want to restrict the important work which the Committee on Poverty has undertaken. Nevertheless,
we do have responsibilities in this chamber.
One of the historic functions of the Senate,
indeed one of the conditions under which
Confederation came into being, was that the
Senate would discharge certain functions in
its legislative capacity. We cannot shrink
from that responsibility. None of us would
wish to do so. We have to reconcile that
responsibility with the obligations that confront the chairman,, particularly of a committee as important as that on poverty.
I agree with Senator Grosart that rules are
made to help us to dispatch our business in
an orderly way. It would have been an idle
effort to have spent all the time last year in
Senator Molson's committee if we were to
disregard the rules. But the fault is not that
of Senator Croll. Perhaps it is my fault, inasmuch as I did not draw attention to Rule
76(4) and also to the enabling provision in
Rule 3. I think it is well that we should
provide in our Rules that "A select committee
shall not sit during a sitting of the Senate" as
a statement of principle.
As honourable senators are aware, we had
situations last year that were very difficult.
We had a vote in this chamber which I am
sure did not represent the concensus of the
views of the Senate. The vote was taken
when there was barely a quorum present and
when members were engaged in three committees of this house which were sitting
simultaneously. Two of those committees

SENATE DEBATES
were special committees to wbom bad been
extended tbe pnivilege of sitting while the
bouse was sitting. In this chamber we do flot
sit many days in tbe week to disebharge our
functions as a forum. Normally, we sit Tuesday afternoon and evening, Wednesday and
Tbursday afternoon and sometimes Thursday
evening. Therefore, it seems to me that we
can do aur work in the committees and oun
work in the Chamben if we have an understanding between the committee chairmen
and those wbo manage the business of the
bouse.
We are grateful to Senaton McDonald, wbo
called tagether the chairmen of the committees this morning. Wbene chairmen cauld not
themnselves attend, their representatives were
present. An agreement was reached whicb I
think will provide for the orderly dispatcb of
the business of the Senate and of its
committees.
Senator Croll bas tald us that beginning
next week his committee is going ta hold
sessions in variaus parts of the country. That
is the decision of the committee. Obviously, if
the work 0f the cammittee is ta be undertaken, an exception must be provided ta Rule 3
to enable bim to carry on this outside wark 0f

think there sbould be fia difficulty in our

approval. I tbink that is the way to salve this
problem.
I came now to Senator Lamontagne's
motion. At first I tbaught that I should not
deal with tbis matten at this stage, but on
second tbaugbt I bave decided to do s0
because it will explain the pnoblem more
clearly. Senaton Lamontagne's committee bas

Therefone, hie could very well argue with

house. But, as Senator Lamontagne has pointed out, his committee will flot be holding
further sessions, that problema is resolved.
Hon. Mr. Lamontagne: And I shall fot initiate anather committee under the new Rules.
Hon. Mr. Martin: He says bie wauld not
initiate another committee under the new
Rules. That is what hie says at the moment,
but I happen to know the kind of man Senator Lamontagne is. He is a man who carnies
out functions with the greatest dispatch.
Therefore, I suggest that a motion be put
along the lines indicated by Senator Grosart.
This will give empbasis to the desirability
that the kind of agreement reached this
morning by the chairmen of the committees
be observed. If that is done, I am sure we
shall have no difficulty in the discharge of aur
business.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Honourable senators, I
move that Motion No. 1 be amended by
inserting after the word "Senate" in the
fourth paragraph the words "and that Rule
76(4) be suspended accordingly." That paragraph as amended will read:
That the Committee be authorized to
print such papers and evidence from day
to day as may be ordered by the Committee, ta sit during sittings and adjournments of the Senate, and that Rule 76(4)
be suspended accordingly.
The Hon. the Speaker: May I ask the
honourable senator to submit a draft of bis
amendment.
Hon. Mr. Roebuc.k: I will hand it to the
Clerk.
The Hon. the Speaker: While the amendment is being prepared, honourable senators,
may I come back to the point raised by the
honourable Senator Grosart, in order that it
is fully understood.
I have not said that the motion by the
banourable Senator Croli is contrary to one of
the rules. In bis motion the honourable senaton is asking permission to sit during sittings
of the Senate. If this is by leave, then honourable senators by giving unanimous consent
can grant this permission notwithstanding
Rule 76. It is only in the event that unanimous consent is not granted, as is the case
now, that this amendaient is requîred. That is
my understanding of bonourable Senaton
Grosart's point.

most sincere condolences.
It is difficult for a man to lose any loved
one, but it is especially difficuit to, lose the one
who gave him. 111e, who guided and protected
hlm through his formative years, and who
saw him safely into manhood. Mothers seem
ail to have a way of becoming a part o! their
offspring. As a result, when such a beloved
creature passes on, the grief o! a dutiful and
loving son must be ineffable. We extend to
Senator Flynn our profound sympathy.
Under the circumstances, it becomes incumbent upon me as Deputy Leader of our party
in tlie Senate to deliver the Opposition's first
reply to the Speech fromn the Thirone. However, before laundliag into the diatribe
against the Throne Speech, whlch the Government Leader lias indicated lie expects,
may 1 be permitted, honourable senators, a
f ew less venomous remarks.
21498-4j

I should first like to thank our honourable
Speaker, Senator Deschatelets, for the incomparably efficient way lin which he has guided
this chaxnber through its deliberations. It is,
evident the man is endowed with the wisdom.
of Solomon and the patience of Job.
To the honourable Senator Martin I extend
my most lieartfelt condolences on the loss, of
a few days ago, of lis brother.
I would add that the flrst session has made
it quite manifest that the Goverrnent Leader
in the Senate negotiated the transition from
the frenetic Commons to the placid Senate
without any iii effects. I arn thus led to conclude that he is really very happy here with
us-as happy as we are to have an aggressive,
stlmulating, articulate and shrewd gentleman
with whom to cross swords.
To Senator Desruisseaux who moved the
motion for an Address in Reply, I sliould like
to say that it is always a pleasure to listen to
so erudite and eloquent a gentleman. It does
lead to confusion, however, for after his
laudatory analysis of the Throne Speech, I
just could not believe we both had listened to
the same Throne Speech last Thrusday
morning.
I wish also to extend congratulations to
Senator Everett. The honourable gentleman's
allocution seconding the motion for an
Address in Reply bore ail the marks of a
highly incisive mind. Ris pellucid analysis of
the problemn of regional disparities led me ta
hope that hie would continue to address himself to the major problems which affiict this
country. Certainly we would ail be interested
to learn what lie sees as possible solutions.
Wîth your permission, honourable senators,
I shail now proceed to apprise you of my
assessmnent of the content of the Speech fromn
the Tlirone.
It is manifest fromn this, the second excuse
for a Tlirone Speech by the present administration, that the Government is devoid of
purpose; that it lacks direction; that it is
wailowing in a quagmire of indecision. In
effect, it was a plethora of platitudes.
A Throne Speech is supposed to dhart the
course, to set the theme for the coming year
or so. Where we are going remains a mystery
even after the Throne Speech. Someone in the
Prime Minister's vast retinue sliould have
told the right honourable gentleman that you
do not off er comic relief at the beginning of a
rnystery story.

SENATE DEBATES
What is indeed alarming is that the Government appears to take the document seriously as a Speech from the Throne and actually believes that this barren essay, this frank
admission of an inability to cope with serious
problems, is an adequate way to launch the
country into the decade of the seventies.
The present administration bas had close to
a year and a half to dispose of legislation left
over from the Pearson administration. It takes
a great deal of culinary artistry to prepare
leftovers in such a way as to make them
palatable. This Government is not about to
have conferred upon it any "cordon bleu".
This second session of the present Parliament should display clearly what the term
"Just Society" entails. Would anybody be surprised to find that it was just another of those
meaningless political slogans?
What the people of this country were
expecting was a Throne Speech that would
have provided an agenda for action, an
unequivocal statement of priorities, and an
untempered expression of the concerns of
national government. Instead, it is clear the
Government plans to while away the session
in a leisurely, academic discussion of a veritable blizzard of white papers. The Government
might be said to be "dropping out" for a year.
There is not a word in the Throne Speech
about overall national development plans for
the future; not a word about education,
training, or opportunities for individual
development.
The Canadian people are tiring of the
cheap excuses this administration bas proffered for its lack of decision and direction.
The heap of confusion that this Government
inherited from the previous one should have
been disposed of long ago. As for the second
popular excuse, that nothing far-reaching can
be undertaken in the present state of the
economy, I would never have thought this
administration would have had the temerity
to offer such a justification for inaction.
This Government is just as guilty as that
which preceded it of allowing the economy to
get out of hand. The fiscal myopia which
characterized the Pearson years obviously
proved to be contagious.
The Liberals, since they took over the reins
of government six years ago, have gone
through three Ministers of Finance-each one
more obtuse than his predecessor. They have
consistently misread the state of the economy,
mistimed their economic policies and, in most
[Hon. Mr. Choquette.]

October 28, 1969

cases, aggravated rather than solved our economic problems.
For nearly five years the governments of
this
country have employed measures
designed to encourage inflation. Their own
expert consultants warned them that they
were courting disaster. The warnings went
unheeded and the result has been rampant
inflation. Why waste the taxpayers' money
hiring expensive advisers if you have no
intention whatsoever of listening to them?
The Economic Council of Canada has
warned this Government that its anti-inflation policies of fiscal and monetary restraint
could plunge us into a recession because the
policies are essentially aimed at the wrong
targets. I quote from the Economic Council of
Canada report:
Further fiscal and monetary restraint
could conceivably result simply in higher
rates of unemployment and economic
slack with no more than marginal effects
on current rates of increase in prices and
costs.
The Economic Council bas pointed out that
the inflation which presently afflicts us is
more in the nature of a cost-push than a
demand-pull. The distinction becomes important when one is contemplating the degree of
severity to employ in monetary and fiscal
restraints to control inflation.
Cost-push inflation is primarily caused by
excessive wage demands. More consideration
must be given, therefore, to controlling the
wage spiral than to raising taxes, reducing
government spending and tightening credit.
The Government, however, instead of trying
harder to convince labour unions to be more
reasonable in their demands has chosen the
other course. It bas intensified its monetary
and fiscal restraints rather than follow the
advice of the Economic Council. The result
will be an inevitable drastic increase in
unemployment.

It is callous indeed to fight inflation by
having recourse to the deliberate creation of
unemployment. It is tantamount to wilfully creating a frightful mess, then having
someone else clean it up.
Rather than insensitively forcing people out
of work, the Government should concentrate
on steering the economy into a smoother continuing pattern of demand growth. Some sort
of coherent system for establishing national
priorities must be devised to replace the present haphazard approach.

October 28. 1969

SENATE DEBATES

Too frequently in the past four or five
years priorities have been established and
objectives decided upon in isolation, on an ad
hoc basis, with no reference whatever to an
overall framework of goals; programs have
been embarked upon having no sounder basis
than a welter of insufficiently considered
ideas. The result has been manifest waste,
especially apparent in the welfare field which
comprises the largest single component of
government spending.
In spite of the huge amounts of money
spent by the federal Government on welfare,
this administration with its genius for inefficiency still manages to short-change people.
There is a crying need for a yearly increase
in the old age security pension proportionate
to the increase in the cost of living index. As
it stands now, the old age security pension is
raised two per cent per annum while the cost
of living has, in recent years, risen by four or
five per cent each year. As a result, those on
fixed incomes have had again to bear the
brunt of this Government's inability to deal
effectively with monsters of its own creation.
I have said this before and I say it again, that
these welfare payments must be geared to
the cost of living, that is, payable in constant
dollars.
Again with reference to the present welfare
program of the federal Government, the Economic Council has had this to say:
Welfare assistance is provided in a manner and amount that all too frequently
undermines, rather than reinforces, the
abilities and aspirations of recipients to
participate productively in the economic
system.
The program does not provide incentives to
people to get off welfare rolls; it is, in effect,
destructive of initiative, self-reliance, and
self-respect.
The Economic Council suggests, and we see
great merit in their suggestions:
a) the creation of a federal-provincial program for continuing studies of national
goals and priorities that would set out
cost and manpower requirements for
obtaining specific objectives;
b) ensuring that the results of studies are
made available to Parliament, the provincial legislatures, and the public as essential background for decisions on the allocation of resources.
New programs, if there are to be any,
should be financed by increased administrative efficiency in the existing programs and

by the elimination of schemes that have
served their purpose and are no longer
necessary.
If we are to solve the problem of poverty in
Canada, we must think in terms of developing
the income-earning capacities of those who
are below the poverty Une. This is what we
heard from Senator Croll today. This can be
achieved-and again I refer to the suggestion
of the Economic Council-by
(a) improved and expanded employment
opportunities through better labour market information;
(b) improved and expanded education
and training opportunities in the form of
special efforts to upgrade skills, reduce
the number of dropouts, and enable poor
families to increase earning potential;
and
(c) income maintenance policies as an
essential complement to more direct
efforts to expand employment and educational opportunities.
To recapitulate, if we are ever to solve the
problem of poverty, the Manpower Department will have to start doing what it was
designed to do, that is, to retrain and, if
necessary, relocate, as well as direct, people
to openings in the labour market. We all hope
that the Special Committee of the Senate on
Poverty will come up with some answers, but
the Government itself is obviously fumbling
in this area.
We received with a great deal of
enthusiasm the reference in the Speech from
the Throne to the Government's intention to
lower the voting age to 18. If the Government
is going to please these future voters, it will
have to change, and change drastically. Needless to say, any change in this instance will
have to constitute an improvement, so we
have reason to be hopeful.
Young people today want "to do their own
thing." Much as this may sound anarchic, it is
not for the most part. Rather it is indicative
of independence, self-reliance, and even
maturity. It is, therefore, laudable, for the
vast majority of our young adults do not forget that doing one's thing carries with it obligations and responsibilities to others.
Those students who are today annoyed at
the Establishment may have some right to be.
Organized technological society is massive
and impersonal. People are treated as mere
computer in-puts. We seem to have lost control of our society. The "Thing" is running us.
The system is the tail that wags the dog.

SENATE DEBATES
This, young people object to; they find our
welfare state too impersonal, unfeeling, and
removed from reality. Much as it may be run
by people, our society is more preoccupied
with efficiency than it is conscious of people
or concerned about them. This would not be
so bad if governments, at least, developed a
respectable degree of efficiency in their dealings with people, but most of them have not,
and this Government certainly has not.
If the young people of Canada have noticed
that they are being moulded by this large
amorphous mass called society, they are to be
commended. If they are perspicacious enough
to note that society itself is being inspected,
directed, and protected by an ubiquitous and
overbearing central government, then they
ought to be encouraged to run for office. We
are in dire need of men of insight.
The young adults of this country are
knowledgeable, sophisticated, and fiercely
independent. They have a gift for seeing
through people. Hence they are not likely to
be fooled as their parents were in the last
couple of general elections.
With reference to the matter of pollution,
we are in full agreement with the principle of
establishing a special committee of the Senate
to identify the problems of environmental
destruction and the setting up of structures to
solve them. I understand the committee's aim
would be to set out the basis for a national
policy on environmental control, make recommendations for the establishment of a federal
administrative body to implement the policy,
and examine how provincial and territorial
policy could be brought into harmony with
national policy.
Here is an opportunity for us in the Senate
to help the Government out of yet another
sorry mess. The nucleus of the solution lies in
reaching an agreement on the proper sharing
of responsibilities among the federal, provincial and municipal levels of government. A
more than adequate system of consultation
will have to be set up among the three levels
of government and it will have to be used
extensively.
The Senate as well as some of its committees should play a part in the field of constitutional revision, in the field of the redistribution of legislative powers.
It should, therefore, be one of the first tasks
of the new committee charged with looking
into the problem of pollution to determine
what responsibilities each level of government recognizes as its own. Hopefully, we
[Hon. Mr. Choquette.]

October 28, 1969

will end up with overlapping rather than
with a passel of grey zones for which no one
feels responsible.
Responsibility having been agreed upon, we
can then move on in a co-operative fashion to
the consideration of policies and solutions.
Before terminating, I should like to address
myself to the subject of Senate reform.
Nobody in the world has come in for more
well-intentioned diagnoses of ailment and
prescriptions for cure than the Senate of
Canada.
The Prime Minister's White Paper on Constitutional Reform published last February
had some proposals for the reform of this
institution. It suggested first that the Senate:
- be reorganized so as to provide for the
expression in it in a more direct and
formal manner than at present of the
interests of the provinces and regions of
Canada.
No one would disagree that the principle of
regional representation was clearly stronger
in the minds of the Fathers of Confederation
than any idea of giving the provinces and
regions numerically proportional representation in the Senate.
Most of us here have acted little to fulfil
our role as regional representatives. I suppose
we felt the people in the other place were
doing a fairly commendable job of that. Or
maybe we felt that as senators we should rise
above the tendency to defend petty regional
interests. One thing is clear: the other place
does not pay sufficient attention to regional
and provincial interests. They are more concerned with Canada as a whole. If we follow
this course, we will be indulging in a useless
duplication of effort.
Therefore, I am led to conclude that the
Senate's oldest raison d'être is also its most
current-it should serve the interests of the
provinces.
Since 1867, the pendulum of power has
swung between federal and provincial governments. Most of the problems that needed
collective action are now solved. More of the
governing of the country could and should be
done at the provincial level. However, it is
silly to suppose that if Ottawa continued to
have exclusive right to appoint senators,
strong supporters of provincial autonomy
would ever find a place in this hallowed
chamber.
The Government's suggestion that the Senate be selected partly by the federal and partly by the provincial governments is, I believe,

October 28, 1969

Octobr 28,1969SENATE
DEBATES

a healthy one. Ail that needs to, be worked
out now is the method of procedure to be
employed in this co-operative effort. It is the
details surrounding such arrangements that
are usuaily generative of so much friction.
It is further suggested in the white paper
that a senator's term, of office be limited,
rnaybe to six years, with the possibility of
renewal. What are to, be the criteria used in
determining whether a senator's term is to be
renewed? Who la to establisb these criteria?
Who is to stand in judgment? I should flot be
surprised if the Governrnent bas no answers
to these questions. It is notorious for not
doing its homework.
Ail these changes that the Governrnent
proposes to effectuate in the Senate niight
very weil be for the better. However, in my
judgment this is a situation where graduaism.
should be the order of the day. What will
have been gained if in our eagerness to
refurbish oui image we, in effect, throw the
baby out with the bath water? Above ail, let
us avoid the evil of impatience.
In closing, I would say to the Governmnent:
Get on with the task of leading this country.
Give
Up your

Housekeepers are a dime a dozen, or at least
used to be. Rid yoursclves of your obsession

Surely you have more ta off er the public

Hon. Paul Marin: Honourable senators, I
should like to join the Deputy Leader of the
Opposition <Hon. Mr. Choquette) ini saying ta
the mover (Hon. Mr. Desruisseaux) and the
seconder (Hon. Mr. Everett) that they discharged their assignment with great credit ta
themselves.
[Translation]
1 wlsh to extend my most sincere
congratulations to Senator Desruisseaux for
the speech he delivered here last Thursday.
As always, it was the speech of a cautious,
wise and able man.
I sbould like ta say ta, Senator Everett that
I thougbt bis speech foilowed the pattern, in
the reaction it created, of Senatar Desruisseaux. They were two outstanding contributions. Senator Everett made, I thought, a

respansible statement, interpreting the mood
of that portion of the country from whicb he
cames, a portion of the country that feels
oftentimes that it is neglected. That, of
course, is not the case. But it is weil that we
should be reminded what people in Western
Canada do think. No one has interpreted the
relations of Western Canada ta, the rest of
Canada better, in my judgment, in a long
time than the speech Senator Everett delivered in this bouse on Thuisday last.
I should like ta say that I, too, regret very
rnuch the circumstances that have prevented
the Leader of the Opposition (Hon. Mr.
Flynn) from being in bis seat tonight. I join
with the Deputy Leader of the Opposition in
expressing oui sincere sympathy ta Senator
Flynn and ta the members of bis faniily on
the passing of his mother. I amn grateful ta
Senator Choquette for what he said about my
own sorrow of recent days, samething on
wbich 1 arn not anxious ta dweil. Sinoe it bas
been mentianed I should like ta say ta ail
senators that I arn grateful for their kind
thaughts in this situation.
And too, I agree with Senatar Choquette
tbat we owe a special word of thanks ta His
Honour the Speaker for the efficient way in
which he presides over oui deliberations.
I would like ta congratulate Senatar Choquette on the effort wbich he bas just completed. He wM not; expect me to accept ail the
pulsations of that speech or ta agree wlth ail
bis conclusions. 1 must say that, having made
a few speeches in opposition myseif, I have
had some experience abaut the menit of opposition speeches. Using that yardstlck, I would
say that in the absence of bis leader tanlgbt
he creditcd bimself witb unusual distinction.
He will not expect me ta comment on ail of
the criticisms he made of the administration. I
would like to say at once that I do take strong
issue, however, with bis statement that the
Goverument lacked decision and purpose.
I have served ini four Governments, including the present administration. Each of these
Goverrnents had its menit and is achievements. This Government cannot be characterfred as one that lacks decision and purpose.
The capacity of the Government ta make
decisions, and the fact that the Government
bas purpose, is reflected i the character and
i the leadership of the man wbo beads the
Government. If a gavernment is lacking In
decision and is lacking in purpose, the reason
will normaily be found lIn the persan of the
bead of governmnent. I believe that I refiect

SENATE DEBATES
the judgment of the vast majority of the people of the country at the present time. I hope
that this will not be construed as a narrow
political observation, but I do say that the
present Prime Minister reflects, as few leaders of government, the mood and the desires
of the nation. This is shown in his pronouncements. I think it was reflected in what he said
today about a matter that I wish to say something about tonight. I also think it was
reflected in a speech he made the other day
in the City of Montreal. It is reflected in his
capacity for direct statement, oftentimes in
his understatements. On those occasions he
bears in mind that it is well to catch up
rather than to find one has taken a position
from which one bas to retreat. No, I believe
that this Government and this Prime Minister
has purpose and decision. This Government is
making and has made decisions, some of them
extremely difficult, as we found during the
course of the last few months in pursuing a
policy of retrenchment and reduction of Government expenditures. I think the Prime Minister, in his concept of the nature of our
Confederation and in his view of the nature
of some of our problems, both domestic and
foreign, stands out as a man of stature, one
whose leadership is not only bringing attention to himself in Canada, but bringing to
himself attention in many countries of the
world.
In opening my reply to what the Deputy
Leader of the Opposition has said, I wish to
assure him that from all that I see in the
Cabinet and from the unfolding of Government policies, we will see some of them
already portrayed in the Speech from the
Throne. A suggestion that this is a Government that lacks decision and lacks purpose is
not open to substantiation.
During the course of his speech, Senator
Choquette referred to what is undoubtedly
the most serious problem facing the country
at the present time, one that Professor
Galbraith, the distinguished American economist, spoke about on Saturday and yesterday
at the Tripartite Conference here in Ottawa.
This is a matter that was referred to in the
other place last night by the Minister of
Finance and again today by the Prime Minister, and recently by the Governor of the Bank
of Canada and, as Senator Choquette pointed
out, a few weeks ago by the Chairman of the
Economic Council of Canada. This question is
one which should be of concern not only to
the other house but it should be of concern,
as I know it is, to senators in this house. I
[Hon. Mr. Martin.]

October 28, 1969

hope that it will gain the attention of some of
our committees just as it is receiving attention in other committees in the other place
and in some of the legislatures of the
provinces.
The fact is that the major challenge to
government and to all Canadians at this time
is the problem of inflation and the inflation
psychology. As a government, Senator Choquette suggested that we were remiss in our
confrontation with this problem. We have
tackled inflation on many levels. In the first
place we have reduced the rate of increase of
our own expenditures by cutting back severely the scope of operation of various government departments and agencies. We felt that
the level of expenditure on federal accoaunt in
Canada had reached proportions which stood
in the way of a ready solution to inflation. We
were not the only government that had
overexpended; we were not the only level of
government that had overexpended. The
expenditures of provincial governments, both
collectively and individually, as the Finance
Committee reported in this Senate last June,
reveals that their expenditures exceed those
of the federal Government. That is their
responsibility. We felt that if we were going
to curb this inflation we had to embark on a
program of reduction of expenditures, with
the result that the Minister of Finance would
be faced with the opportunity of presenting a
surplus and, as be indicated yesterday, that
surplus will be even larger, he anticipates,
than his earlier expectations.
The Government has established an
Incomes Commission under the chairmanship
of an eminent economist to inquire into and
report upon the causes, processes and consequences of inflation and to inform government and management and labour how price
stability may be best achieved. My honourable friend may say that this Incomes Commission has no more authority than that of persuasion. Those of us who are lawyers know
that a judgment sometimes may be either
authoritative or persuasive. Even persuasive
judgments have their value. This commission's authority may be no more than educational, it may be no more than persuasive;
but that is because of the limitation of the
Constitution in giving direct authority to the
federal Government in the matter of the control of prices, wages and profits.
There might be some area yet to be dealt
with in the field of credit; but generally
speaking the kind of objective which was put

October 28, 1969

SENATE DEBATES

before the Canadian people by Professor Galbraith in a committee in the other place yesterday is not easy of application in Canada.
He pointed out that in the United States it is
possible, by a single act of the Congress,
to establish a system of controls more effectively to meet inflation. We know that
that is not the situation in our country.
What the President of the Economic Council was referring to the other day, in the
statement which was made in his Sixth
Annual Report, I think was essentially
addressed more to the long-term than to the
short-term. In any event it should be remembered that the Economic Council is a body
which represents not only one element. It
represents management, it represents labour,
it represents agriculture, it represents the
expert, it represents the economist, it represents the academic community. In other
words, it is a body which often must make
compromises in order to reach conclusions. If
Senator Choquette draws comfort from the
statement of the President of the Economic
Council, I would ask him to look at the statement made the other day by the Governor of
the Bank of Canada. Some of the observations
made by Mr. Rasminsky, contrasted with
those made by the Chairman of the Economic
Council, will show that the general course
which the Government is taking, in the circumstances, is one which warrants support,
warrants perhaps a greater appreciation than
is sometimes given to current Government
policies.
The Government has not rested with this
commission. The Government also bas been
working through the Bank of Canada in the
enactment of monetary policies to restrain the
supply of credit. The success of this restrictive monetary policy is reflected in the fact
that by May of 1969, after these policies had
been in effect for approximately six months,
the more liquid assets of the banks, which
provide the cushion which enables them to
expand their lending activity, had been
reduced by more than three-quarters of a
billion dollars, and the ratio of their more
liquid assets to their total assets had fallen
from 32j per cent to 28 per cent, a level
which is low by historical standards.
The impact of reductions in government
expenditures can be seen in the fact that
while in the twelve months ending September
1968 the Government's overall cash requirements, excluding those of the Exchange Fund,
were $1,200 million in the twelve months end-

ing September 1969 there was a net cash
availability of nearly $100 million. This large
swing has been of great assistance to the
Bank of Canada in controlling bank liquidity
during the past year. Had it been necessary to
deal with a large increase in public debt at a
time when monetary policy was directed
towards reducing the liquid assets of the
banking system, it is obvious that the increase
in interest rates would have had to be even
greater than it was, or the growth of the
money supply would have had to be larger.
Some argue, and I think this is implied in
what Senator Choquette said, that the Government in the interest of higher welfare
payments, in the interest of maintaining
employment,
in
encouraging
economic
growth, should ease its restrictive monetary
policies at the present time, for fear of precipitating a recession.
I say to Senator Choquette and to all
honourable senators that the available evidence does not support that position. For
example, the consumer price index bas
increased in the months of June, July and
August of 1969 as much or more than in
the same months of 1968.
It is also alleged that the Government's
anti-inflationary policy has produced unemployment in Canada. This is not the case.
Recent figures from the Dominion Bureau of
Statistics indicate that the total employment
in Canada is 2.6 per cent higher than it was
one year ago and that the unemployment figure of 5.0 per cent for September 1969, the
most recent figure available, is only 0.2 per
cent higher than the figure for 1968 and is in
fact lower than the figures for June and July
1968.
Therefore, in short, the Government's policies aimed at reducing inflation cannot at this
stage be said to have failed. I am not saying
that the problem is an easy one. I am not
saying that we are succeeding in every sector.
We had a rise the day before yesterday in
steel prices. But I am saying that, in the
Government's view at this time, whatever
else may be done, it would not be appropriate
to alter the policies of the Government in its
effort to try and curb inflation.
No one for one moment doubts the seriousness of this problem and certainly the Governor of the Bank of Canada, quite properly, in
his statement of October 23, outlines what
inflation means in Canada. He pointed out
that quite apart from the serious inequities it
involves and the unfair sacrifices it inflicts on

SENATE DEBATES
those in the weakest bargaining position,
including older people, the process of inflation
and the demand to adjust inflation, introduces
tensions and disturbances into the economic
process which are bound to result in an
unsatisfactory economie performance. Then
he went on, almost by way of warning, to say
that as more and more people try to adjust to
inflation, more and more pressure is put on
costs and prices, and restrictive policies are
needed simply to keep inflation from
accelerating. Nothing is gained in the process
in terms of output and employment, and people are put to a substantial and unnecessary
degree of inconvenience and anxiety in an
attempt to keep up with inflation.
It is taking, Mr. Rasminsky said, a very
short-run view to believe that the tolerance
of inflation can result in a higher level of real
output or less unemployment. The inflation
jeopardizes the kind of long-run economic
expansion on which durable growth in
employment depends.
Now, it is suggested by some that our policy is inconsistent with these public declarations of the Governor of the Bank of Canada,
that it is resulting in an over-kill. That
phrase has been used by an eminent political
personality in this country. There is the danger of over-kill, but there is nothing in what
the Governor of the Bank suggests to indicate
that we have reached that point.
Here is what he says about the consequences of the present Government's prograni
of combatting inflation within the limitations
of the constitutional provisions that are open
to a federal government in Canada. He said:
I believe that there is accumulating evidence that policies of restraint are beginning to take hold, both here and in the
United States.
Now, that is the statement of the Governor
of the Bank of Canada. The Minister of
Finance in the light of this statement was
justified in saying that by no means has the
Government concluded that what it is trying
now to do to combat inflation should be
altered.
The Governor of the Bank of Canada went
on to say:
Unfortunately, an accurate assessment of
most of our own economic indicators
since the first quarter has been complicated by a number of major strikes
which have had an influence that is dif[Hon. Mr. Martin.]

October 28, 1969

ficult to isolate. Even so, after making
due allowance for all the temporary dislocations, it would seem that the underlying trend of demand in this country is no
longer increasing nearly as rapidly as it
was in the period up to the first quarter
of this year.
These are not the statements of any of my
colleagues in the Government. These are the
statements of the Governor of the Bank of
Canada.
And here is what he said in sunimary:
- while there are indications that policies of restraint are beginning to work
and that we are on the right track, I
think that it would be too optimistic to
conclude that these policies have now
done the full job of creating conditions
that will eventually lead to a significant
reduction in the rate of price and cost
increase. In saying this, I am well aware
of the inevitable time-lags that exist both
in the adjustment of prices and costs to
easier demand conditions and in the
response of the economy to policy
changes.
Honourable senators, I mentioned Professor
Galbraith and the observations he made to a
parliamentary committee yesterday, and what
he said to the tripartite conference and what
he said in a lecture at the University of
Ottawa on Saturday night. Great attachment
will be given to his words.
Today the Prime Minister indicated the
Government's great concern with inflation. He
said that we have resorted to a program of
retrenchment, a program of guidelines, a program of persuasion. The Minister of Consumer Affairs is active within the context of his
ministerial responsibilities. Every occasion is
taken to point out the dangers of inflation to
wage-earners, to those on fixed incomes. The
Prime Minister went on to say that we simply
have got to meet this problem. I am now
paraphrasing his words. They indicate the
serious view he takes of the problem: that, if
necessary, he would be prepared to discuss
with the provinces ways and means of finding
other measures, if necessary, to deal with the
problem. He did not say that he would; but
he did indicate, by his concern about the
suggestion of controls and the constitutional
limitations connected therewith, that this is
the kind of matter which a government faced
with this serious problem must not hesitate to
study. And I strongly recommend the reading

October 28, 1969

SENATE DEBATES

of what the Prime Minister said, when tomorrow honourable senators will have the
opportunity.
I refer ta what he said only ta indicate that,
in addition ta what I have said tonight about
what we believe ta be the success thus far
of some of our efforts, the Government
continues to give the matter in an over-all
way much more fundamental concern and
approach than some are prepared ta recognize
the Government is doing.
I have thought in reply ta my honourable
friend that I should address myself essentially
ta this problem, because it was the basis of
much of his complaint. It is basic today all
over this country. The Government of the
country is therefore obliged ta give the fullest
consideration ta ways and means of dealing
with this problem. The Government can
only do so much within the limit of its constitutional power. But private sector has a great
responsibility, and so has labour.
My honourable friend said, if I understood
him right, that inflation was caused by an
undue rise in wages. Well, surely inflation is
caused by this, but also by other undue rises
in other areas of the economy. Al sectors of
the community must accept their responsibility in a voluntary way through voluntary
restraints, if the federal Government within
the ambit of its constitutional power is going
ta deal successfully with this problem.
In the Speech from the Throne the Government did, of course, stray from the traditional
pattern of similar speeches. There was an
annex to the speech which indicated the Government's legislative program. There was also
in the annex a list of the legislative program
passed in the other place and in the Senate
during the course of the last session of Parlia:ment. It is true, as Senator Choquette said,
that much of this program comprised hangover legislation-bits of legislation left over
from the previous regime. I may say that
some of these bits of legislation were hangavers from the administration before that.
The House of Commons bas revised some of
its procedures and it is hoped that it will be
able ta dispatch its business in a way that
will not permit a repetition of such a long
time being taken in the implementation of the
legislative program. But let there be no mistake that in this present Speech from the
Throne, philosophical as it may be, in part,
general as its phrases may seem ta be, there
is a clear plan and a clear design and purpose. This Government is planning its work;
it is planning its work carefully; and the

evidence of that planning will in the course
of the next few months be unfolded in a way
which, I trust, will satisfy even my genial
friend Senator Choquette.
An Hon. Senator: Never.
Hon. Mr. Martin: Someone says never. I do
not possess that kind of pessimism. I have
convinced Senator Choquette before and I am
sure that I can convince him even in this
difficult area.
The Speech from the Throne speaks of the
international situation; it speaks of our concern in the Arctic archipelago; it speaks of
the development of international law; it
speaks of what we are seeking ta do at the
United Nations ta strengthen that organization; it speaks of national unity. It mentions
with pride the legislative accomplishment last
session of the language bill. That is now a
legislative fact. The Government is presently
engaged in further discussions with the provinces, designed ta implement that bill and ta
implement some of the recommendations of
the B. and B. Report.
The problem of national unity continues ta
be one of our forenost problems together
with that of economic disparity and inflation.
These are pre-eminent among the problems
that face not only the Government but also
Parlianient and the people of the country.
Senator Choquette mentioned at the outset
that I seem ta be fitting into the pattern and
the traditions of this chamber. I thank him
for that. But if that is the case, it is largely
because I have had co-operation not only
from those who sit on this side but from those
who sit opposite. I am sure that Senator Choquette is right in saying that this chamber,
this institution, the subject of much abuse
almost from the time of its establishment,
serves a good purpose in our parliamentary
system. I am sure that we would not be true
ta the Fathers of Confederation and ta the
purpose of that arrangement if we were ta
undo one of the necessary conditions which
brought this house into being, largely at the
insistence of the Atlantic Provinces and the
Province of Quebec.
Our job now is ta make ourselves more
useful. The criticisms levelled at the Senate
are oftentimes made in the context of a criticism directed against Parliament itself; the
charge being that Parliament is meaningless,
that Parliament is irrelevant in the modern
day. Those of us who are in Parliament in
one or other of the houses cannot ignore that

SENATE DEBATES
indictment. The charge is made every day in
many ways, on television, in the newspapers,
and in the university lecture room, that Parliament is an irrelevant institution. I do not
believe that we should indulge in self-praise;
I think we should be aware, as Senator Choquette is, of our shortcomings and of the need
to correct ourselves and our operations to
justify confidence in the mandate given us. I
think at the sane time we should recognize
that we have, in this chamber particularly, an
opportunity to meet the challenge that is
directed against Parliament.
The suggestion that great issues in this
country should be resolved by a public
d alogue in which Parliament does not take
part is a threat to our free society. Let no one
think that the dialogue does take place only
between Parliament and the people. The
dialogue, as I see it, in this contracted society
of ours, with television and other communications media, is oftentimes between the people
and those who are set up to report the activities of those who were either elected or
appointed to do the job involved in the enacting of legislation. But the dialogue should not
be only between them. They should report the
dialogue-and are free to comment on itthat ought to be between Parliament and the
people on all the great issues. We in this
house have a special opportunity since we are
not bogged down by heavy government programs. It need not mean that we must reach
decisions on every matter; it need not mean
that we have to have a concensus on every

October 28, 1969

subject. That is not the nature of a deliberative assembly. In the United Nations they are
now learning that there is a value in debate
and in discussion and in that kind of projection even though it may not lead always to
firm conclusions. This Senate can take an
additional step forward by addressing itself to
these vital issues, thereby making a contribution as well as justifying its existence in this
federation of ours.
Honourable senators, the debate on the
Speech from the Throne is intended to enable
us not necessarily to discuss all the measures
mentioned in the speech-there is nothing to
preclude such a detailed examination if one
wishes to make it-but it is an occasion on
which we are entitled to address ourselves, as
Senator Choquette and I have sought to do
this evening, to some of the major issues that
confront the country. Having done that, and
before I take my seat, let me assure Senator
Choquette of one thing that is certain. It is
that this government of which I am a member
is alive to its problems, has a purpose and a
plan for Canada. It includes in that plan the
preservation of the unity of this country. And
because we hope to be able to preserve the
unity of this country, we hope at the same
time to continue the Canadian tradition of
making a contribution to the peace of the
world.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Phillips (Rigaud),
debate adjourned.
The Senate adjourned until tomorrow at 3
p.m.

MASS MEDIA
APPOINTMENT OP SPECIAL COMMITTEE

Hon. Koith Davey, with leave of the Senate, moved:
That a Special Commnittee of the Senate
be appointed to consider and report upon
the ownership and control of the major
means of mass public communication in
Canada, in particular, and without
restricting the generality of the foregoing,
to examine and report upon the extent
and nature of their impact and influence
on the Canadian public, to be known as
the Special Committee of the Senate on
Mass Media;
That the committee have power to
engage the services of such counsel and
technical, clerical and other personnel as
may be necessary for the purpose of the
inquiry;
That the committee have power to send
for persons, papers and records, to examine witnesses, to report from time to tirne
and to print such papers and evidence
from day to day as may be ordered by
the conimittee;
That the committee have power to sit
during adjourniments ofthe Senate and
that Rule 76(4) be suspended in relation

He said: I wish to thank honourable senators for giving me leave to present this
motion; also, I wish to make three brief
comments.
First, the namne of the committee has been
changed in a minor way. It is now being
called the Special Senate Commnittee on Mass

SENATE DEBATES
Media rather than Mass Public Communication, as it was known during the last session.
However, I think it fair to say that the Special Senate Committee on Mass Media is the
name that bas been given to the committee
by the press of the country and by senators
on the committee. Therefore, we recommend
for your consideration the adoption of that
name.
Secondly, I hope honourable senators realize that the public hearings of this commîttee
will have a duration of only twelve weeks,
made up of six two-week periods. We have
asked for permission to sit while the Senate is
sitting during only the first two-week period,
naniely, the ýone in December.

the fact that we have reduced the committee

On the Orders of the Day:
Hon. Har±land de M. Maison: Honourable
senators, I should like te, ask the honourable
Acting Leader of the Government (Hon. Mr.
McDonald) a question about what appears to
me in these days of austerity to be quite an
unnecessary expenditure. My question is as
follows:
1. What firms tendered for the job of
replacing most of the very large number
of windows in the centre block of the
Parliament Buildings?
2. Which was the successful tenderer,
and what was the total cost of carrying
out the work?
3. Is the task now finished?
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): How do
you make themn work?
Hon. Mr. Benidickson: Why does the sealer
smell?
Hon A. Hamilton McDonald: Honourable
senators, I should like to defer until a later
date the provision of the information for
which Senator Molson bas asked, except that
I do have the cost figure. The total cost for
the work done on the centre block was some

$80,500.
1 will present the balance of the information requested either tomorrow or next week.

SPEECH FROM THE THEONE
MOTION FOR ADDRESS IN REPLYDEBATE CONTINUED

The Senate resumed from. yesterday, consideration of His Excellency the Governor
General's speech at the opening of the session, and the motion of Hon. Mr. Desruisseaux, seconded by Hon. Mr. Everett, for an
address in reply thereto.
Hon. Lazarus Phillips: Honourable senators,
may I join with those who preceded me in
expressing my highest regard and respect for
the masterful way in which our Speaker
guides our deliberations and keeps us on the
high road of orderly debate.
Ever since I entered this chamber I have
learned to appreciate the great forensic ability of Senator Choquette, and I amn haippy that
when 1 was actively in practice before the
courts hie was in Hull and its environs, and I
in Montreal. I am far from certain that had
we crossed swords for our clients I would
have been happy with the outcome. Senator
Choquette's speech last night will enhance an
already enviable reputation.
My own leader, Senator Martin, was in rare
f orm. He was combative but not pugnacious.
He was persuasive and convincing, and I arn
inclined to believe that as a result I detected
in Senator Choquette some signs of remorse
and contrition for some of his more abrasive
and bitter indictmnents of the present
Governmnent.
Honourable senators, it is with great pleasure that I congratulate Senator Desruisseaux
on his masterful and exhaustive analysis of
the Throne Speech. We are ahl indebted to hlm
for developing certain of the subject matters
dealt with therein. We were also greatly
impressed with the very exciting and
provocative speech of Senator Everett, who
dýeait more particularly with the problems of
the western provinces. Some of his suggestions should receive more careful and detailed
attention in due course in this house. I hope
that we will have this opportunity.
An introduction to a book, honýourable senators, is only of value if it is followed by the
book itself, containing guidance and substance. By the same token, a tasty meal prepared by the chef must be placed before an
appreciative customner with a receptive palate.
This is by way of saying that a Throne
Speech is of value only to the extent that it
charts wbat is to corne, and provided that the
Canadian public to which it, in effect, is
addressed is attuned to the policy of a governiment determined to solve to a degree the

October 29, 1969

SENATE DEBATES

social, political and economie ills that unfortunately are part of our scene today. The
Throne Speech which we heard last week is,
to my mind, unique, in that it does chart the
legislation to come. More importantly, we are
promised a series of white papers dealing
with such important matters as defence, taxation and social security that will enable not
only the two chambers of this Parliament, but
also the public at large, to express their
respective views for the guidance of government in the preparation ultimately of legislation dealing with these superlatively important matters.
The sense of direction manifested by this
Throne Speech, supported by the white
papers to come, gives us reason to believe
that we are fortunate in having an outstanding Prime Minister who is deeply aware of
the problems of the day and who is determined to provide the salutary remedies that
are required. It is too early indeed to state
that we have a national leader of the qualities
of a Chatham, a Gladstone, or a Disraeli, but
the indications to date give us at least cause
of great expectations. I for one, honourable
senators, am particularly pleased by his
recent manifestations of anger and resentment against people in certain quarters, and I
should like to feel that the medical profession
have available what we might call anger pills
so that we may supply our Prime Minister
with the same in order that he may remain in
this mood for some time to come, at least
until the promised measures are taken to rid
the national scene of repetition of some of the
incidents that we, as Canadians, would like to
forget.
In the time at my disposal I propose to deal
with only a few of the subjects referred to in
the Throne Speech, more particularly the
subject matters of defence, economic development and regional disparity. I should say in
passing that the dangers of inflation have
been exhaustively dealt with to date, and the
studies in depth that have been made with
respect to constitutional reform and national
unity do not cal for any particular observations on my part, as they would merely lead
to repetition and redundancy. In any event, it
is hoped that further opportunity will be
given to us in this house to deal with these
important matters, and my views on them
will be dealt with, I hope, in due course in
some detail.
We have been so concerned with the divisive and centrifugal forces that are almost
rending our country apart that we overlook

the paramount importance of having the
necessary armed forces to protect our natural
borders. I am, therefore, of the view that the
matter of North American hemispheric
defence should engage our attention and
study more intensively, and, subject to the
necessary protection of our national sovereignty, we should work in close unity with
our great neighbour to the south in order to
co-ordinate our respective policies, and then
proceed to implement them in such a fashion
that our resources, economic, scientific and
human, are so used that our national defence
policies will have exploited these resources to
the fullest degree and in the most constructive fashion.
Having regard to the necessity of such close
co-operation for defence purposes, I lean more
and more to the view that we should attempt
to develop a plan with the United States of
America, pursuant to which, during a period
of say ten years, we will have established a
complete free trade area between Canada and
the United States. In my opinion, this will be
to the advantage of Canada, although in the
process of reaching such an objective due
regard must be given to the retention of our
complete and absolute sovereignty, and to the
necessity of implementing the necessary economic, political and legislative measures in
such fashion as not to hurt certain segments
of our Canadian economy, which will be
obliged to adjust themselves to the ultimate
new scheme. It seems to me unnatural that in
times of peace our two countries should go
our respective ways, sometimes at cross purposes to each other, and at the same time
expect that we should, God forbid, in the
event of war, have immediately available the
necessary techniques and machinery pursuant
to which we would work under great pressure
in concert with each other.
The majority of people in my Province of
Quebec, more particularly the French-Canadian residents, feel that in the partitioning of
Canada's economic cake, a proper portion has
not been allocated to them. Rivers of ink and
compendious volumes on the subject matter
of constitutional reform and national unity
will be of no value unless there is brought
about some redistribution in the leverage of
economic power so that responsibility and
interest will be associated with the ownership
of property at stake. It is not enough to provide employment in distressed areas, nor do
we assuage the hurt feelings of a great portion of our people by this method. Long-term
credits should be made available for the purpose of enabling those who feel themselves

SENATE DEBATES

dispossessed to acquire an equity stake by
way of share ownership in some of the great
corporate institutions of our country, whether
industrial or financial. This should be and
could be a great cohesive force in overcoming
the present deep resentment. There may be
some difficulty in following this plan with
respect to existing companies, because the
investors might feel that they are being asked
to pay too high a price for such participation.
This objection, however, should not apply
with respect to new corporate entities. My
impression is that such efforts at redistribution could be further identified and developed
in a proposed policy with the United States,
leading to ultimate trade reciprocity, always
keeping in mind the necessity of emphasizing
the importance of revitalizing the economic
life of certain parts of our country, and in
this connection the Maritime Provinces, a
greater part of Quebec and some part of the
Prairie Provinces would be entitled to high
priority considerations.
Some honourable senators may be surprised
that I suggest such drastic action to meet the
present crisis. Have I lost faith in Canada?
Have I lost faith in my own province?
Today's Montreal Gazette carries a Canadian Press dispatch from Chicago referring to a
visit of General Jean-Victor Allard, recently
named Agent-General for Quebec in the United States. In this dispatch, the General is
quoted as urging Canadian companies to send
their personnel for temporary periods to the
United States to gain technological and
managerial experience.
The General stated that he would like to
see Canadians from the St. Lawrence Valley
especially work in the United States so that
they could bring back to Quebec new technological and management skills. The General
further stated that Canadians must make
greater efforts to invest in their own country
while at the same time making sure that they
do not discourage the inflow of capital from
the United States.
In this connection, honourable senators, and
having regard to my suggestion, please keep
in mind that at present 70 per cent of our
exports go to the United States and 75 per
cent of our imports come from there.
General Allard is a spokesman for the present Union Nationale Party in Quebec, which

[Hon. Mr. Phillips.]

October 29, 1969

The serious cleavages evident in my province call for drastic remedies of a non-political nature and should, therefore, receive the
support of Canadians at large. The figures
recently made available to the public, and
only a short while ago referred to by the
Prime Minister, indicate a precipitous economic decline in my province. In dealing with
the subject matter of economic disparity, and
subject to provincial approval, designated
areas requiring support by way of incentives,
as dealt with in the legislation of the last
session, might very well be extended for a
short period to practically our entire province. The issue is grave and affects the
national life of our country and should not be
regarded as a local or parochial problem.
When I was a youth, I lived with the conviction that the twentieth century belonged to
Canada. Alas, such expectation has not been
realized. How disturbing it is to see that
countries such as Japan and Germany, defeated nations of the last war, have outstripped
us in rates of growth, both internal and
external, and with currencies stronger than
that of our own. This situation bas been
brought about by over-emphasis on the difference between the various ethnic, religious and
cultural groups of our country, and also by
over-emphasis of the problem of distribution
of property and wealth, rather than concentrating more on the urgency of productivity
and the necessity of self-restraint so as to put
us in a stronger competitive position.
An article in a recent issue of the
Financial Post reminds us that in the past
year the exports of the West European countries have risen by 27 per cent, those of the
United States by 17 per cent, those of Japan
by 22 per cent and those of Britain-after all
that it went through-by 18 per cent.
Canada's exports are up only 9 per cent. We
should be sufficiently mature and sophisticated to admit that, with the natural resources
with which God has endowed this great country of ours, we have been unequal thus far to
the challenge, because we have exhausted our
energy in bickering and mutual recriminations. One hopes that this sad and even grim
chapter in the post-war history of Canada is
ended and that we can now turn the page to
read happier lines.
We must place ourselves in the very forefront of scientific and technological attainments. In this connection we are reminded of
the outstanding leadership given thus far by
Senator Lamontagne and his committee. His
initial report indicates what we may expect,
and I have no doubt that the leadership taken

October 29, 1969

DEBATES

by this house in appointing this committee
will- have a profound and lasting effect on the
improvement of Canada's industrial development, as well as leading to increased status in
the economic,
cultural and intellectual
spheres. Knowledge that will be so acquired
as a resuit of this study should give a terrifie
impetus to Canada and, when coupled with
the renewal of f aith and confidence, would
enable us to make up for what have been,
alas, lost opportunities.
In my view it is not accidentai that Germany, whîch has re-valued its currency, governs
its national finances with such restraint,
including what is, in effect, a statutory limitation of debt. Such statutory limitation of debt
should, in the main, be related to the gross
national product experience, although it
should not; necessarily be wholly compounded
by this factor. I have, honourable senators, on
previous occasions in our Standing Senate
Committee on National Finance and in considering the Estimates, taken the position that
we should establish a ceiling on national debt.
It is true that the present Government in its
austerity program. is setting a good example,
but 1 think it would be much more helpful if
the executive branch of government were
bound by Parliament's restrictions which
would be set, of course, from time to time.
The necessary fiexibility would have to be
provided to cover national emergencies, such
as war or grave national crises.
I know that I belong to a minority in the
expression of these views, but nevertheless I
ami frankly taking advantage of this forum to
express them again, in the hope that they will
receive more attention than has been given to
thern thus far.
One of the most satisfactory aspects of the
Throne Speech is the indication of the white
papers that will be brought down and to
which I have already alluded. This indicates
the desire of the Government to take Parlianment and the public into its confidence and to
ask for their consîdered views before final
legislation is brought down on any particular
subject. I think that for the first time i the
history of the Senate when our Standing Senate Comrnittee on National Finance reported
on the Estimates last session, its report included. the recommendation that no major tax
legislation be introduced with immediate
effect, without giving Parliament and the
public the opportunity of being heard beforehand. I arn glad to say that the White Paper
that will deal with the subi ect matter of taxation will give us ail an opportunity of expressing our views on this very important
matter.

The White Paper on the subject of social
security is being awaited with keen interest.
It is here that we should surely see the thinking of our Prime Minister in his effort to
develop the just society. There seems to be a
consensus in Canada that our cradle to the

revamped. I for one hope that, without in any
way minimizing the importance of protectlng
the dignity of the individual, of providing
proper housing and of protecting the health
of the Canadian, there will nevertheless be
re-introduced, somewhat more effectively, the
element of compensation for effort and even
the re-introduction of minimal punitive
aspects in ternis of lesser economic benefits
for those Canadians who simply refuse to
give of their best in enabling Canada to reach
its high goals. There is some feeling that our
permissive society has led us into some blind
alleys and that we must make every effort to
return to the high road of achievement.
Senator Croil in a remarkably able
speech-for which I arn sure we should al
congratulate him-on the subject matter of
the poverty inquiry which he is heading,
yesterday closed his remarks in this charnber by referring to the 1929-1949 period,
and he used the challenging expression that
we have been wandering for 40 years i the
wllderness but that he now sees evidence of
the Promised Land. Unfortunately, some of
our fellow-Canadians, farnuliar with the Bible,
remember that the Lord provided manna
every morning without the eaters being
obliged to, work.
To balance Senator Croll's observation in
that respect-and I amn sure Senator Croil will
forgive me because of our common originmay I also refer ta the Holy Text? May I say
that earlier in that Holy Text there is a
reminder about being obliged to work for six
days and resting only on the seventh.
In any event, we shouid not forget that the
Promised Land was only attained by blood,
sweat, tears and hard work, and when it
came to the necessity of reaching the Promised
Land, the ideallsts like Moses had ta give way
to fighting men like Joshua before they
attained their goal.
In ail this I amn only emphasizing again that;
it is essential that we keep i mind the good
old virtues and do not forget the necessity of
continuous productivity in ail aspects of aur
life.
As a lawyer, I arn delighted to note that
there will be a bill ta create a law reform,

administration at the federal levels. In the
light of what has recently happened on our
streets and elsewhere, need I say more on the
desirability of this great reform being enacted
as quickly as possible.
The proposed granting of the electoral franchise to persons who have reached 18 years of
age is one that meets with my approval. In
ancient times, some 2,000 years ago and more,
the then rabbis, in dividing the ages of man,
spoke of 18 years of age as the age of marriage; and at that age a person, male or
female, had reached that degree of maturity
which qualified him or her for that exciting
experiment. In so expressing approval, I am
sure we all hope that when this new generation is brought into the electoral mainstream
it will learn to appreciate, possibly more than
it does now, the value that should be given to
the judgment and experience of those who
are older than they.
The history of mankind is replete with
proof that progress is made by gradual evolution and adjustment of institutions to the current needs of the day. The world today and
its institutions represent, in a sense, the
residual experience of past generations,
although admittedly some of them obviously
call for change, reform and renovation. The
revolutionary process is repugnant to those of
us in the western tradition and in the western world who have been reared in the democratic tradition and the paramountcy of Parliament. We hope that the extension of the
franchise will bring about a partnership of
youth and its idealism with their elders and
their more sedate judgment. The experience
of the Roman Empire, which after all lasted
for century upon century, gives us cause to
appreciate the warning of its literature that
we should, in the revamping of our institutions, hasten slowly-Festina Lente is the
message of Rome to us.
To me the most inspirational paragraph in
the entire Throne Speech is the following:
Our aim is a strong and productive country soundly equipped to face the future;
but we are equally concerned with the

schedules comparing the gross national product of our country in prior years and by
way of comparison with other countries.
Unfortunately, part of our gross national product is indeed gross and vulgar and we need
not be proud of it. I think that we should pay
a little more attention to the dignity of man
and to his inherent decency, if given the
chance, and that is why I am impressed by
the reference in the Speech from the Throne
which I have just quoted. Last year, in speaking before you, honourable senators, I stated
that no legislative and executive remedies
would cure Canada's ills unless we learned to
respect each other more and make allowances
for each other's faults and frailties.
Let us, therefore, fellow Canadians-and I
use this forum for this message-attempt to
set aside our small and narrow prejudices.
Let us raise our sights. Although we keep our
feet on the ground in terms of realism and
stability, let us also realize that God gifted us
with eyes with which we can look to Heaven.
It is only then that we will all be inspired by
the desire to work together and achieve
Canada's national destiny which surely
Divine Providence had in mind for us. Let us
turn the page to the Book of Ecclesiastes,
which says: There is a time to weep and
there is a time to laugh. Honourable senators
and fellow Canadians, let us close the period
of weeping and let us work together in such
fashion as to justify the hope that around the
corner there should be a time for joy and
laughter.

this early In a session of Parliament. I do not to Canada, despite some of the figures that

SENATE DEBATES
appear in this report, upon which I will comment later. I do not question the validity of
the figures, but I think you will agree with
me that, as far as Canada's role in international development is concerned, such figures
could be most misleading.
The report indicates something of the magnitude of the problem that faces the world in
which we live, and I hope that no one in this
chamber, at least, will regard this as a problem only of other people. It is a Canadian
problem. If this report means anything, it
makes it clear that it is a problem of the
developed nations every bit as much as it is a
problem of the developing nations.
Some of the Canadian delegates who were
in Trinidad at the C.P.A. meetings and others
who have been abroad have made it clear to
me that two-thirds of the people of the world
are becoming very impatient. There are many
reasons why this is more so today than during other periods. They know how well the
rest of us are living. They would not be at all
impressed with the magnitude of the problems
facing Canada, about which we have heard so
much since this session began. What we call
problems, to them would be almost desiderata
of living. What we call poverty, to most of
the people in the world would be affluence.
I say the evidence is that they are getting
impatient. When I say it is a Canadian problem, I say it because history does repeat itself,
and there were other "have" nations in other
periods of time who felt every bit as secure
as we may tend to feel now in respect to the
"have-not" nations.
I am speaking of two-thirds of the people of
the world, or 66 per cent of the population.
Their total share of world GNP at the
moment is about 12.5 per cent. The rest of
us-the other third-enjoy the remaining 87.5
per cent.
In many nations of the world today the per
capita income is less than $100, in comparative
terms. This applies to such nations as India,
Pakistan, Indonesia, and Nigeria. The "rich"
nations among the developing nations have a
per capita income of from $400 to $500. These
are the well-to-do nations at the top of the
hundred, such as Mexico, Chile, Venezuela,
Greece and others.
Is there any hope? Mr. Pearson's report
makes it clear that we have not done all that
we hoped to do in the twenty years during
which donor nations have assumed some
responsibility in this area, but it does hold
out hope for the future if we respond to the
[Hon. Mr. Grosart.]

October 29, 1969

challenges, and if we become sufficiently concerned with this problem to do all that the
report suggests must be done.
It is often said that it is not all a question
of help from the developed countries to the
developing countries. They have to do their
share. The report again makes it clear that
there are many deficiencies on the side of the
developing nations as well as on the side of
the developed nations. But, on the other hand,
the developing nations are making a valiant
effort. Ranging over the whole one hundred
nations we find, for example, that 85 per cent
of the new investment in the last few years in
these nations was financed out of domestic
savings. We find that they have actually outstripped us in the annual increase in the production of electric energy. Their annual
increase averaged 10.5 per cent in the period
from 1948 to 1967, as against our 7.7 per cent.
Honourable senators will realize, of course,
that they started a long way back, but the
evidence is that they are trying. On the other
hand, they have one physician, on the average, for every three or four thousand people.
Their export earnings, which are the life
blood of development in these countries, have
not been increasing at anything like the rate
in the developed countries, which means that
the gap between us continues to widen.
Between 1950 and 1968 their share of world
exports actually dropped from 30 per cent to
20 per cent. It is true that they have maintained about the same rate of growth in absolute terms as the developed nations. However,
at least half of this has been completely nullified by population growth.
The figures are interesting-I will give
them first for the developing nations, and
then for the developed nations. The total per
capita production of the developing countries
increased by 5.0 per cent annually, while that
of the developed countries increased by 4.8
per cent annually. On the other hand, the
population increase in the developing countries was 2.5 per cent, leaving them with a
net increase of 2.5 per cent, against a net
increase of 3.6 per cent in productivity per
head over this period in the developed
countries.
Nobody knows how great the problem of
unemployment is in these developing nations.
There are many reasons for that. Statisties
are difficult to obtain, and definitions of
"unemployment" differ from country to country. The International Labour Organizationwhich, incidentally, is meeting in Ottawa this

October 29, 1969

Octobr 29,1969SENATE
DEBATES

week while celebrating its fiftieth anniversary-is conducting a very widespread survey, and it is hoped that this will provide
some figures on the true magnitude of unemployment. Certainly those figures wiil indicate
that by oui standards it is at leat an average
of 20 per cent throughout the developing
nations of the world.
Honourable senators, that is a brief outline
of some of the aspects of the problem. The
report makes some very positive recommendations. It seems to me that they are ahnost
minimal recommendiations, because my own
expectation was that they would be much
more drastic. The main recommendation is
that the developed nations should increase
their development aid to the level of one per
cent of gross national product by 1975. Tihis
target has been talked about for a long time.
It was set by the United Nations Trade and
Development Conference, and is again endorsed in t-his report.
The report also recommends that 70 per
cent of the aid from the donor nations should
be from officiai sources. This is very important s0 far as Canada is concerned because
our percentage of "officiai" to total aid is
already very high. The report makes some
very broad recommendations as to what the
nature of the aid should be. It recommends
the progressive untylng of aid. Honourable
senators are aware of the significance of that.
Tied aid is aid which transfers resources, but
flot money. It transfers the resources of one
country to another, and therefore the purchases are tied to the economy of the donor
country. It has many disadvantages, and it
considerably lowers the actual net value of
the aid given.
The report also recommends that the percentage of multilateral aid in the total aid of
the donor nations be increased from the present level of 10 per cent to 20 per cent. This
refers, of course, to the aid which goes
through such agencies as the United Nations,
the World Bank, the International Finance
Corporation, and other international bodies.
The report deals, of course, also with trade.
When I listened to the Speech from the
Throne I had at the back of my mind some of
the recommendations that were made in the
matter o! trade by the Pearson Commission.
With your permission I would place them on
the record in sumnnary; I wifl not read them
in toto. I thought how different the Speech
from the Throne would have been and how
different its impact around the world if some
or ail of these reconimendations had been
included. The Leader o! the Government

might not; have had to apologize for it as
merely a "philosophic" document which had
to be given substance by two annexes the
next day, one of them a duil echo of the past
and the other a sort of pious hope for the
future. Instead of the "philosophy" we were
given, we might have been told that Canada
was going to start on something concrete,
such as these recommendations of the Pearson Commission. Some of these may startle
honourable senators. Substituting "Canada"
for "developed countries" in the report, some
o! them would read: Ca'nada should eliminate
as soon as possible excise and import; duties
on non-competing products of special interest
to the developing countries.
Canada should draw up plans in respect of
protected commodities designed to ensure
that in time an increasing share of domestic
consumption is supplied by imnports from,
developing countries.
Canada should be financing buffer stocks i
support of commodity agreements.
Canada should have no new quantitative
restrictions on products of special interest to
developing countries. This is said in spite of
the fact that every now and then during the
last session we saw, and no doubt throughout
this session we will see, hidden away in
Orders in Council quantitative restrictions on
imports from developiag nations.
Canada should establish a generalized nonreciprocal scheme of preferences for manufactured and semi-manufactured goods.
The I.M.F. should study a clearing arrangement for the financing of trade, and Canada
should provide financial assistance directly
and to Regional Development Banks.
One wonders if any developed country La
going to, pay any real attention to such
recommendations. Are we prepared, really, te,
open oui own markets in order to help these
countries?
I said that the Pearson reconimendations
are minimal, surprisingly low, and even these
suggestions to my mmnd corne under that
heading.
I said that the report is not altogether fair
to Canada, if read as it stands. For example:
at page 148 we find a table showing the official development assistance of various selected countries as a percentage o! G.N.P. Iii
it Cana-da is shown as contributmng .28 per cent
in 1968. This puts us below Austria, Belgiuni, France, Gerxnany, Japan, The Netherlands, Norway, the U.K., the U.S. and manyother countries.
I arn glad to say that the table, if it were a
little more explicit, would show the Canadian.

SENATE DEBATES
commitment this year as .55 per cent. The
figures in the report are actual flow figures
rather than commitments made, and in
Canada's present position there is a vast difference. Fortunately, the amounts committed
by Parliament for development aid do not
end with the current fiscal year but are carried forward. So there is no question whatsoever that in the years ahead Canada's position will be shown as greatly improved. The
.28 figure is not incorrect as far as it goes, but
it is not a realistic indication of the Canadian
effort.
Again, at page 150, the flow of development
assistance from Canada is shown as $175 million. Actually, we appropriated $280 million,
which will be spent. Honourable senators
might ask why the lag between the two. It is
rather unusual for any government department to fall that far behind in spending money
appropriated. There is a very good reason:
that within the last two years, particularly
under Mr. Maurice Strong, the present director of CIDA, Canada has been making a very
careful analysis of the quality of its aid. We
were one of the countries which very quickly
came to appreciate the fact that there was a
tremendous amount of waste in international
aid. It is understandable; we were learning
with other countries. Like them, Canada made
many mistakes. Many of these mistakes are
detailed in the report. We have deliberately
held up on the spending of this money until
we are sure that there are objectives to which
we could respond, knowing that we were
truly contributing to the development of the
recipient nations. This is one reason why the
name of the office which handles this important part of Canadian policy was changed
from the External Aid Office to the Canadian
International Development Agency in order to
stress Canada's insistence that money we
spend abroad as official development assistance be used for the development of those
nations.
I said that in some aspects the report is
pessimistic about the past, but it is optimistic
about the future. I will not take the time now
to detail some of the very interesting statistics in this report. I will summarize, if I may,
by saying that the report gives a very definite
affirmative answer to the question as to
whether there is any hope. The report says
yes-not tomorrow, or the next day, but
based on the development experience of the
past 20 years, if the developing nations will
meet this modest target of one per cent of the
G.N.P. by 1975, with 70 per cent as official
aid, most of these countries, certainly by the
[Hon. Mr. Grosart.]

October 29, 1969

end of the century, will have passed the takeoff point at which their own economic development can carry on under its own steam. I
recommend to honourable senators the proof
of that statement which is so well documented in this report. Incidentally, the 18.9 per
cent shown at page 150 as the annual increase
in Canadian official aid required to meet the
1975 target is really only about 8 per cent on
the basis of current commitment.
One of the great numerical deficiencies in
our Canadian aid to other countries is in the
private sector. We are certainly one of the
lowest of all the major countries in our private sector investment in developing nations.
There are many reasons for that. There are
also some reasons to believe that some process of correction will take place within the
next few years. Some hope is being placed, I
know, by our officials on the Export Development Corporation Act, which in part was
designed specifically to facilitate the flow of
investment money from the Canadian private
sector to developing countries. There are also
some very large plans now in hand by some
of our major companies for what in the terminology of this business are called lump
investments, which should considerably raise
the private sector percentage of our total aid.
Honourable senators, I have dealt at considerable length with this international problem
within the context of our domestic problems.
I conclude by repeating the statement I made
earlier from Mr. Pearson's report, that the
war against poverty and deprivation begins at
home, but it cannot and must not end there.
Hon. Mary E. Kinnear: Honourable senators, speaking in the debate on the address in
reply to the Speech from the Throne, I wish
to pay my respect to Mr. Speaker, the Honourable Jean-Paul Deschatelets; the Leader of
the Government in the Senate, the Honourable Paul Martin, whom I wish to congratulate
most heartily for his kindness and thoughtfulness to us all, and for the efficient manner in
which he conducts the aff airs of the Senate;
also the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, the Honourable Jacques Flynn, the Acting Leader of the Opposition in the Senate,
the Honourable Lionel Choquette, and the
Deputy Leader of the Government in the
Senate, the Honourable Leopold Langlois. I
should also like to congratulate the mover of
this motion, the honourable Senator Desruisseaux, my seatmate, and the seconder, the
honourable Senator Everett. I would also congratulate those who have spoken today, Senators Phillips (Rigaud) and Grosart, both illustrious speakers.

Today I wish to try to elaborate on one of
the major problems facing Canada, namely,
pollution. For that matter, this probiemi faces
the nations of the world. So much has been
written about pollution that today it is a topie
in every household. Canadians are becoming
aware of the danger from impure water and
agricultural produets that have been sprayed
by harmful insecticides and pesticides.
Driving along our highways we see a sorry
amount of pollution, such as the periodic
burning of huge piles of rubber tires giving
off long columns of very heavy, black, oily
smoke. Many ships are doing the saine thing.
0f course, everyone has seen the heavy smog
that hangs over our large cities. Another vexing question is that the air is poiluted by
fali-out from. nuclear blasts, and we must be
sure that the fail-out is at a safe level. One
thing we can be thankful for is that the waste
from atomic energy is stored in safe
receptacles.
In some areas industries make a valiant,
start at cleaning up their effluence but fail to
continue because of expense. Be that as it
may, we must find ways of cieaning Up the
air, either by shared costs, internationally,
nationaily, provincially or municipally, or by
the other most reliable source, the citizens of
Canada through the taxation structure.
There is another source of pollution that is
put into the soil by harmful insecticides and
pesticides. Recently DDT bas been removed
from. the market. I asked a scientist about the
amount of lead and mercury in vegetables.
The answer was vague, as hie acknowledged
that there was some and that they know
about how much a human body can stand.
However, hie did not wish to elaborate, but I
think now is the right time to put a stop to
excess in spray damage. The residue of certain sprays remains in vegetables, fruit and
other agricultural products, and we the consumer eat these products, and harmiui residue remains in our systems.
The proposed Canada Water Act speaks of
water quality. This is most important, as we
do not wish to use water that is at the borderline of iimpurities fit for using. On the
contrary, we need an excellent water quality
that is pure enough for drînking from a well.
Ail wells do not; have pure water, and 1 mean
wefls that are used by summner residents
along our lakes and rivers. I have feared that
wells are not tested often enough, and many
of them are too close to sewage. It is established that much contamination comes from
untreated sewage from summer resorts where
sewage drains into our lakes and rivers. If

you use a small plane and fiy at a low altitude over the Great Lakes area you will have
no trouble seeing the sources of pollution.
You will see drainage i various colours
entering the lakes. This can be traced to
municipal sewage, industrial waste and, as I
mentioned before, drainage from summer
resorts.
Despite the national urgency of this problem, an article in the October 1969 issue of
Monetary Times says in its opening
paragraph:
No one wants to admit it publicly, but it
may be as long as a decade before the
new Canada
Water Act is fully
operational.
In my own view, by that time we will be
hopelessly engulfed in pollution, if it
increases at the rate of the past decade. It is
more llkely to increase at a faster rate.
The other side of the picture is that the

We need more sewage treatinent stations.
Here is another quote froen the Monetary
Times of October 1969:

I would like to place on the record a quotation from the Weiland Evening Tribune of
September 26, 1969. This is a report of an
address given in the Welland area:

The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators,
I call your attention to the presence in the

and a former senator; indeed, he was not only
a very popular colleague of ours but one
whose contributions to the Upper House, to
Parliament and to the country have been outstanding. I refer to the Honourable Norman

REVISED STATUTES OF CANADA
PUBLICATION

Hon. John M. Macdonald: Honourable
senators, I should like to ask the honourable
Leader of the Government if he can give an
indication of when the work of the revising
and the printing of the Statutes of Canada
will be completed.
Hon. Mr. Martin: Honourable senators, I
have been advised by the Department of Justice that due to unavoidable and unforeseen
printing difficulties, the revision of the Statutes will not be available until June of next
year.

The Senate resumed from yesterday consideration of His Excellency the Governor
General's speech at the opening of the session, and the motion of Hon. Mr. Desruisseaux, seconded by Hon. Mr. Everett, for an
address in reply thereto.
Hon. Richard J. Stanbury: Honourable
senators, may I begin by adding to those of
other honourable senators my personal congratulations to Senator Desruisseaux and
Senator Everett on the excellence of their
carefully prepared addresses accompanying
their proposing and seconding, respectively,
the motion for an address in reply to the
Speech from the Throne.
The speech which His Excellency the Governor General read on the occasion of the
opening of this session of Parliament, as I
listened to it, and then read and re-read it,
impressed me on several counts. First, the
beauty of the ceremony and the formality of
the words led me to a contemplation of the
great traditions of Canada-the heritage of
two peoples, joined by a multitude of others,
to live together in widely separated communities loosely tied together by Confederation,
the two beautiful languages in which the
speech was expressed, and the pioneering
spirit which challenged simple people from
all over the world to cone, with the great
qualities of faith and fortitude, to make a
new life for themselves and their families.
Secondly, I thought of the great effort on
the part of the Public Service and the ministers of the cabinet and their staffs, in preparing not only a comprehensive program for
our consideration, but in being able actually
to lay before Parliament 71 items ready for
our scrutiny-the first time that such a feat
has been accomplished in Canadian history.
Then I was intrigued by the fact that
extensive reviews had been undertaken in
external affairs, defence, tax reforms, citizenship, social security, information, postal service, and that these would be submitted for
public debate in preparation for the drafting
of definitive legislation affecting almost every
one of the institutions of government in
Canada. It reminded me of the admiration
with which representatives of Scandinavian
countries whom I met this summer talked
about the apparent ability of the Canadian
society to review and renew its institutions,
as opposed to what they felt was their own

October 30. 1969

Ociobr 20,1969SENATE
DEBATES

inability to do more than add new regulations
on top of the old.
It occurred to me that we as Canadians had
been well served by successive governments.,
However, gradually we had corne to depend
more and more upon government to do the
constructive things in society. Therefore, we
depend less and less upon our own individual
and collective initiative to develop healthy
relationships among us, to create a climate of
understanding between our people and our
Government, to preserve the heritage of our
natural wealth. This is also true of our
response to the needs of those billions of
people in other parts of the world to whom
the domestic problems of Canada seem as
infinitesimal as their own probability of living
past the age of 34 years.
The Governinent plans to reduce regional
disparities. It attempts to legislate as to language and other civil rights. It tries to assert
the equality of Indians and Eskimos wîth
other Canadians. It tries to develop the
machinery for co-operation between labour
and management for the welf are of the
nation. True, tis is the role of governmnentto legisiate, to make formal arrangements, to
preserve rights, to urge co-operation. But the
best legislation in the world, the best governmental efforts in the world, can neyer succeed
in building an harmonious and dynamic
society unless the things that government can
do-the bare skeleton of the body politic-are
fieshed out by the desire and determination of
the private citizen and that desire is confirmed and strengthened by practical initiatives by individuals and groups of private
citizens.
What are we as citizens doing to, reinforce
the Government's efforts to develop an understanding among the different groups who
form the Canadian mosaic? Apart from the
magnificent efforts of the Canadian Council
of Obristians and Jews to exchange students
across the country, there is no society, no
foundation, no association that has accepted
the responsibîlity of creating the dialogue
without which the Canadian people can neyer
begin to understand the attitudes and problems of each other. What private agency is
dedicated to developing the real people-topeople understanding between French and
English? What wealthy Canadian has formed
a foundation to bring Indians and Eskimos
dloser to their fellow Canadians and to, let
those fellow Canadians see and understand
the degradation of body and spirit which. has
been their lot? Where is the initiative from

big labour and big business to bring themselves together to develop, as has been done
in West Germany, a formula for the dynamic
growth of the economy, beneflting not only
themselves but the littie people as well?
Dialogue is the only answer to the regionalism and split personality of Canada. Dialogue
is the only way in which Canadians can begin
to understand each other and begin to develop a common conscious-ness of nation. But
dialogue among the federal and provincial
governments is not enough; and government
cannot legislate dialogue. Dialogue must be
the wish of the people, and there must be
private individuals and agencies prepared to
accept the challenge and facilitate the fulfil]ment of that wish.
In his address His Excellency said in part 1:
A dlsturbing element in many countries of the world has been the rising tide
of unrest, particularly among young
people. It has expressed itself in many
ways, in public debate, in peaceful protest and sometimes in violence. Our profound disapproval of the excesses must
not blind us to deeply felt and legitimate
aspirations. Many citizens in our own
country believe that they are entitled to
assume greater responsibility for the destiny of our society. Such demands insofar
as they do not conflict with the general
welfare, are the expression of a truly
democratic ideal. They must be satisfied
if our society is to attain its goals of
peace and justice.
Does any honourable senator believe that
this ideal is going to be reached, or even
approached, simply by legislation lowering
the voting age to 18, or indeed by any legislative measure?
0f course not. It is going to, take the combined efforts of ahl politîcal parties, all of the
media, and of a great many private citizens to
bring this to, pass. The political parties must
become the vehicles through which the problems and attitudes of each community across
the land are carried to the people who have
responsibllity
for
governmnent;
vehicles
through which the plans and actions of government are explained and tested and modified by the people in the conununities. Nothing short of that kind of effort is going to
bring the people into s0 close a relationshlp
with governmnent as to stem that rising tide of
unrest that inevitably resuits in increasing
violence. But no party can accomplish that
task, even if it is the government party. The
people must have a choice of vehicles, s0 the

SENATE DEBATES
burden lies upon all parties equally. For that
reason and because the purpose is essentially
non-partisan and altruistic in nature, because
its aim is to raise the general level of political
understanding and trust between the people
and their government, I call upon al political
parties in Canada to work together to develop
the techniques of participation. I call upon all
of the media of Canada to support and
promote a brave experiment in democracy
which may, at some time in the future, turn
out to have been the crucial effort in stemming that rising tide of unrest.
And in case some of you are saying to
yourselves, "But the job of a political party is
to get members elected and then, if successful, help to dispense the patronage," I assure
you that that is no longer and can no longer
be the purpose of a political party in Canada.
Of course it has a job at election time; but it
has a more vital role every day of the year,
on behalf of every man, woman, and child, to
equip the Members of Parliament, whether in
Government or in Opposition, with the attitudes and judgments of the democratic forces
of the country, and to develop in the people a
feeling of confidence and trust in their political institutions.
At another point in the Speech from the
Throne, His Excellency said:
Our resources are immense, but they
are not inexhaustible. Although we must
encourage their development, we must
also conserve them and regulate their
use . .the Government will introduce
legislation which will enable it, in co-operation with the provinces, to improve
and preserve our water resources. Thus
may we assure ourselves of their continuing benefit for our own domestic use,
industrial expansion and recreation.
With all due respect to His Excellency, legislation cannot alone assure the abolition of the
shameful evidences of pollution he has
mentioned:
befouled water, despoiled beaches, rotting
marine
vegetation,
and
diminished
fishing.
Fortunately in this area private groups are
springing up all across the country whose
purpose it is to inform the public about the
terrible toll that pollution has already exacted
upon our society and to alert them as to the
danger which is lurking on the horizon. But
where are the service clubs who have the
manpower and resources to carry out a massive campaign in every community to make
[Hon. Mr. Stanbury.]

October 30, 1969

people conscious of what they are doing
individually to create pollution, to make them
conscious of what their employers are doing
to pollute their environment, to make them
realize that their municipal and provincial
and federal governments are frequently the
worst offenders-and having done that, then
to bring all that knowledge and understanding to bear, not just to obtain effective legislation-although effective legislation would be
obtained more quickly with this kind of
effort-but to put into the mind of every
citizen a consciousness of the sources of pollution and what he himself can do about
destroying those sources?
His Excellency further said:
In addition to our work in international
organizations, we are intensifying our
direct contacts with many of the governments and peoples of Latin America,
Africa and Asia. At this session, you will
be asked to consider a bill to create a
Development
International
Canadian
Research Centre which will bring together Canadian and foreign experts on the
problems of developing economies.
Now, this is a magnificent initiative on the
part of the Government towards playing a
truly effective role in assisting developing
nations.
I have just come back from Germany,
where I participated in a seminar of representatives of 45 countries, at which it was agreed
that first priority in aid from the developed
countries to the developing countries must be
given to the conveying of technical skill,
knowledge and the development of middle
management personnel. I found that Canada
is highly respected for the care with which it
works with the governments of developing
countries, to determine the programs which
will be most helpful to the people of those
countries. I agree with the Right Honourable
Lester B. Pearson's report to the World Bank,
which had serious implications for Canada in
calling for the tripling of the resources we
now devote to aid. I realize we are in a period
of austerity and it is difficult to justify the
tripling of any budget item. But let me assure
you that while we live in the sure knowledge
that our austerity will end some day, the
people for whose benefit our aid programs are
planned live in the certain knowledge that
their austerity will deepen from day to day.
The key phrase in what I have just said is:
"It is hard to justify." Recently when speaking to a group of people, one woman in the

October 30, 1969

SENATE DEBATES

group asked this question: "With all the cutbacks that the Government is making, how
can it justify sending those hundreds of millions of dollars to people in other countries?"
A recent poll showed that two-thirds of the
Canadian people believe that aid to other
countries should be cut back. While I know
that it is not necessary to explain to honourable senators the reason why we must continue
and increase our aid programs, my point is
that no one is explaining to the Canadian
people how vital these programs are, not only
to the people who benefit directly from them,
but to our own continued existence.
The same attitudes in roughly the same
proportions are found among the people of
the United States. I asked the American
representative at the seminar what he felt to
be the cause of the serious lack of understanding by the North American peoples of the
needs of the peoples of the developing countries and our responsibility to do something
about it. His explanation was one which I felt
was equally valid in Canada. He said that in
a democratie society the government as a
matter of policy does not blow its own horn
or develop propaganda about its programs. In
general, domestic programs are visible to the
people because they affect their daily lives;
but foreign aid programs are not visible and
they assume no relevance for the man who is
fully engrossed in his working and family
life. The answer therefore lies with private
agencies which will take the responsibility of
bringing these needs forcefully to the attention of the Canadian people and imposing
upon them the responsibility to do their part.
In this area we have a number of excellent
private groups-CUSO, the Canadian University Services Overseas, is an outstanding
example of an organization which, with the
assistance of the Canadian Government, has
made a tremendous contribution in developing countries. But who knows about it? Who
knows where our CUSO people are and what
they are doing?
We have the United Nations organizations,
we have the Canadian Save the Children
Fund, we have church relief funds, all sorts
of excellent efforts being carried out by small
groups helping in large ways, but there is no
private agency taking the responsibility for
explaining what Canadian dollars, whether
tax or voluntary, are doing, why they are
needed and what must be accomplished. There
is no one "justifying" in the minds of the
Canadian people the expenditures already
being made and those vastly larger expenditures which must be made in the near future.

The last, but perhaps most urgent, area
with which I want to deal is inflation. The
Government has made no bones about what,
needs to be done and what it is prepared to
do to stop inflation-to save the old and
unprotected from the evaporation of their
savings and their fixed incomes. No government can by itself stop inflation. The people,
with the leadership of government, will stop
inflation when management people, labour
people, storekeepers, consumers, realize its
dangers-when the ordinary man says, "I
won't buy that just now"; when labour says,
"Now is no time for big demands"; when
capital says, "Now is the time to absorb some
rising costs to give the economy a chance to
level off." It is in the interest of each group to
take this attitude and it will be only when
they do so that our fight-not the Government's fight: our fight-to stop inflation will
be won.
In summary, let me say that I have the
greatest admiration for the Prime Minister
and for the cabinet, which has worked not
only hard but methodically to pinpoint the
problems of our nation; to review the nature
of our institutions; to draw, from a broad
spectrum, ideas about the solutions for our
problems and the renovation of our institutions; and to have ready in practical form so
much proposed legislation. But legislation can
only be the framework upon which to build a
society.
The people themselves must want to build.
They must want to live together. They must
want to work together. They must want to
serve together. There must be wealthy
individuals who see the broad view and are
prepared to devote their wealth to foundations whose objects are the fulfliknent of that
view. There must be groups of individuals
who see a need and fill it. Service clubs,
management and labour, political parties-all
organizations, whose interest is the public
weal, can, by defining their objectives and
co-ordinating their efforts and with constructive help from the media, give the leadership
which will bring people, who now live in
regional enclaves, distrusting their political
institutions, lacking a consciousness of any
common bonds, and unwilling to accept their
responsibilities to humanity, to recognition
that their destiny lies in their own hands,
that they can make this country what they
want to make it, and that the Government of
Canada, this Government, is bending herculean efforts to remove the causes of past
frustrations, to open the doors of Canadian
society, to let the Canadian people themselves

SENATE DEBATES
build the kind of society of which they will
be proud and in which they will find personal
satisfaction.

October 30, 1969

Honourable senators, I think we can guess
who wrote that particular paragraph, a paragraph which in my opinion, and I am sure in
the judgement of many others in this country,
placed the representative of Her Majesty in
the humiliating position of being little but a
messenger for the Cabinet. Honourable senators, if the present Government of Canada
wishes to get rid of the Monarchy, and it may
well be that some among us would support
them, then surely their honourable course is
to say so with manliness and courage, not to
try to do it by a process of attrition in a
furtive way, and not by "being willing to
wound, but afraid to strike."
And what matters were laid before us in
the words of the Governor General? Honourable senators, having watched and taken
some part in politics for more than half a
century, I know that for our tormented world
there are no infallible solutions. But, honourable senators, this document does not even
attempt to offer solutions. What it offers instead is a mish-mash of platitudes, as I have
said, thin, intangible, unsubstantial.
For 18 months now we have had it dinned
into us that this swinging governnent, given
time, would burst forth with pie in the sky
for everybody. They have been up to their
ears, as I have said, in charts and graphs and
what have you, and members of the Cabinet
must have worn out their shoes, if not their
sandals, tracking between the East Block and
the microphones of the National Press Club,
but nothing ever comes of it. The stage props
are all there; the CBC orchestra is in the pit
playing like mad and the starry-eyed young
reporters keep telling us morning after morning how the Government is going to get
tough. But, as I said, the curtain does not go
up. We are always to be but never blessed.
And certainly no honourable senator can say
that there is blessing in this Speech from the
Throne. Certainly there is no blessing in this
speech for the more than 4 per cent of our
people who are out of work, and in some
areas up to 10 per cent.
I am looking now at the Leader of the
Government in the Senate. How well I
remember in the days gone by when another
ministry of another political stripe was in
office, how he would rise in the Commons day
after day and ask in a voice trembling with
solicitude, what on earth did the government
intend to do about the unemployed. I don't
see him rising now to ask this question.

Hon. M. Graitan O'Leary: Honourable
senators, I feel I must join humbly with those
who have preceded me in congratulating the
mover and seconder of the address. I have
been in this house now for seven sessions,
and I can say quite truthfully that these two
speeches were the finest that I have heard on
such an occasion.
I want also to extend my sincere condolences to the Leader of the Government and
the Leader of the Opposition for the sorrow
which came to thern this week. And to you,
Your Honour, I express my gratification at
seeing your complete recovery from the
illness that afflicted you some time ago, and
to see you back in your Chair, directing with
your gentle wisdom the proceedings of this
chamber and keeping them in a civilized
state.
And now I come to my assignment, which
is to discuss the Speech from the Throne. I
am afraid that I will speak, as I always do,
with a sort of Celtic vehemence, but I would
like to ask honourable senators to believe that
in what I am going to say I am not speaking
with rancor; for that sort of thing, I have no
talent at all.
I must say in all honesty that, as I read the
Speech from the Throne, it can only be
described as a mishmash of platitudes-a
thin, intangible, unsubstantial vapour. And
this sort of thing-the noble affirmations
which we read in the speech-this sort of
thing has been going on now for some 18
months.
The East Block swarms with technocrats,
the ministers are up to their ears in paper,
in charts, in statistical systems, in cost-accounting systems, and information processing
systems, but nothing ever happens. They call
this a Speech from the Throne! Honourable
senators, through a hundred years the
representative of the Crown, the King or

DEBATES

Hon. Mr. O'Leary: What blessing is there in
this speech for the 20 per cent of our people
who, according to the Economic Council, are
living in a state of poverty? What blessing
is there for the aged among our people? What
blessing for the underprivileged? What blessing for the many suffering misery grievously
from the ravages of inflation? There is certainly no biessing for western farmers who
face ruin because they cannot seil their
wheat. Ail the blessings these people I have
mentioned get is a promise that the Government will see to it that their telephcmes are
flot going to be tapped. This is what this
speech amounts to. Honourable senators, the
social and spiritual health of this nation just
cannot be deterrnined in that way.
This is not a program; this is a yawn; this
is a confession of impotence by the government of the day, that it cannot do its job.
Now, Sir, having disposed of the Throne
Speech-because an intelligent discussion of
something must have an intelligible content
and there is no intelligible content in this
speech, 1 arn going to talk briefly about something I have wanted to touch on ever since 1
came to this place.
Two days ago there was an editorial in the
Montreal Gazette on sornething to which the
Senate might put its hand. However, before I
corne to that, I want to deal briefly with the
proposition that has been made by the Goverrnent Leader here to the effect that the
Senate could be more useful. if it became
more of an investigative body.
Now, this sounds logical enough, but when
you consider the number of mernbers we have
on this side of the house, it is not practical.
We do not have the people to serve those
committees. Already we have had instances in
the last session in which two conunittees met
at the same tirne, and there were others like
myseif who were members of both. How on
earth are you goîng to turn the Senate from
the chamber that it is now, with the functions
and historic traditions that iA has, into an
investigative body? I don't believe this is
possible.
A f ew days ago my good friend and colleague Senator Connolly (Ottawa West) said
that he f elt that if at any time the members
of the Opposition on this side of the house
feli to 25 per cent or so below the number on
the other side, the government should step in
and appoint a number of Conservatives to
redress the balance. Well, honourable senators, that has about as rnuch chance of
corning about as Pope Paul inviting the Reverend Ian Paisley to become a member of the
Roman Curia. Such a suggestion is nonsense.
21498.-S

However, what this Senate could do is not
rnerely to have a sober second thought about
legisiation which cornes before it in bills, but
also to flnd out what is being done behind the
scenes, what is being done in an administrative way by Orders in Council. Some tirne
ago, Senator Roebuck said, and quite sensibly,
that this is ordinary administrative housekeeping. That is true, but, surely, before you
can know what the Government really is up
to, what the bureaucracy is up to, you have to
look at several hundreds of those orders in
council to see if they exceed the authority
given to thern by parliamentary statutes.
I believe that the Senate is not examining
governmnent administration, that it is flot
examining governmnent action, but that it is
leaving itself in ignorance about governmnent
action, without examinmng what the Government does between and during sessions with
its many Orders in Council. But more than
that, what are the bureaucrats up to?
I have on other occasions mentioned Clifford
Sifton, one of the very able men of our public
111e in the past, who said that i his judgment
the true role of the Senate in the future
would not be to protect the country or Pariament from the power of the Executive, but to
protect the Executive from the growing
power of the bureaucracy. This is the trend at
the present time-not only the growing power
of the Executive, which has been deait with
agamn and again, but also the growing mass of
power of the bureaucratic elite. That is what
is happening in our government today. In the
Office of the Privy Council, the Prime Minister's office, a haif-dozen men are determining
the course of the governmnent of this land. It
is not the Cabinet-hall the poor souls do not
know what is going on. Certainly the House
of Commons does not know what is going on;
nor do we know. Legisiation is sent over to us
and we examine it as best we can, but we do
not know upon whose advice that legislation
was drafted.
I think that the Senate could, through a
special committee, summnon these men before
it and ask them why they were asking for
certain expenditures, for certain changes in
the law, and for certain new laws.
Honourable senators, the business of the
Senate is not merely to put new laws on the
statute books. I am not i favour of legislation being introduced in this house. I think
that would merely make the Senate a rival
or a carbon copy of the other house. However, I amn in favour of the Senate trying to
know what is going on and why it is going

SENATE DEBATES
on, and finding out why certain expenditures
are being made.
I marvel sometimes as I go about these
Parliament Buildings and I see evidence of
expenditures being made everywhere. I saw
a case in the Senate last year, in which a vast
amount of money was spent recklessly on one
committee room. I could never find out who
authorized that expenditure, yet somebody
must have signed the authority in the last
analysis. Who gave the final authority?
This is the sort of inquiry I think the
Senate could make. If we are going to give
sober second thought to government legislation, then let us cover as wide a field as
possible and not restrict it to mere bills that
come before us; and let us find out what is
being done in the months of July and August
when Parliament is not sitting. And when the
bureaucrats and a few persons in the East
Block are running the country by orders in
council, are those orders hidden government? Are they based on legislation, or are
the bureaucrats going further even than the
powers that have been delegated to them?
This is what I believe the Senate should do.
More than that, I caution members of this
Senate: Do not think we are popular with the
public. We are not, but we would be more
popular and earn more respect if more senators took the occasion to go out into the
streets, to use the phrase used by the Prime
Minister the other day, and tell the people
what the Senate really does and what it is
about.
I had an experience about two weeks ago. I
was invited to go to Waterloo Lutheran
UniversityHon. Mr. Martin: Would my honourable
friend permit me to observe that while I
cannot agree with all that he said, in many
particulars I thought his performance at
Waterloo was masterful.
Hon. Mr. O'Leary: I thank the honourable
senator; I know he knows al about the
Senate.
I must say that I have received literally
hundreds of letters from people who said they
did not know what the Senate was doing. I
think that is true even among the young students who, in fact, had not done their homework, because in most cases a question is
asked and an answer is given, but there is no
supplementary question or follow through.
However, these young people were honest and
[Hon. Mr. O'Leary.]

October 30, 1969

sincere. They were labouring under misconceptions, but were willing to be converted,
and I think I gained some converts.
I am sure that the members of this Senate
could go out in the streets and could talk to
our service clubs and other organizations
and make many converts to the Senate. This
is my honest belief. I do not know how it
could be done, but it seems to me it is something for the individual senator: every time
he has an opportunity to speak to the public
about the Senate, he should seize itHon. Mr. Martin: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. O'Leary: -because,
as I have
said, the Senate is not popular. The Senate is
the victim of political illiteracy and of editors
who sit in ivory towers the year round and
keep talking about things of which they know
little. And, God knows, it is a victim of radio
and television.
Hon. Mr. Martin: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. O'Leary: Debate and discussion in
this country have passed from Parliament to
television, and much to my disgust. Last year
some men, who ought to have known better,
were not only trying to get television cameras
into the House of Commons and into this
chamber, but they also wanted a fleet of
microphones outside. They wanted to take
debate and discussion from Parliament itself
into the corridors.
Now I am going to pass to something else
mentioned by Senator Stanbury who preceded me. He spoke of what the Speech from the
Throne called a rising tide of unrest.
Honourable senators, let us make no mistake about it: there is in this country a rising
tide of unrest. It is not all racial; it is not all
about language. There is a rising tide of
unrest and discontent about other things. My
own belief is that we are going through a
semi-bloodless revolution, one more revelation of man's eternal disquiet; but I say that
we cannot and we must not meet it only with
counter-violence or despair.
We sec crimes of violence, riots, illegal
strikes, student revolutions, and even arson
and looting. But, honourable senators, as
much as we deplore these things, let us try
not to make the mistake of arguing from the
particular to the general, and of condemning
and damning an entire generation for the
excesses of a few. We must never, never bow
to anarchy. We must never bow to nihilism.
We must never bow to crime. But, for heaven's sake, let us at the same time be careful
to respect dissent.

Above ail, we must try to avoid meeting
the adolescent ways of youth with adolescent
judgment and behaviour of oui own, and we
must try to remember how succeeding generations often build monuments to the prophets
their forefathers stoned.
One hundred years ago de Toqueville wrote
that each period of change and tumuit in the
history of mankind resulted in greater benefits for an ever larger number of people. As a
philosophic Conservative, as one of the few
survivors of a vanishing breed of liberals
with a small "l", that is my own confession of
f aith. There may be no wonder drug solu'tions, but we must believe that in the end
freedom, sustained by law and sustained by
patience and common sense, wiil find a way
out; that millions of ordinary people will see
to it that youth, and the poor, and the underprivileged will not be cheated out of their
rightful heritage. I thank you, honourable
senators, for your indulgence.
Hon. L. M. Gouin: Honourable senators, it
is very difficuit to speak after Senator O'Leary because he is one of the most eloquent
orators 1 have ever heard.
Hon. Senalors: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Gouin: But, in his speech he did
not seem to recognize fully the fact that
under the present very difficuit circumstances
it is impossible to come with a blueprint for a
logical reform, or some kind of a ýcounterrevolution. I shall speak mainly about the
rising tide of unrest, but I am not li a position to offer any immediate remedy. It is
important, I think, that we examine carefully
and calmly the situation as it now exists in
my own province.
First of ail, to His Honour the Speaker, I
should like to off er my congratulations upon
the dignified and efficient manner with which
he presides over oui deliberations.
I wish then to offer my sympathy to the
honourable Leader of the Goverrnent (Honorable Mr. Martin) and to the honourable
Leader of the Opposition (Honourable Mr.
Flynn) for the bereavements they have suffered recentiy.
I congratulate, as other honourable senators
have done, the mover and the seconder, Senator Desruisseaux and Senator Everett, of the
motion that is now before us. Their addresses
were absolutely outstanding. Ail those honourable senators who have spoken before me
have done so in a remarkable way, and they
deserve my congratulations.
21498-6j

I regret that I was not present when the
leader on this side of the house spoke on
Tuesday in the debate on this motion, but it
was my privîlege to attend the luncheon of
the Canadian Club in Montreal at which he
delivered an excellent address on the role of
the Senate. In other words, he was doing
exactly what Senator O'Leary suggested a
few minutes ago. On that occasion Senator
Paul Martin described eloquently and practically the role of the Senate, and I believe that
ail of us have to be thankful to hlm for his
defence of this chamber, and for the efforts
he so actively made to show its merits.
Senator Martin has been a distinguished
member of foui governments, and his career
in the service of the public has been long and
brilliant. I believe that the present chapter of
his life as the Leader of the Government in
the Senate will always be remembered as a
great contribution to oui constitutional
development.
[Translation]
I share the opinion of our leader, particularly as regards his laudatory remarks of last
Tuesday about our Prime Minister.
I have known the Right Honourable Pierre
Elliott Trudeau for thirty-odd years. I have
been in a position to appreciate bis exceptional mind, his extensive and exhaustive
knowledge, the sincerity and courage of his
convictions, and especially bis passion for
social justice which, of course, extends to
those who share bis origin. In all his recent
speeches, the Prime Minister quite rightly referred to extremely serious events which
have taken place lately-we cannot delude
ourselves about people who resort to violence,
force and intimidation which, one way or another, have been particularly evident in the
streets of Montreal.
I would like to say a few words first about
this passage in the Throne Speech where it is
said that a "disturbing element in many countries of the world bas been the rising tide of
unrest, particularly among young people." As
noted in the Throne Speech, and I quote:
It has expressed itself in many ways, in
public debate, in peaceful protest and
sometimes ini violence.
[English]
It is very clear that we have to condemn
totally and without any reservation ail the
excesses that have been committed-the looting, the wanton destruction of property, the
arson, and the brutal riots-during the course
of or after so-called protest marches or
parades. The last two marches conducted on
last Tuesday and yesterday were quiet and

SENATE DEBATES
orderly, but we have to ask ourselves how
long that will endure. Those events, however,
must not prevent us from acknowledging the
deep and justified aspirations by Canadians
who believe that they are entitled to be, to a
greater degree than they are at present, the
masters of their own destiny. Those aspirations, as long as they do not come into conflict
with the general welfare, have to be acknowledged as being natural in a democratic
system. They really correspond to our ideal of
a democracy. To quote again from the Speech
from the Throne, they correspond to the
words "democratic ideal":
They must be satisfied if our society is to
attain its goals of peace and justice.
I am glad that the Speech from the Throne
mentioned those aspirations, which include
among others the aspirations of the ethnie
group to which I belong. I think it is necessary to obtain in the near future constitutional reform, but first of all we have to agree
about something because everything cannot
be done at the sarne time. I am absolutely in
favour of maintaining our federal system, but
I believe that we have to renew and reconstruct, so to speak, our Constitution. I have
especially at heart the attainment of constitutional safeguards everywhere in Canada
which would secure the survival and the
growth of the French-speaking collectivity of
which I have the honour to be a member.
I admit quite willingly that our federal
system is not perfect. It cannot possibly be
perfect, but since 1867 Canada as a whole has
developed miraculously. In my own Province
of Quebec I believe that progress has been
beyond anything which could possibly have
been hoped for. There is still much to do, I
admit, but we must first of all recognize the
situation as it is now. We must know where
we start from. We have some grievances
which I believe are justified, and if I did not
mention therm I would lack loyalty and honesty. Obviously in a democracy it is by peaceful
means, by constitutional means that grievances can be remedied and that a better
situation can be attained for my own
community.
I believe very sincerely that we in particular, Canadians of French origin, would have
much to lose if our federal union should
disintegrate. For many years some subversive
forces have been at work and we have to
realize that our nation is actually in danger.
They are small groups-it has been the same
thing in every country-but they are well
organized. They are what we call activists,
[Hon. Mr. Gouin.]

October 30, 1969

and their idea is purely and simply nihilism
or anarchy. They are against any form of
authority, whether it be federal, provincial,
municipal, temporal or religious. They want
to destroy every society. They are the enemy
of society itself, and of course we must not
consider as being members of those extremist
groups the political movements which, though
I disagree with them very strongly, are carried on legally and constitutionally. In other
words, they hope to attain through ballots
that which other people are trying to secure
by bullets or bombs. It is very clear that it is
not with bombs that you will realize any
changes which are of the nature of improving
the fate of the Quebecers. I am a Quebecer; I
am deeply and sincerely a Quebecer, but I
was born a Canadian and I intend to die a
Canadian.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Gouin: Before we obtain what I
would call a rehabilitated Constitution we
have to do the best we can possibly do with
the present system. The first rule is that we
must respect the rights of everyone and in
particular of the minority. This is true all
over the country, and it is particularly true in
Quebec at the present time. Injustice, honourable senators, always breeds injustice, but
never justifies it.
We have to obtain the co-operation of the
various political parties here in Ottawa and
in Quebec. We also have to obtain a certain
co-operation between Ottawa and the provincial capitals throughout the country. There
must be teamwork between the federal power
and the provincial powers. I must state here
very clearly that I am against the thesis
which wants to give to the federal institutions a paramount authority, une primauté
incontestable. I am of the opinion, and I
always have been, that the federal power and
the provincial power is each sovereign in its
own jurisdiction. Instead of having 10 local
powers which are subordinate to a central
power, we have in reality two categories of
power, a federal power and 10 provincial
powers which have to be co-ordinated. We
must find a way of working together to
secure the preservation of our country as we
have known it and as we want to leave it
when our last days come. We must not spoil
the heritage which we have received frorn the
past. Unless we have that kind of constant
co-operation between the central power and
the provincial powers we are heading for
disaster. I do not want to be a pessimist.
There is still time to do something, but the

October 30, 1969

SENATE DEBATES

hour has come when al men of goodwill must
unite; otherwise it may be too late, even in
the near future. This teamwork between
Ottawa and the provinces is essential to the
survival of the integrity of our country in its
fundamental diversity.
I want very sincerely to try to build a more
just society. I would say first of all that the
fact is there, that in our hearts we are all
anxious to improve the situation of all those
Canadians who in the midst of our affluent
society are now living in a sordid kind of
poverty. We must always remember that justice is the very basis of every state, of every
human society. Our duty is to try to secure in
the provincial field of action, as well as in the
federal field, the application of the sacred
rule of justice-justice for all ethnic groups,
all races, all classes, all groups and al
individuals of every collectivity.

Their speeches were wonderful, and I am glad
that I was present to hear them.
Much has been said about the Speech from
the Throne, and we have all spoken on similar occasions over the years. I think the
Throne Speech which opened this session was
a very good one, well put together and having
a good style. Although I am on the opposite
side of the fence to the Prime Minister, I am
beginning to think that perhaps we will make
a good Prime Minister out of him yet. He bas
shown great wisdom about many things. He
bas strength of character and is not afraid to
speak his mind, which is essential to a man
who is Prime Minister of a growing nation such as ours. I hope he continues to
speak his mind, irrespective of the feelings of
ail of us. I think he really understands what

Newfoundland came into Confederation very
late, in 1949. Some of you have been here for
a long, long time. I look across the chamber
and see honourable senators who have been
here many, many years. Of course we must
have some disparities in our country, but I
would like something to be done to correct
some of them.
Unquestionably, there are some very good
points in the Speech from the Throne. The
relations
satisfactory
of
establishment
between labour and management is undoubtedly of critical importance, but I would like
to know how to bring it about.
Reference is made in the Throne Speech to
tax reforms. We all love tax reforms. I do not,
of course, mean increased taxes. We would
love taxes reformed so that we would not
have to give away everything we earn in
order to live. Perhaps the Government will do
something about that some day.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: You are optimistic.
Hon. Mr. Holleti: Optimism is one of the
greatest assets any of us can have. If we do
not have optimism we cannot survive in this
world. We have to be optimistic. I recommend
my honourable friend to ponder on that
thought.
I see in the Throne Speech three lines out
of 300 devoted to fishing:
The competitive position of Canadian
fisheries must also be strengthened, not
only through new licensing and marketing arrangements, but also by extending
Canada's exclusive fishing zones.
All honourable senators know that I come
from Newfoundland, where we were brought
up on fish. If we did not have fish we went
hungry; if we did not get fish we had to do
without things. That still applies today,
although not to the same extent. We do need
many improvements for our fisheries. They
do not say they are going to do anything
about it, but at any rate it is mentioned in the
Throne Speech.
I now come to one of the important sections, which must make us sit up and take
notice. It says:
Our resources are immense, but they
are not inexhaustible. Although we must
encourage their development, we must
also conserve them and regulate their
use. Water is among the most precious of
these resources. The evidence of past failure to rehabilitate our water resources is
[Hon. Mr. Hollett.]

October 30, 1969

there for all to see-befouled water,
despoiled beaches, rotting marine vegetation, and diminished fishing.
It goes on to state that something is likely
to be done about this. I want particularly to
refer to this matter, because on October 15 I
asked the honourable Leader of the Government what part, if any, the federal Government played in bringing the ERCO plant into
Placentia Bay, Newfoundland. I was born in
Placentia Bay and that is why I am interested. The fact is that many people living there
are practically starving, because pollutants
from the ERCO plant have poured into the
water of the bay and have killed the codfish,
lobster, and herring. I have asked what part
the federal Government played in this, but I
have had no answer and I do not expect one.
Hon. Mr. Martin: You will get one.
Hon. Mr. Holleti: I would like to have it
today. I wonder if the honourable leader
could give it to me now.
Hon. Mr. Martin: No, because I do not have
the answer now.
Hon. Mr. Holleil: I do not know whether
the federal Government played any part in it
at all, but I imagine it did. I certainly know
that the provincial government had a great
deal to do with it. When I refer to the provincial government-well, you know what I
mean.
What I want to say is that before any plant
or industry such as that is established in a
particular area, surely steps should be taken
to ascertain whether it can be operated without polluting the water, the air and everything else. In this particular case, 300 men
had to give up fishing for about six to eight
weeks. I believe the ERCO plant was established by people from Great Britain. Surely
they must have known what would result
from this filthy debris and water pouring into
the ocean. If they did not know, they should
have. Now, instead of letting it run into the
sea, they are letting it run onto the land, and
I fear that this too will cause trouble. I would
like to get the full particulars about this, not
only for myself and the people of Placentia
Bay but for everyone in Canada.
Everybody likes to see new industry established because it gives employment, but in
this case, while it gave employment to about
200 men, it put another 300 men out of work.
That is not the kind of industry we want.
Furthermore, it has resulted in the death of
millions of fish. I have seen photographs

October 30, 1969

SENATE DEBATES

showing the bottom of the harbour, literally
covered with dead herring and other fish. I do
hope that the Goverirnent will do something
with regard to this particular situation.
Honourable senators, I quote again from
the Throne Speech:
The Govermnent has made known its
views on this serious problem, and has
begun urgent discussions with the provinces. Upon their completion, the Government will introduce legislation which will
enable it, in co-operation with the provinces, to improve and preserve our water
resources. Thus may we assure ourselves
of their continuing benefit for our own
domestic use, industrial expansion, and
recreation.

have to be killed by a rifle or shotgun. I
fear that this will result in hunting accidents,
and I am worried about that. I do hope the
Government will take the proper steps and
means to rectify these problems.
There are various other items in the Speech
from the Throne which are commendable, if
only they can be carried out. I shall not refer
to all of them, but I want to say a few words
about one I am interested in. I said that in the
Throne Speech there were only three lines
out of 300 that referred to fisheries. I would
like honourable senators from the Maritimes
and from any fishing area to remember what
has been done for the farming industry in
Canada by the present and previous governments. I have before me a copy of the Farm
Improvement Loans Act, and I notice that
since 1945 over $2 billion has been loaned to
farmers for the purchase of land, stock and
machinery. The Government guaranteed that
amount so that the farming industry would
be a success, and it was a wonderful success.
But now I understand that every farmer in
the west has about three times as much
wheat as he will be able to sell for the next
year, if the market continues to operate
as it has most of the time. Now, has the
Government been wise in guaranteeing so
many farm loans; did they overdo it? I am
quite sure that Maritirners know how many
loans they were guaranteed-very, very few.
I do not have the figures with me, but perhaps we should look into this. If farmers are
dependent on government-guaranteed loans of
over $2 billion in order to make a success of
their industry, then surely the same thing
could be done, although to a lesser extent, for
our fishermen.
At one time we had practically all fishermen; now there are not very many. It is only
those with the big fishing boats who really
make the money. We are in difficulties down
in the Maritimes, but it is not because we got
too many loans.
The Prime Minister said in his speech on
the address:
Once again we realize that an industrial

I refer to this again, because I want the
Government to take some action with regard
to it. Those who live in the Atlantic Provinces
or British Columbia are in danger as long as
these things are allowed to happen on our
coastlines.
Turning to another subject, I do not know
whether other honourable senators have
received postcards like this, saying "Stop the
slaughter of harp seals." I have received
several of them. In the first place I do not

I have never killed a seal in my life. I have

never killed a seal, particularly a harp seal.
As you know, the Minister of Fisheries has
introduced regulations whereby it is illegal to
kill seals until they are about 80 pounds in
weight. By that time harp seals are able to
dive into the water and get away. Consequently, very few of them will be killed, and
thousands of people in Newfoundland, Prince
Edward Island, and other places will be

their families from hunting harp seals. This
modest source of income is now being taken

that we should not kill the seals and that we

west coast docks. So, the dissolution of the
Dominion Coal Board, provided for in this
measure, will not mean that coal is no longer
considered an important energy resource.
It is the intention of the Government to
transfer the staff of the Dominion Coal Board
to the Department of Energy, Mines and
Resources and to integrate the staff into the
energy sector of that department. In this way
the coal resources of Canada can be considered quite properly in the context of the total
energy supply and demand picture for
Canada. The department has the responsibility for co-ordinating, promoting and recommending national policies and programs on all
forms of energy. It seems to be the proper
department that should now be concerned
with this kind of method.
The staff of the Coal Board will assist in
this responsibility and, as the burden of
administrating subvention assistance terminates, it will be able to devote more time to a
wide range of research and investigations,
methods and problems of mining and marketing coal, and the competitive position of coal
vis-à-vis other forms of energy.
As part of the energy sector they will continue as a co-ordinating body within Government, between governments and with the coal
industry.
The department as a whole will strive, the
minister assures me, to ensure that the coal
resources of the country are utilized to the
maximum extent possible within an overall
policy aimed at the most effective contribution of each of our energy resources.
We acknowledge with gratitude the services
of those various individuals who, from 1947
on, have served on the Dominion Coal Board.
The chairman at the present time, Mr. J.
Watson MacNaught, will continue to serve
and to advise the deputy minister of the
department during this period of transfer of
responsibility.
In summary, the repeal of the Dominion
Coal Board Act acknowledges that a new
approach is necessary to deal properly and
efficiently with this resource under presentday conditions of our energy economy.
The Control Production Assistance Act,
which will come to an end with the passage
of this measure here and in the other place,
was originally called the Maritime Coal Production Assistance Act. That act was passed
in 1949 with the main purpose of making a
loan available to the Dominion Coal Company, whose mines were in urgent need of

mechanization and modernization. The name
of the act was changed in 1959 and the act
was extended to assist coal producers anywhere in Canada. The act provides for aggregate loans to coal producers not exceeding $20
million and with a maximum of $12 million
to any one producer. The period during which
loans can be made under the act terminates
on October 31 of this year-that is, tomorrow.
The latest annual report by the Dominion
Coal Board on the operation of this act covers
the fiscal year ending March 31, 1969. At that
time almost $161 million had been issued in
the way of loans, and $5 million of that had
been fully repaid with interest.
The special arrangements which have been
made for coal producing areas of the maritimes and the development of an economically viable coal mining industry in western
Canada abrogates the need for this act. The
Department of Energy, Mines and Resources
will have the continuing administrative
responsibilities concerning repayment of
moneys still on loan under this act.
The Canadian Coal Equality Act, which
likewise will cease to be operative with the
passage of this measure in Parliament, was
passed in 1930 to implement a recommendation of the Royal Commission on Maritime
Claims to provide a bounty to Nova Scotia
steel producers equivalent to the tariff drawback on imported bituminous coal then
enjoyed by steel producers in central Canada.
The bounty was 49j cents per ton' on al
Canadian bituminous coal used to produce
coke for the manufacture of iron and steel.
Total payments under the act have amounted
to $9.8 million until 1961-62; all of this aid
went to the steel works at Sydney. I am sure
Senator John Macdonald, better than almost
anyone else, would be aware of that.
Subsequent to 1961-62, small annual payments have been made to the iron and steel
smelting operations of the Consolidated
Mining and Smelting Company of Canada at
Kimberley, British Columbia.
In 1949 the duty on imported coking coal
was removed. In addition, commencing in
1965, the Sydney area coal used in the steel
plant became eligible for subvention assistance against American imported coal, the
bounty therefore becoming a bonus on domestic coal which is used in the steel plant.
The Cape Breton Development Corporation
is now responsible for the coal operations of
Cape Breton Island, and the corporation
should be free to develop its coal markets in
a clearly identified way and not under the

SENATE DEBATES
provisions of diverse acts. Accordingly, when
the corporation took over operations of the
Dominion Coal Company in March of 1968, all
payments under the Canadian Coal Equality
Act ceased.
It is the view of this Government that the
reason for this act no longer exists and that it
should be repealed.
I do not believe that this matter need go to
the committee. However, I have no objection,
if Senator Macdonald or any other senator is
of the opinion that it should.
Hon. John M. Macdonald: Honourable senators, I know we are all grateful to the honourable Leader of the Government for the very
fine explanation he has given of this bill. As
he has pointed out, it repeals three acts which
relate to the coal industry-the Canadian Coal
Equality Act, the Coal Production Assistance
Act, and the Dominion Coal Board Act. These
were all useful and important acts which
gave valuable assistance to the industry, and
they are being repealed now only because
they are no longer needed in regard to some
regions or because they have been superseded, as it were, in the Nova Scotia region by
the Cape Breton Development Corporation
Act.
Under the Cape Breton Development Corporation Act, assistance is provided to the
coal industry in Nova Scotia while it is being
rationalized. I cannot say that I am overly
fond of the word "rationalized," because what
it actually means is that either the mines
have been closed or production has been
stabilized at a fairly low figure.
Honourable senators, it is not my intention
today to discuss the coal industry in Nova
Scotia, but I do want to say a few kind words,
as it were, about the Dominion Coal Board
which will cease to exist when this bill
becomes law. As already indicated, the board
was formed in 1947 and came into existence
at a time when there was a crisis in the coal
industry. That crisis followed the war. During
wartime, production was all-important and
cost was not considered So, in the post-war
period there was difficulty for the industry to
adjust to the new conditions. The old markets
were gone and production costs and transportation costs had increased; moreover, competition from other fuel was severe.
The Dominion Coal Board was of tremendous assistance in helping the coal industry
adjust to new times and new conditions. As
has been pointed out, its staff was very
expert and had a great knowledge of the coal
industry, both production and marketing, and
[Hon. Mr. Martin.]

October 30, 1969

every time there were difficulties the coal
board was more than anxious to assist.
I am sure it will not be taken amiss if I
mention that normally it was the chairman of
the coal board who had to assume the
responsibility, the board itself serving more
in an advisory capacity. Its chairmen were all
very able men, but the one who deserved
special mention, in my view, was Mr. O'Brien
because he was chairman during the time of
greatest crisis for the coal industry. I well
remember how the board was anxious to
assist the industry in Nova Scotia when its
very existence began to be threatened by its
loss of markets for various reasons. Indeed, I
think for the past number of years, the board
devoted practically all of its time to trying to
assist the Nova Scotia coal industry, and certainly it is through no fault of the board that
a better solution could not be found than the
one finally adopted.
Honourable senators, as the Leader of the
Government also mentioned, since April 1,
1968, federal subventions on the movement of
coal have ceased. I think it is of interest to
mention that since this type of assistance to
the coal industry was first begun in 1928, the
federal Government has paid out in subventions on coal the tremendous sum of
$317,288,873. By provinces this sum was paid
out to assist the coal industry in this waythe greatest amount, $246,404,992, went to
Nova Scotia; $10,450,136 to New Brunswick;
$3,264,434 to Saskatchewan, and $57,169,311 to
British Columbia. However, I believe it is
interesting to note that in the same period in
which the sum of $317,288,873 was paid out in
federal subventions, the duty collected by the
Federal Treasury on imported coal and coke
amounted to the still larger sum of
$366,056,455. So, to March 31, 1968, the Federal Treasury took in over $48 million more
from duty on coal and coke than it paid out
in subventions. Now, I do not say that this
amount was over and above all money spent
by the federal Government to assist the coal
industry. It may well be that some other
forms of assistance would cut down this sum,
and certainly the amount to be paid to the
Cape Breton Development Corporation to
cover the losses on its coal operation wili
probably be substantial for the first few years
at least. But, honourable senators, I hope no
one has the impression that government aid
to the coal industry was something unusual or
unique. Indeed, I expect a great many other
industries in Canada have received substantial assistance from governments in one form
or another.

TRIBUTES
THE LATE HON. OLIVE L. IRVINE
THE LATE HON. CYRILLE VAILLANCOURT

Hon. Paul Martin: Honourable senators, as
we begin our week's work in this chamber
our hearts are filled with sorrow at the passing of Senator Olive Irvine.
Senator Irvine was present in this chamber
last week, although we were aware that she
had been taken ill the week before.
It remains for me to say that she was a
respected and beloved member of the Senate,
to which she was appointed nine years ago.
She was one of the most faithful attendants
in this chamber and in committee.
Senator Irvine was born in Holland, in the
Province of Manitoba. She was the first lady
senator to represent the Prairie region. She
represented it with great credit to herself, her
convictions, and ber background. Senator
Irvine graduated from the Winnipeg Normal
School, and devoted much of her life to
teaching. We in this chamber profited greatly
from having so distinguished a woman and
school teacher among us.
To her husband and her family we extend
our deepest sympathy. To the honourable
Leader of the Opposition (Hon. Mr. Flynn),
Senator Irvine's leader in this chamber, on
behalf of all honourable senators on this side
I extend our sincere regrets.
His Honour the Speaker and those responsible for managing the business of this bouse
have arranged a memorial service to be held
at St. Andrew's Presbyterian Church on
Thursday next, November 6, at 2 p.m. This
will give many more senators an additional
opportunity of paying tribute to our former
colleague. This arrangement bas been made
possible by the co-operation of the Reverend
Dr. A. W. Currie. When in Ottawa, Senator
Irvine attended St. Andrew's Presbyterian
Church.
We recognize the contribution Senator
Irvine bas made to her province, to Canada,
and to the Senate. We will miss her greatly.

November 4, 1969

[Translation]
It was with deep regret that we learned of
the death of two of our distinguished colleagues: Senator Olive Irvine and Senator
Cyrille Vaillancourt, Commander of the Order
of St. Gregory the Great.
Poor health forced Senator Vaillancourt to
resign a few months ago, after sitting in the
Senate from 1944 to 1969. For a few years he
was Deputy Leader of the Government in the
Senate, a duty he fulfilled with dignity and
competence. Senator Vaillancourt certainly
was one of our greatest senators. He was the
voice of Quebec in this house.
He had a long and successful career in the
world of business, devoting all his professional life to the credit union movement. For
nearly half a century he was its spokesman,
both in Quebec and in the rest of the country.
During forty years, he worked with the
association of maple syrup producers, directing its co-operative activities.
The Province of Quebec mourns the loss of
a great pioneer and servant, for Senator Vaillancourt devoted all his energy to the progress of his province and his country.
On behalf of the Senate, I extend sincere
condolences to Mrs. Vaillancourt and ber
family.
[English]
Hon. Jacques Flynn: Honourable senators,
death never takes a long holiday, especially
in this chamber. In this year, 1969, the Conservative caucus in the Senate bas suffered
an indescribable amount of grief and sorrow.
We have suffered the loss of former Senator
M. Wallace McCutcheon, and Senators Clement A. O'Leary and Gunnar S. Thorvaldson. Now to that list we must add the name
of Senator Olive L. Irvine, a most esteemed
colleague.
It is said of educators that in order to be
successful at their chosen profession they
must be as patient as they are erudite, as
dedicated as they are personable, and as selfless as they are wise. Senator Irvine by
profession was an educator and, judging from
the qualities she manifested here in the
Senate, I am sure she was as valuable as a
teacher as she was useful as a senator.
Senator Irvine brought to the Senate, when
she came in 1960, a background of significant
administrative and political experience. She
was a former President of the Women's Conservative Association of Manitoba, former
President of the South Winnipeg Association,
and Manitoba's representative on the National

November 4, 1969

SENATE DEBATES

Capital Commission. She faithfully attended
our sittings in this chamber, and I can personally attest to the fact that she did fine work
for the Opposition. She was thorough and
trustworthy, and a task could always be
entrusted to ber with the assurance that it
would be dealt with efficiently and expeditiously. Her contribution to the undertakings
of the Senate Committee on Divorce was significant and very much appreciated.
She showed great courage and responsibility by being present in the Senate when we
resumed our sittings on October 14 last,
despite a very serious heart attack which she
suffered last summer, and despite the advice
of many, including myself, that she should
take it easy and wait until she was fully
recovered. Senator Irvine was as quiet and
self-effacing as she was charming and able;
an incomparably gracious and distinguished
lady, she was the ideal woman senator. The
Senate will long remember her. To ber busband Jim, a friend of us all, and to ber son,
we offer our most sincere condolences.
[Translation]
Honourable senators, those of us who, like
myself, attended the funeral of our former
colleague, the honourable Senator Cyrille
Vaillancourt, in Lévis, yesterday afternoon,
were able to judge of the important place he
occupied in Quebec society.
With his death, a remarkable man has been
taken from us. He will be remembered
mainly for his work with the Desjardins
Movement, which he carried on for half a
century. Need I say that this Movement is
today one of the most powerful financial
groups of the Province of Quebec.
Senator Vaillancourt was a very hardworking man. One bas only to read his biography to realize how very intensive was his
activity at all times.
He was a kind and charitable man. For
many years he was president of the St. Vincent de Paul Society and he also participated
in the work of many other charitable
organizations.
He was a positive man. Cyrille Vaillancourt
was not the rebel type. Instead of complaining
and of adopting negative attitudes, be resorted to positive action. He was firmly convinced
that his countrymen, provided they were
hard-working and determined enough, could
have as much success as anyone in the world
of business, trade and finance.

He was a member of the Senate for 25
years. His contributions to our debates were
typically those of the man that I have just
described, remarkable by their wisdom, their
kindness and their positive character.
Having known him since 1943, while he
was special adviser to the president of the
Wartime Prices and Trade Board, the lamented Donald Gordon, having often seen him
thereafter and sat with him in this house for
almost seven years, his death is for me a very
personal loss. I keep an affectionate and
admiring recollection of him.
On behalf of the opposition, I extend to
Mrs. Vaillancourt, to all ber children and the
other members of the family our heartfelt
sympathy and I assure them that we will
gratefully remember their dear departed.
Hon. Maurice Bourget: Honourable senators, I wish to join with my colleagues to
express my sorrow following the death of
Senator Vaillancourt.
We all knew that his health had been failing for two or three years, but we hoped that
he still had a few years left.
I know that he will be missed by all the
members of this bouse because we all held
him in high esteem, having learned to
appreciate his many qualities of heart and
mind as well as his sincere love for his
country.
The loss we experience, honourable senators, is doubly felt by those who were close to
him, namely, his fellow-citizens of the Province of Quebec and more particularly, the
people of the Lévis area.
Pupil and follower of Commander Desjardins, founder of the Caisses Populaires, be
worked without respite during most of his
life, to establish what bas now become an
important financial institution which operates
in all parts of the province and even outside.
The people of Lévis will never forget that
they owe to Senator Vaillancourt's efforts the
fact that our city bas become the center of
gravity of the Caisses Populaires which, in
Lévis proper, employ more than a thousand
people.
As his master Desjardins, he advocated
mutual aid, co-operation and charity not only
through his words but through his actions.
There are many families in our region and
outside and many individuals to whom he
gave his precious advice and discreetly some
of his own money.

SENATE DEBATES
For these reasons and many others too
long to list here, hundreds of people of Lévis,
of the province and many senators gathered
yesterday afternoon, in our parish church, to
pay their last respects to this great Canadian.
His death is a great loss for Canada as a
whole, for the province and particularly for
his own town of Lévis.
Once again, in this chamber, I express my
most sincere sympathy to Mrs. Vaillancourt
and ber children.
At the same time, I must say I was most
surprised to hear last weekend that our colleague, Senator Olive Irvine had died. A few
days ago, she was here in this chamber. I join
with the two leaders to extend my heartfelt
condolences to her husband and to the members of her family.

November 4, 1969

Long an active member of the Progressive
Conservative Party, she held at one time or
another nearly all offices at a provincial and
federal level. For four years she was President of the Women's Conservative Association of Manitoba; for three years President
of the Women's Progressive Conservative
Association of South Winnipeg; and until ber
death she was on the National Executive for
Manitoba.

Honourable senators, it is with deep sadness that 1 take the floor, foilowing those who
aIready paid tbeir tributes to the memory of
our colleague, Senator Cyrille Vaillancourt, to
express my sympatby to Madame Vaillancourt and to the members of the f amily.
They spoke with such feeling and eloquence that I may be brief; nevertheless, my
words will be most sincere.
[English]
Honourable senators, what a note of sadness has been injected into our meeting
tonight by the passing of two of our distinguished senators.
I knew Senator Vaillancourt for many years
and worked with him on many war work
committees during World War II. Everyone
who followed his active career-in his personal life and in the course of carrying out
the heavy demands of his successful business
life, as well as his duties in the Senate-must
have realized that even in the midst of such
an active life he had been blessed with the
gift of the secret of inner composure and a
proper sense of values. He was a very religîous man and was neyer ashamed to admit
his dependence on God as the source of ail
grace and strengtb.
I remember so well the day he told us in
the- Senate that he would not be with us for
long. That day he bid us "au revoir". After
the sitting I told hlm how grieved I was to
learn of the illness whicb he felt would be
fatal. He replied that bis motto through 111e
had always been, "May the will of God be
done", and that he had bad a good and full
life. He did not say this merely as an act of
resignation. It was his faith and true simplicity of soul that led bim to seek in all his
endeavours to carry out the implications of
bis own motto, andi bow to the will of Divine
Providence.
He did return to Parliament Hill months
after bis farewell speech, and on that occasion I told bim that bis daily dose of maple
syrup must be working miracles, for he
looked so well. He smiled but it was a sad
smile, and bis bilingual comment was, "I'il
say this in French to you: «au revoir'-your
Englisb goodbye is so cold." Then be added,
wîth a gesture that manifested an affection
for others, "God bless you and your family,
and this time 'au revoir' for I may not be
back ta see you again."1

With profound sorrow I extend to Madame
Vaillaricourt and the members of tbe late
senator's famîly my most sincere sympathy
for the loss of a distinguisbed and generous
husband and a most devoted father.
Hon. John J. Connolly: Honourable senators, I will speak for only a few moments.
Like every other senator, I was most upset
and shocked wben, at a memorial service for
the late Mr. Justice W. B. van Lare, the
High Commissioner ta Canada from Gbana,
on Sunday morning, the minister of St.
Andrew's Churcb announced that Senator
Irvine had died.
Olive Irvine certainly must have been one
of the most gentie women of ber time. She
was kind, graciaus, and friendly, and wben 1
had the responsîbilities of the leadersbip of
this bouse she was most belpful. Once upon a
time Newman wrote a long definition of a
gentleman. I know of no comparable definition of a lady, but if tbere is one, Olive Irvine
was its personification. To say that we wiil
miss ber bere is very mucb of an understatement. The people who are most sorely
bereaved are ber devoted busband and ber
very loving son, both of wbom I have bad tbe
privilege of meeting and knowing.
Honourable senators, I sball not repeat
wbat I said in this chamber on tbe occasion of
Senator Vaiilancourt's retirement. There were
few people wbom. 1 bave met in my time bere
who bave impressed me more. I felt very
bonoured that he sbould have been my
deputy for a number of years.
Senator Vaillancourt was a great Quebecer
and a great Canadian, but above ah bhe was a
great man. This was clearly demonstrated
yesterday, as Senator Bourget and the bonourable Leader of the Opposition have so eloquently described, at bis very impressive
funeral in Levis. I tbought tbe note of Senator Vaillancourt's career was touched very
precisely by the Cardinal Arcbbisbop of
Quebec, Cardinal Roy, wbo presided at bis
funeral. He dilated upon the great cardinal
virtues of prudence, justice, fortitude and
temperance. He said that tbe virtue that the
late Senator Vaillancourt preacbed and
practised above all others was the virtue of
justice, especially of social justice. His life
in the Caisse, in the co-operative movement,
ini the St. Vincent de Paul Society in Levis
and in Quebec epitomized exactly wbat His
Eminence meant and wbat we ail know of
the late Senator Vaillancourt and of bis life.
The co-operative movement and all that it
involves, including bis work in the Senate,
is.bis great monument.

Senator Vaillancourt had good judgment.
He always protected what hie thougbt were
the interests of the people be represented,
although he knew that others had opinions as
well, and to these he was always willing to
listen. I do flot think I ever saw a better man
in Opposition or one who attracted me more
than did Senator Vaillancourt.
He was very kind to my children. He used
to send them presents of maple syrup at
Christmas time, always with a beautiful
letter. We corresponded frequently, and we
were friends because we believed in one
another.
The honourable the Leader of the Opposition bas told us that the grim reaper has
made frequent visists to tbis assembly-tbat
is sadly true. The memory of Senator Vaillancourt will remain green here, as it will in bis
own part of the country, for many years. 1
wish to express to bis f amily my deepest
sympathy. It would seem that a man has died
younger than hie should, because perhaps hie
overreacbed himself i bis efforts for the
benefit of bis community and others, but we
know that ail who live must die, passing from
nature to eternity.

PEACE-KEEPING
QUESTION

FORCE-

Hon. M. Grallan O'Leary: Honourable
senators, I sbould like to direct a question to
the bonourable Leader of the Government,
and I apologize to him for flot giving notice.
Tbis is my question.
In view of tbe fact tbat we are wltbdrawing
whatever diplomatie representation we bave
in Cyprus in tbe interests of economy, what
then in tbe interests of economy wrnl be tbe
position of our troops in Cyprus? How long
are tbey to remain there? Wben are tbey to
be witbdrawn?
If and wben they are

withdrawn, will this be at the instance of
U Thant, the Secretary General of tbe United
Nations, or at the instance of tbe Canadian
Govemnment wbich is responsible to the taxpayers of Canada?
Hon. Paul Martin: Honourable senators, the
announcement made yesterday by tbe Secretary of State for External Affairs that we
were going to close our mission in Cyprus is
in no way related to the tenure of tbe United
Nations force in Cyprus, nor is it related to
our participation in tbat force. Tbe force
came into being before we bad a mission in
Cyprus. Our embassy in Israel, wbicb is near
by, looked after wbatever diplomatic arrangements were necessary witb the Government
of Cyprus.
The force bas been given a tenure until
some time in the month of December. It was
renewed for a period of six montbs wben it
was last deait witb by the Security Coundil.
The Secu.rity Coundil will decide in December
wbetber the force is to be renewed. If it is to
be renewed, tbe Canadian Government will
give consideration, as it bas during tbe past
four years, as to whether it will continue tbe
force.
I would not want this remark to be construed as implying tbat we bave any intention
of not fulfilling our obligations as a member
of tbe United Nations.
Tbe honourable senator also asked wbetber,
wben the force is witbdrawn wiil it be at tbe
instance of tbe Secretary General of tbe
United Nations or of the Canadian Government. It will be recalled tbat wben the United
Nations Emergency Force in tbe Gaza Strip
was disbanded as a resuit of President Nasser's request, and tbe attitude taken by India
and Yugoslavia, two components of tbe force,
the Secretary General announced tbe disbandment of tbat force. In tbe naine of the
Government at tbat time, I took tbe view tbat
it was not open to the Secretary General to
bring about an end of the force; that the
constitutional way was to bave tbe organ of
the United Nations tbat brougbt tbat force
into being make tbe decision.
I asked tbe Secretary General wbat bie
would do witb regard to the force in Cyprus,
because my Governiment was greatly concerned about the matter. The reply of the
Secretary Generai, now a matter of record,
was that the force in Cyprus would not be
disbanded witbout consultation with the
Security Coundil.

on a point of order. I should like to indicate
that the honourable Leader of the Government bas changed since he was in the other

The Senate resumed from Thursday, October 30, consideration of His Excellency the
[Hon. Mr. Martin.]

November 4, 1969

Governor General's speech at the opening of
the session, and the motion of Hon. Mr. Desruisseaux, seconded by Hon. Mr. Everett, for
an address in reply thereto.
Hon. James Duggan: Honourable senators, I
am pleased to have the opportunity to express
my views in this august chamber in the midst
of such an abundance of ability and talent.
Being aware of my own shortcomings I trust
that you will bear with me during this brief
period.
I wish to avail myself of this opportunity to
offer my sincere congratulations to the Speaker of the Senate on the noble manner in
which he discharged his duties during the
First Session of the Twenty-eighth Parliament. May he be spared to continue his duties
for a long time to come.
I wish also to offer my sincere congratulations to the mover, Senator Desruisseaux, and
the seconder, Senator Everett, on the motion
for an address in reply to His Excellency the
Governor General's Speech at the opening of
this session. They both carried out their
assignments with credit and distinction and
demonstrated once again the brilliance they
bring to this chamber.
Honourable senators, in an effort to refrain
from repetition, I wish to deal only with that
part of the Speech from the Throne dealing
with regional disparity.
It is reassuring to hear that our present
Government is not only concerned with
regional disparity in Canada but is determined to do something about it. I am concerned about one specific region, the Atlantic
Provinces, particularly the Province of Newfoundland, where it is becoming increasingly
difficult to maintain a level of services that
may be judged adequate by any standard.
I believe it is only fair to say that there is
no easy solution. We need capital injected on
a massive scale to develop our resources in
Newfoundland. To that end the Government
must encourage the industrialization of our
depressed areas by granting tax exemptions,
et cetera, over a period of years. Then like
that great man, Sir Winston Churchill, said
during the early days of World War II, "Give
us the tools and we will finish the job." I say,
give us the capital for development and we
will finish the job of regional disparity. We
need financial assistance to develop our
resources and to get our economy on its feet,
if we are to be elevated to our rightful place
as self-respecting citizens of this great nation.

November 4. 1969

SENATE DEBATES

I submit that the Speech from the Throne
reveals the Prime Minister's careful planning
for the future, and that we in Newfoundland
may look to the future with hope and
confidence.
Newfoundland was dealt a staggering blow
this spring by the removal of our passenger
train service, on all too short a notice. I
submit that such a decision was taken without due consideration of all the facts. In the
Canadian National Railways' own submission
before the Canadian Transport Commission, it
revealed that 125,000 people travelled on our
trains during the previous year. This represents 25 per cent of Newfoundland's population. Can this percentage be matched by any
other province? Will the railway's records
disclose province by province the profit and
loss in train passenger service? Or is Newfoundland's performance kept separately to
be treated separately? Travel conditions
under adverse weather and winter conditions
were never given proper thought. If they
were, then the reconnendations of the Newfoundland Government would have received
favourable consideration. It asked that the
trains be kept in operation for another two
years in conjunction with the buses, until
their suitability under our winter conditions
had been demonstrated. When the dreadful
day arrives and we have to meet the results
of tragic highway accidents on our icy highways, then we will be expected to be merciful
and say, "Forgive them, oh God, for they
knew not what they did."
During the past few years much time and
space have been devoted to the subject of
industrial strife and disruption in essential
services caused by strikes, and aimed particularly at organized labour. This has been coupled with the hint that strikes should be
banned in essential services. Such a suggestion, and a suggestion it can only be, poses a
good question, "What constitutes essential
services?" Is it just the so-called "public services" such as postal and railway services, or
is it the desire and intention to define al
services such as mining, oil, durable goods,
construction, et cetera, as essential? If this is
so, then is the desire and intention to ban the
right to strike applicable to the greater
number of workers in the greater number of
industries in Canada?
Surely, we do not intend to play the role of
the ostrich, by burying our heads in the sand
to endeavour to escape from the thoughts of
the great price which Canadians have paid in
the past and are willing to pay in the future
to preserve liberty and freedom in other

lands. I submit that Canadians will not tolerate having these thoughts scuttled, curtailed
or under-valued on the home front.
A strike must be recognized as fundamentally a confrontation of forces on an economic
level, and is a manifestation of conflicts and a
means of regulating these conflicts. In our
industrial society, different viewpoints cannot
be avoided. Therefore, they must be accepted.
At this point I would like to quote from a
speech delivered on July 1, 1965, by our
revered and late Governor General, General
Vanier:
Let us remember that no one point of
view, nor any one way of life, has any
monopoly of virtue. Quite the contrary.
The road to ultimate wisdom lies in comparison, mutual compassion and understanding. Each of our people, each one
individually has some element of truth,
some glimpse of enlightenment to offer to
all of us. Therefore, when we meet a man
with an opinion that is new to all of us,
or a people with a tradition we have not
met before, let us look at them with
respect and perhaps even with envy, for
he and they know something that we do
not, and they have achieved a further
step towards wisdom.
The banning of strikes and the imposition
of compulsory arbitration are neither desirable nor in keeping with our times. However,
the Government, which is the supreme
authority and guardian of the common good,
may regulate the enforcement of the right to
strike. In doing so, very serious attention will
have to be given to the other side of the
ledger, regulation of the margin of profits and
the instituting of the mechanisms of collective
bargaining-for which there is no substitute-for peaceful and lasting settlements in a
more polished fashion, to assure justice to our
wage earners with more speed, honesty and
sincerity.
Today, wage earners find themselves and
their representatives obliged to ride out
motorized negotiations with horse and buggy
facilities. Therefore, there is a crying need for
action.
The lack of communication between labour
and management is a breeding ground for
suspicion and unrest. I wish to urge the Government to take immediate action to facilitate
improved communications in this respect.
There always was, and there still is, a natural conflict of interest between the two parties. Therefore collective bargaining, mean-

SENATE DEBATES
ingful collective bargaining, was instituted to
resolve the difference of opinion. Let us not
monkey too much with it. Falkland once said:
When it is not necessary to change, it is
necessary not to change.
But let every effort be made to instill in it
honesty and sincerity.
It is comforting to see Senator Croll and his
committee on the march to smoke out poverty. May the good Lord guide them on their
way, and I trust that in their recommendations they will remember the words of
Jefferson:
Widespread poverty and concentrated
wealth cannot long endure side by side in
a democracy.
I wish to deal but briefly with the question
of the presence of international unions in
Canada and the controversy which seems to
surround this subject being generated by certain interests. It should be common knowledge that their presence in Canada is by invitation, dating far back in the past, responding
as they did to the numerous calls sent across
the border for assistance from the workers of
Canada in a desperate effort to be rescued
from the terrible state of oppression instituted and practised by unscrupulous employers
of that day. In return for the response to such
calls, sending assistance and direction, with
substantial cost to themselves and without
anything in return, many, if not all, international headquarters south of the border now
command, and will continue to command, the
respect and undying gratitude of our Canadian workers.
The claim that certain interests have
endeavoured to advance about United States
domination of our Canadian unions has
failed, notwithstanding the devious ways and
means employed, and I suggest that if those
responsible would be polite enough to mind
their own business and leave this matter in
the hands of those directly concerned it
would be greatly appreciated by the rank and
file of all international unions in Canada.
No opportunity seems to be passed up to
belittle and smear international union leaders
and members alike. Some of the tactics, however, do have a little humour. For example, a
few years ago when a particular wage movement was announced-and if my memory
serves me correctly, it was the railway labour
unions wage movement-news media carried
the attack that union leaders were sponsoring
the wage movement only to justify further
increases in their own fat salaries, and there[Hon. Mr. Duggan.]

November 4, 1969

fore did not command the confidence and
support of their members. In a subsequent
wage movement, the same news media was
right back on the job with the story that
union leaders had lost control of their members and were being driven to submit further
wage demands. Honourable senators, you pay
your money and you take your choice.
A news dispatch carried in a Montreal
paper a few years ago quoted from a pamphlet released by the Canadian-American
committee under the chairmanship of Professor Crispo as follows:
International unions should try to give
their Canadian members more autonomy
if they wish to continue to prosper in this
country.
The same article, quoting from the pamphlet,
goes on:
Although some international unions
allow
a good deal
of
Canadian
autonomyI submit that twisting is being done with
the word "some," either by the news dispatch
or in the pamphlet itself. It may be correct
that some international unions may be subject to restriction in their Canadian policy
making, and if they are not some Canadian
union leaders may be using it as a crutch to
lean on because of their failure to provide
active and/or sound leadership. If there is
such a restriction it is up to the rank and
file, with good leadership, to have it removed.
There are some twenty or more international
railway labour unions in Canada on which I
would be greatly surprised to find any such
restriction.
I wish to quote from the constitution of
one of those international railway unionsthe Transportation-Communication Employees
Union, formerly the Order of Railroad Telegraphers, of which I have the honour to have
been a member for 46 years:
The general committee of a subordinate
division shall consist of a General Chairman, and General Secretary-Treasurer,
and all District Chairmen, shall have
jurisdiction over the affairs of the division. It shall exercise the authority and
perform the duties hereafter prescribed
in this constitution and by-laws. It may
enact such by-laws as it deems necessary
in the conduct of its work and in the
interest of its members.
Anyone endeavouring to interfere with the
present set-up of international unions in

November 4. 1969

Novemer 4,1969SENATE
DEBATES

Canada, except the members of such unions,
will be branded as meddlers, and will be
running the risk of inciting trouble and creating an unhappy and unpleasant situation. 0f
course, fools wa]k in where angels fear to
tread.
In conclusion, I wish to congratulate the
Government on the Throne Speech. It indicates the laying of the foundation on which to
buid the Just Society. The Prime Minister is
a person with a belief, and as Mili once said:
A person with a belief in a social power
is equal to rnnety-nine who only have an
interest.
I arn grateful to ail honourable senators for
bearing with me during this address.
Hon. Romuald Bourque: Honourable senators, before proceeding with my address, I
wish to congratulate the mover and seconder
of the Speech from the Throne for the brilliant way in which they accomplished their
task. The mover, Senator Paul Desruisseaux,
covered the whole Canadian scene, and the
seconder, Senator Douglas D. Everett, made a
fervent appeal on behaif of the province he
represents.
I completeiy endorse ail that Senator Desruisseaux has said on behalf of our Speaker,
Senator JTean-Paul Deschatelets, P.C., on
behaif of the Leader of the Governiment in
the Senate, Senator Paul Martin, P.C., and his
two assistants, Senator A. H. McDonald and
Senator Leopold Langlois, and on behaif of
the Honourable Jacques Flynn, P.C., Leader
of the Opposition in the Senate, and bis
assistant, Senator Lionel Choquette.
On Saturday, October 25, 1969, 1 came
across an advertisement in one of our local
dailies in Montreal, published on behaîf of
the Canada Department of Labour. As a rule
I have very littie time at my disposai to read
the advertisements in any paper, but I was
struck with the title of this one and so I read
it. For the record I would like to read this
advertisement. It is entitled:
If you can see five different reasons for
not hiring these people, there's oniy one
word for you.

We believe most Canadians find this
totaily unacceptable to our way of life.
The Department of Labour is extremely concerned by the cases of discrimination that occur every day. Someone is not
hired simply because of religion. Or
colour. Or ethnic origin. Or race. What's
equaliy insidious is that women in our
work force are sometimes treated as
second-class employees. In many cases
they're paid less than men for the saine
work. They're refused promotion because
of their sex. And ini spite of seniorîty,
often dismissed first when there's a layoff.
It must stop. And it must stop now.
Such unfair employment practices can
destroy the soul of a nation. And its
economy too.
The responsibility for wiping out bigotry lies with each and every Canadian. In
your day-to-day if e you can do more to
help than ail the laws in the world.
Because nothing ever works unless
people make it work. Your actions
individually and the example you set for
your children are what really count.
We'1l all know when we're free of bigotry. When every single one of us can
look at that photograph and see just five
people.
That's part of what we're ail about.

This advertisement was signed by the Honourable Bryce Mackasey, Minister, and J. D.
Love, Deputy Minister.
Now, the subject of my address is a plea on
behaif of the women of Canada. God bless
them ail! I arn convinced that they could be
classed among the smartest and most intelligent women of the world, the greatest in
beauty and appearance, and second to none in
efficiency.
They are to be found everywhere in ahl the
professions, in the hospitals, in ail the artistic
centres, in the business world and in the
homes as housewives. They have now învaded
every field of endeavour and occupy, in many
instances, positions of command.
Yet, here is this ad published by the

woman in the world to receive the Eleanor
Roosevelt Humanities Award and also the
Woman of the Year award. The latter is presented by the Montreal State of Israel Bonds.
Mrs. Bronfman, a rich woman, has beauty,
money, position and compassion. Above all,
she is a wife, mother, grandmother, art collector, home decorator and menu planner. My
sincere congratulations to Mrs. Bronfman,
who is also the proud possessor of many other
honours.

weekly, published in December 1967, an article entitled "Les droits de la femme proclamés par les Nations unies"? This new

THE

RIGHTS OF WOMEN PROCLAIMED
BY THE UNITED NATIONS

After the Declaration on the rights of
man, and the Declaration on the rights of
the child, the General Assembly of the
United Nations adopted on November 7,
1967 the "Declaration relative to the
elimination of discrimination against
women". We quote below the eleven articles of the Charter of the Rights of
Women.
Art. 1. Discrimination against women,
because it denies or restricts the equality
of the rights of women with those of
men, is fundamentally unjust and is an
attack on human dignity.
Art. 2. All appropriate action shall be
taken to abolish such laws, customs,
regulations and practices as represent
discrimination against women and to
guarantee adequate legal protection of
the equal rights of men and women.
[Hon. Mr. Bourque.]

November 4, 1969

(a) The principle of equality of rights
shall be embodied in the constitution or
legally guaranteed in some other way;
(b) International instruments of the
United Nations Organization and of its
specialized agencies related to the elimination of discrimination against women
shall be accepted by ratification or adhesion and shall be fully implemented as
rapidly as possible.
Art. 3. All appropriate action shall be
taken to inform public opinion and to
inspire all countries with the will to abolish prejudice and do away with all practices, whether customary or not, based on
the notion of the inferiority of woman.
Art. 4. All appropriate action shall be
taken to vouchsafe to women, under conditions of equality with men, without any
discrimination whatsoever:
(a) The right to vote in elections and to
be eligible to all publicly elected bodies;
(b) The right to vote in all public
referendums;
(c) The right to occupy public posts and
to exercise all public functions.
These rights shall be guaranteed by law.
Art. 5. Women shall have the same
rights as men as concerns acquiring,
changing or retaining a nationality. Marriage contracted with a foreigner shall
not automatically affect the nationality of
the wife, deprive her of nationality, or
husband's
the

Art. 6.-1. Without prejudice to the protection of the unity and harmony of the
family, which remains the nucleus of
every society, all appropriate action shall
be taken, including legislation, to guarantee to women, whether married or not,
equal rights with men in the field of civil
law, and particularly:
(a) The right to acquire, administer,

(b) Legal capacity and the exercise

SENATE DEBATES
It is true that Canada some time ago
appointed a royal commission to study the
various aspects of women's life in this country, but it is incredible how seldom a woman's viewpoint is aired in either of our
Houses of Parliament, on radio or television
or in the press. The voice of woman is rarely
heard outside the home or within relatively
small community organizations.
It is true that during the past year or so
women provided the leadership in the consumer group demonstrations, petitions and
appeals which led to the termination of trading stamps in some supermarkets and focused
public attention generally upon the retail
prices of food. It is also likely that women
have had some influence in bringing about
the legislation which made possible a reduction in the prices of health and life-saving
drugs.
May I pause here a moment to pay tribute
to one of our lady senators who passed away
last weekend. Senator Olive L. Irvine sat in
this house for many years. She was a most
gracious lady, of high intellect, and she contributed greatly to the deliberations in this
chamber and in many of the Senate committees. We all mourn her passing and will miss
her greatly in the future. To her husband and
family I extend my deepest sympathy.
Before proceeding further with my address,
I would like to state that in this chamber we
have now four gracious lady senators who
made valuable contributions to the deliberations of the Senate. We consider ourselves
very fortunate, for these lady senators in
every instance possible bring to our attention
the point of view of the female population of
Canada.
In the greater political arena where the
principal political, economic and social problems of our time are discussed, women are
strangely silent and almost completely
ignored. This is a serious mistake and some
effort should be made, either by the political
parties or by the various governments in
power, to ensure that the feminine view upon
these important subjects be sought, heard
and, above all, heeded.
It is shocking to learn, for instance, that
while less than one per cent of our annual
government expenditures at the federal level
is devoted to foreign aid, a hundred million
men, women and children throughout the
world are positively starving. Surely, if
Canadian women were better informed about
this situation, if they participated te a greater
degree in the shaping of our national and
[Hon. Mr. Bourque.]

November 4, 1969

international policies, they would not permit
such misery to continue and would insist on
Canada making a much greater effort to end
it. Women are more concerned about such
matters; their lives are devoted to the care of
their families and they know what it is to
have a sick or hungry child. They should be
encouraged to add to our principles of government the quality of compassion.
Inflation may be a subject for economists,
but the place it hurts most is the homewhich is the woman's domain. She is the first
to know when food prices rise, when it is too
costly to replace worn-out clothing or furnishings, when the children's dental care
must be postponed because of high costs. She
knows when this is happening, but by then it
is too late. Her participation in the necessary
steps to end inflation should not only be
encouraged but her views upon the subject
should be solicited. Through women's organizations, schools, churches and other organizations, she has the power to exercise-she
needs only to feel that she is part of the team.
Men talk about housing; women live with it
or the lack of it. Men discuss poverty areas;
women live in them or are in contact with
them every day. Yet the plans for emergency
housing, for the war on poverty and for
urban renewal, are constantly made and sometimes carried through without the slightest
effort to consult the women of the country.
Never, indeed, are women considered as a
special group-as Canadians unlike the
others, for example. The old are so considered
and, of course, the young who demonstrate at
schools and universities and in the streets of
hippieville. There are special radio and television programs about youth and its problem;
the programs for women are about cooking
and homemaking; they are seldom, if ever,
about the role of women as a special interest
adult group thoroughly concerned about
national and international programs and
policies.
Finally, women make up at least half of the
membership in our two language and culture
groups-our two nations or communities or
our two founding peoples, however you may
wish to describe them. The separatists in
Quebec are not all men; some of the most
active ones are women. They are attracted to
separatism because, as in all revolutionary
organizations, they find that they are wanted
and encouraged. Women have always been
found on the barricades when the revolutionary chips are down; they are often the leaders, the firebrands, the inspiration to others.

November 4, 1969

SENATE DEBATES

In revolutionary times-and the whole world
today is passing through a period of emotional and economic upheavals-the established
societies must find a means of reaching the
minds and hearts of women. Long, dull pronouncements of constitutional clauses and
promises of legalistie and complicated legislation are poor recruiting agents among those
who find their causes among hungry children
or dispossessed people.
Women are much more practical than men.
They view government in terms of homes and
health and human happiness; they are enemies of injustice; they feel before they
reason.
And it is feeling that we men in government lack today. We know all the reasons; we
are filled up with statistics and historical
facts. We know who won all the battles and
how our rights and freedoms were won. But
we have become prisoners of our superior
knowledge and our respect for institutions
and laws. Somewhere along the line we have
left the people outside and we are much
slower to respond to the cries of those who
suffer, from either real or imagined injustices,
than we are to answer the formal charges of
the professionals who are versed in our
Canadian laws.
A little feminism added to our deliberations
would go a long way. And the kind of feminism I am talking about is not involved with
politics or government. It is still very much in
the home, but it represents 50 per cent of our
population, French or English speaking.
In case I should be suspected of being thoroughly biased in favour of women, let me
make one concession to the men and one
apology on women's behalf. In spite of their
great human qualities, their compassion, their
understanding and their generosity, many
women are hawks, not doves. Some of them
are among the leading proponents of the war
in Vietnam and they flood the newspapers
and the legislators' mailboxes with their urgings for all-out bombing and more and more
conscripts. This sort of thing has been true in
every war. It is the women who hand out the
white feathers, who talk about cowards and
slackers. It is the women with sons on the
battlefield who complain because their neighbours' sons are still at home.
But not all men are peace-loving, either.
After all, it is the men who provide the generals and the flyers who drop the bombs. And
it is the men who publicly stand in the way
of peace when a way to it could be found.
Basically, most women are doves in the best
21498-7

sense of the word. They believe in peace with
justice; they believe in aid for the needy and
laws which help all people to have their own
homes, live in security and enjoy the good
life.
Again, these are the unheard; these are the
women whose voices are needed in Canada
and who should be encouraged to participate
in the solution of our problems.
Canada is, in essence, a marriage of two
peoples-French and English. Perhaps if it is
to survive, it must become an actual
marriage of individuals from the two peoples.
Each year a few English-Canadian men
take French-Canadian brides, and a few
French-Canadian men take English-Canadian
brides. Among these few, there may be
some separatists; after all, we have divorce
courts to make their separations legal.
But the understanding which develops within
a family, the love for each other regardless of
original ethnic background, soon makes all
talk of political, economic or cultural separation unrealistic.
It has been said that it is the wives who
keep the family together. It could be the
wives of Canada who will keep the Canadian
family together. The report of the Royal
Commission on Bilingualism and Biculturalism is a magnificent document. It has much to
say about Canada's most troublesome problems and it makes some wise recommendations. Read it, however, and you will notice it
places great emphasis on the 10 per cent
representing the part of the population in any
section of Canada which is French-speaking.
It says nothing about the 50 per cent all over
Canada who are "woman-speaking." It talks
about schools and factories and the civil service, but not about wives and mothers and
daughters and sweethearts.
Certainly, on their record, men in Canada
and, indeed, all over the world, have little to
boast about when it comes to solving intimate
national or international problems. Isn't it
about time we invited the women to come
into the conference room-not just one
woman or two women or a dozen women, but
hundreds and thousands of them-to let us
have their views on what we should do, and
to encourage them to join us in doing the
things they think should be done?
If they helped us to even the smallest
degree, the millions of hungry people around
the world, the thousands of homeless at home
and the people of our two founding races
would be eternally grateful. The hands that
rock the cradle are needed to hold men's
hands that are rocking the boat.

SENATE DEBATES
Hon. Josie D. Quari: Honourable senators, I
think I would be very ungrateful on behalf of
the women of the Senate and perhaps all
women's organizations of Canada, if I did not
thank Senator Bourque for defending women
so eloquently tonight in the Senate. In fact, I
do not think a woman would have had the
courage to go so far, Senator Bourque. Of
course, it makes it all the stronger when it
comes from a gentleman senator, particularly
one from the Province of Quebec, when so
many other provinces feel that the women of
the Province of Quebec are sort of downtrodden. We know we are not. As a matter of
fact, before Confederation, the women of
Quebec were the only women in Canada who
had a vote.
However, Senator Bourque, I feel that you
have done a noble job and one which took
great courage, because I am sure that the
moment you leave this chamber someone is
going to say to you, "Flattery is going to get
you nowhere." But I assure you it will. And I
do think that you will receive many letters of
congratulations. I for one shall be very
pleased to have your text with me when I
speak to women's organizations, and I shall
say, "See what the gentlemen of Quebec
think about their women."
Thank you.
Hon. John M. Macdonald: Honourable senators, perhaps for reasons of self-preservation,
just before moving the adjournment of this
debate, I should say that I agree with every
word Senator Bourque said respecting the
ladies.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Macdonald, debate

THE LOAN COMPANIES ACT
BILL TO AMEND-SECOND

READING

Hon. Azellus Denis moved the second reading of Bill S-9 to amend the Loan Companies
Act.
Honorable senators, I do not wish to keep
you very long, but I merely want to point out
that this Bill S-9 amending the Loan Companies Act, the passage of which I have the
honour to propose, is exactly the same as the
one I proposed last spring and which was
bearing number S-38.
However, we must except three slight
changes, two of which are explanatory and
the third enables a loan company to make

special loans guaranteed by the State under
the Small Businesses Loans Act.
You can find the report of the proceedings
on that Bill S-38 in the Debates of the Senate
of May 6, 8, 20, 22, 27, and 29, 1969 and you
can also refer to the proceedings of the
Standing Senate Committee on Banking,
Trade and Commerce of May 21, 1969.
This bill was passed by the Senate and
referred to the House of Commons which was
unable to consider it before the end of the
last session. It was therefore necessary to
bring it back again under Bill S-9.
Honourable senators, I do not intend to
repeat the comments which I then made
and which entirely apply to this bill. I wonder
even if it would really be necessary to refer it
to the committee, since this has already been
done. However, I will gladly comply with the
request of honourable senators.
Consequently I will merely briefly point out
the main changes made under this bill to the
Loan Companies Act.
[English]
The authorization of a letters patent system
for incorporating companies and amending
existing charters including specification for
minimum amounts of capital ($500,000).
An expansion of powers to the loan companies, for instance:
(a) Authorization for investments in nonCanadian securities where a company is doing
business out of Canada.
(b) Broadening of the power to invest in
real estate for the production of income.
(c) Removal of the statutory margin
required in relation to collateral loans.
(d) Authorization for mortgage loans, in
excess of 75 per cent of the value of the real
estate where the excess is insured under a
policy of mortgage insurance issued by a registered company.
(e) An increase in the "borrowing" power,
from a maximum of 15 times the capital,
surplus and reserves, to 20 times.
(f) The power of companies to own subsidiaries that conduct a mutual fund business or
subsidiaries that conduct business reasonably
ancillary to the parent company.
The bill further provides for:
A revision in the procedures and system for
control of companies that are financially
weak or are in financial difficulty.
Extension of existing prohibitions against
loans to directors or officers, to prohibit loans
to, or investments in major shareholders, and

SPEECH FROM THE THRONE
MOTION FOR ADDRESS IN REPLYDEBATE CONTINUED

The Senate resumed from yesterday consideration of His Excellency the Governor General's speech at the opening of the session,
and the motion of Hon. Mr. Desruisseaux,
seconded by Hon. Mr. Everett, for an address
in reply thereto.

Hon. John M. Macdonald: Honourable
senators, may I first extend my congratulations to the mover and the seconder of the
Address in Reply to the Speech read by the
Governor General. I imagine that they are
getting a little tired of hearing congratulatory remarks and perhaps they are
getting the idea that in offering such remarks
we are but following a formal and pleasant
custom. If they have such an idea, I can
assure them that it is a mistaken one. I can
also assure them that the compliments of
those of us who are participating in this
debate are sincere, because we feel that the
speeches given by the mover and the seconder
were excellent; they were well prepared, well
delivered and worthy of high praise.
Honourable senators, I do not intend to discuss the Throne Speech itself at any length. It
is the type of speech that we expect from the
Government. It is a well written speech, precise language is used throughout, and in the
printed form it is pleasing to the eye and a
good example of the printer's art. Not wishing to be too critical, I content myself by
saying that I was not impressed by the contents. Looking at the printed form I thought
the package was attractive, but that the goods
were of an inferior quality. I must say I was
somewhat impressed by the very high praise
given to the speech by Government supporters and, having listened to some of them, I
read the speech again to see if I had missed a
few paragraphs. But no, it was the same old
speech-one which needs a lot of praise but
which does not deserve a lot of praise.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: The same old gang.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Personally, I was also
impressed by the number of platitudes the
speech contained. I was only surprised it did
not contain some touching and sentimental
reference to the Government's concern for
home and motherhood. But then, I suppose
these subjects could not be mentioned
because high interest rates preclude the
building of homes by the average person, and
the loosening of the laws pertaining to abortion preclude any reference to motherhood.
The Throne Speech mentions inflation, and
in recent months much has been said of the
steps taken by the Government to combat it.
That it is a serious problem, no one will deny.
The classical definition of "inflation" was that
too many dollars were chasing too few goods.
But today that definition does not meet the
situation. There would appear to be a new
type of inflation that is difficult to define-one

SENATE DEBATES
difficult to find the causes of and consequently difficult to find remedies for. Certainly the
old definition of "too many dollars chasing
too few goods" is no longer true. There are
plenty of goods and plenty of services, but
prices for goods and for services are high and
always going higher. The cause of the
increase in prices is not the scarcity of goods
or services. Because of inflation, our money is
worth less in terms of purchasing power and
this creates a special hardship on those of low
income and on people who must live on fixed
incomes.
It is gratifying that the Government has at
last realized the problem and is trying to
solve it. I am somewhat concerned that the
measures taken, and those proposed or threatened to be taken, seem to be old-fashioned
remedies. We have no assurance they will
bring satisfactory results; we have no assurance that these old-fashioned weapons will be
adequate to fight a new type of inflation.
Perhaps some new tools will have to be developed and used.
Professor Graham, an economist at Dalhousie University in Halifax, said recently,
Somehow in an economy as economically diversified as Canada more tools of
economic policy must be developed that
can be applied in a discriminatory
manner to case expenditures where there
are increasing pressures on fully employed resources, and expand expenditures where there is general unemployment.

November 5, 1969

I do believe that in this day and age it
should be possible to develop policies which
would halt and control inflation without hurting the weak regions of our country more
than the strong. If these old-fashioned remedies which are being applied are to be effective, then I think more unemployment is the
inevitable result, and more unemployment
will first come where unemployment is
already too high.
The Government has announced that there
will be a reduction in the civil service of
about 25,000 positions, though fewer than
5,000 persons will be actually laid off, the
others being eliminated by normal attrition.
Perhaps I should interject here that it is
somewhat startling to realize that 25,000 positions in the public service can be eliminated
without any apparent loss of efficiency. I only
hope that when these people in the public
service are being fired some discretion will be
used and some compassion will be shown.
Otherwise, it will be those at the lowest level
of employment, those who have no one to
speak for them, those who have no economic
strength, who will lose their employment so
that the Government can point with pride to
a reduction in the public service.
You may think I exaggerate this danger,
but I have seen the notice of termination of
employment received by a man who had
worked for 17 years in the public service.
After 17 years' service he was given eight
days' notice that he was fired, and it was
small consolation to him that the notice also
stated that his services had been quite satisfactory. I think the final paragraph of that
notice is worth quoting. It reads:
May I offer my personal thanks for the
fine work and co-operation you have
shown during the term of your employment with the Department.

I think it is apparent that the professor had
in mind the effect of these anti-inflationary
measures on the economic life of Nova
Scotia and of the Atlantic Provinces in general. Think of the effect of the measures taken,
or proposed or threatened to be taken-the
freezing of the federal Government's general
expenditures, the high interest rates, the res- I can only say that I deplore a policy which

bound to bear more heavily on low-income
tax people than on those with a higher
income? Let us take the single person with an
income of under $1,800 a year. If be had an
income of $1,700 a year, he would have to pay
an income tax on $600 of it. This tax would
amount to $77.60 a year, or more than one
haif his monthly income. With respect to
the couple whose income is less than $3,000 a
year, if the husband's income were $2,900 hie
would have to pay an income tax on $800 of
it, which would amount to $102.80. So, by our
income tax policies, we tax the poor and
make tbem poorer.
Surely, in a country like Canada we should
be able to finance our governmental expenditures without taxing the pittances of the poor.
I arn not going to discuss the plight of the old
age pensioners, other than to say that despite
the fact that their only income is old age
security, nevertbeless they too are taxed.
Honourable senators, I do hope that the
Special Senate Committee on Poverty will
consider these matters and make an interim
report recommending that the Government
raise ils exemptions for income tax to exempt
at least those who are classified as living in
poverty.
Honourable senators, there is one other
matter I would like to bring to your attention.
I believe most people will agree that it is the
first, the foremost and the most important
duty of the state to protect the person and the
property of each of ils citizens. This has been
so since people first banded together in coinmunities. We read of the days of long ago
where in those regions wbere "the King's
Writ did not run" powerful nobles protected
the person and property of their followers in
return for certain services and paymenls. We
have read that in the early days in the United
States wben the frontier was being pushed
westward each man carried arrns to protect
bis family and himself, and when communifies were formed this task was turned over to
law enforcement officers.
Today, of course, it is well recognized that
we look to the state to protect our person and
our property. This is clone by means of a
police force. This protection is given so that
the citizen can, at least in tbeory, live in
peace and walk the streels of bis comrnunity
without fear of injury to his person. Let there
be no mistake about this, regardless of the
other obligations, the first and most important
duty of the state is to protect the person of
the individual. 0f course such protection can
neyer be absolute. The state cannot guarantee

absolute protection to ils citizens. But over
the years much bas been clone to give protection. The state bas, with some exceptions,
provided competent, trained and dedicated
police force. Yet even the best of forces
cannot prevent these crimes agaimst the
peoeson. They cannot be expected to do so. It
is impossible.
Honourable senators, I believe we in
Canada have been well served by our police
forces. Yet in spite of their best efforts crime
is increasing. A recent report by the Dominion Bureau of Statistics revealed that
Canada's crime rate jumped 9.5 per cent
during 1968. What is the solution to this problem? I do not know if there is one; indeed, I
doubt very much if there is an acceptable
solution. Personally, I believe that ini this age
of unrest and resentmnent, and indeed rebellion, against authority it is unrealistic to
expect the state to be able to give the citizen
the protection he is entitled to expect.
So, believing tbis, I think it f ollows that the
state should pay compensation to the victims
of crime, especially crimes against the person.
Should flot the victims of crime be compensated on somewhat tbe saine principle that
bas given us Workmen's Compensation laws
for industry? It was recognized that accidents
in industry are inevitable, so it should also bie
recognized that crimes against the person are
going to be committed and the victims should
be compensated in so f ar as money payments
can compensate.
In some provincial jurisclictions there is
now legisiation which provides for the payment of such compensation. It is in effect in
Saskatchewan, Alberta, Ontario and I believe
in Newfoundland. I tbink Saskatchewan was
tbe first province to have this type of legisiation and, since the provisions of all the acls
are practically similar, I would like to read
section 8 of the Saskatchewan Act wbich
deals witb the payment of compensation. It is
as f ollows:
8-1 Where a person is injured or krnled

(a) is the resuit of an act or omission of

SENATE DEBATES
(c) resulted to the person while he was

enforcement officer in Saskatchewan
who was carrying out his duties with
respect to the enforcement of law;
the board may, in its absolute discretion,
upon receipt of an application in writing,
make an order in accordance with this
Act for the payment of compensation.
Honourable senators, I would like to sec
this type of legislation extended to all
Canada. I realize, of course, it may well be
said it is not a matter of federal jurisdiction.
However, I think it should be possible for the
federal Government to take the lead in this
matter-to have it discussed at some of these
conferences on the Constitution that are
taking place-and, if necessary, to make some
kind of arrangement with the provinces to
the end that every citizen of Canada would
be assured of being paid compensation for at
least injury to his person as a result of criminal acts against him, and to ensure that there
would be uniform legislation throughout
Canada to provide for this.
Honourable senators, there is but one other
matter I would like to discuss with you. The
mover of this address mentioned the fact that
Canada had extended diplomatic recognition
to the Vatican. I think he was the only speaker who mentioned it. I only mention it now to
say I do not join with those-even those of
my own religion-who f eel this was a praiseworthy action. I think the motives for this
action are very questionable. The mover of
the address said:
Indeed, the Canadian Government
would have put itself in a rather strange
position had it actively sought an
exchange of ambassadors with Communist China while refusing such an
exchange with the Vatican.

Novemnber 5, 1969

'honourable senators, all I can say is this is a
cheap motive for recognition and one I would
expect would be resented by the Vatican
State. I will give the government the benefit
of a very weak doubt I have and say I believe
its action was motivated by a higher consideration, but, if so, it has not received the
publicity these other lower motives have. Personally, and as a Roman Catholic, I could not
care less whether or not Canada extended
diplomatic recognition to the Vatican, any
more than I would care if, for reasons of
trade, it extended such recognition to Red
China.
I might interject here that it does offend my sense of pride as a Canadian that
my country is apparently going on bended
knee to Red China to obtain an exchange of
ambassadors. And I suppose also it offends
my sense of pride as a Roman Catholic that
my country should recognize the Vatican
State for a cheap, small, low or unworthy
motive.
Honourable senators, I have spoken longer
than I usually do, and I thank you for your
kind attention.

Hon. Hazen Argue: Honourable senators, I

it to a committee which, under the distinguished chairmanship of Senator Roebuck,
heard witnesses. I believe that the evidence
taken at that time played an important part
in the thinking of the Government and in this
specific action. In my opinion, the Senate in
this instance showed commendable leadership.
Another question that we in this chamber
discussed during the last session was that of
DDT and its control. At that time I expressed
great opposition to its continued use. My
study of the matter has convinced me that
DDT is an evil substance, that it is doing
great damage, that legislatures throughout the
world are beginning to outlaw it, and that the
Parliament of Canada should be doing the
same thing. I was intensely pleased when the
Prime Minister announced that the action to
be taken by the Government will reduce the
use of DDT by about 90 per cent.
It seems to me that environmental pollution
is becoming more and more serious. Governments at various levels are paying greater
attention to it, and I am encouraged by the
commendable leadership shown by the Government of Ontario in taking action to clean
up water and air pollution. I believe there
will be subsequent action by the Government
of Canada, based upon studies that have been
made and discussions that have taken place,
which will go a long distance in a relatively
short time to make sure that we in Canada
live in the best possible type of environment,
and that we cease polluting our own air,
water and land resources.
Honourable senators, I wish to speak this
afternoon mainly on the present agricultural
situation in western Canada, which is very
serious. It has been the subject of a great deal
of discussion in the other place. It has
received much attention by farm organizations and is receiving more and more attention by provincial governments. I bring this
matter forward at this time in order to
impress upon the members of this house that
there is in fact a very serious financial crisis
in the Prairie Provinces at this time.
Commendable action has been taken in the
present crop year. The Governnent has provided for cash advances through legislation up
to $6 per acre, to a maximum of 1,000 acres
and, therefore, to a maximum of $6,000 for
those with relatively large farms of 1,000
acres and more.
The Wheat Board took action at the beginning of the current crop year to allow farmers who, through no fault of their own, but
21498-8

because of the unavailability of elevator space,
were unable to deliver grain in the crop
year that ended on July 31 to carry those
quotas and to have them added to the quotas
in the new year. This simply means that if a
particular farmer was unable to obtain an
income because he was unable to deliver his
grain, because there were no box cars or no
elevator space, he has another chance within
a month or a few months from now to recover those deliveries. However, there is still a
serious loss to that individual farmer because
the price has been cut in the meantime. The
farmers who were able to deliver their grain
obtained a higher price than that which will
be obtained by the farmers who, through no
fault of their own were unable to deliver
their quotas.
But, this is the first action of this kind that
has been taken by the Canadian Wheat
Board, and I commend them for it. I hope
that wherever farmers have been unable to
deliver their quotas through no fault of their
own-whether it be the Durum quota which
is slated to end on November 28, or any other
quota-those quotas will be extended in order
to provide this kind of equality.
There is a tremendous crop on the Prairies,
as everybody knows. Harvest weather was
excellent for a number of weeks, and then it
turned very bad. The majority of the crop bas
been harvested. It is in good condition. It is in
the bins. It is of high quality. But, some of
the crop-I do not know the amount because
it varies from district to district; in some
districts it is practically nothing, and in
others it is 80 per cent of the total-is still
unharvested. It is grain under the snow, and I
think there is a growing need for action at
this time by the Government-action that
was taken a number of years ago-to amend
the cash advances legislation in order that
cash advances may be made to farmers who
have grain under the snow. The experience of
the Government in the past is that the security turned out to be quite adequate. The farmers threshed their grain in the spring and
repaid those cash advances.
For people in northern Alberta and northern Saskatchewan, and perhaps for people in
some areas of northern Manitoba, this is a
drastic emergency. The cash advances legislation is not available to them because the
wheat is not in the bins. It is in the fields.
The only reason it is not in the bins is
because the weather has been adverse. I

SENATE DEBATES
would recommend to the Government that if
this kind of action is taken now it will be a
sensible move towards helping people who
are in very serious difficulty at this time.
World markets are lower, sales are lower,
and prices are lower. One can go about
apportioning the blame wherever one might
wish to but I think, in the main, we in this
country have been caught up in a world
situation that agricultural experts in Canada
and elsewhere were unable to foresee. Two or
three years ago every so-called knowledgeable person said that the population explosion
would be so great that the future problem of
the world would be in producing enough food
to feed the hungry. That may be a major
problem still, but it is not as great a problem.
There are huge surpluses of grain, and there
is an emergency on the Prairies resulting
from the slowness of delivery and from the
fact that the cash advances legislation, good
as it is, covers only part of the crop. Costs are
going up continuously, and farmers are seriously pressed for money.
The honourable member for Assiniboia in
the other place, A. B. Douglas-Mr. Speaker,
I pause to say that I am not referring to
anything that happened in the other place
but to a member of the other place-took
the initiative to have a meeting with the
heads of the railway companies and presented to them a document he had prepared showing the very unfair distribution of
box cars among elevator points in western
Canada at this time. The table he presented
showed that some points had had a large
number of box cars and a neighbouring point
had had almost none. He compares, for example, two towns with which I am acquainted.
One, Avonlea, has had 70 box cars since
August 1 last. A neighbouring town, Truax,
on the same railway line with exactly the
same kind of grain production, has received
two box cars. Mr. Douglas' table points out
that this pattern is in fact too prevalent all
across the Prairies.
The producers of western Canada are looking for action to solve this box car dilemma.
The Canadian Wheat Board issue the orders,
that they wish so much grain hauled out. The
orders are handed to the elevator companies,
who distribute their orders among their
varlous elevator points. Then they are given
to the railway companies to be hauled out.
The fact of the matter is that the jurisdiction
is so badly divided that when you endeavour
to pin down box car distribution one passes
[Hon. Mr. Argue.]

November 5, 1969

the buck to the other. I would hope the railways will take immediate action to correct
this unfair situation and that the Canadian
Wheat Board and producers, through the
block system they are talking about, may be
able to bring about a very simple solution by
way of a statement, namely, that the box cars
will be spotted in such a way that all producers will have a reasonable opportunity to
market their grain.
I have before me very interesting tables
prepared by the member to whom I have
referred, showing the distribution of box cars
since August 1 last among various points in
western Canada. I wonder if I may have the
permission of honourable senators to have
these tables printed as part of our record.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, this is statistical information. Has the
honourable Senator Argue given the source of
this information? Is it agreed that these tables
appears as an appendix to the record?
Some Hon. Senators: Agreed.
Hon. Donald Smith: Honourable senators, I
rise on a point of order simply to ask the
honourable senator whether he intended this
to form part of the speech he is now making
or does he intend that it be attached as an
appendix?
Hon. Mr. Argue: I do not mind having it
included as part of the speech-whichever
arrangement is more convenient.
The Hon. the Speaker: I understand the
consensus to be that these figures should
appear in the speech rather than as an
appendix.
Some Hon. Senators: Agreed.

Hon. Mr. Argue: A very huge surplus of

grain on the Prairies at this time, the
limited number of box cars, and very limited
delivery causes a tremendous pressure on
price. The Canadian Wheat Board has been
slashing the prices of wheat, oats and barley.
The latest figures I have show that the price
of wheat, as compared to one year ago, has
been reduced from $1.95 to $1.83 for No. 1. If
you go down to No. 4 wheat, for example, the
reduction has been 33 cents a bushel, from
$1.83 to $1.50. No. 3 oats bas been slashed 18
cents from 83 cents to 65 cents. No. 1 feed
barley has been reduced from $1.06 to 99
cents. The producers are not happy about
these prices being reduced by the Canadian
Wheat Board. Nobody likes to see his income
reduced, but that is not their biggest fear and
that certainly is not their greatest criticism. I
think they are all realists enough to know
that if they cannot sell their grain at a high
price it is better to take somewhat less and
get some of it sold than to hold it with a
fictitious high price on it.
The Canadian Wheat Board bas reduced
the price and is trying to move the grain, but
it is moving very slowly. The farmers who
have been eligible for the cash advance have
taken it. They have huge obligations to meet.
They have been extending, modernizing and
becoming more efficient. Their capital outlay
has been tremendous. They have large debts
and their interest rates are piling up. They
are desperate for money, so what is the situation? A black market has developed in the
sale of grain. I use the words "black market"
not to say that it is illegal, but to describe the
type of market it in fact is. If a farmer transports a bushel of grain to the elevator he
expects $1.20 a bushel. If any honourable
senator wanted to buy millions of bushels of
wheat in western Canada for 60 cents a
bushel, half the price, all he would have to do
is advertise that he is ready to buy it and it
would be delivered to any point he designated. This is in fact the going price for wheat
[The Hon. the Speaker.]

November 5, 1969

on this so-called black market. The price for
barley is not the 70 cents or so at the elevator-the honourable Senator McDonald will
correct me if I am in error-but it is 45 cents
a bushel. The going price for oats is not the
50 or 55 cents at the elevator; it is 30 cents a
bushel, perhaps less.
I have the latest issue of The Western Producer-it shows this kind of price. Here is an
advertisement that I thought was significant:
Wanted To Buy Feed At Bin Paying 25¢
for oats, 30¢ for barley, 40¢ for wheat.
This man, God bless him, is willing to go
for it. I think he will get a lot of it because
people are desperate for money. They are not
able to get anywhere near what I think
should be the correct value for their grain, so
this kind of black market bas developed. It is
transferring money out of the pockets of the
grain producers and putting it into the pockets of large feed companies and large commercial livestock feed organizations.
The financial ruin of thousands of farmers
who have been producing grain only to add to
the profits of some of these feed producers or
large commercial feeding organizations will
not accomplish anything of value. It complicates everything much further than this. The
Government of Canada brought in legislation
to provide cash advances up to $6 an acre up
to a six bushel quota on the basis of $1 per
bushel. When the farmer delivers his grain he
needs to repay it on the basis of half the
selling price of a bushel of wheat. So the
farmer repays the loan on the basis of about
60 cents per bushel for wheat. He had an
advance of $6 and he repays it on the basis of
60 cents a bushel for wheat. He has to have a
ten-bushel quota to repay his cash advance.
Last year the maximum quota was five bushels, and some farmers delivered four bushels
or less.
In other words, this cash advance has been
designed, in the light of events, in such a
manner that it is absolutely impossible for the
farmers to repay it, because there will be no
ten-bushel quota. If they continue with it,
and if the situation remains as it now is, the
farmers themselves will go deeper into debt;
the Government, with the white paper and
this cash advance legislation, cannot hope to
be repaid, and farmers will be in an absolutely impossible financial position.
What is more, it is common knowledge that
in many instances there are not ten bushels
of grain on hand to repay the quota, and the
farmer does not have to swear that there are.

November 5. 1969

SENATE DEBATES

In other words, if he opened up, the cash
advance would never be repaid because it
could not be repaid.
All I am saying is that money is being put
out and the collection formula and delivery
formula are such that the cash advance
cannot possibly be paid. The farmers are
being faced with an impossible debt, and the
clean-up boys-the feed grain companies and
these big commercial feed companies-will in
a short time make fabulous amounts of
money. But I would think that if it keeps on
they may wreck the livestock industry by the
kind of production that will be brought about.
They will in fact rue the day they got this
almost give-away grain to put into the production of livestock.
I have been asked by people, including my
colleague Senator Desruisseaux, why the
farmers do not produce more livestock, why
they do not quit producing something they
cannot sell. I think the farmer is exactly like
any businessman in this chamber. Show him
where he can make a dollar and he will go
there to make it. If the farmer is convinced
he can make more money raising cattle and
hogs than by raising wheat, he will do that,
and he will do it very quickly. Some thought
so in July and bought cattle at 30 cents a
pound, $34 a hundredweight or more. It is
now October and the price is down to $24 a
hundredweight. They have already lost
money-they have already lost their shirtsunless the price goes up again. For them,
therefore, that has not been a solution.
The federal Department of Agriculture
thinkers in this country have not yet come
forward and said to the individual farmer that
he should increase his livestock production
by 10 per cent or decrease wheat production
by 10 per cent. Some people say it should be
cut, others say the farmers should be retired,
others say they should keep it and we will get
rid of it sooner or later. There is no consistent
advice, never mind a policy.
In the last few weeks, under the Farm
Improvement Loans Act the rates of interest
to farmers who wish to go into livestock production enterprises has increased from 7Î per
cent to 8J per cent. That is no encouragement
to go into the livestock business.
The Premier of Saskatchewan, the Honourable Ross Thatcher, has introduced legislation in that province dealing wilh interest
rates in a modified way by telling the banks
that if they will lend to farmers in Saskatchewan up to $6,000 for the purchase of livestock, the Government of Saskatchewan will

subsidize the interest rate beyond 7 per cent.
I think the Government of Saskatchewan
should be congratulated on that kind of
course, which is helpful. But one government
goes in one direction and another government
goes in a different direction, and the farmer
really does not know what he should do.
Farmers are increasing their livestock production. This is what they are doing, and they
do not mind it. However, they are greatly
afraid that if they produce too many hogs and
too many cattle, exactly the same will be
done to the hog and cattle market as has now
been done to the feed grain market to which I
have referred. Farmers are told to produce
more hogs, and they are producing more hogs.
When the Saskatchewan farmer starts to
produce hogs he does it in a big way. I know
some who are getting together collectively to
get hog production plants that will cost over
$100,000, because they are desperate and this
is what they feel they should be doing to
market their grain.
The Task Force on Agriculture has said
that the wheat acreage should be reduced by
10 million acres. On the average, hog production in Canada is around eight million, and I
think an acre of land should be able to produce two hogs. If hog production were
doubled, therefore, it would take only four
million acres of wheat production from the
land. So, any major change from wheat production on the Prairies to livestock would
swamp the livestock industry of this country.
I have in my hand a report from the
Dominion Bureau of Statistics, which points
out that in 1968 there were 3,353 million
pounds of meat slaughtered in Canada. I have
converted that into wheat on the basis that
six pounds of wheat can be converted into
one pound of meat, and it works out to a
little over 300 million bushels of wheat. Anybody will tell you that there is a bigger surplus than that. So, if farmers who have produced wheat decide to produce livestock and
use their surplus for the production of livestock, they could easily double the livestock
production for all Canada with their surplus
grain and bring absolute chaos to every beef
and hog producer in all parts of Canada. In
other words, if we need to take some land out
of grain production and put it into livestock
production, as I am sure we do, we should see,
where we are going and know what we are.
doing, and not just say we will take the land.
out of wheat and put it into livestock production. That could bring about even greater
chaos than there is at the present time.

SENATE DEBATES
I have a suggestion to make. It is perhaps
an emergency suggestion for something that
might be used to bring about a greater measure of stability in grain prices on the Prairies.
It might be used to bring about a greater
equity among farmers, and I believe it would
afford a sensible possibility of repayment of
cash advances. I suggest that off-site storage
should be provided under the Wheat Board
Act so that storage away from elevator sites
and located on farms may be used for the
storage of grain, and the farmer who owns
the grain at the time of sale would be able to
obtain a sale to the Wheat Board for that
grain. Fabulous sums of money are paid by
the Canadian Wheat Board for storage, one
cent a bushel a month. I am sure excellent
off-site storage could be provided for half the
rate now paid the elevator companies. Farmers would be delighted to get a moderate
.amount of storage and be able to obtain a
'reasonable return for their grain.
Honourable senators acquainted with business in this country know that almost every
industry goes through cycles. There are cycles
for over-production and under-production.
You have cycles of high prices followed by
low prices. I think we are in this kind of a
cycle with agriculture and grain, and we have
seen it before. We are in a period of surplus
and low prices. I think the grain that is in
storage on the Prairies should and could be
considered a national asset for Canada. We
should declare it as such and bring it into
the storage facilities of the Canadian Wheat
Board, stabilize its price and stop this kind of
parasitic dealing in farm grain prices to the
detriment of the producer. This would be a
kind of inventory from which Canada would
obtain a great benefit in the future.
The wheat producers a few years ago were
one of the best contributors in the world to
our balance of payments situation. There is
no point in this nation standing idly by while
hundreds or tens of thousands of farmers go
into bankruptcy, give away their surplus
grain and wreck the livestock industry by
overproduction, only for the country to find
out two or three years from now that we
need greater grain production and greater
production on the Prairies. I put this forward
as a sensible thing to do in my opinion. It
would make it possible for the farmers to
repay their cash advances.
I feel that when a farmer takes a cash
advance it should be on a particular bushel of
[Hon. Mr. Argue.]

November 5, 1969

wheat he has, and the Wheat Board should be
prepared at some future date to relieve him
of that bushel of wheat and pay him for it, as
well as allow him to repay the cash advance.
They have the farmers today in an absolutely
impossible situation. When he is unable to
pay his cash advance and is in arrears he is
going to get a bad name all across Canada.
People are going to say that they are dishonest, and have their hands in the pockets of
the treasury. My suggestion is reasonable in
that it would not increase the price of grains
to the Wheat Board and it would put some
badly needed money into the pockets of the
farmers.
The suggestion I am putting forward is
that there should be an amendment to the
Canadian Wheat Board Act, whereby it would
provide for off-site storage which means
storage on farms. It should also provide
for the payment of storage to farmers of
at least half of the present storage rate paid
to elevator companies. In my opinion, this
kind of a progran deserves consideration,
particularly for the reasons that I now state.
First, it would have the effect of placing
cash in the farmers' hands right now. It
would ensure the security for moneys paid by
the Canadian Wheat Board under the cash
advance program today. It would improve the
security of the Canadian Wheat Board for
these cash advances and restore stability to
the general price level of grains, because
farmers then would not be forced to take 25
cents per bushel for oats if they could get,
under this kind of assistance, payment of the
Wheat Board's initial payment. It would
reveal to the Canadian Wheat Board the
kinds of grain that are available in the country and the quantities in which they are
available, as well as reveal to the Canadian
Wheat Board the position of these grains. The
Wheat Board would be in a position to call
them out whenever they were required. This
would also remove economic discrimination
accompanying present inequitable quotas and
the present uneven box car distribution.
I think the people on the Prairies are good
Canadian citizens and are highly productive.
They have been improving their efficiency
and are willing to take advice and direction,
but they want a chance to pay their debts and
a chance to make a living. They do not like
being placed at the mercy of people who are
now taking advantage of them.

SENATE DEBATES

Last fall I spent about one week at Fort
Churchill, where I met a number of the key
personnel from the research station as well
as some members of the Department of
Public Works and some key personnel of Pan
American Airways who were responsible for
much of the missile program planning. Just a
few weeks ago I was back at Fort Churchill
again, having talks with various officials and
scientists-both those I had met previously
and others, and at that time, so far as I know,
no one had heard of any phasing-out
program.
It was most stimulating to listen to the
scientists, electronic engineers and other specially trained persons. They tried to explain
to me some of the work they were doing,
pointing out some of the changes they had
made in existing machinery and in rebuilding
some equipment or making other changes
that would improve their work. One could see
the pride they had in their work. I am sure
any business organization would be delighted
to have a staff that took as much pride in
their work as these people did.
It is most regrettable that the Government's
austerity program seems to be aimed at
people whose work is favourably known outside Canada. I heard of the work these people
were doing when I was in the United States
last fall, and again when I was in Europe
with the Science Policy Committee a few
weeks ago. One of the European scientists
said that Canada should be proud of the work
its scientists and scientific engineers were
accomplishing.
What is going to happen to these trained
men when Fort Churchill is partially or completely phased out? Where are they going to
find work? Does it mean that they must go to
the United States or some other country, and
these trained
will lose

specialists?
Let us consider what will happen to the
town of Fort Churchill and the town of Churchill, when many of the 400 people employed
on this project are let out. Many-I think the
majori'y-are married men with young families. Their purchasing power means much to
the economy of the area. Fort Churchill has
good schools, a well-equipped hospital, several
stores, a bank and a post office. Surely something can be done to save the situation.
I have been told that the research station is
the only one of its kind in North America,
and that no place in the world is as well
situated to study scientifically the aurora
borealis, which has baffied the world for so
long.

I feel that the Government should be asked
to take another look to see if savings could be
made elsewhere, provided of course that this
scientific study is worthwhile. I have been
told by scientists and engineers who are not
from Fort Churchill that this study has been
a most rewarding and a most beneficial work.
I thank you, honourable senators.
Hon. J. Harper Prowse: Honourable senators, I should like to congratulate Senator
Desruisseaux and Senator Everett for moving
and seconding the Address in Reply to the
Speech from the Throne, and all of those who
have taken part in the debate. It is not my
intention to go into the Speech in great detail,
for reasons which will become apparent in a
moment; nor is it my intention to add to the
growing list of suggestions as to how we
could solve all our problems, if we could just
get enough subsidies to enough people so that
everybody could live well without having to
work or pay taxes.
I had the opportunity in the fifteen years I
was in the Alberta Legislature to listen to
about eighteen Throne Speeches read there.
During that period I was responsible for
answering them, most of the time as Leader
of the Opposition. I learned then that there
are rules about Throne Speeches. The first
rule is that they should never contain anything specific; the second rule is that they
should express in as good English as possible
-or here in a good French and English as
possible-our most pious hopes. And this
Speech does that well.
I do not think it is fair, or would be fair for
me or anybody else, to criticize the Government for having expressed the pious hopes of
the things they intend to achieve, because
after all that is all a Speech from the Throne
is expected to do. But I shall watch with
interest, as will all of us, the legislative program brought forward that in detail will try
to translate the pious hopes, which we read
here, into the kind of legislative action and
the kind of economic and social realities the
country needs.
The value of the Speech from the Government's point of view is that it allows the
Government to assign priorities to the many
problems with which it is faced. The value of
the debate is that it gives all members of both
Houses of Parliament an opportunity to discuss in some detail the particular things
which to them appear important, and to
advise the Government of the priorities and
courses of action it should take.

SENATE DEBATES
My reason for speaking is that I hope what
I will have to say may in some way be of
value to the Government in its efforts to
make this country a better place to live in
and to give some practical legislative effect to
the expressed wishes of the people.
In these days it is fashionable to speak of
governmental actions and social phenomena
in terms of gaps. Because we are so dependent for our information on the overflow from
the mass media in the United States, we are
familiar with such terms as the credibility
gap, which finally led to the resignation of
President Johnson in the United States, the
missile gap, which has led to all kinds of
things, and the generation gap, which leaves
most of us of our age completely confused.
While the list of gaps seems to be inexhaustible there is no doubt about their importance.
In Canada where we have our direct and
prime responsibility we have some gaps of
our own. We have an understanding gap
between those who were brought up in
French-speaking homes and those who were
brought up in other homes in this country.
We have an understanding gap between those
who want higher wages and those who want
lower prices, even though often it is the same
person. We have an understanding gap
between those who live in different parts of
the country. Let me suggest to you that all
these gaps really have one single element of
importance to each of us as legislators. It is
that, like warning lights, they merely indicate
to us the areas which ought to receive
immediate attention.
The appearance of a gap is like the flashing
of what is called the "idiot light" on the
instrument panel of the modern automobile. I
can remember and so can most of us here
when an automobile had on its instrument
panel an oil-pressure gauge that actually told
in pounds per square inch what the oil pressure was. You could simply look at it and see
whether your pressure was high or low. You
had an ammeter which would tell you how
many watts or ohms the generator was charging or discharging. You had a temperature
gauge which told you in degrees how hot
your motor was running. But modern technology did not trust us. Technologists felt that
it was a little ridiculous to leave to ordinary
people such as ourselves the responsibility of
deciding whether the oil pressure was high
enough, whether the generator was charging
sufficiently, or whether the motor was running hot enough. So they took out those
instruments and put in a little blind light. By
[Hon. Mr. Prowse.]

November 5, 1969

that I mean a light that does not ordinarily
show, but if the oil suddenly gets too low and
the pressure drops, on comes a red light with
the word "oil" in the middle of it. This is not
too hard to understand. And if something
goes wrong with the generator, on comes
another red light that says "generator". And
if the motor gets too hot, on comes another
red light which says "hot". These lights are
referred to in the trade as "idiot lights", I
presume because even an idiot knows what
they are supposed to tell us and so we get the
message.
It seems to me that in these days in our own
society we have idiot lights, and that is all we
have. In the old days of the oil-pressure
gauge you could look at the gauge and see
how it was functioning, and if the pressure
was going down it gave you a chance to
correct the situation before any damage was
done. You could also see how the temperature
was running, and if it was getting too hot you
could stop for a while and let your motor cool
instead of just travelling on and having the
situation brought to your attention when it
was too late to do anything about it.
Unfortunately, nowadays we get our warning signals in our society after the event, and
nobody bas been able to devise an ammeter,
oil-pressure gauge, temperature gauge or
thermometer which will tell us when we are
getting into trouble. And it seems to me,
honourable senators, that we are in trouble.
We can see the areas of trouble. We have the
economic area, and there we know we are in
trouble because today nobody's income is sufficient to meet his output. Prices seem to keep
going up faster than you can get your hands
on money to pay your bills. There are many
theories as to why this should happen but
nobody has come up with any kind of solid
cure for it yet.
We have social problems in that people
living in one part of the country just do not
have any kind of economic opportunities,
while people living in other parts of the country or in other segments of society do not
seem to be able to handle all the opportunities they have. We have our disadvantaged
areas and our disadvantaged people.
We have the problem caused by the different set of values which the young people
today seem to have compared with the set of
values which our generation thought were
based on some kind of eternal truth.
Of course, honourable senators, we have
had economic difficulties before. With one or
two exceptions we are all old enough to
remember the depression. After we had come

November 5, 1969

SENATE DEBATES

out of it we were satisfied that, had the economic theories of Lord Keynes and one or
two others been known to us beforehand, we
would probably have never got into the
depression in the first place. We figured that
all it took was the application of a few economic principles to the management of our
econony and we would have no problems.
And so we came on with confidence.
Certainly after the war we came through a
period when we thought we might be going to
have another depression. However, we did not
have one and we figured everything in the
garden was lovely, that from here on it was
going to be the Garden of Eden and the only
thing that was going to happen was that the
colours would become more beautiful as the
world grew older. But, all of a sudden, as
Oscar Wilde said, "the tune went false." And
what we have today is runaway inflation.
Great sections of our people are beginning to
be afraid, not just that their income may not
be sufficient tomorrow to look after themselves and their families but that they may
not even have a job. Technology, which was
to be man's instrument and slave, has begun
to appear as the competitor of ordinary
people for jobs-not as man's assistant, mind
you, but his competitor. The result is that
today we begin to wonder if we are the
master of the machine or if we have become
the slave of our own technology and of
machines.
Can it be that we sentient human beings,
the finest handiwork of the Almighty Craftsman, have become the slaves of our own
creations? And if this is not the warning light
that says, "hot" or "boiling" or plain trouble,
clearly enough for anyone to see, then I do
not know what is.
How have we been trying to meet these
problems? We have been using the conventional wisdom of the conventional economists.
Let me tell you that nothing John Stuart Mill
told us helped us to get out of the depression,
and it is pretty obvious, now we have been
applying the Keynesian school of economics,
backed up by Galbraith and Friedman, that
we are not doing much better.
I suggest to you in all seriousness that the
laws of economics have changed from time to
time. There is only one thing that bas
remained the same. When the professor
explained the law to us he always prefaced
his remarks by saying, "Other things being
constant, if 'A' happens then 'B' will tend to
follow." Remember? The only thing that has
remained the same is that other things never

remain constant, and just as we started to
fight World War II on the basis of World War
I experience, so we are today trying to cope
with the problems of the seventies with a
wisdom that is based on an analysis of the
problems of the thirties. We can expect some
great disappointments before we find the
answers. That is economics.
I suggest this is something a Senate committee might care to take on. Cabinet ministers are too busy to take it on, so a body such
as ours should. However, be that as it may,
we are going to need new solutions for new
problems, because we have never been able in
the history of mankind to solve new problems
with old solutions. I think that is why we are
in trouble today.
People wonder why costs are up. When I
walk down the street and see an institution
offering me 8a per cent interest on my savings,
guaranteed without risk, surely there is the
answer? I do not have any money to deposit;
all I am looking for is somewhere to borrow
money at a reasonable rate. I figure that if it
costs them that much, then at 10t, 11j
or 12 per cent, Prowse, you are beaten before
you start. If we are paying 12 per cent for
capital, if our businessmen are paying 12 per
cent for operating capital and 12 per cent or
more for their risk capital, and this is all
added to by everyone who takes his bite on
top of it all, then why should we be surprised
if prices are high? How could they be anything else?
The biggest mistake this house ever madeand let us not blame anyone else-was when
we sat here quietly and let people convince us
that if we just took the 6 per cent interest
ceiling off the bank rate, then interest rates
would go down, that if we tied the interest
rates to the demand for capital we would put
the whole country on the move. What rubbish! So much for economics.
The next problem we have is social. It used
to be the idea that a man could get a job by
which he could make a decent living and
keep his family in respectable poverty. That
was all that was expected of him, and that
was all society was expected to do, to provide
him with that kind of opportunity. If you
mention poverty even to the fellow on relief
today, he immediately becomes a problem
that has to be solved and is not something
you have taken care of. Ordinary working
wages have reached a point today where
maybe they have some value, because the
ordinary labourer has become aware that
taxes are tough to pay on his reasonably high
income.

will have a greater amount of unemployment
for every percentage point drop in our cost of
living than they will experience in the United
States. I will have to accept that figure. I do
not know how they arrived at it in the first
place, but it sounds all right.
The man who is unemployed does not care
what wage rates are; he does not care what
incomes are, and he does not care what tax
rates are. If we let too many of our people
become unemployed because we think that by
so doing we may benefit one sector of the
community by reducing prices, we can easily
create a situation in which many people in
this country, every one of them with a vote,
will not care. So, I say that socially we have a
tremendous responsibility to see that the
maximum number of people are kept
working.
We are not going to solve this problem with
any kind of formula someone offers us,
whether it is the guaranteed annual income
or whatever you want to call it. I say that
because human beings are people, people are
animals, and animals have behaviour patterns, and one of the things a man needs is
the feeling that he is necessary. We have not
yet come up with a religion, even, that has
convinced people that they make themselves
necessary by accepting what others give.
Basically, and fortunately for us, it is still
important to a man's vision and image of
himself that he should be able to say, "This I
have done with my two hands. This I have
created. This I have learned. This I have
bought. This is mine." And the moment we
lose sight of that, then watch for the idiot
light, because if we take away from a man
his respect, if we leave him with only his
needs, then his needs are endless.
When I was married in 1937 I was earning
$75 a month. The only difference between
then and now-my wife and I have discussed
this many times-is that now there are more
things we want and cannot have, and they all
cost more. I was certainly fortunate at that
time, because I had a job while many people
did not. The one thing I have learned is that
every time I am able to improve my economic
position, or my command over goods and services, I need more. For instance, if I buy a
boat, I need a motor for it. Then I have to
buy fuel to run it. I have to buy life jackets,
[Hon. Mr. Prowse.]

November 5, 1969

and I have to fit the boat with lights so that I
can run it at night. Then I have to get a
licence for it. It seems that the more one gets,
the more one needs. If we create a class of
society that is contributing nothing except its
ability to consume, then it will consume
us all.
When we are looking at social problems we
should not be talking about alleviating poverty, but of giving men back their manhood.
The man who is out of work living in a
ghetto in the city, and the native who has
never been off the reserve in northern
Canada, have one thing in common, and you
cannot translate it into bucks. They want to
be proud of "me".
Honourable senators, I come now to the
younger generation. This country was populated by people who came here because they
hoped that in this country they would find
the kind of opportunities for their children
that they had never known in the lands from
which they came. Speaking for myself, I
thought we were doing pretty well. We have
a good school system. We have universities,
and we have technical schools, and we have
all kinds of training programs. I think it is
true to say in Canada today that we have
created a situation where any young person,
by just showing an interest, can get as much
education as he can use. What happens? They
burn the computer. They do not like it; they
do not want it. Perhaps they are not the ones
who lit the match, but they sympathize with
those who did. They say, "Maybe they had a
good reason."
Honourable senators, we cannot blame
them. If their sense of values is not the same
as ours, then there is only one place where
the fault lies. Human beings are strange animals. It takes us fifteen or sixteen years to
reach maturity, or the point where we can
look after ourselves. For the first sixteen
years of our lives we have to be looked after.
In a basic, normal life children are brought
up in close contact with their parents. Fathers
teach their sons how to hunt, and mothers
teach their daughters how to keep house, to
tan skins, to make beds, and do the things
they are supposed to do. But, we were so
damned busy in the last thirty years enjoying
our prosperity that we did not even bother to
see that we had decent teachers and
housekeepers to look after our children and to
train them. If our young people have grown
up with no respect for our sense of values,
then let us not blame them. Let us accept the
responsibility which must be ours.

REPORTS OF COMMITTEE PRESENTED

Hon. Arthur W. Roebuck, Chairman of

inclusive, and moved that the said reports
be taken into consideration at the next sitting.

November 6, 1969

"84. (1) A select committee of the
Senate shall, within thirty days of the
final accounting of any special expenses
incurred in connection with its work,
report the same to the Senate in reasonable detail.
(2) If the Senate is not sitting at the

said report shall be made within fifteen
days of the resumption of its sittings and
if the sittings have been interrupted
within such period by a prorogation or

shall be made within fifteen days of the
commencement of the next ensuing
session.
(3) In addition to the final report
referred to in sub-rules (1) and (2),
within fifteen days of the commencement
of each session, a select committee of the
Senate shall make an interim report of
any special expenses incurred by it
during the preceding session which have
been accounted for, together with an estimate of any such expenses not yet
accounted for.
(4) Any such final or interim report
shall be laid on the table by or on behalf
of the chairman of the select committee

SENATE DEBATES

come out with a rule which is already out of
date. That is the only reason for what might
appear to be unseemly haste.
As to the change of Rule 84, some of you
will remember that I made a report on behalf
of the special committee on the amount of
money it had expended in its work last year.
To do so, we had to reconstitute the committee for one sitting only of the Senate, because
we could not very well submit our report
when
the
committee
did
not
exist
owing to prorogation. With the help of the
Clerk of the Senate and the Law Clerk, the
committee bas tried to provide in this amended rule a method of reporting the expenses
incurred by committees that are specifically
authorized to incur expenses, at the end of
the session or at the beginning of a subsequent session, regardless of whether that
committee had ceased to function by virtue of
a prorogation or otherwise. In other words,
we have to amend the rule to make it possible to report on the finances of the committee
concerned, regardless of what had happened
in the interim.
As a second point, every committee which
is authorized to incur expenses-and most
special committees are-will have to report
at least once in each session, on the
expenses which have been incurred. We think
this is desirable. Honourable senators appreciate that we have had committees which have
continued for as long as five or six years-I
think this was so in the case of the Special
Committee on Land Use-and it would have
been rather futile to report the expenses of
such a committee after it had run for six
years.
Honourable senators, I think this amendment is worthwhile. It bas been 'agreed to and
bas the support of the committee, and I trust
that it will be given approval by the chamber.
Motion agreed to.

NORTH ATLANTIC ASSEMBLY
FIFTEENTH ANNUAL CONFERENCE
BRUSSELS, BELGIUM-DEBATE
ADJOURNED

AT

Hon. A. Hamilton McDonald rose pursuant
to notice:
That he will call the attention of the
Senate to the Fifteenth Annual Conference of the North Atlantic Assembly,
held at Brussels, Belgium, 16th to 21st
October, 1969, and in particular to the
discussions and the proceedings of the
Conference and the participation therein
of the delegation from Canada, and to the
visit of the delegation from Canada to
NATO Bases in Europe.
He said: Honourable senators, in rising to
speak on the subject of the Fifteenth Annual
Conference of the North Atlantic Assembly
held in Brussels, Belgium, from October 16 to
21, 1969, and, in particular, the discussions
and proceedings of the Conference and the
participation therein of the delegation fron
Canada, and the visit of the delegation from
Canada to NATO bases in Europe, it is my
intention this afternoon to give a brief report
to the bouse on the three particular trips that
it was my privilege to take over the last few
months.

SENATE DEBATES
First, I would refer to the trip that I, with
three members of the other place, made to
NATO bases in Europe from September 1 to
14 last; second, I wish to report on the meeting of the North Atlantic Assembly held in
Brussels from October 16 to 21, and, third, I
shall report on my trip to West Berlin as a
guest of the West German Government from
October 22 to 25. I shall also have a few remarks regarding a side trip I took on my own
to East Berlin for a short period.
On September 1 we arrived in Brussels and
were informed that the Belgian Air Force had
made a DC-6 aircraft available to the delegales who were to tour European bases of
NATO. I wish at this time to express my
thanks, and I am sure that of all the Canadian delegates, to the Belgian Government for
this courtesy in that it made easy for us to
cover a very large area of Europe in a short
space of time. As a matter of fact, we covered
some six countries in 14 days. The arrangements that were laid on by the Belgian Air
Force were exceedingly proficient, and we
express our thanks to them.
When we first arrived in Belgium we were
met by the Secretary General of NATO, Mr.
at the Assembly
Philippe Deshormes,
Secretariat Headquarters in Brussels. He gave
us a short briefing with respect to the areas
of Europe that we would be visiting and the
facilities that had been put at our disposal.
We also met there the two conducting officers, Colonel Cochrane from the United States
Air Force and Commander Laturner from the
German Navy. Again I want to express our
gratitude and thanks to Mr. Deshormes and to
the two conducting officers for the arrangements and the management of our tour. No
tour could have been better arranged; we
could not have asked for better facilities. All
in all, it was an exceptionally good show.
Many people had put in a great deal of work
and effort to make sure that we saw everything there was to be seen in a short period
of time and that our comforts were taken
care of.
In the afternoon of September 1 we proceeded to Casteau, near Mons-I know that
will bring back many memories to some of
the returned veterans of World War 1.
'SHAPE Headquarters are located outside of
Casteau. These are the new headquarters
built after the French Government requested
that NATO Headquarters and forces should
leave France. The new headquarters are
located on what was a small civilian aerodrome on some very low-lying, swampy land
[Hon. Mr. McDonald.1

November 6, 1969

behind the aerodrome. In a matter of about
six months the allied forces went in, drained
the swamp, put in fill and built ail the new
buildings. They have, in my view, provided
an excellent headquarters for SHAPE.
This also serves as the headquarters of
SACEUR, the Supreme Allied Commander in
Europe, General Goodpaster. During the
tour of the facilities at SHAPE we were
briefed by General Goodpaster's number 2
man, General Bray, a general in the United
Kingdom army. The arrangements of the tour
were excellent in another sense in that we
started our tour at NATO Headquarters and
then went to SHAPE and then on to the
divisions-central, northern and southern
divisions-and then into the field. So, we had
a general review from the top structure right
down to the men in the field who would do
the fighting, if fighting were necessary.
From SHAPE Headquarters and SACEUR
we went to the Allied Forces Supreme European Headquarters in Brunssum. Again we
were given a tour of the facilities, and in the
afternoon we travelled a short distance from
Brunssum to Glons to inspect the NADGE
Training Centre. I do not know exactly what
the letters NADGE stand for, but the centre is
used to train people from all NATO countries,
including France, to operate an early warning
system for supersonic aircraft. In this modern
age the supersonic aircraft has revolutionized
the methods that must be used to give any
warning at all of low-level or even high-level
attacks.
I repeat that France was taking part in that
program with other NATO countries in its
cost, training and facilities. This is NATO's
answer to an early warning system in
Europe. Any of you who have seen the film
now showing in Ottawa and other cities, "The
Battle of Britain", will have seen some of the
first radar facilities available back in 1940,
and if you had the opportunity to visit
NADGE today you would see the tremendous
advances made in radar. Without this system,
NATO members are convinced they would
have no warning at all, especially of low-flying aircraft.
On September 3 we proceeded from the
Central Army Group down to Heidelberg, to
CENTAG. There we met United States Army
General Polk, who is in charge of the United
States Army overseas. We were again given a
tour of the facilities. His briefing chiefly
concerned the American ground operations in

November 6, 1969

SENATE DEBATES

On September 4 we proceeded to Grafenwoehr which is a training area. There we were
briefed with regard to the patrols along the
border between West Germany and Czechoslovakia. We had an opportunity of inspecting
the equipment used to patrol the border, and
of looking through a device much like the
conning tower of a submarine, with a periscope which is raised to allow you to look
over to the other side of the border and see
what your colleagues in the Russian and Czechoslovakian armies are doing. It is rather an
eerie feeling, to be at the border and to be
able to look at your potential enemy through
a 'scope that brings him up to within what
seems about 10 or 12 feet. There is constant
surveillance, not only on that part of the
border but right from north to south throughout Europe. We were fortunate to have the
opportunity of seeing this at first hand.
We also visited a firing range where artillery and tanks were practising. The accuracy
and killing power of modern weapons is
almost unbelievable. Many years ago I had
the opportunity of spending a short time in
the artillery. We had old 18-pounders and we
used to be allowed 10 rounds for ranging. If
anyone takes 10 rounds to range now he is a
dead duck, because the American Army on
this occasion showed us that with artillery
the second round is on the target and, in
many instances, so is the first. It is not a
matter of measuring degrees between your
knuckles any more. The artillery and tanks
are controlled by modern electronic equipment, and their accuracy and rapidity of fire
are astonishing. This led me to certain conclusions regarding anyone who wants to
attack central Europe. Perhaps we could not
prevent the Russians penetrating or even conquering Europe, but, they will have an awful
bloody nose if they try it.
The same is true of the tank demonstration
at the training school. The American Tank
Corps comes into this particular training area
twice a year, when the tanks are put through
two exercises, one in daylight and one at
night, and they must have a minimum score,
in order to pass. If they do not pass, they
remain there until they do. The tanks are
brought in by rail and each crew has the tank
it would use in time of war. Again, the speed
and accuracy are unbelievable. With tanks
travelling at some 45 miles an hour, it does
not take long to go from the eastern border of
Germany to the Channel ports. I came to the
conclusion that you cannot back up very far,
because you would have to back up fast with

artillery and tanks moving at 40 to 45 miles
an hour.
In this demonstration of the American
tanks all weapons were used. Each of the
particular tanks we saw was equipped with a
155 millimetre gun, a large calibre machine
gun, and small calibre machine gun. As they,
moved down the road, or the course, there
would be a small explosion that identified the
target off in the distance, and it amazed us to
see how rapidly a tank could lay on to its
target and hit it 99 times out of 100 with the
first shell. The large machine guns use an
anti-personnel bullet which is about the size
of a man's finger. The targets used were
wooden dummies. I do not know how a soldier would survive in the area of firing.
I presume that our potential enemy, Russia,
has similar equipment. I repeat that if there
is ever a conflict, with the non-nuclear weapons that are available today it would be a
holocaust. I shall have something to say about
the nuclear weapons later.
Then on Friday, September 5, we were
taken to Oberammergau to visit a NATO
weapons systems school. We were shown, by
means of projected photographs, the aircraft
that are available to the Soviet Union. There
were not many surprises there. Pretty well al
of their front line aircraft have been referred
to in the daily press of Canada. But, what
staggered one was the number of aircraft
available to the army and navy of the Soviet
Union. Their aircraft are first class, and are
probably as good as any in the world, but the
nuimber that they have is just fantastic. There
are some 7,000 fighters on the borders
between Western and Eastern Europe. When
honourable senators consider that Britain had
during the Battle of Britain only 600 fighters,
they can imagine what would be going on in
the sky if war ever broke out in Europe
today.
The Soviet navy is something new. During
the Second World War, and for a long period
after, the Russians had virtu-ally no navy.
They had some small ships that were used
chiefly for coastal work, and they very
seldom ventured out into the oceans of the
world. Today they have probably the second
greatest navy in the world. They have some
360 submarines-about four times as many as
Nazi Germany had when war was declared in
1939. These submarines are concentrated in
three areas-the North Atlantic, the Baltie,
and the Mediterranean. Many of them are
nuclear powered. Many of them have a missile launching capability. In my opinion, the

SENATE DEBATES
Russians have what is probably the greatest
submarine navy in the world today.
The Soviet Union graduates about 900
marine design engineers and naval architects
each year, which is substantially more than
any other country in the world. The Soviet
oceanographic research fleet is larger than all
the rest of the world's oceanographic fleets
put together. In addition to that, the Soviet
fishing fleet is the largest in the world. It has
up to date equipment, such as the most
recently designed fishing factory ships carrying 40 to 50 ton vessels, which could be
replaced by landing craft in the event of war.
The Soviet merchant fleet comprises a
greater percentage of modern ships than the
modern fleets of the west. Among them are
about 80 large-hatch ships which could easily
bo adapted for military transports, merchant
marine tankers and for other uses during
wartime. This is new; the Russian navy has
been built almost completely in the last 20
years. This brings a new threat to the western world. I can see very little defence potential against the present Russian navy in its
activities today. They are in the Mediterranean, the Atlantic Ocean, the Pacific Ocean,
and as a matter of fact they are at the moment
the second largest fleet afloat. If they continue
the building program they have been carrying
on over the last few years, it is only a matter
of time until they will be the greatest sea
power on earth. I repeat that I do not believe
that this sea power is being built to defend
the Soviet Union.
The thing that interested me most at this
NATO weapons briefing was the equipment
that is available to the allied forces. Again, I
presume that the Russians have similar
equipment and the potential to fight a nuclear
war without getting into holocaust in which
you would shoot missiles from one continent
to another. I am convinced that the western
powers cannot prevent the Soviet Union from
over-runnming Europe with conventional weapons. There are 20 divisions on our side stationed in Europe, with 80 divisions across the
border facing them. We are told by the
authorities that their divisions are not as well
trained and equipped as ours, but they do
admit that we are outnumbered virtually
three to one. Nobody can tell me that with
the modern killing power of conventional
weapons one tank can stop three tanks or one
man can stop three men. I do not believe it is
possible, and I am convinced that if the Russians attacked central Europe it would be
only a matter of hours, days at the most, until
[Hon. Mr. McDonald.]

November 6, 1969

some type of nuclear weapon would have to
be used or else you give up the ghost.
I mentioned a moment ago that you do not
have much territory to give up. Look at the
map of western Europe. There is Norway,
Belgium, Denmark, Holland, West Germany,
France, Italy, Greece and Turkey. If 80 divisions struck into central Europe, I suggest you
would be back into the English Channel
before you knew what had happened to you.
I am convinced that nuclear weapons can
be used without getting into a holocaust. That
is the reason the western powers have adopted a procedure known as flexible or appropriate response. It is possible to fire a nuclear
device, for instance, from a 155 millimetre
gun, from a tank or from an artillery piece.
It is possible to lay nuclear land mines and to
warn the potential aggressor: If you come
beyond a certain point you will explode the
nuclear weapon, not I. In other words, the
capability of these small nuclear weapons with
which you have some control over the area
that would be affected is the only deterrent to
the Soviet Union in central Europe today. I
believe that if the Russians attack in Europe
these weapons will have to be used. It is my
hope that the potential aggressor would be
told in advance that if he proceeded beyond a
certain line this would be the consequence. Of
course, if they proceeded beyond that, then I
suppose the end result would bo a nuclear
holocaust. I cannot believe that the Soviet
Union, or any other major power, would be
prepared to pay the price that they would
have to pay as a consequence of detonating a
nuclear weapon. I think it is the deterrent.
I would hate to see the day that any power
would knowingly explode even one of these
smaller nuclear weapons, knowing full well
that it would be followed by such terrible
weapons of destruction as the Honest John,
the Sergeant and the Pershing. That would be
the end of mankind.
I wish to refer to a speech made by Senator
Aird in this chamber on December 17 last. At
page 782, he said:
-As
Canada's distinguished former
Prime Minister, Lester Pearson, pointed
out during his current series of Reith
Lectures over the BBC, the strength of
NATO's conventional forces would not be
sufficient to resist for long an attack by
the much more numerous conventional
forces of the Warsaw Pact nations. I
quote from Mr. Pearson's words:

November 6, 1969

They were concerned over what role they
against aggression from eastern Europe, would be playing in the future. However,
it could not do so successfully at present they told us plainly that it was not their

From Northwood we went to Naples and
had the privilege of visiting AF South, which
is the headquarters of South Command.
They are responsible, of course, for the
protection of Italy, Greece and Turkey.
They are also responsible for the Mediterranean. One of their great worries is the
ever-increasing presence in some strength of
Russian vessels in the Mediterranean. We had
an indication of the co-operation of France
with NATO on the day we were there, in that
we were shown on their charts where the
French air force was shadowing a Russian
flotilla coming through the channel and heading for the Mediterranean.
While there we also had an opportunity
to visit Salerno and see the beaches where
the landings took place, and where the battles
were fought around Salerno. The following
day we flew from Naples to the Defence College at Rome. On the way we were shown
Monte Casino, which you all know played
such a prominent role during the campaign in
Italy. We only saw Monte Casino from the
air, but it has been rebuilt. One can quite
understand why it had to be destroyed during
the last world war.
I have almost concluded my remarks on our
tour, but I should like to take this opportunity
to thank the Senate and the Leader of the
Government in the Senate for the opportunity
to take the trip to NATO bases prior to the
meetings in Brussels. Without having had this
field trip, the meetings in Brussels would
have been almost meaningless to one attending them for the first time.
I now turn to the meeting of the North
Atlantic Assembly in Brussels, which took
place in the Belgium Senate from October 16
to 21. This being the twentieth anniversary of
NATO, two things were going on at virtually
the same time. One was a review of what
NATO had been able to do over the past 20
years, and the other was a concern about
where we go from here.
Let us for a moment review what NATO
has been able to do over the past 20 years. To
do that, we must look at what happened in
Europe prior to NATO coming into being.
Most of us have very short memories. We
forget, for instance, that the Soviet Union was
the only power who fought in the Second
World War and came out of it with territorial
gains. Sometimes we forget that. Prior to
NATO being set up, what happened?
[Hon. Mr. McDonald.]

November 6, 1969

Back in 1940 there were three areas of
Finland that were not just occupied but were
taken into the Soviet Union. In addition,
Estonia disappeared into the Soviet Union,
Latvia disappeared into the Soviet Union,
Lithuania disappeared into the Soviet Union.
Then in 1945 part of East Prussia disappeared
into the Soviet Union; also in 1945, part of
Poland, part of Czechoslovakia and part of
Romania. As a matter of fact, from 1940 to
1945 some 183,000 square miles of European
territory disappeared inside the Soviet Union,
involving 24 million people. Following that,
from 1945 to 1948 the U.S.S.R. took control of
the Soviet zone of Germany, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Romania, Hungary, Bulgaria and
Albania-another 394,000 square miles and
almost 92 million people.
This all happened during and following the
war, until NATO came into being. They have
made no further advances in Europe since
NATO came into being. Certainly they have
caused some problems in areas they had
occupied prior to 1948. The most recent case
was their march into Czechoslovakia just over
a year ago. So there can be no doubt in
anyone's mind that NATO has been effective
in stopping the spread of the Soviet Union
throughout Europe.
Before I go into the details of our meetings
in Brussels I would take this opportunity of
thanking those people responsible for the
briefings we received prior to leaving Canada.
When one attends a meeting of this nature,
on the first occasion you are placed in a difficult position because of the fact that many
people attending have been there for perhaps
10 or 15 years. On many occasions when I
have had the opportunity to go abroad the
briefings at home were not of sufficient value.
That was not the case before departing on
our trip to Brussels. The briefings by the
External and Defence Departments were
excellent, and they were followed up by
briefings on arrival in Brussels from the
Canadian Ambassador, Ross Campbell and
Peter Dobell. Without those briefings, I repeat
that our understanding of the problems of the
day and our contribution to the Assembly
would have been much less.
Coming to the contribution that the Canadian delegations made to the Assembly, I think
Mr. Alastair Gillespie, the head of the Canadian delegation, summed it up in his speech

than I could. I hope you will give me your
indulgence, because I want to read at con-

siderable length from the main address by
Mr. Gillespie, the head of the Canadian
delegationHon. Mr. Martin: And a member of the
other house.
Hon. Mr. McDonald: That is right, he is a
member of the other house.
In his presentation to the Assembly, Mr.
Gillespie brought to our attention several
matters that I think were the first and foremost concerns of not only Canada, but most
of the delegates from virtually every country
present at the meetings. Mr. Gillespie said:
Over the past 20 years a new generation has grown up in the sunlight of a
European peace. It bas done so alongside
the shadows of Russian aggressive intention, and it has done so well knowing the
awful alternative. Yet there are signs
today that this generation does not
embrace NATO the custodian of this
peace. In North America this may be
partly a matter of distance, partly of
other continental preoccupations, partly
other world preoccupations. In Europe
one wonders whether the young have
taken peace for granted and their leaders
the status quo for granted. Perhaps the
very success of NATO may prove its
greatest liability.

build-up of the Russian navy. I repeat, the
Russian navy is not a threat to central
Europe, but to many other parts of the world
they pose a threat which did not exist until
this huge navy came into being.
Next, he pointed out the threat of the withdrawal of forces from NATO by other countries. His warning was not only because
Canada had reduced her forces in Europe, but
that other countries were talking of doing the
same thing. At this point, I would
refer to a letter to the editor of one of the
London newspapers, written by a Conservative M.P., Mr. Geoffrey Rippon, Q.C., for
Hexham. He writes of the speech of the Minister of Defence of Great Britain as follows:
Mr. Denis Healey's speech at the North
Atlantic Assembly meeting in Brussels
underlines the need for an urgent reappraisal of NATO policy and strategy.
I do not believe that the United States
will abandon its allies or its responsibilities and commitments. But we, and the
rest of Europe, have got to be prepared to
shoulder a fairer share of the burden.
We are living in a fool's paradise if we
think the Americans
will forever
acquiesce in a situation in which they
have as many men in uniform as all the
nations of Western Europe combined,
although we have a population half again
greater than that of the United States.
We have to create in the 1970s a distinct European defence capabilitynuclear and conventional-that can and
should be an integral part of the defence
of the free world, but which gives an
independent influence to Europe.
Today nuclear escalation is the only
alternative to surrender in Europe in the
event of a major Soviet attack. Mr.
Healey talks about "flexible response"
but this is a meaningless doctrine in present circumstances.

He went on to say:
How do we reach the people and particularly the young? The 40 year olds of
today, who were only 16 in 1945, will
progressively be assuming positions of
leadership and power within their countries. It is their children who will soon
move into the universities, children who
have been scarred by the agonies of Viet
Nam, children who rate morality above

-has affirmed its continuing commitment
to NATO and Europe in emphatic ternis.
Do not be fooled that a reduction in our
European commitment means withdrawal. This is the talk of the faint hearted
and the pessimists. Consider the emerging
importance of the Arctie North and ask
yourself, "Does it not make sense that
Canada should occupy its own frontiers?"
Does it not make sense that Canada
should devote resources to the surveillance of those enormous stretches of land
and sea? Does it not make sense that
Canada should help to protect the U.S.
deterrent over its own lands? Does it not
make sense that Canada should have
forces that are equipped, trained and able
to support a NATO commitment and a
U.N. assignment when called upon to do
so?
He then pointed out at the end of his
speech the geographical position of Canada.
Drawing a line north and south, we lie
between the two great powers of the world,
the Soviet Union and the United States. If we
draw another line from east to west, we see
that we lie between China and our cultural
heritage in Europe. The fact that we do live
in this particular geographical area places us
in a different position perhaps than any other
country in the world.
In conclusion, with regard to our meetings
in Brussels, I am convinced that unless there
is some sort of political unity in Europe, the
Europe that we know today cannot survive.
Yet, how can we have political unity when
they have been striving for years to get some
kind of economic unity in Europe? Some
people seem to resist Britain, as well as other
countries of Europe, entering into the economic community. But if they resist economic
union, how can they attain political union?
I suggest that without political union the
future of Europe is bleak. It is bleak for this
reason. The population of western Europe is
about one and a half times that of the United
States. Although the gross national product of
western Europe increased tremendously from
1945 to 1965-as a matter of fact, it doubledit is now less than half that of the United
States.
In my opinion, the ability of a country to
defend itself depends more on its ability to
produce than on its ability to put soldiers in
the field. The disparity between man-hour
production on the North American continent
[Hon. Mr. MeDonald.]

November 6, 1969

and that in Europe is seven to one. That is,
the man-hour production on the North
American continent is seven times greater
than it is in Europe. One of the reasons for
this, in my opinion, is that there are so many
small, independent countries which are not
united militarily, economically or politically.
It seems to me that Europe can accomplish
the same things as have been accomplished
on the North American Continent, but that
can be donc only through united effort.
Honourable senators, I wish to conclude my
remarks with a few words about the trip to
Berlin on October 22 to 25. Before the war,
Berlin must have been a great city. I did not
have an opportunity of visiting it then, but it
is obvious that a city of 4.5 million people,
which was the population in 1939, and with
the type of people who lived there, had to be
a great city. Even today, the part of Berlin
that survived the last world war-the buildings, the architecture, the parks and the
woods-gives evidence of having been a great
city.
It certainly is not a great city today. I do
not sec how it can be, until some of the
political questions are solved. I have a map
here, but unfortunately it is too small for
honourable senators to sec. Anyone who
wishes to sec it later is welcome to do so. If
you take any city in the world and divide it
by a wall, leaving about 2.3 million people on
one side and 1.1 million on the other side, and
if you stop the free flow of people, goods,
services and everything else from one side of
the city to the other, how can it be a great
city?
No one can appreciate what the Wall is like
unless he sees it. We were taken for a tour
over its whole length. Every few yards we
could see either a cross, a plaque or a wreath
denoting the death of some east German who
tried ta escape to freedom and was shot in
doing so.
West Berlin has been rebuilt. Some people
say it is the western showcase of the world.
West Berlin is no different from any other
city in West Germany, or in the western
world for that matter. The shops are plentiful, the entertainment is as good as one can
find anywhere else. But there is a great problem in West Berlin.
On several occasions since the last war, the
Russians have attempted to chase the allies
out of West Berlin, and they have been
unsuccessful. I am not so sure they are going
to be unsuccessful forever. Why was the
Berlin Wall built in the first place? It was

November 6, 1969

Novemer 6,1969SENATE
DEBATES

built to stop people leaving East Germnany.
There were 60,000 people living in East Germany and employed in West Germany on the
day the Wall went up, August 13, 1961. Those
60,000 were unemployed the next day. The
fact is that the economy of West Germany
was 60,000 workers short. Since the Wall has
gone up, access from east to west has virtually stopped as far as East Berliners going west
are concerned. The only people who can move
across are those 65 years of age and overEast Germnany is glad to get rid of them; they
go to West Berlin to get a bigger pension. As
a resuit, 24 per cent of the population of
West Berlin are over 65, while the average
for the whole of West Germany is 7 per cent.
The population of Berlin has dropped by
over one million. It is flot very pleasant to
live on an island surrounded by barbed wire,
machine guns, tank traps, vehicle traps and
oement. I do not blame West Berliners or East
Berliners for wanting to move out to West
Germany.
In the six months prior to the Wall being
built on August 13, 1961, when they were
sealed off, 103,000 East Germans moved into
West Berlin. But now virtually no one can
move in, unless he is 65 years of age or over.
When a person becomes 65 he is not able to
work in industry, or if he does it is only for a
short period of Urne; he is not able to work in
government or in services for the people. If
the drain of population out of West Berlin
continues, by 1980 there will flot be sufficient
able-bodied people i West Berlin to maintain
goverfiment services and man the industries.
Honourable senators, the Soviet Union
know what they are doing, what they are
trying to accomplish by building this wall
around that city. It is the takeover of the
city. I arn disappointed to see our Government withdraw the military mission from
Berlin. I believe that our military mission in
Berlin, by the very fact that it was there, and
the political significance of it, meant a great
deal to the survival of West Berlin,' and it
will be most difficuit for the people of West
Berlin to survive many years unless some
changes are made in the interval.
Honourable senators, I wish to thank again
the Leader of the Government in the Senate
for the opportunity I had of making the trip
to the NATO bases, attending the Conferenoe
in Brussels, and going to Berlin. If Canadians
are to make their maximum contribution to
the discussions in Brussels from Urne to Urne,
in the North Atlantic Assembly, or wherever
the discussions are held, there should be some

continuity to the Canadian delegation. I do
not say that ail of those who went this year
should go next year, but there is a hard
core wbo should repeat the trip. When
one runs into people like Senator Javîts-who
bas been attending these conferences for
many years-one feels rather small and insignificant. I think Canada can make a better
contribution if we give this continuity to at
least the core of Canada's delegation. I would
ask the Leaders on both sides of the house to
give consideration to my thoughts in this
respect.
Again I thank honourable senators for the
opportunity I had to make this trip.
Hon. George S. White: Honourable senators, I should like to say to the honourable
Senator McDonald that I have listened with
keen interest to his excellent and informative
address on bis trip to NATO bases in Europe.
I congratulate you, honourable senator, on a
very fine report. I think it is an answer to
those who question the value of spending
money and tirne in sending members of ParMient and senators to visit our forces overseas. I hope the comment that you made at
the end of your speech as to the continuity
will carry forward.
After listening to your remarks, I for one
amn more convinced than ever that the policy
of the present Goverrnent in withdrawing
troops from NATO iýs absolutely wrong.
Hon. M. Graitan O'Leary: Honourable
senators, I shail not detain you for more than
a moment with the few words I have to say.
First, I must agree with Senator White that
we have just heard an excellent report. When
I listened to Senator McDonald telling bis
story, I felt that, if I were back in the place I
once occupied in the newspaper world, I
would certainly want to enlist his services as
a reporter.
However, there is one disappointment I
always have when rnembers of the Senate
return from NATO conferences and make
their reports to us. That disappointment is in
the fact that to me they always stress one
part or one obligation of the NATO alliance,
and that is the military alliance.
There is a tremendous lot of confusion
in Canada at the present time following the
announcement of the Government that oui
comrnitments to NATO would be in some way
affected. AI I can say about that is that I amn
not; sure-and I do not know if anybody else
can be sure-that whatever the Goverrnent
intends to do about NATO is being done i

SENATE DEBATES

the right way, at the right time and for the
right reasons. But I do believe that there has
not been sufficient discussion in Canada about
the obligations of NATO that were not military at all. There seems to be a belief that
our present defence expenditure, which
remains around $1,800 million a year, began
with or is in some way due to NATO. That is
not true. Actually, in the year 1949-50, the
year after we joined the NATO alliance, our
total military expenditure was less than $400
million. It was increased only after the war in
Korea, and for reasons that were fairly obvithe Canadian Government
ous. When
announced to Parliament and the country
that it was joining NATO-and most of us
agreed with that-it made it clear at that
time that whatever contribution we made to
NATO in the future as a result of this treaty
would be determined in Canada by Canadi.ans, who themselves would determine the
measure of need.
But what I have risen to say is that at that
time the Canadian Government emphasized
again and again that the NATO treaty was
more than a military alliance. Canada insisted, and I am sure the Leader of the Government remembers this very well-insisted and
emphasized over and over that the treaty
should contain a pledge by every member to
strengihen its free institutions founded on the
principles of democracy, individual liberty
and the rule of law. This undertaking was as
firm and as serious and as binding as the
military undertaking of the treaty.
Every member nation of NATO accepted
that undertaking upon which Canada insisted,
but, alas and unfortunately, no procedure, so
far as I know, was ever devised by the NATO
Council to carry out or have members of the
alliance carry out that undertaking.
We all agree that something should be done
about the defence of Europe. Nobody disagrecs with that. It is a matter of degree; it is
a matter of existing circumstances. But, if we
are going to defend Europe, surely we must
try to find out what it is we are defending.
Are we defending freedom? Are we defending
individual liberty? Are we defending democracy and the rule of law when we undertake
as a member of NATO to defend Portugal
and Greece?
Honourable senators, I repeat that that obligation, that undertaking, was just as binding
and as serious as the military undertaking,
and it hardly lies in the mouth of some Europeans to question our position with respect to
NATO. It certainly does not lie in the mouth
[Hon. Mr. O'Leary.]

November 6, 1969

of Mr. Willy Brandt to come here to tell us
what we should do about the defence of
Europe, and I doubt if it lies in the mouth of
the present Secretary General of NATO. I
must say I resent these things. What I feel
strongly is that our delegations to NATO are
badly briefed. I went on one of those delegations myself, and we were badly briefed. In
fact, not until we sat opposite our American
friends were we able to learn the number of
submarines that Soviet Russia had in the
Mediterranean. I mentioned this once before
in the house. I sat opposite Lord Gladwyn
Jebb and Lady Elliott, for the British. I sat
opposite Senator Javits and the late Robert
Kennedy and Senator Case of New Jersey, for
the Americans. These people were briefed to
the hilt about NATO, and we went there
completely unbriefed. I am not speaking now
of the new regime of Mr. Peter Nobel or
people like that. This is one of the finest
things that has happened, having Mr. Peter
Nobel now briefing our delegations, and I pay
the same tribute to Ross Campbell, who is an
old personal friend of mine.
Hon. Mr. Martin: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. O'Leary: If we are going to go to
these meetings, then let us go there with
information; let us go there able to hold up
our own end intellectually; let us not make
these appointments-and I say this not offensively-just to give some person who voted
the right way or who worked according to the
wishes of the Whip the opportunity of having
a trip.
We cannot have the same people going
to these delegations all the time; that would
be wrong. But there must be a hard core of
leaders just as the Americans have a hard
core and the British have a hard core and,
incidentally, the French. The ablest delegation I found at NATO were the French
people. These people not only spoke their own
language but spoke English so perfectly that
Dean Rusk said one night that be hoped to
God he would live long enough to learn the
English language as well as the French
rapporteurs.
Senator McDonald's excellent report on the
military situation was fascinating to me, but
did the delegation at any time rise to direct
attention to the fact that certain members of
NATO were not carrying out their binding
obligations so far as the military was concerned? I hope some one did. It was not done

November S. 1969

SENATE DEBATES

when I was there and I have read these
reports very, very carefully, and it does not
seem to me that these binding obligations in
the NATO treaty are sufficiently stressed. I
read 25 to 30 newspapers a day; it is my
business to do so. I have read the discussions
that have been going on since the Prime Minister made the NATO announcement, and the
thing that appalls me is the lack of understanding on the part of these writers as to
what NATO is all about. The late Mr. Pearson knew what it was about. We have all
read of the so-called Three Wise Men. But
what is the situation with regard to clause 2?
I think it is clause 2 which deals with the
economic importance of NATO. Has that been
carried out? Or have we heard about the
clause since? I am afraid we did not hear
enough about it.
It is the military aspect that gets ail the
attention. I am not saying that the military
aspect is not important, although I notice that
my good friend did not end up by carrying to
its logical conclusion the implication of what
he was saying in the first place. He told us at
the outset that if nothing was done about
Europe, the Russians were going to devour us,
but then he went on to say that he thought
we were doing the right thing in withdrawing
our military commitments. It is not my intention to discuss that or to criticize it at this
time, but I would hope that when NATO
comes up for discussion in this bouse that
more members would give attention to NATO
as a whole and not merely to the military
organization.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Robichaud, debate

SPEECH FROM THE THRONE
MOTION FOR ADDRESS IN REPLYDEBATE CONTINUED

The Senate resumed from yesterday consideration of His Excellency the Governor General's speech at the opening of the session,
and the motion of Hon. Mr. Desruisseaux,
seconded by Hon. Mr. Everett, for an address
in reply thereto.
Hon. Nelson Raitenbury: Honourable senators, it is a pleasure to join with those who
have already spoken in this debate in offering
warm congratulations to the mover and
seconder of the Address in Reply to the Speech
from the Throne, Senator Desruisseaux and
Senator Everett. Both acquitted themselves in
admirable fashion.
Let me offer also my respect and al good
wishes to the Honourable the Speaker, the
Leader of the Government, and the Leader of
the Opposition, as they undertake their
respective and onerous duties in this new session of Parliament.
My best wishes for health and happiness
are extended to each and every honourable
senator as we settle down to the heavy
schedule of important work that was previewed for us in the Throne Speech.
In the Throne Speech debate, several
honourable senators have referred with eloquence and deep feeling to world problems, to
wars and threats of war, to human deprivation, starvation, illness and other causes of
international concern. They have suggested

SENATE DEBATES
ways and means through which the social
conscience of Canadians may participate in
bringing solutions to these dreadful human
problems throughout our global village.
I subscribe fully to all of those proposals
and my words could add but little to them.
Sufficient to say that since our organization as
a nation, Canadians have, in the context of
any particular era in human relations, in both
war and peace, discharged their responsibilities with honour. There is no doubt in my
mind that we shall continue to do so even in
this ever-shrinking world, where advanced
communications and transportation make the
Vietnamese, the Israeli, the Arab and the
African, our next-door neighbors.
In strictly North American terms, the problems being experienced within our own
nation appear great and pressing-poverty,
pollution, regional economic disparity, urban
blight, housing shortages, inequitable taxation, civil unrest, grain surpluses and low
farm incomes, to mention a few.
Without question, we do have these and
other complex problems. Yet, in order that
we keep them in perspective and not lose
heart in seeking solutions, we should always
remember that nearly every nation on earth
would gladly accept all of our problems, if, at
the same time, they could acquire our great
natural wealth, our advanced social and economic structure and our truly exceptional
living standards.
Honourable senators, it is from this latter
viewpoint that I would like to discuss two of
the problem areas raised in the Throne
Speech, namely, regional economic development and escalation in pollution of our natural environment.
We Canadians are often accused of following the lead of the United States. That great
nation has gone a long way in fouling its own
water, air and land, and in contributing to the
joint pollution of the Great Lakes system. We
have followed their lead in this regard, but
not yet to the irretrievable degree that they
already have reached in some areas. Although
corrective and preventive measures will be
costly, we still have a choice that is within
our capability.
These are fields of activity in which Canada
can provide leadership, not only in the
Americas but in the world.
I believe that we are particularly well
equipped to give enlightened leadership in
developing the machinery, processes and
[Hon. Mr. Rattenbury.]

November 6, 1969

know-how in combatting pollution and promoting conservation. We have both the
human and the natural resources, in abundance, to direct into this exciting and challenging experiment. We have the technology
and the capability for its rapid expansion to
find new and economic solutions to these old
and largely unattended problems. And we
have the financial resources to undertake the
job on a massive scale.
It is a job that will require an increasing
level of public education and support. Public
awareness of the dangers of water pollution
was brought into homes across this nation
only last week in the excellent television
documentary "The Dying Waters," narrated
by Stanley Burke. It showed with shocking
clarity how promiscuous we have been in the
destruction of our inland rivers, lakes and
streams.
More programming of this calibre will soon
bring a high level of public awareness and
support for corrective measures. There will
also have to be an immense amount of co-operation between the municipal, provincial and
federal levels of government, if only because
of mixed jurisdictions. Above all else, industry must be made to co-operate, even though
it may mean both slightly lower levels of
profit and slightly higher product costs to the
consumer.
Our Canadian forest resource is one of the
greatest on earth. It has made our nation the
world leader in the pulp and paper industry.
Exports of forest products constitute one of
the largest plus factors in our delicate balance
of payments situation.
However, the pulp and paper industry is
also the greatest polluter of water on the
North American continent. That pronouncement was made only last month by the
Ontario Water Resources Commission. This
industry uses and pollutes vast quantities of
water daily-water that is often provided
through systems requiring large initial capital
outlays of public moneys, the supply of which
is continued at subsidized user rates.
The effluence of such mills is all too often
released in its raw state into our rivers. Its
content of wood fibre and chemicals is one of
the worst possible pollutants, robbing water
of its oxygen content and making it unlivable
for fish and other aquatic life.
On one river alone in New Brunswick, the
mighty Saint John, the pulp and paper industry has four major mills, and these provide a
good example of the magnitude of the problem and the various approaches to its
solution.

Novernber 6, 1969

Novemer 6.1969SENATE
DEBATES

One long-established miii is in the upper
reaches of the river at Edmundston. Its daily
discharge of waste into the river is equivalent
to the domestic wastes of a population of two
million. After many years of effort, the industry and government have developed a programn to overcome this pollution, the cost of
which will be several million dollars.
Midway down the main stem off the river,
at Nackawic, a new pulpmill is nearing the
production stage. At the insistence off government and with industry co-operation, pollution
controls off the most effective type known
today have been incorporated at the initial
construction stage at huge capital cost. This,
off course, is the ideal and least costly
approach to such control.
At the mouth and estuary off the river there
are two milîs. One, bult only a few years
ago, incorporated pollution controls at the
turne of construction, again at government
insistence and at great cost. This miii has
announced a prograrn to double its production
capacity, and it will doubtless improve its
control measures i the process.
The other mill at Saint John has minimal
pollution control and daily discharges approxi.mately 27 million gallons of waste directly
into the river. The cost off correcting this
volume of pollution, which reportedly constitutes about 60 per cent off the total of al
industrial, commercial and domestic sewage
and waste disposai in the greater Saint John
district, will be high. I have heard of no
published plans to correct or alleviate this
source off pollution.
There are, off course, other major sources of
pollution along this great watershed, many off
which are rapidly being abated or eliminated.
I refer in some detail to the forest industries simply because they have been the
greatest single cause off pollution in my province. It should be noted, too, that this industry
often despoils streams and rivers in getting
its wood supply to the milîs.
Many honourable senators are familiar
with the unique naines off the famous salmon
angiing rivers of New Brunswick: the
Miramichi, the Restigouche, the Kedgwick,
the Savogle, the Upsalquitch, the Tobique, the
Nepisiguit, the Nashwaak-all naines of
Indian origin-the Saint John and many
others.
2149"1S

Hon. Mr. Martin: The Premier of New
Brunswick must feel very proud as he listens
to the recital of the names of these great
rivers in the Province of New Brunswick.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: I do not know if he is as
proud when he hears about the problein off
pollution in New Brunswick.
Hon. Mr. Ratienbury: In some off those
rivers the Atlantic salmon was brought
almost to the point off extinction by the cutting and stream-driving practices off the forest
industries, together with their dumping off
millions off gallons off raw waste daily from
their mill operations. Trees were cut to the
shore line; bulldozers turned the river courses
into veritable sluiceways which dangerously
hastened normal run-off s; river bottoms were
covered, in many sections to a depth of several feet, with rotting, fetid bark.
This latter situation off rotting bark to a
depth of tens off feet, mixed with years off
chemical waste, has totally destroyed the
salmon run on the once famous St. Croix
River at the border between New Brunswick
and the State off Maine. During the heat off
the summer the stench is sickening, and the
chemicals entering the air from this effluence
are sufficiently strong to discolour permanently newly painted homes in the area. This has
actually happened. In recent years, more
strict regulations and their enforcement by
the provincial governinent have overcomne
many of the bad practices to which I have
refferred. But the dlean-up costs are high.
The technological advance off chipping
wood for transporting by rail, road and sea
has displaced stream-driving to such an
extent; that I believe only one large operator
in the province wrnl still have a log drive next
year.
These are instances wherein co-operation
between industry and goverrument, with
strong public support, are bringing good
resuits. But so much more needs to be done,
particularly in the treatment off millwaste, to
remove the mixture of wood fibre and chemicals from the water beffore it is discharged
back into the river.
I contend it is not; necessary to detail the
need for action in overcoming the stench
from pulpmills which causes air pollution.
When the wind is right, here on Parliament
Hill we can ail feel sympathy for those

SENATE DEBATES
households and families established in the
near vicinity of such a mill. It is no longer
acceptable in today's society that industry
should shrug this off as the smell of money
and jobs.
Honourable senators, I hope no one will
gain the impression that I am against the pulp
and paper industry. Quite the contrary. The
forest industry is one of the principal elements of the New Brunswick economy. We
have nine pulp and paper mills, with a tenth
about to be constructed. We are more than
pleased with the good jobs and economic stability provided by the industry; but we also
believe that these can be enjoyed together
with pure water and air and the intelligent
practice of silviculture to renew the forests
following the cutting that has taken place al
through our history as a province.
Before leaving the subject of pollution as
associated with the pulp and paper industry, I
would like to draw attention to the problem
brought about by the infestation of our
balsam forests in New Brunswick by the
spruce bud worm which first assumed major
proportions about 1950. However, it was not
until 1952 that corrective measures, on what
might be termed a co-operative basis, were
commenced.
Our forests in New Brunswick cover some
80 per cent of the total land area, and are 50
per cent Crown-owned and 50 per cent freehold. Consequently the provincial and federal
governments entered into an agreement with
the major companies engaged in the forest
industries whereby each would pay one-third
of the costs of an aerial spraying program to
save the forests and prevent the economic
chaos which would have resulted had the
infestation continued unchecked. It is ironic
that the pesticide DDT was used for the first
several years of this program, and that the
great dangers involved in its use were not
then known, as they are today. In fact, biologists are now discovering that wildlife such as
polar bears, seals and penguins have become
contaminated as the result of the continued
use of DDT, thousands of miles away from its
application. In common with all who have
become alarmed by this critical situation, I
am most relieved to learn that the federal
Government is taking positive steps toward
banning its use.
And the side effects are still being calculated. DDT has killed millions of small trout and
salmon, as well as birds. Honourable senators
[Hon. Mr. Rattenbury.]

November 6, 1969

should appreciate that our province is filled
with water courses. The DDT has been
washed down to the sea, and has been found
in measureable amounts in lobster and other
sea life.
I mention this simply to underline the absolute necessity for proving in advance all of
the qualities of chemicals, both good and bad,
prior to their approval for indiscriminate use
or general distribution.
In this one case alone of the wide use of
DDT throughout Canada, it will be years
before scientists can fully assess the damage
that may already have been done. We should
all take warning from the fact that for the
period ended September 30, 1968, sales of pest
control products in Canada had risen to $65
million, up ten per cent from the $59 million
of 1967. At the same time, we should all take
encouragement from the growing awareness
by the general public, industry and government at all levels, of the urgent need for
intelligent and well-planned programs to
overcome all serious sources of pollution of
our natural environment.
Honourable senators, the second subject
that I would like to discuss briefly is regional
economic development. Sincere but unco-ordinated efforts to correct regional disparities
have been made by previous administrations.
For the most part, those programs have enabled the Atlantic Provinces only to prevent
the gap between regional personal incomes
and economic activity, relative to the national
level, from growing wider.
Formation of the new Department of
Regional Economic Expansion, thus creating
an umbrella under which all existing federal
legislation in this field is being co-ordinated,
and the provision of new legislative tools at
the last session, have been necessary and constructive steps in the attack upon regional
disparity. Add to that the dedication of the
minister, the Honourable Jean Marchand, and
the prospects for success become even more
encouraging.
We are all aware of the now extensive
nature of direct incentives to industry that
will locate in the designated growth areas, so
there is no need to detail them at this time.
I would refer, however, to the broader
provisions of the act that give very considerable scope to the minister and the department
in providing the essential elements of infrastructure, such as may be beyond the financial

November 6, 1969

SENATE DEBATES

capability of provincial and municipal governments. These include the schools, hospitals, water and sewage systems, up-to-date
transportation and other necessities, without
which it is almost impossible to entice
modern management and industry to locate in
a given area.
In my own province the cities of Saint John
and Moncton are obvious growth centres,
where the indicated level of federal assistance
to the province and municipalities, in providing the essential elements of infrastructure,
will bring a much higher level of industrial
and economic activity.
One of the greatest and most basic needs in
this sector is modern, rapid, and efficient
transportation-by road, by rail, by water,
and by air. Innovation-new concepts in the
handling of freight and cargo-are now the
order of the day. Express highways, such as
the proposed Corridor Road from New Brunswick through Maine to Quebec, unit trains as
land bridges, jumbo cargo jets, containerization, cellular ships and modern port cargo
facilities-all of these and more must be part
of the new transportation picture on our eastern seaboard.
The governments of the four Atlantic Provinces have already conducted studies and
have made a joint submission to the federal
Government, expressing the urgent need for
major trunk highway development. Decisions
are anxiously awaited.
Only last month it was announced that a
containerization terminal will be constructed
at Saint John, keeping this vital and historic
Canadian port in the competitive forefront
for deep-sea shipping. This development has
resulted from months of hard work and
negotiation between federal and provincial
governments and their agencies, such as the
National Harbours Board, and, of course, the
private sector.
A consortium of three international shipping lines have reached agreement to use this
new terminal, which will be operated by the
C.P.R. and McLean-Kennedy Limited. Four
container vessels are now under construction
in West Germany, at a cost of $80 million, for
use by this consortium.
This new vigour of the Saint John area is
also clearly evident in the construction of
nearby Irving Canaport, a multi-million dollar
deep water oil terminal, capable of handling
the largest of the huge oil supertankers. I am
told that this port when completed will be the

only one of its kind on the whole North
American continent. The Irving oil refinery is
about to be doubled in capacity. These two
major developments will put Saint John on
the map as one of our nation's major oil
refining areas.
In addition, the provincial government has
undertaken active studies and planning
directed toward construction of a huge, deep
water superport, capable of handling the largest vessels afloat or on the drawing boards
for the foreseeable future. The proposed location is Lorneville, a short distance from the
City of Saint John, which appears to be
admirably suited for such development.
Honourable senators, these and other developments are most encouraging. They have
come only through excellent co-operation by
all levels of government and the private
sector as well as by organized labour. But aUl
of this must be fitted into a totally co-ordinated transportation policy which will bring
equally rapid development of highway, rail,
and airport facilities. We look to both the
Department of Transport and the Department
of Regional Economic Expansion for continued and accelerated co-operation in bringing this to reality.
Coupled with the quite remarkable industrial expansion already under way in New
Brunswick, we look forward to the realization
of a long held dream-to become, as a province, a net contributor of scale to the expanding economy of this great nation.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Yuzyk, debate

ADJOURNMENT
Hon. Paul Martin: Honourable senators, we

it seems desirable that we should now

Canada to take part in Armistice Day proceedings, as are some from other parts of
Canada. That being the case, I move, with
leave of the Senate, that when the Senate

DEBATES

Paul Martin, the Government Leader; Senator Jacques Flynn, the Leader of the Opposition; Senator Grattan O'Leary and Senator
Arthur Roebuck-made appropriate remarks
on the occasion of the 24th anniversary of the
United Nations Organization.
In view of the fact that on November 7 the
Soviet Union and comnmunists in various parts
of the world celebrated the 52nd anniversary
of the Russian Communist October Revolution, and the fact that the Canadian Government is interested ini making the United
Nations a more effective instrument in carrying out the principles of the charter, I have
chosen to deal with the policy of the Soviet
Union in this world organization. Because of
my academic background in the history of
Central and Eastern Europe, I think that I
shall be able to throw some light on this
topic, which should help to give us a better
understanding of what kind of relations
Canada should have with this super-power,
particularly in the United Nations. My speech
will be a kind of sequel to Senator McDonald's excellent report on NATO on
November 6. 1 sincerely congratulate him. for
his open-mindedness, frankness and logic.
Every country has its own view of the
proper function of the United Nations and
every country attempts to use the UN for its
own purposes. In general, the prosperous
countries of the West regard the organization
in political termns; their view is that its funetion is to maintain peace, punish the aggressor and prepare the ground for world government; they pay little attention to the
extensive welfare and technical programs.
The United States tries to use the United
Nations to contain communism and counteract left-wing revolutions. The Europeans
see in it a useful forum to discuss grievances
and a convenient centre for diplomatie contacts and negotiations wîth many nations. The
Soviet Russians look upon it, at least on the
surface, as a necessary evil in which they
must paralyze the plots of the "Imperialists".
The newly developing countries which were
former colonial states fervently support this
world organization, using it as an instrument
to voice their anxieties, so as to secure more
economic, technical and educational assistance
from the wealthy states. Ahi are worried
about preventing a third world war which,
with the modern super weaponis, could
destroy mankind.
Broadly speaking, the mem.ber states of the
UN are divided into two camps, the capitalist
and the communist, but there are also regional groupings.
21498-10

The "Fifty Years of Communism" that was
celebrated in the Soviet Union in 1967 was
certainhy not the communism envisaged by
Kari Marx and Friedrich Engels, the founders
of the theory. According to the concept of
these ideologists, comimunism meant a state of
affairs in which nation states wouhd "wither
away", the capitalist system would be
destroyed and the confliet of classes wouhd
vanish. In this sochet>' people would rid
themselves of the "opium of religion" and
would become educated so as to develop their
full potential and organize their life on the
basîs of "from each according to his ability, to
each according to his needs." This, of course,
bas not been achieved.
The "Fifty Years of Communism" is in
realhty the fifty years of the rifle of the Communist Party in the U.S.S.R. and other parts
of the world. The Communist Party was the
creation of Lenin, whose ideas very often differed from those of Marx and Engels. Lenin
established Bohshevism, wbich by means of a
well-discipllned organization of prof essional
revolutionaries destroyed Tsarist autocracy
and the "Bourgeois" provisional government
and set up what was called the "dictatorship
of the proletariat"l-the present Soviet
system. This "dictatorship of the prohetariat"
was to be a transitional stage in the evohution
to communism.
Many communhst leaders outside Russia,
ahthough in sympathy wîth the Russian October Revohution, did not endorse Lenin's
hihly centralized dictatorship of revohutionaries and the suppression of freedom. Rosa
Luxemburg, a revolutionary in Pohand and
one of the founders of the German Communist Party', is proving prophetic in her criticism of Lenin's Bohshevism in the following
manner:
Freedom restricted to the supporters of
a govermument, freedom only for the
members of one party, however numerous, is no sort of freedom. Freedom is
ahways and only the freedom of those
who think diflerentiy... Whtout the right
of free speech, the life of public institutions whhh wither away, become a shadow
and a masquerade and only bureaucracy
will remain as the active component.

put before them-in fact an oligarchy ... Under such conditions public life
will take on a new savagery and will lead
to political assassinations, the shooting of
hostages, and so on.

With her passionate belief in democracy,
freedom and the dignity of human life in the
new society, Rosa Luxemburg did not live
long enough to influence the communist
movement, for she was murdered less than
three weeks after the German Communist
Party had been established in December,
1918. Her assessment of Bolshevik methods of
fifty years ago describes quite accurately the
situation in the Soviet Union today.
Although Lenin adhered to dictatorial control of his Bolshevik Party, he did not hesitate to issue promises of "land, bread and
peace" as well as freedom, which, as subsequent events proved, were not intended to be
kept, but were merely a means of obtaining
power. Take, for example, one of the first
decrees of the Soviet of People's Commissars
dated November 15, 1917, concerning the subjugated peoples of the Tsarist Russian
empire:
1. All peoples of Russia are equal and
sovereign;
2. The peoples of Russia have the right
of self-determination including the right
of secession from Russia and of the
establishment of independent national
states of their own;
3. All national and religious-national
privileges and restrictions shall be
abolished;
4. The national minorities and ethnic
groups in Russian territory shall be given
every opportunity to develop freely.
When the Bolsheviks were in power under
the leadership of Lenin, the various subjugated peoples asserted their "right of self-determination, including the right of secession
from Russia and the establishment of
independent national states of their own."
One after the other, the non-Russian peoples
proclaimed their independent states, sixteen
in number, in the following order: Idel Ural

November 18, 1969

Republic (Siberia)-April 4, 1920; Turkestan-April 15, 1922. This was a democratic
anti-imperio-colonial manifestation. Gradually, the Russian Communist regime subverted
and conquered by force all those independent
states, and these nations are again part of the
Russian empire under totalitarian rule, not
much different from the autocratic Tsarist
regune.
Not only did the Russian communist government make a general declaration of selfdetermination, but we also have its formal
acknowledgment of this right with respect to
Ukraine, dated December 17, 1917:
We, the Soviet of People's Commissars,
recognize the Ukrainian National Republie and its right to separate from Russia
or to make an agreement with the Russian Repubic for federative or other similar mutual relations between them.
Everything that touches national rights
and the national independence of the
Ukrainian people, we, the Soviet of People's Commissars, accept clearly without
limitations and unreservedly.
This declaration proved to be deceitful and
perfidious, for at the time of its announcement the Russian Communist Government
immediately had a Ukrainian Soviet Republic
established in Kharkov, another city in
Ukraine, in direct opposition to the democratic Ukrainian National Republic. This Ukrainian Soviet Republic claimed to possess the
sovereignty of an independent state, but when
it became a member of the Union of Soviet
Socialist Republics in 1922, it lost its sovereignty, including the rights of amending its
own constitution, maintaining its own armed
forces, conducting its own foreign policy,
directing its own financial affairs, et cetera.
Ukraine, as a consequence, became a mere
province under the rigid control of the centralized Russian Communist Government in
Moscow, similar in many ways to her position
under the former Russian Tsarist regime.

To gain Ukrainian support for the final
phase of World War Il effort, to save his own

were given these rights and became founding
members of the United Nations. None of the
other members of the United Nations have

November 18, 1969

SENATE DEBATES

given recognition to Ukraine and Byelorussia,
knowing that these two countries have no
sovereignty. The Soviet Government does not
encourage such a step, undoubtedly fearful of
the fact that official diplomatic relations
between these two component "republics" and
the sovereign states of the world could stimulate the movement towards independence.
This was obvious at Expo '67 in Montreal.
Moscow refused a separate pavilion and exhibition for both Ukraine and Byelorussia, as
this would have made necessary a state visit
of these countries to Canada, implying the
recognition of the sovereignty of the Ukraine
and Byelorussia.
Communism, Lenin's brand, does not tolerate freedom and democracy. This becomes
abundantly evident just from a mere reading
of The Theses and Statutes of The Communist International, approved at the Second
Congress of the Communist International
(Comintern), which was held in Moscow in
1920 and has always been binding upon all
communist parties throughout the world. The
object of the Comintern is stated in the following sentence:
In order to overthrow the international
bourgeoisie and to create an international
Soviet Republic as a transition stage to
the complete abolition of the state, the
Communist International will use all
means at its disposal, including force of
arms.

it is only possible to speak of utilizing the
bourgeois State organizations with the
object of destroying them. . .The Commu-

nist Party enters such institutions not for
the purpose of organization work, but in
order to direct the masses to blow up the
whole bourgeois machinery and the parliament itself froam within.
Stating that the work of each communist
member in the bourgeois countries "consists
chiefly in making revolutionary propaganda
from the parliamentary platform," The
Theses of the Comintern specifies only one
loyalty. According to instructions:
The communist member is answerable
not to the wide mass of his constituents,
but to his own Communist Party-whether legal or illegal.

To achieve this purpose all means were to
serve the end, applying the Machiavellian
principle that the end justified the means.
This is how it was stated in The Theses:
It is especially necessary to carry on
illegal work in the army, navy and
police-on the other hand it is also
necessary in all cases without exception
not to limit oneself to illegal work, but to
carry on also legal work overcoming all
difficulties, founding a legal press and
legal organizations under the most
diverse circumstances, and, in case of
need, frequently changing names.

The Bolshevik leaders of the Soviet Union
have made plans to conquer the whole world,
some of which have already been implemented but sorne of which have also backfired.
Many leaders of communist parties in bourgeois countries have undergone training to
achieve this purpose. I have here a statement
of Dmitri Manuilsky, Minister of External
Affairs, who taught at the Lenin School of
Political Warfare in Moscow in 1931, where
several Canadian communists also took
courses. This is what he stated:
War to the hilt between communism
and capitalism is inevitable. Today, of
course, we are not strong enough to
attack. Our time will come in 20 to 30
years. To win we shall need the element
of surprise. The bourgeoisie will have to
be put to sleep; so we shall begin by
launching the most spectacular peace
movement on record. There will be electrifying overtures and unheard of concessions. The capitalist countries, stupid and
decadent, will rejoice to co-operate in
their own destruction. They will leap at
another chance to be friends. As soon as
their guard is down, we shall smash them
with our clenched fist.

Anyone who has followed the work of the
communist parties in the various countries
outside the U.S.S.R., including Canada, will
recognize that these instructions have been
adhered to, to the letter.
The communist view of parliaments in
capitalist countries was stated thus:
Communism repudiates parliamentarism as the form of the future. . . its aim
is to destroy parliamentarism. Therefore

It therefore comes as no surprise that after
World War II this "spectacular peace movement" came in the form of "peaceful co-existence" and every outward appearance was
made to display co-operation. That this was
merely a tactic to achieve ultimate victory is
evident from the speech of Prime Minister
Khrushchev to German communist leaders in
1955 in which he said:
People say our smiles are not honest.
That is not true. Our smile is real, not

which cannot allow "liberalization", democracy and freedom to make headway within its
jurisdiction.
We have already noted that the ultimate
goal of Soviet communism, as was spelled out
in the Comintern Theses of 1920, was world
conquest, which would employ all means at
its disposal, including deceit and force of
arms. Subsequently, dictator Joseph Stalin, in
his book, Marxism and the National Question,
outlined the methods of achieving this objective as follows:
1. Confuse, disorganize and destroy the
forces of capitalism around the world.
2. Bring all nations together into a
single world system of economy.
3. Force the advanced countries to pour
prolonged financial aid into the underdeveloped countries.
4. Divide the world into regional
groups as a transitional stage to total
world government. Populations will more
readily abandon their national loyalties
to a vague regional loyalty than they will
for a world authority. Later, the regionals
can be brought all the way into a single
world dictatorship of the proletariat.
The Comintern congresses of 1928 and 1936
formally adopted these intermediate goals of
communism in their programs. When the
U.S.S.R. entered the League of Nations in
1934 it began to carry out this broad program.
After achieving victory over Nazi Germany
in the Second World War, which would not
have been possible without the close collaboration and extensive aid of the Allies-the
United States, Great Britain and others-the
Soviet leaders expressed no gratitude to the
Allies, but immediately laid plans to continue
their efforts to dominate the world. On the
eve of the inception of the UN, the communist pamphlet entitled The United Nations,
published in 1945 in Bombay, India, advocated full support for this world organization,
giving the four primary reasons as:
1. The veto will protect the U.S.S.R.
from the rest of the world.
2. The UN will frustrate an effective
foreign policy of the major capitalist
countries.
3. The UN will be an extremely helpful
instrument in breaking up the colonial
territories of the non-communist countries.
4. The UN will eventually bring about
the amalgamation of all nations into a
single Soviet system.

This is precisely the blueprint that was initially drawn up by Lenin, elaborated by
Stalin and refined by Khrushchev for achieving world government and communist control
of the world by exploiting the United
Nations.
The use of such innocent-like tactics in the
overall strategy of attaining a concealed goal
is perhaps best illustrated by the story of the
young married man working in a baby-carriage factory in Germany at the beginning of
Hitler's regime. In his speech to the Senate of
the United States on February 23, 1954, Senator William Jenner related how this young
man had saved his money to buy one of the
baby-carriages which he was helping to build,
as his wife was expecting their first child.
When the factory refused to sell him the product, he began to collect the various parts
secretly. When he obtained all the parts, he
and his wife painstakingly put them together.
What a shock they received, when instead of
a baby-carriage, they beheld a machine gun!
It is obvious that the blueprint of the final
product had been planned years ahead. Many
unsuspecting people helped to produce the
product which could even be turned against
them.
This is the way the Kremlin master planners are exploiting the UN for their purposes.
The predesigned parts are being produced by
many unsuspecting workers who believe they
are helping to build baby carriages described
to them with such slogans as "peace","international co-operation", "world brotherhood",
"human rights", "peace-keeping operations",
et cetera. Little do many realize what the
final product could be when the component
parts are assembled.
Let us assemble some of the major parts of
the Soviet Russian blueprint for the United
Nations. Although the Third International
repudiated
parliamentarism,
Communist
members were instructed to enter bourgeois
parliaments "to direct the masses to blow up
the whole bourgeois machinery and the Parliament itself from within". Consequently, the
Soviets have been constantly using the rostrum of the United Nations to spread communism over all the world and to inflame colonial people and underdeveloped nations against
the western powers, particularly the United
States. Testifying to the Committee on unAmerican Activities, Dr. Marek Korowicz, a
UN delegate from communist Poland who
defected in 1953, stated:
We were all indoctrinated strongly
with the Russian master plan to reach

SENATE DEBATES
the working classes of the various countries in the western world over the heads
of their governments.. . The organization
of the UN is considered as one of the
most important platforms of Soviet
propaganda in the world... The UN offers
a parliamentary platform to the Soviet
politicians, and from this platform they
may preach to the populations of the
entire world and do their subversive
propaganda.
The Soviet Union has consistently used her
veto in the Security Council to paralyze the
work of the UN during international crises.
Of the 109 vetoes cast from January 1946 to
October 1967, almost all of them were cast by
the U.S.S.R., except France, four times; the
United Kingdom, three; and China, one. The
United States did not use its veto at all. The
Soviet Union vetoed all resolutions relating to
Soviet aggression in Hungary in 1956 and
recently her invasion of Czechoslovakia. She
has been attempting to make UN peace-keeping operations as ineffective as possible also
by refusing to contribute ber share. In such a
way the U.S.S.R. has used the UN to frustrate
the foreign policy of the major capitalist
countries; consequently, the veto should be
abolished, as advocated by Senator Roebuck,
or at least must be drastically modified.
The part of the Soviet Russian blueprint
that has been most successfully realized was
the role of the United Nations "in breaking
up the colonial territories of the non-communist countries", particularly in Africa. Commencing with 51 members 24 years ago, today
the UN has 126 members, during which time
some one billion people have achieved their
independence, thanks to the efforts of the UN.

November 18, 1969

great paradox of our age is the existence of a
United Nations member, the Soviet Union,
which has emerged as the world's greatest
imperialist power. It is most ironical that the
U.S.S.R. while steadily expanding has been
the loudest in the United Nations in denouneing imperialism. The greatest threat to the
freedom and independence of man and
nations and to the peace of the world today is
Soviet Russian imperialism, under the guise
of spreading revolutionary socialism and communism to all peoples.
We can be proud that Canada was one of
the first nations to challenge Russian colonialism in the United Nations. In his famous
speech of September 26, 1960, Prime Minister
John G. Diefenbaker reminded Khrushchev of
the Soviet declaration for "The complete and
final elimination of colonial regimes." Diefenbaker then presented the record of Britain
and France regarding the elimination of
colonialism, and I quote:
Since the last war, seventeen colonial
areas and territories, comprising more
than 40 million people, have been
brought to complete freedom by France.
In the saine period fourteen colonies and
territories, comprising half a billion
people, have achieved complete freedom
within the Commonwealth-this with the
approval, the encouragement and the
guidance of the United Nations, the Commonwealth and France. There are few
here that can speak with the authority of
Canada on the subject of colonialism, for
Canada was once a colony of both France
and the United Kingdom. We were the
first country which evolved over a hundred years ago by constitutional processes
from colonial status to independence
without severing the family connection.

SENATE DEBATES
when they have given assistance it was usually in the form of weapons and ammunition to
strengthen the communist and pro-communist
forces, as was the case in Katanga during the
Congo crisis. It is no surprise, for example,
that when the General Assembly in 1953
created a special UN fund for world economic
development, the United States found itself
paying nearly 70 per cent of the $5 billion.
In pursuit of the ultimate objective of
establishing world government, the Soviet
Union has concentrated on the Secretariat of
the United Nations, particularly on the permanent staff members. The communists know
that the resolutions and edicts passed by
voting delegates of the General Assembly and
the Security Council can be effectively neutralized and prevented from being realistically carried out by the thousands of international bureaucrats. J. Edgar Hoover, Director
of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBD,
disclosed in 1960 that between 70 to 80 per
cent of the iron curtain diplomatic representatives in the U.S. had "some type of espionage assignment", in spite of the loyalty oath
to the UN. Here is how Congressman Fred
Busbey explained the activities of iron curtain civil servants in the UN Secretariat to
Congress on August 3, 1953:
Agents of Russia, Czechoslovakia and
Poland, as employees of the World
Organization, face little or no surveillance of the type Americans face in communist countries. They can talk to
anyone. They can communicate with
Moscow by secret radio code; they can
travel back and forth between New York
and their home capitals freely, carrying
secret documents with immunity. They
are even free from arrest for minor
crimes. And, if one is caught red-handed
with secret U.S. documents, as was
Valentin Gubitchev in the Judith Coplon
case, he can count on merely being sent
home, his passage paid by the UN.
It is often not realized that one of the most
important positions in the United Nations is
that of the Under-Secretary General for Political and Security Council Affairs, about
which the public knows virtually nothing. Its
importance can be judged from the three
main areas of its responsibility:
1. Control of all military and police
functions of the United Nations peacekeeping forces.
2. Supervision of all disarmament
moves on the part of member nations.
[Hon. Mr. Yuzyk.]

November 18, 1969

3. Control of all atomic energy ultimately entrusted to the UN for peaceful
and "other" purposes.
It should be of concern to the free world
that, since the inception of the UN, this tremendous power has been in the hands preponderantly of high-ranking communistsone from Yugoslavia and seven from the
U.S.S.R.
Hon. Mr. Martin: May I ask the honourable
senator whether he has the name of the official in the Secretariat who comes from
Yugoslavia? Is that Mr. Proditch?
Hon. Mr. Yuzyk: I will look that up.
Hon. Mr. Martin: The honourable senator
can give it to me later. The man I have in
mind is Mr. Proditch-who is not a communist, of course.
Hon. Mr. Yuzyk: I would have to check on
the list that I have here.
The Soviet Union must not be allowed to
monopolize this important position, which
should be rotated on a more equitable basis
also among the democratic powers, with more
stringent supervision.
In order to prevent the Soviet Russian
blueprint objective of using the UN to "bring
about the amalgamation of all nations into a
single Soviet system"-which, of course, is
world government controlled by the Russian
communists-the free nations must watch
very closely all the activities of the UN
Secretariat and have it reformed to make it
more effective in carrying out the principles
of the United Nations. It has been a fortunate
turn of circumstances that Red China now
challenges the ascendancy of the Soviet Union
to world supremacy, which consequently has
undermined that threat for a while. Red
China is now a big thorn in the side of the
Russian imperial state. If the Canadian Government is resolved to approve Red China's
admission to the United Nations, it must as a
prerequisite and condition secure the strengthening of the executive arm of the UN.
At this time, when the free world is confronted with the brute force of Soviet imperialism, it is well to remember the imperishable
idea expressing the essence of the struggle of
humanity for its highest values which was
pronounced by that great President of the
United States, John Fitzgerald Kennedy, who
laid down his life at its altar:
The most powerful single force in the
world today is neither communism nor
capitalism, neither the H-bomb nor the

November 18, 1969

SENATE DEBATES

guided missile; it is man's eternal desire
to be free and independent.
In the struggle against this superpower, the
U.S.S.R., the hope of the free world lies in the
co-operation of the free nations and the effectiveness of the United Nations Organization.
We must never allow the free nations to fall
into a mental state of compromise with
Moscow which will undermine the highest
values of democracy, culture, religion and
humanitarianism. The defeat of Russian
imperialist communism is possible only by the
common mental and material effort of the
free nations and the captive, oppressed
nations. Consequently, much more must be
done to take advantage of the spiritual contribution and experience of these captive peoples who are the victims of the new form of
Russian imperialism.
After last year's celebration of the 20th
anniversary of the Universal Declaration of
Human Rights it must be constantly stressed
that the Soviet Union bas violated most of
these rights, which had originally been sanctioned by the U.S.S.R. The foundation of the
Charter of the United Nations is the recognition of the sovereign equality of all nations.
Member nations are obligated to refrain from
the threat and use of force against the territorial integrity and the sovereign independence of any state. In its work in the United
Nations the Canadian Government must insist
on the co-operation of the free nations to
make the Soviet Union adhere to the principles of the Charter and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. As strength is the
only language that communists understand,
the concerted action of the democratic and
free member states of the United Nations is
our only assurance at this time that freedom,
truth and justice will ultimately prevail for
all peoples.
Hon. Arthur W. Hoebuck: Honourable senators, may I congratulate Senator Yuzyk on
his excellent address. As he described the
idea of liberty in Moscow, I was reminded of
a description of freedom that I read very
recently. A gentleman of the southern United
States prior to the Civil War, in describing
liberty in general terms, said that his thought
of liberty was the right and freedom of every
man to do as he chose with his own "nigger".
I think the story, to some extent, applies to
the Soviet Union in its relationship with its
subject states, that is, the states over which it
exercises control.
I should like to make the observation that,
so far as Canada is concerned, our policy has

always been, and is now, one of self-determination for those states within its sphere of
influence and the sphere of influence of the
Soviet Union and all other spheres of influence. That has been the philosophy and policy
supported without exception by our former
Prime Minister Lester Pearson and by our
present leader in this house, who for so many
years represented Canada with ability, clarity
of thought and eloquence in the capitals of
the world. I refer to honourable Senator
Martin.
Self-determination is Canada's position
today. It is the position of our present Prime
Minister; it is the position of the Minister of
Foreign Affairs; I think it is the position
taken by all of us in Canada, and it defines
fairly well the attitude we adopt not only to
ourselves but also to the Soviet Union,
namely, the right of all states, no matter how
powerful or how weak they may be militarily,
to self-determination-to be masters of their
own destiny in their own local and foreign
aff airs.
Mr. Speaker, before proceeding to discuss
the Speech from the Throne, may I say that I
have noted the many compliments thrown
your way-and well deserved compliments
they are-for the way in which you have
presided over the affairs of this chamber for a
considerable length of time?
May I add my compliments to those who
have preceded me in this debate? They have
handled themselves competently and eloquently and have earned my unqualified
admiration and utmost goodwill. There is
very little for me to add at the moment in
this respect, except to adopt as my own all
the kind remarks that have been made by
everyone.
Honourable senators, I find the Speech from
the Throne a comprehensive document,
informing the people of Canada as well as the
members of this chamber of the Government's
thinking with respect to a number of outstanding problems of the day. May I be
allowed to enumerate some of those problems? There is the extension of the franchise;
the revitalization of the United Nations; freedom in the use of language; the difficult problems of pollution; the proper use of our natural resources. I am very pleased to note that
among these various problems referred to in
the Speech from the Throne is that of
inflation.
I am pleased that the Government regards
inflation as one of the most serious problems,
one "fraught with potential disaster". The

SENATE DEBATES
Goverrnent has declared its determination to
control inflation by every means within its
power. I congratulate the Prime Minister on
his leadership in this regard, and I wish him
success in restoring to the Canadian nation
the blessings of an honest dollar. By that I
mean a monetary unit which will purchase
today what it purchased yesterday and should
purchase tomorrow. I am particularly
so
with

expressed of using to that end every means
within the Government's possession. I wish
the present Government greater success in
that regard than has attended similar resolutions in the past.
The continued decrease in the purchasing
power of the Canadian dollar and the consequent increase in the cost of living is, in my
judgment, a national disaster of the first magnitude. It is with regard to the means available that I am concerned and would like to
speak to you this afternoon. The fall in the
value of money together with rising prices is
of such grave national importance that having
given this subject some study, I should like to
the best of my ability to share my thoughts
with my colleagues in this chamber and with
the public. Therefore if honourable senators
will bear with me for a while I shall discuss
this money question that seems so fraught
with mystery, is so difficult to understand, and
yet which is, I submit, rather simple.
Let me point out that there are two factors
which set the price in every transaction.
First, there is the intrinsic value of the commodity bought or sold, and, secondly, there is
the purchasing power of the money given in
payment.
That is elementary, but it is something
which because of the failure to bear it in
mind is frequently the cause of much confusion of thought. Furthermore, our means of
controlling rising prices have been employed
with respect to commodity values only and
we seem to have overlooked the falling value
of the money used in payment. If honourable
senators cast their minds back to the arguments and discussions of the past, both in the
Press and elsewhere, they will find that they
were usually concerned with the intrinsic
value of the commodity rather than the price
or value of the purchasing power of the
money used in payment. In his campaign to
control inflation, the Minister of Finance is
urging vendors generally to refrain from
increasing commodity prices and wages but,
as far as I have seen, nothing is said about
maintaining the value of our money.
[Hon. Mr. Roebuck.1

November 18, 1969

For many years the purchasing power of
the Canadian dollar has been continuously
declining so that wage rates generally, whether fixed by custom or by contract or otherwise, have been eroded in real value so that
employees were forced to battle to maintain
their standards of living, and disastrous
strikes have resulted.
The trade unions have recently been warned
against money demands, but union men have
seen the plight of working people whom we
have designated as the "working poor," that
is, the many thousands of unorganized workers in Canada whose wages are so inadequate
that their living standards are below the poverty line. Here I am speaking of working
men-men with jobs but who are so poorly
paid that they are below the poverty line.
I quote from Senator Croll's recent powerful speech on poverty where, speaking about
labour unions and the men belonging to
labour unions, he said-and I use his own
phrase-"they walked the picket line in order
to avoid the poverty line." I thought it was a
cryptic statement of the facts.
While I wish the Goverrnment success in its
efforts to hold down prices, I doubt its power
to persuade men to forgo wage gains while
they see others amassing millions.
But, honourable senators, Canadian wage
earners are not the only losers by inflation.
The invested savings of the people when
repayable in dollars have been stolen
away in huge amounts. People on fixed-dollar
incomes and retired pensioners and all those
who have investments or obligations which
are repayable in stated numbers of dollars
have been cruelly reduced to poverty. Downward fluctuations in Canadian money have
been a major disaster if not, indeed, a long
continuation of disasters for the masses of our
people.
But, honourable senators, this situation bas
not applied to everyone. It is perfectly obvious that what the creditor loses, the debtor
gains, and I pause to point out that ownership
of material things is not affected by falling
money. I might mention for instance real
estate or common shares, which give the right
to share in the profits of business; these are
not affected by the decline in money. The
value remains and the money value for their
purchase or for rent is adjusted accordingly,
and thus large financial institutions whose
obligations are repayable in dollars while
their assets are in equities, including real
estate, may be gainers of many millions of
dollars when the value of money which they
are under obligation to pay declines.

November 18, 1969

SENATE DEBATES

For instance, according to a pamphlet published recently by the Canadian Life Insurance Association, Canadian insurance companies at the end of 1969 will owe Canadian
policyholders $90 billion in life insurance.
Honourable senators, that is a huge sum. It is
payable, of course, in paper dollars at future
times and under stated conditions. Now,
Canadian money has declined in purchasing
power during the past eight years at the rate
of 4 or 5 per cent per annum. Consider for a
moment what that means. Five per cent of
$90 billion is $4,500 million. That is a gift of
that amount to the insurance companies at
the expense of 11 million Canadian policyholders. Of course it is only fair to point out
at this moment that some of the assets of the
Canadian companies are also in promises to
pay fixed amounts of paper money, such, for
instance, as Government bonds, so that they
will be losers to the extent they are paid in
the same type of security. However, we have
all seen these notable skyscrapers built by
insurance companies.
What the insurance companies lose and
others may gain is small comfort to the policyholders whose protection is whittled away by
continuous devaluation of Canadian money.
Trust and insurance companies, the banks,
and many others, whose obligations are
payable in dollars, are similarly affected.
What about the Government itself? According to the latest public accounts the
unmatured Government debt as of March 31,
1968 amounted to $20,579 million. During the
last fiscal year the purchasing value of the
Canadian dollar decreased by about 5 per
cent. Five per cent of $20 billion is $1,000
million, which the Government gains and
investors lose in a single year, in the value of
the money with which they are to be paid.
This monumental sum which the Government has gained in half a century-because
our money has been decreasing in value for
the last half a century, since Canada went off
the gold standard-is far beyond my power to
calculate, but I think an accountant who took
the time could very easily figure it out-it
would be a magnificient sum. The huge gains
of the debtors which the creditors have lost is
beyond my powers of calculation.
The falling purchasing power of money is,
in my judgment, the most monumental fraud
in the history of the people of Canada: it bas
brought misery to thousands of people living
on pensions or savings; it bas fouled wage
rates; it has brought about industrial turmoil;
it has invaded the kitchen and furrowed the
brow of the housewife.

All power, I say, to the Prime Minister who
will slay that dragon by every means within
the Government's capacity, but I wonder if
he and his associates have considered the
pressure a government encounters when millions of dollars are involved.
What concerns me at the present moment
and what I would like to discuss with you is
the means to be employed. Since the First
Great War, when we went off the gold standard, the value of our money bas been determined by supply and demand, and that only.
We took away from it the support of gold and
left it to supply and demand.
When the supply of currency goes up in
relation to demand, its value goes down; and,
vice versa, when supply is reduced in relation
to demand, its value goes up. That is illustrated almost daily in the operations of the international money exchange in New York, on
which the banks receive wired results every
day. It is very sensitive indeed. When there is
more Canadian money for sale in relation to
the foreign money which is being bought, the
price goes down; and, vice versa, when the
foreign money seeking sale is greater than the
Canadian money offering to be sold, you get
the opposite result. What I have said is supported in both logic and experience.
A notable example of what happens to
money when you increase the supply in circulation is that of the German mark. That is
almost traditional now. As the printing
presses operated, the mark fell in value and,
finally, the mark was utterly ruined by the
printing presses.
Honourable senators, take note of these
facts. According to the Dominion Bureau of
Statistics, the currency in circulation-that is,
notes and coins-in Canada in May 1956
totalled $1,807 million. In May 1967 it totalled
$3,029 million. That is an increase in 11 years
of $1,222 million in circulation in Canada; or,
shall I say, 60 per cent. I need not tell you
that during that period the cost of living
advanced concurrently and in very large
amounts.
Then in 1967-68 our financial chickens
came home to roost. Among other things, the
Government encountered difficulty in selling
its bonds. People naturally avoided investing
in securities repayable in depreciating money.
Speaking in London, Ontario, according to the
Globe and Mail of February 4, 1969, Mr.
Louis Rasminsky, the Governor of the Bank
of Canada, said this:
People are not foolish. When they saw

SENATE DEBATES
The next thing I would mention is government spending on the purchase of commodities that may increase the price of those commodities but not of other commodities. For
instance, if they bought up all the horses,
horses would sell on the open market at a
high price, but it would not affect the value
of all commodities, as does the fall in value of
the purchasing medium, the Canadian dollar.
I should add that the Government at the present time is making heroic efforts to reduce
its expenditures.
Another factor that is sometimes mentioned
as having some effect on the purchasing
power of money is the amount of deposits in
Canadian banks. Personally, I doubt it. If the
increase in the deposits had a direct effect
upon the value of our money, our money at
the present moment would be worthless
because the amounts on deposit have been
mounting by the hundreds of millions, and as
far as we know it bas not affected the value
of money.
Then there is moral suasion. As I have said,
the Government is urging merchants and
labour unions to refrain from price and wage
increases. Wages and profits, of course, form
part of the cost of production and thus may
affect prices. But, honourable senators, when
you consider the progress we have made in
technology and in the organization of production, the advances that have been made in
agriculture as well as in the factories, the
intrinsic value of commodities should have
decreased rather than increased. The prime
offender, in my judgment, has been falling
money, which bas increased the cost of living
as it bas in these past years.
I submit that if we really desire to stop
inflation, if we actually want an honest dollar-which I have described as one that buys
today what it bought yesterday and will buy
tomorrow-we will stop interested persons
flooding the circulation with unsupported
paper money, if it takes a ring in Rasminsky's
nose to accomplish it.

November 18, 1969

SENATE DEBATES

tically everything I shal say here this evening
will be redundant.
This bill contains 36 clauses spread over
some 56 pages, and there is a schedule to it
which is a model of the form of letters patent
under which hereafter, if the bill passes, trust
companies can be incorporated. I must say
also that at the time that the Senate Committee on Banking, Trade and Commerce considered the bill, they also considered the amendments to the Canadian and British Insurance
Companies Act, and the Foreign Insurance
Companies Act.
Many of the changes in the Trust Companies Act were parallel to the changes made in
those two acts, so that this one was a relatively simple measure to follow as a result of
that discussion. I propose to emphasize a few
of the highlights, and to remind my colleagues of the contents of the legislation.
The mother act itself, the original enactment, is chapter 272 of the Revised Statutes
of Canada 1952. It might be helpful and it
might simplify matters if we remind ourselves as to what a trust company is. We all
know in a general way that it holds and
invests trust funds, executes instruments of
trust of all kinds, and acts as executor,
administrator, curator; it also manages
estates, receives and manages sinking funds,
guarantees the repayment of moneys entrusted to it for investment through the medium
of guaranteed investment certificates; it acts
as transfer agent for securities and other
instruments issued by corporate enterprise,
acts as collection agency at times, acts as
depositor for chattels of value through its safe
deposit boxes, takes deposits of money which
it invests, and it holds and manages real
estate. This is a very general description of a
trust company, but in fact it is a recital of the
powers of a trust company which the Statutes
of Canada give it in Section 63.
A trust company also has certain investing
powers. It may invest unguaranteed trust
funds under certain conditions which are prescribed in the mother act. It invests guaranteed trust funds under more stringent conditions-and these are generally familiar
enough not to need an explanation from me
now. It lends both types of trust funds, under
prescribed conditions.
The measure was amended three times
since the Revised Statutes were passed-once
in 1958, by chapter 42, once in 1960-61, by
chapter 55, and again in 1964-65 by chapter
40. All of these amendments, which were
short in comparison to the bill now before

honourable senators, were-perhaps I should
not say liberalizing-were generalizing, extending the powers of the trust company to
meet the requirements of the modern market
place.
I examined the report of the Superintendent of Insurance for 1967. I understand that
the report for 1968 has been tabled, but it
was not available to me at the time. For
practical purposes, I think these figures I am
about to quote are sufficient.
Honourable senators may be interested to
know that there are nine federally incorporated trust companies administered by the
federal authority, and ten provincial trust
companies which are also administered by the
federal Superintendent of Insurance. In addition to these 19 trust companies which exist
in Canada, there are some 45 to 47 provincially incorporated trust companies. They operate
mainly within the confines of the province in
which they are incorporated. Altogether, they
do a considerable amount of business.
The provincial companies have $10.8 billion
worth of assets to administer and the federal
authorities have $3.5 billion worth. They
invest their own company funds, money that
they own themselves, their own capital and
the reserves that they accumulate from time
to time. They invest guaranteed funds, as I
have already mentioned, that is money which
is on deposit with them for a certain period
of time; and they guarantee repayment at
the end of that period of time with a certain
rate of interest which will not vary during
the guarantee period. Most of these types of
investment are covered by the Canadian
Deposit Insurance Corporation Act and so are
insured funds.
They also, of course, manage estates and
trusts. The funds that come to them under
trust documents of this kind are not guaranteed funds.
It is proper to say here that confidence in
the trust company business in Canada is very
high. This is owing, first, to the character of
the people in the industry and to the importance they attach to the trusteeship which is
conferred upon them. Secondly, it is due to
the further assurance the Canadian public has
as a result of the existence of the Canadian
Deposit Insurance Corporation.
There have been times when trust companies have been in difficulty, but it is important to say that the industry as a rule has
responded by stepping into the breach and
taking over, with the usual result that the
problem is corrected.

SENATE DEBATES
The purpose of this bill is to give better
service to the public than the good service
that has been given up to now. It is to modernize and up-date the requirements for trust
company business, and, on the administrative
side, to extend their powers to enlarge their
investment policies and their lending plans.
Perhaps one of the significant changes to be
noted is the fact that while, heretofore, trust
companies have had to be incorporated federally by special act of Parliament, now it will
be possible for them to be incorporated by
Letters Patent. Indeed, federally, parliamentary charters may be amended by Letters
Patent, but in every case, whether it is an
original incorporation or an amendment to an
existing charter, the superintendent's approval and his prior investigation are required.
Even provincially incorporated trust companies, under this bill, can incorporate and continue as federal trust companies; and, if they
do so, it is provided that the rights of all of
the creditors of the existing provincial company which becomes a federal company are
preserved.
In years gone by, the minimum capital
required by a trust company was $250,000. It
is now required that the minimum amount of
paid up capital before the company begins
business should be $1 million.
Licences are issued annually by the
superintendent, after examination. There is
now a new provision, not in the act passed
last spring, to the effect that old companies
which have gone out of existence and are no
longer licensed will, after a two-year period,
be considered to be no longer in being and
will not be able to carry on business.
The bill also provides that 75 per cent-in
other words, three-quarters-of the directors
must be Canadian citizens and Canadian residents. The minimum number of directors for
a federally incorporated trust company will
be five and the maximum thirty. Directors
must retire at the magic age of 75 years.
The restrictions on non-resident owned
shares are as follows: for an individual, 10
per cent, and for a group 25 per cent.
There are sections dealing with the requirements as to recording the shareholders'
names and addresses, and there are sections
which deal with the passing of by-laws and
amendments to by-laws which are, I think,
the kind of sections with which we are all
familiar and which we see regularly in acts of
this kind. As I have said, a foreign owner or
non-resident cannot own more than 25
[Hon. Mr. Connoly (Ottawa West).J

November 18, 1969

per cent, but even when he owns more than
50 per cent in an existing trust company his
rights are not to be infringed by this act.
There are provisions as to the holding of
annual general meetings, and as to the kind
of statements to be produced for the shareholders' inspection at annual meetings. There
is provision too for the appointment of auditors, and the requirements for the kind of
statement that auditors make is spelled out in
great detail.
Changes are also proposed in the investing
powers of trust companies. Heretofore they
have been restricted largely to mortgages on
freehold and the blue-chip type of investment
sometimes not particularly attractive, especially in the modern market. Under the bill,
trust companies will be able to invest in
mortgages on leaseholds and mortgages on
ground rents. They will be entitled to invest
outside Canada in countries where the company does business. An example of this would
be the Bahamas where our old friend Donald
Fleming is manager of a trust company and
the representative of a bank. It is, I think,
quite proper that a Canadian company of this
kind should invest and involve itself locally.
Hon. Mr. Martin: But this bill is not being
passed to accommodate Mr. Fleming.
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): But it
will help him, I hope. It will also permit
investment in real estate to earn income.
This, I think, is a new departure for trust
companies but a very sensible one. Any of
these investments in excess of 75 per cent of
the value of the property in which the investment is made must be guaranteed in one form
or another, and probably under the Canadian
Deposit Insurance Corporations Act. Other
types of guarantee could be given that would
satisfy the requirements of the superintendent in that respect.
It is interesting to note too that a trust
company can hereafter invest in properties
guaranteed by the Inter-American Development Bank, by the Asian Development Bank
or by the government of the country in which
it does business-and that will help Mr.
Fleming too.
Hon. Mr. Martin: I should know the
answer, but does the bill mention the Asian
Development Bank or the Inter-American
Development Bank?
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): Yes.

least 10 per cent of the issued stock. It is
proscribed from making loans to persons with
a "significant interest"-a significant interest
is said to be the ownership of 50 per cent of
the stock. I would say that that would be
quite significant!
Another type of loan that is prohibited is
what is generally called a downstream loan.
Unlike Senator Beaubien
and Senator
Gelinas, I am not familiar with these modern
technical terms and the jargon of St. James
Street and Bay Street, but I shall try to
explain this because I want to understand it
myself.
If, for example, Smith owns 50 per cent of
the shares of a trust company, and he also
owns 60 per cent of a mutual fund company,
and that mutual fund company owns 30 per
cent of a mortgage company, then under the
act, he is deemed to own 30 per cent of 60 per
cent, or 18 per cent, of the mortgage company. By subsection 4 of section 68 D of the act
as it will be, the trust company can neither
lend to nor invest in the mortgage company
or the mutual fund company as used in the
example.
That is an example of a downstream loan. I
suggest to honourable senators that they read
that subsection-

Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): He is an
old hand at political manoeuvering, let me

Loans can be made by trust companies, of
course, and the bill we passed last spring
allowed loans to be made under the provisions of the Canada Student Loans Act, the
Farm Improvement Loans Act, and the Fisheries Improvement Loans Act. This bill adds
the Small Businesses Loans Act. This applies
both to trust funds administered by a trust
company and to the company's own funds.

SENATE DEBATES
Honourable senators, I should like to speak
for just a moment about borrowing powers.
At one time a company could borrow more
than 10 times its capital and surplus. Subsequently that limit was raised to 15 times its
capital and surplus, and now it is being raised
to 20 times its capital and surplus.
There is provision for the filing of statements with the superintendent. Statements of
investments and loans have to be filed half
yearly. Statements of the company's assets
and liabilities must be filed quarterly. There
are special provisions for control by the superintendent. If he should find a company to be
in difficulty at a given time he is required
forthwith to report the difficulty to the minister. He and the minister have remedial
powers, however, to give the company an
opportunity to put its affairs in order, or an
agent of the superintendent can manage the
company for a period. A court order can also
be secured to operate or wind up the
company.
I hope that I have been neither too long nor
confusing in my explanation. In any event I
commend the bill to the chamber for
approval.
Hon. Jacques Flynn: Honourable senators,
as has been indicated by the sponsor, this
Bill S-8, an act to amend the Trust Companies Act, is practically, except in minor
details, the same measure that we passed last
spring. The full explanation given by Senator
Connolly has added to the clear and complete
explanations which were given by the Leader
of the Government last May when we passed
the previous bill. These explanations indicate
clearly that we have before us a highly technical piece of legislation, the purpose of
which is to update the Trust Companies Act.
I am quite sure I need not go into many of
the details of this bill. When we dealt with it
last spring, Senator Walker spoke on behalf
of the Opposition. In this connection I confirm
that Senator Connolly was speaking for every
member of this house when he expressed our
best wishes to Senator Walker for a speedy
recovery. Last spring Senator Walker suggested that this was truly a committee bill, one
which can be better discussed and examined
in committee. I fully agree with his suggestion, and therefore I do not propose to argue
or comment on any of its particulars, except
perhaps the provision that a provincially
incorporated trust company may be continued
in existence as a federally incorporated company if there is enabling legislation in the
[Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West).]

November 18, 1969

provinces. I do not know if any such legislation exists, but I know that there is a tendency at the present time in many provinces-I
know that it exists in Quebec also-for provincially incorporated trust companies to be
converted into federally incorporated companies. I think one of the reasons is that it gives
better security to clients and the public generally because we have the same type of
supervision
by the
Superintendent
of
Insurance.
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): And it
can move out of the province.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: The rules for disclosure
would be the same for all the companies
coming under the federal act. This, I think, is
the main reason why some provisions
explained by the sponsor of the bill have
been borrowed from the new Bank Act and
adjusted, because the trust companies are
called "near banks" and some provisions
applicable to banks should be applicable to
trust companies in that the latter do the same
kind of business as the banks.
In any event, a very full explanation of the
bill will be given again in committee. One has
already been given by the Superintendent of
Insurance, and he can tell us if any new facts
have been disclosed since we last examined
this bill in committee. At this time I do not
think we can do better than let the bill go to
committee and hear from the Superintendent
of Insurance or any other person or corporation who may have comments to make about
the proposed legislation.
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): I thank
Senator Flynn for his comments. What he
said is very appropriate, and is very much
what Senator Walker said when he spoke on
this measure last session.
I should like to add two further remarks. I
refer first to his comment about provincially
incorporated companies wanting to be converted into federally incorporated companies.
The supervision and security that might be
provided under the federal act may be one
thing, but perhaps the principal reason may
be that trust companies look for expanded
markets and better opportunities for wider
services. I think it is more profitable for them
to be able to start out in one province and
branch out into others.
My second comment is perhaps almost a
point of order. I think that consideration
should be given at some time to eliminating
the repetition of detail when bills of this
character have already been passed by this

Noveraber 18, 1969

house or the other place. We gave this bill
thorough consideration last spring, and then
the prorogation of the session bas intervened.
I do not say this or any government should
necessarily tie itself down, but we are all
anxious to try to save parliamentary time.
When we go through a bill again we ar'e not
doing that. The rule that a bill dies on the
order paper at the end of a session might be
reviewed with the object of saving parliamentary time. This is not a party matter; this is a
parliamentary matter. Parliament is an evolving thing, and I believe that this would be an
appropriate change to make.

SPEECH FROM THE THRONE
MOTION FOR ADDRESS IN REPLYDEBATE CONTINUED

The Senate resumed from earlier this day
consideration of His Excellency the Governor
General's speech at the opening of the session, and the motion of Hon. Mr. Desruisseaux, seconded by Hon. Mr. Everett, for an
address in reply thereto.
Hon. Donald Cameron: Honourable senators, in participating in the Speech from the
Throne, I would first extend my felicitations
to those who have spoken before me, particularly to the mover and the seconder, and the
others
who have participated in the
discussion.
Also, by way of introduction I would like to
comment on two speeches we have heard this
afternoon. Not being an historian, I wish
Senator Yuzyk had documented a little more
clearly the authorities he quoted. It is true
that he referred to a number of eminent persons, but I would like to refer back to the
documents in which their pronouncements
were written, because I think it is important
that we be able to evaluate the sources
of any statements made. It was, nevertheless,
a very interesting presentation. I sometimes
wonder, when he accuses the Russians-and I
am the last one to be defending them-of
breaching the United Nations Charter. It
would be an interesting exercise to see how

many other signers have also breached the
charter. I could think of a few.
I was particularly gratified with the presentation of Senator Roebuck. It was a thoughtful discussion in an area which is of tremendous concern to everybody today. When you
see trust companies offering interest of 8A or
çnine per cent and more, you know that the
individual who is borrowing that money is
paying 10 or 12 per cent. In bringing this
matter up, in regard to what bas happened to
the depreciation of our dollar, be touches on
one of the sore spots in our social system
today.
In the course of my remarks this evening I
will be touching on three matters which were
referred to in the Speech from the Throne.
somewhat obliquely, it is true.
First, the report of the Task Force on Information; and, secondly, the systematic appraisal of our Canadian society-after all, that is
what Senator Roebuck was talking about;
and thirdly, the importance of this tremendous
multi-disciplinary study of pollution.
Now, in the course of this debate, the
mover, Senator Everett, suggested that as
part of Canada's national policy we should
seek to disperse the establishment of Government agencies, departments and plants in
which the Government may have a direct
interest to different regions in Canada. Senator Everett made a plea for the wider dispersal of plants in Western Canada, and I would
like to second that appeal. It is generally
understood that the basis of all economic production today is an abundance of cheap
power, such as we have in Western Canada.
We have an abundance of hydro electric
power and we also have rich resources of
thermal power in gas, oil and coal in superabundance. I think that we have resources
and facilities which would enable us to compete very effectively, providing the dispersal
of industrial plants was given a little more
attention in our national policies.
One of the encouraging signs of the times
today is that western Canadians are showing
a new confidence in themselves and a new
competence in mobilizing their own resources
of manpower, skills and money. There are a
number of very encouraging developments in
the establishment of industrial plants and
financial institutions in the West, and this is
long overdue.
However, this is not the theme of my discussion today. I am really constrained to participate in this debate as a result of the

SENATE DEBATES
recommendations of the Task Force on Information. The Task Force has rightly emphasized the vitally important role that two-way
communication plays in the development of
any national enterprise, and whether or not
the establishment of an organization known as
"Information Canada" is the effective answer
to the present inadequate information system,
I am not prepared to say at this time. It
certainly could not be worse than the situation which exists now.
It is somewhat shocking to realize that the
Government has been spending anywhere
from $140 million to $148 million a year on
information. Surely in a time when we are
looking for ways of curtailing expenditures
and getting better value for those we do
make, this is one area where we could save
millions of dollars and still get better service.
The multiplicity of information officers, and
the reams of information sheets and other
publicity material that is pouring over the
desks of parliamentarians, newspapermen and
public officials every day, is nothing short of
scandalous. I have counted as many as seven
pieces of mail over my desk in one day from
the Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development. These information handouts have almost got to a point of such ridiculousness that they will soon be announcing
the opening of new outhouses in Aklavik. It
seems that every pettifogging move that is
made by the minister or some official of this
department must be publicized far and wide
and the Canadian taxpayer pays the shot.
I mention this department because I think
it is one of the worst offenders, but in fairness
I must say that the proliferation of this kind
of useless paper did not start with the present
minister. There are other departments of
Government that are addicted to the same
useless expenditure of time, energy and the
people's money. It is high time that we took a
new look at the information services, and it is
gratifying to know that something may be
done.
While on the subject of departmental use of
information systems, I think it is only fair to
state that in my judgment the most effective
type of information system in the Canadian
Government at the present time has been
developed in the Department of Agriculture.
While I am quite sure there could be
improvements in this department as well, it
is, nevertheless, true that they do have a
system and they have provided themselves
with the equipment which makes for an easy
provision of information as to what is being
[Hon. Mr. Cameron.]

November 18, 1969

done in the department, which is of benefit to
the people of this country. It is possible that
there is equipment in that department that
could serve many departments. This is something which I think should be looked into.
I want to register my agreement with the
task force when they state that communication, to be effective, must be a two-way operation. In other words, not only must there be
provision for getting information to the
people that is of value and importance to
them, but it is even more important that the
people be able to communicate with the Government and its agencies to give their reactions to governmental policies and to register
those reactions at the very core of the
administration.
In spite of the expenditures of over $100
million on publicity and information during
the past year, it is also true that there are
tremendous gaps in the people's knowledge of
what the Government is doing, what legislation exists that can be helpful to the people,
and the effect of governmental policies. So, I
am hopeful that out of the recommendations
of the task force will come machinery which
will be much more economical than the present wasteful use of public funds in disseminating what in many cases can only be
called useless trivia.
However, if we are to evolve proper understanding of the role of communication in our
society, we must also examine the role of the
mass media in relation to education, because
the purpose of an information system is to
inform-to give the people information; after
all, that is also the purpose of education-to
inform, to create understanding, in order that
people may be able to use the information in
good decision making. It is for this reason
that I am linking the role of education and
communication as two of the essential elements to which much more attention must be
paid if we are to solve some of the malaise in
our society.
During the past two years there has been a
growing unrest in all countries of the world
and much of it is centered in the universities.
For many years it was quite common for the
initiation of new ideas and new programs to
come from the universities in the older parts
of the world, and it was not uncommon that
the leadership in the initiation of new ideas
came from university students. Canada for
many years has been rather backward in this
respect; many of our students in the professional faculties found high demand for their
services, and consequently they centered their
energies on the acquisition of professional

November 18, 1969

SENATE DEBATES

degrees so that they could go out and earn
money. In recent years, however, there has
been a growing disillusionment in the universities. To begin with, the explosion of numbers has played a large role in what has been
happening.
University
enrolments
have
increased by percentages that far exceeded
any of the preliminary forecasts made five or
ten years ago. The result has been that
university administrators have accepted the
thesis that they should try to take care of all
of the students who applied to enter universities. Because of the acceptance of such large
numbers, university administrations have
endeavoured to provide the classrooms and
laboratory space to accommodate them, sometimes rather inadequately.
However, once the decision was made that
relatively few would be turned away and that
universities could provide classrooms and
laboratories to accommodate these huge
enrolments, the next important decision was
to provide the teachers in the classrooms to
cope with the numbers. In this respect, we
have been much less successful than in providing facilities.
The consequence has been that we have
many people teaching in our universities who
do not have either the personal or academic
qualifications necessary to give a good
account of themselves in the classroom. This
is one of the reasons for student unrest. The
challenge of too many poorly-trained, illadjusted professors in our classrooms is a
serious one and one which has contributed in
a substantial measure to the unrest among
the students.
During the past year I have had confrontations with students from one end of Canada
to the other, and I have little sympathy with
the rude, ill-disciplined, ill-informed students
who make up a large element among the
so-called "Campus Activists". On the other
hand, I know that among this same activist
group there are some very brilliant students,
and it is this brilliant minority who are
expressing themselves as being disillusioned
and dissatisfied with the kind of course-content and teaching that they are getting.
During the past year two groups have been
expressing themselves as dissatisfied with the
products of our universities. On the one hand,
we find the so-called hippies-and no one
needs to take this ill-disciplined, directionless
group too seriously. Much more serious, however, is the criticism that is coming from
many industrialists and businessmen, who are
saying that a good deal of teaching in universities, particularly in engineering and physics,

is irrelevant and unsuited to the kind of technological world in which we are living.
Here again, one of the answers lies in the
fact that some university faculties, in order to
meet the pressure of numbers, have looked
over the graduating classes and sought to
entice them directly into the teaching profession. Some of these have made good
teachers, many have been totally unsuited
and unsatisfactory. Again, as the years have
gone by and the explosion of numbers has
continued, the necessity for providing even
more instructors bas been accepted by the
universities and these original teachers, who
had little practical experience in the industrial world, have brought in others to teach who
likewise had little experience. Consequently,
we have in some faculties people who have
had little or no opportunity to participate in
the industrial life of our country, or to get to
know at first-hand something of the thinking,
something of the requirements, and something
of the projection of where we are going in
our developing technology.
The criticism has been particularly frequent in the fields of physics and engineering,
but the same criticism can be made with even
greater force in the fields of the humanities
and social sciences. There is an increasing
concern that the humanities and social
sciences have been left far behind in the race
with modern technology, and that one of the
reasons for the imbalance in our society is
that we have not devoted the resources, the
time or the energy, to train the people to
staff the schools of social sciences that are
needed to meet the dislocations in thinking
and the disclocations in social organization
which result from the explosion of technology
and the change from a rural to an urban
society.
There is concern in the universities about
the reduction in enrolment in physics and
engineering and the overflow of students into
the social sciences, where they have not sufficient trained staff to handle the increased
enrolment.
The students have been leaving the engineering subjects because they, with all their
youthful idealism, are disillusioned with what
they see of the uses to which modern technology is being put. They have been witnesses
to the war in Vietnam, the war in Biafra,
they have seen the chaos in South America
where a decadent, feudalistic society is trying
to prevent the social changes which are
bound to come.

SENATE DEBATES
It is no wonder that young people
today, as they look about the world, are disillusioned and cynical when they see the
results of what their elders have done with
the tremendous power that bas been given to
them through the gifts of modern science and
technology. But this swing to the social
sciences may pose an even greater threat than
anything they have seen before. What has
happened is that, as far as Canada is concerned, we have not been training enough
people in sociology, in psychology, in economics and in history, with the result that we
have brought in people in large numbers
from other countries, but particularly from
the United States. I want to make it clear at
this point that I am not reflecting on the
people from the United States, but many of
these people have come to Canada and are
teaching in fields where it is essential that
they have a knowledge of our history, our
traditions and our customs and ways. They
have come here without that knowledge and
yet it is vital that a person teaching in the
social sciences and the humanities have an
effective understanding of the milieu in which
he is working, otherwise he cannot do an
acceptable job.
As the pressure of student numbers has
increased in the humanities and social
sciences, the pressure on the university
administrations to get more staff has been
very heavy indeed and, as a result, they have
brought in more and more people from outside Canada and these people, in turn, when
they have required additional staff, have gone
back to the original source, with the result
that we have an imbalance in our teaching
staffs in Canada, particularly in the humanities and social sciences. Not enough Canadians and many foreigners are teaching
in an area of subject matter which should be
given a much higher priority in our universities than has been the case up to the present
time. Many of these import teachers are leftovers from the American universities, people
who ordinarily would not have been selected
to teach in first-class American schools.
Consequently, it is no accident that these are
the people who are causing some of the dissention and some of the disruption on our
campuses. They are not always doing it deliberately, but they are doing it in part because
they are working in a milieu in which they
have had no experience and they, in some
cases, are trying to impose an alien culture on
Canadians.
To support this, one has only to read the
reports that have appeared in the papers
[Hon. Mr. Cameron.]

November 18. 1969

recently; for one, I quote that pillar of
of
The University
academe,
Canadian
Toronto.
Hon. Mr. Martin: Thank you.
Hon. Mr. Cameron: Here I should like to
quote from an editorial in the Toronto Star of
November 14, 1969, under the title of,
"Arnericanization at the U of T":
The University of Toronto thinks of
itself as the lending Canadian university,
not only the biggest but also the best. It
probably is-but how Canadian is it?
A research report to the U of T commission on university government by
Daniel Drache has tried to answer this
question by checking the citizenship of
the teaching staff in the faculty of arts
and sciences.
If the findings do not warrant pushing
the panic button, neither should they be
complacently ignored. The U of T is not
yet so inundated with foreign professors
as some of the new universities, but it
exhibits the same trend.
Of 1,158 persons on the arts and
science teaching staffs of the university
and its colleges, only 54 per cent are
Canadian, 41 per cent are foreign and 5
per cent are not accounted for.
Canadians are in a minority in eight of
the 19 university departments, and in
another eight Canadians comprise less
than 60 per cent of the faculty. In five of
13 college departments Canadians are a
minority.
"The largest number of foreign nationals are American academics whose presence is pronounced and on the increase,"
says the report, and it suggests that they
have "greatly affected the policies of
departments, the teaching of disciplines
and the hiring of new university faculty."
The highest concentration of American
academics was found in eight university
departments, of which four (history,
anthropology, psychology and sociology)
are social sciences, and of which two
(philosophy and fine arts) are humanities.
We think the report is right in saying
that-with the exception of political
economy, where Canadians have an 86
per cent majorityand this applies only to the University of
Toronto-these disciplines perhaps more than any
others "are responsible for the formation

Novemnber 18, 1969

SENATE DEBATES

and imparting of social, intellectual,
national and class values."
The trend at the U of T, as elsewhere,
points to what the report calls "a new
intellectual and social imperialism,"
instead of the former domination of
Canadian universities by British traditions and models.
"What has changed Canadian universities is the introduction of a social and
scientific viewpoint which makes the
American
historical
viewpoint
the
Canadian historical viewpoint. The devastating effect of this structured colonialism has left its mark on Canadian studies, with the result that they become
mere imitations of American studies."
Without denying either the universality
of learning or Canada's need to import
many highly qualified foreign academics,
we maintain that, in sensitive subjects,
our universities should be oriented to
Canadian realities and concerns. And this
orientation can best be given by Canadian teachers. If the universities will not
voluntarily guarantee it, governments
will eventually have to insist that they do
so.

In similar vein I quote from a report in the
Ottawa Citizen of November 10, 1969, a story
entitled, "University of Windsor under Americanization":
A report prepared by three graduate
students at the University of Windsor
finds their own university wanting in
Canadian content and personnel.
The report, prepared by William
House, Robert McCrae and Robert Reynolds, says Canadian university students
"are now in exile in their own land."
Copies have been sent to Education Minister William Davis of Ontario and J. F.
Leddy, president of the University of
Windsor.
The report notes a steady decline in
the number of Canadians on the university faculty to 54 per cent from 76 per cent
in 1963, and the lack of Canadian content
in their lectures and text-books.
Even Canadian teachers received their
graduate education in the United States,
says the report, so that at present 57 per
cent of the PhDs on the University staff
were obtained from the U.S.

CANADA DISREGARDED

It notes that teaching in social science
and humanities pays little attention to
Canada, and Canadian literature is neglected, Canadian art ignored, and Canadian society disregarded.
Mr. House said in an interview Sunday
that from personal experiences the three
English department students had found
U.S. professors "look down on Canadian
culture and look down on Canadian
degrees."
Only one course in sociology addresses
itself to Canadian problems in a department where almost all courses "are U.S.
oriented
in
ideas,
problems
and
examples."
"If the trend continues," said Mr.
House, " We won't be able to find teaching jobs in Canadian universities. I, for
one, don't want to leave Canada."
The foregoing are important indicators of
what has been happening in our universities,
and they represent a trend which is of real
concern to every Canadian. It is quite obvious
that we have not been training enough of our
own people to fill the needs in the social
sciences and this can be very dangerous for
the welfare of Canada.
It is important to realize, I think, that the
deficiencies in our educational system are not
confined to Canada. There has been recently
published in the United States an excellent
report prepared by a special commission on
the social sciences of the National Science
Board. This excellent paper has just come out
and it indicates that in the United States,
where probably more attention has been paid
to the development of the social sciences than
in any other country, there is a great deal of
dissatisfaction with what is happening. The
report characterizes the social sciences as
academie disciplines and, mark this, it goes
on to say, and I quote:
Academic social scientists are primarily
interested in pursuing basic research
problems within their respective disciplines. They often pay relatively little
attention to practical applications of their
disciplines, though their interest in this
area is increasing. Many do consult on
applied problems for organizations outside universities. There are also a
number of recognized applied specialties-industrial relations, city planning,
economic forecasting, criminology, and
educational psychology, among others.

SENATE DEBATES
But even where these constitute formal
fields of study, they tend to be given
secondary status in the prestige structure
of the university.
The report continues:
Much (and varied) applied work is,
however, going on outside the colleges
and universities-in government, business, and independent research institutes-which is problem-centered and not
discipline-centered. This makes it difficult
to classify such research by discipline. A
social scientist often works on a problem
that bas traditionally 'belonged' to a discipline other than the one in which he
was trained. And one finds non-social
scientists (mathematicians, engineers, and
computer experts) increasingly working
on problems that social scientists have
traditionally regarded as their own.
And I say thank goodness for it.
The Commission went on to discuss the
obstacles to the use of the social sciences and
again I quote:
Well recognized obstacles to the utilization of social science knowledge lie
within the social sciences themselves and
social scientists must share the blame for
the failure to apply social science more
broadly. Most professional social scientists are employed in institutions where
their nonteaching activities are focussed
on their academic institutions and their
research. The research emphasis is on the
building up of the basic theoretical structure of the disciplines. And the social
scientist who works on applied problems
is often viewed as a second-class citizen-regarded by his academic peers as
inferior to colleagues who do basic
research.
It is high time we changed the emphasis.
Empirical research tends to be exploratory, or for the purpose of testing
theoretical propositions rather than for
practical problem solving. Even when
social science work is directed to application, it often produces fragments of
knowledge that need to be joined with
other fragments to present a program of
action. Until this is accomplished these
fragments lie around as John W. Gardner
has put it, "like loose bricks in a
brickyard".
Furthermore, when social scientists
have been called upon as consultants in

practical situations, many have failed to
deliver. Two general complaints have
been voiced about social scientists as consultants. First, communication has been
impeded because social scientists speak in
a jargon incomprehensible to the layman.
Social scientists are ordinarily able to
translate their own technical language
into terms more understandable to a
layman, and should make more of an
effort to do so. But the problems is partly
due to the layman. He is often unwilling
to make any effort to learn concepts-and
the technical language-of those he
consults.
Social scientists fail to meet demands
on them in a second way. When faced
with a specific problem that has no
ready-made conceptual answer, they frequently retreat to the laboratory for more
research and more facts. But the client
would ordinarily settle for less than a
scientifically adequate answer. He simply
wants the consultant to apply this trained
intelligence, and give help based on the
information on hand. When the consultant tells him he has formulated his problem in such a way that advice is impossible, too often the client retreats to his
office. And often any reformulation the
consultant suggests is ignored, to the
detriment of communication between
them.
The Commission identified five major
obstacles to the effective implementation of
social science recommendations and they list
these as:
1. Lack of clients. In other words, lack of
people who are prepared to employ trained
social scientists and use them in finding solutions to social and political problems. This is
important in terms of what is happening in
our universities today when students are
flocking to the social science fields and we
will not have jobs for them unless we act
quickly.
2. The distinct roles of social scientist and
policymakers. Here they go on at some length
to discuss the role of the social scientist in
preparing the necessary background information on which the policy-maker and the decision-maker must make a judgment. Too often
the recommendations of the social scientists
have been put in such a form that it has been
very easy for the more practical policy-makers to reject them as being impractical.
3. Implications that threaten the status quo.
And I can hear some of the objections that

November 18. 1969

SENATE DEBATES

will be made to Senator Roebuck's speech
this afternoon, because what he stated does
imply a challenge to the status quo.
Naturally, the social scientists are interested
in exploring those areas in their society
where there is an obvious maladjustment
from which the sources of discontent arise. In
the United States it is the unrest among the
negroes in the ghettos. In many countries of
the world today the subject of pollution
of the environment is a natural area in which
the social scientists must be concerned and
where he can perform a useful function, but
his function in gathering the facts and the
reactions of people can only be applied by
the practical businessman, the politician and
the community leader.
In all cases in this area the social scientist
is concerned with digging out the basic causes
of unrest and this involves a change in the
status quo. Whenever any group of people
pose a threat to the status quo, it immediately
becomes an emotional issue and people whose
personal interests are disturbed by a change
in the status quo will naturally always react
negatively. Thus the problem of communication becomes one of major importance in this
area because it is essential that people understand not only what is involved in the causal
factors of unrest, but what is involved if we
do not take the steps to correct the situation.
The fourth limitation on the utilization of
social science information is the financial one.
Obviously, if studies are to be carried out in
problem areas on a scale adequate to meet
the need, it is going to be very costly. Universities and institutions have not had the kind
of funds necessary to any more than scratch
the surface of some of these problems.
The report says in the section on this particular area:
In the marketplace of competing interests new public programs will obviously
meet least resistance when they are to be
financed from normal increases in government receipts, materializing without
changes in tax rates, and not endangering
current levels of support of other programs. Public programs that require
higher rates in existing taxes, and cut
into the resources of existing programs,
will be resisted. The extent of opposition
can be expected to be most strenuous,
when a specific group of taxpayers
believes its taxes will be earmarked for
the benefit of others.
21498-11

The fifth obstacle to the utilization of social
science information is the political process
itself. Here again the report goes on:
Finally, the implications of social science
findings must compete in the political
area
for implementation ...
Social
change-whether arising from social
science knowledge or from some other
source-threatens to erode the political
power of one or another individual or
group, not interested in sharing or giving
up the political position already held.
Whether or not the nation will use the
social sciences in a given instance
depends upon the outcome of the political
competition among different vested interests, with al their degrees of approval
and disapproval toward any matter at
issue.
And in a final paragraph, the report
continues:
The aim of the social sciences-in
common with all sciences-is to seek
knowledge and provide understanding,
not to determine the nation's values. This
is an important point. When social
science knowledge contributes to the
improvement of social programs that flow
from widely shared values, there is little
likelihood that political controversy will
occur. But when social science knowledge
suggests that values should change, or
that implicit values should be examined
and made explicit, political controversy
will almost surely arise.
This is an excellent summation of the situation we face today with respect to the major
problem areas in our country and in others.
In other words, wherever you go today there
is discontent--discontent in the universities;
discontent among the have-not groups; among
the negroes in the south; discontent in French
Canada, where there is feeling, rightly or
wrongly, that they have been deprived of economic opportunities; discontent over the
regional disparities in the distribution of
opportunities for equality of access to the
nature's resources; and discontent in the
developing countries where they see the gap
between the developed nations and the developing nations becoming wider and wider in
spite of the fact that the developed nations
have been pouring hundreds of millions of
dollars per year in the form of aid into the
developing countries.
All of these areas of discontent suggest that
there is a basic malaise in our social system
and the only way we can proceed to

SENATE DEBATES
solve it in a rational manner is to use more
resources in support of social sciences, in support of studies and surveys and analysis, in
order to arrive at the facts of the situation.
But the social scientists must not be permitted to work in isolation. They must work in
close co-operation with the people who will
be charged with the implementation of whatever recommendations come out of the studies. In other words, if we are to succeed in
bringing about the necessary social changes
that obviously will have to be made in our
society, it can only be done on the basis of a
wise combination of theory and practice, and
no matter how good the theory may be it is
not going to succeed unless it can carry along
with it the support of the practical men
who have to face the realities of the situation
and balance the pros and cons in the day-to,day operations. This brings us to the role of
the university administrations themselves. In
my judgment, too many universities have
been complacently concerned with preserving
the status quo in a day when the status quo is
no longer adequate. They have made the conscious decision to fill the classrooms with
inadequately trained teachers rather than
close the classroom down. It is a tough decision but one which I think will have to be
made. As a consequence, they have too many
teachers who cannot communicate with the
students, who cannot communicate with the
industrial and technological world which is
shaping the lives of their community. Thus
we have a revolt on the one hand against the
use of technology, as I indicated earlier, and
the feeling that some university administrators have been abandoning their responsibility for giving leadership in the institutions in
which they are concerned.
The theory has grown on many campuses
that we must have participatory democracy
on the campus and that the decisions which
must be made with respect to the administration must be collective decisions. So we are
witnessing the demand for faculties to have a
larger say in the administration of the
university. We are witnessing the demands of
students to have a larger say in the administration of the universities and selection of the
faculty.
Let us examine this for a moment and take
the students first. I think I was probably one
of the first students in a university in Canada
to be appointed to a university Senate in my
capacity as president of the student union. I
sat on the university Senate for a number of
years and it was an interesting experience. I
am sure that I did not contribute any great
[Hon. Mr. Cameron.]

November 18, 1969

wisdom to the collective decisions taken
there, but at least I learned something about
the background of university decision-making. I have always believed that students
should have a place on the university Senate,
on the Board of Governors and, possibly, on
the Faculty Council. I believe this, but not
because I think that the students have a great
deal to contribute to the deliberations of these
bodies. They cannot, because they have not
had the experience of life which would
enable them to contribute a great deal. However, it is extremely important that students
be on these boards as a means of effective
communication. In those cases where the students, as the consumers of the educational
product, can demonstrate that what they are
getting is an inferior quality of education and
that their time is being wasted, they do have
a right to speak. But the most important
result of having the students participate in
the decision-making bodies is that they may
learn something of the problems in the
administration of the multi-million dollar
educational institutions And if they are effective as representatives of the student body,
in turn they can communicate the various
facets of the problem to their fellows in the
student organizations. In other words, by
having student participation, you get a better
understanding between students and faculty
and students and administration.
Unfortunately, there are some university
administrators who have said, even today,
that they will not tolerate having students
appoin'ed to the Board of Governors or to the
university Senate or to the Faculty Councils.
On the other hand, there are some students
who have portrayed in an abject way their
incompetence to make any con'ribution to
this kind of decision-making body.
When students invade the Board of Governors' meetings, as they did at McGill last fall,
ard use insulting and obscene language, as
they did, they are certainly not contributing
to the welfare of the university or to their
own welfare. I am convinced that students, or
whoever it may be, who have to resort to
obscene and foul language and rudeness and
uncouth procedures do so because they have
nothing to say. They have nothing to communicate, so we can write them off without
too much consideration.
It is rather interesting to any observer of
the current scene to see this dissident hippy
or activist faction in the universities going
about their grubby, smelly way and who, by
the very nature of things, could not contribute to the running of anything. If we needed

21498-11J

SENATE DEBATES
particularly those in universities, who say
that even if we thought of having an audit, it
would be interference with their academic
freedom. This is complete tommyrot.
Today we are at a stage in our development
where science and technology have become so
important to the welfare of the nation that
we must establish a reasonably accurate
inventory of what the money is being used
for. We must establish an audit of what is
coming out of the expenditure of money, and
we must do this simply because we have not
enough money to do everything that people
would like to do. In other words, we have not
the resources of scientific and technical manpower sufficient to meet the needs. We have
not the resources of laboratory space and
scientific equipment, and so it becomes a
matter of plain common sense that we must
establish priorities.
Some academics and some scientists not in
universities will resent the establishment of
priorities if their particular pet project is not
included, but this is inevitable. We must
establish national goals of science policy for
this country. Other countries are concerned
with the same thing because science and technology have become too important to be carried forward on the laissez-faire basis, as has
been the case in the past. Science and technology have become too important for us to
permit a lack of communication to continue
any longer between government departments
and agencies, between government agencies
and industries, and between universities and
industry.
In defence of the laissez-faire attitude, there
are many scientists who are holding up their
hands in holy horror that anyone should have
the temerity to suggest there should be an
audit of what comes out of the expenditure of
funds. They go to great lengths to point out
that many of the great scientific discoveries
have come out of unplanned and empirical
scientific research. This is true, of course, and
in the establishment of any national science
policy we must be prudent in seeing that
there is an area in which the scientist will be
free and have the funds necessary to give
free rein to his imagination and to explore
the unknown.
Saying this in no way obviates the desirability and, in fact, the necessity of establishing priorities. If we consciously set aside a
portion of our national budget for free
experimental basic research we are providing
the freedom of action that is necessary. However, I do not think it is asking too much to
[Hon. Mr. Cameron.]

November 18, 1969

say to the scientists who would be working in
this field that we want to have some idea of
what they are trying to do, and what comes
out of it. The fact that the result of some
years' experimentation may be completely
negative is, in the scientific field, not necessarily a waste of money. The fact that what
seemed a promising avenue of productive
research turns out to be negative is not necessarily a waste of funds, because we will have
demonstrated that that particular alley was a
blind one.
In other words, it is to the scientist's own
advantage if there be a much more complete
degree of communication than has been the
case in the past.
We have recently had the report of the
Task Force on Information, and we hope that
out of this will come a more effective program of communication of the national goals
and aspirations of our people than we have
had in the past. We have, in the National
Film Board and the Canadian Broadcasting
Corporation, two instruments of public communication which can be used to illuminate
the national goals of this country in science
and technology and the humanities, and in
the problems of an evolving society in which
the resources of education are used more
effectively than we are using them at the
present time.
The National Film Board did a magnificent
job during the war, and the C.B.C. did likewise, but today there is a feeling that because
we may not have defined as clearly as we
might the goals of national policy for the
National Film Board and the Canadian
Broadcasting Corporation, there has been
some distortion of the objectives, and these
splendid instruments of public policy have
been somewhat less effective than they could
be.
How often do we hear today of the work of
the National Film Board in terms of its contribution to the illumination of the problems
of science and technology? Who hears of it in
terms of its use to educate people as to what
is involved in the problems of pollution,
whether it be water, sound and air, or the
problems of overcrowding in our cities? Who
has seen very much come out of the C.B.C. in
terms of national objectives? Both the
National Film Board and the C.B.C. have
made some valuable contributions to the
understanding of Canada and its problems,
but it seems to me that they could do a great
deal more if, as instruments of public policy,
they were used more directly and effectively
in dealing with problems of human concern.

November 18, 1969

I amn concerned about the remark of a
highly placed officer in the National Film
Board who said recently that he was sorry
the Board had flot developed enough expertise to make a film like the Swedish film I arn
Curious (Yellow). Honourable senators, can
you imagine this to be an objective of a
national public-supported entity such as the
National Film Board?
The same situation is true of members of
Pariament. In recent years the backbenchers
in Parliament have become frustrated and
disillusioned because they have feit that they
have flot been as effective a part of the Government as they should have been, and that
they have flot been able to make the contribution to society that they might have made.
Fortunately, as a resuit of the revision of the
rules of the other place during the last session, there is some hope that there will be a
more businesslike approach to the business of
the nation, that the Cabinet wiil function
more as a board of directors than has been
the case in the past, and that the line members of the parliamentary machine, the backbenchers, will be able to play a more effective
role and feel that they have an important
part in shaping policy and in the decisionmaking processes of governinent.
In recent years the institution of Parliament itself has come under increasing criticîsm, and the public at large has been concerned about what it considers a waste of
time and the dilatory progress in getting the
nation's business put through the parliamentary machine.
Two illustrations from the past session of
Parliament demonstrate what I mean. First of
ail, I refer to the filibuster by seven Creditîstes who for two weeks held Up the business
of the Governinent of Canada. Following that,
there was a protracted debate on Rules 75-A,
-B3, and -C, and particularly on Rule 75-C.
There was much repetition, and some Members of Parliarnent actually said that the
imposition of a time limit on debates in Parliament was an abridgement of the rights o!
Parliament. They said this in spite of the fact
that the Mother of Parliaments in the United
Kingdom has operated under a similar rule
for a long time, as has the Parliament o! the
Commonwealth of Ausfralia.
In other words, it has been accepted by
these parliaments that if the governmnent o!
the country is to function effectively there
mnust be some limit to the amount o! time
that can be given to repetitious, and often
uninformed, debate. After al. any government, regardless of its strength, is expected to

get the Queen's business done. If, under oui
democratic system, we find that the new rule
does flot work satisfactorily, then we have the
freedom to change it.
Time and again during these discussions
last winter I checked with people in whose
judgment I have reason to place confidencepeople in ail political parties-and I know
from the response I had that the reaction o!
these people was that this was just a waste of
time. In other words, these two illustrations
serve admirably to show that there was a
breakdown in communications between the
Government, the peoples' elected representatives, and the people who sent them to
Parliament.
To go into another sphere which is of concern to everyone today, let me discuss for a
moment the role o! the trade unions and the
right to strike.
We have had in the last three years two
strikes by the postal service, which struck at
the very heart of the people's convenience
and their right to service in this country. The
last time there was a strike for three weeks,
and there are rumnours today that there may
be another one.
During the past two years we have had
three strikes in the airlines which gravely
upset the business of this country, greatly
inconvenienced thousands of people, cost
hundreds of thousands of dollars in added
expense and inconvenience, and generally
snarled the business of the country.
In the first case this was caused by 4,300
airline mechanics who tied up the national
airline completely. They not only caused
inconvenience to as many as 18,000 Canadians
per day, but they caused thousands of their
fellow employees to go without pay cheques.
Then, as recently as the first week in October,
when 120 electronic technicians went on a
wildcat strike, they seriously discommoded
thousands of people. This kind of irresponsible utilization o! the strike weapon is flot
democracy; it is anarchy.
We have in the City of Ottawa at the present time negotiations going forward with
respect to the police department, and the
police are talking about going on strike. We
had the example of the utterly irresponsible
and absurd situation in Montreal on November 7 when the police force there went on
strike with disastrous resuits for ail to see.
Let me say at once that I arn one of those
who believe that the right to strike in any
form of the public service, where the welfare
of thousands and thousands of people is going

SENATE DEBATES
to be seriously and adversely affected, should
be removed. However, if the right to strike is
to be removed from people employed in the
public service, the postal service, the police,
hospitals, transportation, and other services, it
is imperative that the people of Canada make
doubly sure that these people can obtain justice. As a matter of fact, the employees of
many of these agencies to which I have
referred, who have gone on strike and caused
such disruption to the business of the country,
have not had justice. If we examine the
records of the postal workers, the police and
the longshoremen in Montreal, and many
others, we find that justice either bas not
been done or it bas been too long delayed.
In the case of the police in Montreal, as in
the case of the postal workers, they had been
putting forth their grievances to the public
officials in the responsible departments for
months and years without getting any action.
When it came to negotiating new contracts,
the negotiations dragged on and on for
months on end. So, I have a lot of sympathy
for the postal workers and others who have
been so frustrated that in their desperation
they decided there was no other way of
having their grievances dealt with than by
going on strike.
When we come to the airlines we have the
sarne situation as we do when we come to
the police in the City of Ottawa, where
negotiations have been going on since last
March. There is much to be said for the
dissatisfaction of these employees when it
takes months, and sometimes years, before
any attention is paid to their grievances.
In other words, the causal factor in many of
these strikes comes right back to the public
servants employed by the Government of
Canada, or by the municipalities. It is high
time that the dilatory tactics of these public
servants, which has resulted in the dragging
out of these negotiations for weeks and
months, should be brought to an end.
Some of these people are completely
divorced frorn reality. There has been a
breakdown in communication in an area
which affects us all. It is high time that we
took a new look at the rules by which our
economic activities are governed. In this
respect, while I am critical of the public servants who carried on the negotiations with
these particular segments of the public, I
must also say that a large measure of
responsibility falls on the shoulders of the
leaders of the trade unions of this country.
We have nearly two million people who are
members of trade unions in Canada. They
[Hon. Mr. Cameron.]

November 18, 1969

have performed a vitally useful function in
the industrial development of this country
and should receive full credit for it. At the
same time, there is no shadow of doubt that
some of these people have not been exercising
responsibility concomitant with the power
they occupy in the community.
In other words, power must carry with it
responsibility commensurate with that power.
There is a need today on the part of the trade
unions, both rank and file, but particularly on
the part of leadership, to inform themselves
and train themselves so that they have a
more realistic grasp of the importance of
their role in the total economy of the country.
Labour and management must work together for the benefit of the people as a whole. If
they do not, all we can have is chaos
and ultimately anarchy. No one would deny
the important role of the trade unions in our
economy. Certainly they have made an
important contribution to the welfare of the
country but there comes a time when, if the
word democracy is to mean anything, it must
mean that a small and irresponsible minority,
regardless of the provocation, cannot disrupt
the economy of the whole country.
Again I want to emphasize that if we
remove certain rights from people employed
in the public service, then we must be doubly
sure that efficient and effective machinery is
established which can make equitable decisions in a reasonable period of time.
There is no reason in the world why management and labour should wait until a contract runs out before starting negotiations on
a new one, yet this happens time and again.
Again it becomes a matter of effective communication. It becomes a matter of the effective exercise of the rights and responsibiliies
of democratic society. Unless we, the people,
communicate to those people in positions of
responsibility regardless of whether they be
in government, industry or labour, we are
falling down in our responsibility as citizens
and we must share the blame equally with
thern for any disruptions which may take
place.
Finally, and in conclusion, I suggest that if
we are te move forward in the development
of an enlightened Canadian society, we must
re-examine our national goals of public
policy, of communication and of education. I
come back to something I said earlier, that
two sections of our society are today saying
that our educational system is irrelevant in
terrns of the realities of today's world. One
section is the hippies and the discontented

November 18, 1969

Novebor18, 969SENATE
DEBATES

among the bright young people coming out of
our schools and colleges. The other is the
businessmen, industrialists and the research
directors in industry who are saying that
rnuch of our education is irrelevant to the
needs of industry.
Our educational authorities, whether it be
at high schooi level or at university level,
cannot ignore this groundswefl of criticism
that education for the status quo is no longer
good enough for the technological age in
which we are living. It is being seriously suggested that education as it is being practised
has not adapted to change with the speed
which is necessary and desirable. Too much
deadwood is being retained in the curricula of
our schools and colleges. Too many outworn
and outdated methods are being used, and
insufficient use is being made of the modemn
tools of communication.
Secondly, we must forget about shortcuts.
A lot of the cuits we have in education
today-the people who go off the deep end in
group dynamics, group thinks and so on-are
very often the people who have taken a good
idea and tried to build it into what they
consider to be a shortcut to Utopia.
The experience of history has long determined that to achieve perfection in the world,
or in a profession, or in the development of a
skill, teaching in a university, or admînistering an industrial complex, there are no shortcuts to success. The top leadership in the arts,
in business and in governmnent are always the
people who have devoted themselves with
dedication and long hours of work to the
perfection of their craft. The days ahead must
be days of total education and total dedication. Continuing education has become a full
partner with ail other forms of educationelementary, secondary and university and
post-university.
Today we must be as concerned with the
dropout who has a PhD. as with the dropout
who has a Grade VII education. They each
must have the opportunity and responsibility
of going back to school if they are to bo able
to keep the pace and to make their proper
contribution to society.
Finally I say that the goals of education for
today's generation must involve:
1. A re-examination of our ultimate goals.
What do we want from our educational
system? What do we want from society and
what do we need?
2. It must involve the stripping away of
some traditional curriculum content and its

replacement with material that is more relevant to the age of space and interdependence
of nations.
3. It must use the modern tools of communication at every level, elementary,
secondary and aduit.
4. It must be concerned with the establishment of ever-higher standards for those

Hon. Mr. Sullivan: Might I ask Senator
Cameron a question in view of the fact that
he has taken the name of the University of
Toronto ini vain? He being a professor in the
arts and humanities, I would like him to help
me as an academie and former professor ini
medicine to form an opinion as to why it is
that the dissident elements in university life
are among the social scientists and their
academic staff? You do flot Eind them in
medicine, engineering, law, dentlstry, nor
commerce and finance.
Han. Mr. Cameron: It is a very good question and one which a lot of people are asking.
My answer is that in the professional schoo]s
the students are kept very busy vorking
towards definite goals in which the> see what

SENATE DEBATES
they are going to do at the end of their
career. In the arts and the humanities, particularly what I call the undisciplined
disciplinesHon. Mr. Sullivan: Sociology.
Hon. Mr. Cameron: Sociology is the worst
offender. The people teaching in sociology
have so far not evolved a methodology which
is effective. They are not clear in their goals.
As I emphasize in this paper, they have shied
away from being associated with the people
who have to implement their recommendations. It is all theory and little practice.
Hon. Mr. Burchill: I was very much interested in what Senator Cameron had to say
about the teaching staffs of universities today
and of the foreign element on those staffs.
Are the professors available here in Canada?
Hon. Mr. Cameron: No, they are not. The
reason is that we have not given the necessary priority to training Canadians to fill this
gap, yet the students are flocking into this
area in unprecedented numbers.
We therefore have two problems. We have
not the quality of staff in Canada to teach
them; we are not getting enough good teachers from other countries to teach them,
because you cannot teach effectively in this
field unless you are familiar with the history,
background and traditions of our people. No
foreigner, regardless of how competent he
may be, can do this without a lot of experience. With the large number of students
coming into the humanities, we cannot see the
jobs for them in the immediate future unless
we are prepared to increase greatly the
amount of money we devote to research, surveys and studies, particularly on pollution,
which is a good example. With all our good
laboratories, we have the biggest challenge of
all times to face. There must be a multi-disciplinary approach, but we have not got the
trained people to do it.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Aseltine, debate

CANADIAN AND BRITISH INSURANCE
COMPANIES ACT
BILL TO AMEND-SECOND READING
Hon. Daniel A. Lang

moved the second

reading of Bill S-6, to amend the Canadian
and British Insurance Companies Act and
other statutory provisions related to the subject matter of certain of those amendments.
[Hon. Mr. Cameron.]

November 18, 1969

He said: Honourable senators, because of
the hour I will tonight make my remarks by
reference. This bill is the same as the one
that was in this house on May 8, when at
page 1412 of Hansard I made a speech on
second reading. I would ask all honourable
senators who are interested in refreshing
their memories to refer to that speech.
Since that bill passed this house there have
undoubtedly been representations made to
departmental officials, and departmental officials themselves have learned from their own
further studies of certain omissions, oversights and technical errors in the original
draft, namely, thirteen in number. These are
of no significance to the policy of the bill, and
honourable senators who may wish to inquire
into them will have available in committee
the expertise of the departmental officials
involved.
I will only say generally that this is a significant piece of legislation, broadening and
expanding the powers of insurance companies
in accordance with the demands now being
placed generally by the public upon trust
companies, insurance companies and loan
companies to provide a proper and more adequate service, in keeping with present-day
financial requirements, which these companies have in the past been unable to perform
because of the limitations and restrictions
placed upon them through the statutory
instruments under which they operate.
I would only say as a personal reference
that notwithstanding that, I understand the
insurance companies endorse all of these
amendments, to the extent that they accept
their powers and permit them to operate with
slight variations-and I say slight because of
the broad scope-fron the present activities.
As I understand it, they thoroughly endorse
these things and welcome the initiative of the
Government in bringing them forward. What
does strike me is that contained in this legislation are massive further controls, arbitrary
controls, placed upon these companies to be
exercised by the Superintendent of Insurance.
I think that by and large, in view of the
atmosphere in the financial community that
we have experienced during the last few
years, these are necessary and desirable.
What does rather astound me-and I think
to some extent it reflects on the vitality of
our financial community today-is that I have
heard of no objections to these additional restrictions coming from the institutions them-

selves. I say that without comiment. I do not
know why they have flot corne forward. Normally, in an atmosphere like this it would be
thought that these restrictions on the freedom
of their activities would receive a f ar heavier
scrutiny by the industry. They seem to be
accepting them, and in return they are
endorsing the restrictions on their freedom.
Overali, and bearing in mind the recent history of financial institutions in this country,
these developments, both restrictive and mandatory, are necessary and desirable now, and
I commend this bill to honourable senators
for their f avourable consideration.

SENATE DEBATES

THE ESTIMATES
SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES (A) REFERRED
TO FINANCE COMMITTEE

Hon. Leopold Langlois, with leave of the
Senate, moved:
That the Standing Senate Committee
on National Finance be authorized to
examine and report upon the expenditures set out in the Supplementary Estimates (A) laid before Parliament for the
fiscal year ending the 31st March, 1970.
Motion agreed to.
TAX REFORM
WHITE PAPER ON TAXATION REFERRED
TO COMMITTEE

Hon. Paul Martin, with leave of the Senate,
moved:
That the Standing Senate Committee
on Banking, Trade and Commerce be
authorized to examine and report upon
the White Paper entitled: "Proposals for
Tax Reform", prepared by the Minister
of Finance, and tabled in the Senate, on
Tuesday, 18th November, 1969.
Hon. Daniel A. Lang: May I direct a query
to the Leader of the Government? Is this to
be an inquiry in addition to or in lieu of what
I understood was to be an examination of the
white paper by a joint committee of both
houses?
Hon. Mr. Martin: In answer to a recent
question put by the Leader of the Opposition,
I explained that it was not intended to proceed by way of a joint committee as had been
proposed and voted on in the last session of
Parliament. It is now proposed that the white
paper be referred to a committee of this
house. There is a similar proposal in the other
place, that it be sent to a committee of that
house.
Hon. Walter M. Aseltine: Honourable senators, I think this is a mistake. I am very much
in favour of a consideration of the white
paper by a joint committee of the Senate and
the House of Commons, and I had intended to
speak to that point later this afternoon. This
motion has taken me by surprise. We have in
the Senate a number of senators who are
experts in tax matters and I would like to see
a joint committee set up with ten of those
senators as members of that committee. I
think a better study would be done by a joint
committee than by separate committees.
21498-121

There would be less danger of duplication
and less difficulty in the examination of witnesses. For that reason I am opposed to this
motion.
Hon. Mr. Martin: I am sure there are two
views on this question. That was the view
maintained at the end of the last session. It
will be recalled that the motion to establish a
joint committee was made in this house and
sent to the other place. However, with the
commencement of a new session it was decided that in the other place the matter would
be referred to a committee of that chamber.
As a result, this motion is now before us. It is
the only course that could be taken.
Hon. Arthur W. Roebuck: Honourable
senators, may I briefly express a view which I
regret is a little contrary to that of my friend
Senator Aseltine. We have had some experience with joint committees, and the old principle stands, that when you have a large committee you dilute the individuality of the report.
The Senate is a different type of house
from the Commons. We are different in our
personnel, in our origin, in our responsibilitics and in the view that the nation takes of
us. I would like to see our personality and our
individuality maintained. Our view of this
document may be vastly different from that
of those who form the membership of the
other house. I would much prefer that we take
our own view of this matter and bring in our
own report. It is much simpler to manage a
committee of our own house than it is a joint
committee. Our report is very much more
likely to be incisive than if we dilute our
thought with that of those who are not members of this chamber.
I would rather that we take our own
responsibility, express our own opinions and
bring in a report that is a Senate report, and
not a diluted finding of both houses.
Hon. Jacques Flynn: Honourable senators,
I am not taking sides. I think it is quite
obvious that the Government would have
preferred a joint committee. Even if in a
joint committee the voice of the Senate could
not have been heard as clearly as in a Senate
committee, I think it would probably have
avoided duplication. However, it is quite evident that the Government does not feel it can
proceed with a joint committee. This, I suspect, is due to some criticism made in the
other place at the end of the last session, of

SENATE DEBATES

some of us might like to have the ready reference from him so as to be able to follow it
up.

Hon. Andrew Thompson: Honourable senators, I appreciate, as I am sure all of us do,
the very lucid, objective and interesting discourse that we heard from the honourable
Senator Yuzyk. I know that as an historian of
note be has an objectivity with respect to the
remarks he made.
I should like to mention one point which
perhaps I did not understand correctly. Having read a number of the UN speeches by
government representatives of either party, I
think this question of the role that Canada
and its representatives have played in the UN
in speaking out against Russian imperialism
transcends party politics. I may be mistaken
in this, but I understood the honourable senator to say that the first speech against Russian imperialism in the United Nations was
made by one particular prime minister.
Having done some research in this, I know
that former Prime Minister Lester Pearson
bas been called a mad dog of American
imperialism by Andrei Vishinsky. The Honourable Paul Martin bas made a number of
speeches denouncing Russian imperialism and
bas also suffered the indignity of being
denounced by the representatives of the
Soviet Union.
I am sure that this was not an impression
that the honourable senator intended to
create, and I want to make it clear that perhaps I had a false impression from listening
to him.
SPEECH FROM THE THRONE
ADDRESS IN REPLY ADOPTED

The Senate resumed from yesterday consideration of His Excellency the Governor
General's speech at the opening of the session, and the motion of Hon. Mr. Desruisseaux, seconded by Hon. Mr. Everett, for an
address in reply thereto.
Hon. Walter M. Aseltine: Honourable senators, I concur in the introductory remarks of
previous speakers about the mover and
seconder of the Address in Reply to the
Speech of the Governor General,. our distinguished Speaker, the House Leaders and
others. On that account I will refrain from
adding further congratulations of my own.
Hon. Mr. Martin: Will the honourable senator permit me to congratulate him on having
recovered from his very severe illness last

summer, and being present in this bouse,
looking fit and ready to make a fighting
speech.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: I thank the Leader of
the Senate very kindly for those pleasing
remarks.
Hon. Mr. Martin: You cannot be too hard
on us now.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: Don't count too much on
that.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: After listening to three
major speeches on the motion for an address
in reply delivered yesterday, I feel honourable senators will consider my remarks this
afternoon to be of a more or less down-toearth variety, because I will speak as briefly
as I can on agriculture, which was referred to
shortly in the Speech from the Throne-just
one paragraph, which I will not now read.
I was very much impressed by the speech
of Senator Argue about the crisis in agriculture in Canada, particularly in the Prairie
Provinces. He said there was also more or
less a crisis in Eastern Canada, but he did not
deal with that question, and as I am not fully
acquainted with it, I will not deal with it
either. He emphasized time and time again in
his speech the seriousness of the situation in
Western Canada. After his speech, I was
asked by some honourable senators in the
lobby if some of the statements made by the
senator were not at least slightly exaggerated.
I replied that be certainly was not exaggerating anything, because in my opinion there is
a real crisis, which bas been building up for
some three years and the prospect of improvement in the near future is not very
bright.
Had I known in time that there was to be a
full-dress debate on this question in the other
place yesterday, I probably would not be
speaking on it now, but having spent some
time gathering together information I have
decided to go ahead. What I wish to do now is
develop and emphasize some other matters
which were referred to by Senator Argue and
possibly to add something to them.
In the first place, I wish to say that ever
since the 1966 crops were harvested, wheat
has been piling up, unsold, on the farms in
western Canada. Many thousands of bushels
are being held in storage on the farms right
now. Every available building that will hold
wheat is full. In addition, the farmers themselves have built many thousands of circular
plywood bins, and these are full of wheat.

174

SENATE DEBATES

Some of these bins are covered but most are
not. We also have thousands of piles of wheat
lying on the ground, exposed to ruin by the
weather. The reason for this, honourable
senators, is that even though we had some
wheat left over unsold from the 1966 crop, it
was not a very large amount. However, the
1967 crop was a very big one, and the Wheat
Board authorized a delivery quota of only six
bushels to the specified acre. You can imagine
how much wheat could be marketed on a
six-bushel quota when you consider that
the crop that year was in the neighbourhood
of six or seven hundred million bushels.
Again in 1968 we had a large crop of wheat,
but the authorized delivery quota was only
five bushels per specified acre; and in 1969 we
had one of the largest crops ever grown and
as yet there is no quota at all for that crop.
The elevators are full and, as I have just
said, as yet no delivery quotas have been set
up for the marketing of wheat this fall.
Farmers are selling good wheat at 30, 40 and
50 cents a bushel for feed. The other day I
was offered 50 cents a bushel for a 300-bushel
truckload of 1968 wheat, to be delivered away
out in the southern part of the province, some
200 miles away. It would take $50 to pay for
the truck, and I would receive $100 net for
the wheat.
Many people who are hard up for money
and in desperate financial circumstances are
disposing of wheat at these prices. Naturally,
the farmer's share is getting less and less and
all the time we are losing sales. Our sales are
lagging and we are letting the United States,
Australia and other countries outsell us on
the markets of the world. What are the
Government's intentions? What are the guidelines? Have any been set up? There are none
that I know of. How do they propose to tackle
the problems that exist? A Canadian Grain
Council bas been set up, but it has not done
anything yet and I have little faith in it.
Another matter referred to by Senator
Argue was the interest-free advances on
farm-stored grain. Taxes on good farms in
Saskatchewan are about $2 an acre. If a
farmer has obtained an interest-free cash
advance, when he takes a load of grain to the
elevator-when a quota is set up allowing
him to do so-they first take out one-half of
the proceeds and send it to the Wheat Board
to apply on the interest-free advance, and this
was not mentioned by Senator Argue. But
that is not all. If the taxes have not been
paid, the municipality sends a notice to the
elevator agent and he is obliged to take the
[Hon. Mr. Aseltine.]

November 19, 1969

other half of the proceeds of that load of
wheat and forward it to the municipality to
apply on the taxes. So the poor farmer gets
nothing out of his load of wheat. That
arrangement continues until the taxes are all
paid and the interest-free loan is repaid. The
farmers are subsisting on these loans they
have been receiving. The loans are welcome,
of course, but the farmers will never get anywhere carrying on in that manner.
Moreover, the value of farm lands in the
West bas gone down within the last year and
a half by 30 to 50 per cent. I shall deal with
that later. Retail business is also down from
30 ta 50 per cent. Sales of farm machinery,
farm equipment and farm supplies are way
down. Most dealers are in trouble and many
will be unable to stay in business. Unemployment is increasing rapidly. Farmers who have
any money are caught in the cost-price
squeeze brought on by inflation, a problem
which was capably dealt with by honourable
Senator Roebuck in his speech yesterday afternoon. Sales of motor vehicles are down to
zero. Sales of consumer goods of every kind
are way down. Farmers are generally good
spenders, but when sales of wheat and other
farm produce are down the farmers have no
money to spend. As a consequence the entire
Canadian economy will suffer, because most
of the things that the farmer requires, such as
household
goods, furniture, automobiles,
trucks, seeders, harrows, cultivators, radios,
television sets, refrigerators and a host of
other goods are manufactured in the east and
shipped west for sale. The loss of such sales
will soon become noticeable.
I have in my hand a clipping from yesterday's Globe and Mail entitled: "Trouble in
East Predicted from Western Farms Depression." It reads:
Special to the Globe and Mail
Regina-All of Canada, particularly the
East, may be in deeper economie trouble
than it realizes because of the economic
depression of the farm industry in Western Canada, in the view of E. K. Turner,
president of the Saskatchewan Wheat
Pool.
Wheat exports in recent years have
accounted for 42 per cent of Canada's
foreign exchange earnings, Mr. Turner
said in an interview. Because of the drop
in wheat export sales this year, the earnings share has declined by half from the
corresponding period last year. He gave
no figures.

November 19, 1969

SENATE DEBATES

Mr. Turner estimates that every dollar
earned by wheat sales generates another
$3 of gross national product. Some economists have put the figure at $6.
I will not read of the entire article, but it
shows that the drop in income of the farmers
in western Canada to practically nothing is
already being felt in the East. The situation
will get worse, I think, as time goes on.
In an ordinary crop year in the West, the
wheat crop grown by the farmers constitutes
a billion dollar increase in our national product. If it cannot be sold, it creates difficulties
for everyone. I am sorry to report that, in my
opinion, it does not look as if the situation
will improve in the very near future. Solutions are not easy, but when the western
Wheat Pool officials met the Prime Minister
in July last they outlined a plan for shortterni and long-term aid.
I have in my hand an article which
appeared in the Saskatchewan Business Journal of October 17, 1969, entitled "Agriculture
in a Crisis". This article sets out in detail the
short-terni and long-term suggestions which
were made by the Wheat Pool officials and
other farn organizations when they met with
the Prime Minister. I would read first the
short-terni suggestions:
1. An immediate payment to grain producers based on 1968-69 cultivated acreage of $2 an acre up to $2,000 maximum.
2. Guaranteed floor price on export
wheat of not less than the present International Grains Arrangement minimum
of $1.954 basis No. 1 Northern at the
Lakehead.
3. Sales of all wheat for domestic
human consumption from the Canadian
Wheat Board be at a price of $2.954
per bushel.
Then it goes on to state the long-terni
suggestions:
1. A four-year commitment by the federal government of $160 million in 1970,
to be used for assistance, development
and adjustment of the prairie farn
economy. Further it was suggested that
$120 million be provided in 1971, $80 million in 1972, and progressively lower, $40
million in 1973.
2. A capital fund in addition for purchase of small, uneconomic farms on the
voluntary decision of the farmer.
According to Mr. Turner, President of the
Saskatchewan Wheat Pool, Mr. Trudeau did

not make ýany commitment on hearing these
proposals, but he said that they had a good
reception and they were optinistic that, when
the Prime Minister had time to digest the
proposals, some federal aid would be
forthcoming.
Al this relates to the speech which the
Prime Minister made in Winnipeg with
respect to it "not being his function to sell the
wheat for the farming community".
As Senator Argue so clearly said, the Government came forward with certain emergency measures, as follows:
First, the continuation of interest-free cash
advances on farm stored grain and on
unthreshed grain lying out in the fields. There
is some of that now in the northern part of
the provinces of Alberta, Saskatchewan and
Manitoba.
Secondly, a modified two-price system for
wheat purchased and consumed in Canada.
Thirdly, promises to increase Canada's
food-aid progran by providing mostly wheat
and/or fiour to the value of $85 million a
year, instead of the $65 million which we
have been setting aside for the purpose.
Fourthly, supporting the Wheat Board's
selling program to developing countries,
making money available to take care of interest rates paid by the Wheat Board on credit
sales made to foreign countries.
In addition, at those delivery points which
had only been able to take a four-bushel
quota last year, it was suggested that the crop
year be extended long enough for them to
market the other one bushel per acre.
Honourable senators, all of this was very
acceptable and much appreciated, but in my
opinion and in the opinion of the farmers of
Western Canada, it did not go nearly far
enough. They were emergency measures only,
designed to meet the present agricultural
situation. The Western Producer, a newspaper
published in the Province of Saskatchewan
and owned by the Wheat Pool, says that this
does not make a wheat policy, that there are
no guidelines for the farmers to follow.
It is true that we did diversify our operations to a certain extent. In west central Saskatchewan, where I live, practically every
farmer, instead of growing all wheat as he
had been doing in the past, grew a field or
two of fiax, a field or two of durum wheatthat is the macaroni wheat-a field of oats,
and perhaps only one small field of spring
wheat. That was a great help. In addition, by

SENATE DEBATES
summer fallowing more than usual, we are
doing all we can to take care of the situation.
This article indicates further that the
absence in a wheat policy of a reasonably
guaranteed minimum price puts the Canadian
producer at a serious disadvantage in a competitive world market, where every other
country enjoys the protection of a guaranteed
floor price. Actually, honourable senators, the
selling of the farmers' wheat is the No. 1
problem and it must be solved if at al
possible.
Honourable Senator Martin will know what
I am referring to when I say that when
George Hees was Minister of Trade and Commerce I thought he did a very fine job,
particularly when he called to Ottawa all the
trade commissioners from every part of the
world where we had them stationed, and
educated them on what to do and what we
had to sell, and then sent them back. As a
result, we sold a lot of wheat and a lot of
manufactured goods. I think that is one thing
that should be done right now without further delay.
This picture that I have painted, honourable senators, is a rather gloomy one. It is
almost as gloomy as the picture that Senator
Roebuck painted for us the other day when
he was telling us about the effects of inflation
and the value of the Canadian dollar. But in
spiLe of what Senator Argue said and in spite
of what I have said, I am not as pessimistic as
some people seem to be.
Hon. Mr. Martin: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: I have lived in the Province of Saskatchewan since 1911. A number
of times I have seen crops almost wiped out
by drought. Other times I have seen unsold
wheat piled up on the farms. But, eventually,
whether it was on account of the war or not,
that piled-up wheat disappeared; it found a
market.
I have seen the price of farm land go up
and fall back; go up again and fall back
again. I have seen this happen five times
during the time I have been there. But, eventually, the price seems to go high enough, and
people think that that is what it is worth, and
they are willing to sell their land to get some
money to help them in their old age. However, when the value of farm land comes
back to where it was a couple of years ago,
which is its true selling value, I do not think
any of the farmers will want to pay a big
capital gains tax on the difference between
the present value of the land and what it may
[Hon. Mr. Aseltine.]

November 19, 1969

be two or three years from now. They will
object strongly to that.
In the meantime, while we are waiting for
things to improve, and waiting for the Government to do something, I think that all we
can possibly do is to tighten our belts, sow
less spring wheat, sow more flax and oil
seeds, and carry on as usual.
Some people say we should go into the
cattle business on a big scale. The Saskatchewan government has made arrangements to
lend money to farmers to help them build up
a herd, but there are certain areas in the
western provinces which are not conducive
to good cattle raising. There is the water
supply, for one thing; moreover, if all our
farmers went into the cattle raising business,
we would end up by raising enough cattle to
supply the whole North American continent,
and that would not be a good thing.
There are certain areas, such as the Rosetown area, the Kindersley and the Eston area,
the Regina plains and the Moose Jaw area,
where the soil is what is known as gumbo.
The top soil in those areas is in some places
50 feet deep, and that land will be growing
wheat when other areas which are not as
suitable for wheat have been turned into
mixed farming, including cattle raising, sheep
raising and hog raising and so on. So I do not
expect those good areas to give up the growing of wheat. I think that most of the wheat
that we will be growing for export and for
domestic use in the future will be grown in
those areas, and the other areas will be used
for general mixed farming.
Honourable senators, that is about all I
have to say about the farming situation in the
western provinces. I think it is clear from
what I have stated that there is a crisis at the
present moment, something that we will have
to work out of by planning and doing things
differently.
Honourable senators, I come back to the
Speech from the Throne where I find the
following passage, referring to the white
papers which the Government is going to
distribute:
During this session a number of reports
and white papers will be presented as
part of a comprehensive revision of Government policy. You will thus be invited
to examine the Government's findings
concerning external affairs, defence, tax
reform, citizenship, social security, information, and postal service.
I intended to say something about the setting up of a committee to study the White

November 19, 1969

SENATE DEBATES

Paper on Taxation, a copy of which I have in
my hand, and which is entitled "Proposals for
Tax Reform." I was of the opinion after
studying the proposals, and I am sure other
honourable senators who have been studying
them have found the same thing, that the
proposals are very new, complicated and controversial. That is why I strongly advocate
the setting up of a joint committee of the
Senate and the House of Commons. As I said
when speaking on the leader's motion earlier
this afternoon, I am of the opinion that we
have so many tax experts in the Senate that
it would be very wise to have about ten of
them on such a joint committee. I am still of
the opinion that a joint committee would be
much better than a single committee in each
house. It would save duplication.
I had intended asking the Leader of the
Government to advocate the setting up a joint
committee. However, we have now agreed to
have our own committee to study these
proposals. I am a member of that committee
and have been for years. It is a good committee. We have a fine chairman who is a tax
expert in his own right, and I am sure we
will do a good job, but that does not mean
that I have been won over entirely from the
idea of having a joint committee. However, I
am willing to go along with my colleagues
and I know we will do the best we can.
Hon. Mr. Martin: You will be a good
member of that committee.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: As Senator Roebuck has
said, it is very likely that we will have entirely different views from those of a committee
of the other place. I am quite sure we will
have.
Honourable senators, I am much disturbed
by this proposal to tax capital gains because
in my view it is a proposal to tax assets. I
notice that the Premier of the Province of
Saskatchewan is also very much disturbed
about this matter. In an interview some days
ago, he said that he would send a delegation
to Ottawa to appear before a joint committee
or before any other committee, and that he
would probably head that delegation himself.
Apparently he is very much disturbed over
the proposal to tax capital gains in so far as
they affect farm lands when they are sold. On
page 38 of the White Paper I find the
following:
The government does not propose to tax
gains that arise before the new system is
introduced unless those gains would have
been taxed under the present systen.

Consequently, the general rule would be
that taxpayers could deduct from the
proceeds of sale of assets the value of
those assets on "valuation day".
Reading a little farther I find this:
The natural and ordinary thing to do
would be to proclaim that valuation day
is to be the day on which the new systein
is to begin.
In other words, the capital gains tax would
not be retroactive. In my opinion that means
that on valuation day every asset of personal
property or real property must be valued.
Perhaps there would not be much difficulty in
valuing personal property, but when you
come to valuing real property you are in
trouble. There does not appear to be any
formula for valuing such real property, and I
think that a formula should be included in
the legislation when it is brought down in the
form of a bill. Even then, it would be almost
impossible due to the fact that, as stated
previously, farm lands have gone up and
down in value five times in my experience,
and in the last two years values have gone
down by 30 to 50 per cent. That means that
when this becomes law and the valuation day
is fixed, land will be valued as at that time
even though it has gone down in value 30 or
50 per cent, and if the taxpayer sells it he
pays capital gains tax on the difference
between its value on valuation day and its
value when it is sold.
That is not so bad, but there is something
else that has been worrying many people in
the West. We have farmers there who are
retiring and who want to sell their land and
have something to live on without having to
pay substantial capital gains tax. As you
know, honourable senators, when the amount
of excess is arrived at, that amount is added
to the total income of the taxpayer as of the
date of sale and it increases the percentage of
his tax until it reaches a maximum of 50 per
cent. In other words, it becomes income.
Now, as I have said, I am not so very
worried about that. We will have to get
around it in some way or other. But what
happens when a man makes a will and leaves
a farm to his wife or to his son? There is no
capital gains tax on that until the beneficiary
sells it. Then when the beneficiary does sell it
they do not take the value of the farm as of
valuation date, but they go back 30 or 40
years to what it cost the farmer when he
bought it, and the difference between what it
originally cost the farmer and what it sells

SENATE DEBATES

for now is capital gains and is added to his
taxable income. That is what we are objecting to, even though there is something in the
White Paper to the effect that the tax will
only be on the difference between what
succession duty or estate tax was paid and
the amount of the capital gain.
Honourable senators, I know of hundreds of
people who have invested in farmland and
have been either farming the land themselves
and living on the land or operating it from
their home in town, or having somebody else
farm it for them and sharing the crops. This
is going to be a very serious matter for people
who have their money invested in that way
and obtain a substantial income from the
farmland. In my opinion, it smacks of
confiscation.
Honourable senators, these are matters
which I hope our Banking, Trade and Commerce Committee will look into carefully
when the matter comes before them for
consideration.
Hon. Donald A. McLean: Honourable senators, I join with others who have spoken in
this debate in extending my congratulations
to the mover and seconder of this motion for
an Address in Reply to the Speech from the
Throne. Their speeches were excellent and
well deserving of praise.
I sit here surrounded by many eminent
speakers and I am quite reluctant to rise on
the last day of this debate to offer my few
remarks with reference to the Speech from
the Throne.
At home on Sunday mornings I listen to a
very interesting television program featuring
Rex Humbard, and last Sunday he had on his
program an evangelist from the mid-western
states who was preaching the old-time religion. He said that he went into taverns,
nightclubs and other such places to preach
the gospel. Rex Humbard asked him, "Why
do you go into these places to preach the
gospel? Why do you go into restaurants
where there are topless waitresses?" He
replied, "I go in there to get down to the bare
facts."
Honourable senators, although I am reluctant to speak in this chamber on the last day
of this debate, I want to get down to the bare
facts. I was born on a farm in Cape Breton
and the first instrument I was given to use
was a shovel-and you know what that is
used for. That shovel taught no oratorical
lessons. I went on from there to milking a
cow. That had no oratorical lessons to teach,
[Hon. Mr. Aseltine.]

November 19, 1969

but it did give me strong wrists and hands.
However, that was not enough by which to
earn a living, so I had to go on to something
else.
During the course of this debate we have
talked of poverty and many other things, but
what is poverty? Why should we have poverty in the midst of plenty? I do not see why
poverty should exist in this country. I know
the difference between poverty and being
poor. I was brought up damned poor, but
when one speaks of poverty one thinks of a
person without clothing, shelter or food. We
have millions of bushels of wheat in the west,
and thousands of barrels of potatoes and
large quantities of fish in the east. It is just a
matter of distribution.
When I was a boy I went to the grist mill
with oats, wheat and buckwheat, and
returned home with enough flour and oatmeal to do us all winter. We ate oatmeal
porridge in the morning and buckwheat porridge at night. If we did not work, we did not
eat.
A great deal of training needs to be done in
our country. We need more research into the
management and distribution of food. Food is
plentiful in Canada, but it is not distributed
properly.
As His Excellency the Governor General
said in the Speech from the Throne, inflation
is the most serious obstacle to the achievement of our economic goals and is also the
most difficult to control.
Inflation is an insidious evil for all, but it is
particularly so for those whose incomes are
low, because even a modest increase in price
levels causes hardships for pensioners, the
unemployed, persons on welfare and others
unable to increase their incomes. The recognition of the hardships which the rise in the cost
of living during the past four years has
caused, and is causing, has effected a change
in the
Government's
attitude towards
increased expenditures and the resultant deficits. Also the course of events in the fields of
wages and costs of production, heavily
influenced as these were by the general atmosphere of inflation, has played a part in this
change of attitude. Major increases in prices
and costs are diluting the prosperity achieved
since the beginning of the decade, and the
costs of continued inflation are huge and may
ultimately be reflected in an impairment of
the country's competitive position. The agreements reached in the dock workers' and the
St. Lawrence Seaway workers' strikes in
1966, in the airline strike in 1968, and so on,

November 19, 1969

SENATE DEBATES

all contributed to the inflation psychosis
which has gripped the country.
Mr. Louis Rasminsky, the Governor of the
Bank of Canada, in November 1967 warned
that governments were spending and borrowing too much, and urged management and
labour to act with restraint and prudence. He
also urged public opinion to become a potent
force in moderating pressure by insisting that
incomes keep in step with output, and he told
investors that, in seeking to protect themselves against high interest rates, they were
forcing up rates. Mr. Rasminsky believes that
public opinion can exert pressures on the
economy by keeping increases in incomes
closer to what the economy can really back
up in the form of goods. If we increase incomes more rapidly than we increase production, then costs and prices are bound to go
up. If there is not appropriate restraint and
prudence on the part of all governments,
management and labour, then we shall have
to adjust in other more painful ways, such
as more unemployment and unused economic
capacity, to cool off the economy.
Our Prime Minister, in his expenditures
guidelines statement of August 13, has shown
the Government's willingness to combat inflation by cutting its expenditures and urging
the provinces to do their share in the fight
against inflation by controlling the size of
federal expenditures made to the provinces,
which is the most rapidly rising part of government expenditures, for such things as
equalization payments, shared cost programs
like hospital services, the operating costs of
post-secondary education, et cetera. Federal
expenditures will be cut by reductions in the
federal payroll and defence costs, and a
review of old and new programs and activities, but the aim is not to curtail essential
government services for the people but to
perform those services more efficiently, and to
institute a minimum of new priority programs for those Canadians and regions in real
need of social and economic help.
The Financial Times of September 22
editorializes that price stability is not an
alternative to the growth of output and
employment. It is the essential condition for
growth; it is not a threat to the poor, but
their only hope of improving their lot. It is
true that fiscal and monetary restraints may
produce slack in the economy before they
make any substantial dint in rising prices.
But it does not follow that the restraints
should be removed whenever economists,
politicians, or businessmen think they see

some signs that there might be some slowdown next year or the year after. We have
been around that circle at least twice in the
sixties, even as late as the summer of 1968.
The only result of relaxing too soon is to
intensify the inflationary forces and make
them even harder to beat later on.
Dr. John Young, Chairman of the Prices and
Incomes Commission, argues that unless those
who feed off inflation get a real jolt, price
and cost pressures will remain a permanent
fixture in the economy. The Prime Minister
has said that his Government intends to cooperate to the fullest with the commission
in the development of a set of voluntary constraints on prices and incomes for 1970. It
must be stated here that labour leaders do not
agree that voluntary guidelines can cope
effectively with the current inflation. Donald
MacDonald, President of the Canadian
Labour Congress, and Marcel Pepin, President of the Confederation of National Trade
Unions, in their joint press conference on
October 17, claimed that there needed to be
restraints on all non-wage and salary forms
of income including profits, rents, interest,
professional fees, unincorporated business
income, speculation in real estate prices, et
cetera. They concluded that it is impossible to
bring these forms of income "under a meaningful policy" of voluntary restraint.
The Economic Council takes the view that
Canada cannot do substantially better on
prices than the United States, and that the
causes of inflation have changed significantly
since the mid-1960s. The problem then was
excess demand, but it is difficult to say that
this still applies, since the Canadian economy
bas had at least a moderate margin of slack
since 1967. The United States, however, is
still suffering from excess demand, fanned by
the pressures of Vietnam, and its prices have
been rising faster than Canada's. In the view
of the Economic Council, until United States
price pressures ease Canadian efforts to fight
inflation at home will be handicapped. The
Government is putting more weight on the
costs of inflation and less on the risks of
unemployment than the Economic Coundil
would like. The council suggests that last
year's 20 per cent increase in unit profits in
manufacturing was "inappropriate," and says
some prices must fall if the overall advance
in prices is to slow down. It calls for major
new initiatives to solve the problems of small
scale, poor management, restrictive labour
practices, inadequate research, backward
technology, land speculation, and obstructive
building and zoning codes that add to costs

SENATE DEBATES
and cut productivity in the housebuilding
industry.
The goals most warmly advocated by the
Council-maximum economic growth, maximum opportunity for personal development,
and drastic reduction in poverty-are irrefutable. They are also unattainable until the
fight against inflation is won.
In Washington, the war against inflation

problems are those concerning student unrest
and racial unrest.
So, the value of dialogue must be apparent
to all senators, and it has been the theme of a
good many speeches, either directly or by
implication. In fact, the honourable Leader of
the Government and one or two other senators actually used the word "dialogue" which,

November 19, 1969

SENATE DEBATES

I have made a note of some of them. For
example, Senator Aseltine spoke of the capital gains tax, particularly in relation to the
problem in the west. I can well understand
his concern in this connection. There is also a
problem which must be carefully considered
as to the form of that tax. In a sense it is
segregated from income in the United States
and is at a fixed rate depending on the length
of time that the investment is held, which is
25 per cent if it is held beyond six months,
and a gain is realized. The committee bas to
consider carefully whether or not it is in the
best interests of the country to bring the gain
into income as such. I am expressing no opinion, but I am pointing this out as a problem
which can be the subject-matter of dialogue
before that committee. I am assuming, by the
way, that the committee will have the benefit
of a good many outside experts, plus the
benefit, I can assure you, of many experts on
the committee itself, not the least of them
being, as Senator Aseltine said, the chairman
of the committee. Al these problems I have
mentioned, including capital gains, will get a
thorough airing.
The next consideration that occurred to me
was the matter of rates, particularly as they
relate to persons in the middle income bracket. It is true that on the face of it one would
certainly approve of lowering the rates on the
low income brackets, for the simple reason
that we do not want any distress in this
country.
The next question to consider is whether on
the wholè this is equitable and in the best
interests of everyone. I have in mind particularly, of course, the middle income bracket. Is
this going to help or hinder initiative which
brings about productivity? Is that not our
real problem, how to get the maximum
productivity out of the tax system? It bas
been said, sometimes in accusatory terms,
that this white paper is a social document. Of
course it is a social document. I do not think
there would be any object in anyone denying
that. It is hoped that it will bring the
greatest good to the greatest number. We
have to consider carefully, under the second
point I have been trying to make, whether the
rates are equitable in the circumstances,
particularly to the middle income group.
Again I emphasize that I am expressing no
opinion.
The next question that must be dealt with
both in the committee and in this bouse is
whether or not it is wise to do away with the

advantage to small businesses which exists
now because of the lower rate of tax on the
first $35,000 of net profit. Again I express no
opinion, but we must consider carefully what
the effect will be. Will it result in an inability
on the part of energetic people to commence a
business and make it grow into something
worthwhile which has real productivity? This
is a problen which I am sure is going to
receive a lot of attention.
By the way, speaking of dialogue and
attention, at this point I have managed to
collect two files of newspaper clippings. If
that can be termed dialogue, it has definitely
started in a big way in all of the newspapers,
the financial journals, and on radio and
television. This is good, because without that
sort of dialogue how do you get an ultimate
solution which is acceptable to everybody?
Other problems will have to be considered.
This may be a small one in a sense, but it
is not small to some people. It is the proposal
to eliminate as deductible all convention
expenses. Is that the right thing to do?
Conventions are big business to some communities. There are various types of conventions. Some, I admit, lend themselves to
abuse; others are calculated to increase
knowledge. It will have to be carefully considered whether this particular tax proposal
is too sweeping and should be modified.
Expense account living is a problem that
must receive attention from the committee
and from this House, as well as from the
other place. It is proposed, of course, to do
away with deductibility of club dues entirely.
I admit that probably there have been some
abuses in that connection, and also in general
in the operation of expenses, and so on. As
someone who has had some experience in the
tax field, I think the Department of National
Revenue, in its usual efficient manner, has
managed pretty well to control that situation
lately, and they deserve full marks for that.
However, perhaps there are still some abuses;
I do not know. Nevertheless, we will have
to consider carefully in committee whether or
not to eliminate as deductible all club dues
and all convention expenses.
This is the sort of thing that can be the
subject matter of dialogue, that can be solved
only after hearing opinions from all sides. It
would be a great mistake, I think, for anyone
to try to be dogmatic at this stage and say
this is the way it should be done. There is a

SENATE DEBATES

long way to go. This will not become law for
over a year. In the meantime there will be
ample opportunity for discussion. As an aside,
I would point out that the local newspaper
back home, the Windsor Star, carried an
item, which I must admit appeared with my
full consent, suggesting that I would be
pleased to receive the views of anybody on
the white paper. I may add that I have been
receiving them. I think this is the way it
should be done. It is a bit of a burden, poring
over a lot of letters, but how else can one get
at what the public thinks about these matters,
and how else can one get a consensus of
opinion, which is essential if we are to have a
successful tax system, or any other system for
that matter.
I must admit that I am in no position to
discuss the details surrounding the proposals
on the mining and petroleum industries. All I
say is that we must consider carefully whether or not the opposition that obviously exists
to the proposals has any merit.
Although many other things arise out of
the white paper, one further thought occurring to me is that we must carefully consider
whether the white paper is doing the right
thing when it comes to encouraging foreign
investment. After all, it is perhaps true that
the white paper does something appealing in
the sense that it is positive in encouraging
Canadians to invest in Canadian enterprise.
Let us be frank about it. I like this positive
approach better than the negative approach
we had a while back. We must, therefore,
carefully examine that aspect. I suppose, too,
capital gains comes into that picture. Are
we doing the right thing to encourage foreign
investment?
All these problems will have to be the subject of discussion in committee and in this
house. To have complete agreement on everything would certainly be a sign of a stagnant
society, and it would not be right if there
were no protests. For example, our own
Prime Minister said of protesters:

YUKON PLACER MINING ACT
BILL TO AMEND-SECOND READING
DEBATE ADJOURNED

Hon. W. M. Benidickson moved the second
reading of Bill S-4, to amend the Yukon
Placer Mining Act.
He said: Honourable senators, while we are
dealing with an act of long standing and of a
considerable number of sections, 89 or 90 in
all, the Yukon Placer Mining Act, which has
been on the statute book for a long time, I
suggest that the amendments are not of great
moment. They involve amendments to only
two sections of the basic statute. It is my
proposal that after debate on second reading,
if second reading is approved, the bill be
referred to the Standing Senate Committee on
Banking, Trade and Commerce. I think there
is a precedent for this in connection with
territorial matters in the north. The Senate
addressed itself in 1967-68 to the Territorial
Lands Act and other related statutes, and the
bill was referred to the Banking, Trade and
Commerce Committee. I think that is the
appropriate committee to consider the amendments now before us.
Without attempting to be technical or delay
the Senate, I should give you a general outline of what is proposed in these amendments.
As I said, two of the sections are amended
and one additional clause is being added to
the old statute. The Yukon Placer Mining
Act, which provides for the administration of
placer mining rights in the Yukon Territory,
was approved by Parliament in 1906. Since
that time,, only minor amendments have been
made to the act, the last of which was authorized in 1952. The amendment being sought
now simply provides for multi-purpose utilization of the land surface where practical
within the Yukon Territory.
Honourable
senators will, of course,
remember the great Klondike rush of 1896,
but from 1898 until after World War II, placer
mining played a major part in the economy of
the Yukon Territory. The highest productive
years were 1901 and 1902 when about one
and a half million ounces of gold were recovered each year from this form of mining. In

November 19, 1969

SENATE DEBATES

1966, when recovery of gold in this manner
became uneconomic. Today, activity is on a
very small scale. I am told that it comprises
perhaps 30 small operations, each involving
only one or two personnel, so that we are not
talking about interfering with the mining
industry.
As a former Minister of Mines, I would not
be proposing this legislation if I felt it was
deleterious to mining operations in this part
of our land. Perhaps because placer mining
was the prime industry at the time the act
was drafted, only lands within the boundaries
of a city, town, or village, or lands occupied
by a building or forming part of an Indian
reserve were protected from multi-utilization.
The act makes no provision to withdraw from
its application lands that may be required in
this modern age for public purposes, such as
harbours, airfields, roads, bridges, national
parks, historic sites and game sanctuaries.
The essence of the proposed amendments is
to authorize exceptions in order to provide
protection for utilization of these lands, aside
from mining claims for these public purposes.
The purpose of the amendments to sections 17
and 19, and the addition of a new section 93,
is to provide for other circumstances additional to those now stated in the act, where it
is desirable to restrict placer mining and to
provide authority to control placer mining
where land is required for a public purpose.
The restriction on the disposal of ownership
of the surface of the claim is removed to
permit multi-purpose use of the surface
where practical. The industry will not be
restricted by the proposed amendments. The
amendments are not retroactive and cannot

therefore affect existing rights of claim holders under the old regulations of placer
mining.
Honourable senators, I suggest that this updating of the act, which provides for certain
land areas to be restricted in terms of placer
mining, is not inconsistent with existing provincial legislation applicable elsewhere; for
example, in British Columbia under its provincial mining regulations, and in Ontario
and Quebec.
The details of this bill, for which there are
adequate explanatory notes, can be examined
in committee. I understand that the Chairman
of the Banking, Trade and Commerce Committee will make his committee available for
this purpose next week, and if the bill is
given second reading I propose to move that
it be referred to that committee.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Haig, debate

SENATE DEBATES
Pitts Life Insurance Company was incorporated on March 1, 1963, under the Ontario
Corporations Act. Pitts Insurance Company
was incorporated under the Ontario Corporations Act on July 5, 1956. Both companies are
relatively new in their fields. The principal
place of business of both companies is the
same, namely, the City of London, Ontario.
Their head offices are both maintained in that
city. Both companies, since they were incorporated and commenced carrying on business
under their Ontario charters, have enjoyed
considerable success, in fact, I would say
quite substantial success considering the surplus
positions
which
the
companies
accumulated within this relatively short
period of time. The life insurance company
commenced business in 1963 with a paid-up
capital cf $260,000. It has had a record of
continuoas profitability, even during its startup years, which is quite an accomplishment
in this field, and it has grown to a point
where its capital and surplus now total in
excess of $1 million. Similarly, the general
insurance company started in 1956 with a
capital of $100,000. It has grown to a combined capital and surplus figure today in
excess of $600,000.
I should mention that these are whollyowned Canadian companies. In fact all the
shareholders of both companies are with very
few exceptions employees of the companies.
We have here a management-ownership
proposition. Both companies do a large part
of their business in Ontario, Quebec, New
Brunswick and Alberta, through general
agents in those provinces. It is their inability
to do business in Newfoundland, Nova Scotia
and Manitoba in particular, together with the
continued growth of the companies and a considerable loss of business through their inability to enter these provinces, which bas
prompted this application for federal incorporation. In fact, honourable senators will recall
that the amendments to the Canadian and
British Insurance Companies Act, which
today passed third reading, make provision
for the incorporation of these companies by
Letters Patent under that act. This application was started some time ago on the
assumption that that bill would become law.
It not having yet become law, and in the
event that it does not become law within the
reasonably near future, the applicants have
brought forward this petition for statutory
incorporation.
[Hon. Mr. Lang.]

November 20, 1969

With federal incorporation both these companies will immediately extend their business
throughout Canada where referred to heretofore. They plan within approximately three
years to enter the United States market,
should business considerations be favourable
at that time. The companies are managed by
the applicants set forth in the petitions, who
are business and professional men in the City
of London and the immediate area. They
enjoy a high reputation in the business community of that city and its environs. The
affairs of both companies have been scrutinized by the Department of Insurance and
are in a position to meet the requirements
respectively of capital and surplus as set
forth in the bills.
If these bills receive second reading, I will
ask that they be referred to the Standing
Senate Committee on Banking, Trade and
Commerce, where officials of the department
will be available to give evidence of the
suitability of these companies to carry on
business as applied for.
There is an error in clause 7 of Bill S-10.
The surplus requirement referred to in that
clause should read "one hundred thousand
dollars", not "five hundred thousand dollars."
At this time I merely draw attention to the
error and to the fact that I will be moving an
amendment to rectify it before the committee.
Honourable senators, I commend Bill S-10
for your favourable consideration.

SENATE DEBATES

QUARANTINE BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. Donald Smith moved the second reading of Bill S-12, to prevent the introduction
into Canada of infectious or contagious
diseases.
He said: Honourable senators, you will
have noticed by the front page of the bill that
it is entitled, "An Act to prevent the introduction into Canada of infectious or contagious diseases." As that formal title suggests
the prevention of such diseases as foot-andmouth disease and perhaps some other plant
and animal infections, I believe we would
better understand the measure by noting the
short title, which is the Quarantine Act.
I am sure most of us are old enough to
recall quite vividly the days of quarantine
placards on the doors of houses in our own
placards
Perhaps
those
communities.
appeared in some parts of the country and
the world a lot more frequently than in
others, but most of us will remember in
our childhood at least the prevalence of such
diseases as scarlet fever and diphtheria. We
can all remember too the horrible colour-in
my province it was yellow-and the frightening looking placards by which your friends at
school were confined to their homes throughout the duration of those dreadful diseases. It
gives some of us, who perhaps now regard
ourselves as the downbeat generation, some
real degree of satisfaction to know that we do
not see such placards any more. The reasons
we do not see them are manifold, but perhaps
the important one is because many people concern themselves with medical health and public health as a branch of medicine, and others
who are responsible with the aid of the pure
scientists to overcome a great many of these
diseases which took the lives of members of
our own families and playmates when we
were young.
Now, I do not suggest that this bill has very
much to do with the diseases I men-.
tioned in passing and which were the subject of the quarantine, but there are diseases
covered by the Quarantine Act which some
of us have had experience with in our younger days. One of these is certainly smallpox.
In the early days of my own seaport town
of Liverpool, Nova Scotia-which was the
first place settlers came in 1759 after the
way was found for them by Champlain and
De Monts-there was evidence of a great
loss of life from yellow fever, another disease

which is covered in this Quarantine Act.
Some of the diaries from our early days
which I have read refer to it as "Yellow
Jack". Apparently it was a common occurrence for the seagoing men and boys of
Liverpool to contact yellow fever while on
their voyages down to the Caribbean, and it
caused a serious loss of life.
As a reminder of the great advances made
in maternal health and in many other medical
fields, one has only to walk slowly through
some of those historic graveyards to be found
in older parts of the country and read the
well-weathered inscriptions of maternal and
childhood deaths from smallpox, yellow jack
and many other epidemics.
Some years ago-I am sure it was through
the intervention on my behalf of the then
Minister of National Health and Welfare, now
the Leader of the Government in this chamber-I was able to attend a meeting in Switzerland of the World Health Organization. At
that time, with my semi-medical background
and coming from a medical family, I was very
interested in those subjects which I discovered were so well covered by the World
Health Organization, and I was impressed by
the success of its prograns to prevent the
spread of horrible diseases. Some of those are
listed in the schedule to this bill-cholera,
plague, smallpox, louse-borne relapsing fever,
typhus fever and yellow fever. We do not
hear very much of such diseases in these
days, and because we do not hear about them,
it is good news. It is another instance where
"no news is good news."
This has come about because nations have
legislation similar to Canada's Quarantine
Act, and also because of the great international effort made through the World Health
Organization. All countries must continue to
exercise the highest degree of vigilance in
these matters.
I am familiar with the port city of Halifax;
and I am sure that if honourable Senator
Isnor were with us this afternoon he would
enter this debate as a stepping stone to another speech in praise of the Port of Halifax, of
which he is very proud and where the recent
developments make him even prouder than
he has been in the past. In a port such as
Halifax there is from time to time a smallpox
scare. This usually results from the presence
of one or more suspected cases of smallpox
which the press learns are in an isolation
hospital. There have been real cases of smallpox too, but under the Quarantine Act our
attention in the Port of Halifax for some time

SENATE DEBATES

has been directed constantly towards the prevention of the spread of such horrible diseases as smallpox. That there has been no
spread of this disease is attributable to al of
the officials who give such careful attention to
this subject.
Honourable senators, the time has come to
bring this legislation up to date. I have been
told that the Quarantine Act now in effect
has lacked any substantial amendment or
modernization for upwards of fifty years. As
a result, its application to developing techniques in communications and transportation
has been difficult and at times of questionable
validity.
The present bill, which is a complete
recasting of the Quarantine Act, is designed
to reduce the chances of certain contagious
and infectious diseases entering Canada and
the hazards associated with such entry.
The principles underlying the exercise of
quarantine derive from long experience and
are based on sound medical practice. The longterm effect hoped for, through the application
of similar legislation in many countries, is the
general raising of health standards gradually
to the point where the risk of the major
diseases entering or becoming epidemic in
any country are reduced and kept at as low
an incidence as possible. In this way, the
administration of a reasonable and effective
quarantine procedure is complementary to
other public health measures in effect in the
countries concerned.
The interpretation section of this bill contains several new definitions. I would draw
your attention particularly to the definition of
"conveyance" which, for the first time,
specifically includes aircraft, trailers and
vehicles generally by which persons, goods
and cargoes are transported.
Hon. Mr. Martin: And ski-doos?
Hon. Mr. Smith: Yes. There are many other
modes of transport included, but I do not
wish to enumerate then at this time.
The degree of danger in particular diseases
alters somewhat over the long term and
according to the prevailing circumstances.
Provision is made in the bill for changes to be
made in the listing of those diseases which
shall come under the scope of the act. These
changes may be named in the schedule to the
act in future by order in council. The control
rests primarily in the administration by a
screening process, through which varying
[Hon. Mr. Smith.]

November 20, 1969

categories of persons and goods may be processed with greater or lesser facility, according
to the circumstances.
This process is implemented through the
establishment of quarantine stations at all
major ports of entry and through the designation within those quarantine stations of particular areas, called quarantine areas, where
the probability or possibility of contagion or
infection is acknowledged and where necessary inquiries and examinations can be conducted. Such quarantine areas may consist of
parts of buildings, portions of landing strips
at airports, or other well marked and defined
areas, entrance to and exit from which are
controlled.
It was and must continue to be the case
that certain ports of entry be designated as
quarantine stations, in the operation of which
quarantine officers are given specific authority. This legislation permits the Minister to
make the necessary designations and provides
the necessary control over access to these
areas.
It is basically the use of these areas and the
limitations on access thereto that provide the
primary means of overseeing the entry into
Canada of persons or goods and the means of
obtaining, with reasonable satisfaction, assurance that diseases are not being permitted to
enter the country.
The day-to-day work of administering
quarantine legislation is carried out by a
large number of persons designated as quarantine officers and who, in that capacity, are
given the minimum of authority necessary to
carry out their duties. A quarantine officer is
authorized to go on board any conveyance
and inspect it and its cargo. He is also given
authority to require the person in charge of
the conveyance to produce documents for
inspection relating to matters dealt with in
the act.
There is also authority to detain in a quarantine area any such conveyance and any
cargo until the quarantine officer is satisfied
that the requirements of the act have been
complied with.
In addition to boarding and inspecting and
examining documents, it will obviously be
necessary on occasion to require certain
remedial measures before permitting a conveyance to leave a quarantine area. Provision
is made for authority to a quarantine officer
for such purposes.
The bill also contains the authority necessary to control the entry into Canada of diseases carried by persons. It is doubtful, in my

November 20, 1969

SENATE DEBATES

opinion, which of the two is the more important. One is probably as important as the
other. If a quarantine officer believes, on reasonable grounds, that a person is ill or may
have a prescribed disease or be the carrier of
it, he may request such person to undergo
medical examination forthwith.
If such person refuses a medical examination or, having undergone such examination,
is suspected of having or carrying a proscribed disease, a quarantine officer may
detain the person in a quarantine station or
hospital or on the vessel on which he travelled to Canada for a period not exceeding
the incubation period of the suspected disease. In the alternative, and in the discretion
of the quarantine officer, he may allow that
person to leave the quarantine station if he
signs an undertaking to report to a medical
officer of health for a limited period, if he
submits to vaccination for the suspected disease, or signs an undertaking and submits to
be vaccinated.
While all the sections designed to control
the entry of persons suspected of having
infectious or contagious diseases are newly
drafted, the principles involved are not new
but bave been at the root of quarantine control for a great many years. Generally speaking, the effect of these sections corresponds to
that of provisions contained in similar legislation enacted by most countries of the world
having a basic awareness of public health and
a common desire to reduce the incidence of
these dangerous diseases.
Provisions have been designed of necessity
to continue the minute but, where necessary,
thorough investigation of the disease-carrying
potential inherent in inward-bound traffic in
goods and persons. The very nature of the
control problem, depending for its effectiveness on the removal of every known or suspected incidence of disease, entails, obviously,
some encroachment on personal and property
rights of the individual. It cannot be
otherwise.
The rationale, of course, is that if these
legislative authorities are exercised with
intelligence and in a conscientious manner,
the imposition against the person is nominal,
compared with the possible injury to that
person and others which it is reasonable to
expect would result from any less effective
investigative measures.
There are, of course, hundreds of ports of
entry into Canada-many of them inland-

and to maintain in each one a qualified medical practitioner is impracticable. For this
reason, it is proposed to continue the arrangement whereby customs officers at ports of
entry where a quarantine station has not
been established may carry out primary control measures.
There is a high degree of complexity in the
arrangements that must be made for the control of the high volume of traffie continuously
entering into Canada. This traffic consists of
pedestrians, motor vehicle traffic, trucks,
buses, trains, ships and cargo and passenger
aircraft. The establishment of procedures for
this purpose must, of necessity, correspond to
and alter from time to time in accordance
with changing technological and commercial
practices.
For this reason, and because of the detail
involved, it is necessary to give the Governor
in Council at least a minimum of authority to
establish the necessary machinery by means
of regulation.
In designing the present bill, note has been
taken of the fact that the Quarantine Act, to
be repealed by this bill, consists almost
entirely of regulation-making sections. Care
has been taken to include in the basic legislation itself in the new draft every possible
provision for the implementation of the measure, leaving to subordinate legislation, in the
form of regulations, only the remaining minimum which upon consideration is deemed
essential.
The present quarantine regulations consisting of some 75 or 80 sections will, of course,
need to be revised, such revisions having
effect simultaneously with the coming into
force of this act. As a result of this revision,
it should be possible to confine such subordinate legislation to a fraction of its present
extent.
The structure of this bill has been designed
with a view to utilizing any necessary regulation-making authority for the purpose of
reducing to a minimum any inconvenience or
imposition inherent in effective quarantine
control. It is of course necessary to maintain
control in the implementation of quarantine
measures and, for this purpose, violations of
the provisions of the legislation or failure to
comply with authoritative orders of quarantine officers are made offences punishable on
summary conviction.

SENATE DEBATES
It will be remembered that the maximum
penalty for conviction of an offence on summary conviction is a fine of $500, or imprisonment for six months, or both. A person in
charge of a conveyance who similarly violates
the legislation or fails to comply with an
order is guilty of an indictable offence and is
liable to a maximum fine of $2,000, or imprisonment for one year, or both. These are maximum penalties in both cases, and lesser
penalties could be imposed.
In making the distinction between individuals entering into Canada and persons in
charge of conveyancep. cognizance is taken of
the magnitude of the harm that could result
from the introduction into the country of
members of persons or quantities of cargo, as
distinct from that which might enter through
the improper action of the single individual.
The act is to come into force on
proclamation.
Honourable senators, perhaps I have gone
into too much detail, but this is a voluminous
subject. I have tried my best to condense it,
and I appreciate the advice I received from
my leader and others with regard to the
more essential matters I should cover.
I should like to indicate that it is my intention, if this bill receives second reading, to
refer it to the appropriate committee.

November 20, 1969

do not understand too clearly myself. Perhaps
it is a subject that will be taken up by the
committee.
I think there are various opinions about
whether immigrants coming to Canada and
having the tuberculosis test may from the

medical point of view have a scar that dates
back ten years which may show that there is
an immunity which the person has derived
from having had contact with tuberculosis.
Yet, it causes a great deal of heart-rending to
families when one member of the family is
debarred from coming to Canada because of
the results of the tuberculosis examination. I
understand that even in the medical profession there is controversy as to whether this
constitutes a valid ground for debarring
people from entering Canada. I am sure that
at this time we are all concerned, and do not

I would imagine that if the honourable

SENATE DEBATES

Hon. Arthur W. Roebuck: Referring to my
friend's question as to the attitude of the
Immigration Department in this connection,
may I say that I have had several cases where
proposed immigrants have shown evidence of
previous infection of tuberculosis and who
wished to join their families in Canada. In the
Province of Ontario-and I do not know if
this has been the case in other provincesarrangements have been made whereby the
party could come to Canada on condition that
arrangements were made for the immigrant
to enter a hospital here and obtain a certificate from the medical authorities that he or
she is no longer in danger of spreading infection to others.
I have had two or three cases in which
officials of the Immigration Department
showed a great deal of understanding and
human sympathy in matters of this kind.
Immigrants have entered the country and
have gone into hospital and have been treated
for a period of time. If they had tuberculosis
and it bas been cured, they are finally
allowed to join their relatives. This arrangement gave me a great deal of satisfaction, and
I think it is something we should acknowledge with approval on the part of the
authorities.
Hon. Mr. Holleti: Honourable senators, I
have just one simple question, if the sponsor
of the bill can answer it. I refer to page 4,
section 8, subsection 2. It reads in part as
follows:
(c) a person arriving in Canada from a
place outside Canada is unable to
produce as required by the regulations
evidence satisfactory to a quarantine
officer of immunization to an infectious
or contagious disease, or
(d) a quarantine officer believes on reasonable grounds that a person at a harbour, airport or port of entry into Canada
bas been in close proximity to a person
described in subsection (1),
the quarantine officer may
(e) detain that personDoes that mean that if I go across the American border to see my son or my daughter I
may have to have a medical certificate in
order to get back into Canada?
Hon. Mr. Smith: I do not suppose that
would be the situation, because if it were
nobody could cross the border to the United
States to visit cousins or sons or brothers or

sisters. However, it does mean that if a quarantine officer suspects that a person about to
enter this country at any point of entry is
carrying or has been associated with one of
these horrible diseases listed in the schedule
to the act, he is empowered to detain that
person in the quarantine area of the quarantine station until the matter can be cleared
up. It also gives power to the customs officer
at some inland stations where they do not
have a medical practitioner acting as a quarantine officer to hold such a person until a
medical practitioner or quarantine officer can
examine that person.
I hope that will answer the question which
I think my honourable friend has in mind.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: What about dogs?
Hon. Mr. Smith: Well, dogs already have to
pass inspection. I know something about that
subject, because my daughter-in-law imports
and exports poodles.
Hon. John J. Kinley: Honourable senators,
we very much appreciate the explanation of
this bill given by my honourable friend who
comes from a part of the district which I
represent in the Senate. He was brought up
in a home in which his father was an eminent
physician and also a member of the Nova
Scotia Legislature. Our associations are of
long standing.
The senator is a dental surgeon and weil
qualified to interpret the bill now before the
bouse. I have had a long experience as a
pharmacist, and naturally I too am interested
in public health. Our experience was in the
historic towns of Lunenburg and Liverpool in
Nova Scotia, from where our sea-going people
sailed and did business in many countries,
and where they were exposed to different
climates and living conditions. Senator Smith
was telling of the diseases that were epidemic
in those days, and he mentioned especially
yellow fever. My father contracted yellow
fever on board ship in the tropics, but he was
young and vigorous and recovered. However,
he bore the effects for many years. Many
ports in the tropics were hotbeds for yellow
fever in those days. Older people will remember the battle there was with yellow fever
during the construction of the Panama Canal.
It was all because of mosquitoes, and it was
only after they succeeded in eliminating the
mosquitoes that the canal was completed.
At the outset of my friend's excellent
explanation of the bill he mentioned the hoofand-mouth disease. I feel sure some of the

SENATE DEBATES
older members of the Senate remember the
devastation that occurred because of that disease. It is serious because it affects our import
and export trade, and if it occurred again in
Canada the United States would immediately
quarantine us and other countries. The
Mounted Police would destroy the affected
animals in Canada and quarantine those suspected of having been exposed to the disease.
So, a return of that disease would be a serious matter for our farmers. I do not know
what preparations there are to combat the
disease nowadays, but in committee I would
like to hear something more about it.
There are other diseases in Canada we
thought we almost eliminated-venereal diseases. We find these are increasing in Canada,
despite the specifies which are used to control
them. They do not seem to be as effective as
formerly. So that is an increasing problem.
There was a plan by which doctors would
give information and by which those afflicted
would have to be registered but, in my
experience there were not many warnings
given. Those of us living in seaports, at which
ships dock after long voyages, were familiar
with the prevalence of these diseases in earlier days. I am glad to say that for many
years we saw little evidence of it, but it is
again making its appearance. We should alert
our Department of National Health and Welfare to the fact that it is reappearing, and I
think it is proper for me to say something
about it when discussing public health.
We hear much today of committees and
legislation regarding the high cost of drugs. I
have been in the drug business for a long
time. I think it is in much better shape today
than it was when I was actively engaged in it.
In earlier days you had to do many other
things to keep your business going. When you
think about what our friend bas been saying
about these diseases, such as scarlet fever and
other epidemics, you realize that if you were
unfortunate enough to contract one of them
you could be confined to bed for months or
even years. Now these diseases can be treated
and cured in a matter of weeks, and of course
time and health are of great value. Also,
when you consider the large amounts of
money that are spent on research and the
development of medicines and drugs, it shows
that we are making progress. Also, when you
consider the suffering and the lengthy illnesses of patients in former days, you realize
that today the situation is vastly different.
[Hon. Mr. Kinley.]

November 20, 1969

Now we have arrived at the stage when the
Government is going to look after all of us
with medicare. It appears to me that in the
days ahead we are going to experience some
difficulty in that regard, because when you do
not have to pay for treatment by a doctor
your visits to him will become more frequent.
and the physician will be overworked.
In that regard we are now told that in
addition to what they are paid through medicare, some doctors will charge a further sum
for house and office calls. I have doctors in
my own family, so I am not prejudiced
against them; indeed, we regard them highly.
However, doctors constitute the highest paid
profession in Canada today, and all the time
they are getting more for what they do. Of
course, I agree that merit should be compensated, and that the very successful man who
can do things others cannot do must be paid
accordingly. But it seems to me that in general, in Canada we should frown on the fact
that a doctor must make an extra charge
under these circumstances.
This is an interesting bill, dealing as it does
with public health, which is an important
matter. It involves those who know a great
deal about the subject and who have spent a
long time in the study and manufacture of
the drugs now being used, especially antibiotics. There is a difference of opinion among
the best physicians in this country as to the
reaction to these drugs, and we must be careful. It is comforting to know that our Department of Health is very efficient.
I have been at the United Nations several
times. On one occasion I was there when narcotics were being discussed. You are aware
that in the General Assembly the delegates
talk very generously-people like to make a
good impression on their neighbours. However, in committee it is a slightly different
matter. Each delegate knows what he wants,
and when matters are discussed in committee
one discovers what the individual delegate's
real interests are. One country may grow the
raw material for the drug; another country
may manufacture it from herbs; there are
people who trade in it; and they are all looking after their personal interests. Then, ultimately, you have to try to satisfy as many
as you can, and that is a difficult problem.
At one point in the discussion on narcotics
the Canadian delegate, who was a pharmacist
and who was playing a leading role in the
discussion, received a note from the Russian
delegate which read, "I compliment you
Canadians on the fine way you do this." We

November 20, 1869

SENATE DEBATES

thought that was a great compliment from a
man who was not in the habit of paying
compliments to the committee members.
With regard to public health, we are in a
field of mystery and experiment, a field in
which we need the best of experts giving of
their knowledge and experience. After all,
each of us has only one life to live, and a
man likes to live it in as healthy a manner
and for as long as he can. In recent years our
life expectancy has risen appreciably. In
former days a man was old at 75 years. This
has improved, and expectancy is now much
longer, largely because of the progress in
public health in all its features. Be that as it
may, the fact is that people are living longer
and at a faster pace. So, for that reason alone,
this bill is important. I hope that we shall all
attend the meeting of the committee, tell
what we know, and try to make sure that our
officials are doing a good job.
The introduction of a new drug is a very
serious matter. The drug is tested for years
before it is distributed to the public. Samples
are given to the doctors, who report their
experiences with it.
Testing is most
important.
Honourable senators will recall the tragedy
of thalidomide in the United States. It was a
nurse who fought against its use, and who
really saved the United States from the
effects of that medicine that destroyed the
limbs of unborn children. Canada did not
suffer as much, but there are many children
in Europe who are deformed because this
drug was administered to their mothers. That
nurse in the United States asserted herself
and took a chance, but she prevented the
drug finding its way into the veins of the
people of this country, and in that respect she
did us a great service.
It is to be hoped that the people in the
medical profession here are equally alertand, of course, the record of the nursing service in Canada is splendid. We do not have
sufficient doctors, and I am afraid that too
often the doctor has been the last to be paid. I
might mention here that in my community he
was the first. However, in these modern days
I think the doctors are reaching a little too
far. I am saying this because I have been
connected with the drug industry all my life.
I am a friend of the doctors, and I only give
advice when I think it is needed.

NORTH ATLANTIC ASSEMBLY
FIFTEENTH ANNUAL CONFERENCE AT
BRUSSELS, BELGIUM-DEBATE
CONTINUED

The Senate resumed fron Thursday,
November 6, the debate on the inquiry of
Hon. Mr. McDonald, calling the attention of
the Senate to the Fifteenth Annual Conference of the North Atlantic Assembly, held at
Brussels, Belgium, 16th to 21st October, 1969,
and in particular to the discussions and the
proceedings of the Conference and the participation therein of the delegation from
Canada, and to the visit of the delegation
from Canada to NATO Bases in Europe.

Hon. Hédard Robichaud: Honourable senators, I am sure you will agree with me that
there is indeed very little I can add to the
comprehensive and informative report made
to this chamber on Thursday, November 6 by
our colleague the honourable Deputy Leader
of the Government (Hon. Mr. McDonald).
Senator McDonald called the attention of the
Senate to the Fifteenth Annual Conference of
the North Atlantic Assembly held at Brussels
on October 16 to 21, and particularly to the
visit of the parliamentary delegation from
Canada to NATO bases in Europe.
Senator McDonald's description of his contacts with members of our forces in Europe
will make Canadians better informed and
fully aware of the usefulness and effectiveness of the contribution of Canadian troops
within the NATO alliance. I should like to
state at once that I am not among those who
are prepared to admit that the policy of the
Government in withdrawing some of our
troops from NATO is absolutely wrong. After
listening to the discussions which took place
at the Fifteenth Annual Conference of the
North Atlantic Assembly at Brussels, and
after having personal talks on the subject
with members of other countries present, I
am convinced now more than ever that the
role to be played by the Canadian forces
remaining abroad is one of major importance,
and it can be related to a practical and logical
reappraisal of NATO policy and strategy.
Throughout the meetings at Brussels the continuing commitment by Canada to NATO and
Europe was affirmed and emphasized in no
uncertain terms by Canadian representatives.
Following Senator McDonald's report, our
colleague, Senator O'Leary, expressed some
disappointment at the fact that when memOn motion of Hon. Mr. Macdonald, for Hon. bers of the Senate return from NATO conferMr. Sullivan, debate adjourned.
ences and make their report to this chamber
21498-13

SENATE DEBATES
they always stress one part, or one obligation,
of the NATO alliance, namely, the military
aspect. Senator O'Leary then referred briefly
to NATO's other obligations and commitments, and particularly to the clause in the
treaty dealing with the economic and social
importance of NATO countries. He must have
been reading my mind because my main
reason for moving the adjournment of the
debate was to report to this house, and so
inform honourable senators, not on the social
functions which normally take place on such
occasions but on those parts of the discussions
at Brussels dealing with NATO obligations or
objectives not directly connected with the
military aspect of the alliance.
It is my intention to refer particularly to
the proposal made by President Nixon to the
Council of Ministers in Washington last April,
in his address at NATO's twentieth anniversary commemorative session. The President of
the United States then urged the creation of a
committee on the challenges of modern society, to explore ways in which the experience
and resources of the Western nations could
most effectively be marshalled towards
improving the quality of life of our peoples,
and thus contribute to the economic and
social well-being of member countries. On
that occasion he said:
The Alliance of the West needs a third
dimension. It needs not only a strong
military dimension to provide for the
common defence; not only a more profound political dimension, to shape a
strategy of peace but it also needs a
social dimension to deal with the quality
of life in this final third of the Twentieth
Century.
Those words reflect a growing concern for
the need to bring man and his environment to
terms with each other, and, judging from the
discussions which took place in Brussels,
members of the alliance are becoming more
and more conscious that they share common
problems which, unless squarely faced, could
imperil the progress and welfare of their
societies.
It appears to me that when the North
Atlantic Treaty was signed on April 4, 1949,
an important step was taken towards the
integration of Europe and a partnership of
the Atlantic world. The alliance was to serve
not only the purposes of common military
defence, but also of co-operation in the political, social, economic, and cultural fields.
In the course of the years which have
elapsed, NATO's task, while it may have been
[Hon. Mr. Robichaud.]

November 20, 1969

changing, has grown. It offers to the allied
nations a challenge to carry out those reforms
in state, society, economy, and even politics,
which must be introduced and implemented if
we want to master our future. What is needed
today is a policy which permits change, and
can adapt itself to the situation of the day
and the problems of the future.
The Canadian parliamentary delegation did
not in fact limit itself to the military or
defence aspect of NATO. Prior to the Brussels
meeting the Canadian group visited Strasbourg and held important and most valuable
discussions with staff members and representatives of the Council of Europe. A full day's
briefing and deliberations with members of
this effective league, comprising 18 member
states and affecting the lives of 300 million
Europeans, made us fully aware of the noble
aims and objectives of this council. We
learned of their efforts to achieve a greater
unity between its members, thus resulting in
safeguarding and realizing the ideals and
principles which are their common heritage
and also facilitating their economic and social
progress.
Composed of a committee of ministers and
a consultative assembly served by a full-time
secretariat, this council has, since its formation some 30 years ago, concerned itself with
such problems as economic policies, legal cooperation, human rights, education, culture
and leisure, natural resources, social affairs,
health and hygiene-in other words, with all
matters dealing with human environment.
At the Brussels meeting the Canadian delegation also took active part and played an
important role in such committees as the
political committee, the economic committee,
the scientific and technical committee and the
committee on education, cultural affairs and
information. Not only were the Canadian
representatives active in the discussions
which took place during the committees' sittings, but the co-ordinators and others also
had their word at the plenary sessions
when the reports and resolutions of their
respective committees were presented or
introduced for adoption. At such meetings,
recommendations were made and resolutions
were adopted affecting such problems as
urging the governments of the other 14 members of the alliance to utilize all appropriate
means to bring about a prompt return by
Greece to free elections, parliamentary
democracy and the rule of law. They were
urged to concert their actions in this respect.
Among other resolutions adopted, one
resolved that the United States, in continuing

November 20, 1969

SENATE DEBATES

close consultation with its NATO and other
allies, should be urged to pursue efforts to
seek agreement with the Soviet Union, on a
basis consistent with enhancing western
security, on limitations to the strategic
nuclear arms race.
The continued absence of an official parliamentary assembly to discuss matters of
mutual concern to all member countries of
the Atlantic Alliance was noted with regret. A
resolution was passed urging members of the
assembly to initiate appropriate action in
their parliaments to bring about the recognition of the North Atlantic Assembly as the
parliamentary consultative body of the North
Atlantic Alliance.
The economic committee expressed its concern at the urgent need for increased economic aid to developing countries. It recommended that members of the alliance co-ordinate
and increase their economic assistance
through multilateral agencies such as the
World Bank and the special fund of the
United Nations. The committee, aware of the
problems created in world trade by the existence of numerous and complex non-tariff barriers, also made numerous recommendations
to the North Atlantic Council. It urged that
all members of the alliance redouble their
efforts to resist protectionist pressures. Furthermore, this committee also recommended
that the members of the alliance consider the
possibility of closer co-operation in national
efforts to combat inflationary tendencies.
It is not my intention at this time to bring
to the attention of honourable senators all the
recommendations and resolutions adopted by
the Fifteenth Annual Conference of the North
Atlantic Assembly. However, may I be permitted to refer briefly to one main problem
which seemed to attract considerable attention and create a general interest during the
discussions which took place before various
committees and also at the plenary sessions.
There seemed to be unanimous consent
among members that measures to combat the
problem of pollution have proven inadequate
and have failed.
The scientific and technical committee had
long discussions on what was considered to be
continued neglect of the urgent world problem of pollution affecting both inland waters
and the oceans. It was made evident that such
neglect could soon result in our reaching "the
point of no return". The assembly urgently
recommended to the North Atlantic Coundil
that each member give national support to a
co-operative plan to gain control of the situa21498-13J

tion. An initial step should be the establishment of a control centre to monitor the type
and degree of pollution of international inland
waterways.
A member of the Canadian delegation, Mr.
Ian Watson, M.P. for Laprairie, introduced a
resolution at this committee affecting research
on Arctic waters. Recognizing the fact that
the Arctic regions represent the world's last
unspoiled frontiers from the standpoint of
water pollution, and noting the plans now
under way for extensive oil operations and
transportation in the Arctic areas, a resolution was introduced and passed recommending:
(a) An operational research study to determine environmentally acceptable levels of oil
pollution occurrences in cold temperature
waters and pollution safeguards to be
required of oil tankers and pollutant-carrying
maritime traffic in Arctic and North Atlantic
waters.
(b) A research project into the effect of oil
and other chemical pollutants on the marine
biology and ecology of the cold temperature
waters of the Arctic and North Atlantic
Oceans.
(c) A supporting program aimed at developing improved methods of combating pollution
in cold temperature waters.
This resolution, as honourable senators
realize, is well in line with and conforms to
statements which have since been made by
the Right Honourable the Prime Minister, and
by the Minister of Transport, following the
return of the Manhattan from its Arctic expedition or its northwest passage.
Another resolution emanating from the
scientific and technical committee was that
introduced by Senator Pell of the U.S.A.
regarding the need for an ocean space treaty.
This recommendation urged the North Atlantic Coundil to endorse through the member
nations the urgent introduction of an ocean
space treaty, to institute a system of international control. In doing so, provision was
made for the definition of the continental
shelf; the setting up of a licence-granting
authority; the creation of an international
seaguard to insure the observance of the
principles of the treaty and, finally, the setting up of an adjudicating body to decide disputes.
The proposal made by Senator Pell involved new principles establishing fixed limits for defining the outer boundaries of the
continental shelf of coastal states. His suggestion that the term "continental shelf" be used

SENATE DEBATES
to refer to the seabed and subsoil of the
submarine areas adjacent to the coast but
outside the area of the territorial sea to a
depth of 550 meters, or to a distance of 50
miles from the base lines from which the
breadth of the territorial sea is measured,
whichever results in the greatest area of continental shelf, is one that must be approached
with the greatest care and caution, but also
one that deserves careful consideration by
Canadian experts in this field. I express the
hope that officials of the Department of
External Affairs will study these proposals,
and that opinions will be expressed making
known the Canadian Government's position
on Senator Pell's resolution.
Honourable senators, I have attempted to
place before you in a few words some of the
subjects, outside those of a military nature,
that have attracted the attention of parliaxnentary delegations at the Fifteenth Annual
Conference of the North Atlantic Assembly
held at Brussels from the 16th to the 21st
October. All honourable senators will agree
with me that, judging from the wide scope of
discussions that took place, one must come to
the conclusion that the NATO treaty is more
than a military alliance, that the alliance of
the West seems to be reflecting more and
more its concern for the quality of life in this
final third of the twentieth century, and for
the need to bring man and his environment to
terms with each other.
In conclusion, I also wish to thank the
Leader of the Government (Hon. Mr. Martin)
for the opportunity given me of making this
trip as a member of the Canadian parliamentary delegation. I also agree with the Deputy
Leader (Hon. Mr. McDonald) that if Canadian
representatives are to make their maximum
contributions to the discussions in the North
Atlantic Assembly there should be more continuity to its membership.
I want to compliment the officials of the
Department of External Affairs on their
excellent and most valuable briefing prior to
our visit in Europe, and also to express my
thanks and appreciation to Mr. Peter Dobell,
Director of the Parliamentary Centre for
Foreign Affairs and Foreign Trade, for his
excellent advice, which has contributed so
much to our better understanding of the
problems before us for deliberation.
I thank honourable senators for giving me
the opportunity to present this brief report.

November 20, 1969

NATO headquarters in Brussels, Belgium,
touring the Canadian NATO installations at
Lahr, Germany, and also spending some time
in Berlin as a member of the Canadian delegation. I wish to thank the Leader of the
Government (Hon. Mr. Martin) for giving me
the opportunity to make this most delightful
trip overseas, which was also a form of
education.
From what I have seen and heard on my
trip, I cannot help but use the lines that I had
intended closing my speech with, that in my
opinion the situation in Europe is just as
dangerous as it was in 1945, and that the
possibilities of outright hostilities exist as
much today as they did then. Yet the Department of National Defence, in a statement
made on September 19 by the Honourable
Leo Cadieux, Minister of National Defence,
presented a statement saying that the Canadian Government is intending to pull its forces
out of Europe, not completely but making a
very large reduction; to be precise, according
to the minister, a reduction of 16,000 military
and 5,000 civilian personnel. I feel from firsthand observations that the minister's findings
are not to the nation's best advantage, even
though I agree it will mean a considerable
saving to the taxpayers of Canada.
Leaving you with these remarks to ponder
for a few moments, I would like to briefiy
review what NATO is and what its functions
are. I do this simply because possibly some of
you are really not aware of when it was
formed and what its functions are, as I must
confess I, like many more, was not, even
though it has been a household word for the
past 20 years.
On April 4, 1949, twelve foreign ministers
from Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, Iceland,
Italy,
Luxembourg,
Netherlands,
Norway, Portugal, United Kingdom and the
United States, met in Washington and signed
a treaty on behalf of their individual nations,
their purpose being collectively to create the
biggest common defence system the world
had ever known in peacetime, and to link the
new world with the old in a mutual defence
pact.
The North Atlantic Treaty Organizationor shortly, NATO-is composed of permanent
representatives of each member country. It

DEBATES

SWhat is NATO? In a few words, it is an
intergovernmental body. Ail council decisions
are taken in camplete agreement by ail members concerned, and it has the ability to
change ail decisions to meet changing circumstances when they arise.
What are the aims of NATO? Its first priarity is ta meet the commitments under the
treaty, which is ta create a common defence
system capable of protecting ail territory
under its jurisdiction against possible attack.
At the end of the war ail the allied armies
were in a sad state as ta manpower and equipment, while the Russians were nearly at their
wartime level. The creation af a common
defence system was accomplished by setting
Up three commands: a European Commnand,
an Atlantic Command, and a Channel Command. I need flot burden you with an expianation af these three individual commands, as
the areas are fairly weil known and I do nat
wish ta bore you with toa many facts.
How was unity brought about? As would be
expected, ail countries did not think alile or
share the same views, and this showed a need
for a co-ordinated viewpoint and foreign
policy, and thus have a common approach ta
mutual interest for ail concerned.
With this i mind, a committee af three
was elected-Foreign Ministers Gaetana Martino af Italy, Halvard Lange af Narway, and
Lester Pearson of Canada. The view of the
three was put in few words: "There cannat be
unity in defence and disunity in ioreign
poicy."y
Finances were another problem facing the
alliance, for in the early days it was the lack
ai major installations, such as airfields, pipe
lines, harbaurs, et cetera, which were a necessity if the cammon defence system were ta be
made ta work. This was adopted by ail members cantributing ta the camman-user installations. Ta date, $3,600 million have been
used in this way.
As you know, France withdrew from NATO
in March 1966, and this withdrawal posed
a serious threat ta the arganizatian. But the
planning and the relacation af the forces
under such circumstances, and on such short
notice, is an example oi how the working ai
NATO is carried on. The wîthdrawal ai
France invoived more than 100,000 people
and the transfer oi aver one million tons ai
stores and equipment. Althaugh France does
participate in men and materials, it has
remained a member ai the alliance.
After this happened, Pierre Harmel, Belgium's Minister ai Foreign Affairs, drew up

what is known as the "Harmel Repart". The
basic aim af that repart was ta have the allies
foster a further mavement ai East-West relations that ini the end would resuit in same
agreement between the two factions. In short,
it was described as a ways and means ai
caming ta a mutual agreement between the
members ai the alliance and the Soviet Unian
for a reduction in overail troop strength by
bath parties.
No soaner had these attempts at a peaceful
and campiete agreement for bath parties concerned taken place than the Soviet Union on
August 20, 1968, with heip iram four other
Warsaw Pact nations, invaded Czechoslovakia
without warning. This was the bursting ai the
bubbie for any such agreement, and once
mare collective defence was on top ai the list
af priorities with NATO.
Now, one might ask if the invasion of Czechosiavakia caught NATO napping? In this
case there were three particular types ai
warnings: political, strategical, and technical.
NATO knew what was happening and what
was going ta happen, but they did not dare ta
intervene in the invasion simply because
Czechoslavakia was not in the NATO area,
nor was it a member ai the arganization. Any'
action by any NATO country cauld have triggered World War III. Moreover, the Czechosiovakian gavernment had requested no
assistance from any country.
One may naw ask the question: Has the
Soviet threat changed over the years; can it
now be said that we can safely withdraw
troaps from NATO without fear ai reprisai?
The Czechoslovakian incident *has shawn
that the Saviets are still wifling ta use farce
ta show autharity, and that the Saviet gavernment is prepared and willing ta sacrifice
its image ta further its aims and ta keep
Warsaw Pact members in Uine at ail costs. It
can aiso prove that it is flot in the interests ai
peace and security that NATO be disbanded.
If NATO is further reduced it may increase
the threat ai aggression in certain sensitive
areas such as West Berlin, the Federal
Republic af Germany, and Rumania and
Yugoslavia, twa cauntries where it is suspected the Soviets would like ta put more teeth
inta the cammunist or socialist governments
ta bring them dloser ta the Saviet way ai
thinking. If NATO were ta lessen its troops or
activities, I arn airaid the heel ai cammunism
would quickiy spread over Europe.
To give yau an idea ai the strength ai the
Soviet Union, I would. point ta the growth af
the Soviet navy. Within the past two decades

power in the world, next to the United States.
Its fleet of 360 submarines, many of which are
nuclear powered and nuclear armed, is the
largest in the world. They are building
approximately ten new submarines a year.
Nine hundred marine design engineers and
naval architects graduate each year in Russia,
more than any other country in the world.
Their oceanographic research fleet is larger
than all other fleets put together. They have
the finest fishing fleet in the world, which can
easily be made over to carriers.
Other figures of Soviet strength includeand all these figures are approximate-15
cruisers, 100 destroyers, 100 escorts, 360 submarines, well over 1,000 fast patrol boats,
mine sweepers and amphibious type vessels,
and one helicopter-carrier which carries up
to 30 helicopters.
Soviet naval aviation-60 light bombers, 350
medium bombers, 150 reconnaissance aircraft,
210 anti-submarine aircraft, 90 transport
planes, and some 70 helicopters.
The Soviet Union's oceanographic research
fleet, numbering about 200 ships, is larger
than those of the rest of the world put together. The Soviet Intelligence fleet has some 36
surveillance ships.
During our trip we saw many things and
visited many places. We were entertained by
the King of Belgium, and we visited the
Canadian NATO base at Lahar. But what
stands out most vividly of all was our visit to
Berlin.
I had not seen Berlin after the war, but
from all reports it had been reduced to
rubble. However, with spartan effort the Berliners and West Germans have been rebuilding their city despite interference by the
Soviets such as the Berlin blockade when
everything had to be flown in. This blockade
was later discontinued, allowing free access to
the city.
At the end of the war, one-third of Berlin,
an area of 340 square miles, was totally
destroyed. Once a city of six million people,
East Berlin now has 2.2 million and West
Berlin 2.2 million, with 20 per cent of the
population being over 65 years of age.
An intensive building and restoration plan
has been going on in West Germany and in
Berlin. Many of the bombed buildings have
been reconstructed with the same stones and
appear as they did years ago.
An extensive building program is under
way in West Berlin, with 17,000 to 18,000
housing units being built each year. These are
two-, three-, and four-room low-rental units
[Hon. Mr. Welch.]

November 20, 1969

which are being made available to elderly
people.
I was told there is no unemployment. The
labour groups are very responsible people,
and in most cases keep the wages of tradesmen at a reasonably low rate. They import
tradesmen from France, Italy and other
nations.
As I mentioned, one-third of the city was
destroyed. Two-thirds of that area has been
restored, about 90 per cent of the money
coming from public financing and 10 per cent
from private capital. Interest rates are also
unbelievable, running from one-half to one
per cent. To give you a further idea of the
building boom and surplus money, the city is
now building a 1,300-bed hospital at the cost
of $80 million.
The Atlantic Alliance comprises 15 nations
with a total army, navy and air force complement of 5,366,356 men. These are not all stationed in Europe, of course. The alliance has
a total gross national product of 25,885 per
capita in United States dollars, with a combined population of 519,940,000 people. The
defence expenditures as a percentage of the
gross national product per country can be
broken down as follows: The United States,
Germany, the United Kingdom, Italy, France,
Turkey, Canada, The Netherlands, Belgium,
Portugal, Greece, Denmark, Norway and Luxembourg. Only Belgium, Denmark and Luxembourg contribute less of their gross national product than we do in Canada. All these
countries have a smaller population than we
have, mostly less than half.
Our delegation visited the Canadian base at
Lahr, as I said previously, where we were
briefed on the activities of our forces. Those
forces will be greatly reduced by July 1970
and, according to reports, there will be a
reduction in our aircraft from 108 to 36. We
now have four bases, but after cutbacks we
will have only two bases, and land forces will
be reduced from 5,300 to 2,800, and civilian
employees will be reduced by 900.
I could dwell on the cutbacks in general,
such as the abolition of the Black Watch regiments and other units, which to me is the
whittling away of Canada's historic traditions
and of those things which have any resemblance to our British heritage. But this is
straying from the subject at hand.
Honourable senators, before people decide
to cut down on our NATO forces they should
visit Berlin and see a once great city divided
by a high wall, with guards ready to shoot to
kill any person who tries to cross it without

permission. Shouid the guards miss, vicious
dogs are turned loose ta attack their victixn.
Either way there is no second chance. This is
an expensive price ta pay for freedom.
Along the 11wall" route and at "Check Point
Charlie," which is what the gateway is called,
monuments have been erected in memory of
those who have tried to cross the border ta
freedom, only ta be shot in the back by
guards. Russia is reported ta have 140,000
troops stationed on the east side of the wall.
These troops are well-equipped and ready for
action at a moment's notice. Having gone ta
Berlin and seen these conditions I arn glad we
have such a force as NATO ta protect us.
The Govertnent daes not have ta reduce
aur NATO strength in order ta save money. If
it really wishes ta save money, let it rearrange the whoie system of sending aur
traops. It would be cheaper for us ta send aur
men for a period of one year without their
familles. After ail, Canadian troops during
wartime were not accompanied by their
familles.
In closing, 1 return ta my opening remarks.
From what I have seen, I beieve the situation
in Europe is just as dangerous today, and that
the possibilities of outright hostflities exist as
much today as in 1945.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Macdonald, for Hon.
Mr. Grosart, debate adjourned.
OIL AND GAS PRODUCTION AND
CONSERVATION ACT
BILL TO AMEND-SECOND READINGDEBATE ADJOURNED

Hon. Harry Hays moved the second reading
of Bill S-5, ta amend the Ou1 and Gas Production and Conservation Act.
He said: Honourable senators, responsibflity
for this bull wiil rest with the Minister of
Energy, Mines and Resources. The bull had its
first reading in the Senate on October 23.
In its present form, the Oil and Gas Production and Conservation Act, which received
Rayai Assent on June 27, 1969, provides
statutory authority for the contrai of ail and
gas operations on Canada lands in the Yukon
and Northwest Territories.
The new bill is designed ta amend the 011
and Oas Production and Conservation Act so
that it wiil apply ta Canada lands offshore
fromn Canada's sea coasts as well as ta thase
ini the Territories. The significant amendment
is with respect ta section 3, the area of
application of the act. Other ameadments are
simply for the purpose of giving effect ta the

respective minerai resouroe administration
responsibilities of the Departmnent of Indian
Affairs and Northern Deveiopment, and the
Department of Energy, Mines and Resources.
As to the reason for Bill S-5, it is necessary ta establish comprehensive iegislative
authority governing offshore ail and gas aperations, ta cape with the increasing tempo of
offshore exploration activities, in particular
ail and gas drilling and production operations.
This is emphasized by such incidents as the
recent Santa Barbara Channel disaster. The
Oul and Gas Production and Conservation
Act, when amended, will provide comprehensive statutory authority for contrai of ail and
gas operations, prevention of waste, and
safety of operations in offshore areas.
la brief, the amended act wiil provide, as
follows, for Canada lands bath la the Territories and in offshore areas:
(a) Authority for the Governor in Council
ta make regulations for the contrai and
administration of ail physicai operations
associated with the development, production, storing, and other handling of ail
and gas, including such matters as safety
and pollution.
(b) Requirements for the conservation of
ail and gas and prohibition of waste.
(c) Authority ta require pooling and unitization under certain circuinstances. Wide
spacing of weUls consistent with good
engineering practice and early unitization
of fields wili be a key ta assuring that
production costs are kept ta a minimum
so as ta heip make the ail and gas produced competitive la worid markets.
(d) Authority for ministers and designated officers of the crown to carry into
effect the requirements of the act by the
issuance of directives and orders ia prescribed circumstances.
(e) Establishment of an ail and gas
committee ta advise ministers and hear
appeals fromn orders and directives.
The 011 and Oas Production and Conservation Act is the product of severai
years of study and discussion by officiais of
the Department of Indian Aiffairs and Northern Development, and the Departmnent of
Energy, Mines and Resources, including discussions at variaus stages with the Canadian
Petroieum Association and the National
Energy Board. When the draft act was first
prepared, the then Departmnent of Northern
Affairs and National Resources was responsible for administering the minerai resouroes of

SENATE DEBATES
all Canada lands, and the original intent was
for the act to apply to the Canada lands of
both the Territories and the offshore. Early in
1966, responsibility for administering the
mineral resources of certain areas, including
the Canada lands off the east and west coasts
and in the Hudson Bay-Hudson Strait
region, was transferred from the then Department of Northern Affairs and National
Resources to the then Department of Mines
and Technical Surveys, the present Department of Energy, Mines and Resources.
In the following year it was decided that
because of the necessity of ensuring orderly
development of the oil and gas resources of
the Yukon and Northwest Territories, particularly with respect to the recently discovered Pointed Mountain gas pool, the draft Oil
and Gas Production and Conservation Act
should be enacted as soon as possible. At that
time the offshore mineral rights situation was
at a particularly sensitive stage, the west
coast reference being still under consideration by the Supreme Court, and there was no
federal-provincial accommodation in sight.
The draft act was therefore revised just
enough to make it applicable only to those
Canada lands in the Yukon and Northwest
Territories.
It was envisaged that at an appropriate
time, possibly before coming to Parliament,
the proposed act would be amended as to
apply to all Canada lands, those in the offshore as well as those in the Territories. This
would eliminate the necessity of eventually
having two federal acts governing oil and gas
matters in respect of Canada lands, one for
the Territories and one for the offshore.
The offshore situation has changed markedly since the decision was made to proceed
with the draft Oil and Gas Production and
Conservation Act in a form that would make
it applicable only to the Yukon and Northwest Territories.
On November 7, 1967, the Supreme Court
of Canada handed down its advisory opinion
on the west coast reference, which was unanimous in finding entirely in favour of Canada
with respect to the resources of the submerged lands lying offshore from the "ordinary low water mark" and outside "harbours,
bays, estuaries and other similar inland
waters". Since the principles forming the
basis of this opinion appear to be substantially applicable to the east coast as well as to
the west coast, the main problem became one
of delimiting the areas of federal and provincial jurisdiction.
[Hon. Mr. Hays.]

November 20, 1969

On November 29, 1968, the Prime Minister
sent a letter to the provincial premiers outlining the federal position concerning offshore
mineral rights, and followed this up on
December 2 with a comprehensive announcement in the House of Commons. In brief, the
announcement involved the establishment of
mineral resource administration lines to
divide areas of federal and provincial
administration, with the federal Government
continuing to
administer
the
mineral
resources on the seaward side of these lines.
Administration of the mineral resources
between the lines and the shore was offered
to the coastal provinces, which would receive
all revenues accruing therefrom. Furthermore, the provinces were offered half the
revenues accruing from mineral resource
exploitation within the federally administered
areas off the east and west coasts and in the
Hudson Bay region, with these revenues
being placed in a single pool to be distributed
among the provinces on a basis acceptable to
them.
The Prime Minister sent a further letter on
February 27, 1969, to the provincial premiers
concerning the establishment of mineral
resource administration lines in the Hudson
Bay-Hudson Strait region, as well as a line
marking the northern limit of the national
pool area, that is, a boundary between submerged lands adjacent to the provinces and
those adjacent to the Northwest Territories
and the Arctic Islands. This was followed up
by an announcement to the same effect on
March 4 in the House of Commons.
The Prime Minister's announcements on
offshore mineral rights served as a stimulus
to offshore exploration in the regions
involved, off the east and west coasts and in
the Hudson Bay-Hudson Strait region. This is
reflected in the marked increase in applications for exploratory permits as well as in the
number of new exploration programs. In
total, approximately 550 million acres are
presently held under offshore Canada Oil and
Gas Permits. They are made up as follows:
east coast, 262 million acres; Hudson BayHudson Strait, 126 million acres; west coast,
16 million acres; and Arctic, approximately
145 million acres.
It may be of interest to note here for purposes of comparison that the total area of
Canada's submerged continental margin,
including the east coast region, the west coast
region, the Hudson Bay-Hudson Strait region,
and the Arctic region, is in the order of 1.5
million square miles, which is almost 40 per
cent as large as the total land area of Canada.

November 20, 1969

Noveber20. 969SENATE
DEBATES

Offshore Canada Oil and Gas permits now
cover more than hall of this area, approximately 860,000 square miles.
The upsurge of exploration activity is especiaily pronounced in the east coast region.
Permidts issued off the east coast alone now
cover an area-409,000 square miles-about
twice as large as that of the four Atlantic
Provinces combined including Labrador,
stretching in an unbroken beit for some 2,000
miles fromn the Gulf of Maine northeasterly to
the Grand Banks and thence northerly to
Hudson Strait.
Geophysical surveys have been conducted
throughout this region up to 300 miles off our
coasts and commonly in areas with water
depths of several hundreds of feet and, in
places, several thousands of feet. In September an extensive driiling programn commenced
off the east coast on the Scotian Sheif, and
there will be additional extensive driiling
prograins in east coast areas over the next
year. Two semi-submersible drilling units are
being built in Halifax at a cost of about $12
million each for two of these future programs. Each of these units wiil have a drilling
capability of 25,000 f eet, and the ability to
operate in 800 feet or more of water. On the
basis of announced drilling programs and
tentative programs as yet ini varlous stages
of planning, it seems no exaggeration to estimate that some 50 exploratory wefls will
probably be drilled off the east coast over the
next thice years or so.
Drilling developments in our offshore areas
have already outstripped the expectations of

21498-14

only a few years ago. The rapidly increasing
tempo of off shore exploration activities
demonstrates the importance of establishing
comprehensive legislative authority governing
offshore oil and gas operations. This need is
,further pointed up by incidents in offshore
areas elsewhere i the world such as the
recent Santa Barbara Channel disaster. Offshore oil and gas operations must be carried
out in a manner that provides maximum protection against a disaster of this type in the
vulnerable multi-resource ocean environment.
Honourable senators, 1 commend this bill to
you. I would suggest that it should go to the
Standing Senate Committee on Banking and
Commerce. There are many questions which I
probably wiil not be able to answer, and, in
fact, I am also interested in asking a few
questions myself.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Is the sponsor of the
bill able to tell me whether the provinces
affected have accepted the proposal of the
Prime Minister, or do some of themn stiu.

rights in question?
Hon. Mr. Hays: I am not competent to

Government suggests, but, as I have said, I
am not competent to answer the question.

POVERTY
PRESS CONFERENCE-AUTHORITY TO SPEAK
ON BEHALF OF SENATE COMMITTEEQUESTION ANSWERED-PRIVILEGE

Hon. David A. Croll: Honourable senators,
may I rise on a question of privilege to refer
briefly to a question asked in the Senate on
November 20, concerning the Poverty Committee, and reported at page 184 of the
Hansard of that day?
First, let me say that no one speaks for the
Senate but the Senate. No one spoke for the
Senate Committee on Poverty. There was an
informal press briefing conducted by an official of the committee, as is the common practice when the committee moves into a new
area. That practice consists of giving to the
news media the committee's terms of reference, a summary of its activities and some
information on the members of the committee,
usually taken from the Canadian Parliamentary Guide.
What was done in Vancouver was in keeping with the practice followed in other cities
where the director was authorized to conduct
the usual press briefing. In the course thereof
words something like those quoted in the
Senate Hansardof November 20 were used at
some stage of the discussion but, as honourable senators are aware, when words are taken
out of context and overdramatized the wrong
impression or a unique emphasis may be conveyed. Needless to say, nothing in any way
inflammatory was intended. The director was
simply attempting to bring home the urgency
of the problem of poverty, and in so doing he
used his own words and was expressing a
personal opinion.
It is, in my view, most important that the
committee elicit a response from the country.
So far, we have received a wide and varied
response. In so far as the committee is concerned, the director has its complete confidence. In the course of the remarks made in
the Senate there was reference to sedition.
That reference was most unfitting and unfortunate, particularly as it applied to one who
is a graduate of the Royal Military College, a

November 25, 1969

former member of the Canadian Armed
Forces and of the Defence Research Board.
Section 61 of the Criminal Code, dealing
with sedition, reads as follows:
... person shall be deemed to have a
no
seditious intention by reason only that lie
intends, in good faith, ...
(d) to point out, for the purpose of
removal, matters that produce or tend
to produce feelings of hostility and illwill between different classes of persons in Canada.
The whole purpose of the committee is
dedicated to the alleviation of the problems of
the poor, and nothing else.
NUCLEAR NON-PROLIFERATION TREATY
RATIFICATION BY U.S.A. AND U.S.S.R.

Hon. Paul Martin: Honourable senators,
yesterday in the other place the Prime Minister noted the importance of the event
announced on that day by the United States
and the Soviet Union, namely, the intention
of these two governments to deposit instruments of ratification of the Non-Proliferation
Treaty in regard to nuclear weapons.
Several months ago Canada ratified this
treaty, which was tabled in this house and
discussed at the time the instrument of ratification by Canada was deposited.
The declaration by the two major powers is
a matter of the greatest importance. This
treaty will take its place with the Partial Test
Ban Treaty on nuclear weapons, the commitment made at the United Nations by members
of that body to outlaw nuclear weapons in
outer space. It marks a very important step.
For some time Canada has been urging the
signing and ratification of the treaty by all
powers, including these two powers who have
now indicated their intention to ratify. We
hope that this event will precede the coming
into force of the treaty which Canada and
some twenty other countries have now
ratified.
Hon. Jacques Flynn: Honourable senators,
needless to say, we on this side of the chamber share the satisfaction of the honourable
Leader of the Government in the fact that the
two great nuclear powers, the U.S.A. and the
U.S.S.R., have decided to ratify the nonproliferation treaty in respect of nuclear
weapons. The whole world is rejoicing with
us at this very significant step towards eventually ridding the world of the threat of
destruction by nuclear arms.

On the same day he added:
Canadians as a whole have a great stake
in national prestige to assure the success
of this project. No one yet knows what
the total expenditure will be
Finally, he said:
There has been an estimate of $585 million as the total cost-an
estimate I think made by the commissioner.
I have given these quotations to try to provide immediately an answer to the objection
that bas been made, and will probably be
made again, of mounting costs from the time
of the creation of the Corporation to the end
of 1967. I wanted to show also that no one
knew at the very beginning what the costs
would be. I understand that Expo Osaka next
year will cost approximately $2,300 million.
So, the expenditures of Expo 1967, including
the expenditures of federal, provincial and
municipal governments, private firms and
foreign governments represent a total less
than half that of Expo Osaka-in other
words, $1,100 million.
In passing, I would remind honourable
senators that according to the figures given to
me the Corporation built 847 buildings, 27
bridges and 51 miles of road. It then becomes
clear why the Corporation itself spent more
than $400 million, and why, in effect, $125
million may now have to be written off the
accounts of the Corporation and be absorbed
by the Government of Canada. As stated by
the Director of the Canadian Corporation,
Dr. A. G. Irvine
The Government of Canada had on its
balance sheet the notes of the Expo Corporation which have been replaced by
notes issued by Quebec and Montreal.
There is a balance remaining which is a
claim as a guarantor on the Expo Corporation and it is that asset which has to be
removed from the balance sheet and will,
in fact, be extinguished by this
appropriation.

made by the Canadian government, totalling
$200 million. In exchange for the loans, notes
were issued by the Corporation, guaranteed
jointly by the Government of Canada and the
Province of Quebec, and further loans were
so granted which were made by the banks to
the extent of $35 million.
The Canadian World Exhibition Corporation Act provided for the distribution of
assets among the three governments,
... in such manner and subject to such

conditions as the Governor-in-Council,
with the concurrence of the Lieutenant
Governor in Council, may prescribe.

By virtue of the other order in council
referred to, the Government of Canada
received on January 1, 1968 all assets
on the land known as Cité du Havre, and
the City of Montreal acquired ail the assets
situated on l'Île Notre-Dame and l'île SteHélène. I do not think it is necessary for me
to enumerate in detail the structures and
installations comprised in the distribution of
assets. Certain other assets remaining, such as
the art gallery and the Expo theatre, were
attributed to the Province of Quebec.
Honourable senators, I do not intend spending much time on this introduction, as the
committee which studies the bill will be able
to obtain from the expert witnesses who
appear before it ail the facts and all the
details required for their complete information. However, there are a few highlights I
would like to mention briefly, as they may
contribute to the orientation and the thinking
of honourable senators in the committee.
The first point which I have tried to anticipate earlier is the cost of Expo and its escalation. Perhaps in this line of thought we
should start by killing the myth that Expo
was going to cost Ottawa $20 million and that
this was the end of it. I tried earlier to show
the absurdity of this proposition, which only
one who was very naïve could have so construed. The earlier plan for Expo was not
created-it grew, and grew and grew. It is
evident that the first master plans were but a

Montreai it produced tremendous benefits. We
got roads and bridges; we got a tunnel under
the St. Lawrence River for the Metro; we got
a very elaborate ice control system at the top
of the St. Mary's Current. Wben one realizes
that Expo was built mostly on a man-made
island, it is not surprising that the builders
ran into many difficulties.
As far back as 1963, the Auditor General
expressed concern that the operating budget
certainly wouid exceed the amounts which
had been allowed. In 1964 hie drew attention
to the obvious fact that the extent of the
spending would exceed the grants. In 1965 hè
warned that certain aspects of the Corporation's financial control required improve-ý
ments. He also said that the banking arrangements were not in order. As Senator Gélinas
has just pointed out, when one considers that
the federal Government's share was to be in
the order of $40 million and it ended up at
$285 million, one can appreciate that there
was a certain amount of miscalculation ail the
way through. However, honourable senators,
in my view it was worth every penny of it.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: I strongly recommend
the passage of this bil.
Hon. John J. Connolly: Honourable senators, I did flot intend to speak to this bill, and
it is difficuit to do so after the excellent
presentation which has been made by my colleagues from Montreal. I do not wish to talk
about money; Senator Gélinas and Senator
Beaubien have deait with that aspect of it. I
do not wish to talk about buildings or roads,
or the man-made islands, the crowds or the
value to Montreal. I wish only to talk for a
moment about the reason why this great project became the tremendous international success that it was.
Honourable senators, the credit in the first
place is due to that very dynamie man, the
Mayor of Montreal, son honneur le maire Jean
Drapeau.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): I give
hinm full credit, as ail Canada should.
From what I remember of the original
Hon. L. P. Beaubien: Honourable senators, debate when this Corporation was set up, the

concept of the importance of Canada's centennial year.
I do not wish to forget that one of his
ministers, Mr. Sevigny, went to the World's
Fair Organization in Paris and succeeded in
convincing them that the World's Fair for
1967 should come to Canada.
I single out three men in this instance who
were in at the beginning. It is probably unfair
to single out three, but they were important
people in this exercise.
Honourable senators, too much credit
cannot be given to Mr. Shaw, who really
drove this project to the point where the fair
could open on time, and to Mr. Kniewasser,
and to the Honourable Lionel Chevrier, who
did so much during the centennial year, and
to the two ministers who were concerned in
the Government which succeeded Mr. Diefenbaker's, namely, the Honourable Mitchell
Sharp and the late Robert Winters, both Ministers of Trade and Commerce at their respective times.
We shall not forget the tremendous contribution made by the young people who
worked as hostesses and as guides in almost
every facet and aspect of that great
institution.
The man I wish to single out above all
others is the late Pierre Dupuy. He is a man
we should never forget, for Expo 67 is his
monument. I understand that it was he who
conceived this new idea in world fairs. The
old song, "Meet Me in St. Louis, Meet Me at
the Fair," was something of the nineteenth
century. Then world fairs became almost
trade fairs. Pierre Dupuy had the concept
that our world fair should be elevating and
inspiring, not only to Canadians but to everybody who visited it. He conceived the idea of
the world that man occupies being portrayed
in the various national exhibits that were
produced there.
Some of those exhibits were superb; all of
them were excellent. They depicted not only
the cultural, social and economic conditions of
life throughout the world, even behind the
Iron Curtain, but even projected into the
future in an effort to get people to think of
what lay ahead for mankind.
This has been a tremendous contribution to
international goodwill and understanding.
Perhaps some of it contributed to the signing
of the non-proliferation treaty for nuclear
weapons alluded to earlier this evening by
the Leader of the Government and the
Leader of the Opposition.
[Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West).]

November 25, 1969

Canada has derived great prestige from this
fair. Even yet, when one visits foreign countries, people ask what has happened concerning Expo.
Expo was a thing in itself. It was a thing
apart. It was Canadian. And yet it depicted
the world village. For my part, I feel that a
contribution to the man who had the concept
of a fair which would tell man what he did
not know about his world is a great monument to the memory of a great Canadian.

OIL AND GAS PRODUCTION AND
CONSERVATION ACT
BILL TO AMEND-SECOND

READING

The Senate resumed from Thursday,
November 20, the adjourned debate on the
motion of Hon. Mr. Hays for second reading
of Bill S-5, to amend the Oil and Gas Production and Conservation Act.
Hon. John M. Macdonald: Honourable senators, the main feature of this bill is contained
in clause 3 which makes it very clear that
offshore installations are included in the definition of "pipeline", and so brings such installations under the provisions of the act.
Now, honourable senators, you are all
aware that there has been a long-standing
disagreement between the federal and provincial governments as to the ownership of offshore minerals-of the minerals which may
be present in the lands under the ocean floor.
As the sponsor of the bill mentioned, there
is a reference to the Supreme Court of
Canada as to the ownership of such lands on
the west coast, and late in November 1967
that court handed down an advisory opinion
on the west coast reference, finding in favour
of the federal authority with respect to the
resources of the submerged lands lying offshore from the "ordinary low water mark and
outside harbours, bays, estuaries and other
similar inland waters."
Apparently the federal Government has
assumed that this decision, or the reasoning
behind it, is also applicable to the submerged
lands on the east coast and under the coastal
waters of the provinces; and it must be on

November 25, 1969

DEBATES

this assumption that these amendments are
now proposed.
Honourable senators, 1 do flot know if the
provinces affected by this bil, apart; from
British Columubia, have conceded to the federai authority the ownership of these submerged lands. If they have, then the sponsor
is correct in stating that the main problem is
now one of delimiting the areas of federal
and provincial jurisdiction. In any event, I do
think that we should be informed if the ownership of these lands has now been settled.
Have the provinces affected, such as the
Atlantic provinces and Quebec, for example,
given Up their dlaims and agreed that ownership rests in the federal authority?
Han. Mr. Flynn: I doubt that very much.

In any event, the Prime Minister spoke of
the grid limes the federal Government
proposed to make to establish the offshore
boundaries. He mentioned also the willingness
of the federal Government to have negotiations with the provinces affected, in keeping with the proposai or commitment of
former Prime Minister, Lester B. Pearson.
However, froxu my reading of that statement
the area in which the federal Goverment
was prepared to negotiate was a very small
one. In fact it appeared to me that they were
telling the provinces "«we will allow you onehall of the revenues we may receive from the
offshore minerais and you can negotiate
among yourselves as to how that amount will
be divided among you."1
Honourable senators, the sponsor mentioned also that alter second reading he
proposes to send this bull to committee. I
think this is a very wise thing to do, so that
answers may be given to the questions which
are now in the minds of ail of us. I do not
think that the committee should meet tomorrow on this bull unless it feels certain that ahl
parties who may be interested, especially the
provinces, have had plenty of time to study
the implications of the bull and do not desire
to make representations before the committee.
I think it would be a pity if the image of the
Senate should suifer in this regard. As honourable senators are aware the reputation of the
Senate and of its comrnittees is that they are
always prepared to hear anyone who wishes
to be heard by themn.
Honourable senators, I thank you for your
attention.
Motion agreed to and bil read second lime.

Hon. Mr. Macdonald: The sponsor mentioned that the Prime Minister wrote to the
provinces on November 29, 1968 and on February 27, 1969, in reference to the matter, but
he did not give us any information as to what
replies were made to these letters. The
matter, of course, is urgent now on account of
ail the drilling for oul which is going on along
the east coast. Now, if my memory is correct,
the oul companies used to get drilling permits
fromn both the federal and provincial goverfiments, although I do not know if they have
been doing so since the 1967 decision of the
Supreme Court of Canada. I did see a reference to petroleuma licences in the 1968 report
of the Department of Mines of Nova Scotia. It

YUKON PLACER MINING ACT
BILL TO AMEND-SECOND

READING

The Senate resumed from Wednesday,
November 19, the debate on the motion of
Hon. Mr. Benidickson, for the second reading
of Bill S-4, to amend the Yukon Placer Mining Act.
Hon. John M. Macdonald: Honourable senators, this item on the order paper stands in
the name of Senator Haig, and as he cannot
be here this evening he asked me to substitute for him. With the permission of the
chamber, I would now like to do so.
The Hon. the Speaker: Is it agreed honourable senators?
Hon. Senators: Agreed.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Honourable senators,
as I mentioned, Senator Haig is unable to be
here this evening and rather than delay the
consideration of the bill he asked me to substitute for him. He gave me some material he
had gathered to prepare a speech, but in fairness to him I should tell you he had not
compiled any notes for his speech, so my few
remarks cannot be attributed to him. Indeed, I
expect his remarks would be much different
from mine, and little better or worse.
Hon. Mr. Martin: He could hardly have
selected a better substitute.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Honourable senators,
we are fortunate in having a former Minister
[Hon. Mr. Flynn.]

November 25, 1969

of Mines sponsor this bill. He has a knowledge of the subject which enabled him to give
a very clear and yet concise explanation of
the effects of the proposed amendments. Personally, I should like to have heard him speak
on this type of mining, especially its history
in the Yukon and the methods employed, as
I must confess I had little if any knowledge of
this type of mining.
My interest being aroused, as it were, I
looked up the definition of placer mining in
the Encyclopedia Britannica.It states that this
is a surface mining method applied to deposits of minerals accumulated into working
quantities of economic importance through
the natural geologic processes of weathering,
erosion and disposition. An alluvial placer
occurrence is one formed by the mechanical
action of moving water, whether of streams
or lakes or along a seacoast. Eluvial is a term
applied to placers formed mainly by weathering and thus it is found close to the parent
rock. Erosion of the parent rock bas set free
the heavy metallic components and these
have worked down the slope because of the
combined action of gravity and washing by
rains. Once a fiowing stream is reached, the
metal may be carried a long distance before it
is deposited. A placer deposit may be formed
by concentrations of gold or tin or by a
number of other minerals, but mining for
gold is generally the most common.
So honourable senators it was this type of
mining carried on by crude methods by which
$100 million worth of gold was obtained from
the placers of Yukon creeks between 1897 and
1904, inclusive.
The sponsor mentioned that in 1901 and
again in 1902 about one and one half million
ounces were recovered, while in 1968 the production has amounted to only about 10,000
ounces. At today's prices even 10,000 ounces
would bring well over $37 million, so if we
had this 1901 production today the value
would be fantastic. Of course today we have
assistance to gold mining by the provisions of
the Emergency Gold Mining Assistance Act. It
is interesting to note that this act applied to
placer mining, and that advantage was taken
of its provisions, though the amounts involved
were never very large.
In 1948, according to the statistics contained
in the report on the administration of the
Emergency Gold Mining Assistance Act, 117
companies received assistance, and of these,
20 were located in the Yukon, so I expect

more than $155,000. Apparently, that compa-

ny was the largest operating in the Yukon, so
one would expect it received the largest
amount of assistance, but 1965 seems to be
the last year that name appeared in the
report.
Honourable senators, I would be interested
in learning if the source of this gold in the
Yukon was ever discovered so that perhaps
an ordinary mine could be sunk and gold
obtained that way. One would expect, since
such a large amount of the material was
faund, that there must have been a large
deposit of the mineral somewhere, yet I do
not know if it was ever discovered.
Honourable senators, it is not my intention
to examine in detail the amendments
proposed by clauses 1, 2 and 3 of this bill.
The sponsor explained the effects of the new
section 17, the repeal of section 19 of the act
and of the additional section 93 of the act.
Since he feels these are good and necessary, I
am quite prepared to accept his assurance
that this legislation is not harmful to the
industry in the Yukon and that it is of benefit
to the general area. I think we would all be
prepared to accept that assurance.
The sponsor did not give any particular
reason why the amendments are being made
at this time, and perhaps there is no particular reason. It may very well be that, with the
increased interest now being taken in the
Yukon, all legislation regarding it is being
examined with a view to possible amendments. If there is some particular reason, perhaps this could be made known when the bill
is referred to committee.
The sponsor mentioned that he intends to
send this bill to committee. I think that is a
good idea. However, he also mentioned the
committee could deal with it this week.
Before dealing with it, I hope the committee
will satisfy itself that these proposed amendments have been brought to the attention of

Hon. Mr. Benidickson: I appreciate the
remarks of the honourable Senator Macdonald. I have discussed this bill with Senator
Haig, and I can assure Senator Macdonald
that there is good reason for not proceeding
this week with the consideration of this bill
in the Standing Senate Committee on Banking, Trade and Commerce, and that we will
accommodate the views of honourable senators opposite.
In general, I greatly appreciated what Senator Macdonald has said. Obviously he has an
excellent grasp of the placer mining situation
in the Yukon.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: A very recent one,
may I say.
Hon. Mr. Benidickson: In any event, he
was erudite and I thank him for his comments. As the Opposition Whip, I think he
knows the way in which to approach this
side concerning the timing of making
representations on this bill.

A definition of enviromental quality is flot
easy to reach, for quality of a given state of
aiffairs is a subjective and personal judgment.
We can more easily define what we do flot
want. We deplore urban slums or mass housing developments that reflect the consequences of past or present technology, but
ignore the beauty and utility of living things
in open green spaces. Countrysides ravaged
by unplanned development often become vast
public garbage dumps of rusting cars, derelict
buildings and eroded land. This is both
and aesthetlcally
economicafly wasteful
unacceptable.
We do not want waters so polluted that we
cannot swim or fish in them, or just enjoy
being near or on them. We do flot want our
air s0 foul that we have to rush indoors to an
air-conditioned, flltered environment in order
to breathe freely. We do not want noise to
intrude in oui working and living places to
the point where its presence is destructive of
oui work or pleasure, or, indeed, oui health.
We do flot want to live in surroundings that
are so completely man-made that we are no
longer conscious of the natural world around
us, or, if wanting to enjoy it, are unable to do
so because it is gone.
To put it positively, there is a consensus
among Canadians that economic progress
alone cannot provide a satisfying or healthful
life; that space, natural beauty, dlean air and
water, and quietness are essential elements
that add immeasurably to the quality of oui
standard of living. I believe the realization of
those qualities has urgent priority in oui
national goals.
1A brief historical review of the development of this country reveals fundamental
changes in attitudes toward oui natural
resouices. Since the times of the flrst white
settlement, Canada has been preoccupied with
the task of building a great nation. To the
earliest Europeans, oui renewable natuial
resouices must have seemed unlimlted. Those
resources played an essential role ln the development of oui country. The first detailed
explorations of oui coasts were done by
mariners exploring marine resources-fish off
the Atlantic coast, whales in the Arctic, and
sea otters on the Pacific Coast. The exploration of the interior was done largely by fui
traders seeking beaver and other valuable
peits.
,Settlement in eastern Canada followed,
largely agricultural in nature. The clearing of
land and the subsequent forest industry
either destroyed or greatly modified the

virgin hardwood and softwood forests over
much o! Canada.
When agriculture ran out of good hardwood
forest souls, expanding markets favoured logging beyond the limits of agricultuie. Whlle
the white pine lasted, its high quality opened
European and American markets. Then for a
hundred years Canada's cutting of virgin
timber has involved accepting more remote
cutting areas and often increasingly inferior
species. Canada's most productive forest land
now grows mainly small young trees.
Wihen good eastern souls became fully settled, the tide of agriculture swept to the prairies and rolled on to the mountains. Although
the ploughing of the prairies was not as visibly destructive as the cutting of the hardwoods, there was little biological difference.
Both involved the destruction of long established vegetation, changed the fertility of the
soils supporting it, and altered the water
regimes.
The pioneer attitude was, understandably,
to tame the wilderness in the quîckest and
easiest way. When centres of population were
no more than clearings in the forest, or patches of broken land in the unfenced prairie,
little concern could be generated for problems
of soil erosion, silting, pollution, resource
depletion and the like. As the population
increased oui problems started. Short termi
gains predominated but long terni losses were
initiated.
Soi]s were 'impoverished or eroded, watersheds destroyed and water tables lowered.
Fish and wildlife vanished or retreated, not
so much from. fishing and hunting as from the
destruction of their environents.
Canada's population grew. Villages grew to
towns, then cities. Industrial activity, after a
long slow start, accelerated rapidly to make
one of the world's smaller national populations into a leading industrial power. The
increased industrialization and accelerated
clustering of the Canadian population into a
f ew large cities lef t the face of Canada empfier in most places than it had been for
decades. The Economic Council has pointed
out that we are now the fastest urbanizing
western industrial society. By 1980 it is predicted that 80 per cent of Canada's people
will be living in urban areas.
Along with increasing industrialization
there has been an exploding volume of new
technological understanding. A rapid evolution of industries now produces new miracles
in physics and chemistry at ever accelerating
rates.

SENATE DEBATES
While urbanization
and technological
advances may have benefited our standard of
living, they have also meant new impacts on
our environment and new public pressures.
Part of the price we have paid has often been
air and water laden with wastes, solid refuse
littering
our landscape, substances
of
unknown toxicity constantly eaten and
breathed in and a daily environment polluted
by ugliness, noise and congestion.
Water and air pollution are particularly
serious threats. No one knows what ultimate
effects water pollution will have on the total
environment. It is known that severe losses of
wildlife and fish result from it and that
recreational use of water is being increasingly
denied. The growing human population, with
its growing water pollution consequence, and
the rising demand for clean water will meet
head on with the reality of supply.
Air pollution in many of our urban, industrialized areas, is known to adversely affect
people. The incidence of respiratory diseases
such as emphysema and bronchitis is higher
in urban polluted areas than non-urban areas.
Mixtures of pollutants which produce smog
also produce eye and throat irritations. The
annual cost of cleaning our buildings and
other structures and repairing air corrosion
damage is quite significant.
The Sixth Annual Review of the Economie
Council of Canada drew attention to the
many problems of pollution, and stressed particularly the necessity of considering the
environment as a whole in dealing with those
problems. Current concerns for pollution control or abatement are most encouraging, but I
would suggest that we clearly have a long
way to go before we can be confident that we
have things under control.
The philosophy of the pioneer was based
mainly on short-term needs for survival.
Destruction of the old environment was a
necessary part of creating a productive new
one. Mistakes and over-use were not serious
as long as one could pull up stakes and move
on, as many did. But the days of the pioneers
have in one sense ended.
There are now no new riches to move on
to. We are stuck with what we have. When
we leave a trail of wrecked landscape it must
now be someone's inheritance. Our room for
manoeuvering is rapidly drawing to a close
and we are face to face with the reality that
the basic requirements for life, air, water and
soil are not unlimited, can no longer carry
our refuse, and must be used wisely. The cost
of achieving a clean, attractive environment
[Hon. Mr. Macnaughton.]

November 25, 1969

will be high. The cost of not doing so will be
disastrous.
People are products of the land. It is a basic
rule in biological sciences that the quality of
all living things is in part a direct result of
the quality of their environments. Man is no
exception to that natural law. Man is a part
of the totality of living things. He has the
power to destroy all life and yet be bas the
power to treasure it and use it to enhance his
own life. The time has come for us to recognize this, directly and positively. The time
has come for Canadians to examine the quality of their environment, to identify problems
of environmental destruction, to devise ways
of securing quality control and to see that
those controls are carried out; in short, to
make decisions about their standard of life as
well as their standard of living.
Our physical and mental health demand it.
There are hazards to human health in
untreated sewage, concentrated motor vehicle
exhaust, circulating environmental threats of
radio-active fallout and pesticides and poisonous industrial effluents such as those that
contain mercury, cadmium or lead. Sustained
high noise levels are known to damage our
sense of hearing permanently. The congestion
and drabness of densely crowded enclaves are
blights to many of our cities. They cannot do
otherwise then provide little spiritual or emotional benefit to those forced by circumstance
to live and work there. Indeed it results in
the further alienation of many Canadians
fron their natural environment, from the
very forces which have molded man from his
beginnings. We do not have to accept such
conditions, because it is within our power
collectively to do something about them.
The maintenance of the productivity of our
environments demands our concern and
action. Are they maintaining their yield of
food, fibre, sport, amenity, beauty and solace
to man? To what extent has their bounty
declined? Can we satisfy our environmental
needs within a reasonable distance from
home? To what extent is poor land use planning contributing to environmental deterioration?
Wildlife, including fish, are sensitive indicators of environmental quality. The lethal
effects of pesticides and industrial effluents on
our wildlife have been well documented. The
changes in species, numbers and distribution
of wildlife that have taken place over the last
100 years reflect directly the altered countryside man has produced. Are we content with
those changes, or do we want to create the

November 25, 1969

DEBATES

right sort of habitats that will attract a variety of wildlife for our pleasure, education and
conscience?
The Canadian environent has played a
significant role in the Canadian identity.
Much of the Canadian tradition and legacy
concerns the striving of man to find a place i
nature, rather than, as i many nations, the
wars and quarrels of religions, races and
political systems. Our ftrst heroes were
explorers, pioneers and fur traders, rather
than tyrants or bandits. We stili draw some
vital part of our national character and identity from wilderness and white water, from
huntîng and fishing, from our knowledge of
the great uninhabited tracts of forests, the
immense and lonely barren grounds and the
high arctlc islands rimming the polar sea. We
should be proud of that heritage, recognize its
importance to our continued welf are and
safeguard it for future generations.
A post-war phenomenon i Canada has
been the rapid growth of outdoor recreation.
Our national and provincial parks, ocean and
lake beaches, fishing and hunting grounds, ski
resorts and countless other recreation areas
are facing unparalleled demands from the
public. Serious consideration may even have
to be given to restricting public use to ensure
the continued existence of natural recreation
areas. The very technology which produced
the leisure and means to travel and enjoy the
outdoors is threatening that outdoors in ways
I have already described. We must ensure
that our economic developments, so essentiai
to our nation, do not destroy in the end the
opportunity for Canadians to recreate themselves in healthful, aesthetlcally attractive
natural surroundings.
We must take into account the continued
growth of our population. One result of that
growth was that i 1967, 49.3 per cent of all
Canadians were under 25 years of age. As
that age group enters the labour market and
produces offspring of its own, one can forecast the great demands that will be made on
our environment. Looking at At from another
perspective, Canadians should be asking
thernselves how many people their resources
will support with a high standard of living, in
the environments we want. Unlike a number
of over-populated countries in the world,
Canada still has a choice before her-a high
population with a low standard of living, or a
low population with a high standard. I have
siznplified the choice, but its ultixnate inevitabllity is certain.

Although stili a young country, Canada has
a rich. history to which Indians, Eskimos and
Europeans have contributed. In our rush for
so-calied progress, we should not overlook
that history, nor neglect the archaeological
sites and historic structures which can enrich
our lives, add variety and interest to the
Canadian scene and strengthen our Canadian
identity.
I have outlined only some of the difficult
problems facing this country in conserving,
maintaining and using its environment. Our
governnients need the solutions to these problems. We must know what our environmental
resources are worth in cultural, health, economic and scientific ternis in order to plan
wisely for their conservation and their rationai development. We must categorize their
uses, gauge the strength of the demands,
assess their place in our national life and in
our national identity, determine their contribution to health and fitness, as well as to the
national economy, and judge the state of our
custodianship.
The conservation and maintenance needs of
the Canadian environment cannot be met by
mereiy introducing more barriers to economic
and technological development. The time has
long gone that a passive or negative approach
to conservation can be helpful. Man is changing hîs environxnent so rapidly that planning
prior to change is essential if environmental
quality goals are to be achieved. The issues to
be faced are highly technical, concerning such
diverse subjects as social attitudes, motives of
te market place, effects of environmnent on
mental and physical health and ecological
understanding of plant and animal communities.
To meet the challenge, it is vital that we
have a heaithy research community active in
the acquisition of basic knowledge and
deployed in a concerted and co-ordinated
attack on such urgent issues as are identifiable today. The monitoring of the environment, the definition of quality standards, and
the means of achieving and maintaining
them, all demand strong, scientific and technological competence and active involvement,
with the important element of continuity.
The necessity for federal competence in
enviromnental science is beyond question. Its
location i the federal Government structure,
and the invoivement of the university community, needs close scrutiny. The universities,
from which scientists i many disciplines
must be recruited, will require both the
encouragement of clearly stated objectives and
new funding if they are to move icreasingly

There are literally hundreds of agenciesfederal, provincial, municipal and privateinvolved in one way or another in determining the character of the Canadian
environment. A major problem is that there is
no overall policy or administrative framework
within which environmental destruction can
or controlled.
be measured, prevented
Improvements, therefore, cannot be initiated
except in ad hoc ways.
Within the federal Government there are a
number of departments with responsibilities
for natural resources. No single department,
however, has the responsibility for establishing an overall view of the effects of population growth, resource exploitation and urbanization on the quality of our environment and
on our standard of living.
The natural resource departments of provincial governments face a similar problem.
Municipal governments are exercising an
increasingly strong role in shaping the physical environments of their citizens, but in the
absence of clearly articulated provincial and
federal policies. What we require is a national
policy on the quality of the natural environments of Canada as a prime determinant of
the Canadian standard of living. Developing
this policy will require extensive examination
of the environmental problems facing us, definition of acceptable standards, and thorough
discussions with governments and the public.
When completed the policy must reflect our
collective ecological conscience, our acceptance of wise stewardship of our environment
for the benefit of our citizens and our natural
heritage. Our society is too mature, too
sophisticated and too knowledgeable to tolerate any longer mismanagement of our
resources.
In our federal system of government the
provinces have jurisdiction over most natural
resources, and it is essential, therefore, that
the establishment of a national policy be a
truly co-operative Canadian endeavour, with
the full participation of provincial governments in it. Upon agreement, the national
policy could serve as a framework for the
development of harmonious provincial policies. It is my hope that the provincial governments will recognize the national importance
of the problem and work toward its resolution with us.
The assessment of environmental problems
in Canada and the establishment of a national
policy on environmental quality in themselves
[Hon. Mr. Macnaughton.]

November 25, 1969

are insufficient to ensure that our surroundings will be what we want. Appropriate
administrative machinery is necessary to
implement the national policy and co-ordinate
and integrate those activities of federal
departments and agencies which are relevant
to that policy. Thorough examination of ways
and means of creating administrative and
research organizations in the federal Government is required.
In a land that is often harsh and unforgiving of errors, Canadians have struggled and
won for themselves one of the highest standards of living on earth. Yet now, as we
become increasingly aware of our environmental excesses, it appears that we are following a course which practically guarantees
a lower quality of life for all of us, and which
may even threaten our survival. Perhaps you
may think these last words are dramatic and
exaggerated. Well, let me call a few witnesses
and facts to your attention. U Thant, Secretary General of the United Nations, said
recently:
I do not wish to seem over-dramatie, but
I can only conclude from the information
that is available to me as Secretary General, that the members of the United
Nations have perhaps 10 years in which
to subordinate their ancient quarrels and
launch a global partnership to curb the
arms race, to improve the human environment, to defuse the population explosion and to supply the required momentum to world development efforts.
Former Prime Minister Pearson is reported
by the Canadian Press at the United Nations
to have put development aid in No. 4 position
after peace, war and pollution among the
important problems facing the world today.
Anthony Lewis, in the Montreal Star of
November 21, 1969, writes:
But if we are serious about the environment, some powerful country some day is
going to have to put that interest ahead
of prestige and profit and technological
advance. The public is beginning ta
appreciate that, and the result will surely
be felt in the polities of the future.

economist, who wrote in The Times of London that:

We shail need ta define ini sector after

Dr. Knelman, Prafessor of the History af
Science at Sir George Williams University
writes in the Montreal Star, May 30, 1969,
under the heading "Technolagy Runs Wfld":
What is it about this age that has
spread despair and unrest aver the entire
face af aur planet, earth? New waves ai
disquiet appear every day and the tides
af canflict increase in amplitude until
they threaten ta enguif and destray us.
The war is flot canfined ta Vietnam or

Affluence and poverty canfront each

The key ta unlacking the nature ai the
age af unrest lies in understanding what
is happening in the realm ai social
change. The second hall ai the 20th century is witnessing an unprecedented technological revolution. A science explosion
has created a new teehnological environment which has nat only transformed aur

but modified the anatamy ai aur perception. Science and technolagy are the new

the ocean in much the same way as rivers
and lakes have been killed by pollution.
Ocean pollution and marine conservation are
real issues.
There is general agreement that we are in
an ecological crisis of global proportions. Man
as a unit species is now collectively threatened and can only survive by a collective
response. The initial response should be an
accurate assessment of this global threat. Dr.
Knelman writes:
More than ever the scientist now has
the role of early warning system. There
is an increasing need to close the information gap between the few who know
and the many who do not know. A law is
only as good as the belief in its validity
and necessity. Hard anti-pollution laws
without public understanding and support are not workable because they do
not clarify the risk benefit balance. Neither industry nor government nor the
public are prepared to pay when only the
cost is known but the risk and benefit are
unknown and nobody will enforce a law
that threatens the economic status quo,
without this knowledge.
The task is one of mass information and mass
education on a national scale.
Canada should follow the lead of Sweden,
the first country to undertake an ambitious
and costly national program to purge her air
and waters of pollutants and prevent tbeir
pollution in the future. Sweden was the first
nation to impose a total ban on the use of
D.D.T. and other chlorinated hydrocarbon
pesticides. While much of Sweden's program
is straightforward, research, establishment of
standards, government financing of anti-pollution equipment, et cetera, there is a unique
but socially necessary element in their
scheme. This is a broad program of public
education on a national scale under control of
a federal government agency. Sweden has
realized the impossibility of enforcing existing legislation without public support. Their
program is characterized more by foresight
than crisis response.
Honourable senators, somewhere during the
course of this rather long speech in support of
the motion before us, I said:
We do not have to accept such conditions,
because it is within our power, collectively, to do something about them.
It is becoming increasingly evident that economic factors alone cannot provide a satisfying or healthy standard of living. A clean

environment, space, natural beauty and quietness add immeasurably to the quality of life.
The wise use and conservation of natural
resources are essential in our modern society.
Pollution has become a political catchword.
Public and private concern is on the march.
The focus of public concern is largely local or
regional but the problem of environmental
pollution is rapidly becoming international
and global. Proof of this is evident in the
calling of a United Nations Conference on
human environment in 1972.
Put in simple terms, I believe it is the duty
of the Government, or any government, "to
draw attention to the many problems of pollution and especially to consider the environment as a whole in dealing with those
problems."
One practical and useful step at this stage
would be the setting up of a special committee to assess the current quality of the
Canadian environment and assist in the identification of the most pressing problems. This
would involve the Senate directly in an issue
of great public concern. With the co-operation
and assistance of federal departments and
research agencies, whether they be federal,
provincial, university, industrial and professional groups, or individuals, the proposed
committee would be in a position to conduct a
thorough and most useful inquiry.
And at this stage one of the most important
jobs the committee could do, with the full cooperation of the press, radio and television
outlets, would be to focus public attention on
the problems under study.
This in itself, I believe, would be a service
to our citizens generally and certainly of aid
and assistance to the Government in later
stages. We have an unparalleled opportunity
to act decisively in the interest of all Canadians to make our country a better place in
which to live.
The motion before us is designed to accomplish this very purpose. I do hope that it will
receive the unanimous approval of this chamber, without undue delay, and that the committee will be constituted and commence its
investigation of environmental problems as
soon as possible.
Hon. Hartland de M. Molson: Honourable
senators, I would like to propose an amendment to the motion of the honourable Senator
Macnaughton. In amendment, I move, seconded by Senator Carter, that the motion be not
now adopted but that it be amended by

November 25, 1969

SENATE DEBATES

inserting immediately after the penultimate
paragraph thereof, the following:
That the conmnittee before assuming any
financial obligations submit to the Standing Committee on Internal Economy and
Contingent Accounts a budget for approval setting forth in reasonable detail
the forecast of expenses to be incurred.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, it has been moved by honourable Senator Macnaughton, seconded by honourable
Senator Robichaud, that a Special Committee
of the Senate be appointed to consider and
reportHon. Senators: Dispense.
The Hon. the Speaker: In amendment to
the motion, it is moved by honourable Senator Molson, seconded by honourable Senator
Carter, that the motion be not now adopted
but that it be amended by inserting immediately after the penultimate paragraph thereof,
the following:
That the committee before assuming any
financial obligations submit to the Standing Committee on Internal Economy and
Contingent Accounts a budget for
approval setting forth in reasonable
detail the forecast of expenses to be
incurred.
The question is on the amendment.
Hon. Leopold Langlois: Honourable senators, I move, seconded by honourable Senator
Smith, that this debate be adjourned to
Friday, December 19.
Hon. Mr. Molson: Honourable senators, I
have moved an amendment and I should be
allowed an opportunity to make some
remarks on it. May I ask whether it is in
order for me to say why I proposed the
amendment?
The Hon. the Speaker: In my opinion it is
perfectly in order for honourable Senator
Molson to elaborate on the amendment he has
moved.
Hon. Mr. Molson: Honourable senators, I
appreciate the opportunity to explain, because
at first glance this amendment might sound
provocative or designed to delay or disrupt in
some way. Of course there is no intention to
do any such thing.
The point to which I would like to call the
attention of honourable senators is that the

Committee on Internal Economy and Contingent Accounts, in discussion last week, dealt
with the budget of the Senate. At that time
the subject of the expenses of special committees was brought up, and it was felt that in
future it would be desirable, when empowering comuittees to incur expenses, that they
be asked to submit budgets at the same time.
If that is not done, the Senate has absolutely
no control and, far worse, it has no knowledge of the sums of money which it is inviting-and this is quite within its powers-its
committees to incur.
I do not wish in any way to take over the
duties of the chairman of the Internal Economy Committee, and I hope that Senator Smith
does not disagree with my bringing this point
to the attention of the chamber. In fact, if he
had chosen to move this amendment, I would
have been very happy indeed.
As honourable senators will remember, special committees are required now to submit
an account of their expenditures. This was
provided in Rule 84, which the Senate adopted. In discussing this matter in the Internal
Economy Committee the other day, on the
question of control by the Senate over its
own budget, it was agreed that future committees should be asked to submit a budget,
as I have indicated in the amendment.
Honourable senators, that is the only purpose in submitting this amendment. In view
of the necessity to control our expenses, I
think it is desirable to apply this provision in
the case of any special committees which we
appoint from now on.
Hon. Arthur W. Roebuck: Honourable senators, may I say that I am in favour of the
amendment which has been proposed, with
this exception, that I do not like to see a
general proposal such as this, which should
apply to all committees, concentrated on one
committee, as this amendment is.
There is no doubt that we should be able to
control, or have a committee control the
expenses, not only of special committees but
of all committees.
As chairman of the special committee
studying the question of divorce, which had a
most favourable result, I was amazed to find
that I could order almost anything, that by
simply signing my name on the invoice it
would be paid. I should point out that that
committee was handled in a very inexpensive
way. At the same time, I had the authority
and I thought it amazing that I could make

SENATE DEBATES
almost any expenditure I pleased. Such a system is not a good business on the part of this
chamber.
However, I do not like to see a general rule
of this kind concentrated, by chance, on a
motion which comes to the floor at this time. I
do not think we should pass this amendment.
This ought to be a general motion, carefully
thought out by the committee and made
applicable to all committees, not just one. It
could be made effective to this committee as
to all other committees, and there is plenty of
time to do it. I do not like to see this amendment proposed by honourable Senator Molson
in this manner. I think it is a mistake to
apply the principle to one particular
committee.
Hon. Donald Smith: Honourable senators, it
would seem appropriate that I should say
something about this matter.
As chairman of the Internal Economy Committee and as one who knows something of
the background leading up to the amendment
proposed by Senator Molson, may I say first
that I agree with the language of the amendment. I did not have time to write it down,
but it seems to agree almost word for word
with the resolution which was passed at the
last meeting of the Internal Economy
Committee.
In the judgment of the Internal Economy
Committee we found it very difficult to
propose a general, all-embracing resolution,
without seeking additional powers from the
Senate to do so. The Leader of the Opposition
came to our rescue. He pointed out that in the
Senate we do many things, and do not do
many other things, by virtue of practice
rather than of rule; and he suggested something with which I could readily agree. He
asked if it would solve our problem of lack
of control over expenditures and the lack
of purchasing procedure, if we recommended
that in future a practice be instituted in the
operation of the Senate whereby a motion to
set up a special committee-which ordinarily
has in it no reference to the control of
expenditures-should include the kind of
provision which honourable Senator Molson
has suggested now in his amendment.
This was agreed to not only by the committee but by the Leader of the Government,
who very gladly accepted the suggestion of
the Leader of the Opposition.
Now, may I assure Senator Roebuck that
there is no question of co-operation between
Senator Molson and me. I was not aware that
he was going to propose an amendment at all.
[Hon. Mr. Roebuck.]

November 25, 1969

The fact is that this was the only motion on
our order paper today. Had this motion been
already introduced and occupied a position on
our order paper, I think the Leader of the
Government or another member of the Senate
would have amended that motion. We would
hope, if the practice is acceptable, that in
future any individual senator who desires to
bring to the attention of the Senate a serious
problem of national importance deserving to
be inquired into extensively would frame his
motion in such a way that it would not be
necessary for Senator Molson or the Leader
of the Government or anyone else to alter
that motion in this respect.
I hope I have cleared up any doubt in Senator Molson's mind with respect to my supporting his amendment. I do so wholeheartedly in every detail.
Furthermore, I hope that my unprepared
explanation to Senator Roebuck is such that
he understands we are not picking on this
particular motion, but that it is the only one
on our order paper and it was placed there
before we had expressed the opinion that
from now on control should be instituted.
That is why it is being dealt with in this way.
I shall be glad to support the motion when
it comes before us.
Hon. Mr. Macnaughton: Honourable senators, perhaps you will allow me to say a
word. I agree thoroughly with the principle
contained in my learned friend's suggestion
but, as a practical measure I do think that the
suggestion
of the
honourable
Senator
Roebuck should be followed.
In any event, it seems perfectly clear to me
that in respect of any Senate committee
involving considerable expense, as a committee of this nature would, the first thing that
its chairman should do is prepare a budget. I
do not see how even one dollar could be
given to him without the submission of a
budget and without the approval of the
authorities. So there is no dispute on the
principle; it is just bad business to operate
that in any other way.
The Hon. the Speaker: It is moved by the
honourable Senator Macnaughton, seconded
by Senator Roebuck, that a special committee
of the Senate be appointed to considerHon. Senators: Dispense.

QUARANTINE BILL
ORDER FOR SECOND READING STANDS

FLAX
LOSS

OF SALES-LAKEHEAD
QUESTIONS

SHORTAGE-

Hon. Walter M. Aseltine: Honourable senators, I have a question to put to the Leader of
the Government having to do with the loss of
certain sales of flax which has occurred
recently.
My reason for asking this question tonight
is that I have just read an article in the
Winnipeg Free Press weekly of November 8.
Had I had this information when I made my
speech on the Throne debate the other day, I
should have brought it up then. This article is
headed: "Flax Sales Lost-Lakehead Shortage-Winnipeg". It says that orders for
Canadian flax have been switched to the
United States for filling because of the short
supply of flax at the Lakehead, and that the
shortage has already cost Canada at least two
million bushels in lost sales.
My questions are:
1. Who is in charge of the transportation of
flax to the Lakehead?
2. Why was there not enough flax at the
Lakehead to fill commitments for Canadian
flax, the 1969 flax crop being over 30 million
bushels?
3. Who was responsible for the shortagethe railways, the grain trade, the Wheat
Board trade?

On the Orders:
Second reading of Bill S-12, intituled:
"An Act to prevent the introduction into
Canada of infectious or contagious
diseases".-(Honourable Senator Sullivan).
Hon. John M. Macdonald: Honourable senators, I should like to stand this order in the
name of Senator Sullivan, but perhaps in
doing so I may be permitted to give a word in
explanation.
Senator Sullivan is very anxious to speak
on this bill, and I know he will make a very
fine contribution to the debate. Unfortunately,
he cannot be here this week because some
time ago he accepted a invitation from the
Los Angeles Foundation of Otology to deliver
a lecture to its professional staff on the subject of "Facial Nerve Abnormalities". He has
gone to California for this purpose.
I should add that this organization is a
non-profit foundation
dedicated to ear
research. It is a well-known and highly
respected foundation in the United States and
its board of trustees, its advisory board and
its medical board are comprised of very eminent men. It is a tribute to the high international professional reputation which Senator
Sullivan enjoys that he has been invited to
give this lecture by such an outstanding
organization and to give it before such a dis-

INTER-PARLIAMENTARY UNION
FIFTY-SEVENTH ANNUAL CONFERENCE HELD
AT NEW DELHI, INDIA
Hon. Chesley W. Carter rose pursuant to
notice:

That he will call the attention of the
Senate to the Fifty-seventh Annual Conference of the Inter-Parliamentary Union
held at New Delhi, India, 30th October to
7th November, 1969, and in particular to
the discussions and proceedings of the
Conference and the participation therein
of the delegation from Canada.
He said: Honourable senators, this was the
first time I attended a conference of the InterParliamentary Union. It was one of the most
valuable and rewarding experiences of my
life. Though I have been a member of our
Canadian branch of I.P.U. for over 20 years,
not until I attended this conference did I fully
realize what the I.P.U. was all about. I know
that most, perhaps all, honourable senators
are well informed about the Inter-Parliamentary Union. In order to make my remarks
more meaningful to those outside this chamber who may read today's Hansard, I crave
your indulgence while I take a few minutes to
give a brief thumbnail sketch of this organization, its purposes and objectives and how it
operates.
The Inter-Parliamentary Union is a very
old organization. It came into existence in the
year 1888, as a result of the efforts of William Randall Cramer, a member of the British House of Commons, and Frederick Passy,
a member of the French Chamber of Deputies. Through the efforts of these two
[Hon. Mr. Hayden.]

November 26, 1969

pioneers, the first Inter-Parliamentary Conference was held in Paris, on June 29 and 30,
1889, with the participation of 49 members
representing the parliaments of nine different
countries. Since then the membership has

grown to 67 parliamentary groups.
To qualify for membership, the national
groups must be constituted in parliaments
functioning as such within the territory of
which they represent the population, in a
state or nation that is recognized as a subject
of international law. It follows therefore that
not all nations of the world today are eligible
for membership.
The Inter-Parliamentary Union has three
principal organs, namely, the Inter-Parliamentary Council, the Executive Committee,
and the International Parliamentary Bureau.
The Inter-Parliamentary Council is the
body that directs and supervises the activities
of the whole organization. It is composed of
two members from each regularly affiliated
national group. The council elects its president for a period of three years, and this term
may be extended for a further two years,
after which he is no longer eligible.
The Executive Committee is the administrative organ of the union. It exercises the
functions delegated to it by the council in
conformity with the statutes or constitution.
The committee is composed of 11 members
belonging to different groups. The president
of the council is ex-officio member and president of the Executive Committee. The ten
other members are elected by the plenary
conference for a term of four years. They are,
however, not eligible for re-election for the
next two years.
The Inter-Parliamentary Bureau is the
international secretariat of the union, and is
located at Geneva. It is headed by a paid
secretary-general appointed by the Inter-Parliamentary Council, with some parliamentary
staff necessary to carry out the functions of
the bureau.
Within this framework another body was
set up in 1938, known as the Association of
Secretaries-General. This body is composed of
the secretaries of the various legislative

assemblies, and its purpose is to provide an
opportunity for these secretaries from widely
varying parliamentary institutions to co-operate in the technical study of the problems of
parliamentary life. The Association of Secretaries-General has its own organization and
its own executive committee, but its activities
are financed from the budget of the union
itself. Usually its meetings are held at the

November 26, 1969

SENATE DEBATES

same time and place as those of the InterParliamentary Union.
As a general rule, Inter-Parliamentary conferences are convened annually and are held
in the capitals of the various member countries. This last conference was the fifty-seventh and was held in New Delhi because this
is the centenary year of the birth of the great
Mahatma Gandhi. By making its conference
coincide with the centenary celebrations, the
Inter-Parliamentary Union manifested its
deep affection and respect for that great
humanitarian and the ideals for which he
lived and died. This was further confirmed by
a formal resolution which was passed by the
conference in its closing plenary session.
The Inter-Parliamentary Union is, therefore, an international association, possessing a
semi-official character
of parliamentary
groups constituted within the national parliaments of various countries of the world. The
aim of the union as set forth in its statutes is
as follows:
To promote personal contacts between
members of all parliaments, constituted
international groups, and to unite them
in common action to secure and maintain
the full participation of their respective
states in the firm establishment and development of democratic institutions and in
the advancement of the work of international peace and co-operation, particularly
by means of a universal organization of
nations.

and went on to refer to the parliamentary
system in these words:
A parliamentary system flourishes and
is sustained not by rigid adherence to
rules of procedure or by insistence on
dogmas or theories, but by its capacity to
respond and react purposefully to the
needs of the community of people whom
it seeks to govern. The state in a parliamentary democracy is not an end in
itself. It is a means for the purpose of
binding men together in a justly ordered
social life. The parliamentary system also
emphasizes human dignity, the importance of the individual and the right of
dissent. It creates and encourages meaningful public opinion so that all problems
may be decided by discussion, adjustment
of views and acceptance of consensus. As
has been well said by Woodrow Wilson,
democracy "releases the energy of every
human being."
Later on, he quoted Mahatma Gandhi as
saymg:
Man becomes great exactly in the degree
in which he works for the welfare of his
fellow men.

The working sessions of the conference
were held in the Vigyan Bhavan, which is the
people's House of the Indian Parliament.
The first item on the agenda was the Secretary-General's report which is the equivalent
of our Speech from the Throne, and served to

between nations. He then showed how these
During the year these topics had been studideals were embodied in India's constitution, ied by study committees instituted by the

SENATE DEBATES
Inter-Parliamentary Coundil. The general
procedure was to initiate the debate by a
brief statement by the rapporteur of the
study committee, together with a draft resolution also prepared by the study committee.
The general debate on each topie would be
held in plenary session and then it would be
sent to the appropriate committee where the
draft resolution would be either endorsed or
amended by the committee, but in each case
the committee would report back again to the
plenary session where the draft resolution
would be ratified either in its original or
amended form.
The Canadian delegation, which included
three senators-Senator Langlois, Senator
Edgar Fournier and myself-and eleven
Members of Parliament, took a very active
part in all these proceedings, both in plenary
session and in committee. Each Member of
Parliament made a very brief but important
contribution on the topic in which he had
special interest, and our own Senator Fournier very ably upheld the traditions of the
Senate in his contribution to the debate on
measures for the prohibition of the production and use of nuclear and thermonuclear
weapons.
The leader of our delegation was Mr. Grant
Deachman, M.P. Here I should like to pay
tribute to the outstanding leadership which
he displayed throughout the whole conference. Briefing sessions were held in his room
at eight o'clock in the morning, during which
we were briefed on the topics to be discussed
during the day, the attitudes of delegations
from other countries and possible developments that might take place, particularly
those arising out of amendments contemplated by certain delegations which had very
strong feelings about the topics to be discussed. As a result of these early morning
meetings, Canada's position was very carefully thought out and the speakers selected to
make Canada's position clear either at the
debate in plenary session or in committee. It
followed, therefore, that Canada's position on
the various issues was maintained with firmness and in such a manner as to maintain the
friendship and respect of those delegations
who held views very different from ours. No
delegation had a better record of attendance
than ours. The Canadian presence was maintained in practically full force in all the committees as well as in the plenary session.
Included in the Canadian delegation were
Miss Jean McPherson, the secretary to the
delegation, and Mr. J. Gordon Dubroy, Clerk
Assistant to the House of Commons, who
[Hon. Mr. Carter.]

November 26, 1969

attended the meetings of the Association of
Secretaries-General. A special word of tribute
is due to Miss McPherson, who did a wonderful job in keeping the delegates informed as
to each day's agenda, the issues involved, and
the people taking part. She also kept us
informed with regard to developments in
delegations from other countries and, in addition to that, looked after all our arrangements
and appointments with regard to social
engagements, our transportation to and from
the places where these social events were
being held, as well as looking after our passports, reservations and other general transportation arrangements. I do not think it is an
exaggeration to say that the efficiency of the
Canadian delegation and the smoothness and
effectiveness of the manner in which we were
able to operate was due in large measure to
her efforts.
In a report of this kind one cannot, and, in
my opinion should not, avoid the question of
the value of this particular conference and,
indeed, of the Inter-Parliamentary Union
itself. In the context of today's world, does it
serve any useful purpose? Is it actually
worthwhile? Does it make a worthwhile contribution towards achieving peace in the
world and understanding between member
nations?
At the final plenary session of the conference certain resolutions were endorsed relating to the various topics on the agenda which
I referred to earlier in my speech. These resolutions reflect the general objectives of the
union and, as one of the delegates to this
conference, it is my duty on my return to try
to exert some influence within our own Parliament of Canada in favour of these objectives, and to do what I can to secure action by
the Parliament of Canada on the resolutions
adop'ed by this and previous Inter-Parliamentary Conferences.
The more I considered the question, the
more I wondered what I, as one delegate,
could do to discharge these obligations when I
got back to Canada. Of course I could write
letters to the Prime Minister and to the
appropriate minister concerning the resolutions adopted, but I have no illusions that
such letters would have much influence on
government policy, particularly where the
policy of our present Government is at variance with policy implicit in the resolutions
adopted. Then it occurred to me that in a
democracy, as President Giri pointed out, the
people are sovereign and governments must
respond to the wishes of the people. So, in

November 26. 1969

Novebor26, 969SENATE
DEBATES

addition to a direct approach to the Government, I should also endeavour to make an
approach to the people of Canada by letters
to the press and by speaking on the subjects
whenever an opportunity presents itself. It
has occurred to me also that one very good
way of doing this would be to initiate debates
in this chamber on the resolutions adopted by
the Inter-Parliamentary Union, so that the
Senate as a body can be informed, and as
individuals we may take whatever action
seems appropriate to further these objectives
whenever we find a suitable opportunity. This
is someLhing which I hope those of us who
attended the conference wrnl be able to discuss with our leader in the Senate.
With respect to the conference's contribution towards peace in the world and better
understanding between nations, I personally
doubt that very much can be accomplished in
this regard unless the delegations from
member nations leave behind them their
prejudices, their hatreds and their confiicts.
Unless they do that, I do not see how they
can make a positive approach to the problems
with which the conference attempted to deal.
As an illustration, I should point out that in
his report the Secretary-General made reference to the situation in the Middle East. The
delegation from the United Arab Republic
placed an interpretation on his words at
which they took off ence. They therefore
walked out of the conference completely and
took no further part in its deliberations.
This intense feeling, which probably can be
described as akin to hatred, was evident in
practically ail the speeches made by the delegations from Israel and Kuwait.
The Soviet Union and its satellites also
seized the opportunity to take the same line
as they usually do in the United Nations and
similar organizations, thus making the conference a sounding board for their propaganda,
as was pointed out by Senator Yuzyk in his
brilliant speech a few days ago. Certainly as
long as this kind of atmosphere is maintained
and fostered, the chances of the conference
producing concrete positive resuits in the
cause of peace and better understanding
between nations must remain comparatively
slim.
As this was my first attendance at the
conference, I have no basis for comparison
with previous conferences and therefore no
means of knowing whether the situation I
have described is the saine today as it was
years ago, or whether it has improved.
21498--15

As against the negative speeches to which I
have just referred, there were on the other
hand some very positive speeches. This leads
me to think that the situation bas improved
and, if not, it certainly constitutes evidence
that improvement can be attained in the
future. Because of their positive outiook, in
my opinion these contributions were the highlights of the debates that took place and for
that reason 1 should like to quote from two of
them.
The first positive speech was made by Mr.
Peter Petersen, who is a member of the Bundestag and leader of the delegation from the
Federal Republic of Germany. This is what
Mr. Petersen said:
Mr. President,' Ladies and Gentlemen:
The President of India when hie gave
us the honour of opening this conference
may have given us the key to our problems when hie said that Gandhi had had
a dream that kindled this nation-a
dreani of peace and freedom and brotherhood of men.
Mahatma Gandhi belongs to all of us, to
the whole world. What would his life
mean for us today in this strife torn
world?
1 would like to say a word to my Polish
colleagues: Your speaker, the Honourable
Mr. Wende, said yesterday that the
people of Poland will neyer forget the
sufferings and sacrifices of the war.
The Polish delegate had made a speech the
previous day.
As a German I understand that. Hitler
and Stalin divided your country. The
German Army marched in and millions
of your people suffered and died. I know
that we cannot expect you to forget-I
would like to ask you to forgive.
And then in the terrible wînter 19441945, millions of Germans were driven
from their homes. Hundreds of thousands
died. My people suffered deeply. Most of
them, especially the women and children,
had committed only one crime-to be
born German.
Much bittemness was in my country too.
And bitterness, unless healed, can cause
new hatred and confiict.
The Russian and the Indian delegates
complained that the Communist German
Parliament bas not yet been accepted in
these halls. I beg you to understand that
we Germans want to live like anybody
else. We don't want to live behind a wall

SENATE DEBATES
and be shot and killed when we want to
go from one part of our country to another. We want to read any paper we are
interested in reading, whether the government likes the article or not. Our
journalists too want to write what they
like, without censorship. We want to be
able to travel anywhere in the world
without having to ask government for
permission. We Germans-all of usdon't want to belong to the government.
Our government should belong to us.
That is why I don't want to sit at a
table with delegates of a regime that
owns eighteen million of my countrymen.
We Germans know how power corrupts. We learned that from history too.
That is why we want a government dedicated to freedom and peace; a government that gets power only for a limited
time, that is controlled while il is in
power by a freely elected parliament and
an independent court of law.
We don't want to impose this on anybody else, but we Germans, all of us, long
for that. If in this way we can determine
our own fate and control those in power,
we don't mind whether we live in one
state or two or five or six. The German
problem is not one of organization but of
freedom. Lasting peace can only live
where there is freedom and justice-that
has taught
Gandhi
Mahatma
too
mankind.
Mr. Wende, the Polish delegate, talked
about the Oder-Neisse-Line. Let me
humbly suggest, sir, that borders are not
the problem or the solution. Nowhere in
Europe can you draw a line that clearly
divides two people from one another,
because for hundreds of years we have
been living together.
Let me give you one example: my
grandparents were Danish. As long as I
can remember, my father had bitter disputes with his Danish cousins about the
border line between Denmark and Germany. The Danish people also have suffered greatly in the last war. But my
Danish colleagues will bear me out when
I say that since Danish children can go to
Danish schools in Germany and vice versa-I can go to a German church in Denmark, we trade, we travel, we marry, we
can settle here or there, nobody is interested any more in the border line.
[Hon. Mr. Carter.]

November 26, 1969

Is that not the way peoples are meant
to live together? The best security of a
country lies in the confidence of her
neighbours. To win the confidence of our
neighbours in the East, as we have won it
in the West, is the most important task of
our government, my Parliament and my
people.
Let us, my fellow delegates, dedicate
our lives to create a world free of hate
and fear and greed; a world free of suspicion and of walls between men and
nations. India has much to give to the
world. All of us would be richer if we
would so interpret the life of Gandhi for
our deeply troubled times.
Another speech was made by Mrs. Margit
Borg-Sundman from Finland, speaking to the
resolution on the role of parliaments in the
protection of the human environment and
conservation of natural resources. She said:
Having reached its present high level
of material development, is mankind now
going to destroy itself by slow poisoning
of air and water by unlimited exploitation of natural resources? Wc are indeed
paying a high price for our so-called progress-too high a price. The wonderful
accomplishments of technology without
adequate control of its consequences, the
wave of materialism with the high
material standard of living as its new
God are now rapidly leading to a catastrophic imbalance in nature and to a real
danger for human living conditions.
All that can be done to prevent this
catastrophe must be done and done
quickly. Among the causes of the rapidly
worsening situation has been, beside the
striving for a high material standard of
living, our lack of knowledge, our indifference, our shortsightedness, our inability to see apparently insignificant details
as significant parts of an important
whole. The problem is anything but easy.
We achieve no positive results by
approaching the problem superficially
and emotionally, or by reproaching one
another. And we reach only partial solutions if we don't look at the problem as a
whole.
The whole chain of causes must be
analyzed. Side by side with the pollution
of air and water by industry, there is
urbanization with its poisons, not the
least of which is the acoustic poison, the
noise. The new status symbol, the
automobile, has brought both the poison

Novemler 26. 1969

EAE

of noise and the poison of its exhaust.
The new electric cars are thus badiy
needed. Furthermore, there are insecticides and artificial. fertilizers used in
agriculture. There are also the chemicals
used in detergents, etc. Ail our forces
must be mobilized for effective co-operation in protecting the environmient. There
must be effective ca-aperatian among
researchers, social planners and other
experts, including industry, landowners
and, flot least, parliamentarians.
The exploitation and the pollution of
environent are world-wide phenomena.
The ratianal use of natural resources and
the protection af the human enviranment
is thus a universal goal for ail nations
and individuais. It is a task for international ca-operation. Here in aur InterParliamentary Union we should share our
experiences and try tagether ta find even
better new forms of co-operation. It is our
task to support and to speed the plans of
the United Nations in this question, so
vital for the whole of humanity.
We parliamentarians can be rightly
reproached for our delay in having realized the importance of the probiem and
for our having failed ta take interest in it
in time. We shouid have listened ta the
warning vaices. Althaugh it is the eleventh haur, it is not yet toa late. We can
still do many things ta correct aur
mistakes.
First of ail, we must increase aur own
understanding of the problem. We must
continue ta gather facts ta imprave aur
knawiedge. We must then establish
bodies of experts and foster effective
teamwork between governiment, industry
and experts.
Further, we must subsidize the training
of experts and the carrying on of cantinuous research work. We must provide
the financial means.
Then, of course, we must do our main
job, which is legisiatian. New laws are
needed far the protectian of enviranmient
and ail iaws must be amended and modernized. We must clase up the loopholes
and eliminate the exceptions that prevent
the iaws fromn being enfarced. This
should nat, however, lead ta killing of the
work af enterprises. The protection of the
human environment should be seen as a
part of social policy and thus a task for
the whole society.
21498-15*

It is important for parliaments ta do
their part also in seeing ta it that knawledge regarding environmiental control, is
widely spread among the public and that

Canstructive contributions were made also
by Senatar Sparkman and Cangressmen Daddaria and McClary of the U.S. delegation and
a number of others.

The I.P.U. alsa affards a unique opportunity
foar parliamentarians from ail over the worid,
representing cauntries with wideiy varying
histarical backgraunds, parliamentary traditions and institutions, ta get together ta know
each ather personally and ta farm persanai
friendships which must in turn iead to better
mutual understanding. It did this for members of aur delegatian, which also represented
different palitical parties and widely varying
viewpaints. When we add these benefits ta
the patential for a positive approach ta world
prablems, which I mentianed earlier, I think
the answer ta my question must be that while
the achievements af the Inter-Pariiamentary
Union and its annual conferences cannot be
measured in specific, cancrete ternis, neyertheless this institution can make a valuable
contributian ta the solution of worid problemns
and greater ca-aperatian between nations.
Therefore, it merits aur support.
One af the highlights of the I.P.U. Conference was an address by Mrs. Indira Gandhi,
Prime Minister af India, in which she gave a
brief autline of the prablims the cauntry had
ta face, af the measures being taken ta salve
them, of the successes that already have been
achieved, and the work that stili remains to
be dane.
In addition ta the benefits I have just
enumerated, the Inter-Parliamentary Conference affords parliamentarians ail over the

SENATE DEBATES

November 26, 1969

about the conference itself, and I know also
that Senator Langlois wishes to say something
on the same subject. With this in mind, I have
not prepared what might be called formal
notes but I should like to tell you of my
impressions.
First, I should like to thank my associates,
Senator Langlois and Senator Carter, and all
members of the delegation that went to India.
It would be difficult to find a better group of
Canadian citizens.
As a delegation, we were well prepared and
briefed before we commenced our journey,
and we represented, not the political parties
to which we belong, but Canada. There were
no politics involved-we represented a strong
Canadian front.
I should like to thank the Right Honourable
Pierre Elliott Trudeau, because I know that
he had to approve my inclusion in the delegation. I also thank the honourable Leader of
the Government (Hon. Mr. Martin), and my
own leader (Hon. Mr Flynn), and other members of this house for whom I have very
warm feelings.
I was pleased at being selected, and as a
Canadian I tried to live up to that honour by
performing to the very best of my ability.
This visit to India is something I shall
never forget. It was well organized all the
way through. We soon discovered that Canada is well recognized in under-privileged
countries. The name "Canada" was recognized
by all those to whom we spoke.
To me the most worthwhile experience was
not so much with the representatives of the
different nations at the conference, but the
contacts with people in the mornings and the
evenings. I met many people whose problems
were similar to our own. Such contacts, in my
opinion, are essential and of great value. One
soon begins to realize that Canada is a very
privileged country, and that the underdeveloped countries need our assistance. You
realize the difficulties and problems that these
countries with huge populations face, and for
which there are no solutions in the foreseeable future.
Since I have been a member of the Senate I
have been privileged to visit two of the most
underdeveloped countries of the world, Africa
and India. The problems of Africa and India
are similar but, in my opinion, there is a vast
difference in culture and social life. Africa is

ence, I am sure there is little else to be said of India the people have a primitive way of

world the opportunity to see these problems
for themselves and to get a first-hand knowledge of the Indian people, of their great and
wonderful country, of their culture and traditions, of their aspirations and achievements,
as well as of their failures and their needs.
The Indian people are extremely kind, hospitable and considerate. They proved to be
ideal hosts. The Indian delegation which was
led by Dr. G. S. Dhillon, Speaker of Lok
Sabha of the People's House, did everything
in their power to look after all our needs and
to make our stay in India pleasant and enjoyable. Mr. Speaker Dhillon himself played a
key role in the conference because he presided over the plenary sessions and, in addition,
he arranged for us many social events including dinner parties, cultural excursions and
evenings of entertainment which included
Indian music and dancing performed by
India's most talented artists. He arranged also
a performance of son et lumière which
depicted the great events in India's history,
and illustrated how the history of the City of
Delhi was constantly interwoven with the history of India itself.
Mr. Speaker Dhillon spoke in glowing
terms of his visit to Canada when he attended
the Speakers' Conference earlier this year,
and from all sides and groups it was evident
that in India there is a very great reservoir of
good will towards Canada and the Canadian
people which we, on our part, assured them
was very heartily reciprocated. I for one feel
certain that the ties of friendship between
Canada and India have become even stronger
as a result of this conference.
Honourable senators, it is very difficult to
compress in the space of a few minutes the
events of a ten-day conference. Al I have
been able to do is give you a very brief
outline, and I trust that my colleagues from
the Senate who also attended this conference
will elaborate on what I have said and fill in
the gaps that I have left.
Before I conclude, however, I should like to
say one word of appreciation of our Ambassador in Delhi, Mr. James George, and his good
wife and staff, who were extremely kind and
helpful to us. They, along with our Indian
hosts, did everything in their power to make
our stay in India pleasant and enjoyable, and
our contribution to the conference as effective
as possible.

life and earning their daily bread is their
main objective. India is a country where both
men and women have to work very hard. I
should like to take a minute or two to give
you a few examples.
We stayed at the Hotel Asoka, which is a
huge building erected by the Government. It
is now undergoing repair, and a wall is being
altered on the second floor. From observing
this operation on several occasions I think I
can fairly say that thirty skilled Canadian
tradesmen-carpenters, plumbers, and so onwould complete that job in one month. I was
told that this particular job will employ 600
people for five months.
I was fascinated to watdh twelve women
hauling bricks on their heads. Each of them
carried sixteen bricks at a Urne on a littie
wooden platform. These bricks were roughly
made and were obviously quite heavy. The
women, who were barefooted, had to carry
the bricks some 400 feet, passing over stairways and floors that were like gravel roads.
They would unload the bricks two at a Urne,
dropping them onto a pile of sand. Then they
would return slowly for another load. They
did this from. 8 o'clock in the morning until 5
o'clock in the evening for two rupees, or 28
cents.
There was no break for coffee, and there
was no time to talk. While there, on one
occasion we stopped three or four persons in
order to get our pictures taken with them;
soon the foreman came along, and it was not
long before that was ended and the brick
hauling commenced.
These workers were ail young girls aged,
we were told, from 14 to 18 years. A few had
small children, who were tethered to a large
stone by one leg, which allowed them to play
on the sand pile. When they needed attention
one of the women would break off for a few
moments in order to do what was necessary.
The men were paid three rupees or 42 cents a
day.
I saw one man drilling holes in hardwood
with a twist drill, a tool that was used 2,000
years ago. It is like a bow and spool, and is
worked in the manner of playing the violin. I
wished I had had a little hand drill toi give
him. It would have made his job much easier.
We were told that one of the reasons they do
things in this way is that they are trying to
employ everybody. They do not have the
policy we have here in Canada; it is completely different. In front of the hotel they
were building a stone wall. There were
approximately 50 or 75 women hauling gravel

ln baskets on their heads a distance of about
haîf a mile. They started at eight o'clock in
the morning and walked about a haîf mile to
the gravel pit, coming back with a basket full
of gravel Which they dumped behind the wall.
They then turned right back, walking about
20 feet apart, very slowly. Nobody was pushing them, but there was no pause; they just
kept moving ail day long. You would be
amazed at the amount of gravel that 50 or 75
women could haul i one day. You could see
the walls going up.
Before I refer again to India 1 would like to
say that during the first part of my trip I had
the privilege of visiting Israel. I was received
by the Israeli high commissioner and our
ambassador. 1 was very pleased to find that
Senator Croll is so well known in Israel, especially around Tiberias. At Tiberias they are
building a big vocational school, a large
building for 800 pupils, which will bear the
name of Senator Croîl. The opening of this
school will be some time in December. I hope
Senator Croil will be able to see it. At this
Urne there are approximately 100 pupils at
the school, which is stili under construction. I
had my photograph taken with the principal,
who was a very jolly lady. I will give the
picture to Senator Croîl. The sign is not on
the building yet, but it wiil be. It is quite a
tnibute to have the name of Senator Croil, a
member of the Senate of Canada, on a building so far away.
In Tiberias I visited a place where there
is a dining room beside the lake. That is the
place where Christ is supposed to have met
his twelve apostles. It is a kind of summer
resort. There you can see the demolished
structure of the old hot bath of King Solomlon I think I saw the trace of the feet of
Senator Croîl going to have a bath in hot
water. I nientioned to the restaurant keeper
that Senator Croîl was a senator from
Canada, and so on. He had heard about the
school and he was quite pleased that I knew
Senator Croîl. I had a fish called "St. Peter
fish" which. you have to eat when you go to
these places.
My trip to Israel was well worth while. I
spent three days visiting Bethlehem, the old
wall of Jerusalem, the ruins from the days of
King David and King Solomon, and the
Church o! the Nativity. It is difficult to,
explain the tension that exists in Israel at this
moment. I would like to say at this point that
where Israel has been in the hands o! the
Israelis for the last 40 years there has been
tremnendous
development.
When
driving

miles you might think you are in Florida because you see palm and banana trees and
grass growing under irrigation. Al of a sudden you get into the area which has been
occupied by the Arabs and there is nothing
but bare ground. All the roots of the grass
have been chewed up by the donkeys, camels,
and sheep. There is nothing left. When you
go to Bethlehem you have to use Arab guides
because they will not put up with any Israeli
guides in that area, but they are very
friendly.
I was a little bit disappointed in what I
might call the holy spots, because I was
expecting to sec a little more christianity, a
little more religion, not particularly Catholic
nor Protestant. But you stand in front of the
place of the crucifixion, the birthplace of
Christ and the place where Joseph kept Jesus
for about 13 years, and find they have all
been built as beauty spots with tremendous
churches. Most of the ruins have been
destroved. You can stand by a wall about 10
feet high and they tell you that is the original
church built in tie year 300 and destroyed in
the year 1,000. So far as any sign of christianity and holiness is concerned, it just does
not exist. They look like workshops and are
highly commercialized. That is my impression
of Jerusalem, but the trip was well worth
while. I was vcry pleased to know that Senator Croll is so well known in Israel-next time
ho goes I want to go and carry his suitcase.
Coming back to the subject of India, I must
say that I am a novice in external affairs. It is
a subject to which I pay very little attention,
but while we are helping other nations I am
of the opinion that we have also a job to do
here in Canada. We have a plan to expand
our assistance to the various countries in
foreign aid. The people in Canada are concerned about this. I know what the reaction is
at home. Mr. Pearson said last year that we
gave $175 million in foreign aid. We are
thinking now of giving about 1l per cent of
our G.N.P. in the next two or three years,
which amounts to $585 million. The people of
Canada are up in the air about that for more
than one reason. It is because we do not
explain that most of this money is a loan and
it serves a purpose for Canada. I do not
believe that our press is doing the job that it
should do. I do not think we should leave it to
the press; it is up to us to do something about
it. We have all read big headlines on many
occasions saying that $30 million is given to a
certain country, but on many occasions this
money is a loan and it serves the purpose of
buying goods in Canada.

IHon.

Mr. Fournier (Madawaska-Restigouche).]

November 26, 1969

In Ceylon we found locomotives that were
built in Canada and created work in Canada.
There are a lot of situations like that. Unless
we put an effort into explaining to the people
that this money is not just a handout to the
people, that we are getting something in
return, we are going to be in trouble. I can
see myself on a political platform trying to
make a political speech and somebody in the
back of the hall asks about the $45 million
you gave to a certain country. You cannot
answer that, because you have not got the
answer-but this is what will happen. So
when we give this money I think that we
have a duty to explain to the people what we
are doing. For instance, they buy locomotives,
railway equipment, trucks, tractors, building
materials, electrical energy equipment, tur-

bines, generators, high tension cables and
transformers. You can continue the list of
articles that have been manufactured in
Canada and given to some of those countries
who paid for them with the money which
people think we are giving to them. In addition to that, they buy Canadian food products
such as wheat, potatoes and canned goods.
Unfortunately, they also buy war supplies
and war surplus, and we should cut that off
as much as possible. I do not think we will
ever help to supply food to the world by
giving ammunition, tanks and guns.
We must also bear in mind that Canada is
one of the most industrialized countries in the
world, and if we do not have access to these
markets we will be in serious trouble. We can
produce four times as much as we can buy
locally; so much depends on this market and
we must not lose sight of that. On the other
hand, people deserve a better explanation of
foreign aid. Very often they are not given a
truc assessment of the facts.
Countries like India, and even Italy, are
trying to promote employment as much as possible. Here we seem to be trying to promote
a policy of idleness. We pay people to stay at
home and not work. There are all kinds of
ways of drawing money without working.
Perhaps we are going a little too far in that
direction. We do not talk enough about how
to help people earn their living by promoting jobs and paying them fairly good salaries,
enabling them to live at their own expense. In
most cases I have some hesitation about the
vicious road we are taking and spoiling our
people.
We also had a trip to Ceylon, which one
might call the paradise of the world. I note

November 26, 1968

SENATE DEBATES

that the Honourable the Speaker was in
Ceylon in 1952 or 1953, when he made a
memorable trip in India. One thing Canadians
can say about Ceylon is that by our contribution we have made it possible for that country to support itself, to live without any
assistance. With the airport now built they
are selling in the world markets. They are
increasing their tourist activities. They are
producing pineapples, bananas, peanuts,
rubber, cocoa, rice, tea, pepper and sugar
canes. They have become self-supporting
because we made this contribution. The
money spent in Ceylon has been well spent; it
has been a good investment.
When one comes back one appreciates
Canada more than ever, but something on
which I have not made up my mind is the fall
of so-called empires. Many old cities were
once very prosperous and up to date in production and all the means of life. Then one
asks what has happened to them. Something
must have happened. We do not know what it
is. Then we wonder whether it will happen to
us. We have to read back into history. We
know what happened to the empires of the
Turks, the Romans, the Greeks, and the Moslems, and now the British Empire is more or
less declining. What is happening? What did
happen? Will it happen to us?
I believe that here in Canada we are
becoming masters of our own slavery. We
have a monetary system which is fast
approaching its own destruction, I believe; a
system of idleness and promotion against selfsupport. We have revolutions in our society.
There is disregard for authority in religions
and civic organizations. There are heavy
demands on legislatures and strangling taxation. There are even divisions among the
people. We have a high cost of living facing
average incomes; segregation between the
poor and the rich; high cost of production;
disorder and loss of discipline in our educational system. These are only a few factors
that have led me to believe we are walking
on thin ice. Our nation today is nervous and
living in fear and anxiety-fear of atomic
destruction, fear of the collapse of our democratic system, fear of monetary failure. We
live in fear. It may be time to re-assess ourselves and find out where we stand in this
world and try to do something about it as
soon as possible.
On our visit we had an audience with His
Holiness the Pope, which is something one
can never forget. It was a private audience of
only eleven people. We found His Holiness

the Pope to be a very human being. He is
simple and jolly, likes to smile, likes to talk
and to ask questions. He speaks French fiuently, but his English is not so good. We had
been warned that possibly he would speak in
French. He can read English and speaks it
slowly, but he prefers to speak in other languages. Our private audience lasted 20
minutes, and is something pleasant to remember. The Pope read us a speech in French and
English. He knew who we were, where we
had been and where we were going. He
thanked us for appointing an ambassador to
the Vatican, which he said would make him
happy, and I am quite sure it will.
I could tell honourable senators more about
the things I saw, but I will now conclude my
remarks. We have a job to do in selling the
idea of foreign aid to our people. I do not
blame the press for giving us just headlines.
We must tell the people what we do with this
$50 million or $60 million, and what it will
bring to the Canadian people. They want to
hear it and know all about it. We must tell
the people what we are doing to help poor,
starving families.
In India we saw some pitiful sights, particularly in Old Delhi. When you see little children of eight or nine carrying their dead
brothers or sisters, just skeletons and bones,
in their arms, using that as a begging instrument, trying to get a few pennies, it is the
bottom of the barrel. That is what we saw.
There is also a lot of vice there as well as
starvation. You see the children crying and
hitting their bellies, opening their mouths.
You do not dare get out of your car, otherwise they would climb into it and strip it of
everything, because they are hungry, and
they cannot be blamed for that.
What can we do? There are 511 million of
them and the births increase 22 million a
year. We are 21 million total population in
Canada. In India the death rate is about 8
million a year. Believe me, when we give a
dollar to these people it is a dollar well spent.
We have a job to do in selling the idea to the
people; we have to tell the people more about
it so they realize that this is not just a hand
out. A man who has not his belly full with a
meal will blame somebody, especially if his
meal is given away to somebody else.
I thank honourable senators for their
patience in listening to me for this length of
time.

BUSINESS OF THE SENATE
Hon. Leopold Langlois: Honourable senators, I move, with leave, that Order No. 4 be
now brought forward.
Hon. Allister Grosari: Would the Acting
Leader of the Government explain why this
is necessary? This habit of changing the
Order Paper is becoming rather common, and
I think the chamber is at least entitled to
have an explanation of the reasons for doing
so. If, in this case, the Acting Leader of the
Government would proceed in the normal
way he would find that he would not have
problems and would not find it necessary to
move that we set aside our rules without
giving the reason, as required.
Hon. Mr. Langlois: The reason for this
change is that it was anticipated the work on
the agenda this afternoon could not be completed before 5 o'clock, at which time the Committee on Mass Media, an important committee of this Senate, is scheduled to sit. It
seemed desirable that we should try to conclude our work this afternoon before the sitting of the committee, so as not to interfere
with it.

Hon. Mr. Grosari: With respect, Your

why I say we are setting aside our rules. Our
rules require that this be done in a certain

action of the Acting Leader of the Government does not conform to our rules. It is a
point of order on which Your Honour might
wish to rule.
I have raised the point before and I have

requirement that if a rule is to be set aside, it
must be done according to the procedure laid

Hon. Mr. Boebuck: Honourable senators,
with the consent of the Senate, rnay I move
the adoption of these resolutions now.
I arn pleased indeed to have an opportunity
to, lay these resolutions before you. There is a
certain importance in what I have to say in
connection with these particular resolutions.
I would like to caîl the attention of my
fellow senators to the fact that this is an
historic occasion. For one hundred years the
chairmen of the Divorce Committee of the
Senate have been moving, as I amn doing now,
for the passage of messages annulling and
dissolving marriages. I arn moving, on behaîf
of the Standing Comimittee on Divorce, the
adoption 0f these particular resolutions, four
in number, which are now before you. In
addition, there will be three to which I will
speak further. They are withcirawals.
21498-16

The remarkable point about the procedure
wve are following today is that, with the passmng of these four cases, the jurisdiction of
the Senate in the matter of divorces wrnl
have been exhausted. Its duty in the task
which it has performed for the last one hundred years will be ended. I think I arn justified in saying, in consequence, that that is an
historic occasion.
Under such circumstances, I submit that we
should pause for a moment to ponder what
has gone on in the past and to recognize the
contribution of those who have taken part in
these judicial proceedings-those who are
now living and those who are no longer with
us. I arn speaking for my colleagues, not s0 of
myseif.
If I tell you some things you already know,
I hope you will pardon me, as I arn bringing
to conclusion a long series of events.
The British North America Act of 1867 conferred upon the Parliament of Canada jurisdiction in divorce. By Section 129 it was
provided that the laws in force at Confederation should remain in effect until repealed or
altered by the appropriate authority. There
were divorce laws in effect in the provinces,
other than Ontario, Quebec and, later on,
Newfoundland. Objection was taken to the
constitution of divorce courts in these mentioned provinces and consequently individuals
in marital difficulties exercised their traditional right of the citizen to apply to Parliament for relief from the bonds of matrimony.
This was a procedure followed since
Confederation in 1867. Now that the Senate's role is completed with a welter of cases,
it is interesting to recaîl, I suggest, that the
first bill of divorce was passed by the Parliament of Canada in 1868 and that this was the
only case before Parliament in that session.
There were two cases in 1869, three in 1870
and two in 1878. That is to say, there were
eight cases in all, up to 1879.
It may be worth remnembering that in the
flrst ten years after Confederation there were
eight cases only in which divorce was granted
by the Parliament 0f Canada, in very marked
contrast to the number of cases which we
have deait with in the ixnmediate past. In the
first ten years of my chairmanship of the
Senate Divorce Committee, when the committee was hearing evidence and reporting
directly to the Senate, we heard between 300
and 400 cases each session.
In 1963 Parliament passed the Dissolution
and Annulment of Marriages Act, which

SENATE DEBATES
provided for commissioners to hear the evidence and report the findings to the Divorce
Committee. When the Divorce Committee
approved, I moved the resolutions accordingly, as I am doing now.
The act gave Senate resolutions the force of
law, without passage by the Commons or
assent by the Governor General.
On July 2, 1968 the recent Divorce Act
became effective, conferring jurisdiction upon
the Supreme Courts of the provinces and
greatly widening the grounds for divorce. It
also gave to the Senate the obligation to complete those cases which had been commenced
prior to the coming into force of the act in
question.
Honourable senators, I think it is interesting to observe that, from the passing of the
Dissolution and Annulment of Marriages Act
in 1963, to the close of the last session, that is,
to 1968-69, the Senate has granted 3,671 dissolutions and 65 annulments of marriage, a
total of 3,.736 resolutions.
I recall that when the act was passed someone asked me how long it would take to
conclude the efforts of the Senate Committee,
and I answered that offhand I thought it
would take about a year. It was thought that
this was much too long. But little did we
realize then that there were as many as 3,736
people entitled to the passage of a resolution
dissolving their marriage-cases on our files
which had not been completed.
If honourable senators will permit me, tentatively, to add the four cases for dissolution
which I have just presented and am now
moving, this will make a total of 3,675 dissolutions in this last year, together with 65
annulments. In all, that makes 3,740 resolutions which, together with the 252 dismissals
or withdrawals, makes a grand total of petitions dealt with of 3,992-very nearly 4,000
petitions in the course of these last five years.
This is an average of 748 dissolutions and
annulments per session for the last five sessions, or since the coming into force of the
Dissolutions and Annulments of Marriages
Act-that is, the five years during which it
has been in force.
If I may have the consent of the bouse, I
should like to place on record as Appendix A
to this my address, a statement in much
fuller form than merely the leading points
which I have given.

November 26, 1969

(For statement see Appendix A, p. 240.)

Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Thank you. May I pause
here, honourable senators, to pay a well
deserved tribute to the two commissioners
who have served the Senate with such knowledge, skill and industry during these past five
years? I have lived with that operation during
all that time and I know, perhaps as no one
else does, the industry and the attention and
the service which these men have given to us
during that period.
First I should like to mention the admirable
contribution made by Mr. Justice Allison
Walsh, who was our first commissioner, who
organized the court in the first instance and
who settled the jurisprudence under that act,
and of whose devotion, judicial skill and
industry I have had most ample proof. Mr.
Justice Walsh, when he became commissioner
of the Senate, was also appointed a Justice of
the Exchequer Court of Canada and was
given leave of absence for the purpose of
serving as Senate Commissioner. He proved
to be a most capable and devoted judicial
officer, but the number of cases to be heard
were beyond the capacity of any one judge
and so Mr. Justice Cameron, then retired
from the Exchequer Court bench, was
appointed in July 1964 to serve as commissioner. Incidentally, his appointment was on a
time basis, in which capacity and under
which form of payment lie has served up to
the present time.
I must point out that, according to the new
Divorce Act, all persons who had commenced
proceedings at the time that act came into
force, namely, on July 2, 1968, were
given the right to proceed as though that act
had not been passed and, as I have said, we
were given the obligation to hear them and to
dispose of their cases.
The Senate counsel advised us, and I agree
with that advice, that the provisions of the
act applied to all petitioners who had filed at
any time prior to the act's coming into force,
if his case had not been disposed of; and so a
lengthy review of many files thus became
necessary in order that all persons with rights
might be notified to proceed or, in default of
proceeding, that their cases would be dismissed for want of prosecution.
I am advised by Mr. Lemire, the chief clerk
in the commissioners' office, that 6,000 files in
the Senate's possession have been reviewed.
The Hon. the Speaker: Is it agreed, honour- The result has been the 3,740 dissolutions and
annulments and the 252 withdrawals or disable senators?

[Hon. Mr. Roebuck.]

November 26, 1969

Noveber26, 969SENATE
DEBATES

of in the course of that year and the few this
session.
In the spring of 1969, the Chief Justice of
the Exchequer Court requested the release by
the Senate of Mr. Justice Walsh, as he was
urgently required on the Exchequer Court
bench for hearings of important and pressing
cases. The request, Mr. Speaker, in accordance with your wisdom, was granted, and on
January 30, 1969, he was released. Since his
withdrawal the hearings have been carried
on by Mr. Justice Cameron alone; the last
case was heard on June 25, 1969, and the final
report was received by the committee on
October 28, 1969.
Mr. Justice Cameron is prepared to continue in his status as commissioner on a standby lSasis. As he is paid only when engaged
and is retired otherwise, it is wisdom on our
part-and I think co-operation on his-to
have him stand by in the event of, and as a
precaution against, some unforeseen contingency. In that way we will have a judge at
our hand, if we need one.
Now, those facts impel me, honourable
senators, to pay a well deserved tribute to
Mr. Justice Cameron. He has proved himself
to be a most careful, painstaking and meticulous judicial officer. He has a long and rich
judicial experience, a profound knowledge of
Canadian law, a keenly analytical mind and a
compelling sense of the responsibility of his
high office. Mr. Justice Cameron, as sole commissioner, trying a long series of lengthy and
diftlcult cases, has represented us well with
an industry and devotion at times beyond his
normal strength and in disregard of his own
personal welfare. The divorce committee and
the Senate owe to Mr. Justice Cameron a debt
of gratitude.
As to the present situation, we are now
passing the torch to other hands and may
they hold it high. We are stiil greatly interested, for let it not be forgotten that the
Senate played a leading part in bringing
about the present divorce reform, and how
great was the need of that reform is manifested, I suggest, by the fact that during the 12
months from July 2, 1968, when the act became operative, until July 1, 1969-one yearthere were filed in the Supreme Courts of the
ten provinces of Canada as many as 38,116
petitions for dissolution and annulment of
marriage. These 38,116 cases have been dealt
with by 133 courts ti contrast to the 12 courts
that have operated in the past, that is, one
court for each province, and ourselves, frequently with two sub-committees hearing
21498-16 j

cases. These 133 courts have reported to the
Central Registry in Ottawa. There is naturally
a lag in finalizing divorce cases and in issuing
the decree absolute because, as you know,
there is a waiting perîod of three months after
the first decision is made before the decree
may be moved to become absolute. Nevertheless, in that year there have been issued in the
courts of Canada as many as 9,282 decrees
absolute. Ninety-two petitions were dismissed
and 407 were withdrawn. At this stage, however, honourable senators, with your leave I
would like to put on the record as Appendix
B a statement giving in much greater detail
the facts and figures I have just mentioned.
The Hon. the Speaker: Is it agreed, honourable senators?
Hon. Senators: Agreed.
(For statement see Appendix B, p. 241.)
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: While that is an impressive numnher of cases finalized under the new
act, it compares fairly well with those of
previous years. In 1967 there were 11,165
cases, and in 1968 there were 10,291 cases
under the old law with 459 cases under the
new law, making a total of 10,750 ti ail. This
is not very different from what has gone on
in the past except that because of the lag and
the very large number of petitions there will
be a very great hold-over until this year.
May I have your permission, honourable
senators, to file yet another statement giving
in detail the figures for cases that have been
heard in the various provinces?
The Hon. the Speaker: Is it agreed, honourable senators?
Hon. Senators: Agreed.
(For statemnent see Appenclix C, p. 242.)
Han. Mr. Raebuck: We are especiaily interested, of course, in the Provinces of Quebec
and Newfoundland, because the Senate has
been the divorce court for these provinces for
many years. A special effort was made to,
bring the returris for these two provinces up
to date and we find that from July 2, 1968,
until October 24, 1969-the latest report we
have been able to obtain-there were filed in
the Province of Quebec 7,447 cases. The province was divided into two sections, the headquarters of one being in Montreal and the
headquarters of the other being in Quebec
City. The grand total, as I said, was 7,447
cases filed, with 4,229 disposed of, which
shows a very large growth over and above

SENATE DEBATES
the number of cases in the past in the Province of Quebec. There will be carried over
from this past year into the current year as
many as 3,218 cases to be added to the new
cases which no doubt will be filed.
My honourable friend from Newfoundland,
Senator Hollet, will be interested to know
that the figures for that province are not so
large. The number of cases filed in Newfoundland during that period were 228, very
many more than the dozen or so that we used
to try each year. But during the last year
with the new act there were 228 cases, of
which 128 were disposed of, leaving 100 cases
pending to be heard in the present year,
together with such others as may be filed.
While the cases I am moving today will not
be finalized for 30 days and are subject to
appeal in the interval, I feel the work of the
committee and of the Senate in this regard is
now really completed.
According to the new rules, in future matters of divorce will be referred to the Standing Senaie Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs; and it just so happens, though I
think it was not planned, that I have the
honour to be chairman of that committee.
One bill has already been presented and
referred to that committee, and a special subcommittee will be appointed very shortly to
deal with it.
Let me say that procedure is not by way of
appeal. Such a Bill of Divorce, to set aside
the judgment of the previous committee and
the Senate, is heard ab initio, that is to say,
with new evidence. The evidence to be heard
by the trial court which will be constituted
may be quite different from the evidence
upon which the previous committee acted. So,
it is not exactly an appeal; it is a trial de
novo, with new evidence.
So moving the current resolutions is the
final act in the task which the Senate has
discharged with industry, skill and devotion
over the past 100 years.
There have been many chairmen who have
served during that period with distinction
and, I hope, satisfaction to themselves, and
certainly with credit to the Senate. I would
like to point out that my immediate predecessor in this office, in this public service, was
Senator Aseltine.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: I am very happy to see
that he is with us at the moment.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: I am glad to be present,
to hear your final address on the subject.
[Hon. Mr. Roebuck.]

November 26, 1969

Hon. Mr. Roebuck: We are glad to have
Senator Aseltine with us. We two are the
only surviving chairmen who have sat on this
committee, and between us we have carried
this burden for more than a quarter of a
century. To be more accurate, he and I have
been chairmen of this committee for a combined total of 26 years.
Hon. Mr. Croll: There was not much room
for advancement for others!
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Nobody wanted the
advancement, I can assure you.
Hon. Mr. Aseliine: We must have been
irreplaceable.

Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Senator Aseltine ,is a
distinguished past chairman who bas every
right to be proud of his administration during
his period of office; and we are happy in
being proud of him.

As for me, well, I am the final chairman in
bringing this matter to a close today-"the
last of the Mohicans",

I might say. I was

appointed on November 18, 1953, so that on
the 18th of this month I had served for 16
years. And, honourable senators, your continued confidence has been my reward with,
of course-I think I am entitled to this-the
satisfaction that one can draw from the per-

formance of an important and honourable
public
within

years

service. Of course, the work has been
the scope of my own profession, in
I am fortunate in having had many
of experience and training.

Once again, at this time it is appropriate
that I pay credit where credit is due. It has

been due to the faithful work of an excellent
staff, headed by our chief clerk, Mr. Gerard
Lemire, assisted by Mrs. Mary B. Anderson,
the commission secretary, and to a good many
others, including the two commissioners and
all those who have been members of the
Senate Divorce Committee, that in the 16
years in which I have been chairman the
Senate has passed, without exception, every
motion which I have made. Not one single
case in the many thousands we have heard
has been referred back to the committee on
any point of merit in that lengthy period of
16 years.
Now may I have the privilege of putting on
record the "honour roll," shall I say, as we

conclude this work? Let me first mention
those who have gone before us in recent
years: Senators Baird, Barbour, Bradley,
Euler, Farquhar, Gershaw, Golding, Hawkins,
Hnatyshyn, Horner, Howard, Howden, Irvine,

SENATE DEBATES
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: I will tell about that

later on.
The chairman, elected by the committee
itself, as has been the practice ever since, was
Senator McMeans of Winnipeg. Senator White
asked me to give the chairman as much help
as I could. After Senator McMeans the next
chairman was Senator Cliff Robinson, and he
handled the work capably and to my full
satisfaction. I was fairly critical about the
committee, and I insisted that the work be
done in the proper way.
Senator Copp then acted as chairman of the
committee for about a year, after which
Senator Robinson came back again. I followed
in their footsteps until about 1953.
During my time as chairman I was ably
assisted in the work by Senator John T. Haig.
Quite frequently, and particularly after World
War II, we had a great many petitions to deal
with several times a week. I remember that
the committee sat on Mondays, Tuesdays,
Wednesdays, Thursdays, and Fridays, and
sornetimes on Saturdays. When the docket
contained eight, ten, or twelve cases, I would
ask Senator Haig to deal with half of them,
while I took the other half. Three members of
the committee was a quorum, and he would
take a quorum and go into another room and
dispose of half the cases on the docket. He
kept that up, honourable senators, until about
the time I decided to relinquish that position.
I had to give up the chairmanship of the
committee because the number of members
on our side was down to four or five, and I
could not afford to spend the greater part of
ny time dealing with petitions for divorce. I
got in touch with Senator Roebuck. I told him
the reason why I thought I should give up the
position, and asked him if he would be interested in serving as chairman of the committee
if he were chosen. At first he put me off, as
he did on several occasions following that,
and I did not really know what I was going to
do. But finally, after several interviews, I persuaded him that he was the man. He was
chosen as chairman at the first meeting of the
committee, and he proved to be indispensable.
I want to thank him for relieving me and
for the wonderful work that he bas done in
the years since 1953. I did not exactly retire
but allowed my name to remain on the committee for some considerable time. It was not
until the early 1960's after serving about 30
years, that I suggested to our Whip that my
name not be put in the hat, so to speak, and
that I should be relieved from being a
member. During all of that time I was very
much interested in this whole question.
[Hon. Mr. Roebuck.]

November 26. 1969

I will not go fully into the work I attempted
to do, except to say that, as honourable senators probably already know, in 1938 Senator
McMeans and I brought in a bill to enlarge
and reform our laws in connection with
divorce along the lines that were adopted in
Britain by their Matrimonial Act passed in
1938. That bill, after some five or six months,
passed through the Senate and was sent to
the House of Commons. It was so close to
prorogation that it did not get second reading
over there, and died. Then, although it was
our intention at the time to bring in another
bill in 1939, World War II started and we
were very busy until after 1945. Rehabilitation was taking place after that, with the
result that it was not until 1955 that I introduced a similar bill to modify, enlarge and
deal with this very important question of
divorce. That bill did not get very far. There
was a big debate on it, but it did not receive
second reading.
In 1956 I started to attack the question in a
little different way. I had always been in
favour of the abolition of parliamentary
divorce. I wanted to get rid of it at some time
or other if at all possible. This bill of 1956
was a bill to give the Exchequer Court of
Canada full jurisdiction in divorce. If that
had passed, matters would have been about
the same as they are now, except that the
provinces all have their own courts, and the
Exchequer Court, although at first part of the
new arrangement, is practically out of it now.
After 1956 there was a lull. We did not
have any new bills of this nature with respect
to divorce. About 1966 and 1967 a number of
bills were introduced in the other place and
here, which were debated. One of the Senate
bills on which we had extensive debate was
Bill S-19. As a result, and in order to deal
with these bills in the proper manner, a joint
committee of the Senate and House of Commons was set up to deal with divorce. That
comnittee reported in June 1967. I have a
copy of that wonderful report in my hand. I
was a member of that joint committee. After
dealing with all the briefs that were submitted, we attached a draft bill to the report.
That was one joint committee which really got
results.
The other day we were talking about setting up a joint committee on the White Paper
on Tax Reform. I was in favour of such a
committee, partly on account of the fact that
the Joint Committee on Divorce had been so
successful. The report of that joint committee
was received very favourably in both houses,
and the Government brought in Bill C-187 in

November 26, 1969

1967. It was given final reading in December
1967 in the House of Commons and came to
thie Senate. We passed it here after a long
debate and consideration in committee. It was
proclaimed on July 2, 1968.
I do not take any particular credit for the
long time that I spent at this work in the
Senate. The work was flot difflcult for me, as
I had had considerable experience before I
came to Ottawa and I was pleased to do what
1 could. That is why I was interested al
through those years li getting rid of divorce
or, in the alternative, of having our divorce
laws modernized. I neyer did think that I
wouid live long enough ta see that happen,
but now parliamentary divorce bas been abolished, except for the odd petition for a private bill which would, of course, cost qulte a
little bit of money and would not get very
far. I want to thank Senator Roebuck again
for bis kind remarks about me.
I join with ail honourable senators in celebrating the demise of the Standing Senate
Committee on Divorce. However, I sincerely hope that its distinguished chairman and
the distinguished members of that committee
wiil live on for many years, satisfied that
they have done a good job.
Hou. Leopold Langlois: Honourable senators, I cannot let this historic occasion pass

Hon. Mr. Belisie: The speeches made in

been of such a high calibre that everyone
deserves a generous vote of thanks.
As was mentioned the other day by the
Honourable John Connolly, it was my pleasure and privilege to be part of the Canadian
delegation, along with the Honourable Raymond Eudes. The chairman of our Canadian
Branch was the very able and experîenced
Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister, Mr. James E. Wa]ker, M.P. It was a
pleasure to work and travel with him; and
it was an education to listen to his coinments, always grounded in sound common
sense. His fine work of many years in the
O.P.A. has been appreciated by s0 many delegates that hie is known as our outstanding
ambassador.
The part played by Senator Connolly in the
C.P.A. was also of great importance. His wide
knowledge of law and his intelligent approach
to ail the questions that came before the convention brought a clear, logical and rationalistic appraisal and judgment, based on the
facts as he saw them.
AUl members of the Canadian delegation
took part in one or more of the discussions.
They were well briefed, but in order to be of
some assistance during the meetings, we did a
good deal of homework and had practicaily
no leisure time. The briefings given to
Canadian delegates to such international
gatherings are, I believe, factual and useful.

SENATE DEBATES

We were told what our problems are, and
having some familiarity with the problems
of other countries of the Commonwealth
-whether
they are developed countries,
donor countries or developing countries
in the equatorial belt, in the Caribbean, in
Africa or in Southeast Asia-our grasp of the
problems was more readily accomplished.
Permit me to say a word of appreciation of
the kind hospitality that we all received from
our most affable Canadian High Commissioner in Trinidad, the Honourable Gerald Rau
and from Mrs. Rau. He has been there for
only some two months and already he is well
spoken of.
As Senator Connolly has spoken at some
length about the warm and personal hos-pitality of the people, the living accommodations,
the transportation and other tour arrangements as being of the highest order, I will
confine my remarks to other matters.
The leader of the Canadian delegation was
the Honourable John Turner. He led the discussion in the committee dealing with the
problem of "Youth in Revolt"-to which I
was assigned also. May I say that it was the
place of action. Mr. Turner's address not only
electrified the group but left us with an unanswered question of the most crucial importance-are disruptions inimical to university
life?
He made an cloquent plea, as only he can
do when he is relaxed and in full knowledge
of his subject. He spoke for some 26 minutes
and he received the applause of the whole
convention. I would like to summarize what
I believe was his message.
He said that the tradition of the university
as a sanctuary of academic freedom and
centre of informed discussion is an honoured
one to be guarded vigilantly. The basic significance of that sanctuary lies in the protection of intellectual freedom; the right of
professors to teach, of scholars to engage in
the advancement of knowledge, of students to
learn and to express their views free from
external pressures or interference. These
freedoms can flourish only in an atmosphere
of mutual respect, civility and trust among
teachers and students. The result is that
members of the university community are
willing to accept self-restraint and reciprocity
as the condition upon which they share in its
intellectual autonomy. Academic freedom
and the sanctuary of the university campus
extend to al who share these aims and
responsibilities. They cannot be invoked by
those who would subordinate intellectual
[Hon. M. Belisle.]

November 27, 1969

freedom to political ends, or those who violate
the norms of conduct established to protect
that freedom. Against such offenders, the
university has the right and, indeed, the obligation to defend itself. Nor does the sanctuary
of the university protect acts violating civil or
criminal law, which are illegal, whether committed on or off the campus.
Attempts to disrupt or prevent the holding
of classes are a matter of urgent concern to
us. These tactics are fundamentally inimical
to university life. No genuine education can
take place if teachers and students are cast in
adverse roles. Disruptions deny students their
right to an education and scholars their right
to be heard. The claim is false that only by
disruptive tactics can criticism be made effective and university policies changed. In the
past, important
policy and curriculum
changes have been made through faculty and
student action, in which rational discussion
bas been used to find constructive solutions to
problems.
Mr. Turner also said that we recognize the
need for further reforms and hope that ail
Commonwealth members of the university
community will join in the process of orderly
discussion leading to such changes, but we
cannot accept force as a substitute for reasoned argument in deciding matters affecting
the curriculum, instruction and administration
of the university. It is desirable that university discipline be administered through bodies
representative of the academic community,
but this can be effective only if their members accept their responsibility to protect
each other's rights and demonstrate the will
to act. Mr. Turner called upon all members to
defend by example and by action the fundamental principles of a free university. It is
our intention not to surrender the safeguards
of freedom that men have erected at great
sacrifice over several centuries. This summarizes Mr. Turner's thoughts on the subject.
Many other speakers gave us honest and
frank discussions of the current question of
why youth are in revolt. Some thought that
there was a dreadful incongruity between the
universiiy and the state of mind and behaviour of the radical left on the world campus
today. In place of a calm science, we have
people utterly absorbed in the affairs of this
passing world, and instead of these affairs
being discussed with knowledge and without
passion, we find them treated with intense of
passion and a minimum of knowledge.
Instead of resisting excitement, we have a
readiness to react emotionally and at once to

November 27. 1969

Noveber27, 999SENATE
DEBATES

a great variety of issues. In place of selfpossession, we have screaming bouts, street
brawls, clichés and obscenities and virtually
meaningless slogans. It was the consensus that
in this age of technical innovation and the
explosion of knowiedge, neyer has there been
an era when the problems of publie policy
even approached in their complexity those by
which our society is confronted today.
1 arn pleased to mention that the honourable Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, Senator Aird, gave us the opportunity
last spring and summer to study Canada's
relations with the Caribbean countries. A
study of their standard of living prepared us
ini one way to receive more favourably the
recent report prepared by the Right Honourable "Mike" Pearson, with whom I enjoyed
sharing the provincial and federal problems
when he was the federal member for Algoma
East and I the provincial member for Nickel
Beit Riding, which were nearly the same
except that Mr. Pearson had the Manitoulin
Islands and I had the mining communities
surrounding Sudbury.
May 1 say, in passing, that 1 have read
in part the Pearson Report entitled Partners
in Development and I arn in agreement with
it. It is a remarkable document, both for the
wealth of information At provides and for the
persuasive marshalling of its arguments. In
brief, it icalIs for the achievement of the
United Nations' goal of one per cent of developed countries' gross national product for
foreign aid by 1975. Knowing that Canada is
one of the very few donor nations which has
publicly accepted this goal, this was highly
acclaimed by ail countries represented at the
C.P.A. Conference.
Delegates who took part in the commîttee
session agreed that the Commonwealth was
an important organization which had a real
role to play in world affairs, and that the
CPA must contribute more towards fulfllling
the promise of the Commonwealth. The size
of the Commonwealth, embracing some 806
million people, indicates the magnitude of the
role that the Commonwealth should play.
There were, however, many problems within
the Commonwealth which imposed a strain
on its unity. Among such problems were
Britain's faflure to resolve the Rhodesia crisis,
Britain's investment in South Africa, and
racial and economic divisions.
Several delegates paid tribute to Britain's
sense of responsibility in granting independence to s0 many countries in the Commonwealth. Canadian and New Zealand delegates

expressed regret that Britain no longer provided the political leadership which the Commonwealth needed, and they hoped that a
collective leadership would emerge.
A British delegate referred to the development of a climate of opinion in the United
Kingdom which was latently hostile to the
concept of Commonwealth.
One African delegate claimed that certain
African leaders had expressed themselves in
such extreme terms that they had exacerbated the problem of Rhodesia to the disadvantage of Africans there. He stated that no
country in central Africa today could dlaim
with sincerity and authority that she had
severed her trade relations with Rhodesia and
South Africa.
Malawi had consistently rejected the use of
force in Rhodesia. An attack on Rhodesia
would mean an attack on South Africa,
Mozambique and other parts of Africa. War
would mean untold suffering to the mai ority
of Africans in Rhodesia and in the other parts
of Africa which would be involved.
True leadership in Commonwealth and in
African ai! airs must be founded upon honesty
and realism and upon the inspiration of
example rather than upon deception and
hypocrisy. The right approach was to continue the dialogue between Britain and Rhodiesia, to demand that ail African parties in
Rhodesia should form one front and forget
their differences, and to encourage those who
could influence the Africans of Rhodesia to
unite them and promote their political consciousness. Angry words over Rhodesia would
solve nothing. The solution would be found in
peaceful negotiations and persuasion.
One of Canada's priority aid commitments
in the Caribbean is in the field of education,
and we, the Canadian delegates, were proud
to hear so many kind comments on what our
teachers, from. all provinces, are doing to
assist in the training of these people. They
are very conscious that if they are to continue
to progress, their teaching should insist upon
new research being done to absorb and use
scientiflc and technological knowledge.
Honourable senators, whether the long-run
political results will be beneficial is another
and quite different question, and whether the
side effects will strengthen the social fabric is
ikewise in doubt. However, for good or 111,
overwhelming changes are going to occur. We
should think about them if we are concerned
with the welfare of the West Indies, Asia,
Africa and Latin America, and with the relations of their societies with the rest of the
world.

SENATE DEBATES
When I was travelling with a group of
Asian and African colleagues, I asked them
what the whites could do for the development
of their countries. One ventured this reply:
Those least capable of understanding
what is happening in our countries are
the British. Their reaction is more than a
matter of unrequited love. The new formulations of black unity fly in the face of
their liberal dogmas and challenge every
cliche they hold dear. Such a cliche is
"breaking up the Ghetto"; another is the
"colour-blindness" mystique. Still another
is their understanding of inter-racialism
which requires, for instance, that every
house party has, at least, one black guest.
Many whites are even more shattered by
the redefinition of their role or, more
accurately, the rejection of their former
role. The whites have not hated us; they
have loved us. It is the bigots who have
hated us, and hate is a bizarre kind of
flattery. It pays its victims the high compliment of worthiness. But paternalistic
love depreciates them. Hate says to a
man he is an equal, paternalism tells him
he is a child. Despite all protestations to
the contrary, the historie negro-white
alliance, from the abolitionists to the present day, bas been on a paternalistic
basis; we blacks have been junior partners, not equals. But what happens to
paternalism when the child grows up?
I have quoted someone who spoke of the
British. The same could be said of many
other dominating countries.
He tried to explain to me that black people,
especially of the lower economic state, were
hitherto silent, pliant and largely invisible.
But now they have found their voice. They
are bursting with existence and are no longer
willing to have their whole lives ordered by
others. They insist upon making for themselves the decisions which determine their
lives. They will make mistakes, but they must
be their own mistakes, their own blunders.
Free a man and he is not yet free. He must
still free himself. This he viewed as a positive
development toward participatory democracy.
Help and co-operation, he argued, must be
given on those terms, or not at all. The worst
result of the nation's racism is that even
black people think of themselves as inferior.
It has stunted their growth. A child does not
mature as long as he plays the role of a child.
When he reaches adulthood, it is good that he
leaves the household and rejects the parent if
the parent does not begin to view him as an
adult. Asian and African people have now
[Hon. Mr. Belisle.]

Novernber 27, 1969

grown up in their self-image and they have
walked out of the bouse.
To regain relevance in the struggle of these
people, we of the west must reorient our feelings and thinking. We must get over seeing
ourselves as great white fathers and mothers,
brokers of power and patrons of these people.
We must learn that if, in the missionary way,
we stoop down to offer the hand of friendship, the offer will be rejected, the hand
bitten. If we offer it laterally, it will be circled warily, eyed suspiciously, then perhaps
taken gingerly and tentatively.
After listening to many speeches, some of
them very interesting, delivered to us with
serious and obviously good knowledge of
their subject, some given only with passion
and biased opinions, I am convinced that the
future of the Commonwealth Parliamentary
Association rests on whether we realistically
understand them because, if we do not, no
amount of debating will bring us cohesiveness. The result can only be dispersion. The
obsolescence of the ascendancy of one camp
or the other will be determined ultimately,
not by rhetoric, and not even by leadership,
as much as by events.
Events today seem to be pointing to a spirited new force-cohesion-and I think, at this
historical juncture, that these events are right
and good for all men and especially for those
who have not yet fully enjoyed their freedom
as man.
White men must learn to work with all
mon as equal, or else they will be written off
by the inevitable march of time.
Hon. Paul Martin: Honourable senators, we
are indebted to Senator Connolly (Ottawa
West) for raising this question. Today, of
course, we are grateful to Senator Belisle for
reminding us of the important conference
which he, Senator Connolly (Ottawa West)
and others attended. The Senate, in my opinion, bas established a useful practice in seeing
to it that delegates who attend conferences
of the Inter-Parliamentary Union, meetings
of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association, and meetings of NATO parliamentarians
report to this bouse.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Martin: We had a good example
of this yesterday, when Senator Carter took
the initiative to report on the recent meeting
in New Delhi of the Inter-Parliamentary
Union which he, Senator Langlois and Senator Fournier (Madawaska-Restigouche) attended. This discussion is one upon which

They are children basically of good quality.
They come from our homes; they share with

advice of a wise university president who
recognized that it is in understanding and in
tolerance, in firmness exercised in the right
particulars, that we are likely to find a solution of this question.
Senator Belisle mentioned also the problems of the underdeveloped world. The fact is
that of the populations of the world, 75 per
cent of the people are in this category. Many
of them come from Commonwealth countries
in the Caribbean, in Africa and in Asia. They
come too, from some of the longer established
sovereign states of the Commonwealth: India,
the second most populous country in the
world, Pakistan, Ceylon, Singapore and
Malaysia. It is therefore natural that as a
Commonwealth country we should have a
deep
interest
in
the
problems
of
underdevelopment.
It is significant that our first foray into the
field of external aid came through our desire,
along with other Commonwealth donor countries, to do something for some of the underdeveloped nations of the Commonwealth.
Hence was born the Colombo Plan, in which
the United States with its great wealth and
resources was given the opportunity to associate with Commonwealth donor countries in
trying to meet the problems that face the
underdeveloped countries of the Commonwealth and of the world.
It is a matter of pride, as Senator Belisle
underlined, that a former Canadian Prime
Minister, Mr. Pearson, should have been
selected by the World Bank to examine this
problem. This was done not only in its Commonwealth context, but in the context of the
need to provide the underdeveloped countries
of the world generally with a better opportunity to raise their standard of living, take
their part in the growing affluence of the
modern world. The recommendations which
Mr. Pearson and his fellow commissioners
have made will receive examination by the
Government of Canada, by other governments
and by the World Bank, all designed to meet
what undoubtedly is one of the challenging
problems of our time and one from which
[Hon. Mr. Martin.]

November 27, 1969

neither we in the Commonwealth nor those
outside it can escape.
It will not be easy merely by grants in
aid, the pattern of the Canadian contribution, to solve the problem in the Commonwealth or outside it. The fact is that after
nineteen years of foreign aid effort the gap
between the underdeveloped and the developed countries is greater than when the
first collective act of assistance was established. It may be that we will have to find
supplementary methods to raise the standard
of living, to raise the productive processes of
the underdeveloped world and to enable it to
share in the development of the world's more
affluent economic life. Perhaps in some way,
as Mr. Ball, a former Under-Secretary of the
United States State Department, said, we will
have to act not only through the preferential
tariff system and other concessions in trade,
but through some mechanism, to export the
technological know-how of the western world
to these countries. Perhaps we will have to
give an injection to the African nations and
the nations of Asia and the Caribbean of the
kind of impetus given by President Truman
and General Marshall at the end of the
Second World War, which led to the economic
resurgence of Europe. The Commonwealth
will mean more and will have an enriching
quality if these objectives are reached.
I said earlier that it was not an easy organization to define. One aspect that it has in
common is the existence of what we know as
the parliamentary system. The parliamentary
system, as we have been reminded frequently-particularly when the speakers of the
Commonwealth Parliaments deliberated in
this very room last summer-is one of the
guarantors of the maintenance of a free society. It is a system which is sometimes taken
for granted at a time when the news media
have acquired an almost pre-emptive place in
the dialogue between the people and those
who comment on public affairs, but who are
not themselves members of the parliamentary
system.
Senator Belisle spoke of the views
expressed by the delegate from Malawi with
regard to the problem of Rhodesia. The fact is
that most governments of the Commonwealth
had strong views on the decision of Mr.
Smith to embark on a program known as a
unilateral declaration of independence. It was
felt that meant the perpetuation of the discrimination practised by the government in
that country contrary to the Charter of
Human Rights and the provisions of the

November 27, 1969

SENATE DEBATES

Charter of the United Nations. It was practically a unanimous prime ministers' conference that indicated that it would not accept
such a unilateral declaration. The Commonwealth was basically united in its condemnation of discrimination against the blacks in
that country. It was following this that we
had first of all the voluntary sanctions of
the Security Council, lived up to by Canada,
and finally the mandatory sanctions of the
Security Council, again observed by Canada,
imposing embargoes both ways against that
country. As well, we removed our diplomatic
presence from Salisbury.
It was the same resistance to the discrimination practised in Rhodesia that caused most
of the Commonwealth countries five years ago
to join in the United Nations in a condemnation against a former Commonwealth country,
South Africa. It seems to me that if those of
us in the Commonwealth who are white had
not thus acted, if we were not determined to
do all we could to witness nondiscrimination
as prescribed by the Charter of the United
Nations, we would not be serving the cause of
the Commonwealth, nor would we be serving
the purposes which underlie the Charter of
the United Nations, to which we affixed our
signature in April, 1945 in San Francisco.
The Commonwealth, like many other institutions of our time, is the subject of examination and in some areas the object of
dissent. I for one believe strongly that in the
interdependent world in which we live, an
interdependence that has been brought home
to us by the achievement of the astronauts,
by those who first set foot on the moon, we
have to move towards a healthy form of
internationalism, an internationalism not in
contradiction to national integrity and national aspiration. The world is too big to think
that it could be unitary, but undoubtedly if
we are to have peace in the world there have
to be restraints on nations as restraints are
placed on individuals in the domestic
community.
I strongly support the continued maintenance of the Commonwealth. I am sure most
Canadians do, because we recognize in it, in
this organization of sovereign states, a valuable contribution to international collaboration
and to the kind of world community under
law which we wish to see built. Canada has
made its contribution, as have other countries
in the Commonwealth.
We have now a Commonwealth organization directed by a Canadian, one of our distinguished foreign service officers, Mr. Arnold
Smith. The organization he heads is not the

organism that Sir Wilfrid Laurier and Sir
Robert Borden opposed. It is not an effort
at giving to the Commonwealth a particular structural base, to which most of these
former Prime Ministers objected. It is rather
a mechanism for enabling the assistance to
be given to the underdeveloped countries, an
organism designed to promote acts of coordination within the realm of practical
achievement.
So, honourable senators, as the Leader of
the Government today, I felt I should
express these views about the Commonwealth,
views which are shared by my colleagues in
the Government, views that I believe are shared by the great majority of people in our
country. In no way does our own nationalism
become abridged because of our recognition
that here we are given the opportunity for
true international co-operation; and in our
case giving us contact not only with Europe
through Britain, but through Australia and
New Zealand contact in Australasia, and with
that part of Asia from which Ceylon, Pakistan and India come, and likewise contact with
the new, emerging continent of Africa, with
which we would have no contact, no great
knowledge, were it not for the fact that we
share with these countries of the Commonwealth in Africa a common base-a common
base that because of our bilingual character, as I said, has given us these additional
contacts with the Francophone countries of
Africa. I had the pleasure and responsibility
of visiting the Francophone countries last
November on behalf of the Government in
connection with certain international conferences which were about to take place in
Africa, and in connection with which the
Government of Canada felt there should be a
Canadian presence.
The Commonwealth captures our intelligent
and civilized support. We recognize in it,
through the Commonwealth Parliamentary
Association, through other means of contact
with parliamentarians all over the Commonwealth, an organism that can play a useful
part for the people who belong to it, but more
particularly for the kind of contribution they
can make to the effort that men and women
all over the world today, with their governments, are making in seeking to guarantee
foundations for a more peaceful world.

DOCUMENTS TABLED

The three other questions are as follows:
2. Why was there not; enough flax at
the Lakehead to 611I comxnitmnents for
Canadian flax, the 1969 fiax crop being
over 30 million bushels?
3. Who was responsible for the shortage-the railways, the grain trade, the
Wheat Board trade?
4. And, if none of them, who was
responsible?

Certainly, the Leader of the Cloverniment ln
the Senate was flot responsible. The answer
to those questions is as follows.
Flax exports last year were 13.4 million
bushels, and there were below normal supplies of old fiaxseed left on farms and in
country elevators at the end of the crop year.
As a resuit, the possibility of new business for
shipment in the early months of this crop
year depended on new crop supplies. Unfortunately, harvesting was late in many areas.
Realizing this, the Wheat Board worked very
closely with a committee of responsible members of the grain trade to maximize the
movement and sale of Canadian fiax. The
Board established a 5 bushel per seeded acre
quota at the beginning of the crop year. This
bas since been increased to 8 bushels. As at
October 22, fiax deliveries to country elevators in the current crop year were 4.3 million
bushels, with stocks of 2 million bushels on
band in country elevators. This compares
with deliveries of 1.4 million bushels during
the samie period a year ago and stocks in the
country elevators on a corresponding date a
year earlier of 1.5 million bushels. The Board
bas granted shipping orders promptly and has

SENATE DEBATES
to be postponed for a week so that I could
participate in the debate. Secondly, I wish to
thank my own leader for asking me to speak
to this legislation, and Senator John Macdonald for his kind remarks.
I have gone over this bill thoroughly and
read the pertinent and well-thought-out comments of the sponsor of the bill, Senator
Smith. He, as a member of the dental profession, has undertaken to make himself thoroughly acquainted with the prerequisites of
this new piece of government legislation
which, with some exceptions, I fully endorse.
It is readily discernible, by reading the sponsor's comments, that he has been more than
adequately briefed by the officials in the
department.
I must say that I am in complete agreement
with the remarks made by two distinguished
members of the Senate, Senator Lazarus Phillips and Senator Grattan O'Leary, in their
pregnant and yet important description of
these gentlemen who very often give so-called
expert evidence before the committees of the
Senate. That was aptly demonstrated in the
Food and Drug bill which, by careful reasoning and suggestions, was modified by the
Banking and Commerce Committee, as were
other picces of legislation, under the distinguished chairmanship of Senator Hayden.
This reminds me of a good definition given
for an efficiency expert: He is one who is
smart enough to tell you how to run your
business and too smart to start one of his
own.
Now to get down to the meat of this bill. It
is a long-overdue piece of legislation, but this
I can readily understand, because with the
Parkinsonian Law in effect in government it
is very difficult to do all things at one time.
To say that I agree with all that the sponsor
has analyzed and proposed for the Government is just not true. I propose to make a few
comments as a medical man. It is the medical
profession, as you know, that has to do with
quarantine in all its aspects.
There are three ways of chronicling legislation. It can be described academically; it can
be narrated novelistically; it can be interpreted scientifically. The term "science" is
derived from the Latin scire, meaning "to
know, to understand" and, as such, it embodies a concept of an ordered knowledge of
nature and of man. This legislation certainly
has a scientific aspect to it.
I should like to give you a definition of
science. Science may be defined by us as an
active, progressive, cumulative and dynamic
[Hon. Mr. Sulivan.]

December 2, I969

process of acquisition of knowledge about
man and nature. One has two ways of
expressing oneself-through art and through
science. Art is an individual manifestation; it
is the "I" expressing, individually, its own
emotions. Science is a collective manifestation: the "we" pooling its rational knowledge
and trying to accomplish something according
to a method or system.
I assure honourable senators that my discussion will be entirely constructive. I shall
keep my remarks brief and to the subject,
and capable of being scientifically substantiated; otherwise, I would not make them.
At this point I wish to re-emphasize a statement made by the sponsor of the bill as it
appears in the Debates of the Senate of
November 20, 1969, at page 189:
In designing the present bill, note has
been taken of the fact that the Quarantine Act, to be repealed by this bill, consists almost entirely of regulation-making
sections. Care has been taken to include
in the basic legislation itself in the new

draft every possible provision for the
implementation of the measure, leaving
to subordinate legislationAnd I underline those words.
-in the form of regulations, only the
remaining minimum which upon consid-

eration is deemed essential.
There is some question in my mind concerning the use of the phrase "subordinate
legislation". It should be spelled out in the
bill, as I shall show. This very statement I
have just read postulates in itself a great
improvement over previous legislation.
In his discussion of the bill, Senator Choquette asked the sponsor a very important
question with regard to the method of transference or communication of infection by
other than human beings. In his reply, the
sponsor used the word "things" and stated
that there was a legal meaning to that word. 1
should prefer to give it its medical meaning
and the reason for it; and that, I propose to
do shortly.
Senator Thompson asked the sponsor a
question pertaining to tuberculosis, to which
he replied, quite correctly, that this particular
aspect is not part of this legislation but comes
under the authority of the Immigration Act.
However, the question is important because it
was most ably answered by Senator Roebuck.
But I should enter a word of caution here:
when a person has had tuberculosis and
appears clinically cured, he is, nevertheless,

December 2, 1969

SENATE DEBATES

always suspect. That should be recorded and
understood completely.
I personally have seen and have had
numerous cases treated with the drug Streptomycin, who have been categorized as clinically cured of lung tuberculosis and who have
had chronically discharging tuberculous
middle ears, a bone disease which was not
detected-a most difficult observation and
diagnosis for the average clinician, let alone a
quarantine officer. In many of these cases the
people are completely deaf; nevertheless, they
get into this country. What are we to do with
them? We have to take care of them. We are
not going to write to the Immigration Department and ask to have them sent home. This
is occurring frequently. How we are going to
counteract it is a problem. And, honourable
senators, we just do not have the medical
personnel in this country to do the job that
we would like to do. It is all we can do to
take care of our own citizens. This fact has
been verified by the Dean of Medicine of the
University of British Columbia, Dr. John F.
McCreary, as reported in The Canadian
Doctor, 1969, page 14. I am quite sure that
Senator Kinley will accept that remark, a
member of his immediate family being a distinguished member of the medical profession.
I turn next to mental disease. This is a
problem within itself, and I am not nearly as
optimistic as the sponsor of the bill that in
committee we will get the answers to which
he alluded in his remarks. I can assure him
that we will certainly not get the answer
from sociologists, psychologists or psychiatrists. We might get a reasonable answer from
two neuropsychiatrists
regarding mental
disease.
I would here remind honourable senators of
the attempt to define "mental disease" in the
changes to the Criminal Code, particularly
those sections relating to abortion.
I should like now to refer to page 3 of the
bill, section 7(1). Here I would suggest that
the word "insect" be substituted for "vermin"
at line 3. "Vermin" has a different connotation. "Insect" has a broader definition, including mosquitoes, such as might be brought into
this country aboard aircraft; mosquitoes
which might also be carrying the causative
agent of diseases such as dengue fever from
Puerto Rico, where it is epidemic at the present time.
The same section makes reference to "carriers of an infectious or contagious disease."
It would be more correct to say "carriers of
causative agents of infectious or contagious

disease," since insects do not carry the disease
but do carry the causative agent. This is also
true in the case of birds, such as parrots,
which carry the causative agent. People carry
them on airplanes or put them in luggage
compartments, and frequently they carry the
causative agent which produces the disease
known as psittacosis. In certain countries it is
much more common than is generally realized. As a matter of fact, last summer in the
lake area I go to, there was a visitor from
Mexico who had this infection. At first it was
thought to be mononucleosis, but he did not
know this. This parasite can be detected in
the bloodstream, and many birds imported
into this country are so infected.
I refer honourable senators to page 5, subsection 2, paragraph (f). This is perhaps
academic, but it seems to me that the conjunction "or" is required between subparagraphs (i) and (i). It would then read as
follows:
-shall not be longer than the incubation
period prescribed for that disease, or
(ii) he submits to being vaccinated
against that disease.
I refer next to page 6, section 10, line 4.
There again, it seems to me it would be well
to have it read: ".. .carriers of the causative
agent of an infectious or contagious disease."
The most important part of the legislation appears on page 9 in section 19, subsection (1), paragraph (g). At the present
time there is considerable discussion in the
United States, and to some extent in Canada,
as to the advisability of deleting the recommendation of primary vaccination against
smallpox in infants and children because of
the very low incidence of this disease in the
western hemisphere. The argument pertaining
to this discussion was recently presented at a
meeting of an independent group studying
smallpox vaccination of imported cases into
the United States and Canada, the American
Public Health Association, Philadelphia,
November 10-12, 1969. This scientific information is so recent that the very essence of what
I am about to state and the papers presented
at this meeting in Philadelphia are being published in the New England Journal of Medicine, November 30, 1969.
In view of the fact that more people die in
Canada from smallpox vaccination than from
the disease smallpox, every precaution should
be taken not to vaccinate any person wherein
there are definite contra-indications. With the
advent of the great drug armamentarium and
with people taking all kinds of drugs today,
its importance becomes evident. Besides ecze-

SENATE DEBATES
ma, which is one of the outstanding contraindications, the use of various agents such as
steroids and alkylating drugs-Alka-Seltzer
and things of that nature-makes caution
necessary in the employment of vaccination.
Hon. Mr. Martin: Would there be occasions
when Alka-Seltzer would be an appropriate
medication?
Hon. Mr. Sullivan: Its continuous use will
alkalize the system and render one liable to
react to the injection of the vaccine. I am not
trying to frighten certain persons whom I saw
taking Alka-Seltzer last night, but, at the
same time, I think they should be cautious.
I would suggest adding the following to the
latter part of paragraph (g) of Section 19(1):
That persons with eczema or diseases
such as leukemia, lymphoma, or generalized malignancy or those who may have
lowered resistance such as from therapy
with steroids, ...

-such
as the cortizone drug which many
people use now for rheumatoid arthritis... alkylating

drugs,

antimetabolites

or

radiation, ...
-as

in radiation of the glandular systemor during pregnancy in which immunization is deemed to be contra-indicated, be
exempted from this section at the discretion of the quarantine officer.

And lie should be a medical man.
This suggestion is substantiated in another
way by The World Health Organization,
Geneva, 1966, International Sanitary Regulations, Article 98, footnote 9, which reads as
follows:
If a vaccinator is of the opinion that
vaccination is contra-indicated on medical
grounds he should provide the person
with written reasons underlying that
opinion, which health authorities may
take into account.
Let me clarify my position on what might
be some misunderstanding regarding these
thoughts on smallpox vaccination and the
reasons just given for changing section 19(1),
paragraph (g).
There is no question about the efficacy of
smallpox vaccination. It is an extremely effective procedure and, if carried out in the
proper fashion and with potent vaccine, it
will undoubtedly control and effectively
eradicate smallpox from the world.
[Hon. Mr. Sullivan.]

December 2, 1969

The advisability or otherwise of continuing
smallpox vaccination of infants and children
in Canada and the United States is under
discussion, but it is the authoritative opinion
of Dr. Milton H. Brown, Fellow of the Royal
College of Physicians, Emeritus Professor
of Hygiene and Communicable Diseases,
School of Medicine, University of Toronto,
and one of the outstanding authorities in
America in this particular field, that there is
no question but that smallpox vaccination
(primary) should be continued in infants and
children in Canada until there is sufficient
further experience to warrant its cessation.
The reasons suggested for the changes in
paragraph (g) of section 19(1) can be amplified by pointing out the contra-indications,
and since there has been no smallpox in
Canada or the United States in the last few
years, except an imported case from South
America in 1962, every endeavour should be
made to prevent the unnecessary complications of this procedure by not carrying it out
in the groups which were outlined in my
previous remarks. The bill should specify
those persons, namely, those who are suffering from certain diseases, and those receiving
antimetabolites, et cetera. Most of the complications of smallpox vaccine have occurred
in persons with eczema or those suffering
from other contra-indications. Another reason
for spelling out in detail the contra-indications is that the act does not state that the
quarantine officer will be a medical doctor; in
fact, it permits a customs officer to play the
role of a quarantine officer in certain
circumstances.
In the most recent recommendations
regarding immunization by the Public Health
Service Advisory Committee on Immunization
Practices, United States Department of
Health, Education and Welfare-which just
came to an end in November of this yearthe same precautions are advised for all live
vaccines, that is, live poliomyelitis, measles,
mumps, rubella, and yellow fever vaccines.
So, what has been said about smallpox
applies to all those live vaccines.
I wish to illustrate by means of a hypothetical case the following practical problem.
We might, for example, have a plane arriving
from Central Europe with immigrants, and it
is determined upon its arrival that there is a
case of smallpox on board. If the plane arrives in Montreal, there is available a semiisolation hospital at the Pasteur Institute.
However, should it arrive in Toronto, there
is no isolation hospital available. Is this a
provincial matter or is it a federal matter?

December 2, 1969

Deoemer 2,1969SENATE
DEBATES

If the health of the province is a provincial
matter-and knowing that I arn a doctor you
can read what I arn thinkmng between the
lines-then I should tell the Minister of
Heaith: "So is medicare." We might-and I
emphasize "might"-get that point clarified in
committee.
Hon. Mr. Martin: Did I understand the
honourable senator to say that in Toronto
there is no isolation hospital?
Hon. Mr. Sullivan: It has been removed. If
there was a case of smallpox in Toronto we
would have to take it to one of the major
hospitals, and isolate almost a whole ward, to
put the patient in isolation. The isolation hospital in Riverdale should flot have been
removed. But in Montreal the Pasteur Institute handies these cases. This is a problem
that can confront the country, having regard
to the state of air travel today.
In closing, honourable senators, I highly
commend this legisiation to you. The recommendations I have suggested are medically
and scientifically sound and up to date, and I
trust that in committee I wfil fot be confronted by some individual from the department
telling me that ail of this is in the regulations.
Before resuming my seat I shouid like to
bring to the attention of ail honourable senators this excellent novel concerning quarantine, which is particularly appropriate with
the Apollo astronauts li the city today as our
guests. It is entitled The Andromeda Strain,
and is by Michael Crichton. It is the story of
a lethal infectious disease that is transmitted
from the moon to the earth, and is well worth
reading.,
Hon. John J. Connolly: Could fixe honourabie sponsor of this bill (Hon. Mr. Sm.ith) tel
us, whether the regulations and the law in
respect of the matter that Senator Sullivan
has discussed so knowledgeably this afternoon
are comparable in the United States and
Canada? If he cannot answer that question,
perhaps it can be deait with in committee.
1 should like to take this occasion to point
out the invaluable contribution made by men
who are eminent in their profession. This is
an admirable forum for the type of speech we
have just heard.
1 was particularly interested in what Senator Sullivan had to say in view of thxe great
amount of air travel today, the diversification
of routes, and the arrivai in Canada from distant places, and indeed li America generally,
of people who may very well be carriers
21498-17

perhaps of the disease or the bases upon
which the disease can be communicated.
Hon. Mr. Sullivan: The causative agents.
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): Yes, the
causative agents. I remember many years ago
travelling to Jamaica on business without
having been vaccinated.
Hon. Mr. Martin: On business?
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): Yes, on
business. I camne back through Miamni, where I
was vaccinated, almost by force. It was a
requirement of the U.S. Immigration that I be
vaccinated before I be allowed to proceed on
my way in an American plane to New York,
and thence to Canada. Air Canada did flot fiy
there at that time. The person who vaccinated
me had done it many times before, I arn sure,
but he was no medical doctor. I neyer had
such a reaction li my life.
Hon. Mr. Sullivan: It was like being in the
army?
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): I neyer
had the experience of an armny vaccination,
but on that occasion I had a swellîng on my
arm the size of an egg for about ten days. I
was glad that it was in the suminer, and it
did not have to be covered up. The sun
looked after it.
It is important that medical people do this
in Canada. It is important too that there
should be uniform standards o! practice in
countries adjacent to Canada. I hope that the
subjects will be discussed in an appropriate
committee.
Hon. Mr. Sullivan: Would Senator Connolly
please repeat the first part of his question? I
did not hear it.
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): The
question was asked of the sponsor o! the bill,
and it is a matter that hie can deal with in
committee.
Hon. Arthur W. Roebuck: I should like to
ask a question of the hxonourable Senator Sullivan. I listened to his speech as carefully as

are very few cases now in England, the time
bas come when a traveller leaving Canada
might very well be allowed to use his own
good judgment in the matter of vaccination.
I have travelled to England on a number of
occasions. If I have not been vaccinated
within three years of the time of departure it
is necessary to receive another vaccination. I
was thoroughly sick in England as a result of
one vaccination I received. It occurs to me
that, even conceding everything that is claimed with regard to the usage and virtue of
vaccination, the time has come now to rely
on good health, rather than making a great
many people sick when it is perhaps unnecessary. Are we not approaching the time when
we could travel between here and England or
France, or some other countries, without this
indiscriminate requirement that everyone be
vaccinated whether be wants it or not?

Senator Roebuck. Leading authorities in this

Hon. Mr. Roebuck: I am very pleased
indeed with what the honourable senator has
told us with regard to vaccination and the

SENATE DEBATES

it was my definite understanding that this
new act spells out in the legislation the
powers which previously had been, for the
most part, given to the people who enforce
this act and who operate it, in the form of
regulations. Therefore, by spelling it out it
satisfied what I believe has come to be a
common criticism of the Depariment of Justice and perhaps other Government departments involved. In that respect it was an
improvement. As a former member of the
dental profession I might also say that I, of
course, defer to Senator Sullivan as one with
knowledge in very many fields. Much of our
legislation would not be explained in Parliament and would not, of course, be administered if we required those who have specialized knowledge in the medical profession to
explain the legislation or put it into effect. It
is quite a number of years since a member of
the medical profession has been Minister of
National Health and Welfare in this country.
This fact applies to most of the provinces. He
also raised some interesting points which our
response made evident were of interest to us
all. These are all points that can easily be
discussed when the bill is brought before the
committee. I think the honourable senator
will agree with me, as perhaps all of us will
agree, that we are very fortunate in this
country, both at the federal level and at the
provincial level, in the type of people who are
available these days to take positions in the
public service. I have more particular knowledge of those who serve in the Department
of National Health and Welfare in this country than in others. They do not take second
place to anybody in this country in their
knowledge of and dedication to the job which
they are called upon to carry out. I think that
will be exemplified to a very high degree indeed when this bill is referred to the Standing
Senate Committee on Health, Welfare and
Science, which I understand is the appropriate committee. If the bill is given second
reading I will make such a motion.
Motion agreed to and bill read second time.

Hon. Donald Snith moved that the bill be

CUSTOMS TARIFF AND EXCISE TAX ACT
BILL TO AMEND-SECOND

READING

Hon. Salter A. Hayden moved the second
reading of Bill C-140, to amend the Customs
Tariff and to make a consequential amendment to the Excise Tax Act.
He said: Honourable senators, this bil
implements the final tariff rates agreed to in
the Kennedy Tariff Round, and also provides
for a number of other tariff changes, in the
main based on recommendations by the Tariff
Board. There are in addition certain items
dealing with procedures.
Before explaining the purposes of the bill, I
should like to direct honourable senators'
attention to the fact that there was distributed earlier today in the Senate a statement
showing the present rates of duty in force in
relation to goods or tariff items that are the
subject matter of this bill. There is also set
out in the statement on a comparative basis
the rates proposed under this bill So that a
comparison can readily be made between
existing rates and the proposed rates. In the
other place this type of material, not having
been printed in the bill itself, was on motion
included in the Votes and Proceedings of the
day. I should like to make a similar motion
today, wi.h leave of the Senate, that this
statement be printed as part of the Minutes
of Proceedings of the Senate this day, so that
honourable senators will have this readily
available for comparative purposes.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, is it agreed that this document be
appended to our Minutes of Proceedings?
Hon. Senators: Agreed.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: Honourable senators, I
should first like to refer to clauses 5, 6 and 7
of the bill. These three clauses implement
reports made by the Tariff Board, and the
schedules referable to the tariff items affected
by these reports are found in Schedules A, B
and C of this bill.
I should comment that I am one of those
old-fashioned persons who may sound somewhat strange saying "skedule," in which I
have persisted notwithstanding the pressure I
have been subjected to from time to time to
say "shedule." Somehow or other the hard
sound comes out.
Hon. Mr. Martin: It is your Ottawa Valleybirth.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: It must be. It is a burden
that I find easy to carry, and which one car-

SENATE DEBATES
ries much easier than some of the inflections
that proceed from other areas of Canada.
Schedule A implements the report of the
Tariff Board on machinery, apparatus, printing plates and related products for the printing and allied industries. This reference, No.
133, was tabled in the other place on December 21, 1966, and it extends the duty-free
entry for typecasting and typesetting equipment. I should refer honourable senators to
the major recommendations of the Tariff
Board on this reference. They are the
following:
(1) Removal of the 10 per cent MostFavoured-Nation tariff on large printing
presses; new tariff item 41201-1. This reduction was for the most part implemented by
order in council on July 1, 1968, to give effect
to our Kennedy Round undertaking in respect
of printing presses.
(2) Removal of the duty on a wide range of
typecasting and typesetting equipment; tariff
item 41215-1.
(3) Expansion of the duty-free item covering machinery and apparatus used by commercial printers and paper converters; tariff
item 41205-1.
(4) Consolidation and simplification of the
numerous tariff items covering printing
plates; tariff items 41230-1 to 41245-1.
(5) A new tariff item for press blankets or
blanketing; tariff item 53417-1.
(6) A new tariff item for equipment used in
the production of manifold business forms;
tariff item 41210-1.
Some of these Tariff Board recommendations called for increases in the rates of duty
which were bound against increase under
GATT; this necessitated some re-negotiation in order to free or reduce the rates on
these items, and this bas been completed.
Honourable senators may want to know to
what extent the tariff items contained in
Schedule A depart from, or the extent to
which they support, the recommendation of
the Tariff Board. The departures are few, and
are these:
(1) Retention of the present rates of free
British Preference and 5 per cent MostFavoured-Nation on press blankets or blanketing of a class or kind not made in Canada;
tariff item 53415-1. The Board recommended
rates of 10 per cent British Preference and 15
for all
per cent Most-Favoured-Nation
press blankets. In the new schedule these
rates will be applied only to blankets or blan[Hon. Mr. Hayden.]

December 2, 1969

keting of a class or kind made in Canada;
tariff item 53417-1.
(2) Rewording of the proposed new item
41210-1 for business forms production equipment. The wording recommended by the
Tariff Board for this item was broader than
the range of such equipment which is made
in Canada.
(3) Provision for the free duty entry of
anti-offset spraying equipment; tariff item
41205-1.
(4) A less restrictive end-use provision than
recommended by the Tariff Board for item
34615-1, which will provide for continued
duty-free entry of zinc sheets to be prepared
for use in photo-engraving.
(5) An amendment to the end-use provision
of tariff item 42605-1, which was not included
in the Tariff Board reference, to bring the
item in line with item 41205-1.
Those are all the comments I have to make
in connection with the first Tariff Board reference, which is implemented to the extent I
have indicated. I have also indicated the
departures from the recommendations of the
Tariff Board.
Clause 6 deals with a new set of rates,
replacing certain existing rates. These new
rates are set out in Schedule B to the bill.
This schedule implements the Tariff Board
recommendation on reference 138. This reference had to do with precision instruments
and apparatus, such as engineering, surveying, prospecting, drafting and metal working.
There are some rate reductions, but mainly
the language in the tariff items has been considerably modernized.
Clause 7 of the bill also implements the
recommendations of the Tariff Board on a
reference to it and that reference was No.
134. It dealt with the free entry of certain
goods for religious, educational, scientific, literary or artistic purposes, as well as institutions and groups or for the benefit of afflicted
or handicapped persons.
The new schedule also broadens existing
duty-free privileges for goods used by such
institutions, persons and hospitals.
You may find some confusion when reading
the schedules. I remember that when we
amended the Customs Tariff a year ago a
question was asked in order to clarify a similar situation. Where the words "said act" appear in the bill they refer to the Customs
Tariff Act, and 'this act" refers to Bill C-140.
Therefore, while you have Schedules A, B
and C to this Bill C-140, these schedules are

December 2, 1969

Deoem.r 2.1969SENATE
DEBATES

lncorporated and replace certain items wblch
presently occur in Schedule A of the Customs
Tariff Act. If you detect a littie bit of glee in
what I arn going to say I will give you the
explanation in a moment.
Clauses 1 and 2 of the bill are concerned
with parhiamentary procedure to ensure that
the approval of Parliament is obtained within
a reasonable time after an order lin counicil is
made under certain paragraphs that are
referred to in these clauses. As the statute
presently reads, it is required that the order
in counicil be approved by Parliarnent within
180 days after the date of the order. It finally
occurred to the Governrnent that Parliament
might flot be sitting when the 180 days
expired, with the resuit that that particular
order in counicil would fall fiat on its face.
Accordingly, clauses 1 and 2 were proposed to
deal with the situation of Parliament flot sitting at that time. The order must be presented to and a resolution passed by both Houses
of Parliament not later than the fifteenth day
after the date on which Parliament commences its particular sittings.
The glee or gloating, or whatever you wish
to caîl it, has to do with this. These orders in
counicil to which I have referred may be
passed under the Customs Tariff where thxe
Governor in Council has the authority to
make reductions in tariffs in relation to countries which have done compensating things
tariffwise. It also deals with section 273 of the
Customs Act, where powers are given to the
Governor in Council to deal with certain subject matters either by way of raising or lowering rates of duty.
When I read thîs, there carne to mind the
Hazardous Products bil which we dealt with
approximately a year ago. That bill gave
power to the Governor in Council by order to
add hazardous produets to the list of such
products which were identified in fixe
schedule to that bill. When the Senate purported to provide that this order in coundcil
mnust, within a period of two years, be presented to both Houses of Parliarnent for
approval or it would fail and cease to have
any effect at that tirne, we were told that this
procedure would interfere with and clutter Up
the processes and procedures of Parliament,
and therefore it was not acceptable. We finally bowed and accepted an arnendrnent tixat
feil somewhere between these extremes.
I suggest that an order in coundcil uxxder thxe
Hazardous Products Act, adding another
product to that list, is not any greater in its
importance to fixe country than orders ix

counicil which reduce or include tariff rates
and schedules to our Customs Tariff. They are
not likely to be more numerous under a hazardous products bill tixan they are under the
Customxs Tariff or the Customs Act. If this
provision is acceptable-and it must be fully
acceptable because the Goverrnent has
included it lin the arnendnients which corne
forward at this tirne-therefore we must
assume that such procedures are readily
workable and wifl flot interfere or clutter up
the processes of Parliament. I would suggest
that the next Urne we are permitted to have a
look at the Hazardous Products Act and other
legislatîon of that nature, we use this as a
model in order to get back to the old idea
that at some stage when the Governor in
Coundil moves by order in counicil there
should be ratification or approval by Parliament. The penalty for not doîng this would be
that thxe order would cease to have any force
and effect after that date.
Hon. Mr. Martin: It should not be hazardous to do that.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: Under the circurnstances,
as my friend has well noted, that course in
itseli would not be creating a hazardous
situation.
Clauses 3 and il of fixe bul are tecbnical
changes arising out of the fact that as of
January 1, 1969, we established what was
called an Anti-Dumping Act. Under our old
dumping tax provisions, if there was a violation of fixe dumping provisions then one was
subi ect to special rates of tax. The dumping
duties, as such, disappear and there is rather
an anti-dumping provision. The elements that
were necessary to establish dumping under
the old law are not sufficient to bring into
force anti-dumping duties under the new law.
Actually, injury or damage to Canadian industry must be established.
Clause 3 provides authority for payment of
drawback. It deals with the drawback provisions. Since there are no longer dumping
duties or special duties these words become
rneaningless. Under clause 3 it is proposed
that subsection (1) of section il of the Customs Tariff Act be repealed and the following
substituted therefore:
On the materials set forth in Schedule
B, when used for consumption in Canada
for the purpose specified in that
Schedule, tixere may be pald out of fixe
Consolidated Revenue Fund the several
rates of drawback of Customs duties,
other than any special duty or surtax,. ..

SENATE DEBATES
This is a technical clarification of a situation
by reason of a change in the legislation as
the result of which dumping duties as such
no longer exist. Clause 11 is consequential
upon the changes in clause 3, which is the
authorizing section, and it simply strikes out
a certain heading in the Customs Tariff
Schedule B which is no longer necessary. You
will see that it strikes out the expression "not
including Special Duty or Dumping Duty"
fron the heading under Schedule B of the
act, which deals with drawback. That is just
a casual explanation in passing.
Clause 4 deals with this situation. As you
will recall, when we were dealing with the
Kennedy Round tariff changes there was a
whole list of these tariff items that were to be
implemented. There was a whole list of these
tariff items that were to be implemented in
stages. The final stage would be January 1,
1972.
The Government, as a result of its full
study of this situation, finally decided that it
would fully implement the tariff changes
brought about by the agreement on the Kennedy Round of tariff negotiations at one time,
and it would implement them fully on and
after June 4, 1969. In the budget announcements of June 3, 1969, these statements were
made, that is, that the Kennedy Round of
tariff negotiations were being fully implemented as of June 4, 1969.
We are getting now to the stage legislatively where we are considering legislation fully
implementing such determination. Clause 4 of
the bill provides for striking out the references in customs tariff items to "on and after
January 1, 1970, on and after January 1, 1971,
and on and after January 1, 1972"; and provides for the full implementation on and after
June 4, 1969.
It is suggested that it is particularly appropriate to this at a time of inflationary spiral,
that it may lead to a reduction in prices
because of the reductions in tariff on imported goods. On the other hand, it may be that
the people hurt would be producers of goods
which might be competitive with the imported goods in Canada.
This may al sound very well, but the difficulty is that the inflationary spiral has been
continuing. My own feeling is that the most
to expect from this full implementation at
this time, or as and from June 4, 1969, is that,
if the tariff items remained higher for the
additional time, there might necessarily be
further increases in price. I am sure that in
[Hon. Mr. Hayden.]

December 2, 1969

the interval since June 4, 1969, it may well be
that costs have gone up and that such costs
may come close to amounting to the difference between the tariff rate now proposed
and the higher rate which may have existed
prior to June 4, 1969. This, of course, overlooks the other point of view, that this change
to the full implementation in connection with
the higher pricing we have in Canada at this
time, may have the effect of increasing and
making more severe the competition with the
imported product.
Honourable senators, I should direct you to
something else, though you can certainly get
the information in committee. You will recall
that when this program was announced it was
indicated that the Government was setting up
what was called a General Adjustment
Assistance Board. That was set up by Order
in Council, P.C. 1968-651.
This board was intended to function in
cases where local or Canadian manufacturers
could make out a case for injury or damage
by reason of the immediate implementation
of the Kennedy Round. I have a report on this.
I do not intend to inflict the full report on you,
because you will recall generally what the
purpose was. There was a program under
the General Adjustment Assistance Board,
which was established to assist manufacturers
throughout Canada to adapt successfully to
changes in the new world trading environment brought about by the Kennedy Round
of tariff agrements.
It is significant that provisions were made
for giving loans in proper cases, and financial
grants and Government insurance, in some
cases, for a major portion of the risk which
might be necessarily inherent in the change,
and the full implementation of the tariff
changes.
It is significant that the initial reaction, as
reported, to the introduction of the program
resulted in more than 500 written inquiries
and 21 firrn requests for assistance. As of
today the board bas authorized insurance of
$6,178 million for loans aggregating $7,015,000
dollars and bas also authorized $73,875 in
consulting assistance grants for studies totalling $189,750.
Including the authorized applications, the
board bas considered the eligibility of 30
proposals, involving loan insurance of $85
million on restructuring programs which have
projected costs of some $304 million. Three of
these were ruled ineligible. In addition, one
application for insurance was declined.

December 2, 1969

SENATE DEBATES

I only recite this to illustrate what it was
anticipated might happen-that is, that there
might be some damage or injury to Canadian
industry-and what was devised at the time
to take care of it and how it was proceeding. I
do not pretend to analyze those results, as it
seems to me that this is more a matter to be
obtained from departmental officers in
committee.
Honourable senators, clause 8 of the bill
deals with miscellaneous tariff items set out
in Schedule D to the bill. Changes have been
made in the items which are dealt with in
Schedule D, as against what appears in
Schedule A. You simply read the statement
that you have, and read across the page and
you will be able to make your own
comparison.
Let us come to perhaps a more pleasant
item, which is contained in Schedules E and
F. This deals with Canadian residents returning from abroad and what they may bring
with them.
I had thought of many ways of referring to
this. I have a summary formula which I think
is of value to put on record. It provides that
under the existing rules, as and from June 4,
1969, the following is the situation:
1. Free entry once every four months for
goods to the value of $25 if brought back by a
traveller after an absence of 48 hours.
2. Free entry for goods up to the value of
$75 brought back by Canadian residents from
a point beyond the continental limits of North
America after an absence of at least 14 days.
If this $75 item is used, no further claim
may be made under either rule for 12
months-that is, under the $25 every four
months or under the $75 in a year.
The $75 and the $25 at the present time
may be combined as a single trip, and then
they would have the effect of giving $100
exemption. Of course, full duty and taxes are
collected on non-exempt items. While there is
no formal exemption at the present time from
payment of duty and taxes on small amounts
brought in, there seems to be a rule of thumb
that there is no pressure to insist in cases
where the value may be not more than $5.
As to the date from which these changes
are effective, this may be a little bit of the
carrot. These changes are effective January 1,
1970: first, free entry once every calendar
quarter for goods worth not more than $25 if
brought back by the traveller after an
absence of not more than 48 hours; second,
during each calendar year goods up to a
value of $100 may be brought back by

Canadian residents from any country after an
absence of at least 12 days. The use of the
annual exemption, that is, the $100, is completely independent of the quarterly exemptions. But the quarterly exemptions and the
$100 exemption may not be combined in a
single trip to amount to $125. In other words,
you may make a trip and be away 12 days
and in that case you can bring back duty-free
goods to a value of $100. You may on the
quarterly occasions during the year make
trips of at least 48 hours and bring back $25
worth of goods duty-free on each occasion.
Now, the combined 25 per cent rate of duty
and taxes on goods valued up to $100 imported by Canadian residents after an absence of
48 hours on goods not otherwise exempt is
the third change. This is another item where,
to the extent of $100, you may bring back
into Canada after an absence of at least 48
hours goods valued up to $100 by paying 25
per cent tax regardless of what the actual
duty may be on those goods. Of course, dutyfree goods, alcohol and tobacco, are excepted.
Regardless of the number of border crossings, a fiat $5 exemption is granted under
Schedule F where the total value of al goods
brought back by Canadian residents after a
48-hour absence does not exceed this amount.
In other words, you can use the $5 if you are
not going to make a claim for the larger
amounts of either $25 or $100.
Again, alcohol and tobacco are excepted,
although, as you will see in reading Schedule
F, there are occasions where the $100 exemption is provided; and that may include up to
40 ounces of alcohol, which I think should be
enough to see you across the border.
Hon. Mr. Smith: It is better than aftershave
lotion.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: You may bring tobacco
not exceeding 50 cigars, 200 cigarettes and
two pounds of manufactured tobacco where
the whole value is not more than $25. I am
sure the articles just enumerated would take
up the entire $25.
There are several clauses in the bill which
are quite uninteresting and unimportant, such
as clause 13 which refers to section 32 of the
Excise Tax Act. This simply provides that
the sales tax exemption granted under section
32 of the Excise Tax Act is not enlarged by
reason of the fact that the tariff items enumerated in section 32 of the Excise Tax Act are
broadened or have different rates of duty for
tariff purposes under the schedules which are
contained in this bill.

SENATE DEBATES
We come now to the coming-into-force
aspect of the bill. Clauses 4 to 9 of the bill
were deemed to have come into force on June
4, 1969. Clause 10 of the bill, which provides
for taking in Schedule F to which I have
referred, comes into force on January 1, 1970.
In substance, these are the provisions.
There could have been more detail, but it
seemed to me that perhaps there has been too
much detail in the past. I thought I should
emphasize certain points to give you some
kind of continuity as against our earlier dealings with the Kennedy Tariff Rounds and the
earlier customs bill.
I think any other matters could be more
properly developed in committee, and, at the
proper stage, I intend to move that the bill go
to the Standing Senate Committee on Banking, Trade and Commerce, which will be sitting tomorrow morning.
Hon. John M. Macdonald: Honourable senators, I know we are all very grateful to the
sponsor of the bill for his clear and detailed
explanation of the effects of the various
clauses. Indeed, after he has dealt with them
there is left very little to be said, because all
the questions we might have asked have been
anticipated and answered.
However, it is usually somewhat interesting
to reflect on the reasons for making changes
in the Customs Tariff. Especially is this so in
this day and age when debates on tariff
changes tend to be practical and, indeed,
often dull and sometimes tedious. This was
not always so. I suppose most of us, or at
least some of us, can remember the days
when changes in the tariff produced vigorous
and prolonged debate. There were great discussions between those who advocated a
system of protective tariff and those who
advocated a system of free trade. Both sides
used to present strong and compelling arguments to support their cause, and those
debates were interesting to listen to. However, those days are long since gone. Today,
changes in the Customs Tariff are a very
practical and business-like arrangement, usually the result of some hard bargaining with
other countries. Certainly, there is no longer
any danger of tariff changes provoking an
emotional or strong reaction from the people
at large.
In the past, too, various reasons would be
advanced for giving an industry the protection afforded by a tariff. I suppose the most
valid reason, apart from reasons of defence
purposes, was to allow Canadian manufactur[Hon. Mr. Hayden.]

December 2, 1969

ers to produce goods in competition with
similar goods produced in a foreign country.
The theory was that Canadian manufacturers
needed this tariff protection to enable them to
sell their goods in the domestic market until
they could get well established. Also, in
theory, this tariff protection would or could
be withdrawn once they were well established. However, I think it is apparent the
Customs Tariff has been used over the years
as an instrument of national policy in order
to encourage the establishment and growth of
various industries in Canada which it was felt
the country should have even though it would
cost the Canadian consumer more for their
products.
I suppose one might ask what the reasons
are for the changes being made in the Customs Tariff by this bill. As the sponsor mentioned, certain changes are being made as a
result of studies by the Tariff Board, and this
is usually the reason why tariffs are changed.
However, in this bill there are certain reductions now which normally would not have
been made until 1970, 1971 and 1972, under
the Kennedy Round agreements. I know honourable senators are well aware that the socalled Kennedy Round tariff reductions were
the result of prolonged and difficult negotiations among many countries. So far as Canada
was concerned, various reductions were to be
made on a staggered timetable in order, I
presume, to cause as little dislocation of business as possible. I think it is obvious that the
reductions agreed upon were motivated by the
old-fashioned desire to increase trade among
the nations and to give our exporters a better
entry into foreign markets and, at the same
time, to give Canadian consumers the benefit
of lower prices through foreign competition,
if such competition was fair and equitable.
Now, honourable senators, we see in this
case there was another and a new motive for
the acceleration of the Kennedy Round reductions. The bringing into effect of these reductions now instead of later, as originally
agreed upon, was part of the Government's
anti-inflation programs. It was a unilateral
arrangement by Canada and not the result of
a bargain whereby Canada obtained a trading
advantage in return from any other countries.
It was done because the Government believed
there was a need to increase the element of
price competition and efficiency in the domestic economy. In other words, the Government
must have felt that Canadian manufacturers
were not competing one against the other so

December 2, 1969

SENATE DEBATES

far as prices were concerned, or that they
were not efficient enough in their manufacturing operations to do so. So I think it is fair
to assume that the Government concluded
that a useful and effective way of intensifying
competition would be to put into effect last
June all the tariff reductions of the Kennedy
Round Agreements. So far as I know, it was
the first time in Canada that the Customs
Tariff was used as an anti-inflation measure,
and it will be interesting to learn just how
effective it was, if it was effective. Did it
reduce prices to the consumer? Did it reduce
prices to the producer which he in turn
passed on to the consumer or which he kept
for himself? I may say in passing that I
thought the sponsor of the bill went over that
portion of his statement very quietly, very
smoothly and very easily.
Was it an effective weapon against inflation
or bas the Government come to the conclusion that the type of inflation in Canada is
not the result of a lack of effective competition or a lack of efficiency, though these may
be contributing factors?
Honourable senators, any examination of
the various tariff items contained in the
schedule to this bill could be done much
better in committee than here. One thing
about them caught my interest and that is the
number of items which still have a large duty
under the general tariff. I expect we have
agreements with most countries so that they
would come under the Most-Favoured-Nation
tariff, and I wonder how many countries with
whom we trade would the general tariff apply.
In regard to clauses 1 and 2, which are to
clarify the parliamentary procedure relating
to these orders-in-council, I suppose there is
no objection to them. Someone must have felt
they were necessary or at least desirable. It is
rather hard to imagine that 180 days could
elapse without Parliament being in session to
approve of such orders, but perhaps it is
anticipated by someone that there will be
shorter and fewer sessions in the future.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: Three cheers for that.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald (Cape Breton): I agree.
I notice that in the present act the expression
"Parliament" is used whereas in the amendment the expression is "both Houses of Parliament". I do not know if there is any particular
significance to be attached to this change.
Honourable senators, I am sure there is no
objection to sending this bill to committee.
However, I would point out that in my view
21498-18

there is some danger in sending any matter to
a committee for consideration the day after it
bas been introduced here in this chamber. To
do so deprives many people of the opportunity
of being heard by the committee, in the event
that they wish to come before it to make representations.
Hon. Arthur W. Roebuck: Honourable senators, I have a question. The Kennedy Round
was devised, I think, for reducing the obstructions to international trade. We looked to it to
reduce the obstructions between ourselves
and the United States. I would like to know
whether the sponsor of the bill can give us
any idea of the amount of reduction, that is
the actual amount in practice, which bas
resulted from the changes which he has so
well described. Are there any figures available in connection with this which might be
estimates, that would give us some idea as to
what it has amounted to in a general way?
My friend Senator Macdonald bas said that
the old discussions on tariffs that were so
intensely voiced in the past are gone by the
board. Well, I for one am sorry for that. The
discussions that took place half a century ago
were vital, highly intellectual and dealt with
principles of trade that seem to have been
lost sight of in these modern times. It may be
that we have had so many counter-irritants
that we have forgotten about tariffs, but the
fact still remains that the increases in prices
as a result of tariff arrangements hamper our
foreign trade, make living in Canada more
difficult, increase the cost of living, and at the
same time offer special favours to certain
people. I wish we could have a very good
argument some time on free trade and let the
protectionists state their views and let the
free traders have their say. I think it would
be a fine thing to have such an argument
again as we used to have 25, 30, 40 or 50
years ago.
Hon Mr. Hayden: Honourable senatorsThe Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, I must inform the Senate that if the
honourable Senator Hayden speaks now it
will have the effect of closing the debate.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: Honourable senators, let
me at the outset reply to my friend Senator
Macdonald as to the length of time between
the reference of this bill to comnittee and its
actual consideration in committee. I have two
remarks to make in that regard; the first is
that the items which are in the bill were fully
dealt with by the Minister in the budget

SENATE DEBATES

speech delivered on June 3 and almost entirely incorporated in a bill presented to the
House of Commons at that time. Somehow or
other it did not go through the full course of
Parliament at that time.
Secondly, I should say that the changes as
between that bill and the present bill are
relatively few and, in fact, are minor changes
of a technical or language nature. This bill
was first introduced in the Commons on October 24, came up for second reading on
November 24 and was subsequently dealt
with. Therefore the interested public have
had quite an opportunity to become aware of
what it is proposed in Bill C-140. Furthermore, there was the establishment in 1968 of
the General Adjustment Assistance Board. Its
functioning certainly came to the attention of
all those who are likely to be affected by the
full implementation of the Kennedy Round,
because the board was established in 1968
and bas been functioning since and has many
applications before it. Therefore, there has
been a sort of general distribution or dissipation of knowledge.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: But has there been any

forum through which the members of the
public could express their opinions on this
matter-other than the press who have been
too busy with many other things?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: I was going to add my
second point, and had I had the opportunity
my friend's interjection might not have been
as necessary.
If the bill goes before committee-and I am
not urging that it should but am going to
move that it does-then it is up to the committee to decide when it actually considers it,
unless the Senate itself gives direction as to a
specific date and time. Then it is open to any
member of the committee or any senator to
attend the meeting at any time and state that
he thinks there are various elements to be
considered and ask that the hearing not be
completed so as to inquire as to any further
representations to be made. There bas been
no indication in all this time, excepting for
the complaints to which I have referred or
the inquiries which were addressed to this
General Adjustment Assistance Board and
requests for loans and grants by reason of the
fear they were going to be hurt. In order to
reach that stage I think you must assume
there was a general distribution of information. If the committee feels or any senator
makes a case supporting the fact there bas
not been a broad enough dissemination, the
[Hon. Mr. Hayden.]

December 2, 1969

committee is not going to be a hard taskmaster to force something through that should
have further consideration.
Dealing with the other question of my
friend Senator Roebuck, time may come and
time may go, but in season and out of season,
over all the years I have known him, and
even as I read about him before I got to know
him personally, he has always been a free
trader.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Hear. hear.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: When I attended his
ninetieth birthday celebration he invited
everyone to forget about it for ten years but
to be sure to attend, if they were still alive,
on his one hundredth birthday. He had no
doubt that be would be there, and it was
merely a question of who else was going to be
alive to be there. It may be the way things
are going now that this free trade cycle will
continue and be completed by the time we
join Senator Roebuck on his one hundredth
anniversary-and I am counting myself in on
that one-and by that time it would be the
crowning glory if we could say that, after one
hundred years, he has really achieved the
ambition of a lifetime.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: But you did not give
me those general figures.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: No. I have the figures by
individual items as to the imports, but they
would not give you much information. They
are in total dollars, and rather than give them
to you-in which case you would have to do
the arithmetic and look up the tariff to see
what the rates were which may have been
applied before the changes-I am sure this is
an area concerning which we can get the
information much more expeditiously from
the departmental officials.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Oh, yes.

SENATE DEBATES
and the fact that Ceylon is separated from it
by only 20 miles of water. Ceylon is about
four degrees north of the equator. This latter
fact was accentuated by the heat which greeted us when we emerged from our plane
because, although it was the cool time of the
year there, the temperature was much higher
than we had experienced at Delhi.
Our first contact with Ceylon was the
Colombo International Airport at Katunayake
which was constructed by a Canadian firm
with considerable assistance from the Canadian Government. The airport itself is a magnificant structure, well planned and well constructed, and is a monument to Canada which
is greatly appreciated by the people and government of Ceylon.
Assembled at the airport to meet us, along
with representatives of the Ceylon group of
the Inter-Parliamentary Union, were the High
Commissioner for Canada, Mr. J. Timmerman
and his good wife and members of his staff. I
cannot speak too highly of the High Commissioner. Along with our Ceylonese hosts, he
and his wife and staff did everything possible
to make our stay in Ceylon both pleasant and
profitable. The High Commissioner and his
wife are extremely popular. In private conversations with officials and prominent people
in industry, commerce, labour and education,
after we had become sufficiently acquainted, I
found that without exception they had the
highest praise for Mr. and Mrs. Timmerman.
It was very obvious that these two Canadians
are held in the highest regard and must,
therefore, be do'ng a wonderful job in maintaining good relations between Canada and
Ceylon.
Our itinerary began when we left the airport at 4.45 p.m., and from that moment until
we left Ceylon from the same airport at 10.45
p.m. on the following Wednesday, every
minute was accounted for.
We had a full program and a very tight
schedule, but I have never seen a better
organized itinerary. Much of the credit for
this was due to Mr. K. T. N. deSilva who as
assistant to the clerk of the House of
Representatives attended the I.P.U. Conference at Delhi as part of the delegation
secretariat. Mr. DeSilva and Mr. Kingsley
Karunatilleke travelled with us from Delhi to
Ceylon and accompanied us continuously as
we travelled around the island. No detail was
too small to engage their attention, and they
contributed immensely towards insuring our
comfort and convenience as well as enabling
.us to get the most from our visit.
[Hon. Mr. Carter.]

December 4, 1989

The drive from the international airport to
our hotel in Colombo took one hour. This
enabled us not only to see the great natural
beauty of the island with its tall palm trees,
coconut plantations and rubber plantations,
but also afforded an opportunity to make
comparisons with other countries that we had
visited. The first thing that impressed me was
that, unlike India, the bouses in the villages
through which we passed were not only
spaced much farther apart but were generally
of higher standard, and interspersed among
them and along the highway were bouses that
from the outward appearance would compare
favourably with most bouses in a Canadian
community of similar size.
Very rarely did we see women doing
manual labour, and everyone, including the
children, appeared to be well fed and fairly
well dressed in accordance with the needs of
the climate. Later I discovered that it is the
policy of the Ceylonese Government to distribute two kilograms of rice per person each
week. One kilogram is issued free by the
government and the other is paid for by the
recipient. No doubt this policy is in large
measure responsible for the healthy, well-fed
appearance of the Ceylonese people, particularly the children.
We were very comfortably accommodated
at Hotel Taprobane, which is located close
enough to the waterfront that by looking out
of the hotel window one could get an extensive view of Colombo Harbour. Taprobane, by
the way, is the name by which Ceylon was
known to the ancient Greeks and Romans.
Besides being the capital of Ceylon, Colombo
is also its largest seaport. This was confirmed
by the numerous ships tied up at the various
docks discharging and taking on cargoes, as
well as by the number of ships anchored in
the harbour awaiting their turn to dock.
That same night at 8 o'clock we were
guests at a dinner given by the Honourable S.
C. Shirley Korea at the Mumtaz Mahal, the
official residence of the Speaker of the House
of Representatives. Among the guests, were
our High Commissioner and a large number
of men prominent in the public, professional
and commercial life of Ceylon and their
wives. This afforded us our first opportunity
to get acquainted with the Ceylonese people
and to get a first-hand knowledge of their
problems and what they were trying to do
about them. It was close to midnight by the
time we got back to our hotel, and that meant
a very short night because we had to be up
again by 6 a.m. in order to be on time for
that day's program.

December 4, 1969

SENATE DEBATES

On Sunday morning we left Colombo by
car at 7.30 for Polonnaruwa. We arrived there
at 1.30 p.m. and were put up at a picturesque,
comfortable rest house on the shore of a very
beautiful lake.
Polonnaruwa, 133 miles northeast of
Colombo, is one of the ancient capitals of
Ceylon which reached its zenith in the eleventh century. The population of Ceylon at
that time was estimated at about 20 million,
as compared to two million in the early part
of the twentieth century and approximately
12 million today. We are prone to think of
India as a vastly overpopulated country, but
when the two countries are compared as to
size, Ceylon, with a total area of only 25,000
square miles, has a population density nearly
twice that of India.
After having lunch at the rest house, we
spent the whole afternoon looking at ruins of
temples, palaces and dome-shaped shrines,
called dagabas, which extended for six miles
in each direction from the rest house.
Polonnaruwa is by no means the oldest of
the ancient cities of Ceylon. Anuradhapura
was founded in the fifth century B.C. and is
today venerated as a capital city of Buddhism. In the heart of this city is a sacred
Bo-tree over 2,200 years old, the oldest historically documented tree in the world. It was
a sapling of the original tree under which at
Buddh Gaya, in north India, the Buddha himself found enlightenment. It was brought to
Ceylon in the third century B.C., and has
never since been without its hereditary
attendants and the care of the country's
rulers.
At 8:00 a.m., Monday, November 10, we left
Polonnaruwa. An hour and a half later we
arrived at Sigiriya, where we spent the rest
of the forenoon visiting the rock fortress for
which Sigiriya is noted. Sigiriya is sometimes
referred to as the fortress in the sky because
of the way it suddenly bursts into view, silhouetted against an infinitely blue sky as one
rounds a bend in the jungle road. But it was
no mere forlress. It was a city dating back to
473 A.D., and one of the loveliest ever built. It
lay in a large square area, walled and moated
in the west, and with a walled rectangle in
the east. At the centre stood the great rock,
the citadel, with the king's palace and throne
at the very summit. Today it is a colossal ruin
which has only recently been reclaimed from
the jungle. It is also a treasure house of rare
art. In a pocket in the giant rock are the
famous frescoes of the ladies of Sigiriya.

These are the remnants of an enormous gallery which once contained 500 portraits. The
rock walls and ceiling of the cave were covered with a kind of white plaster on which
the portraits were painted. This kind of plaster cannot be duplicated today. Its manufacture has become a lost art.
After lunching at the rest house in Sigiriya
we left at 2 p.m., and a half-hour's drive
brought us to Dambulla where we visited the
rock temple. This temple is hewn out of the
solid rock. Originally it was probably a cave,
but it was enlarged by chipping away the
walls and ceiling to form a spacious temple,
and in some cases a series of temples, with
massive sculptures of the Buddha in sitting or
reclining positions, also carved out of the
solid rock.
During our tour of these ruined cities we
were very privileged to have as our guide Mr.
Marcus Fernando, chief government archeologist, whose commentary, explanations, and
answers to our questions made the visit much
more interesting and meaningful than it otherwise would have been.
This tour of the ancient ruins impressed
upon me certain important facts. The first is
that the history of Ceylon is rooted deep in
antiquity, as is the history of India and China
and other eastern countries. The second is
that centuries before the first European set
foot in Ceylon, a highly developed society
thrived in this area. This is abundantly
emphasized by the quality of the paintings
and sculptures, and of the engineering feats
which were accomplished. This civilization
reached its peak around the ninth or tenth
century A.D. when the total population of
Ceylon was about 20 million. For some reason
it then declined and disappeared completely,
and to this very day historians, archaeologists
and other students of this phenomenon have
not been able to explain adequately why it
happened.
The third thing that impressed me about
the ruins was the system of irrigation which
supported these ancient cities. Within each
city-built as they were in regions where the
rains fell but once in a year and then only
briefly-and throughout all its populous hinterland was constructed a unique system of
man-made lakes or reservoirs, called tanks,
with interconnecting channels, engineered
with incredible skill so that, as one of the old
kings of Polonnaruwa put it, no drop of water
should pass to the sea but it had first served
the needs of his people. One of these channels
is 21 miles long at a point 11 miles from its

SENATE DEBATES
intake, and another is 54 miles long and 40
feet wide. The latter falls only six inches per
mile in its first 17 miles and feeds a large
number of subsidiary tanks on its way. So
vital is the irrigation system that reservoirs
punctuate the entire landscape in this part of
the country, constituting an ancient irrigation
system which still baffles modern engineering
explanation.
Perhaps the most impressive thing about
these old ruined cities is the evidence they
bear to the ancientness and continuity of the
Buddhist faith upon which they were built.
Here are no cities of palaces and secular
monuments, but overwhelming evidences of a
faith held precious over all things. They are
cities of monasteries and shrines to which
even the pomp of kings yielded first place.
There is complete freedom of worship for
the Hindus, Christians and Moslems who
inhabit Ceylon, because the constitution
guarantees freedom of worship for all. Buddhism is the religion of the majority, and it is
impossible to fully appreciate the values and
attitudes of the Ceylonese people without an
understanding of this religion. Moreover, the
Buddhist revival
was associated
with
independence and has been closely linked to
political development ever since. At the same
time it is probably safe to say that Ceylon's
search for identity since independence has
brought Buddhist values to greater prominence than they might otherwise have
enjoyed.
Buddhism is a highly individualistic system
in which each person is responsible for his
own enlightenment. It probably tolerates a
greater variation of views than are encompassed by all Christian denominations together. This makes it difficult for a Buddhist to
generalize about his faith.
The form of Buddhism practised in Ceylon
is described by the term "theravada." It
stresses the value of detachment and noninvolvement in worldly affairs. In the Buddhist philosophy man experiences a succession of births and rebirths and spends his
time finding a way of release from the world
of sorrow and futility. Yet despite the stress
of pain and sorrow, it holds out the hope
that if one lives rightly he will find release.
In this regard the important concept under
Buddhism is "karma", or cause and effect.
Howard Wriggens in his book entitled Ceylon,
Dilemmas of a New Nation describes karma
in these words:
That what I am in this life is in considerable part the result of what I have
[Hon. Mr. Carter.]

December 4, 1969

thought and done in past lives. What I
am is only in part what I am given. I am
also what I make of what I am given. My
future is what I make of myself today.
The Buddhist monk retires from the world
precisely to lead a life of disciplined search
for enlightenment and release. The layman,
burdened with his commitments to his family
and his occupation, cannot do this to the same
extent. He is therefore expected to develop
for himself the kind of life which will require
the utmost simplicity, a generosity that stems
from his own inward mastery of greed and a
consideration of others that flows from the
unimportance he attaches to himself. In fact,
there is a specific code of behaviour that sets
forth for the layman rules for the good life
and the vices he should not indulge in. The
Buddhist system of values and the outlook
which stems from them differ widely from
most western countries. They stand out in
stark contrast to those of the former rulers of
Ceylon. Another significant difference which
impressed me was the intensity of their worship and devotion. Unlike many Christians
whose actions often deny what they profess to
believe, the Buddhist is a true believer in that
his beliefs carry over into his daily life and
influence his relations with his fellowman.
At 7 p.m. on Monday we arrived at Kandy.
There we were lodged at the Hotel Suisse,
which is a beautiful tourist resort on the
shores of Kandy Lake. Kandy is 72 miles
from Colombo and serves as the link between
ancient and relatively recent history. The
latter dates back to the beginning of the sixteenth century, when Ceylon was colonized
by the Portuguese. In the mid-seventeenth
century the Dutch ousted the Portuguese and
in 1796 the British displaced the Dutch. Kandy's connection with the past lies in the
sacred tooth relic of the Buddha, which is
treasured in the temple called the Belada
Maligawa.

Hon. Mr. Martin: Which is the temple of
the tooth, is it not?
Hon. Mr. Carter: The temple of the tooth.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: Were you there?
Hon. Mr. Martin: Many years ago, before
the Opposition was even born.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: Oh, no.
Hon. Mr. Carter: Cradled in the bowl of
five surrounding hills, Kandy is also the gateway to greater elevations, of over 6,000 feet

above sea level, and the famous hili resorts of
Ceylon. The dlimate there is salubrious, the
air being dry and the temperature moderate.
Towerlng over much of the hill country is
the sacred sentinel-a mountain venerated for
centuries by devotees of many faiths. To the
Buddhist it is Sri Pada, for there is f ound the
Footprint of the Buddha; to the Hindu it is
the Footprint of God Siva, hence called
Sivanadipathan; and to the Moslem it is the
Footprint of Adam, from. whlch it derives the
naine of Adam's Peak.
At 8.30 that night we were entertained at
dinner, in his officiai residence, by Mr. W. J.
Fernando, the government agent at Kandy.
After dinner two films were shown on an
outdoor screen, one depicting Independence
Day celebrations and the other the Esala
Perahera.
The Perahera is a spectacular religious pageant which is held every year between July
and August in honour of the sacred tooth
relic of Buddha. Participating in it are nearly
a hundred richly caparisoned elephants, along
with drummers, dancers and chieftains ln traditional regalia. Foilowing the films, we were
treated to a performance of pure Kandyan
dance art by the Kandyan Dance Ensemble69, sponsored by the Kandyan Arts Council.
The dances were done by the most talented
artists of Ceylon and greatly enjoyed by ail.
Tuesday morning we set out at 9.30 to visit
the Temple of the Tooth. On our way we
stopped at a handicraft centre where we saw
artisans engaged in metalwork, basket-weaving, mat-weaving and making hand-loomed
fabrics. Most of the delegation took advantage
of this opportunity to purchase some souvenirs. The Temple of the Tooth has a very
beautiful setting. In front of it is an artificial
lake augmentlng the serenity and calmn of the
medieval city, and beside it stands the palace
of the last King of Kandy, which now bouses
a museum devoted to the Kandyan period of
the island's hlstory. We were conducted on
the temple tour by Senator Hl. B. Udurawana,
who is also the custodian of the Holy Tooth
relic. To give a full account of this tour
would take at least haîf an hour. I hope that
one of my colleagues will fill in this gap
because, due to pressure of time, I can make
only passing reference to it.
From the Temple of the Tooth we drove
tbrough the Royal Botanical Gardens at
Peradeniya, where I spotted a new strain of
orchid whlch had been named '«Olive Diefenbaker". Fromn there we went to the University

of Ceylon in the samne city, where we were
entertained at lunch by Professor E. O. E.
Pereira, the Vice-Chancellor.
Hon. Mr. Martin: Will the honourable senator permit me to interrupt? Did he say something about Olive Diefenbaker?
Hon. Mr. Carter: We saw in the botanicai
gardens a new strain of orchid that has been
developed and which has been namied "Olive
Diefenbaker".
Hon. Mr. Martin: The fiower could not have
a nicer naine.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: Did the honourable senator hear of any fiower being named "Paul
Martin"? The Leader of the Government was
there, and that fact should be perpetuated i
some way.
Hon. Mr. Martin: Perhaps the honourable
senator wiil permit me to say that I would be
very happy to be associated with that dellghtfui and charming woman in that particular
garden.
Hon. Mr. Carter: I thought this fact would
interest ail honourable senators, so I made
note of it.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: I should like to ask the
honourable senator a question. Did he meet
up with any of those female mosquitoes that
fed on me when I was in Ceylon, after which
I spent three weeks in hospital in Madras
close to death?
Hon. Mr. Carter: No, we did not meet up
with any mosquitoes, maie or female. We had
mosquito nets provided for our beds, which
we did not need to use.
At the time of our visit the university was
closed because of student riots that had taken
place earlier. In a brief speech at the luncheon Professor Pereira pointed out that the
existence of the university, particularly the
Department of Geology, was due in large
measure to Canadian aid.
In the afternoon we visited the Hantane
Tea Estate at Kandy, where we saw tea being
gathered and processed through its varlous
stages, and we were entertained to a delightfui afternoon tea i their beautiful mountain
home by Mr. and Mrs. R. C. Moraes, manager
of the tea estate. The tea factory was located
at a very high elevation, more than twothirds Up the siope. The purpose, I was told,

SENATE DEBATES
was to utilize the dry natural air in the
curing of the tea, and that this advantage
outweighed the cost of constructing and
maintaining the long winding road. From
Kandy we returned to Colombo. On our way
back we were fortunate to see a number of
elephants bathing and being bathed by their
owners in the river, a most interesting sight.
We got back to our hotel Taprobane around
seven o'clock and were glad to have an evening to ourselves.
Wednesday, November 12, our last day in
Ceylon, was a continuous round of social
engagements. We started out by calling on
His Excellency William Gopallawa, M.B.E.,
the Governor General, at his official residence. At twelve noon we visited the Parliament Buildings and called on Senator the
Honourable A. Ratnayake, the President of
the Senate, who was our host at a most
enjoyable luncheon.
The parliamentary institutions of Ceylon,
like those of Canada, are patterned after the
Mother of Parliaments in Britain, and so far
the structure inherited from the British has
been retained intact. The Senate of Ceylon
has 30 members, of whom 15 are elected by
the House of Representatives and 15 are
nominated by the Governor General on the
advice of the Prime Minister. Senators are
appointed for a six-year period, one-third
retiring every second year. The constitution
also requires that not less than two ministers,
one of whom shall be the Minister of Justice,
shall be members of the Senate. Because of
its small numbers the Senate is handicapped
in setting up committees of inquiry, as is
done in Canada. Real power resides in the
House of Representatives, which is elected by
adult franchise and has 157 seats; of these,
151 are elected, and six are appointed by the
Governor General on the advice of the Prime
Minister to represent minority groups.
The present Government of Ceylon is a
coalition of 86 members, of whom 73 belong
to the United National Party, six are appointees of the Governor General, two are
independents, and the remaining five are distributed among three parties. The United
National Party is a party of the centre, pursuing national unity and a planned economy in
which both public and private sectors
participate.
The opposition is also a coalition, of which
the three main parties have 41, 12 and 8 members respectively. Next ta them comes the
Moscow wing of the Communist Party with
[Hon. Mr. Carter.]

December 4, 1969

four members, four other parties with one
member each and one independent.
In the afternoon we called on the Prime
Minister, the Honourable Dudley Senanayake,
who is the son of Ceylon's first Prime Minister. Then we went to Canada House, where
we were again entertained by the High Commissioner for Canada and his wife, and from
there we departed for the airport, where we
arrived at 8.30 p.m. and were tendered a final
farewell dinner in the Colombo International
Airport restaurant by the Honourable E.L.B.
Hurulle, Minister of Communications. This
very enjoyable function lasted right up until
10.45 p.m., when we boarded our plane for
home.
From what I have said you will see that the
itinerary and schedule of our visit in Ceylon
was, if anything, a bit overcrowded. Nevertheless, we did have time to form some
impressions and check them with informed
people in various walks of life who were in a
position to give us first-hand information.
The first impression I got was one of purposeful activity and a reasonable degree of
prosperity. The system of roads is very well
developed and very well maintained. I have
already referred to the well-fed and welldressed appearance of the people. When
Ceylon achieved independence in 1948 ber
agricultural industry was very poorly developed, necessitating huge food imports, especially rice, which were paid for by the exportation of tea, rubber and cocoanut products,
which at that time brought fairly high prices
in the world's markets. In 1965, however, the
world prices of these products dropped considerably, thereby producing a serious foreign
exchange

crisis.

To meet this situation the Government
imposed drastic restrictions on all imports,
including essentials, and most of these are
still in effect. In addition, the Government
launched a campaign to increase domestic
production of food with the hope of eliminating most food imports altogether. We saw
numerous rice paddies in various stages of
cultivation, and this "grow more food" campaign has been so remarkably successful that
the country is, approaching its target of 75 per
cent self-sufficiency in rice by 1970.
In addition, the Government is attempting
to diversify the economy and has already laid
the groundwork for this by establishing a
steel industry, a cement industry and a construction industry. The Government's development program has been assisted by substantial injections of foreign aid, but large

December 4, 1969

SENATE DEBATES

inflows of assistance will continue to be
needed for many years to corne. In addition,
Ceylon with its beautiful beaches, its comfortable rest houses and its wide variation of
temperatures and climate has a tremendous
tourist potential which for the most part still
remains to be developed.
There is also a potential for a forest industry. We were delighted to learn that a forestry consultant firm from Canada was due to
arrive in Ceylon to undertake a feasibility
study of a proposed logging operation which
would serve to supply the needs of a new
plywood mill now under construction. Ceylon,
which possesses vast forest resources, now
imports 20 million rupees of plywood annually to make tea chests alone. A plywood mill
would, therefore, contribute a significant
saving in foreign exchange. Should the
recommendations in the feasibility study be
approved, it could mean that a major logging
operation would be implemented by Canada
over a five-year period.
Honourable senators, this was the first time
a Canadian parliamentary delegation had
ever visited Ceylon and we were given royal
treatment. The Ceylonese people are kind,
warm, friendly and generous. They made us
feel that they just could not do enough for us.
Canada's relations with Ceylon have developed principally through our common membership in the Commonwealth, the Colombo
Plan and the United Nations. There is a tremendous amount of goodwill towards Canada
and the Canadian people in Ceylon arising
out of the construction of the international
airport and Canada's policy of "no strings
attached" economic assistance. I have a feeling that our invitation to Ceylon was in some
respects an outward and visible token of their
appreciation of that assistance, and as a result
of this visit I am certain that the ties between
Canada and Ceylon are stronger than ever.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Walter M. Aseltine: I would like to
correct the honourable senator when he said
it was the first parliamentary delegation that
had ever visited Ceylon. The honourable
Speaker of the Senate and I represented a
large delegation from the Parliament of
Canada in 1957 when we went to New Delhi,
India, for the Commonwealth Parliamentary
Conference. We spent 10 days in Ceylon and
visited the various places mentioned by the
honourable senator. That was where we met
up with these female mosquitoes I spoke of,
and where I was bitten by one and spent

three weeks in the hospital at Madras at
death's door. I made up my mind when I got
back to Canada that I would not visit Ceylon
for a long time.
Hon. Mr. Carter: I should like to thank my
honourable friend for that correction. I made
that statement because that is what I was told
when we were in Ceylon, and I had no reason
to doubt its accuracy.
As for the mosquitoes, I can assure my
honourable friend that they must have been
obliterated in the intervening 10 years since
he was there, because we were not bothered
with them at all and I would be quite happy
to go back to Ceylon at any time an opportunity presented itself.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Fournier (Madawaska-Restigouche), debate adjourned.
VISITING AMERICAN ASTRONAUTS
DISTRIBUTION OF INVITATIONS TO BANQUET
-QUESTION

Hon. John M. Macdonald: Honourable senators, may I ask the Leader of the Government
a question.
Did the Government of Canada, or any
department thereof, tender a banquet on
Tuesday, December 2 last, in honour of the
three American astronauts and, if so, how
many invitations to such banquet were allotted to the Senate, and how were these distributed? If such banquet was not tendered
by the Government, did any department of
Government issue invitations for it and, if so,
how many were allotted to the Senate, and
how were these distributed?
I realize the Leader may not have this
information. Perhaps he will take note of the
question and answer it at his convenience.
Hon. Paul Martin: Honourable senators, I
may not be able to give the complete answer,
but I will give as much as I can and if it
needs to be supplemented I will be glad to
add to it next week.
I understand that the dinner for the
astronauts on Tuesday night was given by the
National Research Council. It was presided
over by the minister who reports to Parliament for that body, the President of the
Treasury Board. There were members from
both houses present. I learned after the event
that in the case of the other place they were
selected by lot, by drawing of numbers,
although I cannot give the exact numbers. As
to members of the Senate, the President of

SENATE DEBATES
the Treasury Board, on behalf of the
Research Council, invited members of the
Science Committee, the Speaker of the Senate
and the Leader of the Opposition.
NEWSPAPER REPORT
GOVERNMENT SUPPORT IN SENATEPRIVILEGE

Hon. A. Hamilton McDonald: Honourable
senators, before the Orders of the Day are
called, I rise on a question of privilege to
correct an article that appeared in the press.
Perhaps I am out of order, but it does concern
this assembly. I am reported as having said
that there were two supporters of the Government in the Senate.
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: Only two?
Hon. Mr. McDonald: It has been incorrectly stated that there were two supporters of
the Government in the Senate; we all know
that there are now four.
Hon. Mr. Grosart: Who are the other three?
Hon. Mr. McDonald: My reference is to
Saskatchewan.
Hon. Mr. Martin: Did I understand the
honourable senator to say that there are only
four Government supporters in the Senate?
Hon. Mr. McDonald: I mean from Saskatchewan.
Hon. Mr. Grosari: It may be that you were
right the first time.
NORTH ATLANTIC ASSEMBLY
FIFTEENTH ANNUAL CONFERENCE
BRUSSELS, BELGIUM-DEBATE
CONTINUED

AT

The Senate resumed from Thursday,
November 20, the debate on the inquiry of
Hon. Mr. McDonald, calling the attention of
the Senate to the Fifteenth Annual Conference of the North Atlantic Assembly, held at
Brussels, Belgium, 16th to 21st October, 1969,
and in particular to the discussions and the
proceedings of the Conference and the participation therein of the delegation from
Canada, and to the visit of the delegation
from Canada to NATO Bases in Europe.
Hon. Allister Grosart: Honourable senators,
we have heard interesting and excellent
reports and comments on the Fifteenth North
Atlantic Assembly meeting in Brussels in
October, particularly from Senator A. H.
[Hon. Mr. Martin.]

Decernber 4, 1969

McDonald,
Senator Robichaud,
Senator
Welch, Senator White and Senator Grattan
O'Leary.
In all of those speeches I detected some
embarrassment about Canada's decision to
downgrade its role in NATO. More than
ambarrassment, I think I detected some foreboding for the future as a possible result of
this decision, a decision which, as honourable
senators will recall, has already been the subject of protest in this chamber by Senators
Aird and Lang.
My own foreboding goes even further. It is
based on the fact that those same voices
which have been demanding the downgrading
of our role in NATO are now vociferously
demanding our complete withdrawal from
NATO. If I read the record correctly, NATO
is certainly the most successful and the most
effective mutual defence and peacekeeping
alliance among free nations in the history of
the world.
NATO is, of course, much more than a
mere defence alliance, as Senator O'Leary
pointed out very eloquently in his comment
in this debate. It has a political role, it has an
economic role, a social role and a cultural
role-and therein lies the certainty of the
success of NATO in the future, whether
Canada wishes to help or not.
However, it is with the defence and peacekeeping aspect of our NATO alliance that I
wish to speak this afternoon. It is particularly
important that this matter be discussed, in
view of the timing of the announcement, an
announcement which shocked many people
around the world, coming as it did immediately after the third brutal rape of Czechoslovakia in history, that Canada had decided
to downgrade its participation in the NATO
front line.
It has already lost us a good deal of international respect-and I will have some comment to make on that later. As a matter of
fact, in the world press today, over and over
again there is comment about the Canadian
position in respect to NATO, which is more
damaging than any comment I have seen
during the time I have been reading the
world press. In addition to the loss of our
international prestige, I have reason to fear
that in the future, if an attack comes, the
costs will be much greater in men, materials
and friends.
Some will say that the danger which confronted the NATO nations in 1948 is not present today. I believe that, as I go along, I will
be able to indicate-as Senator Yuzyk did in

December 4, 1969

SENATE DEBATES

a very fine speech in this Senate a few days
ago-that the danger is as great today, if not
greater, than it was on April 28, 1948, when
the Right Honourable Louis St. Laurent rose
in the Canadian House of Commons and
became the first world statesman to advocate
that Canada and the United States-and other
countries as well-join the five nations which
at that time had, of necessity, banded themselves together for mutual defence.
How pitiful is the contrast between the
staunch support that three great Prime Ministers-St. Laurent, Pearson and Diefenbakergave to NATO, and the petty quibbling we
hear now about isolationism and neutrality as
roles for Canada in world affairs. Surely, if
we are attacked, if there is aggression, we
will need allies in the planning of our defence
with other countries, and we will need strategies integrated with those of our allies-if
we have them.
Hon. Mr. Martin: We have.
Hon. Mr. Grosart: We have them, and we
are letting them down. If we still have them
we can take off our hats to them for their
generosity, because people do not usually
make allies of those who let them down in
the way we have let down those who are
sitting under the Iron Curtain, those who are
in immediate and daily threat to their lives
and who relied on us to support them and to
defend that line if Soviet aggression once
again attempted to roll westward in Europe.
I say we cannot expect the full support of
those allies if we downgrade our support to
them now. Now is the time when they want
our support. I believe the time will come
when we will want their support much more
than some think we may need it now.
Honourable senators, in support of this, I
would like to put before you four general
assertions. The first is that NATO was created
in the face of imminent aggression and that
nothing less than the strongest measure of
preparedness on the NATO line will continue
to meet that aggression.
The second is that NATO came into being
not specifically as a United States initiative,
not as a European initiative, but, as I have
indicated, on the Canadian initiative of the
Honourable Louis St. Laurent, in wise recognition at that time that Canadian survival
and sovereignty may very well rest, now and
in the future, on the kind of association we
have with the other free nations of the world.
The third assertion I will make is that it is
NATO and NATO alone which has stopped

aggression in Europe; stopped the Iron Curtain from rolling our way over the last 20
years. The defence role of NATO has in itself
become a deterrent, and the deterrent, as we
all know, has become a détente.
The fourth assertion I will make is that the
NATO alliance remains essential to the
defence of Canada today and that the idea
that we can take shelter in some concept of
neutrality or in isolationism or in continentalism which, whatever they may be called, are
politically stupid and militarily nonsensical.
The first of those assertions is that NATO
was an absolute necessity for the defence of
Europe and North America 20 years ago.
Canadians too often forget the assertions that
were made by Mr. St. Laurent at that time
and the emphasis he put on Canada's selfinterest in an association such as we have
undertaken with NATO. A mere look at the
map will explain why.
During the war Soviet imperialism took
over eight national entities, as Senator McDonald pointed out in his very excellent
speech on the motion, and 23 million non-Russian people went behind the Iron Curtain. As
honourable senators will remember, it was at
that point that Mr. Churchill, later Sir Winston Churchill, sent his famous telegram to
Mr. Harry Truman, President of the United
States: "They have rolled down the Iron Curtain on their front". Incidentally, that was
the first use of that famous phrase.
That was only the beginning. Mr. Churchill,
in all his wisdom, was at that point surely not
aware of what was going to happen in the
next three years. Here, across the map of
Europe, had been set up a block, and, if
honourable senators wish to look at that map
and shade in those countries and parts of
countries that were taken over, they will find
that before the war was ended the U.S.S.R.
had set up an almost continuous block from
the Arctic to the Caspian sea. They set up a
buffer state in much the same way that a
bandit will grab a child or a woman in order
to hold that person in front of him to ward
off an attack. That is what the Soviets did.
That was, as I say, only the beginning. In the
next three years those 23 million people who
had been enslaved behind the Iron Curtain
became 113 million, an additional 90 million
being added in the terrible days of 1945 to
1948.
What happened at that point? Honourable
senators, what happened then was the formation of NATO. NATO was formed with a

SENATE DEBATES
speed and efficiency probably never equalled
in the history of alliances as large and as
complicated. Since the formation of NATO,
not one square foot of free Europe has gone
behind the Iron Curtain.
It is from this accomplishment, this keeping
of the peace of the world for 20 years, that
Canada now wishes to withdraw-by half, by
two-thirds or, perhaps, completely. Statements that have been issued on the side of
the Government are so utterly confusing that
I doubt if there is anyone who really knows
what the express intent of the Government is.
Perhaps the honourable Leader of the Government in this house, who bas had intimate
knowledge of the matters of which I speak,
may even have an intimate knowledge of
Government policy on NATO. If he has, he is
probably the only member of the cabinet who
does have. But, if be will venture an opinion
on whether we are going to half pull out,
three-quarters pull out or completely pull out,
I will listen with the greatest of interest,
because I have searched the documents and
there is no clear, positive statement about it.
The reaction all over Europe is that they
are asking Canada: "What are you up to?
What are you going to do? Do you really
mean it?" They are not for one minute
accepting the bland statement that we are not
downgrading our role in NATO but are just
pulling out the troops, bringing them back
and holding them here in Canada where they
will be available. The nations of Europe are
not accepting that for one minute. The
nations of Europe are saying that our commitment was to have our troops in Europe on
the front line so that when the shooting started we would be there and would be involved.
Those nations sitting in daily fear of their
freedom will not be interested in wondering
whether Canada or the United States or anybody not immediately involved will come to
their defence; what they fear is that we will
have a long discussion in Parliament wondering whether we should honour what commitments may be left of our NATO agreement.
They fear that, if we wait until we get parliamentary consent rather than automatie
acceptance of our commitment, it will be too
late.
Hon. Mr. Lamontagne: Such as we had in
Cuba.

December 4, 1969

United States acted very swiftly in Cuba. In
terms of international law, they acted illegally, but swiftly. Why? Because the threat was
close at hand. And Canadians supported the
action of President Kennedy enthusiastically,
I believe. Why? Because the threat was close
at hand; because it came in an area where
many Canadians had their homes.
The honourable senator is quite right. We
acted swiftly. But the Europeans are not convinced that we will act that swiftly in future,
when they see us withdrawing our troops
from the front line now.
Hon. Mr. Phillips (Rigaud): Will the honourable gentleman permit a question? Do the
European countries, to whose cri'icism of
Canada you refer so vividly, include France?
Hon. Mr. Grosart: I am not sure. I am
trying to think whether, in the many press
clippings I have seen, France as such bas
made any pronouncement on the subject. I do
not believe France bas, as such, but I can
assure the honourable senator that many
informed commentators in France have.
Hon. Mr. Phillips (Rigaud): I am not interested in assurances; I simply wanted to elicit
a fact as to whether France, as a country, had
raised an objection.
Hon. Mr. Grosari: Perhaps the honourable
senator will recall what I just said, that I do
not know whether France, as a country, has,
because it is a rather indefinite terrn. But
important and influential French people have.
I would rather doubt if France as such has
criticized our stand, although they might very
well do so. I would point out that even though
they changed their role in NATO, they left
their troops in which is very different from
the action which Canada has taken. If we had
done the same thing there would not have
been this tremendous downgrading of the
image of Canada around the world. If there
are any further questions, I would be happy
to answer them. And if I am speaking with
some feeling and with some emotion, it is
because I am embarrassed and ashamed of
the position that the Government of my country is taking in this vital matter.
Hon. Mr. Martin: I do not think my honourable friend should be ashamed.

Hon. Mr. Choquetie: One member of the
Hon. Mr. Grosart: As we had in Cuba? I other place is and be just crossed the floor
because of that.
should be very interested in discussing the
Cuban situation. I am very glad that Senator
Hon. Mr. McDonald: That is his privilege,
Lamontagne raised the matter, because the but he did not cross it all the way.
[Hon. Mr. Grosart.]

Harkness.
Hon. Mr. Grosari: I am apparently not the
only one who feels some emotion or some
feeling in this matter. It is reciprocated on the
other side and that is a good sign. We do not
have enough of that here.
The second thing I would point out is that
NATO came into being as a result of Canadian initiative. This should serve to dispel the
impression we are given at this time that our
NATO role is some kind of outdated European involvement. Let me briefly recapitulate
some of the history leading up to the formation of NATO. In February, 1948 we had the
coup d'état in Czechoslovakia. The following
month five nations in Europe associated
themselves in a mutual defence treaty called
the Brussels Treaty after the same city where
the conference which is the subject of this
debate was held. These five nations were Belguim, France, the United Kingdom, Luxembourg and The Netherlands. The following
month Mr. St. Laurent rose and made his
historic proposal that Canada and the United
States should associate themselves with that
pact. Then in June we had the blockade of
Berlin, and Senator Vandenberg rose in the
United States Senate to propose his famous
resolution expressing the determination of the
United States to utilize if necessary the
powers, authority and rights as laid down in
Article 51 of the United Nations Charter to
join with other nations within NATO in a
mutual defence pact. In a few months the
treaty was ready and it was signed in April
1949. In addition to the original five Brussels
nations there was now the United States,
Canada, Italy, Iceland, Denmark, Portugal,
Norway and these were later joined by West
Germany, Turkey and Greece. If NATO needs
any justification you will find it in the fact
that West Germany is today on our side and
not on the other side.
In that initiative Mr. St. Laurent was greatly strengthened by another great Canadian,
Mr. Pearson. As honourable senators will
remember, Mr. Pearson was a member of the
Committee of Three, the three wise men of
NATO, who were commissioned to report on
aspects other than the military, namely, the
political, economic and social aspects and give
NATO the value of their judgment. That
report was very surprising because although
it was so completely on the non-military side,
the whole stress was on the essential nature of
the maintenance of military defence and the

peacekeeping role of the alliance. If I may
quote a few random excerpts from the report,
the first speaks of NATO's objective
of finding a secure and honourable basis
for competitive and ultimately for cooperative co-existence with the Communist world.
This should dispel the idea we hear put forward so often that NATO is a deterrent to the
concept of co-existence.
The report further says:
The foundation of NATO, on which
alone a strong superstructure can be
built, is the political obligation that its
members have taken for collective
defence: to consider that an attack on one
is an attack on all which will be met by
the collective action of all. There is a
tendency at times to overlook the farreaching importance of this commitment,
especially during those periods when the
danger of having to invoke it may seem
to recede.
I would particularly draw attention to that
last phrase "especially during those periods
when the danger of having to invoke it may
seem to recede." These are the words of Mr.
Pearson and others in 1956. Again the report
says:
This is our best present deterrent
against military aggression, and consequently the best assurance that the commitment undertaken will not be engaged.
This refers of course to the fact that if the
deterrent is strong enough we have a good
chance of preventing war.
Referring to the question of close unity, I
quote again from the report where it says:
-this close unity was both natural and
desirable; that the common cultural traditions, free institutions and democratic
concepts which were being challenged,
and were marked for destruction by
those who challenged them, were things
which should also bring the NATO
nations closer together, not only for their
defence but for their development.
Meanwhile some of the immediate
fears of large-scale all-out military
aggression against Western Europe have
lessened. This process has been facilitated
by evidence that the Soviet Government
have realized that any such all-out
aggression would be met by a sure, swift
and devastating retaliation-

SENATE DEBATES
I believe that that justification of NATO is
as true today as it was when Mr. Pearson
signed that report. Honourable senators will
note that all the elements we have discussed
today in respect to NATO, regardless of
whether one is for or against it, are to be
found in the quotations I have read. They
point out that peaceful co-existence is a possibility if we are strong enough on our side.
The report refers to the danger of complacency if western nations should be lulled or mesmerized to a degree of complacency which
would fit in with the plans of the would-be
aggressors. It reminds us of the continuing
threat and the importance of the deterrent
role.
Honourable senators, I have referred to Mr.
St. Laurent and Mr. Pearson and naturally I
should mention the role of another great
Canadian, Mr. Diefenbaker, who not only
supported and extended the policy adopted by
Mr. St. Laurent and Mr. Pearson but, on a
certain historic occasion at the specific
request of the Prime Minister of Great Britain and the President of the United States,
stood up in the United Nations Assembly and
challenged the leader of the USSR to his face
to free the 123 million non-Russians behind
the Iron Curtain.
The third assertion is that it is NATO and
NATO alone that has kept the peace, stopping
the aggression dead and establishing the front
line, making it clear that the nations on our
side, the nations who might be the victims of
aggression, are prepared, and not only are
they prepared but they are determined that
they will be seen to be prepared.
We hear a good deal about preparedness
and armaments, about the readiness to defend
ourselves-as causes of maintaining the tension that may lead to war. Surely, if history
means anything, the very opposite is true:
NATO's defence deterrents have led to a
détente. Reading the history of those days, I
wonder if anybody would seriously doubt that
Soviet imperialism would have rolled westwards over other countries had NATO not
been established at that time. I have no
doubts at all on that score. Further, I find it
impossible to follow the reasoning of people
who say, "NATO created the détente; the
détente is here; now we do not need NATO."
That is reducing the argument to as strange an
absurdity as I have ever heard in any
argument.
On the contrary, the evidence is abundant-Senator Yuzyk spelled it out, as I men[Hon. Mr. Grosart.]

December 4, 1969

tioned-that the aims of the Soviets continue
to be aggression, aggression everywhere.
Again, as Senator Yuzyk pointed out, they
made it clear that part of their strategy is to
lull the rest of the world into complacency.
They pretend the détente is something they
invented. Surely, NATO is the reason why
there is a détente, and if NATO is weakened,
then we can be sure that will be the end of
the détente.
NATO has had some accomplishments that
it is very difficult to imagine would have been
achieved without NATO. West Germany
might and almost certainly would be behind
the iron curtain. Honourable senators will
recall that the blockade of West Berlin was
unsuccessful because NATO was there. The
attempts to take over Greece and Iran failed
because NATO was there to see that they
failed; and the Berlin Wall, as an honourable
senator mentioned the other day, is there to
make clear to the world the contrast between
life on that side of the iron curtain and on
our side. My final assertion is that the day
may and probably will come when NATO
will be much more important to Canada than
Canada is to NATO. What are the alternatives to preparedness being suggested by
those who support the downgrading of our
role in NATO? They say we can confine our
defence lines to Canada, that we can protect
ourselves. This has been said, sometimes with
the rider: "with the help of the Americans." I
wonder if anyone really believes that. One
wonders what use ground defence forces
would be in Canada in the event of an attack.
It seems fairly clear from the evidence we
have that the only answer to an attack is
from launching pad to launching pad. In the
foreseeable future Canada is not going to
have the capability of matching the missile
launchings that would come over the North
Pole.
We are also told-and this is the subject of
a book published just last week-that we can
defend ourselves and save ourselves from
attack by becoming neutral, that we can opt
out of the world. You sometimes hear it postand
about Switzerland
"What
ulated,
Sweden? They have managed to do it. Cannot
we do it?" The fact of the matter is that,
apart from great differences in geographical
location, Sweden and Switzerland are also
just about the two most heavily armed
nations in the world. That is the price they
pay for neutrality. The suggestion we hear in
Canada is that we can be neutral without
being armed to the teeth. It is impossible.

SENATE DEBATES

December 4, 1969

The final suggestion I hear is: Let us be
isolationists until we are attacked, and then
we will do something about it. Surely, it
would be too late for that. No one likes an
isolationist, and if we isolated ourselves from
the world, from our commitments in the free
world, I, for one, fear we would find ourselves
sorrowfully isolated at the time of attack.
It seems to me that such assumptions are
founded on two generalities which are not
true. One is that the Soviets want peaceful
co-existence within the present boundaries,
the lines now drawn-the NATO front line
and others. My first answer is that there is
not a jot or tittle of evidence that I can find
to support that view. Even were it true, could
Canada really seriously put itself in the position of saying, "We do not care about the 113
million behind the Iron Curtain, and we will
leave them there; it is their hard luck; that is
the way the war wound up, and that is the
way Soviet aggression wound up three years
after the war"? Can any Canadian really say
that we will abandon them to their fate? On
the contrary, surely a strong NATO front line
is in the long run the only hope these
enslaved millions have that they will ever
enjoy the freedom of the western nations.
In making these comments on what appears
to be our NATO policy, I am using it really as
a symbol of what appears to me to be a
symptom of the very serious illness of some
Canadians, and that is the disease of
isolationism.
The Round Table, a publication not
unfriendly to Canada, had this to say in a
leading editorial in the July issue:
As the Americans sort out their priorities, the British and Canadian governments are showing them a poor lead.
Both are withdrawing narrowly into their
continents... The Canadian government
has proclaimed a diminished interest in

da's Cheaper Ride in World Affairs," which
documents some of the comment that is being
made abroad. Perhaps I may read a few
random passages:
They (the Europeans) nevertheless express
regret that Canada is losing interest in
their continent and weakening its voice
in matters vital to world security.
This regret turns to astonishment, and
even annoyance, when it is noted that
Canadian spokesmen deny that we are
weakening our support for the Atlantic
Alliance and say that we intend to
increase our political role in Europe
while drastically cutting our military presence. Not without reason, the Europeans
refuse to be persuaded that Canadian
troops contribute as much to general
security, or to détente, when removed to
the other side of the Atlantic-especially
now that it is known that the overall
strength of the Canadian forces is to be
reduced substantially. Since Canada is
violating the club rules by slashing its
military contribution, unilaterally and
without compelling reason, the other
NATO members consider preposterous
the demand that our views should be
accorded the same hearing as in the past.
Hon. Mr. Smith: May I ask the honourable
senator who is the author of this? I did not
catch the name.

apparently proposing to retire into
North American isolation which was
once the pride of the United States and
the scorn of Canada.

Hon. Mr. Grosari: The author is a former
member of the Department of External
Affairs, Peyton V. Lyon, who is now chairman of the Department of Political Science,
Carleton University.
Professor Lyon makes other comments,
such as:
Canada's military withdrawal is weakening our diplomacy on precisely the sort of
question on which we like to be taken
nuclear
most seriously-disarmament,
contingency planning and east-west
relations.

So our scorn of the past bas, in some parts of
Canada, apparently become our pride of the
present.
I said that there is considerable evidence of
a loss of prestige abroad, and widespread
comment thereon. Honourable senators may
be interested in reading the current issue of
The CanadianBanker which contains an article written by Peyton Lyon entitled: "Cana-

Peyton suggests, and I agree with him, that
we just cannot have it both ways. International relations are not that simplistic.

And, again:

Hon. Mr. Grosart: I will re-read it:

Hon. Mr. Lamontagne: I know.
Hon. Mr. Grosart:

Hon. Mr. Grosari: I would have some
doubts. I share Professor Lyon's sarcasm, but
I would be inclined to include France. Perhaps honourable senators will allow me to
conclude and summarize my remarks by a
short quotation from the Report of the Committee of Three, signed by Mr. Pearson. I
believe these words are as truc today as they
were when he wrote them:
The fundamental historical fact underlying development is that the nation
state, by itself and relying exclusively on
national policy and national power, is
inadequate for progress or even for survival in the nuclear age. As the founders
of the North Atlantic Treaty foresaw, the
growing interdependence of states, politically and economically as well as
militarily, calls for an ever-increasing
measure of international cohesion and cooperation. Some states may be able to
enjoy a degree of political and economic
independence when things are going well.
No state, however powerful, can guarantee its security and its welfare by national action alone.
Hon. Paul Martin: Honourable senators, I
think we have every reason to be grateful to
Senator McDonald for initiating this discussion. I am of the view that these are vital
matters in connection with which the Senate
has a responsibility. The speeches of the participants in this debate, from the time it
began with Senator McDonald's speech, have
been of a very high order. The speech to
[Hon. Mr. Grosart.]

December 4, 1969

which we have just listened is not one with
which I fully agree, but I do commend the
industry and the zeal of Senator GrosartHon. Mr. Roebuck: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Martin:-in this, and in other
fields of endeavour in which he is engaged as
a member of this house.
I well remember the speech made by Senator Grosart's seatmate, Senator O'Leary, on
NATO and Canadian policy in regard thereto.
It was a speech that I do not think would
meet with Senator Grosart's full accord, but
it did great credit to the Senate. It was delivered by Senator O'Leary in his powerful
style, and it added to the richness of our
debate and the debating capacity of this
chamber.
I do not agree with Senator Grosart that
the results of the Government's reappraisal of
its NATO policy means a downgrading by the
Government of NATO. I do not agree that the
announcement of the policy by the Prime
Minister on April 3 last could in any way be
regarded as a drift towards isolationism.
Senator Grosart listed four important postulates, as he saw them, the final one of which,
if I correctly understood it, provided that
NATO remains essential to the defence of
this country. There is nothing in the statement of policy of the Government, as announced on April 3, that would be contradictory to this statement. Nor is there anything in the Government's revised NATO
policy which would warrant the view that the
Government is moving toward neutrality for
Canada. The Government has never said that
it was possible or desirable for Canada to be
neutral. The statement of Government policy
made by the Prime Minister provided for our
continued membership in NATO, and our
support for the principle of collective security
embodied in the charter of NATO itself.
The Prime Minister went on in that statement to say that Canada was opposed to a
policy of isolationism. He also said that Canada is opposed to a policy of non-alignment.
He made the very necessary distinction between neutralism and non-alignment. It could
have been argued that because we were making a reassessment of policy it amounted to a
neutralist policy. The Government was careful in affirming its belief in NATO to say that
at the same time it did not support for Canada a policy of neutralism or of non-alignment.

Decemnber 4, 1969

SENATE DEBATES

The Government recognizes that its security depends on a peaceful world. One of our
-main national objectives must therefore be to
contribute, as the Government is doing, to the
prevention of nuclear war and to the promotion of peace. The Government does propose
to loosen itself of its nuclear responsibility. It
continues to believe that the prevention of
nuclear war and the promotion of peace depend on a peaceful world. Canada wishes to
contribute as a member of the United Nations
and within the provisions, as Senator Grosart
said, of Article 51 of the Charter, as a
member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization with which Canada has had so much
to do through the initiatives of Mr. St. Laurent and Mr. Pearson.
Our decision last spring to reaffirm our
membership in the North Atlantic Alliance
was based on the view that NATO, and
Canada within it, have a significant role to
play in the preservation and promotion of
peace. I have indicated what that decision
was and I repeat it: it was to continue as a
member of NATO, at the same time affirming
our opposition to neutralism and to non-alignment. The decision to reduce our forces in
Europe to approximately half the current
level by next year was taken in the light of
the remarkable economic progress of the
western European countries in recent years.
Another factor was the change in their ability
to provide the necessary defence forces.
A relevant point is that Canada, unlike
most other members of NATO, has been bearing a significant defence burden on two continents. It should not be forgotten that valuable
partners in NATO, such as Italy, Norway,
Holland, Denmark and France, do not have
forces outside the continent of Europe. Of the
countries I have mentioned, only France has
troops stationed outside her borders, in
nearby Germany. There are no forces of other
countries outside their own borders.
In appraising the contribution that Canada
bas made and which its government, after
reappraisal of its foreign policy, has made,
recognition should be given to the continued
contribution we are making militarily and
otherwise to NATO. We have reduced our
military presence in Europe, but we continue
to maintain a substantial military presence
there. Our present view is that not only do
we regard NATO as essential from a military
point of view, but we regard it as having an
important political role. This is one of the

reasons we continue to participate in the organization. Not only do we recognize its political role, but we recognize that NATO can
be and has been a forum for the examination
of arms control and disarmament measures
and the harmonization of Canadian views in
connection therewith. This is a very important
point, particularly at the present time when
we are considering the Helsinki conference
which is now under way, involving discussions between the two great powers, the Soviet Union and the United States.
We continue to be a member of NATO. We
regard Article 2 as having a continued significance in the Alliance. I noted with interest
what Senator Grosart had to say about Article
2, which was placed in the treaty as a result
of the initiative taken by the former Prime
Minister, Mr. Pearson.
In fulfilment of our undertaking to take
account of the views of our allies in bringing
about a planned and phased reduction in
Europe, we conducted extensive consultations
in NATO during the summer concerning our
proposals. During these consultations we reaffirmed our intention to meet responsibly our
collective security obligations under the
North Atlantic Treaty and to continue to play
an active and constructive role in support of
the values which we share with our allies. We
have been assured by the NATO military
authorities that, notwithstanding our reduction, the over 5,000 man force which will
remain in Europe will be able to play a
meaningful part in the alliance's defence
effort.
Hon. Mr. Grosart: Would the honourable
Leader of the Government permit a question?
Has the Canadian Government given the
NATO alliance any assurance as to the length
of time it will continue the Canadian military
presence in Europe?
Hon. Mr. Martin: No. The forces levels are
fixed by each country for one year at a tirne.
No country would give that oommitment and
no country has ever been asked to give it.
The Ministers of Defence meet each December, as they are doing this very week in
Brussels, to determine the force levels.
From the military point of view, NATO's
continued importance lies in its stabilizing
influence and in the fact that it reduces the
possibility of a major conflict originating in
Europe. The United States and the Soviet
Union have vital interests in the area. Accordingly, any outbreak there could readily

SENATE DEBATES

escalate into a world nuclear struggle. However, the danger of nuclear war can only be
permanently reduced if solutions can be found
for underlying political issues which create
east-west tensions. Significant progress toward arms control and disarmament is also
necessary. It is for that reason that the Government welcomes discussions currently under
way in Helsinki between the two great powers, who are meeting primarily to discuss
strategie arms limitation possibilities.
So it follows that one of the most compelling reasons why Canada remains a member
of NATO-and it is important to note that is
the fact, that we continue to remain a member of NATO, without reservation-is the
importance we attach to the political role of
the alliance in furthering an accommodation
with the Warsaw Pact countries on political
problems and promoting agreement on arms
control. Certainly the Government takes the
position that the meaning of Article 51 of the
Charter of the United Nations presupposes
that regional organizations are not necessarily
immortal. If we are to have peace in Europe,
peace in the world, the time must be reached
when we will be able to work out some accommodation with the Warsaw Pact countries.
This is the view of every member in NATO.
Senator Grosart spoke of détente. No one
bas been more interested in pursuing détente
than the Canadian Government, both the
present and the former government. Some
progress in détente has been made. But it
would be imprudent, I think, to conclude that
we have reached the final stages of the removal of strain between east and west. The
fact is that in the promotion of détente we
and the other members of the alliance wish
to encourage gradual and co-ordinated development of contacts with the Warsaw Pact
countries to establish the mutual confidence
necessary for the settlement of political
issues. The alliance, as distinguished from the
organization-because this includes the 15
countries, that is to say, France and the other
14-has publicly indicated its desire to
explore with these countries concrete issues
that would be most appropriate for fruitful
negotiation and early resolution.
On the arms control side, the Government
believes that NATO is important in several
respects. It is the forum where the United
States has consulted with Canada and the
other countries in preparation for the vital
strategic arms limitations talks that have
[Hon. Mr. Martin.]

December 4, 1969

begun in Helsinki. We have encouraged
these consultations, and also the important
exchanges of view that take place within
NATO on other aspects of arms control and
disarmament, such as the peaceful use of the
seabed and the prohibition of chemical and
biological warfare.
The other day the President of the United
States made a very important commitment
with regard to biological warfare. That commitment was one that in its principal terms
was the subject matter of discussion by
NATO partners. This illustrates the value of
the continuous series of talks that goes on all
year at NATO between the representatives of
the various countries who compose the membership of the organization.
Another arms control subject on which
NATO has been pursuing intensive studies is
the proposal for mutual and balanced force
reductions in Europe, which the alliance publicly suggested in June 1968, and which it had
urged in 1966 and 1967, but to which the
Soviet bloc has unfortunately not yet reacted.
A significant new dimension, one that
greatly interests Canada and is another
reason for our continued membership in the
organization, is indicated by the recent decision of NATO, supported of course by
Canada, to establish a committee on the Challenges of Modern Society, to consider problems of human environment, and to improve
the exchange of views and experiences among
member countries in this increasingly important field.
Article 2 of the treaty provides:
The Parties will contribute toward
the further development of peaceful
and friendly international relations, by
strengthening their free institutions, by
bringing about a better understanding of
the principles upon which these institutions are founded, and by promoting conditions of stability and well-being. They
will seek to eliminate conflict in their
international economic policies and will
encourage economic collaboration between any or all of them.
Mr. Pearson was perbaps more responsible
than anyone else for the inclusion of this
article in the treaty. It was with the greatest
disappointment that Canadian governments,
including the government of Mr. Diefenbaker,
at every ministerial meeting did not find
favourable reaction to the implications of
this article, particularly by the Government
of the United States. Mr. Foster Dulles was
a great student of international affairs. He

December 4, 1969

SENATE DEBATES

was a very important Secretary of State in
the United States. But I believe history will
show that it was as a result of his leadership
that not much was forthcoming to give meaning and substance to this article. However,
President Nixon may have taken an initiative
that represents a reversal of official United
States policy in this regard.
In furtherance of its aim of establishing a
just and lasting peace in Europe, NATO
decided at its ministerial meeting last April
that a list of the issues which appeared ripest
for negotiation with the western pact countries should now be drafted. It also directed
that a study should be made of how a useful
process of negotiation could be best initiated.
On the basis of the work undertaken in
NATO since the last ministerial meeting in
April, the meeting now in session in Brussels
is considering what further steps should be
taken to further not only the cause of détente
but to give meaning to President Nixon's initiative. We will lend full support to developments in this regard, as we have all along, in
trying to further dialogue between east and
west. It seems to me difficult to understand
how anyone can suggest that this dialogue
should not be pursued.
During the April NATO ministerial meeting
in Washington, President Nixon proposed that
NATO:
Create a committee on the challenges
of modern society to explore ways in
which the experience and resources of
the western nations could most effectively be marshalled toward improving the
quality of life of our peoples.
I believe that during the first 20 years the
success of NATO in the two areas of collective security and political consultation is
reflected in the creation of a third dimension.
It will receive even greater support now as a
result of this new mission.
Mr. Patrick Moynihan, President Nixon's
senior adviser on social questions, described
in the following terms what the President had
in mind. He said:
The "challenges of modern society" are to
find ways to minimize the harmful effects
that arise from imperfect use of technological developments, to achieve a more
effective use of technology and more
humane forms of complex systems with a
view to enhancing the welfare and freedom of individuals and strengthening the
basis of world peace.

At the April meeting the NATO ministers
agreed, and this included Mr. Sharp, the
Secretary of State for External Affairs, that
the United States proposal was worthy of further consideration. In their communiqué they
instructed the permanent council to examine
how to improve the exchange of views and
experiences among allied countries in the task
of creating a better environment for their
societies. A permanent NATO Committee on
the Challenges of Modern Society, therefore,
has been established. This is a great change
in United States policy and in the opportunity
now open to NATO.
Environmental problems, with their related
economic, legal and social implications, which
are of growing concern to Canada and other
countries, may now be part of the workload
of NATO. Every avenue which might assist in
finding solutions in these areas should be pursued. It may be that this will be one of the
really effective ways of bringing about peace
and stability in Europe.
One could not deny that much valuable
work is already being done in these areas by
the U.N. and the O.E.C.D., but I would observe that no one organization could hope to
supply all the answers.
We have been one of the chief proponents
of non-military co-operation in NATO. It
would therefore seem appropriate for us to
support an extension of NATO's interest to
an area which will be of growing importance
to its members in the 1970s. Because NATO's
members include many of the world's most
developed countries, they necessarily have a
community of interest in terms of environmental problems, which have already been
referred to in this house by Senator Macnaughton in the initiative he took the other
day. Canada should be able to both benefit
from this NATO activity and, I would hope,
make a contribution to it.
The role envisaged for NATO, as I understand President Nixon's proposal, is primarily
that of a forum or the exchange of information and experiences among member countries on environmental questions. The alliance
itself, essentially a military alliance, would
not attempt to carry out the scientific work.
NATO activity would centre on an openended committee of high-level experts who
would meet periodically during the course of
a calendar year.
The Government has authorized Mr. Campbell, the Canadian permanent representative
to the North Atlantic Council, to support the
establishment of the proposed NATO Com-

SENATE DEBATES

mittee on the Challenges of Modern Society. I
believe the first meeting of the permanent
committee will take place from December 8 to
18 in Brussels.
I had emphasized the proposal of Mr.
Nixon, because of the Government's continued support for NATO, as another reason
for the position we took as announced by the
Prime Minister on April 3. There is nothing
isolationist in the Government's policy. There
was certainly no basis for suggestion that it
was a trend toward neutralism, because in
the announcement of the policy he indicated
that in our support for collective security, as
represented by NATO, we were opposed to a
policy of neutralism, as we were to a policy
of non-alignment. The fact that we gave
emphasis to the importance of continental
defence in no way abridges our support for
the concept and for the nature of the organization which we helped to bring into being.
The reduction of our military commitment
was not a precedent. It is not the first time
countries have taken action by bringing about
a reduction in their military contribution. We
ourselves, during the time that I was Secretary of State for External Affairs, reduced
our contribution. It is true that we did not
carry out the policy until we had had consultations. It is also a fact that the governments
of Great Britain and the United States, in
consultation with the government of the Federal Republic of Germany, because of problems in regard to balance of payments, did
take initiatives that led to reductions. What is
significant is that we continue to support the
organization. We have not changed our policy,
but what we have done is to reduce our military commitment by half.
This is the result of a reappraisal by the
Government of its foreign policy in this particular area. It is not the first time the Government has reappraised its foreign policy. I
may say that a year before I retired from the
office of Secretary of State for External Affairs, I caused a reappraisal of many aspects
of our foreign policy. Foreign policy must be
continuously under examination and re-examination. There is nothing static in a policy
underlying the attitude of one country toward
other countries. Changes are the very nature
of human life. As Bacon said, "There is the
graduai unfolding of an idea in human affairs." And so it is in the life of a government
and its policies.
[Hon. Mr. Martin.]

December 4, 1969

The reappraisal that took place during the
Pearson Government was a reappraisal by the
Government itself. The reappraisal by the
Government was in relation to a section of
the public. This was an advance over the
reassessment made by the Pearson Government of this and other aspects of Canadian
foreign policy. I see no reason whatsoever for
concluding that the Government of Canada,
as presently constituted, recognizes less than
any other nation its responsibilities to our
interdependent world community.
Our emphasis on external aid, the increased
allocations, the additional funds that are
gradually being provided to assist the underdeveloped people of the world, the new emphasis on continental defence, the new emphasis on the need to defend our national
sovereignty-these are not in themselves
inconsistent with our obligations to the world
community, to NATO, or to the United
Nations.
Hon. Mr. Grosari: Would the honourable
senator permit a question? Would he not
agree, since he bas mentioned our commitments under CIDA, that we have completely
reneged on the undertaking, which he himself
gave, to reach by 1970 the U.N. target of one
per cent of G.N.P. for our development aid?
Hon. Mr. Martin: It is true that in the
Pearson Government we did hope to reach
one per cent of the G.N.P. by early 1970-71,
but whether or not we do, the fact is that
more and more money is being allocatedmore this year than last year-and the result
will be that by 1970-71 more moneys will
have been allocated for development in the
underdeveloped countries than heretofore.
The Prime Minister was quite frank. He
said that we have economic problems at
home. We have to face the problem of eliminating budgetary deficits and attaining budgetary surpluses. To meet those objectives there
have to be modifications. The fact is, as he
said, that while every department of government has been the subject of retrenchmentHon. Mr. Grosart: Except one.
Hon. Mr. Martin: -the
one area where
there has been no retrenchment in total dollar
terms is in the field of external aid.
Honourable senators, in answer to those
who have spoken before, I say that the Government need not apologize for its policy on

December 4, 1969

SENATE DEBATES

NATO. There are many people in the country
who would have us withdraw from NATO. I
myself faced an audience of some 3,000 students at the University of Alberta a week ago
Monday. There I was confronted with an
overwhelming expression of view that this is
what Canada should do, supported by four
eminent panelists who supported this position
of the students.
We are now engaged in a healthy dialogue
in this country. There is more interest in foreign policy. It is being publicly debated more
than at any other time. This is all to the good.
However, the fact is that the Government of
the day has a responsibility; and I believe
that this Government has discharged its responsibility and its obligations under NATO
in a way which warrants the support of Parliament and the people of Canada.

not become scraps of paper when it suited
Russia's policy to disregard them? I would
like the honourable leader to elaborate on
this, but if he cannot do so now he could do it
at some convenient time.
Hon. Mr. Martin: I do have to catch a
plane, and will not answer the senator's question as fully as I would wish.
The treaty provides that in 1969 any country may give notice of intention to withdraw.
No country has taken advantage of the provisions of the treaty. That includes Canada.
That is the only reply one can make.
I have given indications today of the strong
support we have for the alliance and for the
principle of collective security. I will look at
other aspects of the question which Senator
Carter has raised. These matters are too important to be answered loosely.
I wish to emphasize that our position with
regard to notice is no different from that of
any other country. We have not taken advantage of the provisions regarding 1969. We
affirmed through the Prime Minister on April
3 our intention to continue as a member of
the organization.
What the future holds, no one can tell. I
would hope that the day will come when we
can rely on the provisions of the Charter of
the United Nations. We would never have
proposed NATO, if it had not been for the
fact that in 1947 the Honourable Louis St.
Laurent and Senator Vandenberg and others
felt that there was no guarantee for security
for the western world under the provisions of
the Charter, because of the intransigence of
the Soviet Union in particular, regarding
Article 43 of the Charter of the United
Nations.
I would despair if I thought for one
moment that the new world was going to
have to be divided into two armed camps,
such as we have now. The reason we are pursuing policies of détente in NATO, the reason
we are eagerly grasping the opportunity of
giving some effect to Article 2 is that we look
for the period when the emphasis can be on
non-military instead of military co-operation.
But the Government has taken a position in a
statement made by the Prime Minister on
April 3.

Hon. Mr. Carter: I want to put two questions to the honourable leader.
First, I would like to ask him if he would
be good enough to elaborate on the reply he
gave to Senator Grosart about the Government's future position with respect to NATO.
I think much of our confusion arises from the
fact that the statement made by the Prime
Minister does not commit Canada to remain
in NATO any longer than the end of 1970.
As I understand it, the original members
were committed for a twenty-year period and
when that expired they were free to review.
Has anything been done to make the commitment for a further period of three or four
years? No question of uncertainty has arisen
in respect to any other NATO member except
Canada. That seems to stem from two factsthat we have withdrawn part of our force or
plan to withdraw it, and we have not given
any commitment beyond one year. That leads
many people to think that the withdrawal of
forces is the first step leading to total withdrawal. I would like the honourable leader to
elaborate on that.
My second question relates to the détente.
If we work out a détente with the Warsaw
Pact nations, what value would it have?
Soviet Russia had an agreement with Czechoslovakia but when Czechoslovakia began
moving towards a freer society and a better
relationship with the western countries,
which Soviet Russia interpreted as interfering
with its policy, then Soviet Russia had no
compunction in walking in.
Hon. Mr. Lamontagne: Mr. Speaker, in
If we work out these agreements, what
guarantee would there be? What basis is order to pursue this dialogue referred to by
there for believing that they in turn would the Leader of the Government, I should like

JUSTICE
COMBINES INVESTIGATION OF PUBLISHING
BUSINESS IN NEW BRUNSWICKINQUIRY ANSWERED
Hon. J. Campbell Haig inquired of the Government, pursuant to notice:
(1) Under what section of the Combines
Investigation Act was an inquiry instituted into the publishing business in New
Brunswick?
(2) Who submitted the complaint and
on what date?
(3) What action bas been taken to date
and by whom was such action taken?
(4) Has the inquiry been completed
and, if not, when is the report expected?
Hon. Paul Martin: Answered.
(The answer follows)
(1), (2), and (3). The long standing practice, as explained by the Minister of Justice in the House of Commons on November 23, 1964, concerning inquiries under
the Combines Investigation Act, is that no
information is given out about an inquiry
unless or until a report is made by the
Restrictive Trade Practices Commission
or some other public action is taken pursuant to the statute. In the present case,
certain action taken by the staff of the
Director of Investigation and Research
was publicized by some of the people
under investigation. In this case, the
Director bas informed the Minister that,
having reason to believe that the Act had
been or was about to be violated, he
applied to the Restrictive Trade Practices
Commission for a certificate allowing him
to exercise the power of entry and search
provided under section 10 of the Combines Investigation Act. This he did
in accordance with the statutory duty
imposed upon him by section 8(b) of the
Act. In accordance with the practice
referred to, however, it would not be
proper to disclose further details.
(4). No. Under the Act the Director has
several courses open to him during or on
the completion of his inquiry. He may
[Hon. Mr. Smith.]

refer a statement of the evidence to the
Restrictive Trade Practices Commission
and to the parties under section 18 or to
the Attorney General of Canada under
section 15, or he may discontinue the
inquiry under section 14. In the latter
event, the discontinuance would be
reported to the Minister of Consumer and
Corporate Affairs and the parties concerned would be informed of the
discontinuance.

INTER-PARLIAMENTARY

UNION

FIFTY-SEVENTH ANNUAL CONFERENCE HELD
AT NEW DELHI, INDIA-VISIT BY
DELEGATION TO CEYLON

The Senate resumed from Thursday,
December 4, the debate on the inquiry of
Hon. Mr. Carter calling the attention of the
Senate to the visit to Ceylon of the delegation
from Canada to the Fifty-Seventh Annual
Conference of the Inter-Parliamentary Union.
Hon. Edgar Fournier: Honourable senators,
tonight I will probably make the shortest
speech of my life.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Fournier (Madawaska-Restigouche): Recently I returned, along with a few
of my colleagues,
from a long trip
which took us to Israel, India and Ceylon, a
small portion of Egypt, and Italy, including
Rome. I feel somewhat like the astronauts
returning from the moon to earth-I ask
myself whether it is true that I was really
there.
My reasons for adding a few words to what

has been said so eloquently by Senator Carter
in his explanation of the whole trip are
simply that I wish to pay tribute to certain
people, especially Mr. J. Timmerman, the
Canadian High Commissioner in Ceylon, his
charming wife, and his staff. I wish to thank
especially Miss Margaret Cathy, the secretary
of the staff, who spared no effort in preparing
our trip, and making it pleasant and easy for
everybody.

December 9, 1969

SENATE DEBATES

I endorse al the statements made by Senator Carter with respect to this trip. It is obvious that he put both time and effort into
preparing such a complete report.
It is truly said that, in its natural setting,
Ceylon is a very interesting country. Being so
close to the equator, it has the world's most
beautiful sunsets. Incidentally, I managed to
take quite a few pictures of those beautiful
sunsets, and I assure you they are really
something to behold.
Despite the completeness of Senator Carter's report, I wish to mention two points that
he omitted and which I feel are of real interest-at least, they are to me as an old senator.
Those two aspects are liquor and women.
However, I shall deal with these subjects
briefly. Taking liquor first of all, I would
mention that because the religion there is
largely Islam, the people do not drink much
hard liquor. Another reason, perhaps, is that
they do not have the money with which to
buy it. However, as I say, they do not drink
hard liquor to any extent. I wish I could say
the same about my own country. Mainly, they
drink water and a small amount of beer
made in Ceylon, or soft drinks.
So far as the women are concerned, they
are very beautiful, with their brownish tan
and wearing maxi dress. They go in very
much for colours, and have a charming personality. I might add that the miniskirt is
very seldom seen in Ceylon.
We have talked about the dangers of infection from the bite of the mosquito there. Perhaps there would be a greater incidence of
these bites if the women were to wear miniskirts rather than maxiskirts-the male mosquito could be of some embarrassment.
We also had the opportunity of talking to
some industrialists in Ceylon about the
Colombo Plan. They told us, "We don't need
any assistance from Canada; all we ask you
to do is buy our tea." I discussed this subject
with them for quite some time, and I found
that they were indeed sincere in their view.
They told us that Ceylon produces the best
tea in the world, but they cannot put it on the
market because it goes from Ceylon to
London where it is blended with other teas.
For that reason we never drink pure Ceylon
tea.
Honourable senators, during this trip I was
fortunate enough to have the opportunity to
take a number of colour slides, and I hope in
the near future to be able to show them to
honourable senators who would like to see
21498-20

them. They will help to explain in a little
more detail what we have been talking about
in the course of this debate.
NORTH ATLANTIC ASSEMBLY
FIFTEENTH

ANNUAL

CONFERENCE AT

BRUSSELS, BELGIUM-DEBATE
CONTINUED
The Senate resumed from Thursday,
December 4, the adjourned debate on the
inquiry of Hon. Mr. McDonald, calling the
attention of the Senate to the Fifteenth
Annual Conference of the North Atlantic
Assembly, held at Brussels, Belgium, 16th to
21st October, 1969, and in particular to the
discussions and the proceedings of the Conference and the participation therein of the
delegation from Canada, and to the visit of
the delegation from Canada to NATO Bases
in Europe.
Hon. Maurice Lamontagne: Honourable
senators, I decided to speak for the first time
in this chamber on international affairs when
the Government Leader expressed the hope
last Thursday that more of us would participate in the debate initiated by Senator
McDonald.
I have already expressed elsewhere the
views which I propose to submit to you this
evening. I do not apologize for this, because if
there were no such repetition, the debates on
foreign affairs would be much less frequent
than they are. Moreover, I have the impression of representing the views of the growing
minority which have not been expressed
before this house, at least in the terms which
I intend to use.
Let us say that I represent tonight, on this
most important matter, the opinion of the
silent minority, which can be described as the
left wing of the Liberal party.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: In external affairs?
Hon. Mr. Lamontagne: Yes, on external
affairs. Senator Grosart and others have
spoken on behalf of the small "c" conservatives. The Government Leader has put forward the case of the big "L" Liberals. I
propose to speak on behalf of the smal "1"
liberals.
[Translation]
First of all, I would like to give a brief
summary of my argument by quoting part of
a speech I made in the great town of Outremont on February 2, 1967, a long time

SENATE DEBATES
before the Canadian Government decided to
redefine the part it plays within NATO.
I stated at the time:
The era of prosperity that the industrialized countries are experiencing brings out
in sharper contrast the poverty and
hunger to be found in the economically
under-developed ones. It bas become
urgent, in the name of the most elementary humanitarianism and in the West's
own best interest, to promote on a much
larger scale the economic development of
those countries. For those reasons,
Canada should reduce its military participation to regional alliances. This change
should not be inspired by an illusory
neutralism, nor should it lead to a reduction in our international commitments,
but rather to an increase in our aid to
developing countries. Briefly, this means
that we should substitute to a marginal
military role, of which our allies are less
and less in need, a helping role that we
are often in a better position than they
are to fulfil adequately.
[English]

This is the general thesis that I developed
last June in Toronto, and I intend to restate it
tonight so that it will be part of our record. If
it sounds too academic for some, I hope that
you will forgive me on the ground that I am
still a university teacher.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: I would suggest you make
it very skilful, because it avoids the issue.
Hon. Mr. Lamontagne: I think the Leader
of the Opposition may rest completely at ease,
because I will not avoid the issue.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: I am sure you will.
Hon. Mr. Lamontagne: During the past few
months Canada has been reassessing her role
in NATO amd her approach to foreign aid.
After more than twenty years of experience
in these two fields, it was highly desirable to
review what we have been doing and, more
particularly, what we are going to do in the
light of the international outlook, and also in
the light of our own position in the world.
In the recent debate it appears to me that a
concensus has developed in Canada on at
least three aspects of our international
involvement. First, our financial contribution
to military alliances and our external aid program are viewed, rightly, in my opinion, as
alternative methods of participation in international affairs. I will have more to say about
this later.
[Hon. Mr. Lamontagne.]

December 9, 1969

Secondly, Canadians would like to contribute more to international development. Thirdly, the neutralist position has never had fewer
supporters in Canada. Canadians do not
always approve what the Americans are
doing, but they definitely feel that they
belong to the Western world. Thus, there is
no popular demand for leaving NATO or for
refusing to participate in the North American
defence system.
On the other hand, I believe that there
would be strong opposition in Canada if the
Government were to increase simultaneously
its military expenditures abroad and its
external aid. There would then not be enough
money left to solve urgent domestic problems.
It is within this context of general consensus
that real disagreement arises in Canada concerning our international involvement. There
are those who would like our country to
maintain its past role in NATO. This would
mean growing expenditures in that sector,
even without greater commitments, with the
rising cost of equipment and armaments,
which are becoming obsolete at a faster rate
than ever before. This would almost inevitably prevent us from substantialiy improving
our participation in international development.
There are other Canadians who would like
to see our external aid increased rapidly. This
would certainly mean that we would not be
able financially to renew the military commitments we now have in NATO. The debate on
Canada's international involvement is not, of
course, always carried out in those terms, but
I suggest that for the next few years at least
these are the only two realistic alternatives
that Canadians can afford to face if they do
not want to neglect unduly their other national goals.
As far as I am concerned, I favour the
second alternative. I belong to the second
group which I have described, and I intend to
justify my position. In so doing I would like
first to deal with the changing international
situation.
Since the late 1940's international conditions have changed substantially on several
fronts. The three most spectacular changes
have been the closing of the ideological gap
between the so-called Soviet Bloc and Western countries; secondly, the widening development gap between the pre-industrial nations
and the post-industrial societies, and the rapid
rise of Red China as a world power.

December 9, 1969

Decemer 9,1969SENATE
DEBATES

This is wbere my lecture begins. The closing ideolo.cical gap between East and West is
flot a new phenomenon. 1 referred to it in
1953 in a speech entitled "The Future Raie of
Gavernment."' This most important evolution
took the audience by surprise when I
described it 16 years ago in Quebec City. It is
stili puzzling the Marxists. What happened
was that Marx misled bath his followers and
bis opponents. It is interesting ta reinterpret
Marx in the light of the modern tbeory of
econamic growth. According ta that theory as
it has been developed, especially by Rostow,
national economies go tbrougb five main
phases as they grow and develop. The first
stage, the traditional or the pioneer, corresponds ta the situation of many underdeveloped countries today; secondly, the preindustrial era; thirdly, the take-oif stage,
when economic development becames rapid
and broader-based; fourtbly, the industrial
period; and finally, the post-industrial era,
wbicb is characterized by affluence and the
predominance of service or tertiary industries.
For Marx, as reinterpreted in the ligbt of
this modemn theory, these different stages of
growth were ta be accompanied by radical
transformations of the economic and political
systems in the world. Thus. economic actîvity
in traditional societies and even during the
pre-industrial period, was ta take place
witbin the general framework of feudalism.
During the take-oif stage and most of the
industrial period, feudalismn was ta be
replaced by liberal capitalism, a combination
of private enterprise and political non-intervention, or laissez-faire. However, according
ta Marx the internai contradictions of capitalism were supposed ta lead ta its eventual
destruction and its replacement by dictatorial
sacialism, as a result of the revoit of the
proletariat, of the growing industrial reserve
army, as Marx defined it, or of growing
unemplayment. Finally, as affluence was
reached during the post-industrial era, the
state, according ta Marx, would wither away,
cammunism would appear, freedom would be
restored and eacb citizen would give ta society according ta, bis abilities and receive from
it according ta bis needs. Thus, according ta
Marx, ail national economies were ta be subjected ta the same linear pattern of growth,
beginnîng with feudalism and ending with
cammunism. This was the real meaning, I
tbink, of Khruschev's famous remark in the
United States: "We wlll ahl bury you."
21498-204l

It is quite easy for us today ta see that this
Marxist theary was wrong. It is true that at
the beginning of the process of growtb, feudalism was predaminant tbroughout the
warld, but we now know that nations have
nat taken the saine road ta reach the take-oif
stage and ta industrialize. Two main extreme
positions emerged at that stage: liberal capitalism in the west, as observed by Marx, and
dictatorial sociai.ismn in the east, beginning
with the U.S.S.R. This was the origin of what
I have called the ideology gap. Thus, dictatorial socialism, f ar fram being the heir and
successar of liberal capitalism, as foreseen by
Marx, has proven ta be an alternative and
opposite road ta industrialization for certain
countries. No country which has industrialized under the conditions of liberal capitalism
bas accepted dictatorial sacialism by choice,
or by ils normal internai evolution. No country which has adopted dictatorial socialism
without external intervention bad lived under
capitalism before.
But there is a trend whicb is even more
interesting ta observe. While countries may
use opposite raads ta industrialize, these
roads are eventually canverging and will lead
very likely, during the past-industrial era, ta
the same point, wbich is nat cammunism but
a sort of mixture between socialism and capitalism, a blending of collectivism and private
initiative, of state intervention and individual
freedom.
The reasons for this canverging evolution
are quite simple ta understand. Capitalism
initially put its main empbasis on freedam,
and sacialism first saught collective security.
Liberal capitalism generates economic and
social insecurity, and gavernments are eventually forced ta intervene in ecanomic and
social spheres by the electorate. The result is
a mixed economy based on private and public
initiative, on more gavernment planning and
control. On the ather band, rising standards
of living, including better education, in socialist dictatorships gradually develop the need
for mare indîvidual freedom. and less collective security, for more private initative and
less government intervention.
It is quite evident, I think, that the East
and the West are moving towards this
common econornic and political position.
Western countries bave already reached it,
and there are numerous signs indicating that
eastern European nations are alsa moving in
that direction. Thus, the ideology gap
between East and West is closing and a seriaus source of real confiict between the two is

SENATE DEBATES
disappearing. We should be realistic enough
at least to observe this most important
phenomenon, and to see its military and
political implications for the future. I could
quote a lot of illustrations in support of this
theory.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: Not Czechoslovakia.
Hon. Mr. Lamontagne: I will refer to Czechoslovakia later.
This growing economic and ideological rapprochement between East and West, although
most significant, is not the only important
factor contributing to the changing situation
in Europe. There are at least two others. The
rise of Red China as a new world power and
her recent aggressiveness towards Soviet
Russia constitute a major new element in that
situation. The cold war between Moscow and
Peking has, in my view-although I am far
from being an expert in this field-two
causes. One is territorial, the other is ideological.
The territorial claims of Red China in
Northern Asia do not need to be recalled
here, but the ideological cause of the cold war
deserves a few words of explanation.
In terms of the successive phases of economic growth that I have described previously, mainland China is still at her take-off
stage, while the U.S.S.R is reaching the end
of her industrial period. This means that the
Chinese revolution is still at its virulent stage.
It has proclaimed itself as the only faithful
interpreter of the Marxist-Leninist doctrine,
but the Russians, in their desire to reach
affluence, are losing their communist faith
and have become much more interested in
studying and adopting American technology
and management techniques than in Marxist
teachings. Here again I could quote a lot of
illustrations of this fact. As a result, a serious
conflict of interest and a widening ideological
gap are developing between Red China and
the Soviet Union. This is a second reason why
the Russians are more and more likely to
remain quiet on their western front.
There is a third important element in the
changing international situation. In the last 20
years the big powers have learned to fear
each other, to respect their respective zones
of influence and to refuse direct confrontation
in the international No Man's Land of the
underdeveloped world. The Berlin air-lift, the
Berlin Wall, the massive eruption of the
Chinese in North Korea, the American Blockade of Cuba, and recent events in Czecho(Hon. Mr. Lamontagne.]

December 9, 1969

slovakia have shown to what extent the big
powers could go to protect their own spheres
of influence.
The end of the war in Vietnam will, in my
view, mark the beginning of a period of international status quo. The boundaries of these
zones may and will change in the future, but
this will happen as a result of the revolt of
dominated countries and of the political
incapacity of the big power involved to intervene rather than as a consequence of outside
military intervention. The United States did
not take the risk of supporting Hungary or
Czechoslovakia, and the U.S.S.R. is not likely,
in the future, to intervene militarily in South
America.
Thus, the three main factors which have
changed the relationship between East and
West in the last 20 years are all contributing
to an easing of tensions in Europe. As a
result, the danger of a military conflict is
becoming more and more remote in that
strategic region.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: You do not give any credit
to NATO for that?
Hon. Mr. Lamontagne: I am not against
NATO, as I will show later. What I want to
say is that the political systems themselves, in
their very structure, have been changing all
along. That is why I say that in my view the
Cold War is over and the era of the Cold
Peace is beginning.
During the last two decades, as the ideological gap between East and West was closing,
the development gap between the industrialized countries and the underdeveloped
nations was widening. This is undoubtedly
the greatest challenge that the world will
have to face in the last 30 years of this
century.
I wish to describe just a few main dimensions of this widening gap and, in particular,
to stress the fact that the assistance given by
industrialized countries often tends to complicate rather than to solve the problems of the
underdeveloped nations. For instance, let us
take the population movement. There is no
doubt that our shipments of food and drugs,
and the transfer of medical knowledge, have
improved health conditions in this great area
of the world. The result has been that the
span of human life has been extended significantly in recent years. For instance, in India,
the normal life expectancy of women rose
from 27 years in 1946 to 48 years in 1966.
Thus the period of fertility has more than
doubled.

December 9, 1969

SENATE DEBATES

Moreover, the infant mortality rate has
declined substantially. In Kenya 51 per cent
of the population was under 16 years of age
in 1964. On the other hand, the methods of
birth control developed in the West are not
easily exportable, because it is well established that their utilization is closely related,
not to religion, but to the standard of living
and to the level of education. These combined
factors are producing the population explosion. The experts of the United Nations are
forecasting that world population will grow
from 3.3 billion in 1965 to 6.1 billion at least
in the year 2000. During that period the
population of the industrialized nations will
increase by only 40 per cent while that of the
underdeveloped countries will more than
double, rising from 2.2 billion to at least 4.7
billion. This is the basic dimension of the
widening gap for which our assistance programs are unfortunately and perhaps unavoidably partly responsible.
Let us now look at another important
aspect of that gap. The best projections available show that the annual gross national product per capita is likely to grow in the United
States from $3,800 in 1965 to $15,000 in 1995,
as compared with $80 and $130 in India
during the same period. Thus, while the
G.N.P. per capita is now 48 times greater in
the United States than in India, it will be 115
times higher in 1995. James Bonner, the great
expert on the world food problem, has
estimated that in 1960 the average number of
calories available per capita and per day in
the underdeveloped countries was 2,000, but
that this estimate would decline constantly to
reach only 1,500 in the year 2000. This is on
the assumption that recent trends continue to
prevail, including of course the current levels
of our assistance programs. If the food gap is
growing on a per capita basis and if population is likely to more than double, the dimension of the food problem may soon become
completely unmanageable.
It is certainly technologically feasible to
increase food production substantially in the
underdeveloped countries. The key factor is
improved productivity, but this is not easy
to achieve in practice. First, the unfavourable
social climate, characterized by deeply rooted
traditions, has to be overcome. This is a most
difficult challenge in itself. Secondly, in order
to increase productivity vast amounts of capital will be needed to control water systems, to
fight against pests, to produce cheaper fertilizers and to improve marketing conditions.
But capital is very scarce in the under-

developed countries. Moreover, the rapid
improvement of productivity on the farms
will generate massive unemployment which
the weak industrial sector will not be able to
absorb. For instance, it is estimated that in
Kenya next year 720,000 young people will be
17 years of age, and that at least half of them
will not be able to find employment. Thus, it
becomes quite evident that economic development is almost indivisible and that a balance
of growth must be maintained between the
various sectors of a national economy.
Honourable senators, as you can see, it will
not be easy to close the development gap and
to break the circle of over-population and
economic underdevelopment. This problem is
massive, urgent, and new. The western world
reached its pre-industrial stage-where most
underdeveloped countries are today-about
150 years ago. Canada was an exception. It
never really had to face the circle which I
have just mentioned. The social environment
of the western world was favourable to
industrialization. Its population problem,
when it arose, was easily met by massive
emigration, wars, and famines. Its industrialization was a natural phenomenon which
could be left alone to develop slowly and
normally. The West was leading the way and
did not feel any sense of urgency.
As I have shown, the situation of the
underdeveloped countries today is vastly different. As they see the emergence of the postindustrial societies of the western world, they
will not be content to wait 150 years to reach
the threshold of affluence. They will not tolerate indefinitely the widening development
gap. They will certainly not accept the
absolute decline in their standard of living
that Professor Bonner is forecasting. This is
the most complex and urgent problem that
the world has ever faced and also, perhaps,
the greatest menace to western civilization
since the invasion of the Roman Empire
-especially
if the underdeveloped countries were to accept, in despair, the aggressive
leadership of Red China.
Honourable senators, the world has
changed indeed in the last 20 years, but our
attitudes and policies in the West have not
followed the same radical evolution. Too
many of us still see the situation in Europe as
it was two decades ago, and continue to
ignore the major crisis emerging in the third
world, which will soon become the second
world. For instance, President Nixon, in my
view, made a serious miscalculation when he
proposed some months ago to reduce the

SENATE DEBATES
American budget for foreign aid to its lowest
level in recent years. Of course, unilateral
disarmament in Europe would be unwise, but
NATO countries could have done more to
close the credibility gap between East and
West in the hope of accelerating the detente
and to implement Article II of the Treaty, as
so often advocated by Canadian spokesmen.
Fortunately, West Germany, at last, is moving
in the right direction to close this credibility
gap.
Some countries will have to start looking at
world problems within their new perspective
and in the light of future priorities. This is,
surely, a wise attitude for a country like
Canada to take. Basically, we have to
choose-and this is where I am quite ready to
face the challenge issued to me at the beginning of my speech by the Leader of the
Opposition-between continuing our military
assistance to Western Europe and increasing
our economic assistance to the underdeveloped countries.

[Hon. Mr. Lamontagne.]

December 9, 1969

SENATE DEBATES

increased foreign aid to underdeveloped countries. While our military role in NATO is
marginal, and can be played at least as effectively and without any great additional sacrifice by Western Europe, our position vis-a-vis
the underdeveloped world is almost unique.
We have two languages which are widely
used in the third world; we have no imperial
past and I am sure we have no imperial
future; we have the skills and know-how to
assist in promoting economie development in
the underdeveloped countries. Because of that
unique position, we can be much more useful
in the long run to the western alliance if we
carry out a complementary mission in the
underdeveloped countries, instead of merely
duplicating the role of the other members of
that alliance in Europe. Thus, this major shift
in Canada's mission can be viewed as a sound
and useful application of the international
division of labour.
The fourth point is that, in that new context, we could envisage a new role for our
armed services. Instead of being restricted to
the role of "bird watchers"-and I remember
that expression being used in the other place
some years ago by a distinguished member of
the Opposition who is in the Senate now-in
Germany or in Canada, our armed forces
could also serve as a peace corps on particular missions in underdeveloped countries.
These nations not only need financial assistance, but must also change their social environment, learn new trades and learn how
to use new technology. The wonderful training that the members of our armed forces
receive could certainly be used most effectively to promote the development of poor
nations. With these kinds of technical
resources, the impact of our financial assistance would be greatly increased.
The fifth point is that our approach to
external aid, until recently, has lacked the
kind of planning and research that it needs to
attain its maximum efficiency. It has been too
piecemeal, too unsystematic and unco-ordinated. It was not based on adequate information or on a sound theory of economic
growth.
Hon. Mr. Martin: Will the honourable senator permit me to ask him a question?
Hon. Mr. Lamontagne: Yes. I did not want
to criticize the former Minister of External
Affairs.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: Why not?
Hon. Mr. Martin: I do not mind the criticism, but I just want clarification of a point.

With regard to the fourth point, Senator
Lamontagne said he envisaged a new role for
the armed services. He went on to say that
that role in turn would envisage the promoting and developing of new nations. Would the
armed forces do that as armed forces or as
personnel otherwise engaged?
Hon. Mr. Lamontagne: Certainly as personnel otherwise engaged. I do not think we
should send our armies abroad.
Hon. Mr. Grosart: Not in uniform.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: Maybe we should send the
C.Y.C. over there.
Hon. Mr. Lamontagne: The proposed
Research Institute on International Development, which, I think, will come up for our
consideration very soon, will, in my view, fill
an important gap in our external aid effort. It
should be set up promptly but properly, and
its activities should not be restricted to
research on technology and development
work. It must also develop realistic models of
economic growth and new techniques to
improve the social environment, which, in my
view, is the great obstacle to industrial development in many underdeveloped countries.
The sixth point is that our new approach to
external aid must be co-ordinated as much as
possible with the effort of other countries. As
compared with the total needs, our programs
will always remain relatively small and we
cannot afford to duplicate what other countries are doing. The global multilateral
approach under the auspices of the United
Nations still presents serious difficulties for
big powers. The bilateral approach is bound
to be ineffective. Canada should take the
initiative and invite other countries-such as
Sweden, Norway, Austria, Switzerland and,
possibly, Australia, New Zealand and Yugoslavia-to join with us and launch a more
restricted but genuine multilateral approach.
Finally, if Canada thus redefines her role
in the world, there should be within the
Canadian Government a minister in charge of
international development, just as we now
have a Minister of Regional Economic Expansion. This new minister would, of course, have
to work in close collaboration with other departments, especially with the Secretary of
State for External Affairs and the Minister of
National Defence.
If we decide to follow the course which I
have just proposed, we should not be
ashamed of it or even defensive about it. On
the contrary, we should be proud of it

SENATE DEBATES
because it would be the right course to take
for a better Canadian contribution to the
world and for a better Canada; moreover, it
would undoubtedly strengthen our national
identity and unity.
Canada has, indeed, reached the international crossroads. We have to choose between
making a minor contribution to the prevention of a conflict in Europe, which is becoming a more and more remote possibility, and
playing a greater and more substantial role in
preventing a world catastrophe, which will
become inevitable if nothing is done about it.
[Translation]
Our choice, at this crossroads, is very simple,
I think. We must, at one and the same time,
work towards closing the ideological gap that
separates the East from the West and help
underdeveloped countries to succeed in their
industrial takeoff, so that the affluence gap
that isolates them from the industrialized
countries does not continue to grow. That is a
big challenge, but the Western world, including Canada, cannot afford not to take it up.

Hon. Mr. Carter: Oh, no. He himself called

Hon. Mr. Flynn: What is the hurry? There

Lamontagne were we to ask Senator Carter to
reply immediately.
Hon. Mr. Martin: Having heard the honourable Leader of the Opposition at Strasbourg,
I fully expected that he would rise to answer
tonight.

On motion of Hon. Mr. Carter, debate

THE ESTIMATES
REPORT OF NATIONAL FINANCE
COMMITTEE ADOPTED
The Senate proceeded to consideration of
the report of the Standing Senate Committee
on National Finance with respect to the Supplementary Estimates (A) laid before Parliament for the fiscal year ending 31st March,
1970.
Hon. T. D'Arcy Leonard moved that the
report be adopted.
He said: Honourable senators, my first
remarks are to call your attention to the fact
that, pursuant to the order of the Senate, the
report was printed in the Minutes of the Proceedings of last Thursday and is attached to
the Orders of the Day for today at pages 127
and following, including the attachment of
an appendix to the report.
At its meeting dealing with Supplementary
Estimates (A), the committee had before it
the Honourable C. M. Drury, President of
the Treasury Board, Mr. Cloutier and Mr.
MacDonald, two of the senior officers of the
Treasury Board. I think all members of the
committee had an opportunity to ask questions on the Estimates and received very full
and free answers to those questions.
I would point out at this time, honourable
senators, that these are the first supplementary Estimates we have had before us since
the main Estimates were tabled last February. I believe we can see a trend towards
fewer supplementary Estimates-at any rate I
hope so-and those that come before us will
not be in such large amounts. This is, I believe, a result of the kind of scrutiny that

December 9, 1969

SENATE DEBATES

the National Finance Committee of the Senate and the appropriate committees of the
House of Commons have been giving to these
Estimates, with a view to including in the
main Estimates as far as possible the budgetary expenditures for the year, and to the
bringing in of supplementary Estimates only
when absolutely necessary.
It is inevitable that there will be supplementary Estimates. When you consider that
the original Estimates are prepared by the
various departments in November-for example the main Estimates for the coming fiscal
year are prepared in November 1969-it is inevitable that throughout the year new objects
of expenditure come forward, while some
funds are not fully used, with the result that
supplementary expenditures become necessary. However, in this connection I point out
that the total amount is some $66 million
which, when compared with other supplementary expenses, is not in itself overly
large. As Mr. Drury pointed out in his evidence before us, in adding these Estimates
to the main Estimates you reach a total of
$11,924 million. He further pointed out that
notwithstanding these additional Estimates
and notwithstanding what is expected in the
way of further Estimates, the Government
apparently still contemplates an overall surplus of the order of $250 million on its
accounts for the fiscal year 1969-70.
The largest single item in the Supplementary Estimates (A) is $40 million, being a
vote to Treasury Board to supplement the
pay raises in the various government departments. This one item in itself constitutes almost two-thirds of the total amount
involved in the Supplementary Estimates (A).
This, as was explained to us by Mr. Drury, is
part of what one might cal a new procedure-comparatively new at any rate-in
dealing with negotiations with the public
servants.
Since this new procedure was instituted
several years ago, some 72 agreements have
been arrived at between various classes of
public servants and the appropriate departments of government; and now the Government is starting on a second round of these
negotiations. In his explanation Mr. Drury
used the phrase that the Government in these
bargaining arrangements does not wish to tip
its hand. Therefore, this method is used to
vote a sum of money to Treasury Board
which will be carried forward to the extent of
the amount remaining unused in any one year
as a reserve, with similar votes in other

years, so that there is no relationship between
the amount that Treasury Board may have on
hand and what it may require in connection
with any particular bargaining agreement.
This is the reason that a lump sum of $40
million is placed in the hands of Treasury
Board under this vote. If and when agreements are reached, the departments needing
to supplement their own pay increases can
have the necessary money transferred from
this vote of the Treasury Board to the appropriate department.
I would next call to your attention, honourable senators, that there are some 44 $1
items in the supplementary Estimates. This is
a matter which we have had under discussion
in the National Finance Committee for some
years. There was a time when these items
seemed to be used as an indirect form of
legislation and, indeed, on other occasions
there did not seem to be a satisfactory explanation. I think this change has been
brought about as a result of the scrutiny
given in the Senate and is something for
which the committee can take some credit. I
would call your attention to the fact, for
example, that in November 1967-I think in
response to questioning by Senator GrosartDr. George Davidson, then secretary of the
Treasury Board, gave the committee an undertaking that in future the committee would be
supplied with a mimeographed statement
explaining every single $1 item. This was
done; Mr. Drury filed such a statement with
us and it also appears in the printed report of
our proceedings.
I think you will find as you read through
these items that there is a satisfactory explanation for each and every $1 item. For example, when a department applies to Treasury
Board for a new expenditure that had not
been foreseen in November last year or at
the time the main Estimates were prepared,
the Treasury Board says to that department, "Do you have some unexpended funds
in another vote, or are there other votes
that do not have the same priority as the
item requiring this new amount of money
you are asking for?" If the department is able
to find the money under some other vote or
even under that particular vote itself, then
the money is transferred from the previous
vote or from within the existing vote to the
new project for which the money is being
sought, and the $1 item is put in to indicate
the change in direction of those funds.
As far as the other items in Supplementary
Estimates (A) are concerned, I think they

SENATE DEBATES
speak for themselves, and it is not necessary
for me to go through them in detail. However, in closing I would point out that
we are improving our method of dealing with
the Government's requirements for monies to
meet its budget. Rather than debating them
on a supply bill, over which we have only a
limited amount of control, we have the President and officials of the Treasury Board, the
ministers and the senior officers of these departments, come before us whenever we want
them, we are able to bring about a more intelligent scrutiny of the items and thus bring
about improvements and changes in the administration of the financial affairs of the
Government.
Hon. Mr. Burchill: Senator Leonard
expressed the view that he thought he recognizei a trend tDwards fewer supplementary
Estimates. This evening he has dealt with
Supplementary Estimates (A). Did the minister :nd cate how many supplementaries there
would be?
Hon. Mr. Leonard: Not in alphabetical
order nor in the total amount, other than the
general statement that what they could foresec with respect to any future supplementary
Estimates would still keep the total overall
expenditures-the main and all the supplementary Estimates-within the plans of the
Government to finish the year with a surplus

of $250 million.

December 9. 1969

adequate basis for further consideration of
the Estimates as they come before us.
We all recognize the fact that the Senate
does have a rather limited role with respect
to supply and ways and means, and the cornmittee, under Senator Leonard, has therefore
concentrated rather on a broad overview of
the system and structure by which Parliament is kept informed of the whys and
wherefores of public spending. In doing so, in
the last two years the committee bas paid
particular attention, as Senator Leonard has
said, to these $1 items. Also as Senator
Leonard has said, the Senate and the
committee are entitled to take some credit
for this, because it is rather remarkable that
this device-and that is all it is-of hiding,
and deliberately hiding, the function of certain requests to Parliament for money, bas
grown up over the years and, until the Senate
took it in hand, without rebuke and without
an attempt to change it. I took the trouble to
look over the records and to inquire, and I am
reasonably satisfied that the first serious
attempt to bring about the kind of disclosure
we now have was made by the Senate
committee.
Hon. Mr. Martin: Does the senator not
think the word "hiding" is inaccurately used

Hon. Mr. Choquette: Covering up.

did-he will find some interesting examples
of rather well-hidden facts. Perhaps I can
give him an example.
As Senator Leonard pointed out, certain
moneys have been "found". We speak of supplementary Estimates of $66.4 million. Actually the supplementary Estimates called for
parliamentary authority to spend $91 million
or $92 million, leaving aside the loans of $25
million. That is so because these $1 items ask
Parliament to authorize $25 million in extra
vote items, which is now being found in some
other vote. So it is an authorization of a
of $91 million.

APPROPRIATION BILL No. 4, 1969
FIRST READING

The Hon. the Speaker informed the Senate
that a message had been received from the
House of Commons with Bill C-169, for granting to Her Majesty certain sums of money for
the public service for the financial year
ending 3lst March, 1970.
Bill read first time.
SECOND READING

The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, when shail this bill be read the second
timne?
Hon. Leopohd Langlois: Honourable senators, I have just been informed that due to an
unexpected dehay this bill has not been printed yet. It is i the process of being put i
mimeographed form, and I understand copies
will be distributed momentarily. If honourable senators have no objection, I am prepared
to move second reading and proceed wilh the
explanation of the bill now. If there is objection, I will ask that it stand until hater this
day.
Hon. Senators: Agreed.

These Estimates consist of budgetary expenditures of $66,446,526 and Loans, Investments
and Advances of $24,760,002 or a total of
$91,206,528.
I have caused a resumé of Appropriation
Acts Nos. 2 and 3, and the present act, Appropriation Act No. 4, to be distributed ini
mimeographed form, and I assume that
honourable senators have this resumé on
their desks now.
This bill, together with the previous supply
bis, releases total Estimates for 1969-70 of
$12,558 million, of which $11,924 million consists of budgetary expenditures and the balance, $634 million, of Loans, Investinents and
Advances.
The major part of the proposed supplementary Estimates requirement of $66 million
consists of $40 million for the Treasury Board
contingencies vote. This amount is required to
supplement departinental votes for the cost of
salary adjustments arising out of collective
bargaining. The appropriation wording provides for payments owing with respect to
1969-70 and prior fiscal years.
Honourable senators will also note that a
practice introduced in the final supplementary Estimates for 1968-69 is being continued
here, namely, the redirection of funds from
appropriations already approved by Parliament to refiect changing needs and priorities.
For each such transfer an amount of $1 is
shown i the Estimates as a net requirement
to bring the item before Parliament and to
obtain approval for the transfer.
Finally, I would point out that these Estimates were tabled in the Senate on November
19 hast and on the same day were referred to
the Standing Senate Committee on National
Finance for examination. This committee, following their consideration of these Estimates,
reported back on December 4, which report
was finally approved by this chamber yesterday. The report was printed as an appendix
to Hansard of December 4.
Honourable senators, the bill before you is
in the saine form as appropriation bis passed
in previous years and does not inchude any
additional borrowing authority.

Hon. Mr. Langlois: With leave, and notwithstanding the provisions of Rule 44(l)(f), I

SENATE DEBATES
totalling $91 million, of which $24 million was
found in, let us say, unused items of the main
Estimates which were voted last spring.
The chairman of the committee last evening indicated that the largest single item in
the Supplementary Estimates (A) is one of
$40 million, being a vote to Treasury Board to
supplement pay increases in various government departments. He said "This one item in
itself constitutes almost two-thirds of the
total amount involved in the Supplementary
Estimates (A)." I would correct this statement
by saying that it represents a little less than
half the total, because we are in fact appropriating $91 million, and this is an item of $40
million. It is two-thirds of the net addition to
the main Estimates as voted last spring, and I
would say that most of it is the result of these
increases in the pay of public servants.
Now it has been pointed out that we are
required to sanction this sum of $91 million
in the supplementary Estimates, but we find
that in various items that we approved last
spring there were amounts totalling $24 million that were not going to be spent this year.
So, the net total, as I have already mentioned,
will be only $66 million.
We had occasion in committee to inquire of
the President of the Treasury Board and of
his officials the reason we are required to
grant these supplementary Estimates; and, on
the whole, I think we obtained a satisfactory
explanation. It was mentioned at that time
that these supplementary Estimates-of
which we may have a further one or two
before the end of the fiscal year-are in line
with the objective of the Minister of Finance,
as outlined in his budget speech of last
spring, to achieve a balanced budget.
I would mention that in committee I asked
the President of the Treasury Board whether
the austerity program announced by the Government would be reflected in the overall picture of the fiscal year ending next March 31.
He indicated that it would not be reflected
because the austerity program would take
effect only in the next fiscal year. However,
there should be some savings, because some
of the decisions which have been made are
immediately effective. Yet the minister was
not in a position to indicate whether these
would be substantially reflected in this year's
Public Accounts.
As I said earlier, this bill is merely a sanction of the Supplementary Estimates (A)
which were referred to and studied by the
[Hon. Mr. Flynn.]

committee, the report of which we approved
last evening. Consequently, I see no reason
why we should delay second reading of this
bill at this time.

bill, more on the procedural than on the substantive side.

share the hopes of the Leader of the Opposition, Senator Flynn, that there will be a substantial reduction in the amount of the Estimates next year. Although one can live in
hope, I do not know that there is any historic
justification for this kind of optimism, either
on his or my part, because, as honourable
senators know, government expenditures, like
all other expenditures and in particular those
of large corporate enterprises, are rising at an
alarming rate.
The great economic problem in this country
today is inflation, and one of the major obstacles in solving it is the restricted power of the
federal authority to deal with such matters as
prices and wages, in the absence in peace
time of legislation such as the War Measures
Act. Perhaps eventually there will be a constitutional change which will allow the federal authority to take definite steps to combat
inflation, which can be a disaster for the
nation as a whole, and in particular the poor.
We have seen examples of this in other countries, especially in parts of Europe after the
war. I hope that the provincial and federal
authorities will be able to agree some day on
a formula which will enable the federal Government to take definitive and strong action
to deal with this great ogre which threatens
the Western world.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: May I ask the
honourable senator if the Government has
power to control the amount of money in
circulation?
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Oitawa West): There
is certainly no question that it has. I
would defer to Senator Roebuck in matters of
monetary policy and power because he is an
expert in that field and I am an amateur.
Monetary policy can affect the development and spread of the contagion of inflation. Whether it can do so fully and
effectively without the control of wages,
prices and profits, is perhaps a matter of conjecture. Monetary policy can give a lead and
perhaps a direction, but in spite of the fact
that the Government appears to be attempting through monetary policy to do these

December 10, 1969

SENATE DEBATES

things, prices are rising throughout industry.
There is nothing effective in a legislative way
that the Government of Canada can do,
because there are constitutional limitations.
I commend the Leader of the Government
in the Senate for continuing the practice
which has been followed here for a number
of years. I do not apologize for repeating what
I have said before. I remember that for many
years appropriation bills would come here
near the end of a session, or of a Parliament,
and members of the Opposition-my party
did it when we were in opposition-could
complain that all we were doing was rubber
stamping. We did not know what the figures
meant. We could not possibly get answers to
questions we would have liked to ask about
the details of the Estimates. There was simply
no opportunity to do so. Justification for the
approval that is given by this house has been
supplied by the device that the Government
leader is now using. I used it when I had the
privilege of sitting where he sits now, as did
my predecessor. That instrument is the
Standing Senate Committee on National
Finance, and the great work that bas been
done by its chairman Senator Leonard.
There is a great deal of know-how in the
finance committee, not only on the part of the
chairman, but of the Leader of the Opposition, and Senator Grosart, who is a hardnosed critic on financial matters, and others
who do their home work. We question in a
very definite and succinct way the minister
and the officials on specific items. I am heartened to see the kind of responsible questioning
that takes place in that committee, regardless
of party lines. It is a responsible kind of inquiry by a second chamber designed to give
second thought to legislation.
I admit that we cannot change the figures
in the Estimates, either upwards or downwards. We certainly cannot increase them,
and if we decrease them I am sure the Leader
of the Government would have to say, as I
can remember even Senator Aseltine having
said, and as I said myself, that we cannot do
it because it would interfere with ways and
means. Now under this system Senator Flynn
was able last evening to refer to the report
made by the Standing Senate Committee on
National Finance, under its Chairman, Senator Leonard, which outlined the kind of
explanations given, and in particular the
reasons for the $1 items, a matter which at
one time caused much concern to the late
Senator McCutcheon.

Today we are approaching thîs somewhat
overwhelming problem, namely, expenditures
reaching the proportions of box-car figures,
wi h some assurance. Even the supplementary
Estimates are $91 million, which is more than
the total budget of the Government of
Canada not very long ago. The country is
expanding, the population is growing, government revenues are increasing and, of course,
we can expect the Estimates to go up. As long
as we have the opportunity to examine what
is happening and recognize the trends, then
we are not sitting here in the dark, rubberstamping appropriation bills.
I think all honourable senators are pleased
to see a short summary of the amounts that
have already been voted in earlier appropriation acts this year, amounts that are statutory, amounts that have to be voted, and
amounts involving payments from the Old
Age Security Fund. In other words, I think our
approach to appropriation bills is becoming
more enlightened. I believe that is not only a
credit to the Senate, but also a source of
satisfaction to ourselves.
Hon. Donald Cameron: Honourable senators, this may be an appropriate occasion to
ask a question, perhaps directed to the Standing Senate Committee on National Finance.
It will be recalled that two years or more
ago there was a good deal of comment about
taking the ceiling off interest rates, on which
there were arguments pro and con. After discussion in the o'her place and in this house, it
was agreed to remove the ceiling on interest
rates. There were suggestions that if the ceiling were removed interest rates would find
their own level, and there might even be a
reduction in the rates being charged.
We know what has happened to interest
rates in the past two years. They have been
at an all-time high, and there is no indication
that they will be lower. The banks, in their
financial statements for the year ending 1968,
if I am accurate in my memory, show that
profits were at an all-time high. Two nights
ago the press reported that the profits of the
banks were again at an all-time high for the
year ending October 31.
Now, I wonder what steps we are taking
and what we can do to examine the extent
that these profits are contributing to inflation
today. I think it is time we took a look at this
situation. There is a rising tide of unrest and
western
in
particularly
dissatisfaction,
Canada, about the high interest rates, high
freight rates, and matters of a related nature.
I would suggest, honourable senators, that

SENATE DEBATES

this may be an item at which the finance
committee, in its wisdom, might take a deeper
look and report back to this chamber.
Hon. Hariland de M. Molson: Honourable
senators, I intended to say a word about this
bill before Senator Cameron spoke. I am
going to say that word, but I am also going to
say something to Senator Cameron.
I presume it is generally known that I am a
director of a bank. Therefore, I shall declare
my interest at this point, and I would like to
deal very briefly with a couple of points
raised by Senator Cameron.
First, the profits and the volume of business
and assets of the banks are unquestionably
enormous. I am sure that even those associated with banks are surprised to learn that they
are so large. A person who deals with figures
can appreciate that when the basis is changed
from year to year a completely different
result is obtained. In the course of the last
year the reserve basis of the banks was
changed, with the result that the banks did
not put into reserves the sums put into thern
in years gone by. This meant that those
amounts immediately came into their profits,
which I will say right away were also very
high. It is rather interesting to note that it
also meant that the federal treasury benefited by perhaps a more than doubling of the
income taxes paid by the banks last year.
This amount did not, therefore, accrue to the
shareholders. In large measure, apart from
the increase in the volume of business, it was
occasioned by the fact that the basis of
reserves was changed during the year. If I
remember correctly, the bank with which I
am associated is paying $41 million in income
taxes this year against $17 million the year
before. This is the measure of change in that
respect.
My other point concerns interest rates. I am
sorry to think that perhaps Senator Cameron
has had the same experiences that I have had.
He must have been in a bank recently,
because he seems a little discouraged about
the rates, as I believe we all are. Interest
rates are unquestionably having an effect on
business. Nobody can deny that they have an
inflationary effect, but this is an area in
which Canada has absolutely no freedom.
Interest rates in Canada have risen enormously. Everybody thinks they are too high, but I
suggest that they look around the world to
see what has happened in areas of traditionally low-cost money, perhaps lower than
Canada.
[Hon. Mr. Cameron.]

December 10, 1969

Al of us have heard it said, even in this
chamber, that Canadian bank rates and interest rates are too high, that if you go across to
the United States you will find that the prime
rate there is about 1 per cent or 11 per cent
lower. It has been explained from time to
time that American banks have a habit of
asking for a compensating deposit of 10 per
cent or 20 per cent of the amount of the loan,
which affects the real rates of interest and
makes them closely approximate Canadian
rates. Historically, American rates, without
taking into account the compensating deposit,
have been lower, and at times considerably
lower, than Canadian rates. Today-and this
is one of the few times in history-they are
on a par with Canadian rates. In Canada we
say we are unhappy about our rates, but how
can we possibly relieve that situation, sitting
as we do beside a country of the dimensions
of the United States? For the first time, our
rates are the same as theirs; they are not
higher.
In Europe, Eurodollar rates today are up,
varying with the term, from about 9, per cent
to 11 per cent; and, as you know, the prime
rate here is 81 per cent.
Look at what the federal Government pays
to borrow money and what the provincial
governments and provincial hydro commissions pay for money. Hydro Quebec borrowed
money just the other day at 9.88 per cent. It
is an alarming rate, but you cannot suggest
the banks are to blame for that. This is part
of the condition of tight money-high interest
rates throughout the world. I personally think
they are most undesirable and almost shocking, but I do not really feel that we can beat
our chests and say that in Canada we have
any opportunity to correct that situation-I
wish we had.
Hon. Arthur W. Roebuck: May I ask the
honourable gentleman a question? When he
speaks of high interest rates, has he taken
into consideration the fact of the fall and the
prospective fall in the value of money with
which borrowing will be repaid? Our experiences for the last few years have been a
reduction in the value of the dollar by 4 or 5
per cent, or perhaps more at times-certainly
about 5 per cent. Therefore, if money is borrowed and repaid at the end of the year, the
money that will be used to repay will be
worth 5 per cent less than the money was
when it was borrowed.
If you take the 8 per cent interest rate
being paid on present Government borrowings and deduct the 5 per cent decrease in the

December 10, 1969

SENATE DEBATES

value of the money during the year, you will
get a rate of only 3 per cent. Have you considered that when you say that the interest
rates are high?
Hon. Mr. Molson: I have considered these
things, senator. There are an enormous
number of factors, and I listened with great
interest to your speech the other day on what
is happening to our money. What you said is
so tragically true. Nowadays, nobody repays
precisely what they borrow. They repay
sometimes with a 10 per cent discount. At the
rate things have been going recently, on the
longer term, it is more likely to be a discount
of 20 per cent or 30 per cent.
I think inflation unquestionably has a bearing on the high interest rate. What I really
was touching on, in particular response to
Senator Cameron, was the fact that this is
so universal that no matter how undesirable,
we simply have no opportunity in Canada of
correcting it. I am sure that if someone were
to come up with a suggestion of how it could
be done, people would be prepared to tackle
it. So far, suggestions have not come forth.
Honourable senators, in regard to the
Appropriation Bill, I would call your attention to the fact that in these last Estimates we
are really dealing with the application of
more funds-roughly, $25 million-than appears on the surface.
As has been so well explained by both the
Chairman of the Finance Committee and by
Senator Grosart, the new money amounts to
$66 million. In addition to that, there is
approximately $25 million that has been realized from programs which have not been carried through. Therefore, those allocations
become available. That gives us the figure of
$91 million. Unfortunately-I say unfortunately in the sense that it confuses us a bitthere is another sum involved in this, namely,
the Loans, Investments and Advances item,
$24,760,002. That is almost another $25
million. So there is $66 million of new money,
and $25 million which fortunately has been
saved to be used again, as set forth in the
supplementary estimates. In addition to that
there are sums which aggregate roughly $25
million. They are put under this heading of
Loans, Investments and Advances, although
the number of repayments is very small.
They are sums which will be expended under
this other heading of Loans, Investments and
Advances. In effect, what is being done is the
direction of the spending of $91 million, plus
$25 million of loans-which adds up to $116
million.

Hon. Malcolm Holleft: Honourable senators, I never have understood the meaning of the so-called White Paper which the
Honourable Mr. Benson issued a few days
ago. I would call it a "black paper", and it is
very black.
Honourable senators, I happen to have in
my desk a document covering the Estimates
for 1967-68, two years ago. The total, including the payments from the Old Age Security
fund, then was $11,546 million. Compare that
with what you have before you today of $14,318 million. That is an increase of $2.7 billion,
in two years, in the expenditures of this
country.
I would like to know why we are spending
so much money. No one has brought out the
particulars. I can find out if I look it up, but I
ask now why have our expenditures gone up
by $2.7 billion in two years? What is the
cause of it? It is not the Old Age Security
Fund-$1,760 million this year, and in 1967
$1,432 million, a difference of $328 million. I
would like the honourable sponsor of the bill
to give us some information about the increase of $2.7 billion, and how it is made up.
I know it takes time to look it up but I wish
he would give us the information.
Hon. Allister Grosart: Honourable senators,
I had my say on the supplementary Estimates
yesterday evening and will not detain the
Senate very long with my remarks now.
These arise very largely because of this interesting figure of $91 million which appears in
the supplementary Estimates we have before
us. It so happens that I mentioned that figure
yesterday as the actual figure we were being
asked to vote. It is purely coincidental that
the figure of $91 million here is the same, as
Senator Molson has pointed out.
There are three categories-first, new
money that has to be found for budgetary
purposes, $66 million; then, roughly $25 million which is being found within the votes;
and on top of that is the $25 million required
for Loans, Investments and Advances.
It is purely coincidental that the figure I
mentioned yesterday evening of $91 million
as the real amount which Parliament was
being asked to authorize, is the same as we
find in the bill as it stands.
When I first looked at the bill as I came in,
I thought my remarks about the importance
of full disclosure of the actual amounts had

SENATE DEBATES

been taken to heart and that the bill might
have been revised overnight. I am sorry to say
that that is not so.
Some honourable senators showed some
concern yesterday evening when I suggested
that the $1 vote items have been used in the
past to hide the real intention of spending,
and I said deliberately hidden. I think the
concern of honourable senators might have
arisen from the fear that there was some
reflection on the integrity of the public service. I tried to assure Senator Leonard that
that was not so. The misunderstanding may
have arisen because of the assumption that
anything which anybody "hides" necessarily
has an opprobrious aspect.
Thinking it over, it occurred to me that
probably most honourable senators here have
probably already hidden away some Christmas presents. It was in that sense that I used
the word "hidden" yesterday evening.
Hon. Paul Martin: Honourable senators, I
wish to make one or two comments, particularly about what Senator Flynn and Senator
Connolly (Ottawa West) have had to say.
They expressed the hope that the Estimates
for 1970-71
would
reflect the policy
announced by the Government for its program of cutting back, its program of
retrenchment.
I think it was Senator Connolly (Ottawa
West) who said he hoped this would be the
case, that they would cut back. I assure Senator Connolly (Ottawa West), and all honourable senators, that the Government bas already
taken far-reaching steps which will be reflected in the Estimates for the fiscal year 1970-71.
The Government has been engaged for many
weeks during the present calendar year
examining the Estimates of all departments. I
know of only one area where a government
department bas not been affected. That is in
the field of external aid, where the total
amount allocated is actually on the increase,
even though, as Senator Grosart pointed out
the other day, this does not mean that the
Government is maintaining the position the
previous administration asserted, namely,
that by 1970-71 its external aid would reach
1 per cent of the gross national product.
However, this is a digression. The important thing is that every department in the
Government of Canada will show in the Estimates for 1970-71 the results of a careful
effort to bring expenses to the point where
they are more in keeping with the current
fact of inflation.
[Hon. Mr. Grosart.]

December 10, 1969

Hon. Mr. Grosari: Would that include the
Prime Minister's office?
Hon. Mr. Martin: The fact that some personnel have been added to the office of the
Prime Minister is not in any way inconsistent
with what I am saying. The obligations of
Government are growing more complicated.
The fact that there bas been an increase in
the personnel of the Prime Minister's office
is reflected by the highly efficient way in
which that office is now discharging the
duties assigned to the first minister.
Hon. Mr. Choquette: With the approval of
the Members of Parliament, do you think?
Hon. Mr. Martin: Weil, governments cannot
always get 100 per cent approval. I know this
Government would have the approval of Senator Choquette. It is not to be expected that
every Member of Parliament will fully concur
in everything the Government does.
If there is any doubt about the consequences of the Government's program of
retrenchment, let me say that the program
will be reflected unmistakably in the Estimates for the next fiscal year. For example,
in the Department of External Affairs this is
reflected in the reduction not only of programs and missions, but in the reduction of
personnel. And may I say that the decision in
that area was a very difficult one indeed. It
will be reflected in the fact that the Estimates
of the Department of National Defence, for
example, are frozen at the level of last year.
Hon. Mr. O'Leary: Would this be reflected
in the expenditures of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation and the loans with which
you cover their costs?
Hon. Mr. Martin: It will be reflected in the
fact that the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation will operate under a budget not higher
than its budget of the previous year.
The Department of National Defence is frozen, as I say, at the level of last year-$1.8
billion. The reduction by half of our military
commitment to NATO in Europe reflects a
budgetary consideration, which also was not
an easy conclusion to reach. The elimination
of military bases all over the country is a
reflection of the Government's program of
retrenchment. There are a significant number
of government establishments in Canada in
which in some way or other, partially or entirely, programs and services are being eliminated because of this program of retrenchment.

December 10, 1969

SENATE DEBATES

Why is the Government doing this, particularly when, as Senator Hollett pointed out a
few moments ago, our Estimates are up over
what they were three years ago?
Hon. Mr. Holleti: Two years ago.
Hon. Mr. Martin: And three years ago. It is
because in the meantime we have been confronted with a serious problem, as we were
reminded by Senator Connolly (Ottawa West),
of a rise in prices which affects the Canadian
community. One of the elementary ways in
which to deal with inflation is to curtail expenses and expenditures. It is not the only
way, but it is an important way. We must cut
our cloth accordingly. That is what the Government is doing.
I may say-and I hope that this will not be
regarded as a political observation, because it
is not intended to be-that I have not seen
any prime minister approach with such determination this particular problem of cutting
down. I have never seen anyone do it as
effectively-in fact, almost ruthlessly-so
impressed is the Prime Minister, as is the
Government, with the severity of the problem. It is a problem not of our making alone;
it is a problem that is not to be found only in
Canada; it is, as Senator Molson said, a problem that exists all over the world, particularly in the western world. It is a problem about
which we have to try to do something; and,
in the particular way I have mentioned,
program of
through the Government's
retrenchment, we are trying to do something
significant about it.
The Government expenditures in Canada
had risen to a point where we had to do
something. But, if this is the case for the
federal Government, it is also the case for
all governments in Canada. We cannot legislate for governments in the provinces or
municipalities. In the examination of this
problem it is right that we should recognize
that the level of increase of expenditures in
the provincial governments is higher than
the increase in federal expenditures.
Hon. Mr. Connolly
absolutely, too.

(Ottawa West): And

Hon. Mr. Martin: And absolutely, yes.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: Surely that is going a bit
too far, I suggest. It may be that the responsibilities of the provinces have been increased
more than those of the federal Government.

This is a factor which the honourable Leader
of the Government should take into account
before saying "absolutely."
Hon. Mr. Martin: I think that is a debatable
statement. I say to my friend with great
respect that I recognize that the obligations of
the provinces have increased. Of course they
have. And perhaps some of them have increased as a result of initiatives which the
federal Government has taken. Medicare is a
good example. It resulted from the initiative
of the federal Government. I, for one, do not
apologize for that initiative. Another example
is in the field of hospital construction, which
has proved of great benefit to all Canadians.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: You are talking on both
sides of the question now.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Senator Hollett said
that there has been an increase of $2.7 billion
in two years. Would there have been any
increase at all in constant dollars?
Hon. Mr. Martin: I think so. We have, for
example, the medicare program and the increase in salaries for public servants.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: But that has al been
influenced by the fall in the value of the
dollar.
Hon. Mr. Martin: That is true, but I still
have no doubt that there has been an increase
as a result of the programs initiated by the
Government.
Hon. Mr. Holleit: Thirty per cent.
Hon. Mr. Martin: However, there is another
side to it. Senator Hollett pointed out the
increase. He failed to point out the increase
in the gross national product. I remember that
in 1945 the gross national product of Canada
stood at $5 billion. Now it is true that in the
meantime our expenses have risen considerably, but our gross national product today,
being some $80 billion, is equal to that of
India, a nation of 500 million people. So, honourable senators, while we have these additional burdens, we have paralleling them the
tremendous economic growth of the nation.
Senator Connolly (Ottawa West) said he
hoped there would be retrenchments. I agree.
I have given an indication of the Government's efforts at retrenchment. I have mentioned the level of expenditures of other
senior levels of government. Is that all that
can be done?

SENATE DEBATES

When Professor Galbraith was here some
days ago he said that we should resort to a
system of controls. I was rather surprised that
he said that because, as a former Canadian,
he must know the nature of the Canadian
constitution. As Senator Connolly (Ottawa
West) pointed out, it is not possible, because
of property and civil rights enumerated in
section 92 of the British North America Act,
for the federal Government to embark upon
a program of price controls or of controls of
any kind except under the War Measures Act,
which can only come into existence in time
of war. The Government can take some other
steps. There is the possibility of further programs for the control of credit. I am not saying
that these are about to be embarked upon.
The Minister of Finance mentioned a few
days ago this is one of the areas where action
could yet be taken.
The federal Government has been meeting
in conference with the provinces for two and
one-half days. It has been agreed that there
will be a federal-provincial conference on
non-constitutional matters in February, when
an effort will be made to discuss some of the
very problems raised here today. The aim will
be to see whether a concerted effort can be
made to meet some of the problems that understandably agitate Senator Cameron and
others. I doubt very much if it is possible to
envisage the realization of a system of controls which could be legally implemented only
with the consent of every one of the ten provinces.
In any event, honourable senators, I have
risen to assure honourable senators that the
Goverrnent has taken this matter seriously.
Its prograrn of retrenchment will be reflected
in the Estimates to be presented to Parliament for the fiscal year 1970-71.

December 10, 1969

wish to add my personal gratitude as a regular sponsor of measures such as the bill presented to you today. The work of that committee renders my task much easier. With the
report of the committee available to me, it is
a pleasure to present measures of this kind.
I also wish to point out for the benefit of
those who are not at present in the chamber
and who may read our debates, that the present bill which was originally introduced in
mimeographed forrn has now been distributed
in both mimeographed and printed form.
Those outside this chamber will know that
we have not given consideration to this bill
without having it before us. I also wish to
thank all honourable senators for having allowed me to proceed with my opening statement when the bill in its final form had not
as yet been distributed.
Motion agreed to and bill read second tirne.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, when shall this bill be read the third
time?
Hon. Mr. Langlois moved that the bill be
placed on the Orders of the Day for third
reading at the next sitting.
Motion agreed to.

The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators,
when shall this report be taken into consideration?
Hon. Mr. Smith: Honourable senators, in
order to meet the convenience of one of our
colleagues opposite in particular, and perhaps
others, with leave, I move the adoption of the
report now.
Before we proceed to consider the adoption
of the report, may I say that this report
relates to Bill S-12, which I recently had the
honour of presenting on second reading. It
was given second reading and was subsequently referred to the Standing Senate Committee on Health, Welfare and Science. We
spent a lengthy period of time considering the
bill, as was indicaled we might when we listened to the remarks of Senator Sullivan
during the debate on second reading. In order
to give both the legal and medical representatives of the Department of National Health
and Welfare an opportunity to study the
remarks made in the chamber by Senator
Sullivan and also certain proposals which
were put forward at the committee meeting,
the committee did not come to a final conclusion at the first meeting, but met again this

afternoon an hour before the Senate was
called into session. As a result of the committee's having come to definite conclusions, I am
able to present this report this afternoon on
behalf of Senator Lamontagne.
The amendments are rather lengthy. In
summary, I would say they delineate more
specifically the powers of the quarantine service, with which the bill concerns itself. It
also includes an amendment-perhaps it is
the most important of all-which reduces the
hazard of compulsory vaccination for persons
for whom such would be contra-indicated
either for medical or other health reasons.
There were some consequential amendments,
as is usual in such cases, and one or two for
further clarification.
That is all I have to say on the matter. I
anticipate my colleague on the other side will
deal with the more complicated medical
aspects.
Hon. Joseph A. Sullivan: Honourable senators, I wish to take this opportunity of thanking the chairman, all the members of the
committee and the departmental officials who
listened to the suggestions and the proposed
amendments, and who came through with a
high degree of unanimity in accepting these
proposais. As all honourable senators know,
they were made in the interests of Canadians
as a whole and particularly from the medical
aspect.
There are two points I would like to stress.
One amendment reads:
Page 5, clause 8, line 35: Immediately
after paragraph (b) of subclause 3, clause
8, add the following:
"(4) Notwithstanding anything in this
Act or the regulations, a person described
in subclause (2) shall not be requested to
submit to being vaccinated against any
infectious or contagious disease if
(a) it is apparent to the quarantine officer
that such person should not be vaccinated; or
(b) the quarantine officer bas been
informed that there are medical reasons
for such person not being vaccinated and
is of the opinion that such person should
not be vaccinated."
I think that clarifies the question Senator
Roebuck asked in committee, and it also puts
the department in better position. For example, if an individual travelling on a plane or
in some other conveyance had an infectious
disease such as typhoid fever or smallpox,
they would request that that individual be

SENATE DEBATES

undertaken must always bear the approval
of Parliament, in general terms or specifically. This question was raised some time
after World War 1, when the practice was
developed of the Government undertaking
to submit all major treaties to Parliament.
In 1922 or thereabouts a modification in this
practice was observed. This caused only
major political contractual obligations to be
tabled in Parliament to receive approval
either before or after ratification. Commercial
arrangements would be tabled in this way.
Indeed, one Prime Minister said that he
would not agree to the ratification of any
political treaty of a major kind without first
having obtained the consent of Parliament.
Parliament's time these days is taken up with
many matters and the situation has developed, as I well know, of there not being enough
time in one of the Houses of Parliament for
discussion or for a record beyond the mere
tabling of international obligations incurred
by Canada. Having talked this matter over
with the Leader of the Opposition, I believe
that in the Senate, after the tabling of a
document which involves a contractual obligation by Canada with another country or
countries, an explanation should be given and
comments made on that explanation by honourable senators, should they be so disposed.
With regard to major treaties, such as the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization and our
obligations under the charter of the United
Nations, a government would be wise, even
before ratification by executive act, to obtain
the approval of Parliament. This is by way of
preliminary observation. I wish to offer an
explanation concerning the convention signed
by Canada in Tokyo in 1963, ratified by the
Goverrnent of Canada on November 6, 1969,
and tabled in the Senate on December 2, 1969.
Hon. Mr. Grosart: Would the honourable
Leader of the Government permit a question?
Agreeing entirely with his general proposition that a document of this type should be
debated in this chamber, would he consider it
advisable to withhold his explanation until
the senators have the document before them?
Hon. Mr. Martin: The document was tabled
on December 2. I have no reluctance in deferring my comments now. The convention is
available for senators to examine. I think it is
a reasonable request, and I will recognize it at
once. I will proceed on Tuesday.

Hon. Mr. Grosart: My intention was not to
suggest that the honourable senator might not
proceed now. I was speaking rather to the
principle. If the honourable senator wishes to
go on now, it will certainly not be the first
time that we have heard discussion on a
document that was not before us. I would
suggest that in the future it would be wise for
us to have the document and to be advised
that at this point in our proceedings it will be
discussed.
Hon. Mr. Martin: I want it to be clearly
understood that the document is tabled. It
was tabled on December 2, 1969. The reason I
delayed making a statement at that time was
so that honourable members would have a
chance to examine the treaty and be prepared
for discussion. I am so anxious that this practice be established that I think I would prefer
not to go on with my statement, but give
honourable senators an opportunity to look at
the convention and, if they wish, to comment
on it. I would prefer to do that rather than go
on today.
I feel that there are obligations of varying
import made by governments in our busy,
complicated world. To table conventions without comment seems to me undesirable. I
found this particularly so when I was in the
other place as Secretary of State for External
Affairs. It was just not possible because of
the planning of the program of Parliament to
rise from time to time to make explanations
of documents involving commitments made by
Canada on important matters. Some matters
must obviously, in the nature of our constitutional custom, be discussed by Parliament,
even before ratification, there being no obligation on the part of the executive to delay
ratification until it has received the approval
of Parliament. Parliament always bas the
right to express its view on foreign policy. It
may register its opposition to a particular
treaty after it has been ratified. But in important matters, I think the course being followed by the present Government is the correct one.
I thought that in the Senate, where we
have admittedly more time, where it was
desirable that Parliament should be seized
with such matters, we might develop the
practice, which I hope we might begin, if not
today, then by way of formal explanation
next Tuesday night.
Hon. Mr. Haig: If the Leader of the Government tables a document on, say, December

or three days or a week later, could he not
request that the document be printed as an
appendix to Hansard? Then we would know
be would be speaking to it on December 10,
and we would have some opportunity to
study it.
Hon. Jacques Flynn: I think there may be
some confusion here. The tabling of a document may be the occasion for the Leader of
the Government and other members of the
Senate to comment upon it. I think what the
Leader of the Government has in mind is a
new role for the Senate in matters concerning
international treaties, Perhaps the present
debate would not be limited to this convention, which was, as be said, ratified by the
Government two or three weeks ago, but also
on what in future the Senate should do about
such treaties or conventions, how the Senate
should deal with them, whether the Senate
should refer them to the Standing Senate
Committee on Foreign Affairs, so that we
have some kind of ratification by the Senate
in cases where Parliament as a whole is not
called upon to ratify a treaty. These are the
questions the Leader of the Government has
raised, and they are distinct from the immediate problem of this convention, which deals
with "hijacking", and other matters.
In order to try to adjust our guns and
dissipate confusion, perhaps the Government
Leader could adjourn this item until next
Tuesday, when he could make a formal
motion to refer the question of the ratification
of treaties to the Standing Senate Committee
on Foreign Affairs, and at the same time deal
with this item. I do not think the mere
tabling of a document is in the ordinary
course of our business something so important
as to require long prior notice.

December 10, 1969

I think the suggestion of the Leader of the
Opposition-which be made to me privately
and which I had forgotten-that we might
send these documents to the Standing Senate
Committee on Foreign Affairs for tabling by
them, or for consideration, depending on their
desire and their work program, is a good one.
However, I would like to make clear that
there is no obligation on the part of the Government of Canada to obtain the consent of
Parliament before it ratifies a convention or
treaty.

Hon. Mr. Martin: There is, of course, an

made on behalf of the nation.
I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his
suggestions. I think we might observe them.
With this in mind, I will withhold the brief
comments I was going to make until Tuesday
next.
We have not really met the point made by
Senator Haig in this particular case. Would it
be agreeable to incorporate the convention in
today's Hansard, so that all honourable senators would have it for scrutiny before Tuesday next?

JUDGES ACT
BILL TO AMEND-SECOND

READING

Hon. J. Harper Prowse moved the second
reading of Bill C-2, to amend the Judges Act.
He said: Honourable senators, this is a very
simple bill to explain and I will try to keep it
that way. It provides merely for the appointment of two judges to the Supreme Court of
Alberta, five judges to the County and District Courts of Ontario, and one judge to the
District Court of Alberta.
The part in which you may be interested
and which I think is important at this time is
this: As you know, the authority for the
vacancies is provided by provincial legislation, but the actual provision for the appointment for salaries is federal. The order in
council providing for the appointments for
the payment of district court judges in Alberta was passed February 11 of this year. The
arrangement for the increase of two more
appointments to the Supreme Court was
made on April 21, and royal assent was given
to the Ontario legislation to provide for the
five additional judges which they need on
March 26. It has been certified in the other
place by the Minister of Justice that investigations by his department satisfy him that
these are necessary. As a senator from Alberta, I can tell you that we need the extra
judges there to get the business done.
Honourable senators, I do not propose to
move that this bill be sent to a committee but
rather, if it is given second reading today, I
shall move, with leave, that it be given third
reading.
Hon. Walter M. Aselline: Honourable senators, as has been stated by the sponsor of Bill
C-2, an act to amend the Judges Act, it
appears to be a very simple matter. It occupies only part of one printed page. Even
though it is a comparatively simple matter, it
is nevertheless very important.
From information I have obtained, there is
a big backlog of cases on the dockets of the
different provinces, which have never been
dealt with because we have not enough
judges in those provinces. When you read the
[Hon. Mr. Fournier (Madawaska-Restigouche).]

December 10, 1969

law reports, you find that cases started three
or four years ago are just being dealt with
now, and you are reading the judgments. This
should not happen in this great country of
ours. That is the reason why this bill is
before us now.

The Province of Alberta is short of judges.
At the present moment there are nine
supreme court judges; they want two more;
and an order in council has been passed, as
has been stated.
The district courts of the Province of
Alberta at the present time have 14 judges;
they want one more; and an order in council
has been passed to provide for another judge.
As far as I know, there are eight district court judges in the northern part of
Alberta and six in the southern part; they
need one more. This would make a total of 15
district court judges in the Province of Alberta. At the present time eight district court
judges reside in Edmonton, four in Calgary
and two in Lethbridge. When the additional
judge is appointed, they will have seven in
the southern part and eight in the northern
part, making up the total of 15.
In Saskatchewan we allocate our judges,
one to each judicial district, or "judicial centre" as we call them now; but the judges
have jurisdiction to take cases in different
parts of the province.
The Province of Ontario has 89 county
court judges and has given notice that they
require five more. That is another reason why
this bill is before us. They want four in the
County of York and one in the County of
Carleton; and Ontario has passed the necessary legislation.
District court judges get $19,000 a year. A
supreme court judge in Alberta gets $26,000 a
year. They actually do not have that much
take-home pay, because the whole stipend
that a judge is entitled to is subject to income
tax. His take-home pay does not leave him
too much money to live on, according to his
station in life.
Judges' widows get two-ninths of twothirds of the judge's salary, which is not a
very large amount. It would amount to
about $2,600 for the widow of a district
court judge and about $3,300 for the widow of
a supreme court judge. That is really all the
bill is about.
Honourable senators, in order to fill these
positions, judges must be appointed. We do
not select judges as they do in the United
States. There they elect their judges-except

in the Supreme Court of the United States. In
Canada our judges are appointed. Quite frequently our judges are chosen from among
those who have been involved in politics for
quite a number of years. At one tirne I
thought I probably would have been made a
judge.
Hon. Mr. Martin: You would have been a
very good one.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: It happened that, instead
of being made a judge, I was summoned to
become a member of the Senate of Canada.
Therefore, we will neyer know whether or
not it was a great loss to the country that I
did not become a judge.
Han. Mr. Roebuck: It has been a gain.

I had any reason to complain of discrimination because the judge in a particular case
belonged to a political party to which I did
not belong.
Ail things being equal, therefore, I have no
objection whatever to Government supporters
being appointed to the bench. I do think,
however, that the Minister of Justice, who is
responsible for the appointment of judges by
the Governor in Council, should take particular care to get the right person to take the
office. I understand that the Canadian Bar
Association recommends it be consulted, and
I know that the provincial bar associations
have made similar requests.

Bar Association and with the provincial bar
associations, as well as with the members of
the bar and even sometirnes the members of
the bench, before making an appointinent.
Honourable senators, I should like to say a
few words on the question of the jurisdiction
of district court judges and county court
judges in respect of divorce matters. We discussed that quite fully when the divorce
legisiation came before us in 1968. 1, for one,
advocated giving jurisdiction in divorce matters to both superior and district courts. The
reasons for asking district courts to be included should be obvious. It is a question of
congestion. In the three provinces about
which I know the most, namely, Saskatchewan, Alberta and British Columbia, the
courts are congested with divorce cases. In
fact, in every province in the west, with the
exception of British Columbia, divorce cases
are tried in the superior court. In the province of British Columbia, however, there is
some arrangement by which the district court
judges are given concurrent jurisdiction in
order to hear, try, and dispose of divorce
matters under the new law.
Perhaps something could be done to alleviate the difficulties in the other provinces by
enabling district and county court judges to be
given the necessary divorce jurisdiction. I
think we must do this, if the backlog of cases
is to be deait with expeditiously.
Honourable senators, I see no reason for
sending this bull to committee, unless it is
your wish to consider somne of the side issues
I have mentioned. I hope it is obvious from
what I have said that; I agree with the legisiation. I think it is important and that it should
corne into effect irnmediately, or at least as
soon as possible, so that these judges can be
appointed and take Up the backlog of cases
which we have in almost every province in
Canada.
It is my wish that the bill be given second
reading now.

Han. Harry A. Willis: Honourable senators,
I should like to point out briefiy that in the
last 12 years Ontario has neyer had a better
judiciary than it has at the present trne, and
this applies to appointments by both governments.
I should also like to pay a tribute to the

21498-21J

SENATE DEBATES
Hon. Arthur W. Roebuck: Honourable senators, I thank Senator Aseltine for the information he has given us and the comments he
has made. As far as appointing people who
have taken part in political matters is concerned, there are those who hold the view
that when a person takes an interest in his
country he automatically disqualifies himself
from sitting on the bench. I do not go along
with that point of view at all. It is most
unjust. For example, I heard of a case in
England where two men were contending for
the appointment; one had never taken part in
politics, but the other had. The minister
chose the person who had never been in politics, and I thought that that was a great mistake. The person who had been interested in
his country, and had spent his time in demonstrating his concern for the welfare of his
fellow citizens, was excluded from the bench
for that reason.
I am not at all afraid of appointments of
people with political experience. I do not care
which side of politics they are on.
My friend says he has been at the bar for a
very long time; in fact 56 years. I, too, have
been at the bar a long time, although not
quite. so long. I have on the wall of my office
a certificate of which I am rather proud, for
it declares that I have been in good standing
at the bar for 50 years. It is now 52 years. In
my experience over that long time I have
found that the question of the political party
to which one belongs never arises in the
course of the business of the courts.
Hon. Mr. Asel±ine: That is right.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: That bas been my
experience. I have never cared whether I
appeared before a Liberal judge or a Conservative judge. I do not think my political
affiliation would have made any difference in
any case I ever pleaded.
I have had some experience too in presiding, because for many years, as honourable
senators know, we decided many, many cases
in the committee rooms of this bouse and the
thought of politics never entered our minds.
We were the judges of both parties and the
question of politics never came up. This bas
always been the case whether we were judges
or advocates. So there is nothing to this criticism of appointing political war horses to
the bench.
Another point I will bring to the attention
of honourable senators is that the Minister of
Justice asks for the advice of the Bar
[Hon. Mr. Willis.]

December 10, 1969

Association and this, in my opinion, is perfectly in order. The Bar Association and its
officials keep a comprehensive record, and if
there is any reason why a person should not
be appointed, it is most important that the
authorities should know that reason. A man's
good record is a very important factor in the
consideration of his qualifications.
My honourable friend who sponsored the
bill bas suggested that we should pass it now
without sending it to a committee. I am quite
prepared to agree to that. I am perfectly satisfied that the Minister of Justice knows the
need for the additional judges in my own

PRAIRIE GRAIN PROVISIONAL
PAYMENTS BILL, 1969-1970
SECOND

READING-DEBATE

ADJOURNED

Hon. Herberi O. Sparrow moved the
second reading of Bill C-157, to authorize
provisional payments for the 1969-70 crop
year in respect of unthreshed grain in the
prairie provinces.
He said: Honourable senators, I appreciate
the opportunity given to me to present this
bill for your consideration. The measures
proposed fill a very great need and will be
appreciated greatly by the farmers of western
Canada. Its purpose is to enable grain producers to obtain advance payments on unthreshed
grain in western Canada.
Basically, this bill extends the provisions of
the Prairie Grain Advance Payments Act. On
October 30, 1968, I presented in this chamber
amendments to that act, and at that time I
felt that I had explained in some detail its
provisions and its amendments. Therefore, I
do not wish at this time to go into great detail
in further explanations of the act other than
to refer to some of its highlights in relation to
the bill before us today.

December 10, 1969

SENATE
SNT DEBATES

As honourable senators are aware, where
farmers are unable ta deliver grain to an
elevator on a quota basis because the quota is
flot open for that delivery, provision is made
for the farmers ta receive advance payments
on farm-harvested and farm-stored grain. The
amounts available are based on six bushels
per cultivated acre at the rate of $1 per
bushel af wheat, 70 cents per bushel of
barley, and 40 cents per bushel of oats. The
maximum total sum available under the act is
$6,000 which would represent 6,000 bushels af
wheat delivered ta the elevator, which in turn
would mean that a farmer, ta receive the
maximum, would have ta have at least 1,000
acres of land under cultivation.
When a farmer delivers grain ta the elevator when the quota is open, and assuming
that the value of the initial payment for one
bushel of wheat is $1.50, the farmer pays
back the advance payment on the basis af
haîf that amount or 75 cents as a payment
towards his advance, and receives 75 cents in
cash. This is equally true with any af the
other grains on the saine basis, keeping i
mind of course that the price is less. He
receives haîf the amount af the initial payment, and haîf the amount goes ta pay his
advance. As mentioned previously, the advance payments are interest-free until paid
and are extended ta the end af the crop year.
Total advances under the Advance Payments
Act at this particular date are $231,446,136.
As I have already mentioned, the Prairie
Grain Advance Payments Act permits advances ta be made only on farm-stored grain.
The bill before us extends the provisions af
this act, in the forin of a new act, ta unharvested grain, assuming that the Canadian
fariner applies for an advance payment on
unharvested grain before May 1, 1970. As
most honourable senators are aware, the conditions in western Canada this fail have been
adverse as far as the farmer is concerned, and
there is stili a considerable amounit of grain
in the field, either standing or in the swath,
which it has not been possible ta harvest.
Measures similar ta those proposed in this bill
were extended ta the prairie farmers ten
years ago under like conditions.
The amaunt advanced ten years ago was $1
million. I do not know, s0 I cannot advlse, nor
can anyone advise me, as ta what can be
expected in the way of amouints that may be
advanced on this basis until May 1, 1970. 1
use that figure with the second figure of $271,
which represents the total loss experienced by

the advance of $1 million ta the prairie fariners 10 years ago. With that type of record
before them, I amn sure honourable senatars
can be assured that the loss on this type of
advance will certainly be minimal.
The advance on the unthreshed grain
should not increase the total amount that
would have been advanced had the crop been
harvested and put in farm storage. Those who
require imnmediate funds now would have
required thein whether the grain was
threshed or unthreshed, sa it should flot
extend the overail amount required for advance payments.
The Prairie Grain Advance Payments Act
provides; that a farmer may borrow up ta,
$6,000 as an advance on his crop. The provisions i this bill permit $3,000 ta be borrowed
under the Advance Payments Act on threshed
grain and $3,000 on unthreshed grain. In fact,
this bill alone permits an advance payment af
only $3,000 on unharvested grain. Sa, in fact,
if a fariner has a previaus year's crop or
would have threshed saine af that crop, he
cnborrow up ta $3,000 on that and $3,000 an
the unharvested portion.
Honourable senators, I feel there is saine
urgency ini passing: this bill, urgency on the part
af the prairie fariner who is finding himself
lin a pinch with respect ta operating capital.
I do not wish ta go inta detail concerning the
probleins af the western fariner at titis tinxe
because 1 believe mast of you are aware af
thein, and I certainly know you are ail sym.pathetic towards the fariner.
Hon. Mr. Fournier <Madawaska-ResIigauche): Have we any hope of salvage on titis
unthreshed grain, or are we paying advances
on something that might not be saved?
Han. Mr. Sparrow: I believe the gamble is
good. We have had previaus experience-as I
mentioned, 10 years ago--with crops in the
saine condition being taken off the foilowing
spring in good condition. Ahnost every year
in the western provinces a portion ai the crap
is le! t in the fields because of adverse weather conditions and is taken off, normally without damage, the following spring. Last year
the farmers were in desperate need af money
when conditions were similar ta those being

obtain this, it was necessary that they have
the grain in bins. Sa, they extended their

review the outlook for production and
marketing and to make recommendations
as to the most suitable programs for their
respective provinces.
The various papers and discussions at the
main Outlook Conference indicated the
following:
Wheat-At average yields, 20 million
acres would produce all the wheat predicted to be marketable from farms in 1970-71.
Oats-Some reduction in oats below the
1969 area of 7.9 million acres towards an
annual level of about 6.5 million acres
would provide sufficient supplies for
1970-71.
Barley-At average yields an area of 9.0
million acres would be sufficient supplies
for 1970-71.
Flax-An acreage reduction in flax from
the 1969 level of 2.4 million acres to a level
of 1.5 to 2.0 million acres is indicated for
each of the next two years, unless producers are prepared to accept lower prices.
Rapeseed-It would appear desirable that
for 1970, rapeseed acreage be maintained at
about 2.2 million acres. An increase in production over the next 5 years will be justified by continued increases in domestic use
and exports. However, prices are likely to
fall well below 1969 levels in 1970-71, if
production in 1970 substantially exceeds 40
million bushels.
Beef-The outlook for beef production
indicates an increasing demand which will
support a build-up in the national beeffeeding herd.
Hogs-There appears to be an outlet for
about one million additional hogs per year
for domestic and export markets.
Eggs-There is a strong possibility that
the shell egg market will be over-produced
in the first half of 1970, with a corresponding drop in egg prices to producers which
will persist until layer numbers decline.

Hon. Paul Martin: Answered.
(The answers follow:)
Agricultural production is the responsibility of provincial governments. The policy
followed by the federal Government, working in close co-operation with the provincial authorities and farm organizations, is
to endeavour by way of an annual Outlook

crops and livestock.

DIVORCE

Han. Arthur W. Roebuck: Honourable senators, may I ask of the Governrnent if and
when we can expect from the Government an
amendment ta the Divorce Act, which came
into force on July 2, 1968, which will confer
upon the county courts of the provinces jurisdiction in divorce co-ordinate with that of the
Supreme Courts, as recommended in June
1967 in the Report of the Special Joint Coinmittee of the Senate and House of Commons;
on Divorce.

SENATE DEBATES
May I refer to the paragraph in question? It
appears under the heading "Court Jurisdiction," and reads:
In the Divorce Act (Ontario), which
conferred authority to decree dissolution
of marriage, and in the pre-Confederation
statutes in the provinces other than
Quebec and Newfoundland, it was uniformly the Supreme or Superior Court
which was selected to administer the law
of divorce. In the experience in Ontario
of almost forty years and in the other
provinces of the past one hundred years,
the Supreme Courts have proven in some
respects inadequate for the task. The
Judges of the Supreme Courts visit
the county towns, other than the cities,
usually twice a year, so that long lists of
divorce cases await the Assizes and are
dealt with perfunctorily. They are run
through rapidly as something of a nuisance in order that the more interesting
and financially important actions may be
heard.
Moreover, such matrimonial and family
matters.
proceedings are continuing
While the marriage itself may be permanently and decisively disposed of, matters
such as the division of marital property,
alimony and the custody and maintenance of the children remain to be dealt
with from time to time. To reach the
judge who made the original order
involves a trip to the provincial capital or
a wait for a maximum of six months for
the next Assizes, when unfortunately a
different judge may be sitting.
To meet this obvious difficulty, the
former Chief Justice of Ontario, the
Honourable James McRuer, advised that
the County Courts be given concurrent
jurisdiction with the Supreme Court in
matters of divorce. The County Court
Judges are resident in the county towns
and their local offices and officials are
available at all times. The judges are present when required to explain or vary an
order or to make additional provisions.
Chief Justice McRuer spoke from his
own long experience of the Supreme
Court when speaking of the obvious
advantage of having matrimonial matters
dealt with by local judges. He would not
interfere with the present authority of
the Supreme Court Bench.

the honourable Senator Roebuck has leave to
proceed with the laying of a foundation for
his question?
Hon. Senators: Agreed.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: I regret having to take
up this amount of time, but to make my
question abundantly clear it is necessary that
I read this section of the report and the
recommendation, because I am asking whether and when this recommendation will be put
into effect. If I may, I shall continue.
Divorce litigants should have access to
the Supreme Court if they wished a High
Court trial, as they are now in cases
beyond the jurisdiction of the County
Courts, but neither should the great
advantage of the County Courts be
denied them. Your committee has had
recommendations
that
Matrimonial
Causes be sent to family courts. This is a
matter that could be left to conferences
between the Minister of Justice and Provincial Attorneys General because of the
lack of uniformity in such courts at
present.
Your committee recommends that the
County Courts of all provinces having
jurisdiction to dissolve marriage be given
jurisdiction in divorce equally and concurrently with the Supreme Courts of the
respective provinces.

In the Divorce Act, section 2, subsection (e)
the "Court" constituted by the act to hear
divorce cases is defined for the various provinces, as the trial division of the Supreme
Court of the provinces of Ontario, Nova
Scotia, New Brunswick, Alberta, British
Columbia and Prince Edward Island. In the
provinces of Manitoba and Saskatchewan, it
is the Court of Queen's Bench and in the
Yukon Territory and the Northwest Territories, the Territorial Courts.
Section 22 defines the court so empowered
for the provinces of Quebec and Newfoundland, following a proclamation, as the Superior Court of Quebec, and the Supreme Court
of Newfoundland. I understand that such
proclamations have been issued for both these
provinces.
By sections 3 and 4 of the Divorce Act, a
Petition for Divorce may be presented to a
"Court," which is a court as defined in section 2.
The Hon. the Speaker: Order. I wish to

SENATE DEBATES

desirability of having the jurisprudence with
respect to divorce under the new act settled
by the Supreme Courts of the provinces
rather than by the County Courts. However,
more than a year bas passed since the proclamation of the new Divorce Act, and more
than 38,000 petitions for divorce have been
received by the courts of the provinces during
the first year of operation of the act.
In view of the congestion in the Supreme
Courts and the other reasons mentioned in
the report of the joint committee, is it not
now time to give co-ordinate jurisdiction in
matters of divorce in the county or local
courts of the provinces?
Hon. Mr. Martin: Honourable senators,
Senator Roebuck was kind enough to give me
notice of his intention to ask this question.
Having consulted the Minister of Justice, in response I would say that, as Senator
Roebuck knows, it was thought preferable at
the time the new Divorce Act was introduced
to place divorce jurisdiction in the superior
court of each province. This was decided
partly because the jurisdiction of such courts
is a provincial responsibility rather than a
local responsibility, and partly because it was
thought that until some jurisprudence based
on the new law was established jurisdiction
should be restricted to the superior court
judges.
However, I must make clear, as I am sure
Senator Roebuck fully appreciates, that federal legislation is not required to enable county
court judges to hear divorce cases in their
respective provinces. In some provinces
county or district court judges do hear
divorce cases as local judges of the superior
court. It would be within the competence of
the provincial authorities of any province to
extend divorce jurisdiction to county court
judges in their capacity as local judges of the
superior court.
In respect of the backlog of cases to which
we have been referred by Senator Roebuck, I
understand that in the Province of Ontario
various methods, such as special divorce hearings of the high court, are being considered to
deal with the problem.
Finally, the Minister of Justice in his
remarks to the Canadian Bar Association earlier this fall, indicated that the Divorce Act
would be reviewed in the fall of 1970. The
question raised by Senator Roebuck could
certainly be considered at that time as part
of that review.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Thank you.

Hon. Jacques Flynn: Mr. Speaker, I did not
intervene when this question was posed, nor
when the answer was given, because I
thought that by giving leave to Senator
Roebuck and the Leader of the Government I
could prove my point, that if we are going to
institute a worthwhile question period, questions should be short and so should the
answers, otherwise we will engage in a
debate. I could say much about the question
that has been debated between the two
honourable senators opposite. Let me simply
say that I think the question was completely
out of order, and so was the answer. What
Senator Roebuck was asking the Government
was: Why did the Government not listen to
the report of the Divorce Committee or to the
suggestions made by the opposition at that
time?
The Hon. the Speaker: May I say a word
for the benefit of the Leader of the Opposition (Hon. Mr. Flynn). In his exposé, the
honourable Senator Roebuck drew attention
to the fact that this was a necessarily, lengthy
presentation. I do not think we should
encourage this kind of question, otherwise it
may degenerate into a debate. That is why I
asked if the honourable senator had unanimous consent to proceed, and I understood
that consent was given.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: Mr. Speaker, with all due
respect, there cannot be unanimous consent in
such a case.
AIR TRAFFIC
THREATENED STRIKE BY AIR CONTROLLERSQUESTION AND ANSWER
Hon. J. Campbell Haig: Honourable senators, may I ask the Leader of the Government
a question?
Has the Government Leader any further
information about the negotiations between
the Air Controllers Association and the Treasury Board with a view to averting a possible
strike on Friday next?
Hon. Paul Martin: Honourable senators, I
can add nothing more to what the President
of the Treasury Board and the Minister of
Transport said earlier today, that talks are
taking place between those representing the
controllers and the Treasury Board, and
every effort is being made to bring about a
satisfactory conclusion. Beyond that, it is not
possible to go at this stage.
Hon. Mr. Croll: Your best hope is to go
home on Thursday.

I am concerned about thousands of others.
UNION STATION
RENOVATION OF BUILDING-QUESTIONS
ANSWERED

Hon. Paul Martin: Honourable senators,
last week, Senator Fournier (MadawaskeRestigouche), asked some questions to which I
gave some responses, which obviously were
not complete, and I agreed to give him a more
complete reply.
His questions were as follows: "1. Did the
Federal Government make any expenditures
towards the renovation of the old Union Station?" The answer is, Yes.
2. "If yes, what was the total amount
spent?" The answer is, $625,000.
3. "Under what authority was it done, and
who recommended it to be done?" The
answer is, under authority of the Cabinet, as
recommended by the Privy Council.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: The Privy Council?
Hon. Mr. Martin: Yes-the Office of the
Privy Council, which is in charge of the Federal-Provincial Relations Conference.
4. "Who is now the owner of this building?"
The answer is: The building is Crown-owned
and is leased by the National Capital Commission to the Department of Public Works
for $1 per annum.

Hon. Mr. Cameron: Honourable senators,
all I want to say in the second part of this
question is that the air controllers and the
postal people have constantly declared that
those responsible for the delays are the
people in the Treasury Board. My question to
the Leader of the Government is, cannot
something be done to get a more expeditious
settlement of some of these admittedly complex problems?
Hon. Mr. Flynn: I think the questions have
been asked. I would like to hear the answer.
Hon. Mr. Martin: With regard to the second
portion of the question, I would remind
honourable senators that in the Speech from
the Throne the Government gave indication
of its intention to introduce a measure dealing with particular situations that very clearly involve the public interest. Beyond that, I
do not now wish to make further comment. I
have said that talks are going on today. If we
want them to conclude successfully I think we
should leave the negotiators untrammeled by
anything we say at this time.

Hon. Donald Cameron: This is really supplementary to the question asked by Senator
Haig, which has to do with the threatened
strike by the air controllers. I wonder if the
Leader of the Government has seen tonight's
Ottawa Citizen in which the president of that
association in effect makes a threat to the
Government. I quote:
He warned the Government against
trying to use military air controllers to
replace civilians at Department of Transport airports. He said they were not fully
qualified for the DOT posts.

Hon. Donald Smith, for Hon. Leopold Langlois, moved the third reading of Bill C-169,

more effective means of deterring the hijacking of aircraft. Within ICAO, Canada has
played a major role in the legal subcommittee
formed to draft an international agreement to
deal specifically with hijacking. This subcommittee bas already developed a draft agreement which, after further examination and
possible modification, will be submitted to an
international conference for adoption. In the
United Nations, Canada will do all that it can
to have the General Assembly formally urge
its members to take all possible measures to
prevent the hijacking of aircraft and to
punish offenders.
The development of international law, as a
means of ensuring the orderly conduct of
international affairs, has always been one of
the fundamental objectives of Canadian
foreign policy. Because of the enormous
increase in recent years in the number of
people who travel by air, there are few areas
of international activity which so directly
concern people in all walks of life as the
security of international civil air travel.
Canada has in the past done, and will continue in the future to do, everything possible
to develop and maintain the rule of law in
this activity which directly affects so many
of our citizens.
Honourable senators, when I was discussing
this matter with the Leader of the Opposition,
be made the suggestion that this explanation
of conventions would be a desirable pattern.
He also suggested that we might refer these
matters to the Standing Senate Committee on
Foreign Affairs. This I propose to do.
Hon. Jacques Flynn: Honourable senators,
the statement of the Leader of the Government, of which be gave us a part on Wednesday last, and which he has completed today,
raises two questions.
There is a problem of rules. What should
we do when a document of this type is tabled
before the Senate? Should there be a prior
notice, as when we give notice of an inquiry,
and then should we have a debate on it?
There is another question implicit in the
statement of the Leader of the Government,
dealing with the ratification of a treaty. The
leader has indicated that it is not necessary
under our Constitution-written or unwritten,
and I do not know on which basis the argument would be put-to have Parliament
ratify a treaty. I know that in practice important international conventions have been ratified by Parliament but, generally speaking,
this is not the procedure followed.
[Hon. Mr. Martin.]

December 16, 1969

Hon. Mr. Martin: That is right.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: And I understand that in
the present case that procedure has been followed. The convention was signed in 1963 and
I assume that the persons signing it on behalf
of Canada had the authorization of Cabinet.
Hon. Mr. Martin: They had authorization to
sign.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: Then what the Leader of
the Government calls the instrument of ratification is nothing more than another order in
council which says, "We will ratify it."
Hon. Mr. Martin: That is right.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: So, there are two decisions
of the Government. I do not understand why
the Government should decide twice to sign a
treaty. To me, it seems rather silly.
Hon. Mr. Martin: There are not two separate orders in council to sign the treaty. The
first order in council authorizes the representative of the country to sign the treaty, but
a treaty signed does not necessarily have to be
ratified. That requires a subsequent act on the
part of the executive.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: Then the signature does
not mean a thing.
Hon. Mr. Martin: It is a commitment.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: I repeat that it is silly. I
suggest, therefore, that this is a problem with
regard to ratification of treaties that we could
study in the Standing Senate Committee on
Foreign Aff airs in order to see how we should
deal with these matters. These are two problems that arise out of the statement of the
Government Leader.
As far as this particular convention is concerned, one could make the comment that,
since it bas been published in its entirety in
the Minutes of the Proceedings of last
Wednesday, it is therefore up to every
member of the Senate to read it and to assess
its value. I agree that it is an important and
necessary step to prevent the offence of
hijacking. However, it is well known, I
believe, that 90 per cent of the cases of hijacking resulted in the aircraft being taken to
Cuba. Moreover, if my understanding is correct, Cuba has not signed the convention.
Therefore, in practice it is not very important.
It is important in principle, because we have
laid down the rules; but, in practice, if Cuba
does not sign and if we continued to have a
high percentage of the aircraft being hijacked

Committee might well consider whatever constitutional or other amendments might be

Hon. Arthur W. Roebuck: Honourable
senators, I have no wish to pose as an
authority on constitutional law, although I
suppose I have as much right to do so as any
member of this chamber. But I do hope that
if the Foreign Affairs Committee considers
this question of treaties and their binding
effect, they will obtain the views of some
very well-informed authorities on international law. While I hesitate to disagree with
the honourable senator who has just spoken, I
think that he has perhaps lost sight of some
features of this situation.
The right of the Crown to bind the nation
goes back into ancient history. The King had
that right and the executive has it today with
this qualification only, that if the enforcing of
the agreement that has been made by the
executive requires some amendment to the
law, some expenditure of money or a change
of the statutes, then the executive bas to
come to Parliament, and if Parliament refuses
to make a change in the law, then it is just too
bad for the executive. But apart from this, to
say that the executive cannot bind the nation
is, in my opinion, erroneous. It has always
been done; it is being done today.
I do not know the law of the United States,
but I am under the impression that the
ancient law with regard to the making of
treaties by the executive was changed in the
American Constitution, and the right of the
President acting in the capacity of the King
in England was limited by the necessity of
having his act approved by the Senate. I
think that is provided for in the Constitution
of the United States. But there is no such
provision in the Constitution of Canada; there
is nothing in the B.N.A. Act which says that
the executive cannot bind the nation. But I
know that the executive cannot pass laws
within the jurisdiction of Parliament.
[Hon. Mr. Grosart.]

December 16, 1969

I think the statement was also made that
Canada does not have the complete power of
extra-territorial laws. That was the case
when the B.N.A. Act was passed, and we had
the impression at that time that Canada's
jurisdiction was limited to the three-mile area
beyond our shores.
Hon. Mr. Grosari: I am sure the honourable
senator will not mind my saying that I did
not raise that question at all. Any time he
wishes to discuss the question of extra-territorial laws, I shall be glad to discuss them
with him, but I did not raise it.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: I think the honourable
senator did so in effect when he said that the
executive did not have the power to make
laws binding Canada outside its own
jurisdiction.
Hon. Mr. Grosari: I did not say extra-territorial. That is an entirely different matter.
What I was speaking about was the relationship between sections 91 and 92 of the British
North America Act which are very much
intra-territorial matters as opposed to extraterritorial matters.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: We are agreed on that,
and it has been perfectly clear since the conference in 1926 that we have the power to
bind this nation by an agreement with another nation that goes beyond our ordinary
boundaries, with the exception only that if it
requires an Act of Parliament to enforce the
terms of the agreement, then Parliament must
pass such an act.
Hon. Mr. Grosart: Or an act of a provincial
legislature. That is the point I was making.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Very well, if it comes
within the jurisdiction of a province.
Hon. Mr. Martin: Honourable senators,
Senator Grosart asked me a question and as
the matter is one of some importance I should
like to supplement what Senator Roebuck has
just said.
The treaty-making power is an element of
the royal prerogative exercised by the Crown
on the advice of the executive. Senator Grosart may think that this is a device no longer
properly applicable in this modern day, but
that would be a complete reversal of our
constitutional law and of our concept of the
position of the Crown in relation to the formulation and execution of foreign policy. The
royal prerogative in Canada bas been delegated by the Crown to the Governor General in
Council, and is exercised by him on the

Decomber 16, 1969

SENATE DEBATES

advice of the executive in the Government of
Canada.
The policy enunciated in the 1920s respecting the submission of treaties by the Cabinet
to Parliament for approval by resolution has
gone through various and, I admit, sometimes
unclear applications. The present practice
seems to be that ratification is sought by Parliament only in respect of certain major
political international commitments such as
our adhesion to the North Atlantic Treaty, to
NORAD, to the treaty on Non-Proliferation
of Nuclear Weapons, and instruments of this
kind. The practice appears to have been to
seek parliamentary approval by resolution
only for the most important treaties. This was
reflected in an exchange between Mr. Brewin
in the other house and the then Prime Minister, Mr. Pearson, which appears in the
Hansard of the other place of March 11, 1968,
at page 7467. There Mr. Brewin observed:
My question is for the Prime Minister. In
view of the importance to Canada of current negotiations for the renewal of
NORAD will the right hon. gentleman

this house before it is signed?

abridgement of the executive's power to make
treaties, whether or not they operate under
the parliamentary system.
This question was dealt with by an officer
of this house in 1939. W. F. O'Connor, in a
report he made to the Honourable the Speaker of the Senate of Canada on the British
page
North America Act, 1867-(1939),
146-wrote of the nature of the royal prerogative in these terms:
By prerogative rights "we mean a right
that remains in the Sovereign as one of
that bundle of common law rights which
were, at and by the common law, exercisable by the Sovereign in person, and we
use that term whether the prerogative in
question is or is not now exercisable by
the Sovereign in person or through him
by his representative."

The royal prerogative includes the treatymaking power, as Senator Roebuck has just
emphasized. Professor Dawson, in his book
The Government of Canada, Fourth Edition
(1963), at page 158, wrote that the Royal Prerogative embraces:
-the power to do all acts of an international character, such as the declaration
of war and neutrality, the conclusion of

PRAIRIE GRAIN PROVISIONAL
PAYMENTS BILL, 1969-1970
SECOND READING-DEBATE

CONTINUED

The Senate resumed from Wednesday,
December 10, the adjourned debate on the
motion of Hon. Mr. Sparrow for the second
reading of Bill C-157, to authorize provisional
payments for the 1969-70 crop year in respect
of unthreshed grain in the Prairie provinces.
Hon. Arthur M. Pearson: Honourable senators, before I commence my remarks in
respect of this bill I should like to say that I
have great admiration for those honourable
senators who are members of the legal fraternity and who did not participate in the debate
we have just heard. I think they showed considerable restraint.
Honourable senators, I have nothing but
praise for this measure to provide provisional
payments to farmers who find themselves in
great difficulty by having on their hands
unthreshed grain due to the very inclement
weather last fall in western Canada. This bill
provides for payments up to $3,000. This is,
of course, very small, but it will certainly
help to cover part of the expense of the last
season's work.
However, our problem is not solved by
handing out money in the form of loans to
the western farmers. It will be solved by selling grain. Major trouble has also been
experienced in the shipment of grain, and this
has added to the farmers' difficulties, from
which they do not seem to be able to escape.

To add to their misery, they have such men
as the President of the Winnipeg Grain
Exchange, Mr. McWilliams, saying in a
speech in Regina that the wheat era is past.
This did untold damage to farm credit. Similar statements made by a number of other
organizations have seriously hurt the grain
farmer.
The Free Press Weekly of December 6,
1969 asked: What has happened to Canada's
wheat trade under the Wheat Board? It then
went on to state that the world trade in wheat
increased from 856 million bushels in the 1953
crop year to 1,792 million bushels in the 1967
crop year, and that Canada's share of this
world trade dropped from 30 per cent in 1953
to 19 per cent in 1967.
We have been reading for many weeks
about the tremendous surpluses of wheat in
the world. Those who make these statements
about the surplus of wheat are, so far as I am
concerned, talking through their hats.
In 1953 Canada had 31 per cent of the
world trade in oats, and in 1967 our share of
the market had dropped to 5 per cent. In 1953
we had 35 per cent of the world trade in
barley, and this had dropped in 1967 to 14 per
cent. I understand that there is a heavy
demand for oats and barley throughout the
world today, and yet we have very nearly lost
our markets for oats and barley. It seems to
me that these statements as to a surplus of
wheat are just excuses for not getting on with
the job of selling wheat.
As a result of the statements that have
been made, and the loss of grain sales, the
price of land has dropped considerably. In
fact, there have been practically no sales of
farm land in western Canada in the last eight
months or more.
Farmers in the west have experienced similar conditions more than once in my memory,
but there has always been a recovery of markets, and I see no reason why the market
cannot recover and, in fact, improve. This
could easily happen within the next twelve
months, due to climatie conditions in those
areas where the yield of large wheat acreages
may be cut because of dry weather or frost.
Honourable senators, in the 1920's a good
many farmers were gambling on the Winnipeg Grain Exchange. There were bucket
shops in many villages and in all the cities of
the west, and many farmers gambled everything they had, and lost. The Grain Exchange
got a very bad name throughout western
Canada.

SENATE DEBATES
In those days an organization of farmers in
Saskatchewan was promoting the idea of
orderly marketing. They were advocating the
pooling of all grains, and the setting up of a
central selling agency. This idea caught on
quickly, and it was because of this that the
three great pool elevator companies in Saskatchewan, Alberta, and Manitoba were
formed.
At first these pools sold their grain in the
regular market of that day through the Grain
Exchange, so that really all they could do was
to give what they said was better grades for
grain, and also give the farmers a sense of
security in causing them to feel that their
own organization was selling to the best
advantage. As a result of considerable agitation which culminated in 1935, the federal
Government set up the Canadian Wheat
Board, which was empowered to buy and sell
wheat and coarse grains for either local consumption or export. There was still an open
market for those who preferred to sell in that
way, but this was closed in 1943, during the
Second World War. The farmers in western
Canada felt they were really on the way
towards having an orderly market, which has
been the way of western Canada ever since
1935-40.
Finally, an agreement was reached by
which all major exporting countries agreed
on a maximum and minimum selling price for
wheat. Due to selfishness and a feeling of
need for more money for their own farmers,
some of these countries lately have made
deliveries outside this agreement. Gradually
the gentleman's agreement has been falling
apart, and our original theory of an orderly
market bas been broken down.
For this reason I think that our Wheat
Board needs to be re-activated. I am proposing that a world agency be started by our
Wheat Board to sell our wheat. The men in
this agency, who would be appointed by the
Wheat Board, would be remunerated on a
commission basis. They, in turn, would
appoint sub-agents who would also work on a
commission basis for this agency. In other
words, superintendents of agents would be
granted certain areas such as Southeast Asia,
India, Japan, Brazil, North Africa, and so on,
and they would be authorized to make deals
for the wheat as long as it was paid for by a
given time.
To assist these superintendents we would
establish warehouses in strategic locations
throughout the world. We would not have to
establish them all at the beginning, but we
[Hon. Mr. Pearson.]

December 16, 1969

could select one or two strategic points and
see how it worked out. The Wheat Board
would own the wheat in these warehouses,
which would be kept full all the time. This
would avoid having our grain held up at the
whim of Canadian labour or by transportation problems in our own country.
My idea is that this agency should work on
a commission basis. We have had enough
bureaucratic bodies set up on the backs of
farmers. I believe, that an agency selling on
commission would get out and work to the
advantage of the Wheat Board and of our
farmers. Such an agency would probe every
possible chance of making a sale, rather than
just saying: "Well, if they want this wheat,
they know where they can come and get it."
In the past year we have missed a number of
what might be considered small sales. This
was due to the fact that we had no active
agent in those particular areas, nor did we
have grain in strategic places.
This agency should advertise all possible
ways of using wheat, other than just making
flour for bread. The grain could be crushed,
and coarse biscuits made, which would help
the poor of these nations in Asia, et cetera.
They could buy five, 10, or 20 pounds of
wheat and crush it themselves for biscuit
making. It would be very much cheaper than
having it milled and made into bread.
I believe today that we are in great competition with some nations in selling our wheat,
and unless we take positive action we are
going to lose our hope of selling wheat to
Europe.
When I was in Germany just prior to the
formation of the European Common Market, I
was at a cocktail party with some businessmen and naturally our conversation got
around to wheat. These men were particularly
concerned about the role France was about to
play in this closed market with regard to
wheat consumption. The French were insistent
at that time that her partners in the Common
Market must take a certain number of tons of
French soft wheat. The French were subsidizing their producers of wheat heavily at this
time, and still do as a matter of fact. If they
could be sure of the market, then a great deal
of their submarginal land could be brought
under cultivation again. This is exactly what
has happened. So, now Canada is in fourth
position as an exporter of cereals. France has
superseded us and is now in second position.
I might add that the German businessmen
said that they preferred a certain amount of
Canadian hard wheat mixed with their own

December 16, 1969

SENATE DEBATES

type of wheat to make flour. They have had
to adjust their milling, of course, to the soft
wheat of France.
At the present time there is a possibility of
Britain gaining entrance to the Common
Market. Will the same situation as took place
between France and Germany occur? Britain
is one of our great importing countries, taking
something like 75 million to 100 million bushels a year. Will France insist on Britain
accepting their subsidized wheat? If they can
make the pressures strong enough, we shall.
lose our British market, which has been very
good for Canada.
An article by Arthur Blakely which
appeared in one of the Ottawa newspapers of
December 10, 1969, stated:
Asked if the Canadian Government had
made any specific proposals to the British
governiment in relation to the latest British application to join the Common
Market, Mr. Pepin replied: "No. We have
kept them very well informed what our
situation is, what our views are. We have
a commitment from them to keep us very
well informed on events-on developments-in the negotiations for entry. And
I think this is all you can ask-"
Is this what is called "orderly marketing",
which has been the watch-word of our pools,
Wheat Board and Government for years? Or
is France doing battle for our markets in an
all-out fight by using pressure on her partners
and would-be partners to gain control of all
European grain markets? I personally think
so. In my opinion it is time for our people to
awaken, before we lose all our markets to
France and the United States. Orderly markets may be our watchword, but it does not
seem to be the watchword of other grain
exporters. I hope the Government wll act.
Honourable senators, for these reasons I
think that we should form a central selling
agency, which will buy its grain from the
Canadian Wheat Board and establish agents
throughout the world on a commission basis
to sell our wheat. At the same time we should
always be ready to return to orderly marketing of grain whenever the other producers
are ready to do so.

Hon. Mr. Aseltine: One hundred per cent.
Hon. Mr. Argue: This legislation is important, well accepted and required. The necessity for this legislation is not quite as great as
when it was first considered a month or more
ago, because we have been most fortunate in
having some excellent weather on the prairies
in the last few weeks, so that a good deal of
grain that was out a month ago has since
been harvested. However, there is still some
acreage unharvested, and therefore this legislation is necessary.
I believe it was eighteen years ago, in 1951,
that legislation was first presented in the other
house by the Right Honourable C. D. Howe,
then Minister of Trade and Commerce, which
at that time provided governinent guarantees
to the banks lending money against
unthreshed grain. In that debate many speakers thought the Government was taking a
terrible risk with government funds in
guaranteeing bank loans against grain out
under the snow. Experience at that time and
since has shown that the farmers are very
ingenious; they have harvested their grain in
the spring, they have paid their loans, and
that legislation has proven of great value to
farmers and to the Canadian economy
generally.
In 1956 there was a tremendous debate in
the other place on the whole question of
interest-free cash advances. I think it was
during that debate that a good deal of progress was made towards the ultimate attainment of the type of legislation about which
we are speaking tonight, namely, interest-free
cash advances in an extraordinary situation
to farmers who have grain in store, or under
this legislation grain under the snow, and are
unable to obtain an income because of special
circumstances.
I was interested to read the speech of Senator Aseltine, who I think brings to this chamber an intimate knowledge of the grain situation. He makes a sensible contribution, and I
am sure that all honourable senators pay a
great deal of attention to what he says.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. Argue: I listened to Senator Pearson. He too is a man who comes from grainHon. Hazen Argue: Honourable senators, growing country, probably some of the best
this debate dealing with wheat is pretty much land in western Canada, and he too knows
a Saskatchewan debate in that I believe there the very difficult situation prevailing at this
are now four senators taking part in it, all of time. I am pleased to note that he has put
them being from Saskatchewan. If we could forward some ideas on how we might
hear from Senator McDonald and Senator endeavour to market larger quantities of this
grain. However, I would have to be convinced
Boucher it would be complete.

SENATE DEBATES
that the suggestion he made would result
automatically in any increase in the sale of
Canadian wheat. Personally, I think it is not
so much a question of salesmanship as of
things much more fundamental than that. It is
a question of accepting goods from other
countries, and the availability of grain supplies in other countries. Nevertheless, any
idea that is put forward should be considered,
and I hope the Government and the Wheat
Board are considering suggestions of the kind
made by Senator Pearson.
As honourable senators know, the wheat
situation can change very drastically from
time to time. A few years ago it was the
conventional wisdom of all the experts that
what producers had to do was produce more
grain, and there would be a market for
everything that could be produced. Now the
conventional wisdom seems to be changing in
the other direction, and all those experts,
whose salaries the federal Government pays,
are now saying that it is a black pitch, that
there really is no hope, and what we must do
is reduce the acreage, reduce production of
one agricultural commodity after another.
The experts were proven wrong a few years
ago, and I expect that in a few years time
what they are now saying will be proven
wrong once again. I therefore hope that the
Government, and others who are considering
the facts of this situation, will bring a little
optimism to bear on prevailing conditions and
try to solve the problem by positive measures
rather than by giving up, by adopting desperate measures of capitulation and saying that
all we can do is to pass around the money
within Canada to pay farmers at a subsistence level not to produce and go out of
production.
Two days ago, the Honourable Otto Lang,
the minister in charge of the Canadian Wheat
Board, announced that a very large sale of
Canadian wheat was being made to the Soviet
Union. There are those who belittle the size
of the sale; there are those who relate it to
over-all production and the inventories of
grain in this country and say that it does not
amount to very much. I think it is a tremendous sale. I think the Minister, the Government and the Wheat Board are to be congratulated on making this sale of some 75
million bushels within the present crop year. I
have checked the figures, which show that
last year we exported to the Soviet Union
1i million bushels of wheat. This year we
will be exporting to the Soviet Union forty
times as much as we exported last year. I
[Hon.

Mr. Argue.]

December 16, 1969

believe we should all agree that the Government has achieved a very important breakthrough in the sale of grain to the Soviet
Union. We should urge the Government to
continue this kind of effort and try to solve
the grain problem by expanding our exports
rather than capitulating to the so-called
experts and say that we will pay the farmers
a few dollars an acre to go out of business
and continue in a state of poverty.
We have now had the Outlook Conference.
I placed a series of questions on the order
paper, and I wish to thank the Leader of the
Government (Hon. Mr. Martin) for the
expeditious manner in which he has sought
out the answers to these questions. I thank
him for his timing. The questions have been
answered today; I have the information in
front of me, and I think it fits very well into
the subject under discussion.
Honourable senators have asked me privately, as have people all across the country:
if there is too much wheat, why do not the
farmers produce less wheat and produce more
of something else? It is a reasonable question
to ask. After the Outlook Conference, where
there were assembled all the ministers of
agriculture from the provincial governments,
experts from the provincial governments
and farm organizations, what is the outlook?
The outlook, according to the experts, is that
we should cut back at least 10 million acres
of our wheat production, that we should cut
the acreage from more than 30 million acres
to 20 million acres. If you tell a practical
farmer to cut back his wheat production he
will say, "Fine, I am willing to do it. I would
like to do it. But what will I produce
instead?" Some experts tell him to produce
oats or coarse grain. What did they say at the
Outlook Conference?
They said that there should be some reduction in oats below the 1969 acreage of 7.9
million towards an annual level of about 6.5
million. So, the experts say: you are producing too much wheat and too much oats. What
about barley? The answer provided is that
an average yield from nine million acres
seeded to barley will be sufficient supply for
1970-71. What they are admitting is that nine
million acres is down about a half million
acres from the amount of barley produced
this year. They are saying there is too much
barley eut.
What do they say about flax and oilseed
crops? They say there will be an acreage
reduction in flax from the 1969 level of 2.4
million acres to a level of 1.5 to two million
acres for each of the next two years.

December 16, 1969

SENATE DEBATES

Too much wheat, too much oats, too much
barley, too much flax! Well, we have not
obtained very much from that experts conference so far.
What about rapeseed? Senators know that
rapeseed has been a very excellent crop in
the northern parts of the Prairies. The market
has been excellent and the return has been
good and farmers feel that this is a kind of a
Cinderella crop. The experts say it would
appear desirable that for 1970 rapeseed acreage be maintained at about 2.2 million acres.
"Just leave it alone, do not increase it."
What do they say about corn acreage? I
have the news release of the Department of
Agriculture in my hand and it says:
We can and will use more Canadian
corn for feed, cutting down on grain
imports for livestock feed this year.
This, coupled with other statements I have
heard, indicates that we can increase corn
acreage but this increase will come in Central
Canada such as in Quebec and Ontario.
I ask honourable senators, no matter from
what part of Canada you come, does it make
any sense at all for an Outlook Conference to
suggest that we increase the production of one
feed grain in one part of Canada when the
farmers in another part have so much feed
grain on hand that these very same experts
are telling them to reduce their acreage?
Would it not have been much more sensible
to say there can be an increased market for
Prairie oats and barley in eastern Canada to
supplement the corn imports coming in from
the United States? If somebody says that corn
is a better feed than oats and barley, I think
it is a debatable point. I would argue that
wheat is still a better feed than corn. We
have lots of wheat and if they are fussy about
oats and barley, we can provide them with
some very high-quality, high-protein wheatthe best wheat in the world. We would be
delighted to sell it for livestock feed in
Ontario and Quebec.
So far I do not think the experts have come
up with anything very encouraging for the
grain producers of this country. The experts
have been wrong before. They went to solve
the dairy situation and they only confounded
it. They have transferred a situation where
there was a surplus of butter to one where
there is a huge surplus of milk powder. I do
not think the situation has been improved at
all. What they are succeeding in doing is to
exterminate, to a very large degree, the
crean production industry on the Prairies
where the farmers today are desperately

short of money and are prepared to go out
and produce butter, because it is now becoming a deficit area. They are exterminating the
production on the Prairies so that we are
going to be importing butter-indeed, we already are. They have not assisted the farmers
to supplement their income in this very difficult time, and steps have to be taken to solve
this situation.
I made a long speech some time ago in
which I urged that the Wheat Board and the
Government should provide an amendment to
the Canadian Wheat Board Act so that the
proper storage of grain on farms could be
brought into the grain system, that the farmers be paid a reasonable amount and that this
asset be protected for our Canadian nation.
I think positive thought should be given to
increasing Canadian markets, and I would
suggest to the Government and to the Minister of Agriculture that there should be a
Canadian conference of authorities called to
deal with the expansion of trade, and specifically with the expansion of markets for Canadian grains and livestock products. At that
conference the kind of suggestion Senator
Pearson made here tonight could be considered, because we have to have increased
production.
When the experts went on to consider
cattle and hogs they made no recommendation for increased cattle production in this
country. The Premier of Saskatchewan has
undertaken a very laudable program. The
provincial legislature has provided for bank
loans at 7 per cent interest for the purchase
of female cattle, with the Government of Saskatchewan subsidizing the interest rate over
and above the 7 per cent. This is an excellent step that has been taken by the Province
of Saskatchewan.
When it comes to hogs they say we might
be able to market an additional one million.
Well, you can produce these hogs from the
grain production of less than a million acres.
When you consider that this is just 10 per
cent of the amount they are recommending
with regard to wheat acreage being reduced,
even this suggestion is very small in relation
to the over-all need.
I was saying that I feel the federal Government should call a conference on export policies in relation to feed grains and wheat
and to see what ideas can be suggested for
increasing our markets. I also suggest that the
Government offer a series of prizes to reputable Canadians to come up with research
papers on how Canada's export grain market

SENATE DEBATES

can be increased. If such a conference and
program were undertaken I think some excellent policies would be forthcoming, and
worthwhile action could result.
In reading about world conditions I note
that food production has gone up all over the
world. It is still a fact that the majority of
people in the world are undernourished and
need our food. It is also true that the vast
majority of people are short of protein, and
if they do not need our grains they need our
meat products. A few years ago a very learned
authority in Canada made the statement that
on this continent we would, at some future
date, have to quit eating meat because the
world required grains to be eaten directly,
a method by which more people could be
fed. The world needs our protein. I would
suggest to honourable senators, to the Leader of the Government in the Senate, to the
Government, and to the farm organizations,
that they should change their thinking, away
from an apparent drive towards a curtailment of acreage and an artificial curtailment
of production, to positive measures to provide markets for Canadian grain.

Thus it is asking Parliament to change the
second name of the Banque Canadienne Nationale as it appears in Schedule A of the
Bank Act, that is, to replace National Canadian Bank by Bank Canadian National so
that the letters B.C.N. will correspond to both
names.
These are the only explanations I have on
this bill which, as I said, is very simple.
I must also add that the Inspector General
of Banks has seen this bill and does not
object to it.
Therefore, if it is adopted on second reading and notwithstanding Rule 45(l)(b), I
intend to ask that the bill, with the unanimous consent of the Senate, be given third

and Communications so that more details can
be obtained by honourable senators if they so
desire.
My onby purpose tonight is ta point out
seven main objectives of the bill, and ini due
course ta move that it be considered in
committee.
First, the bil would authorize capital
expenditures by Canadian National Railways
flot exceeding $201,700,000 during the 1969
calendar year. This level of expenditures compares with $189,400,000 authorized previously
for 1968, excluding the amount required in
that year for investrnent in Air Canada.
I should pause at this point and remind you
that Air Canada is a subsidiary of the
Canadian National Railways.
Hon. Mr. Haig: It is owned by Canadian
National.
Hon. Mr. Laird: Yes.
The bil also contains technical provisions
authorizing Canadian National Railways ta
make expenditures not exceeding $82 million
between January 1 and July 1, 1970, for obligations incurred prior ta, January 1, 1970 and
ta enter into contracts before July 1, 1970, for
capital expenditures not exceeding $113 million for which payment wil not come due
until after 1969.
Second, the bil contains a provision
authorizing Canadian National Railways ta
borrow $19 million for flnancing ail branch
Uine construction. Until recentiy, each specia
statute for construction of a branch line has
included authority for financing its construction, and branch lines nat requiring special
legislation have been financed out of selfgenerated funds. In addition ta covering ail
branch lies, the provision in the resolution
and the bill based upon it are consistent with
the intent of reflecting in the financing and
guarantee bill ahi the financing authorities
which. Canadian National Railways require.
Third, the bill would provide for the continued purchase by the Minister of Finance of
Canadian National Raihways 4 per cent preferred stock through ta the end of the calendar year 1970. This continues the practice of
previaus financing and guarantee acts. The
1968 Financing and Guarantee Act extended
ta December 31, 1969 the expiry date of the
authority granted by Cana dian National Railways Capital Revision Act of 1952 for the
purchase of such stock equivalent ta 3 per
cent of the company's grass revenue.

Fourth, and for the saine reasons, the bill
would extend until the end of 1970 the
moratorium on interest on the governmnent
boan of $100 million to the rallway company
authorized by the Capital Revision Act of
1952.
Fifth, as in previous years, the bill would
provide authority for the Government to
make temporary loans ta Canadian National
Rallways and Air Canada to meet deficiencies
in operating revenues up ta June 30, 1970.
Any such loan is repaid later from revenues
of Canadian National Railways and Air Canada or, if these prove insufficient, the boans
are written off through parliamentary appropriation.
Sixth, the bill contains an option similar ta
that contained in the 1968 Financing and
Guarantee Act which. would enable Air
Canada ta borrow $165 million either directly
from Her Majesty or by means of a guaranteed public issue.
Seventh, the bill would provide for the
appointment of the f=n of Touche, Ross and
Ca. of Toronto and Montreal, chartered accountants, as auditor of Canadian National
Railways for the calendar year 1970.
Finally, I would point out that the present
bili makes no provisions for enlargement of
Canadian National Railways authorîty ta refinance, which at present stands at $680 million
and is considered adequate for the period
covered by the bill.
Those are the main points of the bill,
honourable senators. To assist you in any discussion that may take place here or in coinmittee, perhaps I should point out that I have
read with some degree of care the debate in
the other place and noticed that the principal
issue discussed there was the abandoniment of
certain specific branch lines-whichever ones
were particularly of concern ta the member
speaking.
This debate took place in the middle of
November. I want ta point out something
which is probably well known, that jurisdiction ta permit the abandonmient or discontinuance of branch lines rests with the
Canadian Transport Commission. And in
reading Hansard fromn the House of Commons
I noticed that there seemed ta be a grave
concern that somehow or other those hearings
would not be held because there is actual
power, oddly enough, in the Canadian Transport Commission ta make a decision of this
kind without a hearing. Sa I want ta reassure
you on that point, and perhaps avoid a
problem.

SENATE DEBATES

On December 2 the Chairman of the Canadian Transport Commission, the Honourable
John Pickersgill, speaking to the Canadian
Association of Movers of hearings in connection with the proposal of the railways to discontinue certain branch lines, gave this assurance without equivocation. I quote:
No discontinuance will be approved
without a prior public hearing at some
convenient location in the area involved.
Ample notice of the hearing will be given
and any person or party will be afforded
an opportunity to present views on the
matter.
Hon. Mr. Fournier (Madawaska-Resigouche): Where did you get that statement,
please?

December 16, 1969

The Hon. the Speaker: Order, please. I hope
that the honourable senator is through with
that line of argument. I must assert that we
should be very careful to say nothing that
might reflect on the way debates are conducted in the other house. I trust that the honourable senator will refrain from remarks that
might reflect on the other house.
Hon. Mr. Laird: Thank you very much, Mr.
Speaker. Naturally, I had no thought of
reflecting on the way debate was conducted
in the other house. I was merely trying, if
possible, to avoid the prolongation of this
debate.
My second point which may be helpful to
honourable senators is to draw their attention
to the fact that in the other place two questions were referred for more mature consideration to their Standing Committee on Transport and Communications. Those questions
were, first, the problem of the Canadian National Railways whole financial structure, and,
second, the problem of Canadian National
Railways pensions.
This is a rather brief resumé of the provisions of the bill. I repeat, that so far as details
are concerned it is my intention, if this house
sees fit to give second reading to this bill, to
move to refer it to the Standing Senate Committee on Transport and Communications.

Hon. Mr. Laird: I mentioned a moment ago,
Senator Fournier, that it was from a speech
delivered on December 2 by the Honourable
John Pickersgill, to the Canadian Association
of Movers. I would be very pleased to furnish
you with a copy of the whole speech.
That should be reassuring to those
individuals who have a particular concern
about a branch line being abandoned without
proper notice or proper opportunity for
making suitable representations. So I thought,

SENATE DEBATES

anticipate no difficulty in harvesting the grain
in the spring. I should think that any losses
that might be sustained would be within the
limits of losses sustained in the past, and we
all know that those have been extremely
small.
I compliment Senator Sparrow on his
address to this chamber in introducing the
legislation, and also Senators Aseltine, Pearson, and Argue, all from Saskatchewan, for
the contributions they made to this debate.
They referred not only to the legislation that
Is presently before us in Bill C-157, but also
to many of the problems that confront western Canadian farmers at the present time.
They made suggestions that I think are
worthy of consideration by the Government
of the day; certainly, they are worthy of consideration by our marketing agency, the
Canadian Wheat Board. It is my hope that
due attention will be paid to what was said,
and perhaps some new methods and new
procedures can be introduced that will make
Canadian wheat more competitive and available on the markets of the world.
The problem of the wheat farmer today is
not located, or even centred, in western
Canada. Wheat farmers around the world are
experiencing almost the same problems as we
in Canada are. Our problem is perhaps more
serious in that we have always exported a
greater percentage of our total production
than any country in the world. But the problems today, as I see them, are caused by overproduction of wheat and rice throughout the
greater part of the world.
We all know how farmers in western
Canada have been able to increase the production of wheat. The increase in the production of rice in other parts of the world over
the last few years has been much greater
than the increase we have obtained in the
production of wheat. This means that there
are far more bushels of rice and wheat looking for markets around the world than ever
before in history. This increase in production
has been brought about by the discovery of
new varieties of cereal grains that are more
suited to the areas of the world in which we
have been attempting to produce them. This
increased production was made possible by
better farm practices, better machinery that
is available today, and the more widespread
use of fertilizers and weed sprays.
Only a few years ago, when the Soviet
Union was buying rather large quantities of
wheat from Canada, they began to look into
some of the reasons for their inability to
supply more of their bread wheat from their
[Hon. Mr. McDonald.]

December 17, 1969

home production. Many delegations, consisting of agriculturalists, cereal breeders, engineers, and virtually every other type of
expert from the Soviet Union, visited Canada
and the United States in order to learn the
tricks of the trade in western agriculture.
We were told by our Soviet friends at that
time that the problems they were facing in
the production of wheat were the problems
that western Canada faced back in the thirties. The methods of producing wheat in the
Soviet Union only ten years ago were almost
identical to those used in western Canada 30
or 35 years ago. Western Canada had to find
its way out of its difficulties at that time
through experimentation and research, and it
was a slow process. The Soviet Union does
not have to do this today, because it can come
to our country, and to the great country to
the south of us, and learn our techniques and
methods, and this they have done. I am one
who believes that they will be able to adopt
North American methods to produce far more
wheat grain in the future than in the past. So,
I do not think we can look forward to huge
sales in the Soviet Union over the coming
years.
Like all honourable senators, I welcome the
most recent sale to the Soviet Union. It is not
as large as some sales that we have made in
the past, but any sale of Canadian wheat in
the amount of 75 million bushels, to be delivered during 1970, is very welcome to this
nation, especially to the farmers of western
Canada.
I am not quite as optimistic as some of my
colleagues with respect to the future of cereal
grains for Canada. Part of the reason for that
is the changes which are being made, both
with regard to the varieties and to the farm
practices in other parts of the world. Most of
those changes are taking place in countries
that over the years have been good customers
of Canada for cereal grains.
The Canadian Wheat Board-which is the
sole marketing agency for wheat in Canadaby and large, over their years of experience,
have done a good job for the western Canadian farmer and for Canada as a whole. But I
wonder if the board in its present form can
do as good a job for us in the future as it
has in the past. World conditions have
changed, not only with regard to production
but as to the milling and baking techniques
that are available today.
Most honourable senators have travelled
through various parts of the world and have
had the opportunity of tasting a first-class

Decemnber 17, 1969

SENATE DEBATES

loaf of white bread that has not an ounce of
hard spring red wheat in its making. This has
been brought about by the changes, I repeat,
in the milling and baking techniques that are
available today. I do not believe that the
Canadian Wheat Board, as at present constituted, can be aggressive enough to meet
world competition and to sell wheat in the
quantity in the future that it has in the past.
I was very interested in some of the proposals put forward by my colleagues, Senator
Aseltine, Senator Pearson and Senator Argue.
I believe that we have arrived at the point
where we must put some Canadian salesman
on the road selling Canadian wheat on commission. A hungry salesman will sell a lot
more wheat under competitive conditions
than will a civil servant getting a salary and
a retirement pension paid by the western
farmer. I believe that the time has come for a
change in methods in this Government institution-and I call the Canadian Wheat Board
a Government institution. It is not a farm
organization-to say it is, is utter nonsenseit is a Government institution.
I believe that unless we are prepared to get
out and meet competition with active salesmen, there will be organizations in Canada
prepared to operate in competition with the
Canadian Wheat Board. Al we need do is
look at some of the resolutions recently
passed by farmers' organizations in western
Canada. We live in a new world respecting
grain sales, and we had better adopt new
policies to cope with this new situation. The
Government of the day has made some moves
that have been beneficial to western Canadian
agriculture in recent months, and this bill is
another move that will be helpful to producers in western Canada.
I should like to refer to perhaps half a
dozen moves that have recently been taken,
which have been of benefit to western
Canadian farmers, although they are not the
complete answer to our problems. The answer
to our problems is to dispose in the world
markets of huge quantities of western
Canadian grain, not only wheat but coarse
grains as well. It will be recalled that only a
few weeks ago there was before us a piece of
legislation that made it possible to double the
interest-free cash advances made available to
western Canadian farmers. This was welcome
legislation; it was helpful, but it does nothing
to sell western Canadian grain. We produce
that grain to sell, not to store, and not to take
cash advances on it. However, I repeat that
the legislation was helpful, and was certainly
welcomed by western farmers.

It will also be recalled that not very long
ago improved credit facilities for export were
made available. This too was a very welcome
piece of legislation, and one that will help us
get into some markets of the world that
would be impossible for us to penetrate without increased credit facilities being made
available for this purpose.
Thirdly, it will be recalled that a few
weeks ago we passed legislation setting a
fixed price for wheat sold for human consumption in Canada. The fixed price was not
as high as western Canadian farmers would
like to see, but at least it is a principle for
which the western farmers have been fighting
for years. We have our foot in the door with
a floor price, although it is not as high as we
would like, for the sale for human consumption of wheat in Canada. That is a very welcome legislation, and is a good step forward.
Fourthly, honourable senators will recall
that very recently the Honourable Otto Lang,
the minister responsible for the Canadian
Wheat Board, set up a Canadian Grain
Group. This, of course, will bring together the
Department of Agriculture, the Department
of Industry, Trade and Commerce, the
Department of Transport, and agencies under
these departments. Too often in the past, departments of government have been working
at loggerheads rather than co-operating with
one another to bring about the most efficient
system for sales and transportation of western Canadian grain. I arn sure ail of us welcome this forward step.
In addition, the Task Force on Agriculture
will, I expect, be reporting to this chamber
and to the other place very shortly. It is my
hope that it will have some recommendations
on production, distribution and sales of western Canadian grain.
A sixth move made by the Government of
the day is the establishment of the Canadian
Grains Council, led by the head of the United
Grain Growers. I think they can be instrumental in helping the departments to which I
referred a moment ago solve some of the
problems facing western Canadian agriculture.
I repeat, this problem of surplus wheat is
not one that can be solved by the Parliament
of Canada. It can be solved only if Canadians
and people in other parts of the world come
to realize that we would all be much better
off if we learned to live and let live.
Western Canadians often talk about free
trade. In my opinion western Canada could no
more live with free trade than can any other

SENATE DEBATES
part of Canada; but in western Canada we
can live with a much freer trade than we
have today. I am one of those who believe
that, if we produced those goods and services,
we could openly compete with the world and
exchange them for goods and services which
other people can produce cheaper and perhaps better than we can. Then, all of us,
whether we live in Ontario or Saskatchewan,
will be better off.
The industry of this nation has been protected too long. Certainly, industry had to be
protected in its infancy, but surely after a
hundred years we are not still in our infancy.
We in western Canada by and large sell our
products on the open free markets of the
world, but we are compelled to buy the goods
and services that we require to produce and
to live on a home protective market. Honourable Senators, no man can survive forever under these conditions!
The Government of the day has opened up
some tariff relief recently, at a date much
earlier than it was committed to, and we in
western Canada appreciate that. However, I
say again to you that we in western Canada
believe in much freer trade than we have
today. We also say, let those who can produce
and compete survive, and let those who
cannot produce and compete go by the board
and get into an industry where they can
produce for world markets and buy on world
markets as well.
I was interested yesterday in the remarks
of Senator Argue when, in referring to the
often good advice to western farmers that
they ought to diversify, he pointed out to you
the difficulty: what are we going to diversify
to? Really, there is only one product that
Canadian western farmers could turn to and
increase their production in without creating
surpluses within twelve months, and that is
cattle. The protective capacity of western
Canada today as far as agriculture is concerned is such that, given normal conditions,
we can produce a surplus of anything in the
line of agricultural products that it is possible
to produce in western Canada within twelve
months. That is, with the exception of cattle.
So what are you going to diversify to?

December 17, 1969

is going to produce cattle for at least ten
years as a minimum. If he bas three or four
sections of land and wants to put that land
into grass and go into cattle, how much
money would be involved? Well, I know one
thing: you are talking about more money
than it is possible for any farmer in western
Canada to lay his hands on; and if he paid
the interest rates that are being demanded
and received by the lending institutions today,
he would not have a viable operation anyway
because the profits in livestock, including
cattle, are not great enough for any farmer to
pay anywhere from 9 per cent to 15 per cent,
and sometimes even as high as 18 per cent.
Senator Argue referred to the policy of the
provincial government of Saskatchewan in
making money available to farmers to buy
breeding cattle with an interest ceiling of 7
per cent, with the difference between that
and whatever they will have to pay finally
being subsidized by the provincial government. That is a good program, but it is
limited. If you are going to take all the land
out of wheat that should be taken out to get
production down in line with consumption,
there is not enough money in the provincial
treasury to do the job at any interest rate.
These are some of the problems we are facing.
But, even the Government of the day sometimes creates problems for us. Here we have
the Government of Canada and the Government of Saskatchewan, and virtually every
other government in Canada, telling farmers
that they must take land out of production.
But what are these governments doing at this
very moment? In the Province of Saskatchewan they are cutting down bushland and
bringing it under cultivation. On the one
hand, the Government is advocating taking
land out of production, and on the other hand
it is spending the taxpayers' money in order
to bring new land under cultivation. And that
land, honourable senators, is land that never
should be brought under cultivation in the
first place.
We have some people in our departments of
agriculture and elsewhere who are called soil
specialists. Well, I say to you that not one of
them ever produced a bushel of grain or a

public moneys amounting to perhaps $1 billion. I say "perhaps" because I have no way
of knowing from the bill itself or the explanation given by the Government what the total amount involved may be. Al I can say
positively at this time is that the dollar figures in the bill add up to at least $660 million,
and there are additional provisions committing the public purse to meet future deficiencies of both C.N.R. and Air Canada, so
that the $1 billion figure which I have just
mentioned as the commitment we are asked
to make today is probably close to the mark.
My reason for commenting on the size of
the amount involved is to suggest to honourable senators that the level of financial disclosure that the Government has decided to
give Parliament at the time of introducing
this bill falls far short of what could reasonably be expected to result in an intelligent
and responsible parliamentary decision at
this time.
In saying this I am not criticizing the sponsor of the bill in this chamber. Senator Laird
has given as full an explanation as the Government in its wisdom or oLherwise has
decided to allow us to have. Indeed be went
somewhat further than his speech sponsoring
the bill last night, and additionally be has

I am certainly not going to assert that I

competence in reading a balance sheet or
financial statement, but any such competence
is quite useless, to me at least, in attempting
to understand what this bill is all about. I
repeat, from the wording of the bill itself and
from any explanation given by the Government, it is certainly net readily understandable. Perhaps the best I can do at this particular time is to indicate some of the areas
of nondisclosure in which it seems to me that
much more information should be given to
any legislative body at the time it is being
asked to commit the public purse to amounts
as large as these.
I am net permitted to refer in detail to the
legislative course of this bill, but within the
rule, I think I can say that perhaps more
information would have been available to us
at this time if this bill had gone to the appropriate standing committee in the other place.
It did not go to that committee but had a
short run in Committee of the Whole. Now it
comes to us, and I am pleased that the sponsor of the bill has said that it is his intention
[Hon. Mr. Grosart.]

December 17, 1969

to refer it to our own appropriate standing
committee, so that at least it will have its first
examination by a standing committee before
being passed.
It is truc that during the course of the
legislative process of this bill so far, the Government apparently had a change of mindperhaps not an entirely voluntary oneand referred the subject matter or part of
the subject matter of the bill to the appropriate standing committee of the other place.
That does not, of course, alter the fact that it
was given third reading and passed in the
other place without going to a standing
commitee.
The usual excuse given for the low level of
disclosure of information in a bill such as this
is that this is "the usual C.N.R. financing
bill." Honourable senators, I suggest that it is
not the usual C.N.R. financing bill-it is a
most unusual bill in many respects.
I have already indicated the history of this
bill. As I said, it comes to us without having
been examined by a standing committee of
the other place. I have also pointed out that
that was the original decision of the Government, and it was only a later decision to refer
part of the subject matter to a standing conmittee. This again was, I suggest, inv ountary,
for the reason-and I think I am allowed to
speculate on this-that the Government had
some concern as to whether the bill would
pass. So they found it necessary to come to
the kind of arrangement which was made. I
say that because the opposition to the passing
of this bill without further information being
given, is mounting all across the country. The
demand for an explanation of Government
intentions in the matter of Canadian transportation policy has reached the point where I
fail to see how the Government can continue
on its present course of burying its head in
the sand about the gigantic transportation
problems that face Canada today. I will indicate some of the matters which constitute the
type of proof that exists for that statement.
This month the Air Transport Association
of Canada went to the extreme length of
passing a non-confidence motion in the Air
Transportation Committee of the Canadian
Transport Commission. This is an action
which surcly should wake up this Government, if it bas not already been awakened
from its long sleep in this matter by other
actions taken by similar associations.
The second aspect in which this bill is
unusual is in the amount of money to which
we are asked to commit the public purse. If
this bill becomes law, the C.N.R. long-term

December 17, 1969

SENATE DEBATES

debt, if my arithmetic is correct, will go over
the $2 billion mark for the first time in history. So, in passing this bill we are giving
assent to the C.N.R. long-term debt going to
more than $2 billion.
In saying that, I am not directing any criticism at the present management of the C.N.R.
The fact of the matter is that in the last 25
years the operating record of the C.N.R. management has been very good. Honourable
senators will be glad to know, for example,
that in 21 of the last 24 years the C.N.R. bas
shown an operating profit. For the present
year the annual statement shows a railway
operating profit of $18.7 million and other
operating profit-hotels, the telecommunications system, etc.-of $22.5 million, for a total
of $41.2 million. Yet much of this bill is about
how to look after the C.N.R. deficit. The deficit is created by the fact that the interest bill
of the C.N.R. this year is $70 million, bringing
about a deficit of $29.2 million. Yet, in presenting this bill we heard no word from the
Government as to whether it has any ideas on
relieving the C.N.R. of this largely artificial
burden. As honourable senators are aware,
the substantive part of this debt was created
a long time ago to solve what was really a
political problem when the C.N.R. was created to take over some 78 railway lines, most
of which were bankrupt.
Honourable senators, in the last 25 years
the C.N.R. has paid interest on a debt which
can only be expressed in ten figures-$1,241,000,000-on a total debt which is today $2
billion. Of course, it has not been at that level
throughout the years, but it is an indication
of the intolerable burden that is placed on
this railway and the almost absurd intricacy
of the wording of the bill now before us. It is
a hodge-podge of attempts to solve problems
over the years in which one paragraph is
added to another. For example, in a bill
which provides for $19 million of funding of
new branch lines we find it is broken up and
referred to in three different subsections. I
defy anyone who bas not intimate knowledge
of this to explain to me why it has to appear
in three different places.
On that particular point, it is impossible for
me to understand why the Government would
come before Parliament and say, "We want to
authorize $19 million in new branch Unes in
Canada," without even offering to tell Parliament what these branch lines are. The reply
may be that the information is available. It is
available in the document known as the Capital Budget of the C.N.R. However, that is
presented by the Minister of Transport to the
21498-231

Cabinet and is passed by Cabinet, not by
Parliament. The only copy of that document I
have ever seen is marked "Confidential," and
I do not even know whether I am entitled to
refer to it. It would seem that any government which was truly anxious to inform Parliament as to what it was doing in passing a
bill like this would at least say, "We are asking for $19 million, the purpose of which is
to build the following lines. . .". Perhaps the

Government might have been embarrassed in.
saying that.
Hon. Mr. Bourget: Is not a special bill
introduced when a new line is to be built by
the C.N.R.? I believe that procedure has been
followed in the past. Whenever a new Une is
to be constructed, a bill containing all the
information is introduced. They even set out
the average cost per mile of the new line.
Hon. Mr. Grosart: I am grateful to Senator
Bourget for his interjection. Although I am
speaking from memory now, I think that if he
will inquire further into the matter he will
find that is no longer the case, because this
bill provides blanket authorization, and the
very protection that he bas so wisely brought
to our attention is apparently now being
abandoned. This is the kind of thing I am,
talking about, and I am glad that Senator
Bourget raised the question.
Hon. Mr. Bourget: This was the case up
until last year when we considered a similar
bill for a new line.
Hon. Mr. Martin:
abandonments.

He is talking about

Hon. Mr. Grosari: No. With due respect to
the sotto voce interjection of the Leader of
the Government that "He is talking about
abandoned lines," if the reference is to me, I
can assure him that I am not speaking about
abandoned lines, but about new branch lines.
Again, I am speaking from memory and I
do not pretend to be an expert on this, but if
my information is correct I say to him that
this is one of the unusual features of this
so-called "usual" bill. Whether it is as a result
of the bill or ancilliary to it, I am informed
that in future there will be no more private
bills seeking the authorization of Parliament
to fund a new line. I trust I am correct in
that; in any event, we can get the information
when the bill goes to committee. Again, I say
I am speaking from memory and I make
no pretence at being an expert in this field.
I have said that this bill is unusual in
several ways. Another is in the area to which;

SENATE DEBATES
the Leader of the Government has just
referred, when he spoke of abandoned lines.
This bill comes before us at a time when both
the C.N.R. and the C.P.R. have before the
Canadian Transport Commission applications
to abandon 31 railway lines. There is some
suggestion that the discussion of the abandonment of railway lines is not in order in considering this bill. Unless His Honour rules
otherwise-and I do not intend to take a great
deal of time on it-I suggest there are very
few subjects that are more relevant to this
bill. In my view, a bill which asks for $19
million to build new railway lines certainly is
one regarding which it would be quite proper
to discuss the abandonment of railway lines.
Hon. Mr. Martin: In any event, they cannot
do it without the approval of the commission.
Hon. Mr. Grosari: I do not know to what
extent the honourable Leader of the Government considers that remark relevant, because
I was not discussing how they would do it; I
was mercly saying that they have applications before the Canadian Transport Commission. Perhaps the honourable the Leader of
the Government thought it should be emphasized. I mentioned that the applications were
before the Canadian Transport Commission,
and I think that is irrelevant.
The fact is that the railways are asking
permission to abandon these lines, and I am
not suggesting that they should not. I am not
a railway expert, but it is rather interesting
to recall that in 1967 Parliament passed a bill
called the Canadian Transportation Act which
provided, among other things, that if the railways wished or desired to abandon a line
which they could prove was not paying but
which the Transportation Commission regarded as essential for one reason or another, the
railways could apply for, and would in fact
get, a subsidy of 80 per cent.
As we are now considering a transportation
bill, I think we should be concerned whether
this wholesale application to abandon lines is
somehow related to the opportunity that the
railways might have, in the event of a refusal, to apply for a subsidy of 80 per cent. It
may well be that this particular section of the
National Transportation Act is not working
out in quite the way its sponsors thought it
would.
Another respect in which this is an unusual
bill is that it provides-although the figures
are not mentioned here-for the Minister of
Finance to buy C.N.R. 4 per cent preferred
bonds. I point out that there is no specific
[Hon. Mr. Grosart.]

December 17, 1969

mention of these bonds in the bill, but if
honourable senators read the fine print in
some other document they will understand
that that is what is referred to. Of course this
has to be unusual when the cost of money to
the Government is what it is today.
I think we should have been told that we
are facing a situation in which the Government-and I am not prepared to say whether
or not it is acting wisely in this respect-is
undertaking to buy the 4 per cent preferred
bonds of the Canadian National. We should
have been told the rate of interest the Government is paying on the money it is using. I
am not saying that there is any other way, but I
am speaking of disclosure. It would seem to
me that when we are asked to agree to this
we should, first of all, be told specifically
about the 4 per cent bonds, and what the cost

is.

Another aspect in which the bill is unusual
is that it comes to us at a time when the
C.P.R. has appealed to the Supremre Court of
Canada to reverse a ruling by the Canadian
Transport Commission with respect to the
costing formula they use when they apply for
the abandonment of lines. This is sub judice
at the moment, and I make no further comment upon it.
I have already mentioned the climate prevailing when this bill is introduced. There is
the extraordinary resolution of the Air Transport Association of Canada, which appears in
even stronger form in its 1968 annual report,
where it says that the whole transport situation is in a most difficult position because of
the "confusion of Government policy."
Honourable senators, I should like to say
something about the amounts of money
involved. I shall not go seriatim through the
bill, because this information is fairly widely
scattered, but if honourable senators are
interested in following me through one clause
I will refer first to clause 3, headed "Capital
Expense". Paragraph (a) of subclause 1
authorizes the National System-that is, the
C.N.R., and its now 30-odd subsidiaries-"to
make capital expenditures not exceeding in
the aggregate $201,700,000 in the calendar
year 1969 in the following estimates
amounts.

. ."

In

other words, we are being

asked today, December 17, to authorize a
capital investment of over $201 million in the
calendar year 1969. Does this mean that in the
next thirteen days $201 million is going to be
spent, if we pass this bill, or does it mean
that the money has already been spent? I
suspect the latter, and I suggest that if this is
so, then Parliament should have been told so

December 17, 1969

SENATE DEBATES

by the minister. I am not criticizing Senator
Laird, because what the minister does not
disclose his sponsor in the Senate could
hardly be expected to know about.
In paragraph (b) of clause 3(1) we are asked
to authorize the National System to make
capital expenditures not exceeding $82 million, $2 million of which is for branch lines,
in the calendar year 1970, for the purpose of
discharging obligations that were incurred by
the National Company prior to 1970, and have
become due and payable for that day, namely,
July 1 of next year. I suggest that we are
asked to authorize money to discharge obligations that were incurred-it is in the past
tense-and that have become due and payable-again, it is in the past tense. The bill
does not say the money has been spent. The
Government has not told us whether it has
been spent. Surely, that is something that
should have been put before Parliament.
Clause 3(l)(c) deals with an item of $113
million, and it authorizes the C.N.R. to enter
into contracts and so on, and then we have
the phrase "for general additions and conversions that will come in course of payment
after the calendar year 1969". I may not be
very clever about such things, but if any
honourable senator can tell me what the
phrase "will come in course of payment"
means, then I will thank him. I have not the
faintest idea of what it means.
There is authorization here for the borrowing of money for the branch lines, and, as I
have said, it appears in three places. I would
be interested in knowing why. I would be
interested in knowing what branch lines we
are dealing with, because I presume that they
have now been built. As Senator Bourget has
said, separate measures concerning those
branch lines probably have been before us,
but this bill does not indicate whether they are
already built. It seems strange to me that we
should now be asked to authorize this money
if it has already been authorized, as Senator
Bourget suggested. Perhaps double authorization is now needed for Government spending.
In fact, it might be a good idea.
I have mentioned the debt of $2 billion of
the C.N.R. It would be very difficult for
anyone who bas had as short a course as I
have in these matters to say whether it would
make sense now to forgive that whole debt,
but I do suggest that there should be in the
very immediate future a statement of Government policy in respect to it. The railway
has asked for it over the years, and the Government remains, as far as I know, silent. The

Government certainly is silent as far as con-

cerns any information it might have given us
at this time.
Hon. Mr. Martin: The question, of course,
has been asked every year. It was asked
between 1957 and 1958. It is not a new
question.
Hon. Mr. Grosari: That is the most amazing
defence I have ever heard of a government
policyHon. Mr. Martin: It is clarification.
Hon. Mr. Grosari: -that I should not ask
the question now because it has been asked
for years.

Hon. Mr. Martin: No, no.
Hon. Mr. Grosari: Well, that is the import
of the Government Leader's statement. He
said that it is not a new question, that it bas
been asked for years. I agree. But is that any
reason for his intervention that I should not
now ask the question?
Hon. Mr. Martin: Of course not.
Hon. Mr. Grosari: Then perhaps the Government Leader will privately indicate to me
what the purpose of the intervention was.
Hon. Mr. Martin: I should be very glad to
do that.
Hon. Mr. Grosari: Finally, honourable senators, this bill deals also with Air Canada. We
still have this strangely anomalous position
whereby the financing of Air Canada goes
through the C.N.R. There are some indications in statements that have been made,
directly connected with this bill, that Air
Canada is now to be freed from the monetary
umbrella of the C.N.R. I would hope that in
due course we might have a statement of
policy on that, and also on whether it is the
intention of the Government to separate Air
Canada completely from its association with
the C.N.R. and permit it to operate perhaps as
a private company.
Air Canada is making money. Not since a
very few years from its inception has Air
Canada lost any money, and in the view of
some who are quite competent to judge these
things the time has come for Air Canada to
become a public corporation, in the sense of
equity participation by the public.
There are many other things that might be
said about this bill, but I make one final
reference along the lines of my opening

SENATE DEBATES

other ways, establish some kind of a committee, some kind of rationale, a tribunal, or
even an ombudsman, so that if disputes arise
between contractors and the C.N.R., or
between contractors and the Department of
Public Works, neither the Government, the
C.N.R. nor the contractors should be required
to go to the expense of hauling their opposite
number into court to endeavour to have the
courts settle the dispute in question. I would
think that this is the kind of suggestion that
the Government should be considering, and
that the Senate at some time might wish to
make a recommendation upon. It would seem
to me that when the C.N.R. and its directors
get involved in a dispute involving substantial sums of money, the courts are not suited
to have this kind of dispute settled but there
should be a tribunal set up for this practice.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: What difference would it
make?

Hon. Mr. Argue: The C.N.R. contracts stand
out by themselves as being among the most
onerous and one-sided contracts in existence
in Canada.
Hon. Mr. Bourget: I had some experience in
the Department of Public Works, and from
that experience I may say that they are all
the same. I agree with what the honourable
senator said, that the engineer in chief, the
resident engineer, can do whatever he likes.
He can crucify, if I may use the word, any
contractor. Even if they were to set up a kind
of ombudsman, that would not help the case. I
am not a lawyer, but I imagine that even if
he gave a decision the matter would still go
before the courts. I am not a lawyer and I
may be wrong, but even if you set up an
ombudsman, the matter could go back to the
court. You have got to change the specifications.

Hon. Mr. Argue: My honourable friend can
correct me if the facts are not as I state them.
But, having sat in as an observer at many
sessions of this committee, my understanding
is that the Department of Public Works and
the Government have recently taken steps to
amend their contracts, that the people who
are doing this kind of work consider their
contracts preferable to those of the C.N.R.,
and that the C.N.R. has not moved in this
direction.
If, on further research, my honourable
friend finds I am in error, then I will be

closed those loopholes. That is why I say that
the departmental engineers can do anything
they want. They can crucify any contractor
on anything.
Hon. Mr. Argue: As far as this particular
situation is concerned, they have recommended that the Minister of Transport establish a
one-man inquiry to consider the merits of the
claims and no doubt to make a recommendation to the Government.
I would think that if the Government and
the contractors involved were able to get a
very outstanding Canadian to perform this
duty, he might continue in this work, to have
referred to him disputes which might arise.
Perhaps the commissioner himself might not
have the full authority to settle, but have
authority to make recommendations to the
Government and to the contractors themselves that would lead to an amicable
settlement.
As one senator who has taken a good deal
of in'erest in this question, I am pleased with
the work which has been donc in the Senate.
And I am most pleased with the work which
has been done in the House of Commons. I
have seen on a number of occasions recently
the Honourable Don Jamieson, Minister of
Transport, in action. I have great admiration
for the attitude he has taken. I think he is a
fair and honourable man, and I think he is
tough, tough enough to deal with the C.N.R.
and to deal with a dispute such as this in a
way that will bring justice and equity.
Hon. Edgar Fournier: Honourable sena t ors,
I rise to put a question to the Leader of the
Government. Due to the fact that I cannot
obtain an answer to my notice of inquiry of
December 4, and the Canadian National Railway in'ends to take the Ocean Limited out of
service in the Saint John River valley, what
is commonly known as the Transcontinental
line, on January 7, and transfer it to the
intercontinental route, will the Leader of the
Government in the Senate ask the Government to declare this a disaster area. It is not
only a disaster, it is a catastrophe. You can
believe me in that.
I have been trying to find out what has
happened through my notice of inquiry, but I
have been unable to get an answer. However,
I know quite a bit about it. I think I have
found my answer from other sources. I have
been calling around trying to get the facts,
and possibly later I will make a serious accusation with respect to the Canadian National.
We are not asking the Canadian National to
remove any train service at all. The Canadian
[Hon. Mr. Bourget.]

December 17. 1969

National has two lines running through the
Province of New Brunswick, one on the north
shore and the other through the centre of the
province-the northshore line and the central
line. Three trains run daily over the north
shore line serving Moncton, Campbellton,
Rivière du Loup and then through Joffre or
Charny, and the names of the trains are
Chaleur, the Scotian, and the Ocean Limited.
What used to be called the Maritime Express,
now called the Local, operates from Moncton.
Why they operate four trains over one line
and none in the centre part of the province
has never been explained. For many years
the railway has made various excuses for not
running a train through the centre of the
province. Apparently great pressure has been
put on the railway for a service starting in
Fredericton, the capital of New Brunswick,
and running through Moncton, McGivney,
Woodstock, Grand Falls, Edmundston, Blue
River, St. Elucher, and Monks. I am just
naming the main stations. The railways have
given all kinds of excuses. First they said the
line had no rock ballast. Well, now it is a
rock ballast line. Then they claimed that
there were too many curves for passenger
service. Now they haul between 125 and 135
freight cars over those same rails. Cbviously
the curves do not present a problem. Furthermore, this same line now has a great safety
system called C.T.C., which would be an
advantage for passenger service.
Finally, in centennial year, the Canadian
National Railways said they would make an
attempt to give us a train, and since then the
train has been very successful. It has been
running most of the time to full capacity. It is
supposed to be an 18-car train, but during the
summer months it has been necessary for
them to put on 22 cars in order to accommodate all passengers. We know the figures from
various sources, including local agents, and I
am confident that this has been one of the
best paying trains in the system. However,
the railway now tells us that it is going to
remove from the north shore line the
Chaleur, which has given service from the
Gaspe coast to Rivière du Loup, and on up to
Montreal. I can understand that that train
does not pay because they have too many
passenger trains for the region. But ours, I am
sure, does pay and yet the railway is going to
take it away and give it to the north shore to
replace the Chaleur. It is beyond me why
they are contemplating such a move. I find it
terribly confusing.
Last night in his speech Senator Laird put
on record certain remarks made by the

December 17, 1969

SENATE DEBATES

Honourable John Pickersgill, Chairman of the
Board of Transport Commissioners. I have
with me part of a news release dated December 2 dealing with a speech by Mr. Pickersgill, and I should like to read certain parts of
it which refer to the removal or discontinuance of certain passenger services. The news
release has this to say:
Mr. Pickersgill said federal law places
on the CTC the responsibility for deciding whether a particular service is not
required in the public interest, and therefore should be discontinued, or whether
the public need requires that it be kept
in operation with compensation for losses.
'These decisions are not going to be
made lightly,-'
That is the point; they are not going to be
made lightly.
'These decisions are not going to be
made lightly, nor will they be made
within the confines of our office building,'
he told the luncheon audience.
'No discontinuance will be approved
without a prior public hearing at some
convenient location in the area involved.
Ample notice of the hearing will be given
and any person or interested party will
be afforded an opportunity to present
views on the matter.''There are some obvious cases where
passenger-train service is going to have
to be continued because no other alternative mode of transportation is available
in the area,' Mr. Pickersgill said.
This is indeed an obvious case.
Now, this is a statement which I was
pleased to see, but it is not in accordance
with the recommendation of the C.N.R. with
respect to the schedule in which they say
they are prepared to take this train off service on January 7.
Incidentally, regarding all the places I mentioned a moment ago, the chambers of commerce and other organizations have put tremendous pressure on the railway lines to
keep the service in that area, because otherwise there are no facilities for transportation,
as you can see from the news release itself.
There are no airport facilities in my locality,
nor in the City of Edmundston. The nearest
airport to Edmundston is Quebec city which
is 210 miles to the west, or Fredericton, which
is 176 miles to the east. There is no train
service; all we have is a bus service. So ours
is surely an area where there are no other
facilities.
21498-24

At this time I should like to read a telegram dated November 13, signed by J. W. G.
MacDougall, Vice-President of Canadian
National Railways, and addressed to the
mayor of Edmundston. This telegram is not in
accordance with what Mr. Pickersgill is purported to have said, as I read a minute ago.
Mr. MacDougall is answering the Chamber of
Commerce in Edmundston, and says:
This decision was only taken after very
careful consideration and in accordance
with the direction of the Canadian Transport Commission to reduce service in
those areas where the demand is not consistent with the service offered.
I will come to this later.
This debate has been going on in the other
place for two months, and when this news
first came out in my area the public in general were of the opinion that it was a recommendation of the Government. Naturally our members in the House of Commons
and other people did not agree with the
recommendation, and it was acknowledged
that it was not a decision of the Government.
I personally am sure it was not a decision of
the Government. I am also sure that it was
not a decision of the Transport Commissioner,
because it is obvious from the recommendation I just read a moment ago by Mr. Pickersgill that there will be no curtailment of passenger service unless there is a public hearing.
My question then is: who took the decision?
Possibly it was the same people who do not
want to release the figures which we have
been trying to get-and I am not the only one
trying to get them. Perhaps we are causing
some embarrassment to somebody.
Let me read further from that telegram:
Our statistics of carryings support this
view.
Honourable senators, Mr. MacDougall is
talking here about the removal of the train
and he says, "Our statistics of carryings support this view". So the railways must have
the statistics. I am sure they have them on
record, otherwise they are very poor administrators indeed. Those records are made up
from dail y figures which are compiled each
week, each month and then, finally, annually,
and there is an annual report. It is unbelievable and not at all acceptable that the railway
people do not have the figures I want. There
should be no such delay in getting them.
There must be some other cause. I hope that
the Leader of the Government will take
notice of my demands so that before the end

SENATE DEBATES
of the year we might not be living in a deserted area apart from the rest of Canada.
Believe me, if the railway is removed, we will
be living in a deserted area.
As I said before, our railway could be a
paying proposition if operated efficiently. Perhaps it does not pay every day, because naturally there are days when there is no crowd;
on the other hand, there are days when there
is need to add cars in order to carry all the
people.
It is very interesting to compare the passenger service of the Canadian National Railways with that of Air Canada, which is
operated by the same company. The train
service is far below the standard of the air
line service. It is like comparing night with
day. It is almost unbelievable that they are
part of the same company.
As honourable senators may know, I spend
about three days every week travelling on
Canadian National trains. I have been doing
that for the last eight years. It takes me a day
and a half to go home and a day and a half to
come back. I take a sleeper on the way down,
and a sleeper on the way up. I have occasion
to talk to many people and I know what the
service is. I know there is tremendous dissatisfaction among the employees. It is frightening. About ten years ago an effort was
made to increase the passenger services and
these efforts were very successful. A gentleman in Montreal, a Mr. Delagrave, introduced
the coloured tickets which were very successful. Since that time, because of the difficulties
of highway travel with so many accidents,
people have been going back to the railroad
and still more people will go back provided
we give them the service. The occasional
train delay is not important. I have been on
trains when they were delayed in wintertime
for two or three hours because of weather
conditions, and people have not been annoyed
about it because they understand the situation. They understand the difficulties facing
the railroads in impossible weather. It may
have been that one or two were dissatisfied but
the vast majority had no complaints. As I say,
honourable senators, people want to go back
to the railways. They have been going back,
with the result that over the last five or six
years there has been an increase of 6 to 8 per
cent each year, and in Centennial year I
believe there was an increase of 18 per cent.
Naturally, one cannot reasonably expect a
tremendous increase over the figures for Centennial year because that was a special occasion.
[Hon. Mr. Fournier (Madawaska-Restigouche).]

December 17, 1969

Honourable senators, there is tremendous
dissatisfaction over the whole system. Yet we
hear about the tremendous amount of money

that the railways are losing, and so on. There
are some remarks which I have made on previous occasions which I am going to make
again now. I believe the head offices are
overloaded, and this in itself costs a great
deal of money. Among the employees there
is a tremendous amount of bad feeling; they
are very nervous because they are being
watched so carefully that they cannot even
turn around. In the last few years the C.N.R.
has hired a large number of what they call
efficiency experts. Yesterday evening we
heard from Senator Argue what efficiency
experts have done in agriculture in the west,
and I believe some of these experts are doing
the same thing for the railroads. So far as I
am concerned, these are people for whom
jobs have been created and they have in fact
become snoopers. They walk around the railroad yards, and they travel in the trains.
You find them in the diners, in the sleepers,
and everywhere else. This is the situation
right across the country. Conditions are so
bad that they are really affecting the morale
of the employces, and this is a very serious
situation. I could tell you many things that
would make you laugh, things that are happening every day. Those people are not happy
in their work, and if you are not happy in
your work you are not producing; you are
nervous and under tension all the time. On
the railways the employees cannot turn
around because of these snoopers. I shall tell
you more about snoopers very shortly.
Now, honourable senators, I am going to
change the subject because I do not want to
take too much time. Before doing so might I
suggest that it would be a good thing for a
Senate committee to investigate the operations of the railways. Personally, I believe it
would be one of the best things the Senate
could do, and it would result in the saving of
many thousands of tax dollars to the Canadian taxpayer. You would be amazed and
alarmed at some of the things that are going
on.
Honourable senators, recently you may have
noticed some now signs in Canadian National
stations. These are beautiful metal structures
with two glass panels with a picture in the
middle showing a nice big red apple. These
signs must cost at least $30 each. Right across
the top of the sign it says, "Try our low fares;
they are delicious." Incidentally, I imagine
these signs are charged against the passenger
service and not against freight service. On
Monday last, after seeing one of these signs

December 17, 1969

SENATE DEBATES

Coming back to what I was saying about
the signs, "Try our low fares; they are delicious," in my view they are an indication that
people are not working together. The man who
authorized the expenditure of maybe hundreds of thousands of dollars on these signs
should make sure that trains will be available
before authorizing the signs. You go to the
station and there is the sign, and then you go
to the man who sells the tickets and he tells
you that there is no space. This is an
unbelievable situation. So, I sent this telegram
to Mr. MacMillan, the President of the
C.N.R.:

which had been there for two weeks, I went
to the wicket to make a reservation to travel
to Edmundston on Saturday next, a matter
of 7 days later. I asked for a ticket and I
was told there was no sleeper space. So I
asked for a seat in a coach and I was told
there was no space in a coach.
So, what can you do? It is not the fault of
the man at the wicket that there is no space
available. And still, honourable senators, you
walk around and you see these fine new signs.
But when you try to avail of these new low
fares which are so delicious, you cannot find
the space available. And this is the situation
during Christmas week when they know
many Canadians will be travelling-they
have no space available. Just imagine the loss
of revenue that will follow from this unfortunate situation.

one is a pass and usually there are regulations on the back of it which we have to
observe. This one is unlimited and gives blanket use. On leaving Edmundston the fellow
takes a piece of paper, puts it in a computer
and-click, click!-he gets through to Montreal and in a few minutes Montreal replies
that there is no space on the train. When the
train comes in I go to the conductor and say,
"Have you any space left?" He replies, "Come
right in." I board the train and find there are
20 or 25 unoccupied seats. This has happened
dozens of times. The agent turns me down
because he says there are no seats available
according to the computer, and yet, on boarding the train, I find thatHon. M. Aseltine: It is half empty.
Hon.

Mr.

Fournier

(Madawaska-Resti-

gouche): Well, that is a slight exaggeration,
but there are dozens of empty seats. People are most unhappy about this situation.
Travelling this way I have no problems but it
is not pleasant. But when I travel east from
Montreal to my home it is a different matter.
The ticket collector is not interested in my
pass. He wants to know whether I have a
coach seat, a sleeper or roomette ticket. This
pass does not mean anything to him at all; be
wants to see my reservation, and if I have no
reservation I cannot go through. Yet here is a
senator who is authorized by law to take any
train at any time in Canada, and he cannot
get on. Where do we stand on that? Maybe
you do not have that problem, but I have.
I had an argument with a ticket collector a
week or two ago. I have been going to the
same gate twice a week for eight years and
the same fellow has been on that gate for five
or six years. Every time I arrive at the gate
with my luggage, I put my luggage down,
open by wallet and show him the ticket, the
pass and the reservation. Recently I asked
him, "Don't you know me after all these
years?" He replied, "I have to do my job
because if I do not somebody else will." I
thanked him and told him I appreciated his
honesty. And he is right, he has to do that
because there are snoopers watching him
very carefully, seeing whether he collects
every ticket and checks every one in order to
avoid an error. I can see that be must do that
because it is very difficult to control the
movement of people. All you have to do is
stand and watch them and, despite all the
security and the watching you do, there are
still a few who get on the wrong train. It

and regulations when a man has known my

face for eight years, knows I have a ticket or
a pass, and he and I know where I am going,
but I still have to go through all this.
On Saturday I want to go home by train,
and I am going to. If you look at the timetable you will find that if you have to travel a
distance of over 250 miles you need one of
these reservations. So I go to this poor young
fellow shaking in his boots because of the
number of snoopers around. I say that I am
going to Drummondville, and I enter the
train. When we reach Drummondville I put
my coat on and take my luggage and disembark on the platform, and re-embark immediately for Joffre. I do the same thing at
Joffre and Monk, and finally reach home. But
is it not a joke, that a man who is entitled to
free transportation has to play this sort of
game? I have become a snooper. The C.N.R.
has trained me to become a snooper! Sometimes it is unbelievable.
This is all I have to say. In fact, I could say
more, but I hope the officials of the C.N.R. are
listening to my remarks and that they will
convey them to the right quarter, because I
really mean what I say. I am not very happy
about the service.
I do not see why this situation should arise.
They made a good start with passenger service; the trains are pretty good, the food is
good. They are spending thousands of dollars
on television, newspaper and radio advertising and in the distribution of pamphlets to
encourage people to go by train. You see pictures of passengers relaxing in their coach
chairs, and you are being exhorted to leave
your car at home. Then you go to the wicket
at the station to buy a ticket and the clerk
says, "Sorry, there are no seats."
Hon. Keith Laird: Honourable senatorsThe Hon. the Speaker: I must inform

Senator Laird speaks now his speech will

Hon. Mr. Laird: Honourable senators, I certainly have every sympathy for Senator Fournier with regard to his personal problems. I
readily sympathize with him in his complaints, specifically with regard to the possible abandonment of service. I trust that he

proper time, before the Canadian Transport
Commission, as be himself indicated, by using
the quotation I used last night, to show that
the Honourable John Pickersgill has made it

Decernber 17, 1969

SENATE DEBATES

very plain that every single application for
abandonment or discontinuance of service will
be subject to scrutiny, after hearing any interested parties.
Senator Grosart pointed out that many of
the questions he raised can be considered in
committee. I agree with this, and therefore
my replies will be very brief.
I take it that Senator Grosart considers that
the overall transportation policy should be
examined, but I would draw to the attention
of this house the fact that the Department of
Transport, under the direction of the Honourable Donald Jamieson, is presently engaged
in a very intensive and overall study of all
forms of transport-not only the railways, but
the air lines, buses, water transportation, and
any other form of transportation. This was
publicized plainly in an article in the Globe
and Mail on September 26 last. It is a long
article and, of course, I have no intention of
reading it into the record. However, an overau study of transportation problems in
Canada is being made at the present time.
In respect of non-disclosure of amounts, I
would draw Senator Grosart's attention to the
fact that the bill does actually give amounts,
although I will admit that the details will
have to be brought out before the committee,
which is a much more suitable forum for the
discussion of such matters.
As an example, in that connection I should
like to mention new branches. It is true that
in the statement I made last night I gave no
details of proposed new branch lines. It is my
view that such details should be given in
committee, but I will say that there are five
new branch lines proposed, and each one of
them is in an area where there is mineral or
oil production. I am advised that branch lines
which are over 20 miles in length must, under
the National Transportation Act, receive parliamentary
approval, but
parliamentary
approval is not needed for branch lines of less
than 20 miles. Of the five branch lines I mentioned, three were over 20 miles in length,
and were, in fact, approved by Parliament. In
any event, more details can be obtained in
committee.
Senator Grosart mentioned the amount of
$200,700,000. I understand that up to this
point the expenditures have been confined to
self-generated income or, in other words, to
what has been earned by Canadian National
Railways. I admit that I am not in a position
to say categorically one way or the other that
the expenditures have all been made, but

here again the committee will have the benefit of the attendance not only of officials of
the Department of Finance but, and what is
more important, of top ranking officials of
Canadian National Railways and Air Canada.
I suggest that any further details in that connection can be elicited from them.
So far as Air Canada itself is concerned, as
Senator Grosart suggested, there may be a
possible change in setup. I think he is probably right. Of course, this is a matter for Government policy. It is under consideration, and
naturally I can say nothing about it. It is to
be presumed that in due course there will be
an announcement of Governiment policy in
respect of that matter.
Honourable senators, having in mind that
top ranking officials of the C.N.R. and Air
Canada, as well as others from the Department of Finance, will attend before the committee, I commend this bill for second reading. If it is given second reading, I will move
that it be referred to the committee.
Motion agreed to, and bill read second time.
REFERRED TO COMMITTEE

On motion of Hon. Mr. Laird, bill referred
to the Senate Standing Committee on Transport and Communications.
EXCISE TAX ACT
BILL TO AMEND-SECOND

READING

Hon. Eric Cook moved the second reading
of Bill C-155, to amend the Excise Tax Act.
He said: Honourable senators, Bill C-155, to
amend the Excise Tax Act, owes its birth to
the Government's policy announced by the
Minister of Finance in his budget speech of
June 3. The budget speech pointed out that
the general policy is to require those who use
and benefit directly from services and facilities provided by all the taxpayers of Canada
to pay charges in line with the actual cost to
the taxpayer.
It was pointed out that the Government
already collects $200 million a year from all,
types of such user charges. However, these
charges have not been recently revised to
meet the current levels of costs or charges,
and the Government bas therefore undertaken a systematic review and revision of these
amounts. The minister indicated that in all
probability the Government might introduce
some new charges as well as increasing the
existing ones. It was stated that in almost al
cases the rates could be adjusted or added toi
under existing legislation.

SENATE DEBATES
However, the Government, through the
Department of Transport, makes very large
annual expenditures for the construction,
equipment, operation and maintenance of airports. In addition, the Department of Transport supplies other important and far-reaching services in the field of air services,
administration, control of civil aviation, air
traffic control, radio aids to air and marine
navigation, and meteorological services.
The total expenditures of the department
on all these services in the last fiscal year are
estimated to be $73 million. On the other
hand, the revenue obtained from user charges
and rents of one kind and another amount to
only $41 million, leaving a deficit of $32 million. In order more nearly to balance expenditures and revenues in this field, the minister
announced that Parliament would be asked to
levy a charge on the price of tickets for carrying passengers in or from Canada. Such a
charge cannot be enforced under existing
legislation, and this is the reason for the
amendment to the Excise Tax Act proposed
by Bill C-155. When the charges or taxes
imposed by Bill C-155 become effective, it is
estimated that a yearly revenue of about $20
imillion will be raised. This sum will, of
course, be paid into the Consolidated Revenue Fund and so reduce the existing deficit of
the Department of Transport in connection
with airports and other transportation facilities from almost $32 million to about $12
million.
Having decided that it was necessary to
impose this tax or charge, the Government
then had to decide whether the tax should be
imposed solely on a percentage basis or on a
flat rate. Both methods are in use by other
countries at the present time. Having in mind
no doubt the arguments for and against both
types of tax, the Minister of Finance stated
that the Government would consult with the
air carriers about the detailed problems of
defining and administering the proposed new
tax. Accordingly, meetings have taken place
between air carriers and their associations
and the Government, and the bill before us
incorporates and reflects many of the proposals and suggestions of those experienced in
these matters concerning the application and
administration of the tax.
Transporting passengers by air is not, of
course, solely a Canadian operation, and
therefore in drawing up this bill it was necessary to bear in mind that the air transportation business operates across international
boundaries and is world wide. For example,
[Hon. Mr. Cook.]

December 17, 1969

passengers often have a choice, and instead of
travelling by a Canadian airline might just as
easily travel by an airline of another country.
In the case of airlines in the United States,
the tax is an ad valorem tax of 5 per cent on
domestic flights. With the exception of travel
into Canada and Mexico, the U.S.A. does not
impose a tax on international air transportation.
Having taken advice and duly considered
all aspects of the matter, the Governiment bas
decided that the proposed tax will be in the
case of international travel a fiat rate tax,
and in the case of travel in the North American area-that is, travel within Canada and
the U.S.A.-on a percentage basis. Therefore,
in the case of tickets purchased in Canada for
transportation within Canada, and for transportation from Canada to the U.S.A., and also
to the islands of St. Pierre and Miquelon,
the tax will be 5 per cent of the purchase
price. In the case of tickets purchased in
Canada for fiights overseas the bill will
authorize a tax at a fiat rate of $5.
However, the bill further provides that by
order in council the $5 fiat rate may be
reduced to $2. The reason for this provision is
that the Government was advised that there
should not be too large a difference between
the tax levied in Canada and that levied in
the U.S.A. Therefore, as long as the U.S.A.
does not levy a tax on international flights,
it is proposed by order in council to set the
Canadian tax at $2 per ticket. There is, however, before Congress now a bill which, if
passed, would increase the ad valorem tax on
domestic and Canadian flights from 5 per cent
to 8 per cent, and would also impose a flat
rate tax on overseas or other international
fiights of approximately $3. If this should
happen, the Canadian tax will revert to the
amount of $5, as provided in this bill. The
difference then would still be $2, which will
not be so great that travellers will be
encouraged to travel on American airlines in
preference to our own airlines. The Canadian
tax is a consumption tax, which means it is
imposed not on the person of the traveller but
on the purchases in Canada of air transportation tickets.
I trust the foregoing will give honourable
senators an explanation of the purposes and
objects of Bill C-155. The bill amends the
Excise Tax Act by adding a new part to be
known as Part II.
The first section of the bill contains the
necessary definitions, including what is or
what is not a "certified air carrier" and what
is a "taxation area".

December 17, 1969

SENATE DEBATES

The main provisions of the bill are, of
course, the sections that impose the taxes or
charges I have endeavoured to explain to
honourable senators. The tax is authorized by
sections 10 and 11. There are a number of
further amendments which are consequential
to the main amendment which imposes a tax,
and which are the usual and general type of
amendment necessary in these cases.
Section 7 provides that the Act will come
into force on a day to be fixed by
proclamation.
I do not think it would serve any useful
purpose for me to endeavour to explain these
definitions and consequential amendments in
detail. No doubt questions arising on these
points will be fully explained by the officers
of the Department of Finance and the Department of Transport during the committee
hearings that will be held in due course,
should the bill receive second reading.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: Before the honourable
senator concludes I should like to ask him a
question. Does the flat rate tax of $5 on tickets purchased in Canada for transportation
outside of Canada and the United States
apply to the one-way ticket or does it apply
to a two-way ticket? Would there be a tax of
$10, for instance, if a passenger went to
London and back and bought the ticket in
Montreal?
Hon. Mr. Cook: I am afraid that question
stumps me. I would think it probably would
be $5. I am afraid the honourable senator will
have to wait until he can ask that in committee. I am sorry I cannot answer that question.
Hon. Jacques Flynn: Honourable senators,
as the sponsor (Hon. Mr. Cook) indicated,
there may be some technical points to clarify
in committee. In any event, we are indebted
to the honourable senator for his explanation
of the bill. We on this side of the house are,
of course, in agreement with the general principle that the public should be called upon to
pay for the services it receives from the Government. As had been mentioned, the cost of
providing air transportation facilities in
Canada represents huge amounts for the
public treasury. I understood from the budget
speech delivered last June that it was
estimated there was a deficit of over $41 million, if I remrnember correctly what the sponsor
said.
Hon. Mr. Cook: I said $31 million.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: I understand also that this
new tax which is to be imposed by this bill

would provide a return of about $20 million,
leaving a deficit for the current year at least
of $11 million.
This tax, in our view, is not entirely fair. It
is calculated at 5 per cent ad valorem on
tickets covering flights or trips in Canada, in
the United States, and to St. Pierre and
Miquelon, or, let us say, in the territorial
limits of North America. For the other trips
the tax is a flat rate of $5 which can be
reduced by order in council to $2.
As far as trips within the area of North
America are concerned, it is to be noted that
the more you stray far from large centres the
more you pay, notwithstanding the fact that
you may not use the air transportation facilities more than someone who would fly from
Ottawa to Montreal or Montreal to Toronto.
There may be in fact the use of only two airports, and the facilities pertaining thereto,
but yet you might pay ten times more if you
fly, for instance, from Vancouver, or especially from the Northwest Territories or the
Yukon, where they have no other means of
transportation. This is really quite a burden
to impose on those people. As far as international flights are concerned, it is a flat
rate of $5. If it is imposed only, let us say,
on the one-way ticket, it would be the
equivalent of an airport charge of $5 when
you leave Montreal for London, for instance,
and you would not pay on your way back
when you land in Montreal.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Provided you have a
return ticket.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: Of course, but I understand that with any airline operating international flights the passenger would have to
pay if the ticket is purchased outside Canada
to come to Montreal. Would there be a tax? I
do not know, but if there is none, it would
not be equitable. I am quite sure that everybody would agree with that.
Honourable senators, it seems to me that
this problem which is facing the Government
is one that should have been dealt with otherwise. To me, presently, the use of the air
transportation facilities, including the airport,
is a problem between the Government itself,
the Department of Transport, and the airlines. I do not see why the Department of
Transport has not established a rate system
whereby it would lend the facilities to the
airline. Then the airlines would have to
determine the price of the ticket in accordance with the services. I think they could
certainly do that, because now, in establishing

SENATE DEBATES
the price of a ticket, they take into consideration all those factors. For instance, if you
travel from Quebec to Ottawa direct, you will
pay less than if you make two separate trips,
one from Quebec to Montreal, and another
from Montreal to Ottawa.
In other words, in establishing the rates of
transportation by airlines, all these factors
are taken into consideration and generally in
an equitable way. If they are not, the Transport Commission can intervene. Presently,
this tax does not distribute the burden fairly.
Furthermore, as has been explained by the
sponsor of the bill, it does not even solve the
situation, because we are still left with a
deficit of $11 million which is charged to the
public of Canada generally, including those
who never use air transportation facilities,
who never buy a ticket and make a plane
trip.
As far as the system for imposing this tax
is concerned, we are far from satisfied that it
is really the method which should have been
followed. It may be that, after some experience with it, the Government will find another way.
We know very well that in other countries
they impose an airport charge. When you
land at an airport you have to pay so much
for landing. If you use only two airports on a
trip you have to pay only at the airport
where you arrive at the end of your trip. But
if you use several, you must pay the tax
several times. That is much more equitable
than the system provided in this bill.
I would like to draw the attention of the
Senate to the proposed new section 18, which
deals with the regulations that the Governor
in Council may adopt. It says:
18. The Governor in Council may by
regulation
(c) exempt from the operation of this
Part the transportation of a person by
air on any classes or groups of commercial air services, commercial air carriers
or aircraft;
(d) determine for the purposes of this
Part when transportation begins or ends
() at a point in Canada,
(ii) at a point in the taxation area,
(iii) outside Canada, or
(iv) outside the taxation area;
These two paragraphs seem to give the Governor in Council the power to enlarge considerably the field of application of the tax, or
even to restrict it in a manner which could be
entirely inequitable. If you can exempt, for
[Hon. Mr. Flynn.]

December 17, 1969

instance, from the operation of this bill the
transportation of a person by air, you can
decide that so and so would not be forced to
pay the tax. And if you can determine the
taxation area, if you can determine that
transportation begins outside Canada, then
you go much further than has been indicated
at the beginning of the bill, where it is said
that it is inended to tax where tickets are
purchased in Canada for a trip from here to
outside North America, or a point within the
United States. One can, by the powers given
to the Governor in Council by these paragraphs (c) and (d) of the proposed section 18,
completely modify the field and the method
of application of this tax.
It may be that there is an answer, and I
shall wait to hear the answer we can obtain
in committee.
Honourable senators, on the whole, excepting this proposed section 18, which in my
view goes much too far, I will summarize by
saying that this tax, which seeks to apply
a valid principle, will not be an equitable
tax; and in this respect we cannot support
the principle thereof.

READING

Hon. Nelson Raienbury moved the second
reading of Bill C-8, to amend the Children of
War Dead (Education Assistance) Act.
He said: Honourable senators, Bill C-8
deals with an act that has been in existence
for approximately 16 years. Since it came into
effect in 1953, it has made it possible for 4,801
orphans of veterans to carry on post-secondary studies.
This is not the first amendment to the
original bill. In fact, the act of 1953 has
been amended four times, cach amendment
designed to make its provisions applicable to
children not originally covered, and to increase the amounts needed for tuition and
other expenses relative to acquiring an education.

their lives. Who knows how much that suffering has shortened their lives as well as preventing them from enjoying life as other
people do.
I think we can be proud of the fact that
Canada has accepted its obligations towards
its veterans; and this bill is but further
evidence of that fact. It can also serve another useful purpose, I think, and that is to
remind all of us that brave Canadian men
fought and died in a great cause. It will serve
to remind all of us, too, that we believed and
made it our policy, as part of what we call
the Veterans' Charter, that veterans should be
given some special consideration in regard to
employment in the Government service.
I must confess that in recent days I have
been disturbed and distressed by the news
that some war amputees have been laid off as
part of the so-called austerity program of the
Government. I think that those who served in
the armed forces and who came back to civilian life unharmed have a very special obligation towards those who are not so fortunate. I
should like to quote a paragraph or two from
today's Globe and Mail, from an article headlined, "Amputees lose jobs in austerity
drive". This is an item from Calgary:
'This is a terrible thing to do to men
after 25 years, especially those who have
to work 10 times harder than others at
being a man.'
Mrs. Charles Kent was commenting on
the dismissal of her husband, a war
amputee, and other war amputees from
their jobs in the civil service as part of
the federal Government's austerity drive.
Mr. Kent, 47, is a $9,400-a-year welfare
officer with the Department of Veterans

not be required after Jan. 31.

During the first ten years of its existence
the act covered children whose parents, either
father or mother or both, were killed or died
as a result of World War II.
Three new categories were added during
the next few years. They included children of
veterans killed in Korea and of deceased
members of the regular forces and deceased
World War II pensioners. The present amendments, two in number, are designed to clear
up a grey zone which presently exists.
The first amendment, which incidentally is
the first recommendation to come before Parliament as a result of the Woods Commission,
deals with a group of children, not over 100
in number at the present time, who come
under section 25 of the Pension Act, wherein
the Canadian Pension Commission is authorized to pay a pension on compassionate
grounds in certain cases where the claimant
is not otherwise entitled to a pension.
The second amendment concerns students
under the act who fail their examinations. As
it reads now, the act provides that if a student, having failed in one or more subjects,
fails again in more than one supplementary
examination he or she shall lose his or her
eligibility for further assistance.
This amendment is designed to clear up
any anomalies that might presently occur
depending on the institution the student is
attending so that if the student cares to
repeat the year at his or her own expense, he
or she may become eligible for promotion to
the next succeeding level of the course of
study under the provisions of the act.
Unless it is requested, honourable senators,
I see no need to send this bill to committee
for study. I might add that it has already
received the unanimous approval of the veterans affairs' critic in the other place, and if I
could get unanimous consent here I would
move that it be given third reading in the
Senate tomorrow.

SENATE DEBATES
the Department of Transport for 17 years and
was given one week's notice that his services
would no longer be required. This matter was
brought to the attention of the President of
the Treasury Board. He gave an explanation
which I think was a most extraordinary one.
In relation to general policy he declared:
-that
a scheme for the declaring of
redundancy and lay-off procedures was
evolved after very lengthy consultations
with the employee representatives in the
National Joint Council of Canada. Agreement was reached on a philosophy for
declarations of redundancy and alternative disposal of such cases. The general
principle was that merit should be the
sole test in determining the order of
redundancy and that as a consequence
this would be the predominant factor, but
that humanity and considerations of
humanity would have to be taken into
account.

December 17, 1969

Would he explain a little more clearly what
happens to the student who, when he loses his
supplementaries, also loses his right to assistance? If I have understood him correctly, that
seems to be a very hard provision in the bill
and one which I could not accept.
Hon. Mr. Ratenbury: Honourable senators,
my understanding is that there exists at the
present time different rules in different
universities and other places of learning that
come under this act. In some universities the
student is not even allowed to take supplementary examinations. I cannot tell you the
reasons for that. However, to clear up this
anomaly, where the student fails and he has
not the privilege of taking a supplementary
examination, under the existing legislation he
would be denied any further assistance. Now
he can repeat his year at his own expense
and get reinstated in the ensuing year.

SENATE DEBATES

pioneer chain saws, the ordinary saws for the
cutting of wood, Honda motorcycles and Mercury outboard motors. They carry on a
modest but reasonably large business in and
around the Lachute area.
The owners of the business were horrified
to find out in due course from their accountants that in July 1969, as a result of notices
that were filed in the normal way in the
Canada Gazette pursuant to the provisions of
section 125 (12) of the act, the company,
McOuat Investments Limited, lost its charter
and ceased to exist because of the mere routine failure on the part of the employees to
file over a period of three years-I think
under the present act the delay now given is
only two years-but under the law as it then
existed it was a failure to file returns for
three years. Honourable senators who are
engaged in the practice of law will appreciate
the routine problems when clients turn up
somewhat blanched on the occasions they
find themselves in that position.
When the attention of the owners of
McOuat Investments Limited was drawn to
these requirements, they communicated with
the Department of Justice who advised them
that the only possible remedy for them in the
unfortunate position in which they found
themselves was to proceed to the Senate and
in due course to the other house for the purpose of reviving the charter of the company
as if it had not been surrendered pursuant to
the notice in the Canada Gazette.
Further, the owners themselves, through
their counsel, proceeded to communicate with
the Minister of Consumer and Corporate
Affairs, the Honourable Mr. Basford. The
letter from him was shown to me by counsel,
and the minister stated that he appreciated
the difficulties that had arisen and he did not
object, in principle, to the revival of the
charter of this company, but pointed out that
the authority for bringing about the revival
would have to be handled by the method we
are now adopting in bringing this bill before
this house-a rather cumbersome procedure
and one we might well consider rectifying by
way of possible amendment to the Canada
Corporations Act.
The bill itself is obviously very simple, consisting of only two sections.
The first section merely refers to the
notices that appeared in the Canada Gazette
of June, 1968, and July, 1969, which had the
effect of cancelling the viability of the
company.

Section 2 provides, firstly, that within 60
days following royal assent to this bill, all
the returns that should have been filed will
be filed in order that the parties in interest
may get relief. Secondly, it is provided that
if the returns that should have been filed
are not filed, the relief contemplated by this
bill will not be granted. And, thirdly, it is
provided that nothing in the act shall be
deemed to deprive the directors, shareholders or the company, of any rights or discharge them or any of them from obligation
or liability incurred since the issuance of the
original Letters Patent, and the said company shall continue in existence as though
it had never been dissolved.
So, in effect, honourable senators, the
objects of this bill are comparatively simple.
Under normal circumstances, I hesitate to
ask-as I will be asking in due course-to
avoid the necessity of referring this bill to the
Standing Senate Committee on Banking,
Trade and Commerce, but I am in the hands
of senators on that point. There was a view
expressed that it should be referred to that
committee, and if that view prevails I will so
move, if, as and when this bill is read a
second time.
Hon. Arthur W. Roebuck: Honourable senators, the honourable Senator Martin asked me
to look into this matter in his absence because of the fact we are about to adjourn
and this is something that should be taken
care of promptly in order to allow this company to continue in business.
I read the bill as carefully as I could in the
short time at my disposal. It seemed to
me that there was very little to it, that as
a matter of law it merely allows this company
to file its reports nunc pro tunc and to continue to do business. Having read the bill and
having heard the explanation given by Senator Phillips, I can see no reason why it should
not be referred at once to a committee for
study and report.
Hon. Mr. Choquette: What are you going to
study, if it is so simple? I am all for cutting
the procedure short.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Copies of the bill have
not been distributed and examined by honourable senators. In the circumstances, while
I am ready to approve it, as far as I have
seen it on careful reading of the bill, I am
perfectly satisfied to send it to committee.
I do not think it should be passed peremptorily without reference to a committee.

Hon. Mr. Croll: Well, for the lawyers who,

think it important that there be a committee

come before the committee and say, "On
such-and-such a day we did not file when we
should have," and so that something appears
on the record and it is cleared up once and
for all. If you do not do that here, it will
have to be done in the other place, and I
think that in the company's own interest it
should go to committee.

This will necessitate the construction of a gas
pipe line between Falcon Lake in Manitoba,
to Fort Frances in Ontario.
Inter City Gas has no power under its
charter to construct or operate a pipe line
which crosses provincial or national boundaries, and that is the reason for this incorporation.
Upon incorporation ICG Transmission Limited will apply to the National Energy Board
for permission to install a pipe line. The
contract between Inter City Gas and Boise
Cascade calls for the completion of that
pipe line by October 31, 1970. In order to
meet that completion date the construction
will have to commence by May 1970, and,
therefore, it is necessary to have the application before the National Energy Board early
in 1970.

it should be referred to a committee. We depend very largely upon the officials of this

THIRD READING

The Hon. The Speaker: Honourable senators, when shall this bill be read the third
time?
Hon. A. Hamilton McDonald: Honourable
senators, on behalf of Senator Laird with
leave of the Senate, I move that the bill be
read the third time now.
Motion agreed to and bill read third time
and passed.
MASS MEDIA
COMMITTEE AUTHORIZED TO MEET DURING
SITTINGS OF SENATE

Hon. A. Hamilton McDonald, with leave of
the Senate and notwithstanding Rule 45 (1)
(a), moved:
That Rule 76 (4) be suspended in relation to the Special Committee of the
Senate on Mass Media from 20th to 30th
January, 1970, and that the committee
have power to sit during sittings of the
Senate for that period.
Hon. J. Campbell Haig: Honourable senators, the question of committee meetings

during the sittings of the Senate has come up
before. We have had the same problem with
the Special Senate Committee on Science
Policy. I have been called out of the chamber
to form a quorum on that committee.
I do not think these committees should
meet during sittings of the Senate. There is
plenty of time during the week for all meetings. If they have to bring in witnesses, the
committees can sit on Monday or Tuesday
morning. It is possible that we will have
many of these committees meeting. This
morning there were meetings of the Standing
Senate Committee on Banking, Trade and
Commerce, the Standing Senate Committee
on Transport and Communications, the Special Senate Committee on Science Policy and
the Special Senate Committee on Mass Media.
Our work could be spread out over more days
than Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday. The
special committees dealing with poverty, mass
media and science policy could meet on
Monday, Tuesday morning, and Friday.
I do not like the suggestion that the special
committees meet while the bouse is sitting,
especially if there is no deadline to meet.
Mass Media has no deadline to meet. The
same situation is not as it was with the Rules
Committee. We did not sit while the bouse
was sitting; we sat an hour before or an hour
af ter.
All I am suggesting, sir, is that when this
house meets again in the new year this question of committees meeting while the house
is in session be seriously considered by a
committee or by the whole house. This motion
will likely pass that the Mass Media Committee be permitted to sit between January
20 and 30; however, a schedule may not yet
be made up. I do not think the chairmen of
special committees should set up a schedule
whereby they bring in outside witnesses and
hear them while the bouse is sitting. If you
will recall yesterday afternoon we came quite
close to not having a quorum, because when
these committees meet at 2.30 there is an
exodus of senators from the chamber. My
opinion is that this question should be seriously considered by the officers and leaders
of the house.
Hon. A. Hamilton McDonald: Honourable
senators, by and large I agree with the
thoughts that have just been expressed by
Senator Haig. However, I am sure he will
recall that until recently special committees
have had the privilege of sitting while the
house was sitting without even asking for
permission from this chamber. Of course, that

SENATE DEBATES
procedure has been changed. He will also
recall that the Mass Media Committee was
organized in September. At that time they
had proposed meeting during sittings of the
Senate, and of course we opposed that and
adopted this new procedure making it necessary for them to come to the Senate to get permission to meet while the house is sitting.
It is my understanding that the Mass Media
Committee is desirous of winding up its work
at the earliest possible date and to sit virtually all day when they meet. One of the reasons
for this is to save money. We have been
spending large amounts of money on special
committees, and this is an effort to cut down
on the expense, as well as an effort to get
their report in as quickly as possible.
Like Senator Haig, I hope that this chamber
will be very tough when it comes to granting
permission for special or standing committees
to meet while the house is sitting.
I agree that sometimes our ranks are
thinned here because of committee meetings
while the house is sitting. We have had too
many committee meetings recently, and it has
been difficult to get enough senators to sit in
the house, staff all the committees and meet a
quorum.
I feel that this assembly should be very
stringent with regard to allowing committees
to meet while the house is in session. However, on this occasion I feel that we should
give this permission to Mass Media.

Hon. Mr. McDonald: They have the power

Hon. Mr. Flynn: Then the motion is concerned only with the power to sit during sittings of the Senate. You said when the Senate

BUSINESS OF THE SENATE
Hon. Paul Martin: Honourable senators, I
take this opportunity to say that the present
inten'ion is that when we adjourn this afternoon we will return tomorrow at Il o'clock
a.m., although we may have to change our
intention and adjourn to another hour.
Senator McDonald bas gone to see what
progress is being made in the other place and
whether there are any further bills to come
over here. We will be having royal assent
tomorrow afternoon, after which we hope to
adjourn until January 20. That will depend
on the information Senator McDonald gets.
I would remind honourable senators that
there are a number of important bills to
receive royal assent tomorrow. I am sure you
will recognize the importance of our being
here for that purpose.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: May I say that as far as
we on this side are concerned, the date of
January 20 is satisfactory, but I would remind
the honourable leader that the Senate can
always be recalled before the date set; therefore, if the volume of business would suggest
adjourning to January 27, that would be a
better solution, because if necessary we could
be called back on January 20.

He said: Honourable senators, Bill C-171,
entitled An Act to Amend the Company of
Young Canadians Act, is a simple bill.

SENATE DEBATES

Hon. Mr. Grosart: May I ask the honourable Leader a question? To what number on
the Order Paper is he speaking?
Hon. Mr. Choquette: It is not on the Order
Paper.
Hon. Mr. Martin: Before Senator Grosart
entered the Chamber I asked, with leave of
the Senate, that this order, which came by
way of message from the House of Commons
to the Senate, be dealt with later this day.
We are now dealing with it, under Rule 44,
in its proper place, as a result of the decision
taken earlier today.
Hon. Mr. Grosart: I presumed it would be
item No. 6.
Hon. Mr. Smith: It is not numbered.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: It is up to the house to
decide that.
Hon. Mr. Choquette: It would be before
item 4.
Hon. Mr. Martin: This will be the last bill
to be dealt with today. I have no objection to
doing that, but I point out that if we are to
leave here tomorrow, we have to pass the
necessary legisiation. That is why I am dealing with the bills now. I do not know what
the disposition of the Senate may be as to
whether this particular bill should go to a
committee. If it goes to a committee, it would
have to be considered this evening or tomorrow. Then it would have to be reported back
and receive third reading if we are to adjourn
tomorrow. That is why we are now dealing
with the bills seriatim. I trust that explanation is satisfactory.
Hon. Mr. Grosart: Quite satisfactory. But
the phrase "later this day" normally means at
the end of the order paper.

December 18, 1969

The amendment would also require the
delivery to the comptroller, upon his request,
of all records, documents, books or accounts
of the Company and the furnishing to him by
employees of the Company of such information, reports, and explanations as he deems
necessary for the proper conduct of his duties.
Any request of the comptroller would be
enforceable by an order of the Exchequer
Court made on application of the Attorney
General of Canada.
On October 22, 1969, the Secretary of State
proposed that the Company of Young Canadians be studied by a standing committee of the
other place. It was decided to review the
activities of the Company because of recent
allegations concerning certain of the activities
of certain persons within it. The committee
was therefore directed "to consider and report
on the legislative framework, organization, and
operations of the Company of Young Canadians," and it reported to the other place on
December 5. In its report, the committee reaffirmed the original purposes and objectives of
Parliament in creating the Company of
Young Canadians. It was of the opinion that
those purposes and objectives could be realized and were, therefore, worth maintaining
and developing. It also took note of some of
the accomplishments and successes of the
Company of Young Canadians.
However, the committee was distressed, as I
am sure many others were, by the deficiencies
in the organization and operation of that
body. The committee noted that "the lack of
administrative procedures has resulted in
almost chaotic conditions and rather unconventional financial procedures", as I am sure
the Leader of the Opposition intends to
remind me. The committee concluded that
there was a need to protect the expenditure

annual budget of the Company has to be
voted by Parliament, and if Parliament votes
the sums required to meet its budget annually, I do not see why it would not require
a complete and full report frorn the Company.
In this respect I think the Department of
the Secretary of State should be blamed.
Even if the company were autonomous, I do
not see why it was not called upon to render
a full account of the sums provided by Parliament for its activities. In this respect both
the Government and the Department of the
Secretary of State cannot simply excuse themselves by saying the act provided for the
Company to have complete autonomy. I do not
agree with that. There are other public corporations which operate in an autonomous
way, but the Government requ:res an accounting of the sums it puts at their disposal.
Hon. Mr. Martin: In any event, we are correcting it now.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: For the time being, this
bill will provide for the appointment of a
comptroller.
I am not too clear as to whether the comptroller is to act only in respect of sums which
will be spent from now on, or whether he will
be called upon to investigate all the activities
and all the administrative records of the company for the past years. I suggest that if such
authority is provided in this act, the comptroller should exercise that power. He
should not restrict his activities to what is
going to happen until we have new legislation
concerning the Company; he should dig into
the past and bring in a full report. The public
is interested in finding out exactly what went
on, and it would be useful to know exactly
how things went in this organization. We
might obtain useful information as to the way

officer, employee, volunteer-member or
technical or professional adviser of the
Company shall, when requested to do so
by the Comptroller, furnish to him such
information, reports and explanations as
he deems necessary for the proper carrying out of his duties.
It appears to me to be optional, that the
comptroller may or may not do it, but I think
he should.
Hon. Mr. Martin: So do I.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: That depends on what
his duties are.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: Yes. Section 10A.(l) states,
in part:
-shall
appoint a Comptroller of the
Company who shall hold office during
pleasure and shall be paid by the Company such salary as is fixed by the Governor in Council.
But it does not say exactly if he will be
responsible only for future operations or if he
will have to do something about the past. I
suggest that he should go back and dig and
find out exactly what has been happening.
The Canadian people deserve to be informed
on this matter.
The honourable Leader of the Government
has said that legislation will be presented to
implement the recommendations of the committee of the other place. We shall have to
wait to see what kind of legislation will be
laid before Parliament, but the reputation of
the Company of Young Canadians has been so
severely damaged that I feel we might as well
abolish it entirely and start all over again, if
it is deemed worthwhile to do so. The public
generally, in my view, would welcome a decision of that kind from the Government, and
would like to forget this adventure as a
nightmare is forgotten.

SENATE DEBATES

Hon. Mr. Fournier
(Madawaska-Restigouche): Will his appointment be permanent?
Hon. Mr. Martin: There now remains in the
Treasury about $900,000, and the Government
is anxious to have control of this money. The
only way in which it can be given control is
by this amendment to the act. There is an
expiry date in this measure, and the comptroller's duties will cease on that date.
(Madawaska-ResiiHon. Mr. Fournier
gouche): Will the comptroller be a person
employed by the Treasury Board, or will he
be appointed from outside the public service?
Hon. Mr. Martin: The appointment has not
yet been made. I can assure the honourable
senator that he will not be someone who has
hitherto been connected with the Company of
Young Canadians.
Hon. Mr. Grosart: Will the honourable
sponsor of this bill tell the house whether the
comptroller will have authority to withhold
future payments from any officer, employee,
volunteer, member, or technical or professional adviser who is already under contract to
the Company?
Hon. Mr. Martin: This bill gives him that
power.
Hon. Mr. Grosart: Is that power given him
under the act or under the regulations?
Hon. Mr. Martin: Section 10A.(2) provides:
No payment of any money shall be
made by the Company and no contract or
other arrangement providing for the payment of any money by the Company shall
be entered into or have any force or
effect unless approved by the Comptrol1er.
Hon. Mr. Grosari: To make my question
clear, does this mean that this bill will supersede any contract held by any person with
the Company of Young Canadians?
Hon. Mr. Martin: It means that none of the
$900,000 now in the treasury can be paid
out in respect of any commitment, either
past or future, without the approval of the
Comptroller.
Motion agreed to and bill read second time.
THIRD READING-NEXT SITTING
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, when shall this bill be read the third
time?
Hon. Mr. Martin: Honourable senators, I
move that this bill be placed on the Orders of
the Day for third reading at the next sitting.

Hon. Mr. Flynn: Honourable senators, it is
apparent from the motion of the honourable
Leader of the Government that he does not
intend to send this bill to a committee. We
have discussed this, and after thinking it over
I agree that referring the bill to a committee
would serve no useful purpose at this time.
However, I would indicate to the honourable
Leader of the Government that when the new
legislation is presented to us we will expect
the comptroller to appear before a committee
of this house and give a full report. I emphasize that we shall expect a full report, so that
we will know exactly what is the situation.
It is obvious that the appointment of a
comptroller is urgent and that to refer this
bill to a committee will serve no useful
purpose.
Hon. Mr. Martin: I fully agree.
Hon. Josie D. Quart: Honourable senators,
had I given more thought to the matter I
would have participated in the debate on the
motion for the second reading of this bill. I
thoroughly agree with what the honourable
Leader of the Opposition has said, but while
he was speaking the thought occurred to me
that I should bring to the attention of the
house two wonderful youth organizations, the
Boy Scouts and the Girl Guides of Canada,
both of which have proven their worth over
many years. During Centennial Year they
organized sleeping quarters for some 4,000
Guides and Scouts, and they were volunteer
guides at Expo.
When the Company of Young Canadians
was proposed I spoke in favour of it-may
the Lord forgive me! One of the meetings of
youth organizations called at the time was
attended by a member of the National Committee of the Girl Guides Association, and she
reporled that she was not too impressed with
the set-up. It had been discussed by the
National Executive at the time, and it was
thought that perhaps CUSO, or organizations
such as the Scouts and Guides, should have
been subsidized a little more. We have ail
seen what has happened to the Company of
Young Canadians. In my own opinion, it
should have been abolished long ago.
It is ironical that last year the grants to the
Girl Guides and the Boy Scouts were cut
drastically on very short notice. I am a
member of the National Executive, after
having been a Divisional Commissioner of
Guides, and I can say that we were very
discouraged at that time upon being told our
grant was to be reduced.

is influenced, there are at least two very distinct schools of thought, not only in the country at large but within the Liberal party
itself. Therefore, the terms "old left" and
"new right" will serve the purpose as well as
any others.
I do not know what proportion of the Liberal party, of liberal-minded Canadians, identify themselves with the new right. For the
sake of Canada I hope that they represent a
majority, but, if not, at least, a growing minority which will grow even more rapidly as
a result of my remarks this afternoon.

SENATE DEBATES

Therefore, at one time they use it as though it
were the same word as "philosophy", at another time as though it were the same word
as "psychology", and at still other times as
though it meant a social economie system.
Actually it is none of these. Whatever meaning we would like it to have, or whatever
meaning we may attribute to it for our own
and
purposes, is absolutely irrelevant
immaterial. The only thing that matters is
what ideology means to the communists and
to their leaders.
There are other characteristics I could mention, but these are the main ones which I
intend to illustrate later from Senator
Lamontagne's speech.
The characteristics of the new right are
practically the direct opposite of those I have
just mentioned. We are not opposed to
change; we realize that change is inevitable,
but it is not to be sought for its own sake.
When a policy change becomes necessary we
want to know what the new direction is going
to be and why. In answer to the why, we
want solid evidence based on cold, hard facts
and not on wishful thinking or on somebody's
opinion and conjectures.
We remember that Lenin advised his followers "to resort to all sorts of devices, manoeuvres, illegal methods, evasion and subterfuges". We remember that communist morality is not based on a moral code like ours. To
them, everything that serves to further their
objectives is right, good and moral. Everything that hinders their objectives is wrong,
bad and immoral.
We know that Manuilski, one-time Soviet
delegate to the United Nations, said:
The capitalist countries, stupid and
decadent, will rejoice to co-operate in
their own destruction. They will leap at
another chance to be friends. As soon as
their guard is down we will smash them
with our clenched fist.
When, therefore, our friends tell us that the
communists, Russian or Chinese, are now
great fellows and can be trusted, when we see
no basis for such trust, remembering Hitler
and Mein Kampf, we are frankly skeptical.
To use an expression popular with our
neighbours to the south, we are a little bit
"from Missouri." We want to be shown. If the
leopard bas changed his spots, if the communists have abandoned their objectives of
world conquest, then we want the evidence.
The rape of Czechoslovakia, the extension of
Soviet naval power in the Mediterranean and

in the Indian Ocean, the extension of Soviet
influence in Africa, in the Middle East, and in
India, the persistence with which Soviet
agents exploit and promote internal conflicts
in so many countries around the world mean
to us that communists have not abandoned
their objectives of world conquest. Naturally
they would wish us to think so and would be
most happy if we obliged them.
This is not to say that the old left and the
new right have nothing in common. We both
want peace. But the new right does not want
peace at any price, particularly at the price of
freedom. With respect to assistance to underdeveloped countries, the new right takes
second place to no one. But they want to
make sure that the assistance is, first of all,
practical, secondly, well planned, and thirdly,
geared to the country's needs rather than to
the pet schemes of certain individuals
designed to promote their political popularity
and advancement. We are also both in favour
of Canada continuing in NATO under certain
conditions, although we differ as to what
those conditions are, and we both have misgivings about NATO, but for very different
reasons.
With regard to continuing in NATO, I made
my position clear in this chamber on March
21, 1968, and there is no point in repeating
what is already on the record. My misgivings
about NATO are implied in that speech, but
in laying the groundwork of my reply to the
points raised by Senator Lamon'agne it is
necessary for me now to be somewhat more
specific. Basically, my misgivings about
NATO, and its effectiveness arise out of the
fact that NATO bas completely ignored the
fact of the ideological war. They appear not
to have understood what the communists and
their leaders mean when they use the word
ideology. They appear not to have understood
the strategy, tactics and weapons which the
free world must employ, not only for their
own ideological defence but also to enable
them to take the ideological initiative.
Speaking to officers and staff at NATO
headquarters in March, 1958, Air Vice-Marshal Thomas C. Traill of Britain, a former
central Atlantic NATO Air Commander, said:
The war of arms, if it comes, is an
extension of the ideological war. At the
higher levels military and ideological
strategy are one. Together they form the
strategy of this world conflict. If we wish
to survive it is madness to consider one
in isolation from the other. The enemy is
very clear on this. He is equally prepared

SENATE DEBATES
to take an ideological or a military initiative, to use an ideological or a military
weapon. You in this headquarters and the
forces you control are here to prevent the
enemy attempting to take a short eut to
his ideological objective, to prevent him
from trying to force his i deas on his
neighbours with bayonets. The armed
forces hold the ring while the war of
ideas is fought out. It is essential for our
existence that you should hold the ring.
But you cannot keep an idea the other
side of a frontier with bayonets. You can
only do that by taking the offensive with
a better and stronger idea.
General Stehlin, Deputy Chief of the
French Defence Staff, said in October 1959:
We will have a real defence of freedom
when we unite the ideological and military factors. This is total defence. It will
introduce a new weapon-the weapon of
a moral ideology. It is not enough just to
have nuclear weapons. If the free world
is not to be outmanouvred by this new
and powerful weapon, we must meet the
enemy on his own ground and with the
same weapons. It is with the weapon of a
moral ideology that we will secure the
peace and be able ta build a new world.
General Carpentier, when he retired as
Commander-in-Chief of Allied Forces in Central Europe, founded a booklet entitled Revue
Militaire Generale, which was to serve as an

informal publication in which senior military
leaders of NATO might express their views
on military matters. In the December 1959,
issue, General Carpentier himself wrote an
article reminding the NATO leaders of three
things, in which he said:
(1) If they are to survive, the western
nations need an ideology superior to that
of Communism.
(2) Defence at the present time requires
military resources but it also requires
moral resources.
(3) The ideological factor and the military factor must be combined for a real
defence.
So strongly did General Carpentier feel
about this that in the issue of April 1960, on
his own responsibility, he published an article
by Colonel-General Hans Ulrich von Erlich.
The first paragraph of that article reads as
follows:
Today we live in an ideological age. An
army without an ideology is beaten
[Hon. Mr. Carter.]

December 18, 1969

before the fighting starts. A nation without an ideology is already enslaved
before any enemy has crossed its borders.
A man without an ideology is a man who
tomorrow will be without a country. Such
are the realities of the ideological age
which we have unwittingly entered. We
have tried to ignore them. Today, on the
penalty of committing suicide, we must
face those realities.
In the face of the evidence which I have
just quoted-and I could have quoted much
more-it is difficult to believe that NATO
commanders do not understand what is meant
by ideology and ideological warfare, but in so
far as they have disregarded it completely
one cannot help but have misgivings.
What does the word "ideology" mean to the
communist leaders of Soviet Russia and Red
China? The sense in which the word is used
by Air Vice-Marshall Traill, General Stehlin,
General Carpentier and Colonel-General
Erlich proves that they understand the meaning of the word quite well.
What, then, is an ideology as it is understood in the Kremlin, in Red China and by
the military leaders I have just mentioned?
First of all, it is an idea: not just any idea but
a global idea, an idea big enough to embrace
the whole human family, their economic and
social environment, their governments and
institutions and their whole way of life. But it
is much more than a big idea. It is an idea
plus a passion and a plan. A plan implies a
strategy and tactics designed to impose this
idea on all mankind. A passion implies commltment and dedication to give everythingone's energy, one's time, one's possessions,
even life itself-to attain this objective.
Our free democratic society is based on the
idea that man is a created being, and we are
rapidly approaching the season when Christians celebrate the birth of the Prince of
Peace, who we believe was God himself in
human form, come down to earth to demonstrate the Creator's love by redeeming us
from our sins, by teaching us how to live
with one another and to demonstrate the
power available to us if we really want to
follow his reachings and the example that he
set us. We have a written record of His life
and teachings while on earth and a recorded
history of the Creator's dealings with
individual persons and with a people prior to
His birth. These writings contain the moral
law which should govern our relationships
with our Creator and with one another, and
they illustrate over and over again that

December 18, 1969

SENATE DEBATES

human nature can be changed and ordinary
people can find God's plan for their lives and
for their nation if they really want it.
These teachings are the blueprint of a
hate-free, fear-free, greed-free world. Here
we have a stupendous idea, big enough to
embrace the whole human family for which it
was intended. It is a global idea, big enough to
unite East and West, black and white, communist and non-communist. All that is needed
is a commitment to create this kind of world
and then we would have the "moral ideology"
that General Stehlin and others have referred
to. But what are we doing about it? We do
not even bother to live it out in our own lives
or in the life of our own nation, much less do
we have any plan or passion to extend it to
the whole world. What is wrong with challenging Canadians to give God his rightful
place in the affairs of man? Why are we so
timid about it? In World Wars I and II thousands of our generation and the next generation died for their country. Why not challenge
the present generation to live for their
country?
Do we have any idea at all, apart from two
cars in every garage and two chickens in
every pot? The essence of an ideology is total
commitinent, total dedication, and sacrifice.
Is there any idea to which the free world is
totally committed? I think not. How then can
Senator Lamontagne talk about the closing
ideological gap between the so-called Soviet
bloc and Western countries as he does on
page 298, and repeats over and over again on
subsequent pages. How can the ideological
gap be closing when, as pointed out by Air
Vice-Marshal Traill and the general I have
mentioned, the West has no ideology at all?
On page 300 the senator refers to a widening ideological gap between Red China and
the Soviet Union. There is no ideological gap
between Russia and Red China. They both
subscribe to precisely the same communist
idea. They are both totally committed and
dedicated to impose that idea on the rest of the
world. The only difference between them is
over the strategy and tactics that are to be
employed in achieving this objective.
Soviet Russia wants to employ the strategy
of peaceful co-existence. Mr. Khruschev
explained it quite clearly in a speech he
delivered at Novosibrisk in 1961. He said, and
I quote:
Peaceful co-existence must be properly
understood. It represents a continuation
of the struggle between two social sys21498-25

tems, but a struggle carried on by peaceful means, without war and without
interference in the internal affairs of
other countries. For us it is an economic,
political and ideological struggle, not a
trial of military strength.
In explaining the policy of co-existence,
Khruschev was merely restating the strategy
outlined by Lenin when he said, and I quote:
First we will take eastern Europe, then
the masses of Asia, then we will encircle
the United States which will be the last
bastion of capitalism. We will not have to
attack; it will fall like an overripe fruit
into our hands.
Chairman Mao thinks this method is too
slow to succeed. He fears that as the communist society becomes more affluent the new
generations of communists will lose their
dedication and commitment and along with it
their determination to carry the struggle on
to victory. The Kremlin leaders hope to avoid
this through a dedicated party corps and tight
party discipline over the masses, but Chairman Mao would prefer to employ violence
rather than run the risk of losing the ideological war. There is no fundamental ideological
difference between China and Russia. They
are both agreed on their ideological objectives. They differ only as to the best way of
attaining them.
Alger Hiss, an ex-communist, describes the
communist ideology in these words:
Communists are bound together by no
secret oath. The tie that binds them
across the frontiers of nations, across
barriers of language and differences of
class and education, in defiance of religion, morality, truth, law, honour, the
weaknesses of the body and the irresolutions of the mind, even unto death, is a
simple conviction: It is necessary now to
change the world. Their power, whose
nature baffles the rest of the world,
because in a large measure the rest of the
world has lost that power, is the power to
hold convictions and to act upon them.
Honourable senators, the use which Senator
Lamontagne has made of the words ideology,
ideological and ideological gap is in my opinion
very misleading and cannot help but cause
confusion in the minds of Canadians to whomi
we should be giving enlightened leadership
and direction. But there are other instances
which I wish to bring to your attention. In
his whole speech Senator Lamontagne used
the word "communism" three times. Twice at
the bottom left of page 299 he uses it in an

SENATE DEBATES
economic sense and at mid-right of the same
page in a negative sense. In the remainder of
his speech he substitutes the term "dictatorial
socialism"-I regard this as an euphonism.
Socialism, as founded in Britain by Keir
Hardie, and in the Labour movement in the
United States by Samuel Gompers, was a
Christian movement founded on Christian
principles. It had nothing in common with
communism, which is a godless and atheistic
movement. The effect of this use of the word
socialism is to propagate the idea that communism is nothing more than a socio-economic system with emphasis on economics.
Then he goes on to imply that communism is
getting more like capitalism and capitalism is
getting more like communism, and in time
they will merge into a system that will be
neither one or the other but something in
between. I regard this as not only misleading,
but very dangerous because it will contribute
to lulling the people of Canada into a sense
of false security. Earlier I pointed out that
our free democratic society is based on a concept of man as a creative being. Communism
is much more than a socio-politico-economic
system, because it is based on the concept of
man as mere animal and the values and institutions and way of life based on these two
diametrically opposed concepts cannot possibly co-exist together in the same world. One
or the other must eventually perish. Furthermore, communism is a militant ideology dedicated to the enslavement of the free world.
At the bottom left of page 299, the senator
interprets Khrushchev's famous remark "We
will bury you" in terms of Marxist philosophy. There was no need for the senator to
resort to conjecture, because Khrushchev
made his meaning abundantly clear on more
than one occasion. For example, in Warsaw in
1956 he said:
But of course we must realize that we
cannot co-exist eternally. One of us must
go to his grave. We do not want to go to
the grave. They (the western powers)
don't want to go to their graves either.
So what must be done? We must push
them to their graves.

December 18, 1969

And again in Budapest on December 1, 1959,
he said:
We shall never forego our ideological
principles. We are waging and shall wage
an implacable struggle for the MarxistLeninst ideology, for the triumph of the
ideals of communism.
If there is any evidence that the people in
the Kremlin or in Red China have abandoned
their communist ideals and have abandoned
their objective of world conquest, then I, for
one, would like to have some evidence before
I accept communism as merely a socialisticeconomic system.
I come now to the main thesis of the
senator's speech as put forward on page 298.
Briefly stated, his thesis is that any substantial increase in Canada's aid to underdeveloped countries is tied to, and dependent
on, reduction in our military expenditures
generally and particularly in NATO. This is
confirmed by his statement on page 302:
Basically we have to choose... between
continuing our mlitary assistance to
western Europe and increasing our
economic assistance to the underdeveloped
countries.

Let us look at that thesis. When Honourable
Paul Hellyer, as Minister of Defence, went
ahead with integration and unification of the
armed forces, it was estimated that 100 million to 150 million constant dollars would be
saved which could be spent on replacement of
obsolete equipment. This saving materialized,
but it was eaten up by inflation and by salary
increases for armed services personnel. It was
not available for equipment.
The present Minister of Finance announced
some time ago that our present military
budget would be frozen at $1.8 billion for a
couple of years. In the meantime, reorganization would take place involving a reduction in
total personnel strength, and any savings
effected would be spent on modernizing
equipment.
If we brought all our Canadian forces back
from Europe and disbanded them completely,
we would save about $140 million or $150
million. This amount and much more will be
required, for several years to come, simply to

bringing back in June, if they are flot disbanded, will effeet a saving of about $8 million. Whether it is $8 million or $28 million, it
will stili be needed for equipment replacement, because the total budget has been
frozen at $1.8 million.
Why should it be necessary for an affluent
country like Canada, with aur high average
standard of living, to have to decrease
defence expenditures in order to increase
foreign aid? Last year aur grass national product was $71.4 billion, and it has been
estimated that this year it will be $78.2 billion. What are we doing with ail this wealth
we are producing? The figures which I amn
about ta quote have been obtained from. the
Dominion Bureau of Statistics. In 1968
Canadians spent on alcahol $1.48 billion, an
increase of 5 per cent over 1967. We also
spent $1.062 billion on tobacco, an increase of
7 per cent over 1967. In 1968 Canadians spent
$337 million plus on harness racing, and
another $198 million on running races, a total
of $535 million on these twa items, representing a 10 per cent increase over 1967. If the
Canadian people fraze their expenditures an
these three items at the 1967 level, they
would have saved $182 million in 1968, and
assuming a continued growth rate of 5 per
cent there would be over $300 million avallable in 1969. Is it too much of a challenge ta the
Canadian people ta ask them ta cut back a
Uittle on these three items and ta make that
money available for assistance ta underdevelaped countries and the underdevelaped
parts of aur own country?
In 1968 Canadians spent $900 million on
travel abroad, as compared with $789 million
in 1967. No doubt the figures for this current
year are even higher.
In 1967 Canadians spent $206.4 million on
candy and chewing gtun, an increase of 5 per
cent over 1966. In the saine year Canadians
also spent $40.8 million an dag and cat faod,
an inerease of 10 per cent over 1966. Instead
of taking the easy way out and pressing the
Government ta reduce defence expenditures,
why are not Canadians chailenged ta become
personally involved, ta, make little personal
sacrifices, ta assist the poor in ather countries
as well as aur own? If we are tao selfish and
too soft ta accept such a tiny challenge, then
we must be a very sick society Indeed.
In any case, we are not spencung ail the
money that is presently available for aid ta
underdeveloped countries. It is very hard ta
make meaningful camparisons, because funds
are made available on a fiscal year basis and
21498-251

expenditures are accounted for an a calendar
year basis. However, in the last fiscal year
ending March 31, 1969, $294.5 million were
available and in the calendar year 1968,
$214.6 million were expended. For the current
fiscal year ending March 31, 1970, $33.81 mil-.
lion are avallable, and in the calendar year
1969 it is estimated that expenditures will be
over $200 million, but cansiderably less than
the amaunt voted. The unspent balances are
not returned ta Treasury but remaîn available, and if the pattern I have quated for the
calendar years 1968 and 1969 hold good for
previaus years, there must be a considerable
fund available for aid ta underdeveloped
countries over and abave the yearly amounts
voted by Parliament.
A second implication in the senator's thesis
is that Canadian forces are in NATO ta
defend western Europe. In the passage I
quoted a f ew moments ago he refers ta, and I
quote:
Our milltary assistance ta western
Europe;
and a little further down on the same page,
page 302, hie states:
the countries of western Europe are certainly i a much stronger position today
ta provide for their own defence than
they were twenty years aga.
I certainly take issue with the implication
that Canadian forces are in Europe simply ta
defend Europe. The defence of the free world
is indivisible. If Europe falis, neither Canada
nor the United States wrnl survive. Canadian
troops are in Europe ta defend Canada as
much as ta defend Europe because that is
where aur front line of defence runs. Furthermare, it is essential that Canada maintain a
presence in NATO as a symbol of aur belief
in the princîple of collective security.
Finally, honourable senatars, we must
neyer lose sight and we must neyer let the
(Canadian people lose sight of what NATO
and defence expenditures are all about. We
talk about them as though they were ends in
themselves. They are nat. They are means ta
an end. And that end is freedom: the kind of
freedom sought by the Hungarians in their
uprising; the kind of freedom towards which
the Czechs were moving befare they were
re-enslaved; the kind of freedom that thausands in East Germany have risked their lives
ta attain. It is freedom ta go from one country
ta another withaut asking permission; freedam. ta read any paper they want ta read, ta
listen ta any broadcast they want ta hear;

SENATE DEBATES
freedom to write any article they want to
write without being censored, and to criticize
their government without being put in jail.
These freedoms are denied to communists
both in Russia and China.
A person may be killed by a slingshot or
bow and arrow, but he is just as dead as if he
had been killed with an atomic bomb. A
country conquered by an ideology is just as
much conquered as if it were done by force
of arms. Once our freedom is lost it is not
easy to get it back. The freedom we enjoy
today has been dearly bought. It is too precious a thing to take any chances with and
we would be grossly derelict in our duty to
our grandchildren and coming generations if
not only did we fail to ensure their freedom,
but by our words and actions or lack of
action, and by confusing issues, we helped to
set the stage for their enslavement or
destruction.

I have discussed with the Leader of the
Opposition our business tomorrow. We will
consider third reading of the bill dealing with
the Company of Young Canadians, and proceed
with the Income Tax bill, which will be
spoken to by Senator Fournier (De Lanaudière). The Leader of the Opposition has had
an opportunity of seeing the general purport
of that bill, and he believes that it would be
possible for us to conclude it tomorrow.
There will be several other items of business. One will be a statement by Senator
Langlois with regard to his recent journeyings into Asia. We are all looking forward to
that presentation. I personally look forward
to it, as I had looked forward today to the
expressions of the new left, old left, new right

The Hon. the Speaker inforrned the Senate
that a message had been received from. the
House of Con-mons with Bill C-139, to amend
An Act to amend the Income Tax Act.
Bil read first time.
SECOND READING

The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, when shail this bull be read the second
time?
Hon. Sarto Fournier, with leave of the
Senate, moved the second reading of the bill.
He said: Honourable senators, the purpose
of this bill is to extend for one year the

surtax of 3 per cent irnposed i 1968 for the
years 1968 and 1969.
The bill is entitled "An Act to amend An
Act to amend the Income Tax Act." This is
because chapter 38 of the Statutes of Canada
1967-68 is to be amencled rather than the
Income Tax Act. In 1968 an Act was passed to
amend the Incarne Tax Act, cited as chapter
38 of the Statutes of Canada, 1967-68. It provided that section 104A be added to the Incorne Tax Act to impose a 3 per cent surtax on
individuals and corporations, and section 4(2)
thereof provided that the surtax would apply
for 1968 and 1969. The bill now before the
house rnerely substitutes 1970 and 1971 for
the years 1969 and 1970, where appropriate in
the coming-into-force section of the amending
act passed in 1968.
The surtax on individuals is 3 per cent of
basic tax in excess of $200. Basic tax is cornputed by the graduated rate schedule after
any dividend tax credit, but is before deducting the provincial abatements, or the special
1966 tax reduction of 20 per cent (maximum
$20) on any foreign tax credits. It is also before adding the Old Âge Security tax or the
Social Development tax.
The surtax on corporations is 3 per cent of
a corporation's tax cornputed before reducing
the tax by the amount of the provincial
abatement and before adding the Old Âge
Security tax.
The tax on corporations wml be extended
by this bill to profits earned ini 1970. Where a
corporation has a taxation year, part of which
falls in 1970 and part in 1971, the tax will be
that proportion of the tax that the number of
days of its taxation year failing in 1970 bears
to the number of days in the whole taxation
year.
The surtax on individuals applies only to
the arnount of basic tax in excess of $200.
This resuits in ail who have taxable
incomes-that is to say, icorne after al
exemptions and deductions--of less than
$1,643 being exempt from ail surtax. It is
estirnated that about 2,500,000 taxpayers, or
about 30 per cent of the total, will be exempt
frorn this tax in 1970.

Hon. Jacques Flynn: Honourable senators, I
agree with the sponsor of the bi; his expianation is entirely satisfactory. We know precisely what this bil seeks to achieve, and
what it wil do.
As you know, it is a watered down version
of the famous bill which was defeated in
February 1968. Normally the Government
was supposed to resign or eaul an election, but
it asked forgiveness fromn the house and
obtained it, in circumstances that appear, in
retrospect, rather amusing. At the beginning,
the bill sought to impose a surtax of 5 per
cent. Then, to meet the rules and to avoid
presenting a second bill identical with the one
which had been defeated, a bill was introduced to impose a surtax of 3 per cent on
individuals and corporations.
At that Urne the tax was imposed because
it was felt in international financial circles

SENATE DEBATES

Successive tax increases have been presented as anti-inflationary measures, and no
doubt they would have been, if the money
had been used to build up a surplus so that
the Government could stay out of the bond
market. Instead, these successive tax increases
have been exceeded by increases in Government spending, and this has served only to
contribute to the inflationary spiral.
What this country needs is not more taxes,
but an efficient control and a more intelligent
set of priorities in Government spending.
This bill, as the explanatory note would
have it, is temporary. It has been temporary
since it was first introduced in 1968. It was
supposed to be for one year only.
Let us not forget all this fancy double-talk
in the White Paper on Taxation, which incorporates this surcharge in a new standard
charge. But let us remember that very often
what is supposed to be temporary has a way
of becoming permanent. Was that not the case
with income tax itself? When it was first
imposed about fifty years ago it was supposed
to be a temporary measure. Honourable senators will remember that it was entitled Wartime Income Tax Act-a title which was retained even during the twenty years of peace
which followed the First World War.
The use of the word "temporary" in the
explanatory note strikes me as cynicai. It
exposes the unbridled arrogance and callous
indifference of this Government toward the
Canadian taxpayer.
Last year 37 per cent of the gross national
product was taken by the public sector. It is
now estimated that within five years their
share will rise to 41 per cent. In order to
bring about this increase in its share, the
public sector will have to seize 45 per cent of
the gross national product-45 cents out of
every new dollar worth of production.
This bill may appear innocuous enough,
but, in fact, it will take $220 million from the
Canadian taxpayer-as has been admitted by
the sponsor-and already the same Canadian
taxpayer is possibly the most heavily taxed
person in the world.
The bill is entitled an Act to amend an Act
to amend the Income Tax Act. I predict,
honourable senators, that next year we will
have a bill which will read, "an Act to amend
an Act to amend an Act to amend the Income
Tax Act."
Hon. Arthur W. Roebuck: Honourable senators, I do not understand the process of an act
to amend an act that amended an act, unless

we are going to re-re-enact the act that
amended the act in the first instance. I am
quite serious about that. I do not think it is
effective. We passed an act, we have amended
that act, and that amendment became effective and was acted upon, and now we propose
to amend the amending act without passing
the amending act after it has been amended.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: It was passed last year.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: That is true, but we are
now going to change it and not make it applicable to the original act. I very much doubt
the effectiveness of a proceeding of this kind.
Unless we pass the second amending act, and
then re-pass the amendment to make it effective against the original act, I very much
doubt the effectiveness and I would like an
explanation.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: Well, I am not going to
defend the Government on this. I suggest it
might well have been improved.
(De Lanaudière):
Hon. Mr. Fournier
Honourable senators, I am far from being an
expert in these affairs. We always have to
have a title, so that the people to whom we
are talking will know what we are talking
about. Here we are talking about an amendment that was already passed to the Income
Tax Act, and we are proposing to amend that
amendment. It is just a matter of name, and
it all leads to the same result, because the
moment the Income Tax Act was amended,
the amendnent became part of it. I suppose
we might have called it an amendment to the
Income Tax Act, but in an attempt to clarify
the situation, and to satisfy the members of
the other place as well as honourable senators, we have intituled the bill "an Act to
amend an Act to amend the Income Tax Act."
In my opinion it may appear to be a bit
complex, but it is actually very simple and I
have no objection whatever.
Hon. Allister Grosari: Honourable senators,
an interesting point has been raised. I think
the obvious reason for having the bill presented in this form is that the Government is
not prepared to admit that this is not a temporary addition to the taxation of Canadians.
If it were presented in the form that Senator
Roebuck would like, it would be an act to
amend the Income Tax Act, and that would
be an admission on the part of the Government that this word "temporary" in the notes
is a mere camouflage. Perhaps we could have

SENATE DEBATES

a word from the sponsor of the bill as to the
meaning of the word "temporary" in the
explanatory note and also used in his statement. What does the Government mean by
"temporary"? Is it prepared to assure us that
this is a temporary surcharge on basic
taxation?

AGRICULTURE
GRAIN

STORAGE AT THE LAKEHEADQUESTION AND ANSWER

Hon. Hazen Argue: Honourable senators, I
should like to ask the honourable Leader of
the Government in the Senate a question. It is
prompted by a press report shown to me a
few days ago indicating that the quantity of
grain in storage at the Lakehead at the present time is exceedingly low. It was reported
that there are some 24 million bushels of
wheat, and a lesser amount of other grains, in
terminals which have a total capacity
approaching 100 million bushels.
The producers are greatly disturbed that
this situation should prevail at a time when
there are literally no standard quotas available in respect of grain for delivery. The producers are anxious that this situation be corrected as quickly as possible so that they
might market their grain.
My question is: what action is being taken
to fill the terminal elevators so that farmers
will have a chance to deliver their grain?

Hon. Mr. Grosart: -on what is still a rare
occurrence in this chamber. The main offenders in this regard are still those who have
charge of the business of the house. I refer
particularly to the Leader of the Government
and his deputies who have not yet, for some
reason, decided to do this chamber the
courtesy of asking leave within the rules. A
case in point was the important bill that was
presented to us earlier today on which leave
was not asked within the rules. I submit to

SENATE DEBATES

idea of this whole movement. Initially, it was
to give young Canadians with ideas, ideals
and idealism a chance to use their talents to
bring about what we would all agree is
needed, social reform in certain areas. We
should institute a legitimate means by which
this desire for reform might be channelled,
instead of allowing the older generation to
block off and appear to impede on every
occasion this idealism among youth.
I have my own family, and I think of my
own children and young son-in-law. Sometimes their ideas are frightening, but basically
they are good children. If they have this kind
of idealism and this desire for reform, even
though some of us who are older think it
wrong and misplaced, we should treat them
with great tolerance. While we take every
step to prevent violence and breaking of the
law, nonetheless we should not close our
minds to what was a good movement in the
first place, and one which at this time I consider should be maintained and continued as
a principle and an idea.
I refer now to another item which demonstrates that it is possible for the older generation to be just as intolerant as we consider
some of the younger generation in some of
their ideas. I regret to refer to an incident
that happened in the City of Regina on
Monday, December 8. I am sure that most
honourable senators have heard about it. In
Regina on that day a young man, 19 years
old, and under suspicion by the police, was
coming out of a building. He was asked to
halt, but did not and proceeded to run away.
The police shot at him three times, hit him
twice and killed him. He was unarmed. In my
opinion that kind of action by the police is a
most important aspect of this troublesome
situation.
After this incident some of the young
people in Regina demonstrated against what
had taken place. The local Chief of Police,
with many of whose statements I disagree,
some weeks ago advocated publicly that the
merchants of that city should be armed so
that in the event of an attempted robbery they
could shoot the robber on sight. I know that
some people may feel that this kind of action
should be taken, but it seems to me that by
doing this we would create a climate of violence. Whether that climate is created by the
C.Y.C. or by the police themselves using bad
judgment, it should be criticized and should
not be condoned.
A statement was issued by the Chief of Police
of Regina regarding this incident. The police
21498-26J

officers involved were not named. A few days
earlier the R.C.M.P. had made the largest
number of arrests and seizures in relation to
narcotics in the history of Saskatchewan. A
newspaper report, which was attributed to an
undisclosed R.C.M.P. source, listed the names
of all those who had been arrested, together
with the circumstances of their arrests. This
might prejudice those who will be considering
this action at a future date. However, the
statement issued by the Regina Chief of
Police regarding the shooting incident did not
disclose the names of the officers involved.
By using these references I am suggesting
that good Canadians in the Senate and in the
House of Commons should regard our youth
with great tolerance. We should admire their
idealism and do everything we can to be talerant and to channel this idealism in a constructive direction. If our young people make
mistakes their behaviour will in no way be
improved nor can it be corrected by older
Canadians in responsible positions acting in
an unjustifiable manner.
Hon. Chesley W. Carter: Honourable senators, I certainly agree with Senator Argue
that the basic idea upon which the Company
of Young Canadians was founded was sound.
It was intended to mobilize the idealism of
youth and put it to good service in the interests of Canada, and of uplifting the lives of
Canadians who are more or less in the
deprived class. I point out to Senator Argue
that that is not what happened. Idealism was
conspicuous by its absence. There is no one in
this chamber or in Canada who is against
idealism, but I think we would be very foolish
if we did not, after seeing what has happened, take steps to prevent the same mistakes recurring.
One of the reasons the C.Y.C. is in this
trouble is that sufficient care was not taken to
make sure that the Company was made up of
Canadians motivated by idealism. Yesterday's
edition of the Ottawa Citizen carried a story
about two members of the Company of Young
Canadians who were not Canadians at all, but
were from the United States. One of them
was receiving $350 a month and the other
more than $400 a month. After an investigation carried out on these persons, during
which many weeks were spent in contacting
them and trying to get reports from them, it
was learned that they were doing nothing
related to the work of the Company of Young
Canadians. When things got too hot for them,
they both disappeared completely. It is all

SENATE DEBATES
very well to talk about idealism, but we must
be realistic as well.
Before concluding, I should like to comment
on what Senator Quart said yesterday. She
pointed to the good work being done by the
Girl Guides, the Boy Scouts and organizations
of that nature, and told us that recently the
grants to these organizations have been drastically reduced. Earlier this week there
appeared before the Special Committee of the
Senate on Poverty, of which I am a member,
representatives from the Frontier College.
This organization is doing great work, much
along the lines of that supposed to be done by
the Company of Young Canadians. The Frontier College employs young people from
universities, mainly on a part-time basis
during the summer months, and a small
number, about twenty-five, in the winter
months. These are idealistic young people
who are well screened and supervised. This
was not done with the Company of Young
Canadians. They are given basic training and
sent out, some of them working in labour
camps, upgrading the workers' education,
others developing leadership in communities
and groups. The Frontier College representatives told us of projects being pursued in
different parts of Canada, one of them in
Newfoundland. They send these people out on
the understanding that they will work in the
communities to which they are sent, doing
whatever work they can do. If they are working with railroad gangs, they work on the
railways; if they are working in fishing communities, they work in a fish plant or do some
allied work. In addition to whatever they can
earn from their occupation, the Frontier College pays them a supplement amounting to
about $1,200 a year. For that expenditure of
$1,200 per person, these workers from the
Frontier College can upgrade twenty to thirty
people academically and develop community
leadership in the group.
In the evidence given to the committee by
the representatives of the Frontier Collegewhich is doing wonderful work and producing
remarkable results for a small overhead of
about $1,200 per person, compared with the
$13,000 per person for the Company of Young
Canadians-they told us that their grant also
had been cut, and cut drastically, as Senator
Quart pointed out was the case with the Girl
Guides and Boy Scouts.
I take this opportunity of drawing to the
attention of the Government Leader the great
work that is being done by the Frontier College, and I ask him to use his influence to see

have read their reports, and I have read
reports by others about them.
I must say that I become a little weary
when distinguished senators like Senator
Argue and Senator Carter talk in this house
about idealism. In the hard stony ways of our
lives, idealism is not enough. I also get impatient of the use of the word "tolerance".
People say that we must tolerate this and
tolerate that. It is the most abused and
misused word in the English language. If you
tolerate a thing, it is because you think it is
wrong. What I believe these people mean is
that they have sympathy with these ideals.
We do not tolerate murder, rape or lawlessness. We try to understand what is behind
such behaviour.
The weakness in setting up the Company of
Young Canadians was that it gave them a
position of responsibility and a task which
was all sail and no anchor. If these young
people wished to make a contribution in this
country, there was a clear, established way in
which they could do it. This is a parliamentary country. All that we have, all that we
have been, all that we hope to be, is enshrined in our parliamentary system. If these
young people really wanted to make a contribution in Canada, their task, their job, was to
join one of our political parties and make a
contribution in that practical way.
The trouble with most movements such as
C.Y.C., and the trouble with most of our
society, is that it is all know-how and no
know-why; all signposts and no destination. It
is not enough to say that you are an idealist
if you are preaching nonsense. The Company
of Young Canadians should never have been
set up in that way. These young men should
have been told by our leaders, by our schools
and by our clergymen what democracy in this
country is about. It does not mean a lot of
young men calling themselves idealists, running around with crazy ideas and crazy
motives. It means getting down to the hard
tasks of government in the hard and stony
places of the human spirit. As a young man I
joined a political party, and I have worked
for political parties ever since, because I
believed and convinced myself that that was
the only practical way of getting the right
action, or what I thought was the right action,

December 19, 1969

DEBATES

in ry country. Yes, ail signposts and no
destination.
The basic trouble is in our educational
system. We Canadians have neyer rightly
understood what true education is about. We
have thought it could be judged by what we
see in huge auditoriums and buildings, bricks
and mortar. We confused, and we continue to
confuse, vocational. training with education.
Education is flot sornething to give a man a
standard of living. It is something to give him
a standard of life, and, until we understand
that, we wiil continue making mistakes in
what we call our edueational system. Education is nat samething ta make a mani a
lawyer, a doctor, an engineer or a priest: it is
ta make him a mani. When our schools and
educational authorities begin to realize that,
then we wiil avoid in future, I hope, the nonsense of a Company of Young Canadians being
given money and free rein ta do what they
thought was right.
The mistake these yaung people are making
is in their belief that if you corne later you
must be wiser. That is what is wrong with
organizations such as the Company of Young
Canadians-a disrespect and disregard for the
past. I have said again and again, in the
Senate and outside, that the belief by the
younger generation that everything that has
been done has been wrong, that they are
wiser because they are younger, is samething
which flies in the face of ail human history
and human experience.
I have often recalled what the great Renan
once wrote in Souvenirs of My Youth. Here
was a mani who was a great schalar who
quarreled with his church. R-is church
appealed to history against him, and he
became one of its mast formidable antagonists. Yet, in his declining years, in a passage
of mournful and haunting beauty hie spoke of
the importunities of youth, recailed the days
when he heard the church beils an the Breton
coast summoning hlm ta his prayers. "I could
not choose but hear," he said, and hie pleaded
with men flot to forget the past, but at least
ta bow where they could not pray. This is the
trouble wtth aur yaung Canadians, a trouble
we see with toa many of the youth ail over
this land. They have not been taught to
respect the past, to realize that there have
been great traditions and deeds and great
men in histary, and that the young may flot
have all the answers.
We, too, of an alder generation and older
faith, have a love of Canada and we are
trying our best.

I hear young men going arour.d sneering at
what they cail "professional paliticians." Not
long ago, when speaking at a university, a
young mani from the audience said ta me,
"We have respect for public men. What we
disrespect are professianal, politicians." I
replied ta him this way: Young marn, do you
know who the professional politicians were?
Burke, who is always on your lips, was a
professional politician. He gave up ta party
what was meant for mankind. Canning, Pitt,
Fox, Gladstone, Disraeli and the immortal
Churchill, ail were prof essional. politicians.
We corne to the United States, and who is
there but Abraham Lincoln, the glory of freedom and democracy. He was a professianal
pahitician. So also was Daniel Webster, Henry
Clay and Calhaun.
Then corne to your own country. Who were
the people who made this Confederation?
They were professional. politicians. If Confederation had been left to the young people i
Canada, regardless of their ideals, or had
been left ta lawyers, doctors, businessmen
and such people, Confederation would neyer
have taken place. It was left ta John A. Macdonald, a pro ta, his very care, and ta Jacques
Cartier, a pro ta his very care. It was left ta
Thomas D'Arcy McGee and the athers. These
were the men who built Confederatian, just
as professional. paliticians i England were
the men ta build. up the Empire, which is now
the Commonwealth. For heaven's sake, let us
not tolerate this continuous smearing of
public men and paliticians.
I feel that in aur high schaols and universities respect for demacracy, the Parliarnent,
and an understanding and respect far the
party system, should be taught. Personaily, I
have no patience with the young peaple who
are running araund calling themselves idealîsts and advocating policies which, as I said,
are all sail and no anchor.
Hon. Mr. Carter: May I ask a question?
Does Senator O'Leary not think that the
characteristics of youth today, ta which he
has just referred, is not sa much the fault of
the educatian, but the fault af the training
they are getting from their university professors acrass Canada, particularly i the faculty
of social science.
Hon. Mr. O'Leary (Carleton): I do nat know
haw you distinguish between the training of
professors i universities and what I have
said about aur kind of educatian, generally.

SENATE DEBATES
Hon. Arthur W. Roebuck: Honourable senators, I agree very strongly in the first instance
with Senator Carter in his report of what took
place in the Poverty Committee when we had
before us the representatives of Frontier College. They are doing splendid work.
We have a considerable number of illiterate
people in this country, not because of any
fault of our educational system but because
many of them have come here from places
where the educational methods and facilities
are far below ours. I would like to see the
Frontier College given every possible support.
I am not going to criticize the C.Y.C.,
because I do not know enough about it. Of
course, I stand with Senator O'Leary in
expressing disapproval of giving young people
or old people public money to go out and
spend without supervision and responsibility.
It may be that we have sinned against these
youngsters rather than their sinning against
us, or perhaps we have both sinned in that
regard. Now we are going to take a little
better control and it may be that things will
improve.
I should like to say something about youth.
It is a mistake to criticize youth in a general
way. I do not sec the degradation of the
younger generation, as sometimes expressed
by older people. I can go back, but only
hazily, into my own youth and find that if I
think too closely I will blush at some of the
things I said and did. I am not different from
anyone else in this room in that regard. We
were all immature when young. Perhaps some
of us are still a bit immature, but do not
forget that those who come to our attention
are the eccentric few among the great mass of
young people. But, to take it as a whole, these
young people of ours are well educated, much
more so than we were. They are serious and
hard-working young people. Go to the colleges and see them working. You will, of
course, find a few who may have too much
money in their pockets and they raise hell,
but there are just a few. The great mass of
them are good students, seriously working for
their own careers in the time to come, and I
honour the young people.
I have sometimes expressed the hope that
the young today would have more intelligence
than we ever had, because we have much to
apologize for. Witness the conditions that we
tolerate. If you excuse the word, Senator
O'Leary, we have tolerated some bad conditions in this country, and poverty is one of
[Hon. Mr. O'Leary.]

them. I hope that the young people, when
they take over, will have had some experience. I am in favour of lowering the voting
age, because the youngsters of Canada have
greater maturity than we had when we were
young. I want to see them take their responsibility. I like to see them thinking and
expressing their thoughts, if they are honest
thoughts, even if I think them, in part, wrong.
I like to see thern entering into the dialogue
and discussion of public affairs. I honour the
young people. I am hopeful for the future
because of them. I think they are the best
educated, the most moral young people that
have ever existed on this planet. I look
strongly to them, and I will pass on my
responsibility to the young people that I
know, with a reasonable degree of confidence.

REFUND OF FEES TO PETITIONERS

Hon. Alan Macnaughton: Honourable senators, with leave of the Senate, I move, seconded by Hon. Mr. Denis, that the fees paid on a
proposed bill respecting Salon Juliette Ltée
be refunded to the solicitor for the
petitioners.
Honourable senators, perhaps I should
explain this motion. This petition was filed
during the last session of Parliament and
subsequently was abandoned by the petitioners. The sum of $300 was paid-$200 parliamentary fee and $100 deposit on the cost of
printing the bill. As the petition was not presented and the bill was not printed, no
costs were incurred by the Senate. The solicitor is Mr. D. E. Nicholson, of the Ottawa law
firm of Lieff and Nicholson.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, with leave of the Senate, it is moved by

PUBLICATION OF REVISED EDITION

Hon. Har±land de M. Molson: Honourable
senators, I should like to draw your attention
to the little book which vou will find on your
desks tonight. It is a copy of the Rules of the
Senate which is now in final form.
As you will remember, the committee
which was entrusted with the task of examination of the rules did its work a year ago
last autumn, and finally in December a year
ago the Senate in its wisdom approved the
rules and instructed that they be printed in
suitable form in English and in French,
together with an index and an appendix containing the Forms and Proceedings of the
Senate.
In May 1969, we received an advance copy
of the Rules of the Senate only, which I think
was helpful, although it had one or two rules
which still required amendment. Until now
we have been operating under the Rules of
the Senate as set out in that advance copy.

Hon. Mr. Pearson: Perhaps that is what it
means, but it does not say that.
Hon. Mr. Leonard: If honourable Senator
Pearson looks at Rule 5 covering definitions
he will find that this matter is dealt with.

I would ask the consent of the Senate to make

and Commerce to which has been referred
the White Paper on Taxation.
Hon. Orville H. Phillips: How short will
the report be, Mr. Speaker? I have the
greatest respect for the honourable senator
and I enjoy listening to him speak but, like
most of us, his definition of "short" can on

occasions be rather lengthy. For that reason I
should like to have some idea as to the length
of time his remarks will take.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: About five or six
minutes. If you want to you may take out
your stop-watch.
Hon. Mr. Phillips (Prince): I would be more
than willing to give Senator Hayden double
that time.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: Honourable senators, as
you know, the White Paper was referred to
the Standing Senate Committee on Banking,
Trade and Commerce shortly before the
Senate recessed at Christmas. We had the
problem of organizing and staffing the committee, but with the able assistance of the
vice-chairman we have succeeded in securing
a first-rate staff. I hope to report in greater
detail on this important matter tomorrow
morning when the committee meets.
So far, we have secured the services of Mr.
Arthur W. Gilmour of Montreal as Executive
Director, and this in turn brings to our assistance his staff because he is the head of the
Montreal branch of the Clarkson, Gordon
firm. We have secured our legal advisor from
the MacAuley firm in Winnipeg. In this
matter we were assisted and advised and
received recommendations from two of our
very good senators, Senator Haig and Senator
Everett. These members of the staff have
been at work organizing our procedures and
the forms in which briefs will be submitted.
Tomorrow we will hear Mr. Bryce and Mr.
Brown. I expect it will be a general questioning session. I would further expect that
because of the nature of their briefs we may
have to cal them back from time to time.
On Thursday we will receive our first submission, which is one from Noranda Mines.
Our sittings on both Wednesday and Thursday will commence at 9 o'clock in the
morning. Before the end of tomorrow
we expect to have secured from Montreal a
highly recommended, qualified and fully
bilingual man who will be our Executive
Secretary. He will analyze the briefs according to a format already settled and will be in
charge of the direction of the staff.
As I have said, honourable senators, we
hope to start at 9 o'clock tomorrow morning
and perhaps will spend five to ten minutes in
camera to present the staff to you and to
discuss matters of procedure. I expect that we
shall start hearing from Mr. Bryce and Mr.
Brown at approximately ten minutes after 9.
[Hon. Mr. Phillips (Prince).]

However, I would like before we start with
them to outline a method that might at the
beginning expedite the asking and answering
of questions because we have some material
that we would like to file at 'that time.
NORTH ATLANTIC ASSEMBLY
FIFTEENTH

ANNUAL

CONFERENCE

BRUSSELS, BELGIUM-DEBATE
CONCLUDED

AT

The Senate resumed from Thursday,
December 18, the adjourned debate on the
inquiry of the honourable Senator McDonald,
calling the attention of the Senate to the Fifteenth Annual Conference of the North
Atlantic Assembly, held at Brussels, Belgium,
16th to 21st October, 1969, and in particular
to the discussions and the proceedings of the
conference and the participation therein of
the delegation from Canada, and to the visit
of the delegation from Canada to NATO
Bases in Europe.
Hon. Orville H. Phillips: Honourable senators, in rising to challenge Senator Hayden I
had a rather ulterior motive in mind. I
thought that if I questioned him and then
gave my consent to proceed, he would be
obliged to sit and listen to my remarks. I hope
he will not find the punishment too severe.
Honourable
senators, in moving the
adjournment of the debate before the recess, I
stated that we had received the views of the
old left and the new left of the Liberal Party
and that we now needed certain facts. My
remarks will attempt to cover a few basic
facts, and I shall then deal briefly with certain fallacies I feel were contained in the
remarks of some honourable senators participating in the debate on NATO. I will not
at this time go into the origin of NATO or its
purposes, because I feel that aspect has been
adequately covered.
The first fact that must be recognized is
that Canada does not have a clear, concise
defence policy. We have a number of press
releases and statements, but we do not have a
clear defence policy. At one time our external
affairs and defence policies were almost the
same. That is, when the NATO policy was
adopted by External Affairs, the Defence
Department followed along. Now we have
utter confusion. External Affairs is sharply
divided on matters of policy with a number
of our NATO allies, and the defence minister
is in difficulty with the Secretary of State,
hoping that he can explain certain foreign
decorations. As I say, the general picture
is one of utter confusion.

January 27, 1970

SENATE DEBATES

During the recess we received the Statement of Policy of the Canadian Chamber of
Commerce, and I felt that the individuals
drafting the section on defence must have
followed the Senate debate on NATO. Firstly,
I would like to read to you two sections from
the recommendations of the Canadian Chamber of Commerce. The first is paragraph 289
which appears at page 74:
Neither geography nor history nor selfinterest will allow our country to adopt a
policy of isolationism or non-alignment or
neutrality. Our external policy, and hence
our defence policy, must continue to
reflect our adherence to the Charter of
the United Nations, our membership in
NATO and our friendship with the U.S.A.
Then paragraph 292, which deals with our
defence costs, states:
Though few Canadians need to be persuaded on the necessity of maintaining
effective armed forces and a credible
military posture, all Canadians are concerned with defence costs. Wasteful and
uncontrolled expenditures cannot be
accepted. Our defence budget must be a
measure of our commitments, external
and internal, no more and no less.
I interpret this as meaning that the Chamber
of Commerce is concerned with the fact we
have fixed our defence budget at a certain
level.
They go on to point out the utter confusion
that exists in our defence policy. In section
293 they say:
The Chamber is disturbed by the Government's stated intention to bring about
a planned and phased reduction of the
size of Canadian forces in Europe, before
having completed the current review of
foreign and defence policy. It is considered that our position would be more tenable, if any Canadian initiative in this
sensitive area awaited completion of the
policy review.
Honourable senators, they then show us
that they are the optimists of the year,
because their first recommendation is that the
Government of Canada complete with due
diligence its review of foreign and defence
policy, and that the results be clearly and
publicly stated.
Honourable senators, far be it from me to
be partisan in any regard, but I find it difficult to imagine this Government being clear
in any of its policy statements. If proof of

that is needed, then a look at our defence
policy is all that is necessary to demonstrate
that decisions in respect to troop withdrawals
from NATO in Europe are already made.
They have been announced and discussed
with our NATO allies, and they are to have
effect from July of this year. Yet, we still
have a policy committee reviewing the subject. I feel that it is about time someone
advised this committee that the decision has
already been made, and that it will be given
effect to in July. Otherwise the committee
might corne out with a report in August that
the
embarrassing to
may be rather
Government.
Other honourable senators who have participated in this debate have described the
origin of NATO. It is not necessary for me to
remind the chamber of the details, but I do
point out that there was a very urgent need
for NATO at the time of its formation. Communism was spreading throughout Europe,
and no country in Europe was able to withstand its onslaught alone. Thus we had the
formation of NATO, and since that time not
one square foot of Europe has fallen to
communism.
On the other hand, the Russians have not
been idle. While they have been waiting for
their propaganda to take effect upon the
Western nations, their navy has been completely rebuilt and modernized. Perhaps it is
worth while remembering, honourable senators, that in the North Atlantic tonight there
are approximately 200 Russian submarines,
many of them nuclear powered and many of
them nuclear armed. The Russian land army
has been completely modernized, and it possesses vehicles that are capable of travelling
over radio-active terrain. They have an
almost identical number of intercontinental
ballistic missiles, equal in force to those of
the United States. Their reconnaissance
bombers shadow the eastern coast of Canada.
To those who feel that communism has
settled into a cocoon, or into a bat-like trance,
to wait for the night when NATO has disappeared, I can only say: "Look at the complete
globe. Look at the influence of communism
throughout the Middle East, Egypt, and
through Africa to Nigeria." Egyptian pilots
were flying Russian MIG fighter aircraft in
Nigeria. Russia has not reformed. It has not
given up its objective of global conquest.
Honourable senators, there was a need for
NATO, and that need still exists. Nothing has
happened during the history of the North

SENATE DEBATES
Atlantic Treaty Organization to call for its
disbandonment.
There are those who feel that we in Canada
do not need a defence force, that we can
depend entirely upon the United States. I
would point out that the American people are
becoming very tired of being criticized for
maintaining huge armed forces, and yet, at
the same time, being called upon to be the
bulwark of the defence of the Western world,
and indeed the democratic world. It is rather
strange to me that those who would condemn
the United States for maintaining such a large
armed force would also say that we Canadians
do not need an armed force of our own because we can depend upon the Americans. At
the same time, these people are very much
concerned about American participation in
our economy, but for the sake of our protection they continue to ask for American military occupation of our half of the North
American continent. This is a type of political
schizophrenia that I cannot understand.
Honourable senators, whether we invite
American troops in to protect us, or whether
we invite those of some other NATO nation,
once those troops come into this half of the
North American continent known as Canada
they are not going to leave very readily. They
are not going to leave because the St. JeanBaptiste Society, the Orange Lodge, the
National Liberal Association, or any other
association passes a resolution urging that
they go home. We are responsible for our own
defence and we must face that fact.
The Americans on numerous occasions have
already served notice that they do not intend
to continue defending certain nations for free,
and at the same time suffer criticism for
doing so. Senator McDonald referred to Mr.
Denis Healey's remarks at the Brussels meeting, in which he stated we were living in a
fool's paradise if we think the Americans are
going to continue their present attitude forever. Mr. George Ball, when he appeared
before the committee of the House of Conmons, emphasized this very fact. He said that
the United States is becoming very tired of
paying the shot for the defence of the Western world, and he urged Canada to continue
to support the NATO organization.
President Nixon, in his address to Congress,
pointed out that the United States will now
start to reduce their defence expenditures.
They will keep their treaty commitments, but
they are net going overboard in respect to
supplying military aid in the way we have
come to expect during the past few years.
[Hon. Mr. Phillips (Prince).]

January 27, 1970

Honourable senators, if I may I should like
to refer for a few minutes to certain fallacies
that have been presented during this debate.
First, if it were not for this horrible creature
NATO and the defence expenditures that go
with it, we could do wonders in the way of
reforming the world; in a sense, we could become international flower children and engage in anti-military mission work. The
people who say this are what I would call
Leacock economists.
Hon.
quotes.

Mr.

Lamontagne:

some

Hon. Mr. Phillips (Prince): I will be more
than happy te do so, Senator Lamontagne. As
you know, this is the hundredth anniversary
of Leacock's birth, and I would like to give a
quotation.
Hon. Mr. Lamontagne: He was one of the
very great men.
Hon. Mr. Phillips (Prince): Referring to
economists, he said:
Take enough of that mystification and
muddle, combine it with the continental
area of the U.S., butter it up on the sides
with the history of dead opinion and
dress it, as the chefs say, with sliced history and green geography and out of it
you can make a doctor's degree in
economics.
I think in all fairness I should point out to
Senator LamontagneHon. Mr. Lamontagne: In medicine too, I
think.
Hon. Mr. Phillips (Prince): -that
had a degree in economics.

Leacock

Hon. Mr. Lamontagne: I have no Ph.D.
Hon. Mr. Phillips (Prince): I am not suggesting that you received your degree in economics at the same time as Leacock did. You
are a bit younger, I recognize that, but I must
say this, sir, that you have mastered the
technique of muddle and mystification and
are well qualified to give lectures in that
regard. If I may I shall refer to your rather
interesting speech for a moment. You made
the suggestion that we send our armed forces
to the emerging nations-of course, they
would be minus uniforms-and they could
help the development of those countries. I am
sure Leacock would have had a field day with
this, Senator Lamontagne. I ask you to imagine our Department of External Affairs

January 27, 1970

SENATE DEBATES

asking the Government of Nigeria or Gabon
to take certain armed forces. Consider the
case of thirty colonels. They have been unified, integrated, stripped of their foreign
decorations, provided with new uniforms,
stripped of all pride and tradition. They have
been certified by the Secretary of State as
what I would call hippie colonels. You could
apply to Nigeria or Gabon to send these
people there to help them. Well, in Nigeria
you know what General Gowon is going to
tell you. He will tell you very explicitly
where to go. Gabon will tell you to go to the
same place and take the colonels with you.
I do not wish to sound overly critical of
your speech. I am trying to point out to you
that you will have difficulty not only in Canada with your idea, but you are going to have
difficulty in the emerging nations because
most of them have better equipped armed
forces than we have in Canada.
Hon. Mr. Lamontagne: You had better reread my speech.
Hon. Mr. Phillips (Prince): May I suggest
that you re-write it, sir.
Hon. Mr. Lamontagne: That was not the
purpose. I will write it in French this time.
Hon. Mr. Phillips (Prince): If you will rewrite that speech I promise that I will try to
read it in French.
Senator Carter pointed out to you that
Canada is already unable to administer its
budget in External Affairs. The thought
occurred to me that if we follow your rather
intriguing suggestion, what would happen?
Firstly, some one is going to suggest that we
need a new department, a new group to
administer foreign aid in these emerging
nations. We could probably hand it over to
the regional development agency, or some
such organization. Ye Gods, honourable senators, what confusion that could cause! We
-could have secession, civil war and a Biafra
every day if we let those boys in. I suggest
that we stick to the more conventional form
of foreign aid.
Senator O'Leary was greatly concerned
when people reported back from the NATO
meetings that they emphasized one aspect of
NATO only, the military alliance. Senator
Robichaud in his rather interesting remarks
dealt with the non-military aspects of NATO.
He emphasized that the Canadian delegation
had participated in the discussions dealing
with the economic and social aspects of life,

what we might call human environment. He
referred to certain motions that had been
passed at Brussels. It is very easy to agree
with one motion, that is, that our efforts to
deal with pollution have proved inadequate
and have failed. However, the resolution
passed urging members of the assembly to
initiate appropriate action in their Parliaments to bring about the recognition of the
North Atlantic Assembly because the parliamentary consultative body of the North Atlantic Alliance leaves some cause for concern.
I refer to a television interview given by
Mr. Philip Givens, Member of Parliament for
York West. He stated that the House of Commons was as useless as an udder on a bull,
for the simple reason that no one listened to
the advice offered by the Commons. I am not
sure, honourable senators, whether Mr.
Givens is of the new left or the old left. I did
have a certain amount of sympathy for him
when he said that he had been a Liberal for
thirty years. That should discourage anyone,
but I leave it to senators opposite to decide
whether he is of the new or the old left.
I found myself in agreement with Mr.
Givens in a certain regard, that the present
Government does not listen to advice offered
by Canadian parliamentarians. This applies as
much to this chamber as to the House of
Commons. What intrigues me is the fact that
Brussels is to become the parliamentary discussion group. Surely no one is naïve enough
to believe that if they speak in Brussels
instead of in Ottawa the present Government
is going to give their views any more
consideration.
Another viewpoint that is often put forward by the Leacock boys is that Russia is
ready and waiting for a NATO cut-back so
that they can match the reduction in defence
expenditures and the maintenance of their
armed forces. Honourable senators, this is
utter nonsense. In 1969 the United States,
despite its heavy involvement in Vietnam,
reduced its defence expenditures by $1.1 billion. The Union of Socialist Soviet Republics
increased its defence budget by $2.4 billion.
The United States has indicated that there
will be a further cut-back this year. If we
could receive some indication of reciprocal
action from the other side of the iron curtain,
those who advocated cutbacks so that Russia
could follow our example would be a bit
more credible. The example has been set on
this side of the iron curtain. Let us see something on the other side.

SENATE DEBATES
We often overlook the fact that the Warsaw
Pact exists to counteract NATO. I would like
to make a comparison of the armed forces of
the countries in the Warsaw Pact with
Canada as a member of NATO. Roumania is
a member of the Warsaw Pact, much smaller
in size than Canada, with a population of 20
million. It has a permanent military force in
excess of 200,000, a militia force of 60,000
which can be mobilized within 48 hours, plus
a border guard of 50,000, a total in excess of
300,000. Canada bas a population of 22 million; our armed forces have been reduced to
around 80,000 and our militia to 20,000, giving
something in excess of 100,000, or a ratio of
three to one in favour of Roumania as
opposed to Canada.
Senator McDonald referred to a certain
proposal concerning nuclear weapons. Honourable senators, I hesitate to keep complimenting a fellow Tory, but I was rather intrigued
with Senator McDonald's proposal. I can see
the feasibility of taking a certain longitude
and latitude, depending on the area of the
world, giving a map reference and saying to
the Warsaw Pact, "If you go beyond this
point you are responsible for detonating the
nuclear weapon and it is your responsibility."
During the recess I read an article by General Fernand Gombiey, the Director of the
French Institute of Higher Defence Studies, in
which be was referring to what one might
term the mini bomb. This is a hydrogen bomb
which is very economic; in other words, it is
cheap; it will not require an atomic bomb to
detonate the H-bomb; this can be done by a
laser beam. I would remind honourable senators who may think of the laser beam as
something of the future, that a laser beam
was directed to the moon on the first Apollo
landing, and quite recently the Canadian
Defence Research Board made an announcement concerning their progress in developing
laser beams.
This weapon, which is in the economic
range of any nation, large or small, rich or
poor, could be put ashore on our coast from a
fishing trawler or a submarine and detonated
by a chemical laser, which is not in existence
at present but will be in the not-too-distant
future. Bearing in mind our large Atlantic
and Pacific coastlines, this is a matter that
should concern Canada particularly, and a
great many of the NATO nations in Europe.
This mini H-bomb, as powerful as any presently in existence, could be placed ashore
and detonated by a laser beam. The frightening thing about this is that we would not be
[Hon. Mr. Phillips (Prince).]

January 27, 1970

sure who placed the bomb there or who
detonated it-in other words, anonymous aggression.
Honourable senators, I draw this to your
attention because Canada has been neglecting
its coastal defences. We have very little navy
left. For the last several years we have had to
tie up most of our naval vessels because we
did not have the personnel to man them at
sea. Our Maritime Air Command has been
drastically reduced. We now have on the
Atlantic coast about 15 Argus aircraft covering the whole coastline, and one of these aircraft is detailed to perform one specific purpose, which is to make a flight across our
northern territories once every two weeks to
assert our Arctic sovereignty. It frightens me
to think that we have let our huge coastline
become so neglected that we can fall prey to
almost any nation in the world. I hope that
both NATO and Canada will give particular
consideration to this aspect in the future.
Honourable senators, in closing I would
point out that if Canada completely withdraws from NATO-and here I am emphasizing the military aspect-the writing is on the
wall, and the free world will be divided, not
among the Medes and the Persians but among
the anarchists and the communists. I would
much rather have NATO than have the world
divided among the communists and the
anarchists.
Thank you, honourable senators, for your
attention.
Hon. Daniel A. Lang: Honourable senators,
I offer my congratulations to the honourable
Senator Phillips (Prince) for his remarks
tonight. I should also like to offer my congratulations to those who have preceded me
in this debate, which bas been on the Order
Paper for some time. Throughout the debate
we have had expressions of honest opinions
held by those who have different approaches
to the problem, and it is in this atmosphere
that we can develop an attitude that may
possibly lead to a better policy. I commend
the Senate for having a debate as extended as
ours bas been on this very important issue.
I have spoken in this chamber before,
perhaps on too many occasions, on this
same subject; my views are already very well
known and I do not wish tonight merely to
reiterate something I have said before. In fact,
I had not intended to participate at all until I
had the opportunity today of reading the
remarks of my honourable colleague Senator
Lamontagne on December 9. Senator Lamontagne is a man of no mean intelligence.

January 27, 1970

SENATE DEBATES

In my opinion this is a leap of the imagination rather than an exercise in reason
and logic. However, I would say that Senator
Lamontagne is not alone in his views, nor in
the conclusions which he reaches, and which I
submit are invalid conclusions based on valid
premises.
His views are very widely shared today,
particularly among the academic community
in Canada. They were recently reflected by
Professor James Eayrs, in his testimony
before the House of Commons on Foreign and
Defence Policy. Indeed, I would surmise they
are not entirely foreign to some of the views
held today in the present ministry of this
country.
In order to substantiate that, I would like to
draw the attention of the Senate to an article

SENATE DEBATES
By all accounts, Prime Minister Pierre
Trudeau took office with at least a strong
inclination to take Canada entirely out of
NATO. Those who know something of his
thinking believe he would really like to
put Canada in some kind of non-aligned
position internationally, to stand virtuously apart from all manifestations of
power politics.

January 27, 1970

position in NATO councils has been very
much downgraded.
It is rather ironic that this should be
happening just at the time when there
are signs of real negotiations beginning
with the East over European security,
with the likelihood that NATO will have
a major role to play in achieving the
stable settlement which is Canada's
declared objective in its European policy.
It goes on to mention the question of our
own internal unity:
Because Europeans (including, to a
lesser extent than most, the British) have
always regarded the viability of Canadian nationhood and independence with
some skepticism, there is a widespread
assumption that the whole thing will
eventually end in some union of North
America.
Canada surely should be trying to
maintain every possible connection with
Europe, and be looking for new ones.
This, in the view of all the Europeans
and Canadian diplomats I have talked to
(and I share it) is the real flaw in the new
Canadian NATO policy; that we appear
to be now beginning to accept what Europeans tend to regard as our preordained
future as a northern province of the
world's greatest power, retreating inta
American continentalism.
The fact remains that NATO is the
only "European" international institution
in which Canada bas been taking an
active part, Canada's only chair at a
European table.
But the impression is of an increasing
and general Canadian indifference to
Europe, under the Trudeau regime. This
indifference is easily reciprocated.

Further on he says:
Beyond that, however, there was something deeper in the European reaction to
Canada's "defection": the belief that the
Canadian move represented not merely
the practical necessity of a redeployment
of limited military resources, but a covert
rejection in principle of the NATO concept, and of Canadian involvement with
European security.
Some Canadian statements attempting
to justify the withdrawal did nothing to
disabuse Europeans of this judgment.
"We are," Mitchell Sharp explained again
and again during his Scandinavian tour
last June, "not only an Atlantic country.
We are an American country. We are a
Pacific country. We are an Arctic
country."
Pacific? Arctic? The implication was
that Canada needed a large part of its
NATO contingent to defend these newly
discovered frontiers. Against whom and
what?
The Government has also argued that,
to carry on with their previous role,
Canadian forces in Europe needed expensive new weapons whose cost would
mean committing these units to the same
specialized role for another 20 years.
On the word of NATO professionals,

[Hon. Mr. Lang.]

January 27, 1970

SENATE DEBATES

was formulated under the leadership of Louis
St. Laurent and Lester Pearson, and that
these changes call for a transformation in
Canadian policies.
Now, I do not think any person would challenge the first part of that statement, but the
second part, though plausible, is not quite as
self-evident. The changes since the post-war
decade include the rifts within the communist
realm, the economie recovery of western
Europe, the emancipation of and increased
turbulence in what is called the third world.
We have also become aware rather belatedly
of the domestic crisis that threatens Canada's
survival as a viable political entity. It would
be surprising if these changed facts and perceptions did not render desirable changes in
policy. They do, in fact. These changes should
take the form of adaptation, of building on
strength rather than upheaval. Indeed, the
notion that this is the moment for a dramatic
new departure in foreign policy not only
betrays a shaky grasp of the international
facts of life but also has already greatly
damaged the effectiveness of our Canadian
diplomacy.
Honourable senators, another rationale that
we hear very frequently today runs somewhat like this: the Soviet Union, which probably never intended to march to the channel
anyway, is now so preoccupied with challenges from within the communist camp that
there is no significant risk of war in Europe.
Given the secretiveness of the communist
political system, it is unlikely we shall ever
be able definitively to establish the intentions,
aggressive or otherwise, of Stalinist and postStalinist Russia. The employment of the
Soviet power in East Germany, Hungary and
Czechoslovakia, however, leaves little doubt
about the Kremlin's disposition to use its
military muscle to achieve political goals
whenever it can do so with acceptable risk.
Nor is there much doubt about the vital role
played by the substantial North American
presence in Western Europe in overcoming
the defeatism, induced by fear of Soviet
power, that impeded economie and political
recovery after 1945.
The relevant question concerns the future
intentions of the Soviet Union. I am not
aware of even a single serious analyst who
claims that the Kremlin has operational plans
for a further march westwards. Most accept
at face value its apparent concern about
China, and its interest in further arrangements with Washington to reduce the risk of
stumbling into an all-out nuclear exchange.

Coupled with promising political trends in
western Germany, these Soviet concerns raise
the genuine possibility of a settlement in
Europe that would permit a reduction in military force in the area.
Soviet moderation, however, has less to do
with moral scruple than perception of external danger. The situation could change radically and Soviet appetites perk up, if any one
of a number of possible developments were to
occur. These include: a relatively short, successful assault by Russia on China; a SinoSoviet accommodation, perhaps after Mao's
death; another change in the character of
Soviet leadership; a decisive reduction in
western preparedness; a return by the U.S. to
a "Fortress America" strategy.
A more probable scenario for the third and
last world war would start with further turbulence in eastern Europe, especially if it
seemed likely to invite West German intervention. While a consensus of informed opinion holds that war in Europe is improbable, a
major assumption is that western military
power will not be dismantled in advance of a
similar cut-back on the Soviet side. And most
experts believe that, if we do stumble into
nuclear war, the likeliest source of confict
would again be located in central Europe.
They also favour a western strategy of "flexible response" even though it is more expensive in manpower involvement. But, today,
because of our Candian policy we are coming
closer to the massive retaliation concept
which had hitherto been discarded.
The NATO governments are all committed
to seek disarmament, especially in the heart
of Europe. The NATO Council is devoting
much effort to the question but, in the light
of experience, it now believes that the only
viable route to disarmament is one of
balanced force reductions. Although there
have been western reductions in recent years,
Soviet "reciprocation" has taken the form of
increasing its military grip over the Warsaw
Pact powers and inserting a powerful naval
force into the Mediterranean.
I come now to a third proposition we hear
frequently, that the west Europeans have
now sufficiently recovered to provide their
own defence, or at least the conventional
portion of it.
This statement, partly true, is often
advanced to suggest that the European allies
should now spend on defence a much greater
proportion of their national income than does
Canada. Honourable senators, this involves a

SENATE DEBATES
fallacy-the false assumption that we are in
Europe to defend Europeans. I think every
honourable senator will recognize that we are
there for no such purpose. We are there to
reduce the possibility of the only war that
would be likely to lead to the destruction of
Canada. We are also there to augment our
influence in global policy-making and to preserve the only set of relationships that afford
any solid counterweight to our increasing
interdependence with the United States. If we
insisted that the Europeans increase their
share in the western defence effort, while
Canada cuts back, we would be contradicting
the principle of collective defence which calls
for equitable sharing.
How, in fact, would the west Europeans
respond if obliged to become largely responsible for their own defence? Social conditions
in Italy and France are such that increases in
their military expenditure could be decidedly
dangerous. Britain is already spending a disproportionate amount on defence, and its
economy is far from sound. The only country that appears to be in a position to take up
the slack caused by departing North Americans would be Germany. For obvious historical reasons there already is concern about the
growing preponderance of Germany in central European defence. At the present time in
Europe one-half of the total NATO forces are
German. If the Germans are obliged to
become even more predominant than they are
now, or, worse still, to acquire an independent capacity to wage war by themselves, the
cause of detente could very well be lost.
Withdrawal of non-European forces without
adequate reciprocation by the Soviet Union
can very likely convince the west Europeans
that they should reduce their conventional
forces and return to a total reliance on massive retaliation by the use of nuclear weapons. This is what we have struggled to get
away from in NATO, and we have almost got
away from it.
The domestic pressures for reduced military budgets are strong in all NATO countries, and few understand the perils involved
in being unable to reply to any Soviet intervention or blackmail except by capitulation
or nuclear suicide. It is thus of Canadian interest that the west Europeans should not be
left to provide their own defence, rather than
the other way round.
We should also recognize that, from the
point of view of deterrence, influence or
detente, one Canadian soldier in Europe is
worth half a dozen Canadian soldiers at
[Hon. Mr. Lang.]

January 27, 1970

home, and the fact is that we could not possibly afford to create the necessary mobility by
aircraft to take troops back to Europe. The
cost would be completely beyond our economic means.
Finally, honourable senators, I wish to mention another argument, and I suggest a specious argument which we hear all too frequently, namely, that NATO has performed a
necessary military function but has failed to
become a political instrument, and may even
be an impediment in the way of disarmament
and detente. NATO has not become, as some
Canadians hoped, the central organ of an
Atlantic federation with economic, cultural
and other functions. It is specifically, no
matter what we say, a military organization,
but I am not so sure that it should be anything other than a military organization.
I think O.E.C.D. today carries out many of
the functions originally envisaged for NATO
and is probably doing so better than NATO
could do it. Is that a criticism of NATO? I
think not, when we consider the other organizations now in existence to carry out the
non-military functions originally envisaged
for NATO. However, so far as the military
functions of NATO are concerned, the consultative processes are working well and have
been for years, and the NATO forum provides
by far the most substantive and significant
deliberation of the major issues affecting
global security, issues such as nuclear contingency planning, non-proliferation, control of
strategic weapons, disarmament and European security. It is doing that and doing it
most effectively.
Then there is the exchange of classified
information within NATO which affords its
smaller members, including Canada, a tremendous diplomatic bargain-the ability at
modest cost to be informed about developments affecting world security and to make
their views known in contingency planning
and east-west negotiations. This is an invaluable asset to Canada. NATO does not, of
course, enable every voice on its councils to
carry equal weight. It is obvious that in the
world of today, where you have large nations
and great powers and smaller nations and
lesser powers, that this cannot be the case.
But most NATO members, most of the time,
fully adhere to their obligations to consult,
even in such vital matters as strategic arms
limitations. The Harmel Report with its
detente concept was not merely an exercise in
public relations as many people are inclined
to think. NATO today is probably giving

January 27, 1970

SENATE DEBATES

greater attention to disarmament and the possibilities of fruitful negotiation with the
Soviet Union than any other body in the
world.
Within the NATO Council, Canada is
rated as one of the most influential of the
lesser powers; in terms of diplomatic effectiveness, its delegation probably ranks right
after the big four, the United States, Britain,
Germany and, at times, France. Canada's
influence has been employed consistently in
the interest of moderation in the use of
power, and imagination in the art of diplomacy. We have nothing to be ashamed of. No
member has contended more vigorously for
cautious planning, for disarmament, and for
the exploration of every opening for detente
with the Soviet Union than has Canada
through NATO. Championing a similar
approach have been the Scandinavian members, Belgium and, much of the time, Britain.
Even if one does not approve of every NATO
decision, it is difficult to see how the general
situation would be improved by withdrawing
or weakening one of the most consistent and
effective advocates of moderation on the
international scene.
As all honourable senators are aware,
NATO has frequently been falsely pictured
as a militarily aggressive organization. I
think we must recognize, however, that
there is a correlation between military contribution and political influence. All members,
even those shirking a reasonable share of the
burdens, have the same right to speak. The
willingness of the others to listen, however,
varies with the reputation of the country concerned, and this point of view is particularly
relevant when considering the issues about
which Canada has been most concerned.
Just to give one example of that, Canada's
effectiveness as a champion of "balanced
force reductions" as opposed to the massive
nuclear retaliation concept has been sadly
diminished by our unilateral cuts which, of
course, make nonsense out of that policy. It is
very difficult to see how our delegation can
continue to advocate a strategy of flexible
response when our cutback is making it more
necessary to rely on massive nuclear retaliation. If we are serious about wanting a
detente in Europe-and I think my honourable colleague was serious in his speech-we
certainly would not be increasing the military
preponderance of Germany in this atmosphere. And, in view of the "take it or leave
it" nature of our basic decision to cut back,
we shall surely have to ease up on our

preaching about adequate consultation before
action, or about equitable sharing of burdens
with our allies.
Honourable senators, I do not want to take
too much of your time tonight. Of course, this
is a question with which I have always been
deeply concerned. I would like to put before
you the arguments you are going to hear
more frequently and why they are, in my
opinion, so invalid in our present context.
Another one you hear often is that most of
the international turbulence and human suffering is now found in Africa, Asia and Latin
America, and that our foreign and defence
policy should therefore shift in emphasis from
Europe to those continents. There is no question that turbulence is very much a characteristic of what we call the third world and
that it will be for many years to come. The
disparity between our world and the third
world is undoubtedly a major scandal of our
times. We should be doing a great deal more
to help, by increased foreign aid, by technical
training and by adjusting our economy to
permit the less developed countries to sell
more here. But, honourable senators, I submit this activity has little to do with the
traditional aims of foreign policy such as
national security, independence and domestic
prosperity. The super powers, Russia and the
United States, have demonstrated repeatedly
that they do not intend to allow any conflicts
in the third world to draw them into an allout war. In Europe they would, because there
their conflict of interest is so direct that that
is where it could happen-not in Africa, not
in South America, not in India.
Another suggestion often made, which
scandalizes me, is that the hungry two-thirds
of the world might march on the wealthy onethird. This is impossible, and I think it is
misleading and cynical in the extreme to present the suffering masses of Africa, Asia and
Latin America as a serious threat to the
physical security of Canada. If we think we
can use aid for political purposes in these
countries, we should think again. These countries receiving aid from us are at pains to
demonstrate they have not been influenced by
what we have done. Aid extended to augment our political influence is wasted; in fact,
it is actually self-defeating.
These remarks are not to be taken as arguing against any increase in our program of
economic aid. In fact, an increase in our economic aid progran is a moral imperative and
is a dictate of our conscience. However, let us

SENATE DEBATES

not kid ourselves that aid, however much
more we put into it, can ever be a substitute
for a foreign or security policy. They are not
alternatives; they are completely separate and
distinct considerations; and I think this is
where we get to the nub of the differential
exposed by this debate. Additionally, let us
not delude ourselves that any moneys we
might save on cutbacks in military expenditure are automatically going to be spent on
foreign aid. I think most of us are sufficiently
politically experienced to know that that is
not a foregone conclusion.
Next, we come to the proposition we hear
continually, that the great threat to our
independence comes from the United States,
and that our defence activity should be concentrated upon this continent to prevent that
dependence. I acknowledge that if we decline
to take any share in the defence of our country, the United States is undoubtedly going to
be very seriously tempted to violate our territorial rights. I think they would be quite
justified in doing so if we took such a position. But by putting all our defence eggs in
the North American basket, we would be contributing nothing to the security of Europeand maybe some people do not want thatalthough it is still the most likely source of
conflict in the world today, a conflict that
would escalate into the destruction of Canada.
Let us be honest: by doing that we are going
to weaken the ties between Canada and
Europe, military or otherwise, which the
Europeans cherish and which we have earned
and should also cherish. It is going to weaken
all our other non-military ties with Europe.
Our economic, political and cultural ties will
be weakened, again resulting in our increasing involvement with and dependence on the
friendly giant to the south. For the foreseeable future I can only imagine that our
involvement with the west Europeans, including the British and the French, will in fact
provide a counterweight to our necessarily
intimate relations with the United States.
This is not a new concept; it is the old triangle concept; but I think it is as true today as
it was when first conceived. If we put too
great an emphasis upon continental defence,
even if ostensibly to promote our independence from the United States, which would be
our public reasoning, it would be counter-productive and would foster the existing tendencies towards continental integration in North
America. Canada really needs Europe now
more than Europe needs Canada.
[Hon. Mr. Lang.]

January 27, 1970

Again, in the area of our economic assistance abroad, we can continue to employ our
influence with our Atlantic associates to counter the inward-looking tendencies they have
and our own inward-looking tendencies. We
can, with them, promote a sympathetic and
responsible attitude toward the peoples of
Africa, Asia and Latin America. We will be
far more effective doing that than severing
our links with them. Maintaining and
strengthening our trans-Atlantic ties and
extending our links with other peoples is
probably the most constructive foreign policy
we can have, and by doing this we shall be
building on the strength we now have.
Finally, although we do not hear as much
about it now as we have in the past, we do
hear the proposition expounded that Canadian unity is in such a state that obviously we
have to cut back on our external commitments, whether they be military or in relation
to embassies abroad, our External Affairs
department, and so on. This disturbs me.
It is my opinion that we have to take some
pride in what we are. Since 1945 we have
probably been one of the world's most consistent and effective promoters of international harmony and civilized standards of any
country in the world. There is no country
with a better record within the United
Nations and, until April of last year, none had
a better record within the Atlantic Alliance.
Our steady but constructive diplomacy since
the Suez crisis has been greatly appreciated
by other countries.
We must not forget that Canada has not
hurt herself by trying to be a responsible and
constructive member of the international
community of the world, although that
Canada bas hurt herself seems to be the conclusion of those who wish to put us into the
continental box. Our total commitment to
external activity in defence, diplomacy, and
aid, in terms of our G.N.P., is less than that
of most other countries of the world-and it
is declining. It is not going up. If we are
presently suffering from inflationary pressures, this cannot be attributed to an increase
in our external activity. If we want to be
honest with ourselves we must say it is
because we are enjoying one of the world's
highest living standards, and have allowed
to run ahead of our
our appetites
productivity.
The United States and Great Britain have
over-committed themselves in world activity,
and they are suff ering because of it. It may be

January 27, 1970

SENATE DEBATES

that they will have to eut back. They are the
ones who are suffering, and not us.
Again, it is argued that by cutting down
our external aid we will preserve our national unity. That, in my humble opinion is a non
sequitur. It does not hold water. Our foreign
policy and the strength of our foreign service
is actually part of the strength of our national
Government here in Ottawa. If we reduce
that then we reduce our strength federally.
Every one will admit, I think, that our foreign
service gives us pride that we are Canadians,
particularly when we are abroad.
Honourable senators, if Canadians cannot
afford a moderately rising commitment to
activity in the world community, then I do
not know what other nation in the world can.
Given our resources, and a relatively fortunate position in a troubled and uncertain
world, it is just immoral to urge a reduction
in our international role, militarily or otherwise, in the name of "realism" or of "national sovereignty" or what have you. To return
to isolationism, whether it be continental or
national, I submit, would be to reject the
finest of Canadian traditions and to revive a
most short-sighted and shabby international
life.
RADIATION EMITTING DEVICES BILL
SECOND

READING-DEBATE ADJOURNED

Hon. Muriel McQ. Fergusson moved the
second reading of Bill S-14, respecting the
sale and importation of certain radiation
emitting devices.
She said: Honourable senators, Bill S-14 is
a bill respecting the sale and importation of
certain radiation emitting devices.
The very rapid advance in the technology
connected with electro-magnetic radiation,
and the application of such technology in the
field of medicine as well as in industry, has
been accompanied by corresponding hazards
to patients in the case of medical X-rays, and
to industrial workers and scientists in cases
where adequate care has not been taken in
the design and construction of equipment.
The Department of National Health and
Welfare for some years has had responsibility
for the health aspects of the use of radioactive substances. The officers of that division
have become increasingly aware of the need
for control in the design and sale of devices
which do not contain radio-active material,
but which do emit electro-magnetie radiation
21498-27

generated by electrie circuits and which utilize electro-magnetic radiation for their
effectiveness.
This bill is designed to provide essential
and primary control, at federal level, over the
design and sale of devices used in medicine,
science, and industry which, if improperly
controlled, have the capacity to emit harmful
radiation.
By "radiation", it should be understood, is
meant the whole scale of radiation from the
low frequency long-wave length infra-red end
of the spectrum through the visible portion
into ultra violet X-rays and other radiation of
a higher frequency short of that emitted from
radio-active sources. Honourable senators may
know, from reading recent magazine and
press articles, that the very rapidly developing laser technology emerges out of uses of
the visible portion of the electro-magnetic
radiation spectrum.
This bill is designed to exclude control over
household articles, which could probably be
made the subject of the Hazardous Products
Act which was passed in 1967. It is also designed to exclude control over prescribed
substances within the meaning of that phrase
contained in the Atomie Energy Control Act.
Its effect, therefore, is to fill a gap which has
heretofore existed, and to apply effective but
reasonable control in this area.
Certain of the larger devices, such as some
X-ray equipment for either medical or industrial purposes, are leased to users rather than
sold and, for this reason, control over the
design of such equipment that might be so
leased was considered necessary.
The technical definition of the sort of radiation, the emission of which forms the subject
of this legislation, is set out in paragraph (g)
of the interpretation section. The lower limit
of a frequency of 10 megacycles per second is
set somewhat below the lowest frequency
which experience internationally has shown
to have been or to be capable of having an
injurious effect upon humans. As I mentioned
previously, section 3 contains the precise
exclusion needed to distinguish the purview
or scope of this legislation from that of the
Atomic Energy Control Act and Regulations.
In the production of equipment of the sort
contemplated by this legislation, there is a
comparatively long manufacturing period and
high unit cost. While the volume of production in this field does not compare at all with
that which pertains in the motor car industry,
because of the value in terms of expended
labour and funds in the production of most of

SENATE DEBATES
the equipment under consideration, it is considered proper to apply the legislation to
future manufacture, which is done by section
4. This will avoid the possibility of instant
obsolescence which otherwise might arise on
the coming into effect of new standards and
regulations, as well as the coming into force
of this measure itself.
It is intended to continue the collaboration
now proceeding with the industry in order
that ample notice of changing standards of
design and protection will be given to manufacturers and importers.
Clause 5 is the basic key clause of the
whole bill in that it contains the prohibition
against the sale or lease of equipment that
does not meet the prescribed standards.
The clause which follows prohibits the
importation into Canada of substandard radiation emitting equipment.
It is, of course, essential that persons be
appointed to inspect equipment proposed to
be sold in or imported into Canada, and
clause 7 authorizes the Minister of National
Health and Welfare to designate persons as
inspectors for the purpose of this act.
These persons will, of course, have specialized technical training. It is intended that
they will be competent to discuss and work
with manufacturers and technical personnel
at the manufacturing stages in order to provide guidance to manufacturers in their
understanding of and adherence to prescribed
standards.
In order that there may be no misunderstanding or embarrassment, all inspectors
shall be provided with official identification as
inspectors under the Radiation Emitting
Devices Act.
Clause 8 provides authority to inspectors to
enter places for the purpose of examining
equipment located therein, and provides
authority to the inspectors to examine packages, documents and papers relating to the
equipment and to make copies. It also contains the usual provision requiring persons
concerned to assist an inspector in carrying
out these duties.
You will notice that this authorizing clause
provides no special or unusual authority to
inspectors beyond that normally provided to
persons with industrial inspection responsibilities. In this legislation it was taken into
account that the nature of the activity forming the subject matter of the legislation did
not suggest that they should have the use of
any special powers for entry into dwelling
[Hon. Mrs. Fergusson.]

January 27, 1970

houses, taking of samples or other unusual
processes which are necessary where other
commodities are involved.
Clause 9 contains the usual provision
prohibiting persons from interfering with
inspectors in their work, or molesting or
interfering with goods which may have been
seized by inspectors in the course of that
work.
Authority is given to an inspector under
clause 10 to seize equipment in relation to
which he believes there bas been violation of
the legislation. This bill omits any authority
for forfeiture under any circumstances of
seized commodities. It is perhaps obvious that
no useful purpose would be served by a
provision which had the effect of transferring
title to radiation emitting equipment that
might be placed under seizure. The clause
does, however, authorize the detention of
such equipment for a period during which the
manufacturer will have an opportunity to
modify it sufficiently that it will no longer be
in violation of the legislation, or will not conflict with prescribed standards.
The effect of the clause is that when a
seizure occurs, the seizure will not continue
beyond 90 days, or the time when the abovementioned modifications are carried out,
whichever is the lesser, or such longer period
as may be prescribed by regulation. An
exception is when within the 90-day period so
prescribed, a prosecution is instituted in relation to the equipment. Where this occurs, the
seizure continues until the prosecution proceedings are concluded.
Clause 11 provides for the making of regulations. The regulation-making authority in
this bill has been confined as much as possible to the basic minimum necessary for the
administration of the act and the carrying out
of its function. In view of the changes and
developments in this branch of physical
science occurring continuously, the need for
prescribing classes of devices from time to
time has been recognized in paragraph (a).
Paragraph (b) of clause 11(1) is related in
that it gives authority to the Governor in
Council to prescribe standards to apply in the
case of the various classes of devices and
their components, standards which will be
considered essential to the maintenance of
safety of persons or patients involved in their
use.
In clause 10 provision was made for detention of seized equipment for a period longer
than 90 days where it might occur that such
longer period was needed to effect the modifi-

January 27, 1970

SENATE DEBATES

cations necessary to bring the equipment up
to prescribed standards. Paragraph (c) of
clause 11 gives authority to the Governor in
Council to prescribe such further period when
necessary.
Paragraph (d) provides authority to make
regulations relating to the disposition of
detained or seized equipment and, in particular, disposition subsequent to forfeiture pursuant to clause 14.
Subsection 2 of clause 11 provides for the
publication in the Canada Gazette in advance
of enactment of every amendment to a regulation made pursuant to paragraphs (a) and
(b) of subsection 1, which are the paragraphs
dealing with classes of devices and standards
applicable to those classes. The clause also
provides that reasonable opportunity be given
to manufacturers and others to make representations to the minister respecting any such
proposed amendment. It is this subsection,
among others, upon which reliance is placed
for providing to the industry adequate notice
of proposed changes in standards.
The penalty clause has been divided into
two parts, the first of which relates to
offences against clause 5. The second part
refers to offences against clauses other than
clause 5. This division has been made for the
purpose of placing emphasis on the view that
the activity described in clause 5, the manufacture and distribution, is regarded as the
most serious offence relating to radiation
emitting devices and the fact that a violation
of clause 5 would in many instances be committed by manufacturers of substantial means
and in circumstances where rather severe
penalties might be the only effective deterrent. On the other hand, there are other
offences which may be committed by persons
of less substance, where less severe penalties
would be equally effective. In both cases,
however, provision bas been made for procedure either by way of summary conviction or
by way of indictment.
The design of the whole clause, therefore, is
considered to be useful in that it gives fiexibility to a court which will be in the best
position to judge the circumstances and the
merits of each case and further flexibility to
persons acting as agent of the Crown in
instituting prosecution proceedings.
Clause 13 contains somewhat standard
provisions in legislation of this kind. Subclause 1 contains the usual provision under
which an employer may not escape responsibility for violation of the legislation on the
basis that that violation was committed by a
21498-27J

person employed by him. The only time he
can escape such responsibility is when he can
show that the offence was committed without
his knowledge and that he was diligent in
trying to prevent its commission.
Subclause 1 of clause 14 gives authority to
a court to order forfeiture to the Crown of
any device in relation to which a person bas
been convicted of a violation. Such provision
is essential to take care of a situation where
upon conviction the person found guilty
might disclaim responsibility for the equipment that forms the subject matter of the
offence, and where forfeiture would then perhaps become the only means of preventing
hazard to the public through its subsequent
use without modification.
Subclause 2 of clause 14 provides machinery by which persons interested by title or
financial interest in equipment that has been
forfeited under clause 14 may make representation for the restoration to them of the
equipment, or with a view to protecting their
interest in it. Rather than repeat in the act
the lengthy provisions for this purpose, the
procedure set out in section 64A of the Fisheries Act has been invoked, as it bas been in
some other acts, and made applicable mutatis
mutandis to equipment forfeited under the
Radiation Emitting Devices Act.
I have with me a copy of section 64A of the
Fisheries Act, and as the hour is late, rather
than reading it into the record I wonder if
honourable senators would give me permission to have it printed in the record.

Hon. Mrs. Ferguason: Because of the necessity in instances of this kind to commence
administering the act only after the act has
been supplemented by the setting of basic
standards and other regulations, it is expedient to bring the act into effect only upon
proclamation in order that such regulations as
are necessary may be enacted with effect as
of the same date. This is provided for in
clause 11.
If this bill receives second reading tonight, I
propose to move that it be referred to the
Standing Senate Committee on Health, Welfare and Science for further study.

"prescribed substances" means uranium, thorium, plutonium, neptunium,

energy.

CONSTITUTION OF CANADA
PROPOSED JOINT COMMITTEE-DEBATE
ADJOURNED

The Hon. the Speaker informed the Senate
that a message had been received from the
House of Commons requesting the Senate to
unite with that house in the formation of a
joint committee of both houses to examine
and report upon proposals on a number of
subjects related to the Constitution of
Canada.
Hon. Paul Martin: Honourable senators, I
move, with leave of the Senate, and bearing
in mind Rule 44(l)(d), the following motion:
That the Senate do unite with the
House of Commons in the appointment of
a Special Joint Committee of both Houses
to examine and report upon proposals,
made public, or which are from time to
time made public by the Government of
Canada, on a number of subjects related
to the Constitution of Canada during the
course of the comprehensive review of
the Constitution of Canada, which review
was agreed upon at the Constitutional
Conference of the Prime Minister of
Canada and the Premiers and Prime
Ministers of the Provinces in February,
1968, and alternative proposals on the
same subjects;
That the following senators be appointed to act on behalf of the Senate on the
Special Joint Committee, namely, the
honourable Senators Connolly (Ottawa
West), Cook, Flynn, Giguère, Grosart,
Lamontagne, Lang, Macdonald (Cape
Breton), McDonald, Phillips (Rigaud).
That the committee have power to
appoint, from among its members, such
subcommittees as it may deem advisable
or necessary;
That the committee have power to sit
during sittings and adjournments of the
Senate;
That the committee have power to
report from time to time, to send for
persons, papers and records, and to print

January 28, 1970

such papers and evidence from day to
day as may be ordered by the committee;
That the committee have power to
adjourn from place to place within
Canada; and
That a message be sent to the House of
Commons to inform that House accordingly.
Honourable senators, the Parliament of
Canada has had on a number of occasions
during its lifetime to study, either conjointly
through the two houses or in one of its
houses, matters affecting the Constitution of
our country. Our Constitution is not a completely written document. Nevertheless, that
portion of the Constitution and other additions to it, by way of the law of custom or by
special acts, have been considered from time
to time by various parliamentary bodies.
I believe the last time the Constitution was
considered in a major way was in the constitutional committee set up by Parliament in
1935. Since that time, of course, it has been
considered at federal-provincial conferences.
There was one major royal commission, the
Rowell-Sirois Commission, whose report culminated in the conference of 1941. As early
as 1967, the provincial governments served
notice on the federal Government of their
desire to engage in discussions of a constitutional character. This began with a conference
called in Toronto by Premier Robarts, but at
which the federal Government was not represented.
Subsequently, in February 1968, the provinces met with the federal Government, in
Ottawa, when a decision was made to undertake a global review of the Constitution. At
that first conference in 1968 it was agreed to
examine the official languages problem, fundamental rights, the distribution of powers,
regional disparity, constitutional amendment
procedures, and other matters. It is interesting to note the text in French.
[Translation]
Among the conclusions of the conference
which took place in February 1968, it was
decided that the Constitutional Conference and
the Committee of Officials would study the
following subjects: official languages, fundamental rights, distribution of powers, reform
of institutions linked with federalism, among
which the Senate and the Supreme Court of
Canada, regional disparities, amending pro-

provinces should have the right to name certain judges to the Supreme Court of Canada?
These are some of the questions that are
bound to be covered by the joint parliamentary committee proposed by the Prime Minister. His views were stated the day before
yesterday in the debate which took place in
the other house, when it was unanimously
decided to accept the proposition be put
forward.
So I believe that this Senate-with its long
record of achievement, its knowledge of the
institutions of Parliament and the responsibilities of the various levels of Government,
and its awareness of the problems that divide
us at the present time, as well as the circumstances that strengthen this nation-has an
opportunity to use its experience and to reach
judgments with regard to these matters, the
subject of discussion and negotiation between
the federal Government and the provinces,
particularly since 1968.
At the present time I can conceive of no
more useful function in which we could be
engaged, in the national interest, than participating with the members of the other
house in the fullest consideration of the tentative positions taken by the federal Government thus far in recent constitutional discussions, and in giving study to alternative
proposals to matters that have not yet been
discussed in a federal-provincial conference.
The question of the repatriation of the Constitution has not been the subject matter of
discussion between the federal and provincial
governments in recent conferences. It has
been the subject of discussion over the years
by the Canadian Parliament and by royal
commissions. It has won the support of certain governments. This is certainly one of the
questions we will want to consider. Has the
time come when there should be an agreed
formula that would enable us, within the precincts of our own legal arrangements, to provide for finality in respect of constitutional
matters? How long will we have to rely on a
jurisdiction outside this country?
In any event, honourable senators, these are
some of the matters that this proposed joint
committee will consider. I strongly recommend this motion to all honourable senators.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Flynn, debate

PETITION FOR BILL TO ANNUL RESOLUTION-

REPORT OF COMMITTEE ADOPTED
Hon. Jacques Flynn: Honourable senators, I
present the report of the Standing Senate
Committee on Legal and Constitutional
Affairs to which was referred the petition of
Roberte Bérubé Gingras, of the City of
Montreal.
The report was read by the ClerIc Assistant
as follows:
The Standing Senate Committee on
Legal and Constitutional Affairs to which
was referred the petition of Roberte
Berube Gingras, of the city of Montreal,
in the province of Quebec, praying for
the passing of an Act to annul Resolution
numbered 591, adopted by the Senate on
27th June, 1969, dissolving the marriage
between the said Roberte Berube Gingras
and Andre Gingras, which petition and a
draft bill based thereon were filed with
the Clerk of the Parliaments on 25th
July, 1969, in accordance with subsection
(2) of section 2 of an Act authorizing the
Senate of Canada to Dissolve and
Annul Marriages, chapter 10 of the statutes of 1963, has in obedience to the
order of reference of 25th November,
1969, examined the said petition and now
reports as follows:
1. The Committee finds that the petitioner failed to comply with the statutory provisions of section 2 of an Act
authorizing the Senate of Canada to
Dissolve and Annul Marriages, chapter
10 of the statutes of 1963, in that she
did not file a new petition and a draft
bill, to the same effect as those originally filed, with the Clerk of the Parliaments within thirty days of the
commencement of the present session
of Parliament, as required by subsec-

January 28, 1970

SENATE DEBATES

tion (4) of the said section, which subsection reads as follows:
(4) Where a petition or a bill seeking
the annulment or modification of a
resolution of the Senate dissolving
or annulling a marriage has been
disposed of by reason of prorogation or dissolution of Parliament,
and a new petition and a draft bill
to the same effect are not filed with
the Clerk of the Parliaments within
thirty days of the commencement of
the next ensuing session of Parliament, such resolution shal come into
force on the expiration of such thirty
days. If such petition and draft bill
are so filed within such thirty days,
the operation of such resolution shall
be suspended in accordance with the
provisions of subsection (2).
2. The first Session of the 28th Parliament prorogued on October 22, 1969,
and the present session, the second session of the 28th Parliament, commenced on October 23, 1969. No new
petition and draft bill based thereon
were filed by the petitioner with the
Clerk of the Parliaments prior to the
expiration of thirty days following the
commencement of the present session.
3. The Committee accordingly finds
that the petition filed with the Clerk of
Parliaments on 25 July, 1969, is ineffective and that it should not be proceeded with further.
4. The Committee recommends that an
over-payment of the Parliamentary
fees in the amount of $60.00 be refunded to the petitioner's Ottawa
agent.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, when shall this report be taken into
consideration?
Hon. Mr. Flynn: With leave, I move adoption of the report now. There may be an
explanation by the chairman of the subcommittee which studied the matter, Senator
Phillips (Rigaud).
Hon. Lazarus Phillips: Honourable senators,
the report which has just been filed by Senator Flynn as Acting Chairman of the Standing
Senate Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs is self-explanatory. I need only supplement it by the observation that the subcommittee of the standing committee met
and I had the honour of being appointed
chairman of the subcommittee.
21498-28

The subcommittee studied the petition and
the law related to the subject matter. In this
respect we had the advantage and opportunity of consulting the officers of the Senate who
are versed in these matters. After very careful consideration of the subject matter, notwithstanding the fact that one is inclined to
deal with substance rather than form when
petitions are presented to honourable senators, it was felt that as a matter of law there
was simply no way, having regard to the
provisions of law referred to in the report
submitted by the honourable Senator Flynn,
which would enable the subcommittee to deal
with the subject matter. The law was
reviewed by the members of the subcommittee as individual members and as a committee. The officers of the Senate knowledgeable
in these matters were consulted and the pertinent sections of the law referred to in the
report were dealt with.
After careful and detailed consideration the
subcommittee of the Standing Senate Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs
came to the conclusion that the petition as
presented simply was not properly before this
bouse and was not properly before the Standing Senate Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs and in the process not
properly before the subcommittee. Under the
circumstances I had the honour of filing the
report of the committee arriving at such
legal conclusions. This report is now reflected
in the report that Senator Flynn has been
good enough to submit to this bouse as Acting Chairman of the Standing Senate Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs.
Hon. Mr. Choquette: Honourable senators, I
wish to ask a question. As a practising solicitor, I am always sorry to see a petitioner or a
plaintiff in any type of action deprived of his
or ber rights because of a technicality or a
procedural requirement.
I wonder if in this case the petitioner or
those persons who have lost their rights were
advised by the officers. Senator Phillips
(Rigaud) has just told us that he had the
benefit of the advice of the officers working in
the Senate. Did these officers warn the petitioner's solicitor, or solicitors, that they would
lose their rights if they did not do certain
things within a certain time? If there was
such a disregard on the part of the solicitor
or the client, then I understand that these
people would be deprived of their rights. Are
you in a position to tell us whether that
procedure was followed?

SENATE DEBATES
Hon. Mr. Phillips (Rigaud): I am in a position to reply to that question as follows.
I am advised that an officer of the Crown
dealing with the subject matter did not warn
the petitioner of the necessity of filing a new
petition within 30 days after the commencement of the next ensuing session, as referred
to in the report. On the other hand, the subcommittee was informed that it is the duty of
counsel for petitioners on their own account
to be seized of the law in the matter, and that
it is not the responsibility of officers of the
Senate to advise petitioners and their counsel
on these procedural matters.
I may say further, although the question
has not been put to me by Senator Choquette,
that the subcommittee was advised that
although the petition as filed could not be
dealt with for the reasons already given,
there is nothing in the law that would prevent the petitioner from proceeding to the
high court of Parliament if she desires the
reconsideration of a new petition.
Report adopted.

MANITOBA CENTENNIAL YEAR
INVITATION TO PARTICIPATE IN FESTIVITIES

Hon. J. Campbell Haig: Honourable senators, I wish to draw to the attention of this
honourable house the fact that in the keystone province of our country we are celebrating our centennial year. This program has
been instituted for quite some time, and we
are now entering into large scale activity.

January 28, 1970

SENATE DEBATES

The City of Ottawa bas deemed fit and
proper to declare this day as "Manitoba Day"
in our nation's capital. As part of the celebrations of this day here in the Centennial Hall
the Royal Winnipeg Ballet is presenting a
new ballet called "Five over Thirteen". What
that means, I do not know. Honourable senators will have to attend the performance and
find out what it means.
In about five or six weeks the Dominion
Curling Championship, known as the MacDonald Briar, is to be held in Winnipeg. There
are many different and varied activities
taking place throughout the province during
the year, both sporting and cultural.
In our sister city we will have the St. Boniface Winter Festival. Some honourable senators may have noticed at the luncheon today a
gentleman in a red jacket and a red toque. He
was representing the St. Boniface Winter Festival, which takes place in a couple of weeks.
We will also be privileged to have the
Queen, Prince Philip and their children visit
our city sometime in early July.
I extend a cordial invitation to honourable
senators, their wives and friends to come and
visit our province this year to see the growth
and vitality of our keystone province.
Hon. Paul Martin: Honourable senators, I
am sure all of us want to join in congratulating the people of Manitoba on the
occasion of the centenary of that province. In
doing so we congratulate ourselves, because
we belong to a country composed of ten provinces, of which Manitoba is one of those, that
have added to the lustre of our country.
The Government of Canada has sought to
assist in the celebrations marking this centennial by a substantial financial contribution to
some of the expenditures inevitably involved
in these celebrations. This announcement by
honourable Senator Haig affords us the
opportunity not only to congratulate Manitoba but to say that this centennial event will
give us all the further opportunity to appreciate the value of the constituent elements of
our country that go to make up this nationconstituent
elements in themselves
so
endowed that they will cause the majority of
Canadian citizens to recognize the value of
maintaining the unity of this country. I may
say I am going to mark the centennial myself
by going to the Royal Winnipeg Ballet
tonight.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: On the stage?
21498-28J

Hon. Mr. Martin: I hope the honourable
leader opposite will be there.
Hon. Jacques Flynn: Honourable senators,
there will be another occasion upon which we
can speak about this very important event.
The only comment I want to make today
about Manitoba joining Confederation one
hundred years ago is that it was at that time
that Canada acquired a new dimension.
Hopefully, another occasion will present itself
when we can deal more fully with this very
important centennial.
RADIATION EMITTING DEVICES BILL
SECOND READING

The Senate resumed from yesterday the
adjourned debate on the motion of Hon. Mrs.
Fergusson for the second reading of Bill S-14,
respecting the sale and importation of certain
radiation emitting devices.
Hon. Edgar Fournier: Honourable senators,
when I rose to adjourn the debate last night I
must admit that I was caught a little by surprise. I was not aware that someone else had
been designated to do so, but I did not want
the bill to be passed without some further
explanation-flying like a kite without a
purpose.
I also wanted to compliment very sincerely
Senator Fergusson for sponsoring this bill,
which is highly technical in nature. I am sure
that very few honourable senators have any
information or knowledge about radiation
emitting devices, except perhaps those in the
medical profession.
I will put my questions very briefly. Is
there at the moment any need for such a bill
as this and, if so, why? Do we have in
Canada people who are in the business of
selling radiation emitting devices? If so, could
we have the names of a few of them and what
they are producing? We know that in Canada
radiation emitting devices are produced, but
all these things corne under the Atomic
Energy Control Act.
One provision in this bill with which I do
not agree is the power vested in the hands of
inspectors. I am always reluctant to place too
much power into the hands of one man. If I
read the bill correctly, these appointed
inspectors could very well be what one might
call the boys in the grey fiannel suits with
a lot of authority.
Hon. Mrs. Fergusson: Would the honourable senator repeat that? I did not quite hear
his remark.

SENATE DEBATES
Hon. Mr. Fournier (Madawaska-Restigou-

che): I am talking about the power vested in
the inspectors. In this case, as in many others,
it could very well be that the inspectors will
need highly technical knowledge in this field,
and they could well be what we call the boys
in the grey flannel suits with a lot of power.
Hon. Mr. Choquette: It was the grey flannel
suit that the honourable senator missed.
Hon. Mrs. Fergusson: That is what I did not
hear.
Hon. Mr. Fournier (Madawaska-Restigouche): Under this bill the inspector will have
more power than the Royal Canadian Mounted Police or a city police chief. He will have
authority to walk into my place without a
warrant, push me out of the door, inspect my
equipment and take it out if he feels like it.
He can take away all the records, data and
information that I have gathered. I think we
should be very careful before vesting so much
power in the hands of inspectors. I do not
have the answer to this, but I hope that those
who follow me during the debate will be able
to enlighten the house on these matters.
Hon. Allister Grosari: Honourable senators,
I am quite sure Senator Fournier need not
have apologized for his expressed eagerness
to rise and compliment Senator Fergusson on
her excellent presentation of this bill. I
myself alrnost got up ah ead of him in my
eagerness for the same reason. Certainly
Senator Fergusson is to be complimented on
her excellent exposition of a very difficult
bill. Obviously she did her homework, as she
always does. For that reason, we can assume
two major propositions stated by Senator Fergusson and referred to by Senator Fournier.
First, there is a noed for this bill. Secondly, it
is a bill which bas good intentions, namely,
the protection of the public.

January 28, 1970

gusson's word as to the need for this bill, but
I would like to have some evidence. Reiterating the questions which Senator Fournier
raised, has there been abuse? Is there equipment today endangering lives of Canadians?
Are there dangerous substances in the hands
of various people at this moment? If so, in
whose hands? If so, to what uses are they
being put? Who is being endangered? Are
these substances that are putting them in
danger in the hands of children? Are they in
the hands of quacks?
Honourable senators, we have the bill
before us, but we have no information whatsoever
as
to
the
current
situation
that the honourable senator and the officials
and the department regard as justifying the
bill. I am not suggesting for one moment that
the bill cannot be justified. I am fully aware
that its main intention is to close a gap left
between the provisions of two bills, the Hazardous Products Bill, which we had before us
not very long ago, which deals with hazardous substances and equipment put to
household use, and the Atomic Energy Control Act, which deals with hazards arising
from such substances as uranium, thorium,
plutonium, neptunium, deuterium, and that
whole family. There is a gap, no question
about that.
Honourable senators, when the Senate is
asked to consider a bill such as this, we
should he told not merely that there is a gap,
but what are the problems in the gap and
what we are dealing with. It is true perhaps
that Senator Fergusson-if I may use a
phrase which will evoke fond memories
here-has given the "classes" of substances
and equipment which come under this billbut she has not given us the "kinds". It is not
a question of class or kind; it is a question of
our wanting to know the class and the
"kind".

Hon. Mr. Flynn: That brings back fond
Hon. Mr. Flynn: All bills have good intenmemories.
tions. We have to presume that.

Hon. Mr. Grosari: As the Leader of the
Opposition says, we always need to be a little
suspicious of government bills with good
intentions because, as I may be able to
demonstrate in this case, good intentions
often run away with the drafting of the bill. I
believe this has happened in this case.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: Agreed.
Hon. Mr. Grosari: Like Senator Fournier, I
would be quite prepared to take Senator Fer[Hon. Mrs. Fergusson.]

Hon. Mr. Grosari: The Leader of the Oppo-

sition says this brings back memories.
Hon. Mr. Martin: The Leader of the Oppo-

sition bas been interrupting your speech quite
often today.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: He can stand it.
Hon. Mr. Grosar: I may say, with some

regret, that the interruptions from my own
leader are never quite as helpful as those I
get from the leader on the other side.

January 28, 1970

SENATE DEBATES

Hon. Mr. Martin: We are always willing to
help you on this side.
Hon. Mr. Grosart: There is a rather fundamental question of principle here. The bill
says, in effect, that the area described in very
technical language, this area of "substances
which emit electromagnetic radiation generated by electric currents and which utilize electromagnetic radiation for their effect," is the
general area in which we are dealing. But it
must be obvious that the bill is not aimed at
every substance and every piece of equipment
in this wide field.
Hon. Mr. Sullivan: Nor is that in the bill.
Hon. Mr. Grosart: Yes, as Senator Sullivan
says, that is not in the bill. That is the point I
wish to make; that is the principle of which I
am speaking. The principle is that this
omnibus authority is given-to the officials, in
the long run-to prescribe certain of these
substances and certain equipment. We do not
know what they intend to prescribe. Therefore we do not really know what the substance of this bill is.
It will be replied, of course, that we will
have all this information when we see the
regulations of the order in council under this
bill. That is quite true. When we see those
regulations we will know what this bill is
about. I submit that until we do, we do not
know what we are dealing with, we do not
know what this bill is about except in this
very large "class". What specific "kinds" of
things will be brought under this very strict
control we do not know. I respectfully suggest
to honourable senators that before we pass
this bill we should insist on knowing. How
can we know? Perhaps in committee? Perhaps in committee we should tell the officials
that we will not pass this bill until they show
us the regulations, since it is only when they
produce the regulations that we will know
what power they are asking us to give. We
can assume they are not asking for complete
power over every substance and every piece
of equipment in this area. They are asking
for power over certain specific ones, but they
have not told us which ones, what kinds,
what groups they fall into.
Senator Fergusson did suggest a broad
category when she spoke of "hazards of
patients in the case of medical X-rays and to
industrial workers and scientists in cases
where adequate care has not been taken in
the design and construction of equipment."

Is this the only area to which these regulations will apply? Will they go beyond this?
Are we to assume that this narrow field
described by the sponsor is a total description
of the area of the bill, and that it is exclusive
of others? Or are the officials in the position
of arbitrarily making the decisions as to what
actually is prescribed?
Honourable senators, the point I am making
is that, if we pass this bill as it stands, we are
saying to the officials: "You decide what the
substance of this bill is, we will pass it and
you tell us some time later what we passed."
This is not the only bill we have had before
us in which this principle has been involved.
Honourable senators will recall some recent
bills such as the Deposit Insurance Corporation Bill, which is now an act. In that case we
were asked to pass the bill and leave it to the
officials to define the word "deposit". I see the
honourable senator, the chairman of the
Banking, Trade and Commerce Committee
which dealt with it, smiling. I intend to refer to
him in a moment. I suggest that this bill in
committee be given the same treatment as the
chairman of the Standing Senate Committee
on Banking, Trade and Commerce, gave the
Deposit Insurance Corporation Act. He
applied what I call the Hayden formula. In
that case he told the Government it would be
allowed some time-I have forgotten the
period which was finally decided on. Was it a
year?
Hon. Mr. Flynn: Two years?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: Either a year or 18
months.
Hon. Mr. Grosari: Anyway, the Hayden
formula required the officials to come back
within a given period of time to define the
word "deposit," otherwise the bill lapsed. The
principle is exactly the same here, for this
chamber was saying, "We will not give you
unlimited power. Come back and define the
substance and we will decide whether you
can carry on with your duties under the bill."
I suggest that might be a very sound principle for this chamber to adopt in all such bills,
because, as Senator Fournier (MadawaskaRestigouche) said, this kind of bill gives
extraordinary powers to officials. I am not
greatly concerned that they are given the
powers to enter, to examine and copy documents, and to seize the equipment in certain cases. I think that is necessary for the
implementation of certain acts. However, as a
layman I have always wondered why a writ

SENATE DEBATES

of entry was not required. It is required in
much less important matters. It seems to me a
very sensible thing to require the officials to
go before a judge or justice of the peace and
convince him that they have good cause to be
concerned and good reasons to make a sudden
entry, as this bill contemplates.
Hon. Mr. Martin: If my honourable friend
were to ask that question in committee, perhaps he would find that if this requirement
were provided for it would be good
notice to the person against whom this bill is
designed to act. Undoubtedly, we would all
prefer the inspectors to have warrants and
rights under the courts to carry out their
duties, but I think when you examine the
witnesses you will find that there is a very
good reason for doing it this way, namely,
that they could not possibly discharge their
functions, if they had to go to a court every
time.
Hon. Mr. Grosari: It is difficult at the
moment to reply to this rather unusual interjection by the Leader of the Government. I
am not sure whether he was asking a question, teaching me some law or making a
speech.
Hon. Mr. Martin: Someone says, "all three,"
but I had no such intention in mind.
Hon. Mr. Flynn:
though.

But you are

capable,

Hon. Mr. Grosari: I agree that the Leader
of the Government is capable of doing all
three, and at greater length than in his latest
interruption. But that is not the point at all.
Of course the officials will come back and tell
us why they do not want to go through the
business of having a warrant. It seems to me
that this would be the kind of observation I
would expect to hear from the officials rather
than from the Leader of the Government. But
this does not go to the heart of my objection.
I say that where these great powers are given
we have additional reason to examine very
carefully the powers we grant under this bill
and the kinds of equipment and substances to
come under it after we pass this omnibus bill.
I referred to the Hazardous Products Bill
which went so far as to give the minister the
power of repealing the bill, because there
were two schedules and he was given the
power to transfer products from one to the
other and to delete products from one
schedule or the other so that he could have
deleted everything from both schedules and
[Hon. Mr. Grosart.]

January 28, 1970

the act would have been repealed. That is
still on the statute books. Some of us were
not able to convince the chamber that we
should not pass a bill of that kind.
Now, the Hazardous Products Bill is quite
analogous to this one in that it deals with the
same kinds of hazard, albeit in another
area-the household area. But even the Hazardous Products Bill had schedules which at
least gave us a clue to the kinds of hazardous
products with which it was intended to deal.
We have no such clue in this bill.
I would say in conclusion, honourable senators, that in committee I hope we require the
officials at least to describe the regulations
they intend to put into effect, if we give them
this authority. I should like to see it become a
principle in this chamber that in this kind of
bill we will not grant this wide authority at
any time unless we see the regulations.
Surely it makes sense for a legislative chamber to say it wants to see the results of what
it is being asked to do.
Hon. Joseph A. Sullivan: Honourable senators, I do not intend to make a speech. I am
just going to make a few comments. I should
like to congratulate the sponsor of the bill
and tell her I agree with her completely. I
disagree with the remarks of my two colleagues, Senator Grosart and Senator Fournier (Madawaska-Restigouche). It is a truly
worthwhile piece of legislation which I think
should have been introduced long ago.
I wish to ask one question before I make
my few remarks. Has this bill anything to do
with colour television? Whether it has or has
not, it should. About a year and a half ago
Senator Louis Gélinas spoke to me when the
matter of colour television had been completely investigated in the United States. The
results of that investigation are now fully
known, and my advice to all senators who
own colour television sets is that they should
not sit closer than ten feet and they should
wear rubber aprons.
Senator Fergusson mentioned the laser
light. That is a most technical piece of equipment. We would never need to worry about
any inferior quality of laser coming into this
country. It is too precisely and accurately
made. It is made to be used under microscopic
instrumentation and is always experimentally
utilized on animals before being applied to
humans.
Now, a parallel can be drawn between this
bill and the drug bill in terms of importation

January 28, 1970

SENATE DEBATES

of goods of inferior quality. When I spoke on
the drug bill I mentioned the inferior quality
of drugs that might come into this country
under foreign labels at cheaper prices. Such
drugs could be put out by companies in
Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Poland and Italy at
lower prices but of inferior quality. The same
principle applies to this legislation. What it is
striving to do is protect the consumer from an
inferior quality of infra-red lamp machine
used by physiotherapists and from inferior
quality X-ray machines that are loaned out to
institutions. Such machines may be of second
degree and may have been utilized and then
not properly checked.
I am not in a position to comment on the
legal aspects of the bill, and the power of
control and so on, but I do think it is a worthwhile measure. I trust that when it goes to
committee the very important questions that
Senator Grosart raised will be answered.
Thank you.
Hon. Muriel McQ. Fergusson: Honourable
senators,The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, I must inform you that if the honourable
Senator Fergusson speaks now it will have
the effect of closing the debate.
Hon. Mrs. Fergusson: Honourable senators,
perhaps, owing to the late hour last evening, I
did not elaborate as much as I might have on
the devices expected to be covered by this
legislation. These devices are X-ray machines,
microwave ovens and similar appliances, and
laser equipment. It is not thought, I am sure,
that anyone deliberately manufactures these
in a way that they will be harmful.
However, it has been found by surveys in
Washington, and I am sure in other places, that
much of this type of equipment is not sufficiently safe. It does not adequately ensure
that radiation does not leak from it and is
therefore dangerous to the patient who might
be getting more radiation than he should and
to the operator who should be getting none at
all. I am sure more information on this aspect
of the situation will be made available by
officials of the department at the time they
appear before the committee when the bill is
receiving further study there. There are many
dangers associated with this emission of
radiation when it is not adequately controlled.
The marked increase in the incidence of
leukemia and cancer might be traced to this,
and I understand it can result in undesirable

genetic changes. For example, with X-ray
machines, problems arise over the size of the
area to be X-rayed. If a chest X-ray is being
taken, it is possible that uncontrolled radiation could do damage to other parts of the
body. But at the present time there is no
control to ensure that in such chest X-rays
there is adequate protection for other parts of
the body. I must acknowledge that I am now
dealing with a subject of which I know very
little, and I only hope that I am reporting
accurately the information that has been
given to me. Briefiy, the purpose of the bill is
to ensure that machinery of this kind is not
imported into or sold in Canada.
Recently legislation has been passed in the
United States-it was called the Electronics
Bill, I believe-to ensure that adequate controls would exist in that country. That legislation was introduced there shortly after
these surveys in Washington of which I have
just spoken. However, that legislation will
control only devices to be used in the United
States. If it were found that such machinery
was emitting dangerous radiation it could not
be used there. However, there is nothing to
prevent its being exported to Canada and this
could readily happen if we do not have adequate controls to prevent its use here. People
who are familiar with these matters feel that
this is a situation which should be remedied.
Mention has been made of the Atomic
Energy Control Board, but the legislation
proposed does not cover articles coming under
the control of that board. Furthermore, I am
given to understand that the Atomic Energy
Control Board supports the concept of the
proposed legislation for the reasons I have
given.
If I may, honourable senators, I should
now like to deal with some of the specific
questions that were asked concerning this
legislation. Senator Fournier (MadawaskaRestigouche) asked if we have need of
such a bill. I believe that in the interests
of public health such a bill is absolutely
necessary. As we all know, excessive radiation can cause or aggravate illness. Senator
Fournier asked if we have sellers in Canada.
I believe we have but I cannot say so
with certainty. Here again the departmental
officials appearing before the committee will
be able to give us some information. A further question was asked about the "men in
the grey flannel suits". I do not feel there is
any need for worry on this score because I
understand the same inspectors will be used
as are now being used by the Atomic Energy

they are attached to this particular department, they investigate for the Atomic Energy

Emitting Devices Bill when it becomes law.
As I have said, they are highly-trained
people. I remember in the course of the
debate on the Hazardous Products Act questions were asked as to whether that act would
necessitate the setting up of a new department of inspectors. I was assured at that time
that the system we now have would be capable of taking care of any extra investigation
duties arising because of this legislation. I am

SENATE DEBATES

I can assure you that it was a very pathetic
aspect of our trip when we arrived at Sheerwater to meet these families in mourning,
offer them our condolences and witness rather
sad scenes aboard the aircraft during the
flight from Sheerwater to London.
After the first leg of our trip, we took a
commercial flight from London to New Delhi.
I would be remiss if, at the bginning of my
remarks, I failed to men:ion the warm hospitality extended to us by officials of the Indian
government and Indian delegates at the InterParliamentary Conference. Our Indian friends
really went all out to make our stay as comfortable and enjoyable as possible.
The conference opened at 1 o'clock, October 30, in the Lok Sabha, the hall where the
National Assembly of India holds its sittings.
The opening session was preceded by a
procession of dignitaries in full regalia, in
keeping with the age-old traditions of this
country which is thousands of years old. In
this pomp, this display, this procession, I
think I noticed something of the British traditions. India seems to have kept the traditions
under which she lived for three centuries, the
British traditions. I recalled or was told during a tour of India-I think it was an Indian
dignitary who had said to an English representative-that there was only one British
country left in the world and that was India.
He was referring to the British traditions
which India has maintained to this day.
I was that much more impressed by the
pageant-like arrival of the dignitaries at the
National Assembly because the week before I
had had the honour and pleasure to attend the
opening of the British Parliament in London.
It had been difficult for Her Majesty's
retinue to get to the parliament buildings
in London that morning as very heavy traffic
was slowing down the procession, since the
opening of Parliament coincided with the tube
strike which had resulted in heavier surface
traffic than usual. While in India I was able,
thanks to this prior event, to recall the display that generally accompanies such functions in England, as the following week I
could watch in New Delhi the very same
spectacle I had witnessed in London.
Once the dignitaries had entered the Lok
Sabha debating chamber as silver trumpets
blared out, there were opening speeches. The
President of India, His Excellence Shri V Giri
spoke first; with him were Mrs. Gandhi, the

Prime Minister, Dr. G. S. Dhillon, Speaker of
the Lok Sabha, and Mr. André Chandernagor,
the president of the Interparliamentary
Union. The dignitaries welcomed us and
expressed their best wishes for the success of
our conference.
The conference proper opened in the afternoon of the same day, at 2.30, in the Vigeyan
Bhavan Building-or the House of the People-where approximately 500 delegates to
the conference met to listen to Mrs. Gandhi
who was to welcome us to her country and
then speak about international problems and
those of her own country.
Following Mrs. Gandhi's speech, the General Assembly launched a discussion on the
report of the Secretary General of the InterParliamentary Union. This report of the
Secretary General is no more nor less the
equivalent of our Speech from the Throne. It
is a review of the world situation, a personal
review prepared by the Secretary General, in
the performance of the duties of the InterParliamentary Union Council, stating his
views on the international situation as he
sees it.
The first speeches dealt with the report of
the Secretary General. Then, the conference
was divided into commissions; the first was on
Political Matters, Disarmament and International Security, followed by the Parliamentary and Judicial Commission, the Economic
and Social Commission, the Educational,
Scientific and Cultural Commission and, finally, the Commission on Non-Autonomous Territories and Ethnic Questions.
The Secretary-General wished, first of all,
to point out that the conference was being
held in New Delhi to celebrate the 100th
birthday of Mahatma Gandhi, and a resolution to that effect was adopted. It reads as

The 57th Inter-Parliamentary Conference, meeting in New Delhi in the year of
Mahatma Gandhi's centenary, renders respectful homage to the memory of Mahatma Gandhi, an apostle of peace, who believed in the equality and fraternity of
all men, who had faith in truth and nonviolence as means of solving national and
international conflicts, who awakened the
national conscience of his people and obtained the independence of his country
through the application of the principles
he believed in.
Later on, the chairman of the conference,
Dr. G. S. Dhillon, submitted, jointly with the

SENATE DEBATES

Secretary General, Mr. André de Blonay, a
report to the President of the Council of the
Inter-Parliamentary
Union,
dated from
Geneva, Dec. 6, 1969, in which he said:
Mr. President:
In accordance with section 8 of the
Inter-Parliamentary Rules and Regulations, we have the honour to bring to
your attention the resolutions passed by
the 57th Inter-Parliamentary Conference,
held at New Delhi from October 30 to
November 7, 1969, as well as the results
of the elections and nominations held at
the same time.
We take this opportunity to remind you
of secLion 5 of the Statutes of the Union,
which reads as follows: "A national
group has the duty to refer to its parliament, through its executive committee or
any individual member, the decisions of
Conferences involving parliamentary and
governmental action and to inform the
Inter-Parliamentary Bureau of the result
of the steps taken in this connection, not
later than one month before the next
Conference."
You are requested to advise your group
of these resolutions so that it may take
the action required for their implementation.
Yours faithfully,
This report is signed by G. S. Dhillon,
Chairman of the Conference and André de
Blonay, Secretary General.
Those resolutions had been introduced as
draft resolutions by the Union Executive
Council and were submitted to the various
work groups by rapporteurs who thus
launched the debate on the different
resolutions.
Here, I should stop to point out the excellent work done by the members of the
Canadian delegation in those study committees; they took part in the discussions
on the various resolutions. Among other
things, I wish to point out the job done by
our good friend Senator Fournier (Madawaska-Restigouche), who as a member of these
committees was not only useful but brilliant,
and of great help to the other delegates.
I fully support the suggestion made by the
President and the Secretary General in their
joint report to the Chairman of the InterParliamentary Union they propose that the
national groups inform their respective parliaments of the decisions made at the confer[Hon. Mr. Langlois.]

January 28, 1970

ence, and in that respect, I am sure, honourable senators, that you will not object if I
summarize the decisions which were thus
considered and amended by the study groups
at the conference held at New Delhi, and
then passed as amended by the plenary session of the conference.
The first resolution deals with the role,
responsibilities and means of small countries
for peace-keeping purposes throughout the
world and it reads as follows:
invites every national group
(a) to urge strongly their respective
Governments and Parliaments to endorse
the above-mentioned principles;
(b) to make suggestions as to practical
means by which the Union could give its
full support to the United Nations and
their agencies, particularly in their efforts
made to ensure peace and democratic
relations between nations and states;
(c) to promote in their activities the
development of regional collaboration in
order to achieve a detente and a peaceful
co-operation;

(d) to support-within the framework
of the twenty-fifth anniversary of the
United Nations-with their respective
governments, any initiative designed to
hasten the solution to world problems,
and in this context, recommend that delegations to the twenty-fifth General
Assembly be at the level of the Chiefs of
State or Governments.
This one is a very important proposition
which contains a first-rate suggestion to governments which sent delegates to the New
Delhi Conference.
The third resolution pertains to social progress as a factor and a condition to economic
expansion. The conclusions are as follows:
1. urges strongly world Parliaments to
continue their efforts in legislative and
other areas, fully aware of their basic
responsibility to promote peace in the
world and to ensure the respect of the
rule of law, and of man's fundamental
rights and freedoms as well, under conditions of freedom, dignity, economic
security and equal opportunity;
2. recommends to all Parliaments to
emphasize, among others, the importance
of the following objectives and social
policies;

a) the right for all men and women to
enjoy decent standards of living, with

conference mentioned above, and to

[Hon. Mr. Langlois.]

January 28, 1970

I insisted on reading part of some of the
resolutions because I wanted to stress their
importance and endorse the specific request
made by the New Delhi Conference and by
the Secretary General of Inter-Parliamentary
Union to all national groups, that they submit
the subject-matter of the resolutions to their
respective Parliaments and urge their colleagues to study them. I take this opportunity,
while emphasizing the importance of those
resolutions, to suggest that later on, at a sitting of the Senate or one of its committees,
the Senate Committee on External Affairs for
instance, those resolutions be considered and,
if it so decides, that a report be made to the
Government with the request that it accept
their implementation. I think that by doing
this, the national groups not only would
render a worthwhile service to the Conference and to the Secretary General of the
Inter-Parliamentary Union, but they would at
the same time render a great service to mankind, because, as we have found, those resolutions are universal in scope, since they deal
with problems now affecting the whole world.
I should like to point out, particularly to my
colleagues, the last resolution which I have
just read, that is, the recommendation concerning the protection of the human environment and the conservation of natural
resources for future generations. It is a problem of great concern, not only to Canada, but
also to all other countries. As for the conservation of the human environment, Canada
must not forget that it is also facing a very
serious problem of advanced pollution. True,
Canada has 9 per cent of the total flow of the
world's waters and only 1 per cent of the
world's total population. In spite of this enormous advantage as far as water resources are
concerned, we must realize, with dismay in
some cases, that we have a very serious pollution problem. Our largest bodies of water
and, closer to our district, the St. Lawrence
River may be the most polluted waterways in
the world at the present time. It is therefore
urgent that continuing measures be taken to
correct this if we do not want to destroy,
through lack of action, the environment in
which we live; and if we endeavour to solve
our pollution problems, it will enable us
to acquire new techniques to fight pollution,
techniques that we may be able to pass on to
other countries, in order that they may benefit from our experience in this field.
All these resolutions were passed-as I said
a moment ago-in their amended form, by
the various commissions at the conference.

January 28, 1970

SENATE DEBATES

As I say, they were passed during a general
assembly of the Conference. Again, I want to
emphasize the work done by the members of
the Canadian delegation, and to give you an
idea of your delegates' work-load at this conference, let me say, first of all, that every day
the conference met in general assembly from
10 a.m. to 1 p.m. and from 3 p.m. to 5 or 6
p.m., and the commissions also sat during the
same hours. These meetings were always
preceded by a briefing for your delegation
which began around eight o'clock in the morning and was usually held in the room of the
leader of our delegation, Mr. Grant Deachman, M.P. for Vancouver-Quadra. Furthermore
at lunch time, from one to three in the afternoon, there were other briefings. In addition
to those briefings on the spot, we attended,
before leaving Ottawa and over a period of
several days, many briefing sessions at which
officials of the Department of External Affairs
talked about the history and the living conditions of the countries to be visited, namely
India and Ceylon.
They had given us some very interesting
information about the behaviour of those
people, their system of government and their
way of living. Without such briefings, both in
Ottawa before our departure and on the
spot in India, we would not have been able to
do the work we did during this conference,
and we are very grateful to all those who
went out of their way to give us those
instructions which were very helpful.
In this respect, I would be remiss if I failed
to mention in particular the work done by
His Excellency the Ambassador, High Commissioner of Canada to India, Mr. James
George, who personally attended those briefings, along with his officials, in order to
inform us on India and its national problems,
including immigration, politcal and economic
problems. I would remind my honourable colleagues that our visit to India took place at
the time of a rather serious political problem,
when the Indian Prime Minister was thrown
out of her party by the syndicate in control
of this party in India, which resulted in an
acute polilical tension the effects of which we
could feel every day during our brief stay
there.
We also had the privilege of securing information from Canadians doing social work in
India; among others, I would point out Dr. W.
P. Hopper of Toronto, head of the Rockefeller
Foundation in India. If I remember well, he
has been in India for 14 or 15 years. He has

become a very valued adviser of the government and of the World Bank. It seems to me
nobody is more familiar than Dr. Hopper
with the economic situation of the country.
He told us about his experience over there.
He explained to us his very interesting work
and he also mentioned possible solutions to
the problems of that country.
During our stay, we also had the privilege
of meeting a man whom several of my
honourable colleagues know probably very
well, Mr. George Jackson, former Deputy
Minister of Public Works, who is now retired
and in charge of CUSO there. He retired only
a few years ago and he is performing very
interesting work in India. He gave us very
valuable information on that country.
All this goes to show how well our delegation was prepared, after such briefings to
grasp the situation in India, to better
appreciate the part played by the representatives of India at the conference, while
giving us a deeper understanding of that
highly complex country.
A moment ago, I referred to the excellent
co-operation of our ambassador, Mr. James
George. I must also emphasize a fact which
amazed me and which pleased me very much:
the perfect bilingualism of our representatives, of our Embassy staff in India; all our
agents there are thoroughly versed in our two
official languages and, therefore, can speak in
French when they meet French-speaking
people. Both in our meetings with the
embassy staff and at the receptions to which
we were invited by His Excellency, we heard
very favourable comments from the delegations of other countries who were also invited
and who were impressed with the bilingual
fluency of our embassy staff. I was told by
many representatives of other countries that
we were lucky that our officials and our
representatives were able to speak both languages. This was very important, and I think
I am right in saying that, at the conference, both languages were used and that
many delegates preferred to speak French
both at the Plenary Assembly and within the
Commissions. That is why we met more delegates speaking French than delegates speaking English as a second language, and they
were very happy to meet at our Canadian
embassy with such bilingualism, which
allowed them to use their second language in
which they were more fluent.
I must also point out the grace shown by
Mrs. George, who was a most charming and

SENATE DEBATES

pleasant hostess at receptions at the Canadian
embassy in New Delhi.
The previous speakers, and Senator Fournier (Madawaska-Restigouche) in particular,
have told us about what caught their attention most during their stay in India. First,
they were unanimous in pointing out the
utter poverty in that country. It is heart-rending really to witness such widespread and
intolerable poverty. I must say that whenever
I read in newspapers moving reports on the
problem of hunger, as a result of war, in
Biafra for instance, where the hostilities have
just ended, or in Vietnam, I wonder how it is
that our newspapers are so intensely interested in a momentary problem, due to a temporary conflict as the one in Biafra or in Vietnam-but that they forget entirely the poverty, the daily starvation in countries that are
not at war, in countries such as India, in
countries of the African or Indian sub-continent. Is it because the problem in this case is
a permament one? Is the poverty of a country
at war the only thing which matters and
which must be publicized in newspapers,
because it is only a temporary situation,
whereas permanent hunger does not make the
headlines and people forget extreme poverty
as it exists in India? Another aspect which
struck me-and previous speakers also noted
this-is the apparent inability to find worthwhile solutions to the serious problem affecting this vast country.
I realize that Canada provided extensive
assistance to India through her foreign aid
program since the inception of the Colombo
Plan, but it seems that it is not enough and
does not offer a permanent solution to the
major problem of India, the problem which I
would define as the dryness of a land lacking
water and seared by a burning sun. It would
seem to me that the major problem in India is
related to irrigation which would render the
land fertile again if it ever was.
As you know, in northern India, there is a
natural, inexhaustible supply of water coming
down the Himalayas. The eternal snows that
lie there could be melted and there may be a
true solution to the aridity of the land;
thanks to that precious resource, the land
could be made productive and capable of
feeding the hungry people of India. It came
back to my memory-I knew it before I
left, but I was able to verify it on the sitethat Canada has endorsed programs for the
building of thermonuclear plants, generating
electric power, whereas that water from the
[Hon. Mr. Langlois.]

January 28, 1970

Himalayas could be converted into electric
power and is left unused.
I also wonder-and I am not blaming the
Canadian Government in the implementation
of its foreign aid program-and my remark
could apply just as well to the government of
India-I wonder whether there is not a
tendency to give those new countries what
I should call prestige-projects, instead of
seeking real solutions to their problems.
I was quite shocked a few days ago to
see in the papers that India was considering
the possibility of developing an atomic bomb.
That country is starving; nevertheless it
will adopt a project involving prestige only,
which will probably entail expenses of hundreds of millions of dollars, to get the satisfaction of saying that India bas got the atomic
bomb and belongs to the famous world club of
atomic powers. I wonder whether we are not
taking the wrong direction. In fact, I had
discussions with the Canadian representatives.
They are well aware of the situation in India
for having lived many years in that country.
Therefore, I have come to the conclusion that
what we have done up to now seems inadequate and will not solve the problems of
India.
My colleagues and I, while proceeding
through the rural areas of India saw some
villages where poverty was so acute that I
cannot find words to describe it. I believe

that Senator Fournier succeeded in giving a
realist description of the situation when he
said that we did not even dare to get out
of our cars for fear of seeing children get

into it and tear down the inside in order to
find something to eat. This is no exaggeration; I can still sec those little fellows with a
wild and piercing look. We felt sorry for
them while wondering about their next move.
I wonder whether we have not decided, once
and for all, that the problemn of India is
beyond solution in this modern world of high
technology in every field.

How is it that in industrialized countries
like Canada and the United States we are not
able to solve a simple problem of land irrigation, while a water spring is available north
of that plateau ready to run towards the
south-west. I hope that I am right in figuring
the cardinal points, that this spring is ready
to flow towards the southwest by the law of
natural gravity to irrigate these barren lands
that need it so much.
I am also wondering if some people have
not come to the conclusion that we will have

January 28, 1970

SENATE DEBATES

to rely on the possibility of local famines such
as those that used to occur every five years,
to prevent mass destruction through a generalized famine. Moreover, we should not forget
that in India there is the problem of population explosion. Today, India's population is
527 million, or thereabouts, and it is increasing yearly in numbers equivalent to the
whole population of Canada. Taking into
account the mortality rate, it is estimated with
certainty that in year 2000, that is, in thirty
years from now, India's population will have
overshot the billion mark. If it is impossible
today to feed half that number, can you
imagine how critical things will have become
in thirty years time! Rather than a five-year
plan we should start straight away a longterm program covering thirty to fifty years
in order to help those starving people for
whom the future holds no hope.
Now-and I apologize for this diversionconsidering the most urgent problem I noticed
there, I do not pretend to be an expert in
matters pertaining to India, but I have spoken
quite genuinely and described what I believe
to be the situation, and I come back now to
the Interparliamentary Conference in New
Delhi.
I presume that some of you have a question
in mind: of what value can be a conference of
this type? Is it worthwhile for Canada to send
delegates to such a conference as that of the
Inter-Parliamentary Unions?
First, I must say in all sincerity and without any ulterior motive that at the human
level such a meeting and such an exchange
of ideas with delegates from most countries of
the world, in an informal manner but representing various classes of society from the
countries represented, have been very
enlightening. I must point out that 500 delegates from almost all the countries of the
world gathered in New Delhi-these people
were not there to offer hackneyed suggestions
or views dictated to them by their respective
governments but they represented various
elements of their country since they belong to
various political groups in their parliaments. I
think, as I said, that such an exchange of
ideas and those meetings are tremendously
valuable and enlightening and that they made
it possible for your delegates to appreciate
better the problems under consideration and
which the world must face today.
When you have this background of ideas
which reach you from Russia or elsewhere,

this background which is explained to you by
the delegates of these various countries. These
delegates are not there, I repeat, to present
ideas imposed on them by a government
before their departure, it is easier for you to
put the problem in its proper perspective and
to transpose it on the international level. This
enables you to better understand the man you
speak to and to reach, as it where, universal
understanding; you then realize how difficult
are the solutions which look rather easy at
a distance, but it is quite different when they
are presented to you by an interpreter who, I
mention it again, has no official status and
who gives you his personal impression, which
truly reflects, I am sure, the way of thinking
in the areas where they live. Now I believe
that in such circumstances, you get an
altogether different outlook on international
problems that should concern Canada and the
whole world and in which Canada will take a
greater interest in the future, for Canada, I
am sure, will have to enable her representatives to make contacts in that field in the
future so as to better realize the importance
of world problems and work towards their
solution.
It is amazing to sec to what proportions are
reduced some problems which often seem
insuperable at a distance, when they are
explained by people who experience them
and are familiar with the areas where they
crop up. It is then far easier to look into such
conditions when they are reduced to the stature of the people in the environment where
they arose.
And so, I came back from that conference
delighted, first of all, to have had the opportunity of participating in it; delighted, as
well, to have had the opportunity of working
with a delegation made up of people who
were concerned with representing Canada
properly, and who did Canada proud-all the
delegates were members of different political
parties, only one of whieh was not represented-not by putting foward the ideas of their
respective parties, or their opinions as seen
through the prism of their parties, but rather
by expressing themselves as Canadians, solely
as representatives of Canada, regardless of
their political affiliations. I was pleased to
work with such a group, and especially with
our Ambassador Mr. James George, Dr.
Hopper and Mr. Jackson, and our dedicated
secretary, Miss Jean McPherson. I must say
that the members of our delegation have the
greatest admiration for people who are as

SENATE DEBATES

dedicated as Mr. Hopper and Mr. Jackson in
bringing comfort and assistance to these destitute peoples living in the greatest misery.
These dedicated people sacrifice their own
comfort at home to go and live in foreign
countries such as India under very difficult
conditions to help the poor.
Following our visit to India, we had the
honour and pleasure to be invited by the
Ceylonese delegates to spend five days in
their country and really our visit to Ceylon
was a great revelation to the whole delegation. First, this country is a small island very
close to the southeastern coast of India,
extending over an area of barely 25,000
square miles, which is about the size of New
Brunswick; but this country has a population
of over 12 million. Comparing Ceylon with
India, there are more people in Ceylon
by square mile than in India which has a
population of 527 million. This country is an
island which has been called the Garden of
Eden and that is the impression you get when
you set foot in this country which has a marvelous vegetation and is well watered by the
India Sea and also by fresh-water springs
inland.
The visit to Ceylon, which began on our
arrival at the international airport of Colombo, lasted five days; we did not stay in
Colombo City to see the commercial activities
of the capital, but our delegation was invited
to visit the rural areas inland. We visited the
Kandy area, the historic sites of Ceylon and
especially the University of Kandy. We also
had an opportunity to get in touch with the
people, with the rural people of Ceylon. Our
impression was that the Ceylonese are industrious. People are clean and very hospitable.
They look well fed and in good health. Rural
villages are spotless clean; although people
cannot be said to be rich, their homes are
unostentatious and in line with the country's
standards. But I want to insist again on the
cleanliness of everything you see. We visited
several plantations: tea, rubber, etc. In India,
we had seen what seemed to be quite abnormal
working conditions, but these do not exist in
Ceylon, where you meet people who are quite
satisfied, open-minded and seemingly happy.
We were especially surprised by the way
we were welcomed, even in the most remote
villages. When we were crossing these small
villages in our speeding cars, we heard greetings from the crowd, little boys no higher than
my hand, small girls, shouting the name of
Canada, and who greeted us with wide smiles
showing their flashing white teeth. I men[Hon. Mr. Langlois.]

January 28, 1970

tioned this in a speech at a dinner given by
the president of the Senate in Ceylon, stating
that we had been welcomed as true friends.
Upon the last day of our stay which included
a very crowded program of official visits, we
began by calling on the Governor General,
which is astonishing in an independent country. But what astonished me even more happened when the Chief Justice of Ceylon's
Supreme Court told me something I did not
know, that they still appealed to the Privy
Council in England. That may seem unusual,
but as the Chief Justice explained to me, they
had retained the appeals to the Privy
Council in England, first, because they
were quite satisfied with their experience
with those appeals in the past. Moreover, since theirs was a young country,
with a rather heterogeneous legal system,
for Ceylon bas been at times under
the rule of the Dutch, at times under the rule
of Portugal, and then under the rule of England, their present common law comes mainly
from the Dutch law, known as The Dutch
Roman Law; and owing to the European
origin of those legal principles, the Chief Justice told me that it was one of the reasons
why they wanted to retain the appeals to the
Privy Council, and also because of the profitable experiences they had in the past with
such appeals. That reminds me of something I
have often heard judges of our highest courts
and jurists of the province of Quebec remark,
that it had been and still was a matter of
regret for them that we no longer had our
former possibility of recourse to the British
Privy Council and, what may seem surprising, primarily for the interpretation of the
Civil Code of the Province of Quebec, which
is based on the French Civil Code. As I was
saying, several of our French Canadian
jurists expressed their past and present regret
that appeals to the British Privy Council had
been abolished, because of the past favourable experiences in such recourse, particularly
for civil cases.
I apologize for this digression and I resume
the account of our last day in Ceylon. After a
visit to the Governor General, we were invited by Mr. Corea to a tour of the National
Assembly and its offices and to a reception
which was followed by another one offered by
the President of the Senate, the Honourable
Mr. Ratnayke. A luncheon was held in the
presidential suite of the Senate, at which I
had the honour of speaking in the name of
the Canadian delegation. I told our hosts how
we appreciated our stay in their country and

SENATE DEBATES

January 28, 1970

their generous hospitality. Since in the speech the assistance programs of the other countries
he made before I spoke, the Honourable Mr. in Ceylon, he said, and I quote:

WITHOUT STRINGS
The Good Samnaritan
Today there are two diametricaily opposite
approaches to the provision of aid to developing countries. There is the self-seeking and
the selfless approach.
CANADA stands out as a shining example of
the rare altruistic aristocrat who goes to the
aid of the slum dweller as though it is part of
a sacred obligation. She alone seemas to have
the right sense of giving, as though it is a
great favour conferred on her.
We feel profoundly grateful. The Government of Canada, coming to oui aid in the
hour of need, makes us almost feel that we
are receiving compensation as of right for
some injury done to us-as though they and
not the British had been oui Colonial Masters. Canada alone reassures us that to beg
we need flot be ashamed. There is no catch in
Canadian aid, no strings attached. A Nation
should merely catch the eye of the Canadians
as deserving of aid and they are there comforting you for the loss in men and property
in natural calamities like floods and cyclones
offering you immediate aid.
The Canadian Diplomat thinks and behaves
domehow, as though his country is under a
ceaseless obligation to give succour to the
distressed.
Canada is oblivious of the poitical or commercial potential of aid given to developing
nations by nations more prosperous than
herseif.
Canadian aid does not underwrite the
political fortunes of the party in power in
Ottawa.
When America cut off her aid to Ceylon
when the Govermnent dared to nationalise
the oll business, the haid-hitting communique
issued by oui Governent seemed like
slashes fromn the sword held by the Lion ini
the Ceylon National Flag. Oui reaction was
symbolic of the feelings of mrnions of Asians
and Africans, the peoples of newly emerged
independent nations, to conditional foreign
aid.

There were, of course, the prophets of
gloom in the capitals of the West and the East
who believed that oui daring reaction had
blasted Ceylon's prospects of receiving aid
fromn the western world.
But they were reckoning without the noblest
among the Powerful, Nations, the Canadians.
The stuif the Canadians are made of
stands out prominently with the realisation
that Mighty America's immediate neighbour,
had the courage to fill the breach left by the
Yanks.
The Gentlemen Diplamats
The gloom prophets were unimasked,
America was confounded, and the peoples of
Afro-Asia silently admired the newly arrived
great good Samaritan of the Far West. Ceylonese hearts warmed to the courage of a White
race in a far off place infrequently read of
and hardly ever heard over the Radio.
Without fuss and with open frankness the
High Command in Ottawa gave orders to take
over the Katunayake Air Port Development
project which had been left high and dry. It
was going to be the show-piece of Yankee aid
to Ceylon-to put Ceylon on the world's jet
map. But what a show the Canadians now
have made of it!
Canadian technicians rolled up their shirt
sleeves, the 20 mile trunk route between
Colombo and Katunayake grumbled under
the weight of heavy Canadian trucks howling
along as though in emergency transport operation in war time, and the project was completed far ahead of ail schedules. It was a
challenge to oui freedom. But we were not
without friends.
Almost overnight, Katunayake was transformed into a veritable earner of foreign
exchange for Ceylon. When the Indo-Pakistan
war broke out our Airport became the nervecentre of air traffic, jets taking off and landing in an almost never-ending stream.
The Canadian technicians put another
feather in our cap. They exploded the Coloniai myth, stili shared by brown sahibs, that

SENATE DEBATES

Ceylonese labour is lazy. Local labour was
directly recruited, cutting out "arm-chair"
contractors who devoured the lion's share of
foreign project moneys. Shiploads of machinery, equipment and trucks came directly
from Canada, leaving no room for local
sharks to grab aid money through contracts
and sub-contracts with the Canadian firm. No
wonder our labour gave of their best to the
Canadians who had nothing but praise for
Ceylonese workers. Devoid of local middlemen to exploit them, local labour went all out
to work for a friend who had come to help us
in time of need.
A nation unsullied by colonizing habits is
how the Ceylonese people have come to
describe the Canadians who seem destined to
take the stink out of the white men who
raped the resources of colonized Asia and
Africa.
The average Ceylonese is deeply gratified
to learn that Canada is the largest contributor
of outright grants to Ceylon for her economic
development. Three fourths of the Rs. 200
million of Canadian aid is an outright grant
not to be be repaid. Another Rs. 20 million
has been given us to repair the damage to
property from natural calamities.
There may be other countries willing to
come to our aid.
But it is the temperate manner in which
the Canadians went about this aid giving
business that has created for them the Asian
image of a Nation of gentlemen. Canadian
Diplomats no doubt act within a common
code the world over. For, we have yet to hear
of a hard criticism of Canadian Embassies in
Asia or Africa. Their aloofness from the
internal management of free nations is truly
a model for other nations.
Giving Graciously
Whenever floodwaters engulf our village
hamlets, destroying life and property, we
learn through a briefly worded communique
by our Government that the Canadian Envoy
has met the Prime Minister with an offer of
aid.
What a delightful contrast this is to the
fanfare of publicity which precedes aid from
certain other nations! In the latter case a
team of Diplomatic Press would have worked
overtime, DPL luxury cars would have rushed
Diplomats carrying literature to accommodate
half the space of a daily newspaper, duty-free
whiskey would flow for several days before
and after the event. The opportunity would
be exploited to throw in special articles high-

January 28, 1970

lighting the generosity of the donor country
towards all developing countries of the world.
Photographs of the leaders of the donor country and of the local Envoy, special messages
of appreciation from our own leaders would
be rushed to newsrooms as though this were
the scoop of the century.
The Canadians give as true Buddhists
would to those in need in humility rather
than ostentation.
While the construction of Katunayake Airport was under way newspapers found it difficult to persuade the Canadian Envoy to visit
the work site for the benefit of a news
photographer. A Canadian official explained:
"We are doing our bit by your country for
which we don't need any kind of publicity.
You would be doing a service if something
could be written on how the little aid we give
should be put to good use".
The philosophy of aid through trade is a
modern technique designed to take with the
left hand what the right hand gives. Developing countries at the receiving end need to
assure a trading balance in favour of the
donor country.
Alternatively there must be political gain, a
sort of dancing to pre-specified political tunes.
Nations giving aid have been hoist with their
own petard by Canada's moral norms.
Canada gracefully abjures such techniques
and we Ceylonese are profoundly grateful for
Canada's New Deal.
This country has gained a favourable trade
balance to the tune of Rs. 372 million during
six years' trading with Canada. Between 1960
and 1965 while we imported Rs. 64.7 million
worth of goods, the exports amounted to
Rs. 436.7 million (see page 16 for breakdown).
For a correct assessment of the balance of
trade, Rs. 4 million should be sliced off annually from imports statistics. This amount
represents the gifts of wheat flour and other
items channelled through the Colombo Plan
to meet natural calamities.
The Vessantara Saga
Canadian world-wide aid bas topped the
Rs. 25 billion mark, half on the never-never
and the balance on the no return basis.
Canada has played the role of good Samaritan
to two world powers with contrasting political
ideologies-Russia and Great Britain. Over a
thousand sons of Canada are showing the way
to technical progress in foreign lands. And to
silence the guns of warring states through
ceasefire and other means, Canada recently

January 28, 1970

SENATE DEBATES

gave away four million dollars to keep the
UN peace operations going in the world's
trouble spots.
What manner of men are the Canadians,
who by their acts keep reminding us of the
Vessantara Saga?
A land of contrasts, Canada is the second
largest country in the world, 3,850,000 square
miles covering the entire north of the North
American Continent with the exception of
Alaska and Greenland. But Canada is sparsely populated: a modest 19,000,000, less than
twice the population of wee Ceylon.
Canada's Resources
Canada has a Parliamentary System of
Government similar to Ceylon's. There are
two Official Languages-English and French.
Half ber population is of British stock, a
third, French, and the remainder consists of
Germans, 5.7; Ukrainians, 2.6; Dutch, 2.3;
Italians, 2.5; Scandinavians, 2.1; Poles, 1.1 per
cent. The all-Canada rate of population
growth bas been three per cent. More than
two-third live within hundred miles of the
American border. Canada leads the world in
fresh water area vital to transportation and
power generation. The St. Lawrence River
system, her main waterway, is navigable for
more than 2,000 miles. Even longer is the
Mackenzie River system stretching over 2,600
miles through the Northwest territories to the
Arctic ocean.
The poet Rudyard Kipling described
Canada as "Our Lady of the Snows". Most of
the country has a continental climate with
long, cold winters. However, summers can be
almost tropical in their intensity. Few
Canadians have seen all Canada because of
its vastness. For Canada seems several countries rolled into one, with four thousand miles
from east to west and 3,000 miles from north
to south, one and half million square miles of
forests, half a million square miles of arable
land. Southern boundaries dip down to the
latitude of Rome and Northern Islands extend

to the Polar Ice cap. Farming and Forestry
are important land resources. There are coal
and iron deposits. The seas provide the
world's richest fishing resources. A great horseshoe shaped mountains and hills covering an
area of 1,600,000 square miles covering almost
half of Canada yields much of world's nickel,
platinum, uranium, gold, silver and other
metals. Canada is the world's second largest
exporter of wheat. Canada is essentially a
forested country having more than 1,700,000
square miles under tree cover. Forest-based
industries are the most important part of the
Canadian economy and produce nearly a
third of the nation's export. The forest
industries employ nearly 3,000,000 people.
The pulp and paper industry bas grown
during the past 50 years into the country's
leading industry. Canada's Newsprint production of about 7,000,000 tons a year is more
than three times of any other country and
accounts for about 50 per cent of the world's
total production.
Canada has golden plains that sweep westward for a thousand miles and merge into a
mountainous region five hundred miles wide.
Canada is big enough to contain a wasteland
a million square miles in size and also more
lakes than any other country.
Canadians are themselves a study in contrasts. The anglo-French heritage is one of
the most important distinguishing features of
the country. The two cultures exist side by
side, each maintaining a distinct indentity,
each supplementing and contributing to the
other. Over two million immigrants have
immigrated to Canada since World War Il.
With the exploitation of its natural
resources and the growth of its industrial
economy, Canada's position as a great trading
nation and a world power has become more
and more impressive.
Yet Canada does not try to wield the big
stick at smaller nations which are struggling
to stand on their feet.

ber is concerned.

SENATE DEBATES
Cynical as it may sound, the frustrating
truth of the matter is that discussions on
matters relating to the repatriation and revision of the Constitution have become a ritual
exercise which has put to sleep those who
have little interest in the matter, while at the
same time has caused exasperation among
those who were sincerely asking for this. As a
result many have been provoked into adopting extremist attitudes. It is quie obvious
that the Government's heart has never been
in it; they have never really intended to do
anything concrete about the Constitution. For
a long time they have been content to placate
those who are outspokenly opposed to the
status quo. The Prime Minister himself said
two or three years ago that he was opposed to
a review of the Constitution, and in the
speech which he made in the other place
presenting the motion he repeated his stand. I
am wondering whether this attitude of the
Prime Minister is one of the reasons why
there was so little progress made in those
constitutional talks between the federal Government and the provinces.
In any event, let us here and now resolve,
as we set up yet another committee, that we
will not indulge in messing up the record
with a spate of trite and soporific lectures
which completely avoid the issues; that we
will not seek to make headlines with a plethora of emotional and irrational diatribes
against this or that supposed cause of our
constitutional ills. We must net allow the
record to show that this joint committee was
afflicted with a diarrhea of words when it
came to pointing out the problems and a constipation of ideas when it came to solving
them. Parliament has done precious little in
the area of constitutional reform to endear
itself to the taxpayer. He must be quite
annoyed at the money that has been spent,
with nothing of worth to show for it at this
time.
On the brighter side, permit me to point
with approval to the fact that, in setting up a
committee of Parliament to deal with the
Constitution, we will permit the general
public to participate in the revision of the
Constitution. The experience of recent years'
debates proves that this matter should not be
left to governments alone. It is obvious to me
that a set-up such as this cannot possibly do
any worse than the vehicles we have used in
the past, which ended up being driven into
the ground by the hierarchy of the East Block
and various other celestial gifts to the field of
politics.
[Hon. Mr. Flynn.]

January 29, 1970

There is definitely not a consensus of opinion on the Constitution in Canada. No great
degree of perspicacity is required to appreciate this fact. Possibly the main cause is our
dual culture. The experience of the unwritten
constitution of the Unied Kingdom suggests
to many English-speaking Canadians that we
should adopt the principle of evolution and
let the facts modify our Constitution. On the
other hand, their logic and minority status
have incited French-speaking Canadians to
claim a clear and complete document, so as to
avoid in the future those endless disputes
relating to the jurisdiction of both levels of
government.
However, let us not be intimidated by the
magnitude of the problem. We will solve
nothing by adopting a defeatist attitude and
hiding behind our problems. We must face
them squarely and hammer out the solutions.
We must be relentless in our search for just
and lasting answers to our problems.
For instance, we have yet to solve the problem-and a solution is urgently required-as
to how it would be possible for us in this
country to sign treaties which involve, in
whole or in part, implementation by provincial legislatures. We must decide whether
provincial governments should be entitled to
sign international agreements in those fields
where they have authority. The federal Government has allowed this whole matter to
devolve into an unseemly wrangle between
itself and the government of Quebec. It is
obvious that the federal Government subscribes to the theory that less mental effort is
required to fight over issues than to solve
them.
As regards air and water pollution we must
end this fatuous debate over jurisdiction. We
must finally agree upon who has authority in
any given area before we all die in our own
filth.
Again, in the field of welfare, the federal
Government's aggressive power-hungry attitude has raised the hackles of provincial leaders who feel their authority is being usurped.
The result has been conflicts between governments and personalities-confiicts which until
they are resolved will impede the progress we
should be making toward solving the crucial
problems in the field of welfare.
It is imperative if we are to reach a constitutional consensus in this land, if we are to
arrive at an arrangement in the best interests
of the country as a whole, that there be some
modification or redistribution of powers. The
powers of each level of government must be

if he ever makes up his mind to appoint new
senators, he should not forget that he will
only contribute to an already difficult situation if the appointees are selected only from
the Government party.
[Translation]
Hon. Mr. Langlois: I refrained from interrupting the Leader of the Opposition earlier,
but may I ask him a question now?
Hon. Mr. Flynn: With great pleasure.
Hon. Mr. Langlois: During his excellent
speech, the Leader of the Opposition mentioned the concept of two solitudes and I
wonder if he had in mind the theory of a
Canadian Constitution based on a two-partner
Canada, as against a Canadian Constitution
based on a ten-partner Canada advocated in
our province and proposed at last year's federal-provincial conference?
Hon. Mr. Flynn: Honourable senators, I
had not hoped that Senator Langlois would
offer me such a good opportunity of disproving an ambiguity which his party turned to
advantage in the election of 1968. As a matter of fact, we prefer using words to the
theory of two nations and we referred again
to the use of those words at the Montmorency conference and also at the Toronto convention which elected the Honourable Mr.
Stanfield as chief of the party. But I would
say that it gave the present Prime Minister a
chance to show how opportunistic he was
when he led people to believe that he was
against the two-nation theory and that we
were in favour of it. It was nothing but a
play on words.
It is probable that Senator Langlois did not
read the Montmorency resolutions, and he
probably did not read the resolutions passed
at the Toronto convention. I would also
recommend that he read another text, which
he might find interesting, and it is the article
published in the Queen's University Review
by Mr. Dalton Camp, where it wasHon. Mr. Martin: To what party does he
belong?
Hon. Mr. Flynn: Mr. Dalton Camp belongs
to the same party I do. He also was a victim
of the opportunism of the Liberal Party and
of the present Prime Minister. I remember
well that at Montmorency in particular I
did not use-because I am as much a politician as the Government Leader-these two
words, two nations, as obviously I would not
give him this unique occasion to ride these
[Hon. Mr. Flynn.]

January 29, 1970

two words, two nations, to death. But he may
have thought that these two words were in
a resolution which was merely upholding
the principle of bilingualism at the federal
level and which said, in essence, that the
French Canadians, in the federal field as well
as in the other provinces, as far as the status
of their language is concerned, should enjoy
the same treatment as the English-speaking
Canadians enjoy in Quebec. It was stated in
the preamble of the resolution that because
Canada had been built by two nations, certain things had to follow, whereas the words
by two communities could have been used,
which would have made it much easier to
avoid the conclusion certain people have
come to. In short, the resolution calls for
bilingualism at the federal level on the basis
of the principle of two nations, and on the
basis of the principle that French Canadians
should enjoy the same status in the other
provinces that English Canadians enjoy in
the province of Quebec.
Now, I think my friend Senator Langlois
will admit thatHon. Mr. Langlois: You must answer my
question.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: Yes, I believe you asked
me a question and I am attempting to replyHon. Mr. Langlois: Not by making a speech.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: Perhaps not, but you did
question me on a rather vast subject. The
principle adopted by the Government and reflected in the act, which was passed at the
last session, concerning the status of the
official languages, is the same as the one we
advocated previously. I say it was merely
political shrewdness, electoral cunning that
created confusion around those two words;
and now you take advantage of it-as we
say in English-to rub it in.
Hon. Mr. Langlois: Honourable senators, I
am sorry I touched on what is such a political
sore point with my honourable friend, and
I apologize to him for having done so. I
would rather have had him reply to my
question instead of making a speech that had
absolutely nothing to do with the problem
I put to him, because I know no more now
than I did at the start.

them better than I did. They rose and gave
me a standing ovation and told me afterwards
that these are facts which should have been
known to the people of Canada. They said,
"We do not know what you do down there
and what part the Senate plays." I made the
comment that the media in Canada does not
seem to know what the role of the Senate is
either. If you read the press you will find
them writing of "members of Parliament and
senators". What they mean, of course, are
members of the House of Commons and senators. We are members of Parliament too, but
even the press seems to have forgotten that.
Honourable senators, we were set up by the
British North America Act as an integral part
of Parliament with a vital role to perform. Do
not let us play that role down and say, "Oh,
no, we are not doing much here so we are
going to try to turn ourselves into an investigative body." This is wrong, because if we
do that then we shall be abdicating our position. We shall be yielding in panic to ignorant
critics and paving the way for the abolition of
this chamber. I repeat, we have too many
committees in this bouse. Standing committees, yes; we know they are doing an excellent job, but if we are going to set ourselves
up to investigate this, that and the other thing
clear across the country, then we are on our
way out. It seems to me that half our time in
this house is spent trying to get out from
under piles of paper work. We are choked by
paper and reports of these committees. When
we are not supposed to be reading these
reports, which no human being ever could
read, then we must sit here and listen to the
travelogues of gentlemen who go to this or
that defunct organization.
I will be frank with you. One is the British
Commonwealth Organization, another is
I.P.U., and a third is NATO. I feel that these
organizations are cliche-ridden and defunct,
and yet our members are running all over the
world attending conventions and coming back
to tell us about them. I am not criticizing
Senator Langlois, who made an excellent
report yesterday. At least he had the good
grace and sense to say, "Look, these are the
resolutions; let us do something about them."
What have we been doing about these resolutions, passed here and there and even in nonparliamentary countries, and these delegates
who come back and tell us that at 2 or 3
o'clock on an afternoon Lady Somebody
served tea?
Honourable senators, this is not the role of
the Senate. We do not need to meet here
[Hon. Mr. O'Leary (Carleton).]

January 29, 1970

every day. We meet here to review legislation, and my only complaint is that we are
not reviewing more of the administrative business of this country, nor are we looking at the
orders in council that are passed. Everybody
knows that 90 per cent of the administration
of this country consists of orders in council.
These are things that we should be doing, but
for heaven's sake do not let us play down our
own importance by saying, "Look, we are not
doing much; we will try to do something else;
we are going to investigate this and that." We
cannot do these things effectively. I assure
you that no matter how good some of the men
who are running these committees may be,
we cannot do this investigatory work effectively. All we are doing is getting headlines,
and some of them are not too favourable.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Hazen Argue: Honourable senators,
whether or not we all agree with the very
strong points that have been made by Senator
O'Leary, I think I can say that as long as he
and others like him are in this chamber it will
be a very lively place and is in no danger
whatsoever of dying now or in the foreseeable
future.
I appreciate the point that Senator O'Leary
has made, namely, that if we have too many
inquiries going on and too many committees
working at one time, the Senate itself cannot
do an effective job. But I can hear the
speeches that would be made in this chamber
today if we had been faced with a resolution
in the other place to set up a committee of
the other place, excluding any representatives
of the Senate, to inquire into and report upon
changes that may be necessary in the Constitution. Therefore, we are really in favour of
this investigation. I am glad that speeches
have been made really on some other aspects,
namely, whether or not we have too many
inquiries going on. The inquiries that are
being undertaken by the Senate are excellent.
I think the work of these committees is most
outstanding and that their reports, whether it
be Mass Media, Poverty or Science Policy,
will stand as important documents pointing
the way for necessary changes for Canada in
the future.
While at home I read yesterday's Citizen
and I was absolutely amazed by the volume
and the quality of the newspaper coverage
that was given to the Senate and its committees yesterday. There may be some danger in
having too many inquiries, and I can see
them, but certainly the greatest danger facing

January 29, 1970

SENATE DEBATES

the Senate, if we want to discuss danger, is
that the Senate is doing too little. The Senate
today is exceedingly active.
Having said that I agree with Senator
O'Leary in many respects, I hope I will not be
considered inconsistent. I do feel that the
deliberations of this body and this chamber is
the principal function of the Senate-the
legislative function, the reviewing function.
We should not only be engaged in reviewing
what comes to us, we should be taking more
initiative in putting legislation forward from
this chamber. If I may say so, when the
Senate puts forward legislation, we should
not be so timid as to fail to deal with that
legislation, letting it die on the order paper
and allowing somebody else take it up and
get credit for some of the work done in this
chamber.
I want to make a point that I feel is important and needs to be made if the Senate, and
in particular, the work done in the chamber,
is to function efficiently. I notice that as soon
as a Senate committee is set up to make a
special inquiry, very large sums of money are
appropriated to that committee for researching and for the functioning of the committee.
Once a Senate committee is set up, apparently money is no object.
Hon. Mr. Martin: It is now.
Hon. Mr. Argue: Apparently it is no object,
because it runs into hundreds of thousands
of dollars. They acquire very competent help,
and I do not object to that. But what help
does an individual senator have to assist him
in his work as a member of this chamber?
As a former member of the House of Commons, I was shocked, when I came here to see
the kind of secretarial arrangements which
senators have. It is most inefficient. A senator
who really wants to get his work done is
unable to do so. There is no research help
that I know of available to senators.
Members of the House of Commons respect
themselves individually, and when they
respect themselves they ask for adequate
secretarial help. Until recently every member
has had one secretary, and I am informed
now that many have two secretaries-some
have three, when required. Back-bench members of Parliament feel they need that kind of
help to do their work. They are getting more
and more research assistance attached to
their political party. We do not get any.
The Library staff does its best. I have found
them most co-operative. They are becoming

overloaded. The time lag now is such that I
think you have to give them a month's notice
or more to get any kind of a specialized
document.
I would hope that the Senate will change
this, so that individual senators may have the
kind of research help that is required if we
are to make effective contributions in this
chamber. At least we should have the
secretarial help needed to discharge the functions of a senator. If a senator is prepared to
work, he should have whatever secretarial
and research assistance is required to help
him to do an effective job.
This resolution to set up a joint committee
of the Senate and the House of Commons
follows a debate in the House of Commons on
this important question. If there was one
theme running through the whole of the
Prime Minister's presentation, I think it was
this, that he and the Government wished to
see this committee set up so that there could
be a concensus taken across this country, so
that the ordinary Canadian would have a
chance to present his views and to make his
wishes known. That is a very commendable
attitude.
The attitude of the official Opposition in
that debate-when one takes out the normal
political content one would expect-was good.
The contribution made by the Leader of the
Opposition in the other place, in pointing out
the importance of this committee, was most
commendable. He suggested that the committee in great measure should be non-partisan,
that it should have English and French cochairmen. He also suggested-and I think
that this has merit-that one of the chairmen should be taken from the ranks of the
Opposition.
Hon. Mr. Martin: Of course.
Hon. Mr. Argue: The discussion of necessary changes in the Constitution of this country is not basically a party political matter.
Hon. Mr. Martin:
co-chairmen.

There

will be such

Hon. Mr. Argue: I am glad to hear from our
leader that this arrangement is being made. I
am sure that when this committee goes across
Canada it will do effective work and that
recommendations will be made from time to
time to deal with the more urgent aspects of
this question.
There is the whole question of urban
affairs, of environhment, of transportation, of
housing, all coming to the fore. The demands

SENATE DEBATES

on government-municipal, provincial or federal-are becoming astronomical. It is almost
impossible now for governments to meet their
budgets. So, there is an economie crisis which
must be considered and dealt with.
There is the question of our two major
cultural groups living together in this country. There is the question of citizens within
the various regions of our country being sufficiently satisfied with their role and treatment
that they are enthusiastic citizens and wish to
remain as part of Canada.
The whole question of regional disparity is
one which is getting greater attention, and it
is needed, if this country is to be kept together and if the opposition to Confederation is
not to grow in parts of our nation.
The fact is that Ontario is prosperous. The
fact is that Quebec is not as prosperous as it
should be. The fact is that the Maritime
Provinces are not prosperous. The fact is that
the Prairie Provinces are not prosperous and
face very difficult economic circumstances at
this time.
There has been a growing feeling of alienation among the people of the Prairies for a
number of years. This feeling of alienation, of
being overlooked, of being made second-class
citizens, of being ridiculed, of being sneered
at-often by people in high places-is doing
damage. There is talk of separation on the
Prairies. I do not think it is the kind of
separation that is talked about in the Province of Quebec. I cannot speak as one who
fully understands the motives of people who
preach separatism in the Province of Quebec.
I believe that such talk of separatism on the
Prairies stems from a feeling of economic
inferiority. It is a question of dollars and
cents. They are "fed up" in an economic way;
they are not particularly unhappy for other
reasons. I do not believe that attitude fully
applies in the Province of Quebec. The Prairies are having their difficulties. Saskatchewan, as the central or the main agricultural
province on the Prairies, is having even
greater difficulties than its neighbours.
Sterling King of the Regina Leader-Post, a
distinguished journalist, in an article yesterday based on Dominion Bureau of Statistics
housing statistics, shows that housing starts in
Saskatchewan dropped off 12.4 per cent in
1966. I have in my hand the Globe and Mail
of January 22, 1970, in which are quoted the
various economic statistics showing the state
of the economy of the Province of Saskatchewan. Our population is going down. For the
[Hon. Mr. Argue.]

January 29, 1970

first time in a couple of decades we do not
have even a small net growth. We have an
absolute loss of population. We have had a
drop in gross personal income from $2,291
million in 1968 to $2,465 million in 1969; a
drop in farm cash receipts from $684 million
in 1968 to $554 million in 1969.
Saskatchewan, as a province, is in great
economic difficulty today. If one travels the
rural areas one will very quickly pick up a
feeling of pessimism. Farm implement dealers
are closing their doors. People are moving off
the farms. If you drive along the streets in
the City of Regina you will see home after
home with "for sale" signs.
Many of the construction firms are moving
out of the City of Regina; some are even
geing bankrupt. Many of the major farm
implement companies are removing their
parts depots from Regina to places outside
the province.
This situation is coupled with difficulties in
the potash industry, together with a falling
off in the general exploration in the oil
industry.
There is rank and growing dissatisfaction
on the Prairies with the treatment that we
receive within Confederation. As I have
already said, I think it is a question of dollars
and cents. All that the people on the Prairies
are asking for is that steps be taken to give
them the same kind of opportunities that prevail in the wealthier provinces.
It is my opinion that the constitutional
committee will enable persons who feel they
have particular grievances, whether those
persons are from the Prairies, the Maritimes
or Quebec, to present their grievances, and it
is my hope that such persons will, as a result
of having done that, feel that their points of
view will get consideration and that, where
necessary, recommendations to change the
Constitution will be made.
Representation in the Senate is based on
regions. There are 24 senators from Ontario;
24 from Quebec; 24 from the west and 24
from the original maritime provinces, with
six additional senators from Newfoundland.
With that representation in mind, may I point
out to you that we have had presented to us
today a resolution naming ten senators to sit
on the constitutional committee. It would
have been reasonable to expect that every
possible effort would have been made to distribute Senate representation on that committee in such a way as to give a fair voice, a

January 29, 1970

SENATE DEBATES

reasonable voice, to the various regions and
parts of Canada.
It should be noted that those of us who
come from the more sparsely settled areas of
Canada do not have the proportionate voice
in the House of Commons that we have in
representation in the Senate. As Mr. Pat
Mahoney, M.P., pointed out recently, three
out of five members of Parliament come from
a ribbon of land approximately 100 miles
wide, ranging from the City of Windsor to the
City of Quebec. He pointed out that the Province of Ontario has a larger representation in
the House of Commons than the total representation of the three Prairie Provinces and
the four Maritime Provinces. In other words,
things are loaded against the west and the
east because of population distribution.
Bearing in mind what I have just said, let
us consider the representation proposed for
the committee on the Constitution. Of the ten
senators proposed, four are to come from
Quebec, three are to come from Ontario, one
is to come from Newfoundland, one from
Nova Scotia and one from Saskatchewan. Not
one senator has been proposed to represent
the provinces of British Columbia, Alberta,
Manitoba, New Brunswick, or Prince Edward
Island.
Perhaps it is not practicable to have every
province represented, but surely we can do
better than have seven representatives from
the two central provinces, two from the
east and one for the four western provinces.
When the committee on the Constitution
crosses the country, do not expect that its
own constitution will go unnoticed. Is it to be
expected that the neglected provinces will be
pleased with the composition of this committee? The year 1970 is Manitoba's Centennial
year; for them it is a year of great celebrations; they are celebrating the fact that 100
years ago they entered Confederation. Nevertheless, it has not been seen fit to recommend
that the Province of Manitoba have a
representative from the Senate to sit on the
committee set up to study the Constitution.
Having made those observations, let me
assure honourable senators that I am in no
way critical of the individual senators whose
names have been put forward to comprise the
committee on the Constitution. I am not at all
critical of them; in fact, I am sure every one
of them is competent and will do the best job
he can. It is just that I am so keenly disappointed in the geographical distribution of
this committee's representation-a distribution which I have already given you.

I have endeavoured to obtain the names of
the 20 members of the Commons who are to
be appointed to that committee. As of an hour
or so ago the committee list had not yet been
composed. I am not, therefore, able to say
whether the disparity that has been shown
with respect to Senate representation wil be
to any extent offset by the appointment of
members of the Commons. I should hope so.
In any event, in choosing the members for
such a committee, I think it would have been
a much better approach to have all senators
present at a meeting at which their opinions
could have been expressed on what kind of
distribution would be best, and what particular senators might have been their choice. It
might have been decided that there should be
so many members from the Government side
and so many from the Opposition side; it
might have been decided that so many senators would be from the west and so many
from the east, and so on. The various regions
might then have had some voice in choosing
their own representatives. Certainly, if this
matter had been looked at before the names
were presented to the house, I, for one, am
convinced that there would not have been
this kind of regional disparity in the distribution of members of the committee. It just does
not make any sense. You cannot say that of
all of the senators from western Canada there
is only one who is capable or willing to sit on
the committee. I should hope that this kind of
mistake-and I am convinced it was a mistake-might be corrected.
I think that the representatives from
Quebec would give sympathetic consideration
to the needs of the people on the Prairies.
The same applies to the representatives from
Ontario. But I also think that if there are to
be authentic voices on this committee, members who understand the economic life of the
people in this area, there is no substitute for
members of the Senate or members of the
Commons who come from the area. I do not
know what has been the practice in the past
in this chamber, but I do feel-and if I am
incorrect in this I hope I will be correctedthat there should have been a general discussion, which there was not, as to the composition of this committee. If the Governnent
Leader in the Senate picked this listbecause he is a member of the Cabinet who
sis in the Cabinet with the Prime MinisterI think it is a mistake, because I do not think
the members of this chamber to sit on this
important Constitutional Committee should

SENATE DEBATES

be picked in the main by any one person or
by a representative of the Government.
The Prime Minister has made it clear that
ho wants this committee to take a careful and
unbiased look at the Constitution, and I would
think that if this unbiased look is to be
assured, appointments to the committee
should not stem from the Cabinet itself or a
member of the Cabinet, but rather, if we are
going to practice and promote democracy, we
should have a general discussion on the division of representation. Some allocation should
be made to the various regional caucuses in
the composition of members of this committee.
Honourable senators, I hope that nothing I
have said will seem to criticize in any way
the ability, the compassion, or the objectivity
of the proposed members of this committee.
However, I emphasize that an area such as
western Canada which is entitled to representation by 24 senators should be entitled to
more than one seat on the committee, and
that 70 per cent of the membership should
not represent the provinces of Quebec and
Ontario.
If this committee composed of 10 senators
and 20 members of the House of Commons is
given the time and the research assistance
required, it will do a good job for Canada.
But I hope that before the committee
begins its deliberations there will be some
redress, some change in what I consider to be
an inequitable regional apportionment of the
membership.
Hon. Mr. Martin: That was a very good
speech.
Hon. Donald Cameron: Honourable senators, at the outset let me say how pleased I
am to see this resolution on the Order Paper.
I have every confidence that the proposed
deliberations will serve a very useful purpose.
I listened to Senator O'Leary with my usual
attention, and as usual he has put his finger
on some of the priorities which must not be
forgotten in this chamber. There is no doubt
whatever that the first responsibility of this
chamber is the review of legislation. It bas
done an excellent job in the past in this
sphere and will no doubt continue to do so in
the future. Senator O'Leary, in referring to
the number of committees, said that we have
too many. I think it is certainly true to say
today that the committee load is getting
exceedingly heavy, so heavy that I fear that
many of us cannot do as effective a job either
in committee or in the house itself as we
would like to do. One of the reasons why we
[Hon Mr. Argue.]

January 29, 1970

cannot do as good a job as we would like to
do stems from the fact that we do not have
the resources or the staff which any business
organization should have and which, more
particularly, the Parliament of Canada should
have.
There has been discussion over the years
about giving members of Parliament-and in
that term I include members of the Senateadequate resources of staff to enable them to
do the kind of job that is expected of them.
So far these resources have not been
forthcoming.

Honourable senators, in my view the establishment of this committee is a very wise
step. I feel it is also wise to have it meet
across Canada and thus give the ordinary
people from one end of the country to the
other an opportunity to participate in its
hearings, to express their views and opinions
and so get the message through to the sites of
power in Ottawa. In this respect I must say to
my friend the Leader of the Government, for
whom I have the greatest respect, that I
looked forward to the naming of the members
of this committee with much interest. The one
reservation which I had made mentally was
that I hoped it would not be overloaded with
lawyers. Now, that is no reflection on lawyers; they have a role to play and a vitally
important role, but I want to emphasize that
this constitutional problem is not only a legal
problem. It is an economic problem; it is a
sociological problem; it is a problem of communication and in particular it is an emotional problem. It is important that the citizens
should feel that they have the opportunity of
having their say to the people who are to
formulate the new Constitution. With that
one reservation I say to the honourable leader
that I am delighted to see this resolution and
I hope it will lead to fruitful results.
Honourable senators, if you look over the
history of constitutional debate for the last
number of years you will see that it has been
in the hands of the legal officers of Parliament and of the Crown; you will also see that
they have not been notably successful in finding practical solutions so far. We hope that
this committee will be an exception to what
has gone before. But, regardless of its composition, the idea of a joint committee of both
houses of Parliament is an excellent one.
Referring to the geographical distribution
of the committee, I realize the leader's difficulty in staffing a committee of this importance at this time, because many members of

January 29, 1970

SENATE DEBATES

the Senate are already heavily involved in
other committees. This in turn raises the
question about the number of vacancies in
the Senate. Of course it is not my perogative
to do anything about that situation, but certainly the time has come when, if the Senate
is to mean anything, it is not right that the
Province of British Columbia should have
four vacancies-actually five, because a very
distinguished member of this bouse from that
province bas not been here for the last year. I
hope that something will be done soon about
that situation because, as I have said, the load
is getting very heavy for the senators who are
here.
On the other hand, coming back to the
geographical representation of the committee,
let me say that I am old enough to remember
the days of the Progressives in 1922.
Hon. Mr. Martin: You may be old enough,
but that does not mean you are old.
Hon. Mr. Cameron: Thank you. In fact, my
father was one of the supporters of that particular parliamentary group, and I remember
the feeling when the Honourable Mr. Crerar,
a very good friend of all of us and a highly
respected Canadian, led the Progressives into
the Mackenzie King Government. I remember
the feeling of betrayal on the Prairies. There
are many who have not forgiven Mr. Crerar
to this day for what they considered a betrayal. I think that he made a great contribution
to Canada and he is a man I admire greatly,
although I have always felt that he spelled his
kind of liberalism: c-o-n-s-e-r-v-a-t-i-v-e.
Today the situation on the Prairies, to
which Senator Argue referred, is worse than
it was in 1922. It is not a feeling of separatism
but a feeling of disillusionment and dissatisfaction, and a sense of injustice. It would
have been a tactical move in the right direction to have found some formula by which
there could be more western representation
on this committee. I realize the leader's difficulty in getting that kind of representation
today because of the situation we find ourselves in, with 14 or 15 vacancies in the
Senate, and the fact we have the heaviest
load of committee work we have had in the
history of the Senate. While I have some sympathy with what Senator O'Leary has said in
this respect, I am delighted that the present
Leader of the Government has seen fit to
make it possible for al these committees to
sit, because I think we have a role to play in
this regard. At no time since I have been
21498-30

here-and that goes back to 1955-has the
Senate been more effective than it is today,
always remembering the limiting factor that
many senators are overburdened at the present time.
Make no mistake about it, when you read
in the press that the sale of one good crop or
an increase of a cent or two in the price of oil
or gas on the Prairies would settle the discontent, that is the most fallacious thinking that
could possibly exist today. The root causes
are much more serious than that. With my
knowledge of the Prairies and of western
Canada generally-and this goes back quite a
long time-I have never seen anything that
would compare with the sense of frustration
and the sense of anger that is developing with
respect to what is happening in Ottawa.
Indeed, I say this, that if there were an election within the next six months there would
not be one member of the Government reelected from the Prairie Provinces. That is a
serious statement to make, but I know it is
true; and, if you do not think it is, ask some
of the sitting members.
This matter of how we grapple with the
problems of the Constitution-the legal, economic, emotional and sociological problemsis one of the greatest challenges we have to
face today. I extend to the members named to
the committee my congratulations on their
having the opportunity to tackle a major task
for the benefit of this country, and my very
best wishes for every success.
I hope the leader wil keep in mind the fact
that the situation is more touchy today than
it has ever been, and anything he can do to
make sure the western voice is heard, not
only on this committee but on other committees, will stand him in good stead.
Hon. J. Campbell Haig: Honourable senators, ever since this resolution was first presented to this house it had been my intention
to deal only with one aspect of it, but because
the preceding speakers today have discussed
certain other questions, I want to make my
position clear.
I am not going to discuss the matter of
secretarial and research assistance given us or
our parties in this house. I do not think geographical location is any criterion for
appointment to a committee. If a man comes
from the west or the east or the central part
and is capable of doing the job, that man
should be appointed. I am in violent disagreement with Senator Cameron's remarks in con-

SENATE DEBATES
nection with the appointment of lawyers to
this committee. If he will analyze the background of the 10 Senate members of this committee he will see that fiveHon. Mr. Choquette: Six.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Six are members, and
honoured members, of the legal profession.
What I want to discuss this afternoon is the
provision in the motion to sit during sittings
of the Senate. I raised this whole question
back in December last year in connection
with committees meeting simultaneously.
Take yesterday as an example: Banking,
Trade and Commerce met at 9 a.m.; Legal
and Constitutional Affairs, at 11 a.m.; Science
Policy, at 11 a.m.-and there was nothing in
the afternoon. Today we will adjourn until
Tuesday at 8 p.m. Why could we not sit, say,
at 3 o'clock on Tuesday afternoon, maybe for
an hour, and then adjourn until 8 p.m., so
that senators from Toronto, Montreal, Quebec
generally and intervening points could get
here?
Hon. Mr. Martin: I wish we could do that.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I agree with the Government Leader. What I am saying is that this
was discussed last December, that the chairmen of committees should get together and
make full use of our time on Tuesdays,
Wednesdays and Thursdays, but nothing
happened.
In these days of computers and all the rest
of it, why cannot we make full use of our
time on Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays, and if special committees want to go
tripping around the country, let them do so in
their own time on Mondays, Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays. We are not making the
best use of our time here on the other days.

January 29, 1970

Hon. Mr. Martin: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Haig: For instance, we have the
Banking, Trade and Commerce Committee
meeting to discuss the White Paper. They
have appointed their staff, and it is a very
competent staff. They have received 200
briefs or more. That committee will sit on
Wednesdays. Another committee says that
their day is Thursday. Next week a certain
special conmittee is sitting on Thursday. A
standing committee of this bouse has advised
us that they will be sitting next Thursday at
11 a.m. because they have asked a company
or organization to send representatives to
appear on that date. Where in the name of
heaven is there any co-operation among these
committees who invite outsiders--and I am
not talking about government officials, but
outsiders-to avoid this continual overlapping? Special committees could sit on Tuesday
morning.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: They do.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Some of them do and some
do not, but now we are adjourning until
Tuesday at 8 p.m. In the past we have
adjourned until Tuesday at 3 p.m., and sat for
an hour and a half or two hours and then
again at 8 p.m.
So, I am suggesting that the Government
Leader, together with the Opposition Leader
and the Whips and chairmen of committees,
devise some method by which we can better
use our time in transacting the business of
the Senate.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Grosart, debate
adjourned.
The Senate adjourned until Tuesday, February 3, at 8 p.m.

MASS MEDIA
COMMITTEE AUTHORIZED TO MEET DURING
SITTINGS OF SENATE

Hon. A. Hamilton McDonald, with leave of
the Senate, and notwithstanding Rule 45(1)(a),
moved:
That Rule 76(4) be suspended in relation to the Special Committee of the
Senate on Mass Media from 10th to 19th
February, both inclusive, and that the
committee have power to sit during sittings of the Senate for that period.
Hon. Keith Davey: Honourable senators,
because I am mindful that on the last occasion permission to meet during sittings of the
Senate for a two-week period was granted
only on division, may I briefly elaborate on
this request.
The Special Senate Committee on Mass
Media has honestly striven to avoid meeting
during sittings of the Senate. For example,
we sat throughout the week of January 19,
when the Senate was still in recess.
As you may realize, this hearings phase of
our study was divided into five two-week
periods. Two of those two-week periods have
now been completed. There are three more
two-week periods to come, one of them between February 10 and 19, which we are discussing this evening. Subsequently, we shail
seek similar permission in connection with
the two then remaining two-week periods
which terminate on April 17, when our public
hearings will end.
I should like to stress also that in those
two-week periods when our committee does
sit it meets all day Tuesday but not that
evening when the Senate is sitting, all day
Wednesday and in the evening, all day Thursday and in the evening, and usually it meets
as well on Friday morning. In other words,
any possible conflict would arise only on
Wednesday and Thursday afternoons. In
[Hon. Mr. Martin.]

February 3, 1970

essence, we are talking tonight about two
Wednesday and Thursday afternoons. Including all our subsequent requests until the
end of our hearings, we will be talking about
only six Wednesday and six Thursday afternoons. That includes the request we are
making this evening.
I should add that our meetings over the
two-week period that begins next week will
embrace a discussion of the student press, the
ethnic press, the business press, and consumer
magazines. One of the highlights of that twoweek period will be the appearance of the
honourable Senator O'Leary on Tuesday, February 17. I mention this because I was in the
chamber last week when Senator O'Leary
expressed concern about the role and function
of various Senate committees. I might add
that I share his concern. Indeed, upon the
completion of our study I may be able to add
something useful to that discussion.
In concluding my remarks I should like to
quote in part from an editorial which
appeared

in

the

Toronto Daiiy Star last

Saturday:
Something has already been accomplished by the Senate's special committee
on the mass media. It has got the press of
Canada talking about itself, defending
itself, and even criticizing itself in ways
that never seem to happen-openly, at
any rate-during conventions of newspaper publishers, editors or unions.
The editorial concludes:
We commend the committee for having
started a process of criticism which will,
hopefully, make the press more lively
and responsive to the people without
endangering its traditional freedoms.
I should add, perhaps, that many publishers
have expressed the same sentiment before the
committee, privately in conversation, and formally in written briefs.
Honourable senators, I earnestly hope that
the Senate will accede to this request and
grant us clearance.
Motion agreed to.
ADJOURNMENT
Hon. A. Hamilton McDonald: Honourable
senators, with leave of the Senate, and notwithstanding Rule 45(l(g), I move that when
the Senate adjourns today it do stand
adjourned until tomorrow, Wednesday, February 4, at 2 o'clock in the afternoon.

Februry 3,1970SENATE
DEBATES

February 3, 1970

I might say that a similar motion bas been
before the house on many previous occasions
over the past few weeks. There seems to be a
view held by senators and the public generally
that it would be better if the Senate sat at 2
o'clock in the afternoon rather than at 3
o'clock.
As honourable senators know, under our
rules the regular hour for sitting is three
o'clock in the afternoon. During the recent
review of the rules there was considerable
discussion on this matter, and the decision
was that we should sit at three o'clock daily.
However, I repeat, since that time we have on
several occasions sat at the earlier bour mainly
because of requets from honourable senators,
and I arn wondering if it is not time to take
another look at this rule. I would ask bonourable senators to give this question some consideration and convey their wishes to Senator
Molson, Chairman of the Standing Senate
Committee on Standing Rifles and Orders. I
amn sure that if hie finds the majority of senators feel that our purposes would be better
served by sitting at two o'clock rather than
three o'clock hie will take steps to see whether
the rule can be changed. 1 ask honourable
senators to convey their thoughts and wisbes
to the chairman of the committee.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Hear, hear.
Hon. Jacques Flynn: Honourable senators, I
arn not opposing the motion at this time. 1
have no objection to sitting at two o'clock on
Thursday, or any other day, but the main
rea-son that we usually meet at three o'clock
on Wednesday is because very often a committee can complete its work between two
and three o'clock. I might also mention that
only a few days ago the group on this side of
the bouse met in caucus, and we thought that
between two and three o'clock Wednesday
was the proper time for such a meeting. I
think it is a good idea that this question be
examined by the Standing Senate Committee
on Standing Rules and Orders, but I suggest
that there may be a good and valid reason for
retaining the sitting time of three o'clock at
least on Wednesdays.
Motion agreed to.

CONSTITUTION OF CANADA

[Hon. Mr. Martin.]

February 3, 1970

SENATE DEBATES

over the years, of the discussions in this Parliament, of the federal-provincial conferences,
and of the federal-provincial meetings which
have taken place, in the modern sense, from
1927 onwards.
The honourable Leader of the Government
will remember-because he participated
actively and well-the conferences of 19351936, 1950, 1960-1961, and 1964, to mention
only the more formal ones. These conferences
were not successful. The reason, it seems to
me, is that too much stress was placed on the
views of the constitutional lawyers and the
political scientists, and not enough on the
views of the average Canadian who, surely, is
by now very tired of being told that technolegal problems are enough to prevent us as
Canadians from repatriating our Constitution
and writing a Constitution which will meet
whatever requirements we think are necessary today.
As we approach the problem, it seems to
me there are at least three major ways of
looking at the question and deciding what
kind of Constitution we are to have in
Canada. The first is to agree at the start that
the marriage, in spite of its difficulties, is successful or, if not, that we are determined for
the sake of our children and others to make it
a success and keep it going. Let us agree at
the start that this is the basic hypothesis of
any discussions we might have-that we are
going to stick together. There are some contrary views.
The second is to assume that we are all
starting afresh, that we have ten provinces,
all as independent as the original three provinces that agreed in Charlottetown in 1864
and in Quebec two years later on a formula,
and that for this purpose the ten provinces
are self-governing and independent. So we
are looking at the whole problem afresh. We
are now in the year 1970, and we say let us
forget past history and ask ourselves, all ten
provinces, what we should do. That approach
would write out completely, for this particular moment, the whole concept of a federal
Government. This might be an interesting
start, since the provinces would then have to
look at alternatives. For example, do we need
a Confederation at all? Do we need one
confederation? Do we need two, three or perhaps four confederations?
The third approach is to say that the marriage, with all its faults, has worked reasonably well over the years. This is the kind of
thing married people sometimes say as the

years go on: "We have lived together al these
years; we have had our battles; we have had
our arguments; but on the whole it has
worked out pretty well. It seems to make
sense to go on."
The suggestion really is that the Constitution bas been working rather well for a hundred years, and perhaps with some updating
revisions it could work well for another hundred. I am inclined to opt for the third alternative, because a completely new Constitution, which is sometimes suggested, offers
many dangers. The recent evidence we have
had of the viability of new constitutions in
new nations around the world is not very
heartening. Most of them have looked very
good in theory. Some of them have been
written by eminent constitutional lawyers.
But many of them have broken down, and, as
we have seen in the case of Lesotho just
recently, broken down almost immediately.
They have broken down, of course, on practical grounds.
This concept of a new Constitution is at
odds with our political traditions. It is revolutionary rather than evolutionary. It will tend
to be highly theoretie and academic and will
be much too likely to suffer the fate of most
of the new constitutions that have come into
effect in recent years.
The distinguished Judge Haliburton, many
years ago in expressing his views in the
character of Sam Slick, made the very wise
observation: "You can change constitutions
forever but you cannot change men." I
think the same objection applies to the idea
of looking at this problem of co-existence as if
it began this year. I think it is important for
us to remember that we have had a hundred
years experience with our present Constitution and its problems, and that the experience
has not been altogether bad. Colectively, we
have achieved the second or third highest
standard of living in the world, and a federation which achieves that deserves some
degree of credit.
It is true, as Senator Cameron and others
have pointed out recently, we do have the
real problem of redistributing that very high
level of income. But, surely, in looking at the
history of the achievements of the Constitution over the years, we would have to admit
that it is rather better to have the problem of
redividing a high level of income than to be
worrying about a low level of income, a situation which could very well have developed in
Canada.
We have to remember also that in spite of
our many internal worries-which we seem

SENATE DEBATES
to keep expressing almost schizophrenically,
about our search for a Canadian identitynevertheless, with this experiment of a hundred years with our Constitution, we have
made the name "Canada" around the world
stand for something we can be proud of.
Canada has achieved a respect that some
nations, which have been at the nation-building business for a very long time, have not
achieved quite as well.
We should remember also that one of the
very remarkable things about this Constitution with which we have been living for more
than a century is its remarkable flexibility.
We talk of the difficulty of amending it. That
seems to pose a great problem. Books have
been written about it. But the fact of the
matter is we have had on the federal side at
least 22 amendments, and others as well from
the provincial legislatures. It has been a flexible Constitution. It has not been that hard to
amend.
The honourable Leader of the Government,
who took a leading part in one of the major
amendments, will, I think, agree with me that
the amendment of 1949, which gave to Parliament the power of amending the Constitution
within certain limits on matters dealing solely
with the federal responsibility, was a very
great achievement and was not very difficult
to bring about.
We talk about the heavy financial demands
at times of federal Government on national
income. We tend at the same time to forget
that the long-term trend has been rather the
other way. The long-term trend has been that
the demands of the provincial governments
have been rising. That has not been a steady
trend, for during the two world wars the
demand of the federal Government on gross
national income rose noticeably. But here
again there has been a tremendous flexibility
in the Constitution. There can be no argument about that. The provinces agreed that it
was necessary under certain emergency conditions for the federal Government to spend
more money and, therefore, for it to collect a
larger share of the gross national income.
We talk also about roadblocks to progress
in some of the built-in inhibitions in the Constitution. One often mentions the exclusive
jurisdiction of the provinces in the field of
education. We in the Science Policy Committee have heard a great deal about that. The
fact of the matter is, of course, that nobody
bothers at all about the exclusive power of
the provinces-not even the Province of
[Hon. Mr. Grosart.]

Quebec. The Province of Quebec has very
gladly accepted the grants to universities so
that today in the field of post-secondary education 50 per cent of the cost is paid by the
federal Government. In the field of graduate
education hundreds of millions of dollars a
year are supplied by the federal Government
under the disguise, the expedient, if you like,
of research and development grants. But anybody who has listened to the evidence given
to the Special Senate Committee on Science
Policy will be fully aware that the universities are under no illusions as to the purpose of
these grants. They have made it very clear
that one of the main purposes of the grants is
to upgrade the level of education at the postgraduate level.
This, perhaps, suggests another approach
which strangely enough has not had very
much attention in the past. Why do we not
ask ourselves more often than we do why has
this Constitution lasted 100 years? What are
the reasons? What are its sound and enduring
features? I think we all know that any firstyear law student can tell us what is wrong
with the Constitution, but from my reading it
takes a much better analysis than I have seen
recently to explain what is right with the
Constitution. What are the built-in features
that have made it work for so long? Perhaps
before we start tearing the Constitution apart
we should give very careful attention to the
things that we are not going to tear apart. It
would make a very good exercise. Perhaps the
research director of the committee to be set up
might be asked to set out the enduring things
in this Constitution which we have had for
100 years-the things that make it work.
Honourable senators, it has worked. We are
still a nation. We hear rumbles of separatism,
but we are still a nation and, with all respect
to Senator Langlois, if there is an element of
duality in it, it is not going to bother me a
bit; I am not going to worry whether there is
some special status here or there. What is
important is that we remain a nation, and,
honourable senators, I have no doubt that we
are going to remain a nation.
I think one of the results of the deliberations of this committee will be to show us as
Canadians how we can, should and must
remain a nation. For that reason I think the
semantic argument about the deux nationsthe two nations-concept is not helpful. I am
told that the word "nation" in French has a
different connotation from that of the corresponding word "nation" in English. Frankly,
honourable senators, to me it does not matter

February 3, 1970

SENATE DEBATES

very much. We are two peoples and two cultures. We could be ten, fifteen or maybe
twenty peoples and cultures. If one of them
happens to have a numerical value of perhaps 6 million people, in my view this is not
the essence of the problem. I am convinced
that we are going to stay together. I am also
convinced that one of the results of the work
done by this committee will be to show us
all how we can work out the marriage without running to a marriage counsellor or, worse
still, running to a divorce court.
This subject brings to my mind what the
great Chinese philosopher Mencius said many
years ago:
Men must be decided on what they will
not do, then they are able to act with
vigour on the things they ought to do.
That perhaps brings up the one feature of
the constitutional debate that has special significance for this chamber. I do not consider
that this debate is the time for anybody to
attempt to make a case for the future of the
Senate. It is my own view that the Senate in
the last few years has proven that it has a
built-in, inherent ability to revive and reconstitute itself. I do not deny that we have
faults that need to be corrected. We certainly
need some help from the outside in the form
of better attitudes on the part of both the
appointer and the appointees as to the real
nature of the responsibilities and the manpower requirements for meeting those responsibilities. Nevertheless, the institution itself is
basically sound.
I think at times that if the Senate had
functioned consistently over the years in
terms of the function that was conceived for
it in 1867 we should not today, perhaps, be
worried about appointing ombudsmen; we
should not be concerned about the problems
of underprivileged minorities, and we might
not even be arguing about provincial rights.
Of course, honourable senators, there are
well-known historical reasons why we have
not, as a chamber, completely performed
these functions, reasons which to me do not
prove that the functions do not need to be
performed, that we do not need in Canada
somebody to stand up for minority groups,
individual complaints or provincial rights. It
has not been proven to me that the Senate
itself cannot perform this important function.
It is rather significant that when you look
over the proposals that have been made as a
result of this long series of conferences, and I
mention only those from 1927 on, that invari-

ably the guarantees which the institution of
the Senate represents are regarded in the
formal presentations made as a result of these
conferences as being, in effect, "entrenched".
The case for the continuation of the Senate
in the discussions that will be taking place
before long, is certainly one in which we can
expect some support from certain outside
quarters and from certain provincial governments. But it is my view, honourable senators, that the case will have to be made by
the representatives of the Senate and it will
have to be a good case.
I understand that we have named ten senators to join with our twenty colleagues in the
other place. I would like to suggest to the
honourable Leader of the Government that
we make an immediate start on presenting
the case for the Senate by having these ten
senators join together in discussion so that
individually and collectively they will be
fully cognizant of the case for the Senate. I
will go no further than that. I am not suggesting that the ten senators see themselves as a
bloc in this committee. Of course, they will
deliberate as individuals to assess the evidence that comes before them, but the case
for the Senate can and, I think must be made.
It would be most unfortunate, regarding
the evidence that will come before that committee, if the representatives of the Senate
were not fully prepared to answer any comments, criticisms or suggestions that might
arise.
In other words, I would suggest that among
the many other important functions the
representatives of this chamber will have to
perform on this important committee, not the
least, but not the greatest, will be to ensure
that the case for the Senate of Canada is
clearly understood by the committee and by
Canadians generally.
Hon. Muriel McO. Fergusson: Honourable
senators, it had not been my intention to
enter into this debate, although I am deeply
interested in and have followed the reports of
the meetings of federal and provincial
authorities which have been considering
whether or not there is any necessity to make
changes in the B.N.A. Act to meet presentday situations. However, the statements made
earlier in this debate by some senators, and
notably by Senator Argue, have led me to
feel that I would like to express my support
for some of the arguments that have been
brought forward.
Like Senator Argue, I am not at all critical
of the individual senators whose names have

SENATE DEBATES
been suggested for membership of this committee. In fact, I have the greatest respect
and admiration for each and every one of
them, and I know that they are all most
competent committee members. At the same
time, I do object to the omission from this
committee
of geographical
and
other
representation.
At the time of Confederation representation
in the Senate was definitely based on territorial considerations and not on representation by population. In fact, New Brunswick
would never have given her reluctant
consent to enter into Confederation had she
not been guaranteed that, no matter what
population changes might occur which could
and would change the representation in the
House of Commons, the Province of New
Brunswick would retain its representation in
the Senate based on territory and not on
the rise or fall of the population of the province. That is why some historians state that
the Senate-which guaranteed that there
would be adequate territorial representation
in Parliament--was the price that had to be
paid to ensure that New Brunswick would
enter into Confederation in 1867. I presume
the principle of territorial representation was
intended to be carried into participation in
the activities of the Senate, for how otherwise
could that territorial representation be truly
effective?
When a joint committee is to consider
whether changes should be made to the Constitution which was set up at that time, it
seems to me that New Brunswick-which was
a member of the original group, although, as I
have said, a reluctant one-should have
representation on such a committee. I cannot
see any reason why representatives from New
Brunswick are excluded from the list of
Senate members named to the committee.
Although, as far as I know, territorial
representation was not included in the price
that the Prairie Provinces and British
Columbia demanded when they joined
Confederation, nevertheless, the same principle of territorial representation applies to
those provinces. I agree with Senator Argue
that the appointment of only one senator
from those four provinces to this important
committee is unfair, and I say that it does
violence to the principle of territorial
representation.
Another objection I have to the motion of
the honourable leader is that it does not provide for the appointment of any women from
the Senate to this committee. The committee
[Hon. Mrs. Fergusson.]

February 3, 1970

will be reviewing suggestions for constitutional change which have been put forward
by the federal and provincial governments
and, no doubt, the members will be considering many other proposals from other sources.
The discussions will cover such matters as
social rights, shared-cost programs, language
rights, the distribution of powers between
federal and provincial jurisdictions, regional
disparity, relations between senior levels of
government in the federal and provincial
fields, and many other things that are equally
important to men and women and concerning
which many women in Canada have decided
views. It is a well-known fact that over 50 per
cent of voters in Canada are women, and I
consider that recognition of this fact should
have caused the leader to name at least one
woman member of the Senate to this
extremely important committee.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mrs. Fergusson: Before closing,
honourable senators, I would like to mention
one area to which I trust some attention will
be given by this proposed committee and
which has not been referred to in debate in
this house so far. I refer to our international
relations and the difficulty Canada has, under
our Constitution, of subscribing to and
ratifying international agreements.
As honourable senators may recall, in 1935
the federal Government signed three I.L.O.
conventions, the subject-matter of which was
partly within federal and partly within provincial jurisdiction, but which came primarily
under section 92(13) of the British North
America Act in that it concerned property
and civil rights, one of the matters assigned
to the provinces. In that same year the legislation necessary to implement those conventions was enacted by the Parliament of
Canada. Countries that are parties to such
conventions have usually ratified them by
passing the appropriate legislation. The statutes implementing those three I.L.O. conventions were, in 1937, declared by the Judicial
Committee of the Privy Coundil to be ultra
vires of the Parliament of Canada.
Since that time Canada has refrained at the
United Nations and at the I.L.O. meetings
from voting on resolutions, no matter how
good in principle, which have to do with
matters which under the British North
America Act are assigned to the provinces,
until there is assurance that all the provinces

February 3. 1970

SENATE DEBATES

are in agreement. This is a very cumbersome
procedure, and in some cases-and the honourable Leader of the Government can tell
me if I am exaggerating-the obtaining of
that agreement actually takes years.
Many countries, particularly those with unitary governiments, fail to understand, or make
allowances for, Canada's difficulties in this
regard. When the subject-matter of a resolution before an international meeting impinges
on a matter over which the provinces have
jurisdiction, Canadian spokesmen are put in
the awkward position of being able only to
commend its principle, having no power to
vote on it or to sign it on behalf of Canada.
Honourable senators, it is not only people of
other countries who ask why we cannot vote
on or sign such resolutions. Canadian citizens
have difficulty in understanding their country's position in this regard. I hope that this is
a matter that will be studied by the proposed
joint committee, and perhaps a less cumbersome method of procedure will be devised for
Canada at international meetings.
On motion of Honourable Mr. Macdonald,
debate adjourned.
RAILWAY ACT
BILL TO AMEND-SECOND READINGDEBATE ADJOURNED

Hon. G. Percival Burchill moved the second
reading of Bill C-11, to amend the Railway
Act.
He said: Honourable senators, this is a very
simple but important measure. It seeks to
delete the provision in the Railway Act which
exempts certain telecommunication services
from the regulations of the Canadian Transport Commission.
As honourable senators know, the Canadian
Transport Commission has the authority to
regulate telegram and telegraph tolls of public
utilities companies which are subject to the
jurisdiction of Parliament. The tolls and services of companies under a provincial charter
are regulated by provincial public utilities
boards.
The Railway Act was amended in 1919 to
confine the regulation of public utility compa.
nies to those services in respect of which a
toll was charged to the public. Specifically
exempted were certain other services which
are leased to customers under contract, as
opposed to regulated charges under public toll
rates. At the time this amendment was adopted these contracted services consisted largely

of contracts with brokers and newspapers,
and were known as "private wire services".
Over the years, however, these exempted
services have expanded, not only in quantity
but in diversity. In addition to brokerage and
stock market application, the traffic of television progran material and the traffic of data
into and between computers are all now
included in what is known as the "private
wire category".
As honourable senators realize, we live in a
computer age. Computers will cover this
country in the future and will be used for the
distribution and switching of scientific, medical, educational, legal, accounting, and other
categories of information and data.
In addition, the private wire category also
includes networks for television distribution,
Telex and TNX, air traffic control, voice circuits, and many other things.
This class of telecommunication services is
increasing at a rate far greater than that of
conventional telephone and telegraph services. While these services are outside the
authority of the Canadian Transport Commission by reason of this exemption, I am
advised that there is no such exemption in
the case of provincial companies that are
subject to the jurisdiction of provincial
utilities boards.
The basic need for this amendment arises
out of the difficulty in regulating a telecommunications company in respect to certain
services, such as conventional telephone and
telegraph services, while other services that
are often jointly produced are not subject to
control. It is difficult, if not impossible, to
determine what is just and reasonable in one
area of a company's services without knowing
the relative profit realized on other services
offered by the same company. The implication
is, of course, that it is possible for a company
te discriminate by applying certain charges to
one group of customers while permitting
another group to enjoy more favourable rates.
Customers must be protected, not only from
excessive charges but also from charges that
may be used to subsidize other services
offered by the same company. This is not to
say that such discrimination does or necessarily will exist, but there is that possibility.
The other significant development that has
convinced the Government that this legislation is necessary arises out of the explosive
growth of the computer industry in Canada
as well as in the rest of the modern world,
and the consequent increase in the need for

SENATE DEBATES
telecommunication services into and between
computers to accommodate the new industry.
This has become a matter of great importance
for the economic growth of this country, its
social structure and our relations with our
neighbours.
I feel that I have said enough in outlining
the principles of this legislation to convince
honourable senators that it is sound, constructive and in line with the future development of this country. There are other details
about the bill on which honourable senators
might like to have further information, and
that will be readily obtainable from officials
of the department who will be present before
the committee if this bill is given second
reading by the house. If the bill does receive
second reading, I will be glad to move that it
be referred to the Standing Senate Committee
on Transport and Communications.

February 3, 1970

even now its gross revenue is hundreds of
millions of dollars a year. Secondly, the public
networks are already regulated in the public
interest. Therefore, there is no logical reason
why the private networks should not similarly be regulated. From the point of view of
consistency, it is true that if the public networks are to be regulated, so should the
private. For these basic reasons, if for no
other, most assuredly the bill should be
approved and sent on for Royal Assent
expeditiously.
However, if we take a closer look at this
type of legislation we may discover something
that will temper the wholehearted approval
we were about to lavish on this seemingly
innocuous bill. In presenting the bill the minister said that it is:

almost assured. The taxes that aim at the
roots of our individual enterprise system also
spend and consume what generations have
built and accumulated. Heavy death duties
and highly progressive business and income
taxes tend to consume accumulated capital,
and thus severely limit future expansion.
Business profits and losses are the signals of
the free enterprise system. Taxes on profits
interfere with these important signals. They
weaken the signal of encouragement to a
profitable business and confiscate the means
needed for expansion. Thus, taxes frustrate
the adjustment the market demands, destroying the dynamism of competitive enterprise,
protecting inefficient operators at the expense
of more capable competitors. The capitalist
economy thus loses its characteristics of quick
adaptability, managerial efficiency, and keen
competition. The fundamental pillars of the
free market are dangerously weakened by
regulatory limitations placed on industries
and by excessive taxes placed on the profits
of those who are active producers in those
industries.
In closing, I should like to repeat with
regard to the proposed extension of power of
the C.T.C., that unless this pronounced trend
toward increased regulation of the daily con-

duct of business is halted, business will not
long retain the necessary freedom of decision
and the action to meet the challenges which
lie directly ahead. If we sit by and permit the
increasing encirclement of business by
bureaucratic regulations, we cannot in all
common sense continue to expect the fruits of
a vitally-needed expanding economy.
We are involved here in applying pointless
regulatory brakes to business in many important ways when we should be giving business
more freedom. We are surrounded by seemingly numberless regulations of debatable
need, uncertain effect, and arbitrary origin.
There is a danger that individual initiative
will become swamped by government edict
before enough people awake to the threat. In
the words of John Stuart Mill,
A state which dwarfs its men, in order
that they may be more docile instruments
in its hands-even for beneficial purposes-will find that with small men no

CEYLON
TWENTY-SECOND ANNIVERSARY OF
INDEPENDENCE
Hon. Leopold Langlois: Honourable senators, notwithstanding Rule 44(2), I should like
to ask leave to draw to the attention of the
Senate the occasion of the 22nd anniversary
of the independence of Ceylon.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, is it agreed?
Hon. Senators: Agreed.
Hon. Mr. Langlois: Honourable senators, as
you will recall, last Wednesday I had occasion
to describe briefly to this house the recent
visit to Ceylon of the Canadian delegation to
the Inter-Parliamentary Union Conference
held in New Delhi from October 30 until
November 7, 1969.
Today I have great pleasure in calling your
attention to the 22nd anniversary of the
independence of Ceylon. Indeed, today Ceylon
is observing a public holiday to mark its
independence. It was in 1948 that Ceylon
obtained independence while remaining a
member of the British Commonwealth. I
should like to seize this opportunity to record
briefly some of the facets and achievements
of this free, young and progressive emerging
nation.
Ceylon accepts Queen Elizabeth II as Queen
of Ceylon and Head of the Commonwealth.
Executive power is vested in the Cabinet
whose Prime Minister is appointed by the
Governor General. Parliament is bicameral,
comprising a Senate of 30 members, of whom
15 are elected by the House of Representatives and 15 are nominated by the Governor
General; and a House of Representatives, or
lower bouse, of 157 members, 151 of whom
are elected by universal suffrage and six are
nominated.
The country is divided into 21 administrative districts, in charge of government agents
appointed by the central government.
In 1947 Ceylon signed a mutual defence
pact with the United Kingdom and this con-

tinues to operate. Ceylon is not a member of
the South-East Asia Treaty Organization,
commonly referred to as SEATO.
About one-third of Ceylon's national
income is derived from the cultivation, processing and export of tea, rubber and coconuts; she is the world's second largest producer of black tea. Most of the tea and rubber is
cultivated on estates, while coconuts are predominantly a smallholder's crop. Somewhat
under half of the 52 per cent of the labour
force officially classified in the agriculture
sector are employed on estates. Domestic
agriculture consists in the main of the cultivation of rice, the staple food, but imports of
rice are still necessary.
The society of Ceylon is predominantly
rural, with only about 15 per cent of the
population living in towns, and a rapidly
expanding population, concentrated in the
south and south-west, has created heavy pressure on the densely populated zones.
The only commercially important mineral
is graphite, although there are also deposits of
iron ore, monazite, ilmenite sands, limestone,
clay and kaolin. In the absence of coal and
oil, Ceylon is developing her water resources,
and the Maskeli Oya and Samanalawewa projects are expected to produce sufficient power
to meet immediate domestic requirements.
Manufacturing and handicraft industries have
grown in importance and accounted for 12
per cent of the G.N.P. in 1967. These industries at present primarily supply the domestic
market, and the three traditional primary
products continue to account for over 90 per
cent of total exports. The United Kingdom is
Ceylon's principal trading partner, followed
by the People's Republic of China, with
which Ceylon has concluded a rice-rubber
barter agreement.
The government sector extends over many
branches of the economic activity. There are
15 state-sponsored industrial corporations,
and insurance, some transport facilities and
oil distribution have been nationalized.
Much of Ceylon is hilly and thickly
wooded, and difficult of access by road and
rail.
The railways are state-owned, with more
than 1,000 miles of track. The state also runs
the national bus service. Air Ceylon connects
the main towns of the north and east to
Colombo, and there are international services.
I wish to point out in passing that Canada
placed Ceylon on the world's jet map by the
construction a few years ago of the Katu-

nayake airport near Colombo. The port of
Colombo is one of the most important ta the
East.
There is an island network of hospitals,
clinics and dispensaries where treatmnent is
free. An institute for training and research in
community development was set up in 1966.
Rice, the staple food, is subsidized by the
state.
Education is compuisory and free between
the ages of five and fourteen. Eighty per cent
of the children were in school in 1962. There
are four universities, two of which are secular and two Buddhist, and many technical
colleges.
As a stopping place for luxury cruises and
by virtue of the spectacle of its Buddhist
festivals, ancient monuments and naturai
scenery, Ceylon is one of Asia's most important tourist centres. Good motor roads
connect Colombo to the main places of
interest. In 1967 there were 23,666 visitors
as tourists to Ceylon.
Honourable senators, I amn particuiarly
pleased to salute this friendly nation on the
occasion of the anmiversary of its independence. 1 arn sure ail honourable senators join
with me in conveying to the government and
people of Ceylon our congratulations for its
achievements as one of the most progressive
of ail emerging nations of the world, and our
best wishes for its continued prosperity and
happiness as a truly independent nation.

U.S.S.R.
VISIT BY DELEGATION FROM SENATE
CANADA TO RUSSIA

0F

Hon. Jean-Paul Descha±ele±s rose pursuant
to notice:
That he will call the attention of the
Senate to the recent visit of a delegation
from the Senate of Canada to the U.S.S.R.

and their subsequent conversations with
the leaders of the British House of Lords.
He said: Honourable senators, ta May 1969
an official invitation addressed to the Speaker
of the Senate was handed to me by His
Excellency Mr. Miroshnichenko, Ambassador
for the U.S.S.R. ta Ottawa. It was signed by
Mr. Spiridonov, Chairman of the Council of
the Union of the Supreme Soviet of the
U.S.S.R., and Mr. Paletzkis, Chairman of the
Council of Nationalities of the Supreme
Soviet. This invitation was also extended to a
small group of honourable senators, and suggested that the visit take place at the end of
1969 or the beginning of 1970.
The iast Canadian Parliamentary visit to
the U.S.S.R. was in 1965, when delegates from
both Houses of Parliament went to that country. The occasion of this last invitation was
the flrst lime on which a delegation composed
of members of the Upper House exclusively
had been invited. After consultation with the
leaders on both sides of the Senate, the Minister for External Affairs and officiais of bis
departmnent, it was decided to make this visit
in January 1970, during the Christmnas recess,
and that the foilowing senators should jota as
delegates with the Speaker: honourable Senator Connoily, P.C., representing the Leader of
the Govermnent; honourable Senator Flynn,
P.C., Leader of the Opposition; and the
honourable Senator Aird, Chairman of the
Standing Senate Cominittee on Foreign
Aiffairs. A letter of presentation from the
Minister of External Aif airs for Canada,
addressed to his counterpart in the U.S.S.R.,
Mr. Gromyko, was given to the delegation as
official recognition by the Canadian Government.
On behalf of the delegation, I wish flrst of
all to thank His Excellency the Ambassador
of the U.S.S.R. in Ottawa, his counseilor, Mr.
S. A. Boukine, and the First Secretary, Mr. A.
Makarov, for their assistance and co-operation at the several meetings held to prepare
the agenda of tis visit. During the visit our
delegation had the privilege of meeting with
the most important leaders in the U.S.S.R.
Also, on behaif of the delegation, I wish ta
express to the officiais of the Department of
External Affairs and to the officiais of the
Departrnent of Trade and Commerce our
gratitude for the time they spent with us on
various occasions ta preparation and briefing
for tis important trip. I have been a member
of many parliamentary delegations in the past
years, but very seidom has a delegation been

SENATE DEBATES
more fully or better briefed to discuss with
high-ranking Soviet ministers and deputy
ministers such topics as trade, scientifie and
cultural exchanges, peace, European security
and other matters of common interest.
Honourable senators, the fact that this delegation was composed of two English-speaking
and two French-speaking senators was purely
accidental; nevertheless, it reflected well the
bicultural character of Canada, a fact we
never failed to emphasize in the course of our
discussions abroad. The presence of the
Leader of the Opposition as a member of this
delegation is another aspect of our system of
Government that surely did not pass unnoticed.
Honourable senators, after a stay of only
ten days in the largest country of the worldlargest in terms of area, being twice the size
of Canada-I do not find it an easy task to
give in a brief report a comprehensive summary of what we saw and heard during our
travels. The delegates thought it advisable, therefore, in order to avoid repetition and
to rationalize these reports, that I should in
this first report to you give an outline of the
agenda of our visit. This is something that
ought to be done in all fairness to our hosts
and to their warm hospitality in every city
we visited. That having been done, my fellow
colleagues will be more at ease later in this
debate to deal with matters of great interest
to the Senate, such as the exchanges of views
with the Soviet leaders and other political
aspects, as well as personal impressions they
feel would be of interest for them to report.
On our way to Moscow we were the guests
of His Excellency Mr. C. S. A. Ritchie, Canadian High Commissioner to London. I should
like to express to him and to his charming wife our thanks and appreciation for
their warm and friendly reception at the
Canadian Embassy.
We arrived in Moscow late in the afternoon
of Monday, January 12, and were greeted at
the airport by a group of Soviet officials
headed by Mr. Paletskis, one of the chairmen
of the chambers of the U.S.S.R. Supreme
Soviet. Also at the airport to greet us was one
of Canada's most distinguished and capable
ambassadors abroad, and as well an expert
on Russian affairs, His Excellency, Mr.
R. A. D. Ford. Words cannot express the gratitude we owe him and Mrs. Ford for their
hospitality on many occasions at the Canadian Embassy in Moscow. Without Mr. Ford's
relentless efforts on our behalf the trip could
not have been the success it was.
[Hon. Mr. Deschatelets.]

February 4, 1970

We cannot refrain from also praising the
excellent
assistance of
Miss Elizabeth
Hesketh, Second Secretary at the Embassy in
Moscow. Miss Hesketh speaks French, English
and Russian fluently and assisted us throughout our trip in the U.S.S.R., at every meeting
and every visit prepared for us.
On Tuesday morning, January 13, we had
our first important meeting at the Kremlin
with both officials who had invited us, Mr.
Spirodonov and Mr. Paletzkis, accompanied
by a group of officials. A tour of the Kremlin
was organized during the afternoon, including
a visit to the Diamond Fund and the Armoury, a portion of the treasures of the old
regime and also a visit to the Lenin Memorial
Flat in the Kremlin where the Soviet leader
resided after leaving the former capital St.
Petersburg, which afterwards became known
as Leningrad.
It is not possible to describe the magnificent
Kremlin and I shall not attempt to do so. It
may be of some interest to mention here that
most of the historical palaces and mansions of
the old regime have been kept and restored
and are now being used by the Soviets for
governmental purposes.
On most evenings during our stay in Leningrad, Moscow and Kiev we were invited to
attend various ballet and musical presentations. In this respect I have only one comment
to make-I am still under the charm of those
outstanding performances.
On Wednesday, January 14, we had another
interesting meeting with a group of members
of the foreign affairs committee of the chambers of the U.S.S.R. Supreme Soviet. My colleague will give you an account of that meeting and of the well-known personalities
from the Soviet side who took part in that
discussion.
I must inform honourable senators that it
was agreed between ourselves when we left
Canada that the responsibility of launching
the discussion on the Canadian side at the
different meetings was to be shared by all
members of the delegation, and since my colleagues will no doubt remain silent about
their participation and the merit that should
be accorded them-and you know them as
well as I do-I am very proud indeed to
report to you that they discharged their
responsibilities in a manner that brings credit
to the Senate and to Canada.
On Wednesday afternoon we had a lengthy
and very useful discussion, I am convinced,
with a group of senior officials in charge of
hockey activities in the U.S.S.R., Messrs.

February 4, 1970

SENATE DEBATES

Ivonin, Mossolov and Starovoitov. I must say
that in Moscow, as in Canada before we left,
a great deal of interest has been aroused following the withdrawal of the Canadian
hockey team from thé 1970 tournament which
was to have been held in Montreal and
Winnipeg.
We believe that our discussions with them
have helped to clear up certain misunderstandings. Here again I must stress the fact
that before we left Canada, knowing that this
was a matter of mutual interest between the
two countries, we were very thoroughly
briefed on the problems involved in these
hockey discussions. I wish to state also that
at the start of the meeting we made it
perfectly clear that the four Canadian delegates were endorsing 100 per cent the stand
taken by the Canadian hockey organization in
its decision to withdraw from the 1970 tournament. Nevertheless, the Russian officials
expressed the hope that until the matters
affecting professionalism have been cleared
by the Olympic Hockey Organization that it
should be possible for Canada and Russia to
play exhibition games in 1971, whether in
Canada or in Russia.
On Wednesday evening, January 14, we left
Moscow by train for Leningrad where we
were met at the station on Thursday morning
by the Deputy Mayor, Mr. M. E. Togolev. At
11 o'clock we had a lengthy meeting with the
mayor of Leningrad, Mr. A. A. Sizov, a hero
of the last war, his deputy mayor and other
members of the Supreme Soviet. We were told,
of course, of the incredible siege of Leningrad
by the Germans, which lasted 900 days and
was probably the longest in history. In the
afternoon we were shown a documentary film
entitled "The Feat of Leningrad-900 Days of
Suffering, Heroism and Death", a film which
left us almost speechless. Later, in memory of
the two million men, women and children
who died during the siege, we visited the
memorial cemetery of Piskarewskoye where
we laid a wreath in the name of Canada on
the tomb of the unknown soldier.
Leningrad has recovered from nearly total
destruction, and is now probably one of the
loveliest cities in the U.S.S.R. As a matter of
interest, the city is keeping in its records an
invitation card addressed by Der Fuehrer
Adolf Hitler to a group of distinguished
guests to celebrate the capture of Leningrad
in the very hotel where we were located
during our stay in that city. Needless to say,
the celebrations never materialized.

My colleagues will no doubt wish to comment on a very informative and interesting
visit we made to the Arctic and Antarctic
Institute of the U.S.S.R. Academy of Sciences,
a visit which reminds us that Russia is our
immediate neighbour to the north. We could
not fail to be impressed by the magnitude of
the installations and research done by the
Soviets in this part of the world. The City of
Leningrad, having been mostly destroyed
during the siege, has a program of housing
construction underway and we visited a
prefabricated house-building factory, details
of which may be given to you in the course of
this debate. It is interesting to mention in
passing that until the construction program
meets the demand, it is not possible for a
citizen of the U.S.S.R. to move into the City
of Leningrad without a permit from the
authorities.
Another visit of interest in Leningrad, perhaps the most interesting from a tourist point
of view, was to the Hermitage. Before my
visit to the U.S.S.R. I had often heard of this
incredible museum. Though we had only a
glance at it for a few hours, it was enough for
us to appreciate that it ranks, at least in area
and the variety of its treasures and exhibits,
with the greatest museums in the world.
On Friday evening, January 16, we left
Leningrad for Kiev, the capital of the
Ukrainian Republic, where we landed late in
the evening to be greeted by Mr. S. O. Stetzensko, First Deputy Chairman of the
Presidium.
On Saturday morning we had a lengthy but
interesting meeting with our host, accompanied by officials of the presidium. We
praised the tremendous contribution of
Canadians of Ukrainian descent in every
walk of Canadian life; we praised also the
fact that in Canada there is no melting pot of
nations but, rather, a mosaic in which each
ethnic group is encouraged to retain and
develop its cultural traditions.
We had an absorbing sightseeing tour of
Kiev, with its historical museums, and the
visit to the Ukrainian Scientific Research
Institute of the super-hard material and
instruments deserves to be explained in a further report by one of my colleagues.
We saw in the Ukrainian Republic one of
the most amazing performances at the Shevchenko Opera and Ballet theatre, which
reflects only one facet of the importance
given in this country to culture and the arts.
On Sunday, January 18 we left for Yerevan, the capital of the Armenian Republic.

SENATE DEBATES
Our visit to this, the oldest city in the world,
dating back 2,750 years, would take many
hours to describe.
The Armenians were victims of genocide in
1915, perpetrated by the Germans and the
Turks, and more than one million were killed
or had to leave their country, scattering all
around the world. Since the last war they
have been returning in force to their old
country, and Yerevan is now a centre of
scientific research and one of the most
progressive republics in the U.S.S.R.
A visit to the Matenadaran Institute permits
one to see the most ancient manuscripts in
the world. We also visited one of the oldest
cathedrals in the world, a church as well as a
museum, built in the fourth century, where
the head of the Orthodox Church, His Holiness Vasgen I, resides. We were accorded the
privilege of a very warm reception at his
residence and this, no doubt, was one of the
highlights of our visit in Yerevan.
The meeting we had in Yerevan with the
Chairman of the Supreme Soviet of the
Armenian SSR will no doubt be commented
upon by one of my colleagues. The only
remark I wish to make about this leader is
that he was one of the most impressive personalities we met in the course of our
meetings.
We left Yerevan on Tuesday, January 20,
for Moscow where during the last day of our
stay in the U.S.S.R. we were to have the
most important meeting of this trip. January
20 was my last day of activity before I was
forced to take to my bed with bronchitis and
a high fever. The last meeting I attended was
with the Minister of Culture of the U.S.S.R.,
Mrs. E. A. Furtseva. I do not have the time
here to report on this meeting, but honourable senators will permit me to mention that,
as far as I remember, she is not only a very
talented minister but also a very charming
lady; and, in all fairness to Mrs. Furtseva, I
must say that she was in no way responsible
for the fever which struck me down after
meeting with her.

February 4, 1970

ter of Foreign Affairs; Mr. Kuzmin, the
Deputy Minister of Foreign Trade, Science
and Technology; Mr. Tikhomirov, the Committee Vice-Chairman; Mr. Polyansky, the
First Deputy Prime Minister; and the Acting
President, Mr. Lyashko.
These meetings extended well beyond the
usual limited parliamentary circles, and in
most embassies in Moscow the hospitality and
welcome given the Canadian delegation was
exceptional, and was surely intended to
underline the importance
the U.S.S.R.
attaches to the development of good relations
with Canada.
I was absent, of course, from the talks in
Moscow during the last days of the trip, but I
have nothing but praise for my three colleagues, the honourable Senators Connolly
(Ottawa West), Flynn, and Aird for their
magnificent efforts in making this goodwill
mission a complete success. They had the
opportunity of exploring at the highest level
the Soviet thinking in several fields, particularly those of trade, scientific and cultural
exchanges, peace moves, and European
security. It will be most interesting to hear
from them on these issues.
At the farewell dinner in Moscow, Senator
Connolly, on behalf of the Canadian Government, extended to officials of the U.S.S.R. an
official invitation to visit Canada. And we
hope that this visit will take place in the
coming year.
We left Moscow on Friday, January 23, for
London. Fortunately, I was in sufficiently
good health to leave with my colleagues.
Before turning the page on Moscow may I be
permitted, on behalf of my colleagues, to
express to the group of important officials of
the U.S.S.R. who accompanied us during the
whole trip a word of appreciation for their
assistance.

February 4, 1970

SENATE DEBATES

also the interpreters who were on the job
during the entire trip, and who often had to
perform the difficult task of translating our
conversation while eating.
Honourable senators, I want to impress
upon you the importance placed upon this
trip by all the foreign embassies in Moscow,
and by our friends in Great Britain.
Upon our return to London we were invited
by the Lord Chancellor, the Right Honourable
Lord Gardiner, to a meeting and dinner on
Monday, January 26, with a group of
important parliamentarians of both houses of
Parliament, which included Lord Shackleton,
Lord Privy Seal and the Leader of the House;
Sir David Stephens, Clerk of the Parliaments;
Sir Denis Dobson, Permanent Secretary to the
Lord Chancellor; Sir Alec Douglas-Home,
former Prime Minister of Great Britain; Lord
Byers, O.B.E.; the Right Honourable Arthur
Bottomley, O.B.E.; and Mr. Bryant Irvine,
M.P. for a Sussex division, who, by the way,
was born in Toronto. They were most anxious
to learn of our impressions of this trip, and
we were grateful to Lord Gardiner for this
opportunity to meet with such outstanding
parliamentarians of the Commonwealth.
Honourable senators, I cannot resume my
seat without again mentioning the outstanding performance during this trip of my three
honourable colleagues, who before and during
Christmas recess devoted much time to personal research and homework so as to be well
prepared for these discussions.
Lastly, may I say a word about the wives. I
must say in all frankness that over the years
I was one who was reluctant to have wives
accompany parliamentarians abroad. I do not
know if I am getting old, but I must confess
that today I have changed my mind. They
were officially invited by His Excellency the
Russian Ambassador in Ottawa, and if ever
there was a delegation when the wives should
accompany their husbands, in my opinion it
was this delegation. A special program of
activities was organized on their behalf. They
represented well the charm, simplicity and
glamour of Canadian women and should
share in the credit to Canada arising out of
the success of this trip.
As to my personal impressions, it is evident
that basic and fundamental ideological differences exist between our two countries, but I
am of the opinion that time is working slowly
but surely towards a reduction of this ideological gap between us. I would think that
through continued exchanges and dialogue we
can work for a better understanding, to the

benefit not only our two countries but the
peace of the world.
The Hon. the Speaker resumed the Chair.
Hon. John J. Connolly: Honourable senators,
I should like to be very closely associated
with everything that honourable Senator Deschatelets has said, especially his references to
the people we visited in Moscow and the
other parts of the Soviet Union, and to the
very great contribution made to the work
we had to undertake by the ladies who
accompanied their husbands.
After honourable Senator Deschatelets'
most impressive performance this afternoon I
rather think the Senate has come to the conclusion that while it has gained a good Speaker it has lost a very impressive orator and a
very impressive parliamentarian. It was a
pleasure, and indeed an honour, for all of us to
have been led by Senator Deschatelets on the
important mission which he outlined today.
There is bound to be a certain amount of
overlap in the reports that are made, but I
hope I can keep mine to a minimum. I think
the first question we all asked ourselves was,
"How significant is this visit for Canada?" We
severally came to the conclusion that we
should take it very seriously, at its face value,
for the purpose of opening a dialogue in sincerity between the two countries and their
leaders, and that for our part we should go
there to learn what we could, to seek co-operation in areas where co-operation was possible, with the ultimate objective of promoting
peace in our time and peace for all time in
the world.
How significant was this visit for the
U.S.S.R.? I think Mr. Speaker has already
indicated that. We saw four ministers, we met
the Committee on Foreign Affairs, the Committee on Science and Technology, the
Deputy Minister of Trade and five of his officials, and we had discussions with the Hockey
Federation. In all of these meetings there was,
as Senator Deschatelets said, a warmth, a
friendship and a sense of hospitality extended. I would not wish honourable senators to
think for a moment that there were not some
very hard facts put into the agenda and discussed at length.
I would say, in the second place, that if the
earlier parliamentary visit was a beginning,
our visit was in a way a continuation of the
kind of relationships which we must have
with the U.S.S.R.
As the honourable the Speaker has indicated, our program was very diversified and the

SENATE DEBATES

travel was exhausting. As he indicated, we
visited three of the fifteen republics. Leningrad, Kiev and Yerevan were the three stopping places. He indicated, too, that we saw
the chairman and deputy chairman of the
Supreme Soviet of each one of the republics.
We had not short perfunctory discussions but
long hours of talk in each case. We found the
men with whom we were talking, and particularly the chairmen, able and impressive in
their command and knowledge of the territories for which they had responsibility.
I do not intend to repeat those remarks
which the honourable the Speaker has made
about Leningrad. It is a beautiful city. Called
the Venice of the North, it is the old historic
capital established by Peter the Great; and,
frankly, I am glad that I visited it in winter.
I will pass over, too, the visit which was
made to the memorial cemetery which
enshrines the heroism of the people of Leningrad during the 900-day siege. I will pass over
the visit to the fabulous Hermitage, except to
say that I hope that in future exchanges
between Canada and the U.S.S.R., they will
show some of the great masterpieces which
are part of the fabric of their history, when
they send pictures here. The very existence of
the Hermitage indicates the interest of the
Russian people through the centuries in great
art.
I shall not discuss the visit we made to the
prefabricated housing plants, but I wish to
indicate that a housing problem of very
gigantic proportions confronts the Russian
authorities and they are coping with it as
earnestly as they can.
I should, however, like to mention our visit
to the Arctic Institute, which was supervised
and led by Dr. Alex Balakshin. He spoke of
the exchanges between Canada and U.S.S.R.
in relation to the development of the northern
parts of North America on the one hand and
Europe and Asia on the other. We have much
to learn from the Russian experience there.
They have cities-great cities, industrial
cities, built in the north, built on the permafrost. They have pipelines, mineral explorations meteorological works, not only on land
but floating on the sea. They have navigational problems. They have a coastline of 11,000
miles which is navigable, and only 3,000 of
those miles are icebound. They were very
interested in the Manhattan project. They
talked about the visit a few years ago of the
Honourable Arthur Laing and his associates
when he was Minister of Northern Affairs.
They were very glad that he had gone
[Hon. Mr. Connolly

(Ottawa West).]

February 4, 1970

into Siberia to see some of the development there. It made us feel that it would have
been beneficial if we had had the time and
the opportunity to do likewise. Perhaps
another Canadian delegation will do so.
As the Honourable the Speaker has said, we
were in Kiev, the capital of the Ukraine. The
Ukraine, as everyone knows, is the breadbasket of Europe, but it is also a great industrial area. As Mr. Speaker said, we talked
much about the Ukrainian community in
Canada and the strength it gave to the institutions which Canada is developing.
I should particularly mention the fact that
we said one of our colleagues, Senator Yuzyk,
was one of the distinguished members of the
Ukrainian community in Canada and a great
scholar; and that we have had others, including the late Senator John Hnatyshyn and the
late Senator William Wall. We told them, too,
of the Ukrainian contribution to other parts
of the public sector in Canada, in the courts,
on the Bench, in business and in the universities. We did not fail for a moment to impress
upon them the warmth and the attachment of
the Ukrainian Canadians to their fatherland
and indeed to the philosophy and the poetry
which has been expressed by their two great
men, particularly Shevchenko and Franko.
We then visited Yerevan, in Armenia, which
claims to be the oldest city in the world.
Probably, at 2,700 years of age, it is not as old
as Jerusalem or Damascus or some other
cities. It lies in the shadow of Mount Ararat,
where it is said the Ark of Noah rested after
the Deluge. It could well be the cradle of the
reborn human race.
At the Matenadaran, as Mr. Speaker, said,
we saw the earliest title deeds of civilization,
both pre-Christian and Christian. We saw the
same repeated at the Armenian Orthodox
cathedral Echmiadzin, where below the main
altar of the orthodox church, the archeologists have uncovered a firepot which was the
altar of a pagan church built upon the same
site in pre-Christian days.
Our visit to the Catholicus, His Holiness
Vasgen I, as Mr. Speaker has said, was an
impressive experience. I think the problems
he has will become clearer if I say to you that
the population of Armenia is about two and
one-third millions and the Catholicus, the
head of the orthodox church there, has no
more than about 150 clergy to service those
people in his work.
There will be much heard from the
archeologists in the years to come about
Armenia. Interest in archaeology in that

February 4, 1970

SENATE DEBATES

country has been very great for many years,
but there is still very much to do.
The thing that strikes one about Yerevan,
and perhaps about Armenia generally, is that
it is a place of great contrasts. It has its very
ancient archaeological aspect and yet centered
in that town is a university, a technical
school, a centre where they manufacture computers, and an industry where they manufacture precision instruments. No matter where
you go in the city-and the city is built on
more hills than is Rome-everywhere the
horizon is cluttered with cranes, indicating a
rebuilding of the city and an expansion of the
city. Practically every street is torn up,
indicating that modern services of water,
sewerage and power are being installed.
Honourable senators, I repeat these items
that have been already mentioned by Mr.
Speaker because I think they are part, if only
a very small part, of a mosaic of a giant
country that bas great economic potential.
Mr. Poliansky said to us that Canada's
natural wealth is second only to Russia's and
that Russia stands No. 1 in this field. It is a
country, too, of great military might, and it is
a country of impressive space achievements.
But I think if I were asked what the outstanding general impression was that I carried away with me, I would have to say that
it is politically very much of a monolithic
society. True, there is racial and linguistic
diversity far beyond the racial and linguistic
diversity we have in this country. But it was
quite evident to me that the Supreme Soviets
in the states that we visited are very closely
tied in with the Supreme Soviet of the
U.S.S.R. The power of that country-and this
is no news to honourable senators-is in the
Presidium of the Supreme Soviet in Moscow,
of which Mr. Podgorny is the Head of State
and Mr. Kosygin is the Prime Minister, and,
undoubtedly, in the Politburo in which Mr.
Brezhnev is the Secretary.
Certain delegations of power and responsibility have been granted by the central
authority to the Supreme Soviets of the 15
Republics, but I would say that the nerve
centre is undoubtedly the Kremlin. There
policy is set in the field of international
affairs, in matters dealing with war and
peace, in matters dealing with economics,
with culture, with science, and with technology. And, symbolic of it all, there, too, in the
Kremlin, is the tomb of Lenin, where every
day that it is opened-and that is nearly
every day of the week-literally thousands of
people line the streets for three or four

blocks, four abreast, to visit the tomb. It is
particularly noticeable that the influence of
Lenin is very deep in this country this year
when they are celebrating the 100th anniversary of his birth. One may disagree profoundly with the philosophy and indeed with the
methods of the U.S.S.R., but one must recognize, and the world is confronted with the
fact, that this country is only 50 years old,
and, although 24 of those years, so they claim,
have been wasted in war, nevertheless it is
still a viable, powerful country.
In Moscow, as Mr. Speaker bas said, we
saw Mr. Liashko, the Vice-President of the
Supreme Soviet. He is also Chairman of the
Supreme Soviet of the Ukraine. He was deputizing for Mr. Kosygin who was absent. Our
visit with him was a protocol visit, but it was
a very friendly one.
On the last evening, when they entertained
the Canadian delegation at dinner in the
Kremlin, Mr. Liashko did us the honour of
attending.
As Mr. Speaker bas said, we had discussions with Mr. Gromyko, Mr. Poliansky and
Madame Furtseva. I consider it a compliment
to Canada and to the importance that the
authorities in Russia attach to Canada that
four important ministers welcomed us to their
offices. Perhaps honourable senators would be
interested to know that each of these interviews occupied about two hours; some were
longer. I must say that there was no reluctance on their part to discuss any issue that
was raised.
I should like to devote myself particularly
to the problem of war and peace, as the discussion emerged in these various interviews.
First of all I should like to say that all of
them attach great importance to the proposed
conference on what they describe as European security, and to which we continually
referred as the problem of disarmament in
Europe.
Mr. Gromyko spoke on this at length. Mr.
Poliansky said that it had the highest priority. Mr. Spirodonov and Mr. Paletzkis, to
whom Mr. Speaker bas referred, at a meeting
of the foreign affairs committee also gave it
great stress. One of the members of that committee, Mr. Yuzi Zhukov, a former correspondent in Paris for Izvestia talked with
some knowledge of the problems of Europe
and, incidentally, also of the problems of the
developing world. On the developing world,
the aspect which he touched was done in a
manner that would commend itself to Canadians in respect to the problem of aid.

SENATE DEBATES
All three ministers who discussed the problem of European disarmament said that the
agenda for the conference should be realistic;
it should not be overburdened. As Mr.
Gromyko said, it should not be doomed before
it starts by having too much in it.
Mr. Poliansky said his view was that the
conference should be approached with a businesslike attitude.
The question we asked was who the participants in their view should be, and they
immediately said, of course, the NATO countries, the Warsaw Pact countries and the neutrals. I remember Senator Aird asking what
response had been received from the neutrals
about the conference, and Mr. Gromyko said
that already the replies were positive; there
were no negative replies, but that the neutrals did not like to see a block approach at
this conference. Mr. Gromyko also talked
about the American position and attitude
towards the conference, and he expressed the
hope that the United States would respond
positively. He said that he felt that the
Warsaw Pact countries hoped that the United
States would participate fully. He asked us if
we had any information as to why the United
States appeared to be reluctant. We had to
say to him, as we had to say on one or two
other occasions, that we could not speak for
the United States.
Opinions have been expressed about this
conference, and the question has been asked
whether it is designed to assure the Kremlin's
suzerainty in central and eastern Europe. Mr.
Gromyko on this point, although it was not
put to him quite that way, emphasized that
at this conference the U.S.S.R. was not seeking political dividends; it was seeking only to
reduce tensions in Europe and in the world,
and that he wanted this fact known. He also
expressed the view that Canada should participate fully.
He expressed pleasure also in the fact that
a Canadian foreign policy had been emerging
over the years which was independent and
positive. Mr. Poliansky on this subject was
rather interesting. He said that Canada must
take its place in the international community.
He said further that the weight and importance of Canadian foreign policy was continually increasing, and he thought that Canada
could do much at the proposed conference.
That was the view expressed on the Russian
side of the table.
In response our delegation indicated that
Canada was anxious to see disarmament
achieved at the earliest possible moment, that
[Hon. Mr. Connolly

(Ottawa West).]

February 4, 1970

Canada would also do all it could to assist in
this work and, it necessary, would become an
honest broker in respect of the work as
between the big powers. I should interject
here that when that aspect of the discussion
was mentioned, Mr. Poliansky disagreed and
said that Canada should not be attempting to
mediate but should be leading in giving a
positive thrust to the work that was being
done. However, honourable senators, we did
say that, without minimizing Canada's role or
France's role or the role of the United Kingdom, ultimately the problem of disarmament
in Europe depends upon the two giants who
are involved, namely, the United States and
the U.S.S.R. We said that in our view disarmament involved a phased reduction in
atomic and conventional weapons and troops,
that this should take place over a specified
period, and that there should be mutual
inspection inspired by mutual confidence. We
reminded him, as we reminded ourselves and
as I now remind the Senate, that we live
today not in a capitalist world or in a communist world but in a nuclear world. We said
more than once to the leaders in the U.S.S.R.
whom we had the privilege to meet, that the
giants in the power-field have first of all the
great responsibility for war or peace, but that
they also have the great opportunity. One of
their greatest atomic scientists, Andrey Sakharov has said that "unless the great nations
act promptly and together, there will be no
future."
We told these gentlemen that Canada and
other countries of our size view with alarm
the build-up on both the Warsaw Pact and
the NATO sides of Europe, and that at times
we feel like helpless spectators who are wondering how close to the brink the world is
going to go. We said that we doubted that a
nation of twenty million people, without goodwill on the part of the great powers, could
seriously influence the foreign policy in
respect of war or peace of the 220 million
people who live to our south or the 230 million people who live to our north, especially
when both of them are atomic powers.
I should say also, honourable senators, that
we did not hesitate to raise the question of
Hungary and of Czechoslovakia and to say
that Canadians viewed the crises in those two
countries with very deep concern. We also
said that we viewed with alarm the build-up
of power in the Mediterranean, in the Middle
East and in the Far East.
On the question of Czechoslovakia, when
this point was raised with Madame Furtseva,

February 4, 1970

SENATE DEBATES

she replied with candour and, indeed, with
indignation. This indignation was not directed
towards Canada, but she was quite emotional
about the fact that the U.S.S.R. had suffered
too much in war to allow its security to be
imperilled by something which might happen
i Czechoslovakia. To this we replied that the
Canadian attachment to free institutions led
us to believe that their preservation lessens
tensions and increases security even on the
flanks or in the buffer states, and that the
aphorism that "might is right" is not an
objective aphorism. I very much doubt that
Madame Furtseva was convinced by what we
said.
The same point arose in our discussion with
Mr. Gromyko. He was very quiet about it. He
said the West did not really understand the
real situation in Czechoslovakia or in the
U.S.S.R. He said the U.S.S.R.'s appreciation
and action was more objective than the attitude taken by the West and that there was
now no trouble in Czechoslovakia. Of course,
there is now no trouble in Czechoslovakia,
because the armed forces of the U.S.S.R. will
countenance no trouble.
It was I who raised this question with Mr.
Gromyko, and it was suggested to me by one
of his very important aides that it was
unfortunate I had raised it. I did not feel
that way. Frankly, I do not think Mr.
Gromyko felt that way.
Mr. Poliansky, a very outgoing and attractive man, bas been to Canada and bas visited
a number of our provinces. He spoke of the
good relations between Canada and the
U.S.S.R. He spoke too of the prospects of
better relations. He pointed out that there
were no points of dispute between us, and he
said-I think in candour-you are welcome
to your good relationships with the United
States, but try to develop better relations
with your northern neighbours. I quote him
directly as saying, "Visits like this are of
tremendous significance and use. They will
help find solutions to the problems which
beset us."
Honourable senators, what about the reduction of European tensions? Will there be a
cut-back, or will we continue to see the buildup of military capacity? Some apprebension
has been expressed in other parts of Europe
that, until European economie strength is
made firmer and the unity of western Europe
is more closely integrated, disarmament conferences should not take place.

My own view-and I am sure this is shared
by honourable senators-is that the two
objectives of greater European economic
development and of disarmament are not
mutually exclusive. I believe both goals can
be pursued simultaneously. As I see it, there
is no inconsistency between greater western
economic strength and the need to provide for
peace and disarmament.
Perhaps I should say too that Canada
may enjoy the confidence of the Russian leaders more than Canadians appreciate. Perhaps
we can do as much for peace as Mr. Gromyko
and Mr. Poliansky suggest. But even if we
cannot do all that they say, I think we should
try to help.
In our discussions the question of ideological differences did not arise. I must say that I
did not feel I was subjected to a propaganda
exercise. The ideological differences were
mentioned neither in public nor in private
discussion, but the fact of the matter is, and I
think the parties on both sides realized, that
the two philosophies of society in our two
countries are poles apart. We believe in the
freedoms of the democratic state, in private
enterprise, and that it is based upon the
Judeo-Christian ethic.
It is a fact too that the East is the East, that
it is Slavic, that emotion enters greatly into
its decision-making, and that it has a
mystique.
I may be wrong in this analysis, but I think
that this mystique could have been transformed from the mystique of the old Orthodox Church to the materialistic statehood of
Leninism, aided and abetted, of course, by the
dialectic materialism of Marx and Engels
upon which Lenin's work was based. To
understand the U.S.S.R. and its beginnings, a
knowledge of Russian history is essential.
There is no doubt that the leaders of the
U.S.S.R. emphasize the importance of the sacrifice to be made by the individual citizen in
the interests of the state. So far as we could
see-from the cities we visited, from the
people we saw, from the evidence we heardpeople are sacrificing. But spirituality, as we
define it, plays little part in the national life
of that country. Intellectuality, yes. Among
its political leaders are some of the great
intellects in the U.S.S.R. Journalists, writers
and poets are in places of influence, and there
have been great cultural achievements in the
performing arts, literature and science, but
the churches are museums.

SENATE DEBATES
I would like to pay particular tribute ta Mr.
Kosevnikov and to his wife, both of whom
accompanied us and to whom the Speaker has
referred. I think that Mr. Kosevnikov is one
of the leading intellectuals of the country; he
is certainly an impressive man. He has two
daughters who are extremely talented-one a
pianist and the other a composer at 16 years
of age. One of her works was performed in
Moscow for the first time by a great artist.
Unfortunately, her parents were unable to
attend the performance because they were
with us.
Honourable senators, I repeat that we were
in another world. Canada and the U.S.S.R. in
many respects are two worlds; they are poles
apart. Can they co-exist? Can they co-operate?
These are pressing questions. Or, are we
faced with the alternative of mutual destruction? Is a holocaust inevitable?
On this point Sakharov knows what he is
talking about, because he had so much to do
with the invention and the development of
the hydrogen bomb. He said:
The preaching of the incompatability of
world ideologies is madness and a crime.
Only universal co-operation under conditions of intellectual freedom and lofty
moral ideals ... will preserve civilization.
We may in our generation see a closer
approach to the brink of the annihilation of
mankind before a better modus vivendi is
achieved. I hope that this will not occur.
Brinkmanship is a very hazardous exercise.
But, I am inclined to be optimistic.
Of this visit I should say that we were not
invited to Soviet Russia to become converts to
communism, and we did not go there in the
hope of making any of our hosts converts to
capitalism. Neither is likely to happen on the
large scale. But, with all the obstacles that
confront us, with all the frustrations, with all
the recriminations, with the determination on
both sides to look after its own interests, I
believe it is essential to attempt a detente
leading to a lasting and realistic peace. It is
essential to pursue this goal steadfastly,
patiently, with idealism, and with commitment. In my opinion it is worth persistent
determination to achieve so noble a goal.
The goal, of course, is a genuine transformation of the international structure to a
fraternal and co-operative world. If we are to
have this then we must have neighbours to
cherish, and not enemies to attack.
I think that we made many friends in the
Soviet Union, including friends in the minis[Hon. Mr. Connolly

(Ottawa West).]

February 4, 1970

try. All I can hope is that they will be motivated, as we are, by an idealistic desire, if
you will, a lofty idealism, to develop a lasting
peace in the world, not only for ourselves but
for our children.
Hon. John B. Aird: Honourable senators, at
the outset of my remarks I would like to
associate myself with the addresses made by
His Honour the Speaker and by Senator Connolly (Ottawa West). For me the visit to the
Soviet Union was a memorable one. A wonderful reception was given us and our wives
by our hosts, and we were shown generous
hospitality and kindness. Unfortunately,
because of the nature of this debate, I shall
probably repeat some of the things that have
been said by both Senator Deschatelets and
Senator Connolly, but I wish to record the
impressions that 1, as a parliamentarian,
received, and I hope that my words will
reflect my independent, reaction.
Let me emphasize that I do not regard
myself as an instant expert. By nature, I have
always regarded with suspicion anyone giving
a so-called eye witness account of any event
or procedure. This is particularly true of
what I have to say in this report. I believe it
was Blake who said that it is important to see
through the eye, and not with it. I shall
endeavour to follow his advice.
Therefore, honourable senators, I propose to
discuss our visit under four general headings:
strength and power, the east-west gap,
Canada's position vis-a-vis the Soviet Union,
and some general conclusions.
First, the overwhelming impression that I
have is one of the great strength and power
of the Soviet Union. Everywhere we went
there was evidence of dedication, devotion,
and sacrifice on behalf of the state. Everywhere the ravages of the war against Germany were still very much in evidence. Everywhere there was expressed the staggering
figure of at least 20 million Russians who had
been lost during that war. Everywhere it was
emphasized that the war had been fought on
the beloved soil of the Soviet Union, and that
no family had escaped unscathed.
As a result, I think it is fair to say that the
Soviet Union is still operating with a wartime
mentality, and that it is absolutely determined that never again will such a war be
fought on its soil.
Everywhere there is evidence of a continuing preparedness. It is well known that
Moscow itself is a city ringed with roads that
circle the city, and that every access roadway

February 4. 1970

SENATE DEBATES

and approach is clearly available for utilization as a military defence. The aircraft in
which we travelled are readily convertible to
military transports, and it is my understanding that all the pilots are drawn from the
ranks of the army.
There can be no doubt that the Russians
have excelled in certain areas, especially
those related to pure science, the aerospace
field, and medicine. We did not inspect a
great number of plants, but by Western
standards in those plants that we did see I
must be honest and say that their industry is
lagging. And what is more, they know it. It is
interesting to note that the plant managers in
several of the factories we visited were the
first to admit that there was a great deal of
room for improvement in productivity. It is
also interesting to note that they always
talked about increased plant production, as
contrasted to increased output per man hour
which, of course, is the true test of increased
effectiveness and productivity.
In Leningrad we visited a precast concrete
construction factory from where some of the
great apartment construction in Leningrad
was emanating. We were shown the computer
control of inventory, and we were also told
how it could be materially improved-and,
what is perhaps more important, that it
would be improved-and that next year the
plant was looking forward to a 20 per cent
increase in plant productivity. In similar fashion, we were shown an electric light factory
in far off Yerevan, in the Republic of
Armenia, wherein the same figures of plant
produc.ivity improvement were being sought,
and, interestingly enough, incentive pools of
capital had been created for workers showing
innovative talents.
Everywhere we went there was this emphasis on increased plant productivity. Everywhere we went there was evidence that the
equipment and methods were not comparable
to Canadian standards. But also everywhere
we went we were impressed by the drive,
determination and the sacrifices that the
workers in every echelon seemed prepared
to make in order better to serve their country.
There is no doubt that the Russians are
proud of their achievements, and if one wonders why the country is not a little bit more
prosperous and up to date, it must always be
remembered that it is endeavouring to remold
a nearly illiterate peasant nation into an
industrial society. It has had to cope with
two world wars, a civil war, the incredible
21498-31

days and rule of Stalin-whose name was not
mentioned once during our visit, but whose
picture as a very young man I saw at the
Smolny Palace in Leningrad as a member of
the revolutionary group-and the collective
agricultural system, which may or may not be
working efficiently. We had no opportunity to
make any judgment of the agricultural
system. In addition, at the present time the
Soviet Union is also in a defence and space
race with the United States.
May I say that I am indebted to John
Massey Stewart for his work "Across the
Russias", which bas given me some appreciation of these and other Russian problems.
Permit me to conclude this heading of
strength and power by saying that if effort,
dedication and sacrifice can overcome all
obstacles, then the citizens that we saw and
talked to are committed to this end.
My second heading, honourable senators, is
the East-West gap. We often think in terms of
military or economic areas when we think of
the East-West gap. I would like to speak to
you first of al in terms of freedom, religion
and humour.
You know, we Canadians do not think very
much about freedom. In fact, we take it for
granted. Not until a person is deprived of his
freedom does he have any understanding of
exactly what it means, and yet freedom is
something that Canadians have believed they
fought for valiantly in two world wars. It is
freedom that we should be most concerned
about today. Surveillance, secret police, the
continual necessity of the inspection of documents, the continual presence of unnamed
spectators at any event, clearly establishes
the mood and the atmosphere in which the
citizens of the Soviet Union exist today. The
feeling is something that must be experienced
in order to be fully comprehended.
It is often said that there is no religion in
the Soviet Union. Once again I suppose this
depends upon one's definition of religion. It so
happens that this is the centenary of Lenin's
birth, as Senator Connolly described, and
everywhere we went there were pictures and
busts of the Soviet Union's founding father. It
may have been said many times by many
others, but the state is the god of the people
and Lenin is the symbol of that deity. We
were privileged to visit his tomb in Red
Square, and at the time of our visit there was
a line-up of thousands who had been waiting
for hours in order to pass by the mausoleum
and express their silent reverence to him, and
of course indirectly to their state. I would like

SENATE DEBATES
to find the words to convey to you this feeling
of mystical reverence, dedication and sacrifice
for the state. The idea is conveyed that it all
began here, the feeling that this was the place
of origin, and that in effect Lenin, and the
Soviet Union, is the saviour of the world.
As you all know, the beautiful old churches
and palaces have, almost without exception,
been converted into museums and are used
for the purpose of showing to the people that
the riches formerly held by the feudal masters and the church are now, because of communism and the revolution, the property of
the people and of the state. The best example
of this, to my mind, is the incomparable Hermitage in Leningrad, which is the most magnificent display of art and culture that I have
seen anywhere. Every day thousands go
through the Hermitage to see these treasures
of the past, which the people are told now
belongs to them.
Let me turn to the subject of humour. It
may seem an odd heading after having discussed such other serious topics, but I believe
that it is very much in point because, in all
honesty, I must say that by western or
Canadian standards there seems to be an
extraordinary lack of it. I am indebted to the
writings of Malcolm Muggeridge on this subject. I agree with him that the test of any
civilization is the ability to laugh at itself,
and the ability to caricature itself. He says:
I would go further and contend that
the degree of health and civilization in
any society bears a direct relation to the
degree to which this principle operates.
As long as we can laugh at our aspirations, and at our disillusionments, at our
fears and our pretentions, and our vanities and our appetites; above all, at ourselves-there is still hope for us and for
the things that we hold dear.
I agree fully with these statements, as I
agree that it is the universality of humour
that makes it so sweet an alleviation of life's
bitterness. I suppose the rulers of the Soviet
Union have a full appreciation of what
humour really means. Humour only exists
in so far as it is truthful. To me, the
humour and caricature of Canada and the
western world is the very touchstone of the
things which we hold dear, because a cartoon
in a single expression of thought can reveal
with absolute clarity and incisive truth the
reality of any given situation. But to laugh is
to fundamentally criticize, and to criticize is
quite obviously forbidden in the Soviet
mion. Mr. Aird.]

February 4, 1970

Union, so I make this point as emphatically as
I can.
This is in no way a comment on the culture
that exists in the Soviet Union because,
believe me, there is almost a cult of culture.
We saw absolutely magnificent ballet, even to
my uneducated eye and ear, in the stunning
setting of the Kremlin Theatre, and in the
most impressive theatres in Leningrad and
Kiev. The disciplines in the arts are fully
developed and the results are truly outstanding. The desire to excel is everywhere selfevident and the results speak for themselves,
particularly in these fields. But as for
humour, by western standards it is simply not
present. And I say that if there is to be
honesty and truth in any civilization, then the
presence of humour as I have defined it is a
condition precedent to its healthy existence.
As I have endeavoured to indicate to you
by this brief discussion of such things as
power, strength, religion and humour, I
believe there is what seems to be an almost
unbridgeable gap between the western mind
and the Soviet mind. Not only do the Russians have 36 letters in their alphabet compared to our 26, but it seems to me that they
have a completely different vocabulary to go
with their alphabet.
In any event, they have an almost completely different way of life because today the
Soviet Union seems to be a closed economy
and certainly at the present time is very little
subject to any western influences. I could see
little evidence of any western news, any
western impact of change and evolution as we
understand it. This, to me, presents the fundamental question of our time: Can this gap
be closed? Can there be co-existence, or at
least co-operation? Surely communism, or for
that matter democracy, can only prevail and
exist if it is based on truth and in fair and
open competition with other methods of society. It may only be a pious hope, but let us
pray that some kind of a viable world society
may evolve from the two opposing systems.
We hear everyday talk of the generation
gap, the technological gap, the credibility
gap-but surely the gap between East and
West is the one that must command our every
effort because the very future of existence on
this planet depends upon it.
My third heading relates to Canada's position vis-a-vis the Soviet Union. Honourable
senators will be familiar with the stand I took
last April concerning the Governments decision relating to the phased reduction of our
NATO forces in Europe. I said that I simply

February 4.1970

SENATE DEBATES

did not believe that the decision was in the
best interests of the Canadian people. I do not
propose to dwell upon this Government decision other than to say that since that time
world events, and particularly those in the
Middle East and Czechoslovakia, seem to support my position. Today I am more convinced
than ever about the validity of my conclusion.
All my life I have been concerned with
strategy, with tactics-even though it may be
as an amateur-and it is clear that the strategy of the Soviet Union is one of strength. I
believe that the Russians respect and understand strength and commitment better than
anything else and that, if one is to deal with
them, one must move from strength-in this
case the collective security and strength of
NATO.
In our conversations with Mr. Polyansky,
First Deputy Prime Minister, I said that I
believed in capacity, whether it be the capacity of the Soviet Union or the United States,
and that for many reasons I did not place
much faith in intentions which can change
overnight-and often do! To me, the meeting
with Mr. Polyansky was extremely interesting
because he strongly made the point that he
believed that Canadian foreign policy was
becoming more independent and that Canada
occupies an important role in world affairs,
and that even though a small country in
population, a precise position-those were the
words he used, "a precise position"-by
which Canada would help in solving many
international problems.
Mr. Polyansky went on to discuss the
proposed conference on European security
which we previously had discussed at some
length with Mr. Gromyko, and he pointed out
that the interest of Canada and the United
States could ensure a good result. Mr. Gromyko had previously told us of his great satisfaction concerning our visit and had re-emphasized that the course of Soviet Union policy
was peace and detente, and he felt that the
proposal of the Warsaw Pact countries for a
European security conference would materially increase the prospects for world peace. He
reassured us that the Soviet Union sought no
unilateral gain and emphasized that the
agenda for such a conference should be very
carefully thought out, and that it should not
address questions which, to use his words,
"would break the back of such a conference".
Honourable senators, Mr. Gromyko talked
about balanced reductions of military forces,
but pointed out that this had to be connected
21498-31J

with other areas of discussion which were
inter-related. His emphasis was on the fact
that such a conference must address problems
which are soluble, and he gave two headings
for discussion at that meeting: firstly,
"Security in European countries and the
renunciation of force"; and, secondly, "Development of relations between Europeans on
the economic and technological and political
problems common to all countries."
At this meeting we discussed briefly what
he termed "The Czechoslovakian crisis of
August 1968". I found it interesting and
revealing when he said that different conceptions of the Czechoslovakian affair had no
doubt arisen because of the interpretation of
the word "freedom" and that it seemed to
him that some aspects of the Soviet Union's
move were not clear to some statesmen in the
West.
I take the liberty of referring you back
to my remarks about freedom.
In this same context, I was interested to
note that Mr. Gromyko said that although he
was extremely interested in economic and
bilateral ties between Canada and the Soviet
Union, he did not feel that a political relationship should necessarily be dependent
upon material facts such as imbalances in
trade-whereas, Mr. Polyanski emphasized
that it was most desirable that the ships carrying Canadian wheat to Russia should be
loaded on both sides.
This was further emphasized by Mr.
Kuzmin, First Vice-Minister of External
Trade, who later that day dwelt at length on
the imbalances of trade between Canada and
Russia. Mr. Kuzmin, in effect, challenged the
position that Canada is an open market and
indicated that experience had shown prejudice against Soviet sales in Canada. In particular, he referred to promotional efforts to
sell Soviet aircraft-and he made specific reference to helicopters-and the submission of
bids on power generators for Manitoba and
Saskatchewan as well as farm machinery for
the prairies. In effect, he suggested that if
Canada persists in this attitude of rejection,
the Soviet Union will buy elsewhere. You
will, therefore, see that the Soviet Union
adopts quite a different attitude from that of
other countries endeavouring to sell machinery and other goods in Canada. The Soviet
Union says that trade must be on the ground
of a country-to-country transaction rather
than on the ground of open competition in the
Canadian
free
enterprise
sophisticated
market. This obviously has very wide-

SENATE DEBATES
implications from a Canadian point of view,
and will be very difficult, if not impossible, to
implement.
Honourable senators, my general conclusion
is that the main thrust of our discussions with
the four important Soviet Union ministers
was toward, firstly, the Canadian position as
it relates to the proposed European security
conference which, as yet, has no date set;
secondly, the great desire of the Soviet Union
to improve its imbalance of trade with
Canada because of its large wheat purchases;
and, thirdly, any possible differential that
could be established between Canadian and
United States posture to world events and, of
course, particularly toward the Soviet Union.
These three subjects came up in nearly
every conference of importance. It is clear in
particular that the Soviet officials welcomed
any opinions, whether pro or con-and even
really quite subtly-concerning Canada's
position as it relates to the United States.
All in all, I would consider the visit a successful one, although difficult from a physical
point of view, inasmuch as we had an
extremely full program with many deadlines
to meet. On the other hand, the meetings
certainly served the purpose of establishing
the opening of a dialogue between parliamentarians of the Soviet Union and of Canada.
We had an opportunity to look at each other
across the table.
I believe that our delegation discharged its
task with dignity, despatch, and firmness if
the occasion demanded it. As I said at the
beginning, all the meetings and receptions
were held in a most cordial and hospitable
atmosphere. In fact, we could not have been
looked after in a better fashion.
I regard my own visit to the Soviet Union
as being rewarding and educational. In closing, I would like to say that we in Canada
have much to learn about the world; we have
much to learn about self-discipline; we have
a country of which we can be very proud and
wherein freedom prevails. At all costs it is
our duty to take every step to maintain that
freedom in the pursuit of peace. Such a peace
can only be achieved through awareness of
the strength and capacity of the superpowers
of the world.
As I said once before, to put the problem in
language that everyone understands, the
name of this serious and deadly game of
international relationships is still vigilance.
Hon. Jacques Flynn: Honourable senators, I
shall detain you only a few minutes longer
[Hon. Mr. Aird.1

February 4, 1970

and, to change the tempo, I will speak in
French.
[Translation]
Honourable senators, it did not seem essential to me that each member of the Senate
delegation which recently visited the USSR,
at the invitation of the Soviet ambassador in
Ottawa, submit a report to the Senate. However, I do not want to be the only remiss
delegate, even though I may repeat what you
have already heard more than once.
My general impressions of this trip are
most favourable. We were cordially welcomed, we had very pleasant experiences, and
at the same time we had opportunities to
learn much about the country and its
inhabitants.
It is impossible to come to very definite
conclusions and have clear impressions after
a stay of barely ten days in a country as vast
as the U.S.S.R., which, as you know, has a
population of over 250 millions, and is made
up of 15 republics over an area greater than
Canada itself. Spending a few days in
Moscow, Leningrad, Kiev, the Ukrainian capital, Yerevan, capital of Armenia, does not
make one an authority on the Soviet regime.
Nonetheless, the policy of exchange parliamentary visits seems an excellent one to me.
Understanding calls for communication and
more and more dialogues. The apparent uselessness of flrst contacts and flrst exchanges
should not prove discouraging. I do not say
this about our recent visit to Russia, but in
connection with the oft-heard criticisms about
alleged excessive travel by parliamentarians.
I have no intention of relating the events of
our ten-day trip and our numerous and continuous activities consisting in meetings with
the authorities, visits to historie sites,
museums and social gatherings. The previous
speakers have said enough about it. I shall
limit myself to a summary analysis of the
position and the general policy of the Soviet
government.
I agree with Senator Aird that two facts
seem to have a strong influence on the Soviet
people: first, the isolation into which the
system was thrown after the events of 1917
and until the war in 1939 and, second, the
heavy burden which the war put on the Soviets and the ensuing fear of another conflict.
There is no doubt that the isolation in
which the U.S.S.R. found herself after the
October revolution had a strong influence and
was the first reason behind the ideological
conflict between Marxist communism and the

February 4, 1970

SENATE DEBATES

so-called capitalist system. Both sides long
held to the view-which still prevails in many
quarters-that this ideological conflict could
not be resolved and end other than in a
war which would mean total victory for one
side or the other. Lenin had expressed this
view and the leaders of western nations have
also made similar statements before.
Yet, this confliet bas not materialized after
50 years, even if we did have a cold war and
if, according to many people, the cold war
still goes on. Nonetheless, the ideological confiet underwent profound changes because
there bas been a change in the approach by
both sides, the so-called capitalist or freeenterprise system and the Marxists. There
necessarily were exchange of views, discussions and clashes which to a certain extent
blunted some of the asperities in this ideological opposition. Furthermore, the spectre of a
nuclear war renders more and more obvious
the impossibility of settling this confliet by
force, as it is clear that an atomic war
would leave no victor and that in the end
such a war would put in balance the very
survival of the whole world.
It is therefore in this context that NATO
continues to seek an easing off of relationseven after the developments in Czechoslovakia-with the countries of the Warsaw
Pact and that the latter, for their part, multiply their efforts in order to have a panEuropean conference called for the purpose of
seeking a general agreement that force will
not be resorted to in the settlement of conflicts which are of concern to European
countries.
On the other hand, the painful experience
of the last war brought about a strengthening
of the Soviet system, as it fostered in the
people a very strong nationalist sentiment
and, by way of consequence, the determination to rebuild their war-torn territory and to
create, at the same time, a military force to
prevent the repetition of such a disaster.
On the economical and social levels, the
Soviet regime surely has successes to its
credit, but it is obvious that the standard of
living is still very low. On the other hand, the
military strength of the U.S.S.R. is well
known; its maintenance requires that the
people devote the major part of their efforts
to it, neglecting, by the same token, their
economie progress.
It appeared te me that the Soviets greatly
fear West Germany and even more the
United States of America. They doubt their

sincerity when they preach world peace. At
any rate, there is no doubt that the U.S.S.R.
is only willing to negotiate peacekeeping
conditions from a position of strength. It is
difficult to criticize them for this because it
bas always appeared essential that the West
proceed in the same way.
Moreover, that is the very reason why I
agree with those who, like Senator Aird, do
not accept that Canada should reduce its military participation in NATO. Disarmament
should only take place at the level of the two
alliances-NATO and the Warsaw Pact.
Because of its geographical position, Canada
cannot have a policy of its own or one that is
independent of that of its allies within NATO,
unless it renounces its responsibilities and
thereby weakens the alliance.
It is surely not by reducing our military
participation that we shall contribute to
easing the tension. This can only result, once
again, from negotiations at the level of the
two great alliances.
In conclusion, may I say that, upon my
return from the U.S.S.R., I am convinced that
that country sincerely desires peace, that a
dialogue is possible and that it should be
extended between our two countries as well
as between the East and the West. It remains
nevertheless extremely important that NATO
continue to neutralize the military power of
the U.S.S.R. for as long as we are unable to
agree on total disarmament.
As for the ideological conflict between
Marxism, on the one hand, and so-called capitalism, on the other, it is not about to be
solved. However, I do not consider it impossible that some evolution, which may not be
outwardly apparent but which is felt when
one travels in the U.S.S.R. may reduce its
sharpness in a not too distant future.

Honourable senators, to summarize, we had
a most enjoyable journey, though a very busy
one, for which I join my colleagues in thanking our hosts, and also our Ambassador in
Moscow, his charming wife and all the
staff of the Embassy. I assure our hosts and I
assure honourable senators that this journey
will have served the cause of international
peace and understanding, even if only in a
very modest way.

SENATE DEBATES
Canada requested Canadian banks and other
financial institutions not to extend credit on
gold nor to facilitate forward purchases of
gold.
(c) On January 21, 1968, the Bank of
Canada announced that, following discussions
with chartered banks, it had been agreed that
the banks should discourage the use of bank
credit to facilitate abnormal transfers of
funds abroad by Canadian subsidiaries of
foreign companies or to meet requirements in
Canada which had in the past normally been
met by parent companies. On the same day,
the Bank of Canada raised the Bank Rate
from 6 per cent to 7 per cent and, in the
subsequent period, pursued a policy that put
upward pressure on market interest rates and
thereby encouraged investors to keep their
funds in Canada and borrowers to bring
funds into Canada.
(d) At the end of January, 1968, the Bank
of Canada drew U.S. $250 million on its U.S.
$750 million reciprocal credit facility with the
Federal Reserve System.
(e) At the end of February, Canada drew
the equivalent of U.S. $426 million from the
International Monetary Fund.
(f) In early March, the Bank of Canada
asked the banks and other financial intermediaries not to facilitate the outflow of funds
through certain foreign currency deposit
transactions and this request was widened by
the Minister of Finance with an appeal which
included all investors.
(g) On March 7th, it was announced that,
following negotiations between Canadian and
United States authorities, the United States
had undertaken to exempt Canada completely
from U.S. balance of payment measures
affecting capital flows that were being administered by the U.S. Department of Commerce
or the Federal Reserve System. For its part,
Canada undertook to ensure that this exemption would not result in Canada being used as
a "pass-through" by which the purpose of the
U.S. balance of payment program would be
frustrated and guidelines were issued to
Canadian banks; non-bank financial institutions were asked in July to accept similar
guidelines. Also on March 7th, standby credits
amounting in total to $900 million from the
Export-Import Bank, from the Bank for International Settlements and, through it, the
central banks of Germany and Italy were
announced by the Minister of Finance and by
the Bank of Canada.

February 4, 1970

(h) On March 17th, the Bank of Canada
announced that it would co-operate with other
central banks in measures taken to stem the
drain on official gold reserves and to establish
a two-price system for gold. At the same
time, it announced an increase in the Bank
Rate from 7 per cent to 71 per cent and that
its reciprocal credit facility with the Federal
Reserve System was increased from U.S. $750
million to U.S. $1,000 million.
(i) To further encourage confidence in the
Canadian dollar and to hasten the rebuilding
of reserves, Government bonds payable in
foreign currencies and amounting in total te
some U.S. $262 million were issued in Germany, Italy and the United States in May and
June.
Question 4
What resources did the Bank of Canada
or the Government of Canada have available in January of 1967 and succeeding
months of 1967 and 1968 with which to
protect or maintain the purchasing or
exchange value of the Canadian money,
and how much of such resources was
used or expended for that purpose?
During 1967 and 1968 the Bank of Canada
and the Government of Canada had available
to support the foreign exchange value of the
Canadian dollar,
(a) the gold and U.S. dollars held by the
Exchange Fund Account, the Bank of Canada
and the Minister of Finance;
(b) Canada's drawing rights with the International Monetary Fund;
(c) the Bank of Canada's reciprocal swap
facility with the Federal Reserve System;
(d) Standby credit facilities arranged in
March 1968 with (i) the Export-Import Bank;
and (ii) Bank for International Settlements
and, through it, the central banks of Germany
and Italy;
(e) the proceeds of long-term foreign currency borrowings in Germany, Italy and the
United States referred to in paragraph (i)
above.
An indication of the net amount of
resources used to protect or maintain the
exchange value of the Canadian dollar during
each month of 1967 and 1968 is given in
accompanying Table II.

money in each of the months of the said

of such credits were used or called upon
for that purpose?

U.S. $262 million borrowed in Germany, Italy
and the United States, were called upon and

included in Canada's holdings of gold and
U.S. dollars. However, since the original holdings of the Exchange Fund Account were at
all times more than adequate to meet the
drains on reserves which occurred in 1967
and 1968, none of these credits was actually
used.

moved:
That the names of the honourable
Senators Quart and Welch be substituted
for those of the honourable Senators
Bélisie and Willis on the list of Senators

Motion agreed ta.
ADJOURNMENT
Han. A. Hamilton McDonald: Honourable
senators, with leave of the Senate, and notwithstanding Rule 45(l)(g), I move that when
the Senate adjourns today it do stand
adjourned until Tuesday next, February 10,
at 8 o'clock in the evening.
Hon. J. Campbell Haig: Honourable senators, I do not know whether the Leader of the
Governmnent or the Government Whip know
that members of the United States Committee
on Science and Astronautics are arriving here
fromn Washington on Sunday afternoon and
that they will be introduced ta the House of
Commons at 2 p.m. on Monday. As they will
not be leaving Ottawa until Tuesday afternoon, I was wondering whether the Leader of
the Government would agree ta having the
Senate meet at 2 p.m. that day sa that these
visitons could be intnoduced here. The Senate
could resume its sitting at 8 o'clock in the
evenrng.
The Hon. thxe Speaker: With your permission, honounable senators, I do not wish ta go

into the details of the merits of this motion,
but I should say that 1 have been asked to
organize a luncheon in the Speaker's chambers at noon on Tuesday next for the Amenican delegates. This I have agreed to do with
great pleasure. H-aving said that I will leave it
to the honourable Leader of the Government
to answer the honourable Senator Haig's
question.
Hon. Paul Martin: May I ask Senator Haig
if this congressional. committee will be here
on Wednesday?
Hon. Mr. Haig: No.
Hon. Mr. Martin: The timetable for next
week has been arranged with the work that is
to corne before this house in mind. At this
stage I do flot think it possible for us to meet
earlier than Tuesday evening. Next week's
work is planned in the light of the programn
now in our hands. This means that we have
no occasion to meet on Tuesday afternoon.

EXPENDITURES-APPLICATION
OF RULE 84

Leave having been given
Reports of Committees:

ta

revert; ta

Hon. Hariland de M. Maison: Honourable
senators, I have been asked to cail the attention of the bouse to a problem that faces us
from time to time, and which concerns the
planning and control of our own expenditures, with particular reference to oui
committees.
We are ail well aware of the fact that a
great deal more committee work is being
done now than in the past, and we are equally aware that some of this work is of the
highest importance. To enable them to carry
out their tasks the committees have, quite
rightly, acquired additional and, in many
cases, expert staff, and they have been
authorized by the Senate to incur the necessary expenses. In the Standing Committee on
Internai Economy and Contingent Accounts,
of which Senator Smith is the Chairman, it
was agreed that budgets would be submitted
for future planned expenditures. A second
way in which the matter of these expenditures was examined, and more my direct concern as its chairman, was in the Standing
Committee on Standing Rules and Orders.
That inatter was deait with and discussed at

SENATE DEBATES
some length over a year ago. The result was
that Rule 84 emerged. I shall not read Rule
84, which has four sub-rules, but in short it
says that a Senate committee shall report its
expenditures after a period when it has finished its job. I call attention to sub-rule (3),
which reads:
In addition to the final report referred
to in sub-rules (1) and (2), within fifteen
days of the commencement of each session, a select committee of the Senate
shall make an interim report of any special expenses incurred by it during the
preceding session which have been
accounted for, together with an estimate
of any such expenses not yet accounted
for.
To my knowledge I do not believe that
there has been any such report submitted to
the chamber. Having been asked to call this
to the attention of the chamber, I would
respectfully suggest that the chairmen of
committees examine their own situation and
see whether or not they have complied with
Rule 84.
Hon. Donald Smith: Honourable senators,
may I respond to the point raised by honourable Senator Molson? The honourable senator
cited Rule 84, which applies to the operation
of the Senate, and it was therefore quite
proper for him to raise this matter in the
chamber.
It might be helpful, in order to see whether
or not the new rule can be more closely
adhered to in future, if as chairman of the
Standing Committee on Internal Economy and
Contingent Accounts I took it upon myself to
see that Senator Molson's remarks, and the
application in general of Rule 84, are brought
to the attention of all committees, both the
standing and the special committees. We
should thank the honourable senator for
bringing to our attention the particular provision in Rule 84 which he quoted.
PRIVATE BILL
BRUNNER

CORPORATION (CANADA)
-SECOND READING

LIMITED

Hon. Daniel A. Lang moved the second
reading of Bill S-18, respecting Brunner Corporation (Canada) Limited.
He said: Honourable senators, this is a private bill, which might very well be considered as a routine and rather uninteresting
piece of legislation. However, I assure those
of my colleagues who are members of the
[Hon. Mr. Molson.]

February 5, 1970

legal profession feel it is of considerable
interest to them. I can only paraphrase my
recollection of the remarks of, I think it was
Talleyrand, which he made on one occasion
when he was briefing some of his public servants. As we know, probably one of the greatest public services of any country was built
up in France under Talleyrand. I paraphrase
his remarks: "You will service your country
well. I have confidence in your merit and
devotion, but one fault I will not tolerate is
zeal."
Honourable senators, in this private bill
which we have before us this afternoon we
have an example of what zeal can do when
carried to its extreme or exhibi'ed whatsoever by our public servants. Today, in the
atmosphere in which we now find ourselves
in Parliament, I really feel that one of the
most important responsibilities we have in
this body is to watch and guard against zeal
exhibited in our public service. This zeal is
not only contrary to the rule of law, but
rather ascribing to it, and carries itself
beyond the spirit of the law.
Honourable senators, this company was
incorporated in 1937 by a federal charter, and
from that date until 1962 it carried on the
business of manufacturing air compressors,
condenser units and pumps in its plant in
Port Hope, Ontario. During this period it was
a wholly-owned subsidiary of an American
company, Dunham-Bush, Inc., which had its
head office in Hartford, Connecticut.
Without going into the details of corporate
transactions, which are not relevant to the
matter now under consideration, there was an
amalgamation and the assets of the company
that we are concerned with were transferred
and sold to a company called Dunham-Bush
of Canada Limited, which is an Ontario company. That company, of course, was again a
subsidiary manifestation of its U.S. parent.
Dunham-Bush, which acquired the assets of
the company named in the bill, carries on
business now in Weston, Ontario, a suburb of
Toronto and it employs approximately 300
people. In addition to that, it has a very substantial sales force throughout Canada.
When the assets of the company referred to
in the bill were sold to the company which
now holds those assets, the consideration was
by way of a promissory note. These were not
arm's length transactions, but transactions of
a legal nature. The transaction involved payment by way of a promissory note bearing
interest at 5 per cent in the amount of

February 5,1970

SENATE DEBATES

approximately $500,000. What we have seen
so far are merely legal arrangements to
accomplish the best context in which business
can be carried on. This company, Brunner,
which is the subject matter of this bill then
became merely a corporate shell having one
asset, being this promissory note of $500,000,
and it became inactive.
Dunham-Bush subsequently incurred substantial operating losses here in Canada, and
probably there was within it a management
problem because during this period the comptroller, a man who, like myself and like many
of us, resented the multitudinous government
forms that are put on one's desk for the purpose of filling out. I know many of my legal
colleagues here have annual returns forms for
clients piling up on their desks and the dull
duty of completing them for the clients is
very often set aside. Needless to say, many
companies and their management have the
same problem that this creeping bureaucracy
bas thrust upon us. As a result, in this case
returns were not filed for two years.
I remember in my practice filing annual
returns for two years or three years in
arrears. That was normal because of the
unimportance of the substance and the
accepted practice. Unfortunately, the provisions of the federal act were amended,
removing the discretionary aspect as to the
consequence of failing to file within the stipulated time.
Now we have a very lucid example of zeal.
The company's charter was cancelled. Flowing from this-and this my legal colleagues
know could happen to any one of their clients-was a tax consequence. Now we go into
the "Alice in Wonderland" of the Income Tax
Act, that act which we have under consideration now in the Standing Senate Committee
on Banking, Trade and Commerce in connection with the White Paper.
As I mentioned, the consideration for the
transfer of assets was a promissory note. At
the time of this automatic dissolution, resulting from the comptroller's neglect to file for
two years, there was an inter-company debt
of approximately $500,000. Within the Brunner Company there was a thing called "undistributed income on hand." This was not
money in the bank, but a mythical figure that
is produced and based on a formula under the
Income Tax Act.
Under the terms of the Income Tax Act, the
dissolution of a company deems the "undistributed income on hand" to have been

received by the shareholders as a "deemed
dividend". In addition, if the shareholder happens to be an American parent company,
there is another 15 per cent withholding tax.
Hon. Mr. Haig: We are in pretty bad shape
at the moment.
Hon. Mr. Lang: There is also, under section
105 of the Income Tax Act, a "designated
surplus" section which says that when a company has "undistributed income on hand" and
its shares are acquired by another company,
there is immediately imposed a tax of 15 per
cent.
The exposure under this "Alice in Wonderland" permutation and computation results
here in a possible tax of $150,000 to the companies involved. This combination of circumstances has resulted in a very serious situation for this company and its U.S. parent.
What is a serious consideration is that if
this charter is not revived-and it can only be
revived by an act of Parliament-the American parent company will probably close down
its Canadian operations, causing a loss of
employment for approximately 300 people.
I am going to ask that this bill be referred
to the Standing Senate Committee on Banking, Trade and Commerce. I hope we can
assume that the Department of National
Revenue will not be there to object, altnough
I cannot be sure of that. It will be very interesting to see whether they do attend. But

once we start to enforce our Corpora ions Act
or administer our tax laws in a way that
destroys jobs, albeit it was the result of the
zeal of a minor official in the Department of
the Secretary of State, we are starting to
damage our economy in a way completely
disproportionate to the issues involved.
Honourable senators, as a result of this
same problem, there has been one other bill
passed in the last session of Parliament.
I anticipate, if the present attitude of
certain officials is maintained, that we will
see more of these bills.
Recently we felt we had got away from
having to deal with bills that provide for such
routine things as alternate French names for
companies, but now we are experiencing
another problem of the same nature which
Parliament will have to deal with because of
the attitudes of officials and their administration of legislative provisions we ourselves
have passed.
Honourable senators, as I indicated, if this
bill receives second reading, I will ask that it

learns about these acts or behaviour. This
might not happen until some considerable
time later, which would mean that he could
be free for several months before it was
discovered that he had done something much
earlier which had caused him to forfeit his
parole. Then his parole can be suspended and
he can be brought back into custody, and
there can be a hearing as to whether that
suspension should become a complete revocation of his parole because of his improper
activities, or be can be let out.
Now, if he is let out, away he goes and
nothing further is said about it; but if his
parole is revoked or forfeited, the question
arises whether this revocation dates from the
date of conviction of an offence or from the
time he first went to jail. When you realize

the different sentences are imposed, and not
from the date on which the first sentence is

which times are to be taken into consideration when calculating the length of time a
prisoner who has forfeited his parole must

the amount of any remissions be may have.
Honourable senators, if I were to go into
the technical details, I might get mixed up in
trying to understand them and in turn you
might be confused in trying to understand
me. So I shall ask you to take my word for it
that this is what is intended, namely, to sim-

plify matters and to ensure that a man is not
deemed to have been serving time in prison
when he was in fact at large, and to ensure
that he does get credit for any time he was
in jail during the period when efforts were
being made to catch him.

TEXTILE LABELLING BILL
SECOND READING-DEBATE ADJOURNED

Hon. Lazarus Phillips moved the second
reading of Bill S-20, respecting the labelling,
sale, importation and advertising of consumer
textile articles.
He said: Honourable senators, before proceeding with the examination of this billwhich I propose doing in two stages; firstly,
by a general introduction and, secondly, by
what I hope will be a succinct and clear
summary of the bill itself, together with references to certain statutes in relationship to
the bill-I will ask honourable senators to be
good enough to keep in mind the following
statutes to which I will be referring. The first
is The National Trade Mark and True Labelling Act passed in 1949, chapter 31 of the
statutes for that year. The second is the
Hazardous Products Act passed on June 27,
1969, chapter 42 of the statutes of that year.
The third is the old Food and Drugs Act
which bas been consolidated with a host of
amendments and which is available in respect
of these amendments up to August 13, 1969,
the original act being chapter 38 of the Statutes of Canada, 1953. The fourth is the Precious Metals Marking Act, chapter 17 of the
statutes of 1969. And the last is the Fisheries
Act, Revised Statutes of Canada, 1952, chapter 119, as amended.
Honourable senators, it is my privilege
today to introduce Bill S-20 entitled an Act
respecting the labelling, sale, importation and
advertising of consumer textile articles.
Honourable senators will appreciate as I proceed that this bill is extremely interesting,
that it covers new ground, and that it should
be welcomed by all consumers, particularly
by the women of this country who largely
bear the responsibility for purchasing the
family requirements in clothing and other
household textile articles.
Not too many years ago, before the advent
of synthetie fibres, the average housewife
could make an intelligent selection from
among the rather limited range of fibres on

SENATE DEBATES
the market, such as wool, cotton, silk, linen
and rayon. She could assess the quality and
suitability of the fabric for the purpose for
which it was to be used. However, in recent
years the industrial progress and technological advancements achieved in the chemical
and textile fields have brought immeasurable
benefits to the consumer in providing a much
broader range of man-made and synthetic
fibres. These advancements have improved
our way of life through the introduction of
many modern innovations, from wash-andwear clothing to indoor-outdoor carpeting.
However, they have been accompanied by a
great proliferation in textile terms and fibre
trade names which have vastly complicated
the task of the consumer in making an intelligent selection of fibres and the proper assessment of the fibre products on today's market.
This bill is a response by the administration to the requests and needs of the consumers, manufac urers and retailers of such textile articles. By providing this legislation, the
Government is assuming a leading role in
ensuring the right of the consumer to be
informed of the material composition of textile products which they purchase.
The old principle, as we who are lawyers
used to say, caveat emptor-let the buyer

beware-will no longer apply in respect to
textiles offered for sale at the retail level,
since this act will protect the consumer
against unfair and deceptive trade practices
in the labelling and advertising of textile
fibre content. The seller will be required to
provide the information which will help the
buyer to make a knowledgeable purchasing
decision.
It is the intention that retailers will also
derive protection comparable to that afforded
the consumer, by the requirement that the
label be affixed by the supplier of the completed article. This will therefore considerably
narrow the communications gap now existing
between the consumer and the manufacturer
of textile products.
We are all consumers of textiles. It is
estimated that each honourable senator in
this chamber is at the moment wearing
approximately four to five pounds of the
kinds of consumer textile products which will
be subject to the proposed legislation.
If honourable senators give this bill second
reading, it is my intention to move that it be
referred to the Standing Senate Committee on
Banking, Trade and Commerce for more
detailed study, before which committee the
[Hon. Mr. Phillips (Rigaud).]

February 5, 1970

departmental officials will be available. In
1969 Canadians used in excess of 700 million
pounds of textile products, or approximately
33½ pounds per capita, and it is estimated that
the total value of products subject to the
provisions of this proposed legislation is
approximately $1.4 billion annually.
The consumer has always been familiar
with the general names of the natural fibre
products-for example, wool, cotton, linenand has not had much difficulty in recognizing the inherent properties of these fibres
which determine the performance and care
characteristics. However, as I have mentioned,
there have been remarkable technological
developments in this field which-and I am
sure this will be of interest to honourable
senators. They have resulted in the share of
natural fibres entering the consumer market
dropping from 82 per cent in 1950 to 64 per
cent in 1968. The consumer is therefore confronted with and is often confused by the
quagmire of man-made fibres offered for sale
under a multitude of trade names-to quote
but a few: Arnel, Antron, Avisco, Avril,
Nylex, Nypel, Nytelle, Fortrel, Verel. This list
can be expanded since there are over 2,000
trade names for man-made fibres used in the
textile trade. The use of trade names may
often be helpful since some are household
words, but many more are not. Consumers
want to know how the incorporation of various fibres in the product will influence its
suitability, durability, comfort, ease of care
and aesthetic properties. It is a basic goal of
this bill to provide consumers with as much
information as they reasonably require to
make informed choices and to prevent fraud
and deception.
The present regulations in this field prohibit mislabelling and protect the consumer fron
fraud to this extent, but there remains a
major gap where no information is offered.
The only legislation with respect to the labelling of fibres are the regulations respecting the
labelling of textile materials, P.C. 1955-1515,
and regulations respecting the labelling of
hosiery, P.C. 1962-1239 as amended by P.C.
1964-517, both passed pursuant to section 5 of
The National Trade Mark and True Labelling
Act whch honourable senators will recollect I
referred to earlier in my remarks.
The provisions of the existing legislation
are based on the approach that a dealer presently does not have to label his product at
all. In other words, presently there is no hing
mandatory. But, if be does so label, then the
labelling must be accurate. That is to say, ail

February 5, 1970

SENATE DEBATES

such labelling must be in accordance with the
regulations to which I have referred.
Another inadequacy is that the use of the
natural, chemical, technical, or trade name is
permitted, whether or not such name is a
registered trade name. While there are manufacturers who do label informatively, generally this is not the case unless there is a competitive advantage in doing so.
In most cases, those articles which are
labelled usually do not show the fibre content
by percentage, and designations of synthetie
fibres are often by trade names. The consumer textile market and the textile technology
in Canada are very similar to those of the
United States, and because of the large
volume of trade occurring between the two
countries it is desirable that the regulations
adopted in Canada be consistent with those of
the United States. This will be largely
achieved by the provisions of the proposed
legislation.
The provisions of the bill before us, honourable senators, will therefore require mandatory labelling of prescibed consumer textile
articles to disclose by generic narnes all fibres
constituting five per cent or more of the total
fibre content. In addition, the disclosure will
be expressed in terrns of percentage for each
constituent fibre. Further provisions prohibit
any false, misleading, or deceptive representations being used in association with any
textile fibre product by means of a label or
advertisement.
Other basic provisions embodied in the bill
relate to offences, penalties, and disposition of
articles upon conviction, powers for enforcement by inspection, seizure and analytical
evidence, and the authority for the Governor
in Council to make regulations relating
mainly to the technical and operative areas.
This structure will provide the flexibility
required to keep operative provisions up to
date with technological advancements in
industry, and provide the consumer with
meaningful information and protection.
With this background, honourable senators-which I hope will be of help in explaining the details of the bill-I come now to the
bill proper.
The bill contains 18 sections. I need not
detain you with respect to section 1 which
merely gives the name of the bill as the Textile Labelling Act. The interpretation section
at this stage also does not need to be

explained. The hard core of the bill will be
found in sections 3, 4 and 5.
Section 3 deals with the labelling of textile
products. The labelling comes under two
headings-that is, labelling that will be mandatory, and labelling that is to be established
by regulation. This is a new feature. We will
now have a situation wherein certain generic
types of textile products will be determined
as those that require mandatory labelling. In
respect of those that do not require mandatory labelling, then once it is wished so to label
the product, the merchant or supplier or
importer, as the case may be, will have t
comply with the regulations as provided for
in this bill. Section 3 is the real heart of the
act.
Section 4 is also an important part of the
bill, and deals with the subject matter of
advertising of such textile products. The
advertising of such products must be related
to the provisions of section 3, mandatory or
otherwise, as the case may be.
Section 5 of the bill covers the subject
matter of false or misleading representation.
In other words, under either section 3 or section 4 technically you could have a formal
compliance with the bill from the point of
view of the determination of the ingredients
in the textile product, but by skillful manipulation of wording, or emphasis, or large print
as against small print, or by symbols-for
instance, there could be a small symbol of
a sheep in the corner which would imply that
there is a wool content even though it is not
declared in the label that there is wool. You
could have formal compliance with the
statute, but you could nevertheless have a
false or misleading representation.
Sections 3, 4, and 5 therefore compose the
hard core, as I call it, the vital part of the
bill.
Section 6 deals with the labelling of each
product, and provides that the generic name
of each textile fibre comprising 5 per cent or
more by weight of the total fibre weight of
the article shall be shown, and, subject to the
regulations, the percentage by weight of the
total fibre weight of the article of each textile
fibre named, and also the identity of the
person for whom the textile product is manufactured may also be so indicated.
It is of interest to note, honourable senators-and this is based upon the American
experience-that in addition t the natural

Section 18, provides that the act shall come

Honourable senators, I have through the
years been in one form or another professionally associated wiLh the problems of the textile industries with offences that have been
commit ed by dishonest people in marking
their products, and I consider it an honour
and a privilege that my leader in this house
has given me the opportunity to present this
bill, which I strongly commend for your
approval. If I succeed in obtaining second
reading, I have indicated my intention to ask
that the bill be referred to the Standing
Senate Committee on Banking, Trade and
Commerce for detailed consideration.
Hon. John J. Connolly: Could I ask the
honourable senator a question before there is
further debate. I must say that the question is
not prompted by my own acuity in the discussion that took place. I should perhaps preface my question by saying that the explanation given by Senator Phillips (Rigaud) has
been extremely able and clear.
My question bas to do with the problem of
onus and where that onus falls. The honourable senator was heard to say that it could fall
upon the retailer as well as upon the wholesaler and the manufacturer. As I read sections
3, 4 and 5, the reference is to the dealer.
"Dealer" is defined in section 2(e) as:
-a
person who is a manufacturer,
processor or finisher of a textile fibre
product or a person who is engaged in
the business of importing or selling any
textile fibre product.
I know there are probably opportunities for
retailers to infringe certain provisions of this
legislation, but as I read sections 3, 4 and 5
the onus is upon the manufacturer, processor
or finisher, not the retailer.

February 5, 1970

did not mean that. The normal procedure,
once the charge is laid, would be that followed by the Criminal Code, because incidentally the power is given under this act
because criminal offences are being created.
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): I
appreciate the point the honourable senator is
making, but my question is this. Is it not a
fact that in the legislation the prohibitions
apply primarily to the manufacturer, the
processor or the finisher, and not to the
retailer?
Hon. Mr. Phillips (Rigaud): I believe that
the word "dealer" referred to in sections 3, 4
and 5 would, as I see it, having regard to the
definition in section 2(e), apply specifically
not only to the manufacturer, processor or
finisher, but also includes a person who is
engaged in the business of selling any textile
product. Thus a retailer is included. The
honourable senator will see that sections 4

Hon. Mr. Isnor: Where do you find the
word "retailer" in the bill?
Hon. Mr. Phillips (Rigaud): I believe the
question put to me is whether the term
"retailer" is defined in the regulations. As far
as I can see the answer is no.
The Hon. the Speaker: May I ask honourable senators to please be kind enough to rise
when asking questions.

SENATE DEBATES

already spoken and who have said that this
proposed committee can perform a very
useful and important work. Over the past
number of years we have been trying to
arrive at a consensus as to what amendments
are necessary, or at least desirable to our
Constitution. While progress has not been too
manifest, I think all discussions at the various
conferences have been helpful and perhaps a
pre-condition, as it were, to arriving at a
satisfactory conclusion. Of course, we do not
know just how successful this new study will
be, but in any event it should be a further
step toward finding a satisfactory solution to
our constitutional difficulties. It may indeed,
and I hope it will, have a lasting and beneficial effect on the future relationship of
Canadians with one another through a new or
amended definition of the powers of various
levels of government.
Honourable senators, while all of those who
are interested in constitutional matters will
understand and appreciate the importance of
this proposed study, I would not expect the
public at large to regard it in the same light. I
do hope the committee will not be disappointed or become discouraged if they find their
work is not regarded by all as of vital importance or of overwhelming urgency. I hope the
work of this committee may generate valid
and vigorous controversy, but I would not be
surprised if it did not. We must always
remember that many Canadians are preoccupied and worried with economic matters.
They will probably be mainly concerned with
those constitutional proposals which they feel
will be of economic benefit, and there will be
some.
In his speech on this subject, the Leader of
the Government (Hon. Mr. Martin), mentioned that the study will deal with the official languages, fundamental rights, the distribution of powers between the federal and
provincial governments, the reform of institutions linked with federalism, with regional
disparities and with amending procedures. I
am sure these do not exhaust the number of
subjects
that will be
discussed
and
considered.
Honourable senators, I do not propose to
speak on all these matters, but two of them
are of particular concern to me. These are
regional disparities and amending procedures.
When we speak of regional disparity in relation to the Constitution I think it emphasizes
once more the great weight economic considerations have in our concept of a strong
united Canada. Perhaps I do not express it

too well, but it is my firm conviction that
most, if not all, of our problems have an
underlying economic cause or reason, and if
the economic problem can be solved then the
solution can be found for the remainder of
the difficulty. What I am trying to say is that
if the problem of regional disparity in Canada
could be solved, then we would soon arrive at
a solution of our constitutional problems. I
think there is no doubt but that a person's
attitude towards constitutional matters, even
his thinking about them, is greatly influenced
-perhaps even more than he himself realizes
-by the economic environment in which he
lives and works.
Honourable senators, we al want Canada
to be strong and prosperous. We want it to be
a country where all the people can live and
work together in peace, harmony and unity,
respecting each other's rights and privileges
and accepting their duties and responsibilities
to the end that we are worthy of this wonderful land, a land blessed by the Creator perhaps above all others. We will never be
worthy of it until we give to al Canadians,
no matter where they live, an equal economic
opportunity.
Honourable senators, no matter what
recommendations the committee may make
and no matter how wise and beneficial they
may be, they will be of no value unless they
can be put into effect. This means that a
satisfactory formula must be found whereby
we can change and amend our own Constitution. To me it is utterly ridiculous and fantastic that in this day and age we must go to the
Parliament of Great Britain to seek amendments to parts of our Constitution, which is
the British North America Act. It must be
most embarrassing to that body to have to
deal with this matter, and it is humiliating
for us to have to request them to do so. It is
our own fault and not theirs that this situation exists. We have been unable to agree on
a formula to change our Constitution in
Canada.
Attempts to find such a formula have been
made, and some which have been formulated
and advanced by very able men have nearly
had acceptance. So I believe, that this
proposed committee should address itself at
once to the great problem of finding a formula whereby we can amend our Constitution
in Canada. The present way of appealing to
the Parliament of Great Britain is not only
humiliating, but it is also cumbersome. The
Constitution lacks flexibility. It is too rigid. I
know that a good many amendments have
been made over the years, but remember

SENATE DEBATES
that these amendments have been made only
with the consent of all the provincial governments and the federal Government. What
would happen if the federal Government
asked for an amendment to the B.N.A. Act
and one or more of the provinces registered
objection in London? What would happen if
one chamber of the legislature of a province
or of the Parliament of Canada requested an
amendment without the concurrence of the
other? It would place the Parliament of Great
Britain in an impossible position.
So, honourable senators, the amendments
which have been made to the B.N.A. Act can
only serve as illustrating the rigidity of our
present Constitution.
There may be some who will say we do not
need such a study as is now proposed. They
may say there is nothing basically wrong
with our Constitution, that it has served us
well. Of course it bas served us well; it bas
been a good Constitution, and it is no criticism of it to say that it may now need to be
overhauled and changed.
Might I interject at this point that other
venerable constitutions than the Constitution
of Canada find the need to change. We need
only look to the Church to which I belong to
see that change is absolutely necessary for all
constitutions.
Since our Constitution was formulated, new
situations have arisen which could not have
been foreseen by those wise men who drafted
it. Yes, conditions are different. We have the
great movement of population to the cities
with all the problems that this has created.
These are the new and heavy responsibilities
of the provinces and municipalities. We have
the tremendous cost of education and of the
shared welfare programs. In many cases we
have the crushing burden of municipal taxation. These are hard problems which must be
solved, and which I for one do not believe can
be solved without some far-reaching amendments to our Constitution.
Honourable Senators, there is no need to
examine the motion in detail. I think it is
wide enough to give all the powers that are
necessary to make an extensive and detailed
examination of all the proposals which may
be put forward to change our Constitution.
I note in passing that there has been
omitted from this motion a paragraph which
we usually put in similar Senate motions.
There is nothing here which would give the
committee the power to engage the services
[Hon. Mr. Macdonald (Cape Breton).]

February 5, 1970

of such counsel, staff and personal advisers as
the committee might deem necessary for the
purposes of its inquiry.
With these few remarks, honourable senators, I wish this committee every success.
Even if it is not wholly successful, the committee's recommendations will be of great
value.
Hon. Mr. Choquette: I wonder if the Leader
of the Government can explain why the usual
provision for counsel, staff, and so on has
been omitted from the motion?
Hon. Mr. Martin: I believe that when the
members on this committee from both bouses
meet, this and other matters will be discussed.
Hon. Orville H. Phillips: Honourable senators, I shall not delay you long. Like Senator
Fergusson, it was not my intention to speak
on this motion but I have been inspired by
ber remarks. I cannot be as emphatic as she
was. I would like to express my surprise and
shock that, when looking around the Senate
as the honourable Senator Fergusson spoke,
many senators seemed to be unaware that the
Senate was constituted on a regional basis. I
think the most surprised face was that of the
Leader of the Government in the Senate-I
am sorry be bas had to leave for a momentand I could detect surprise on the part of
other honourable senators. This rather irked
me and encouraged me to make a few brief
remarks.
If you have any doubt as to the wisdom of
regional representation, go back and read the
discussion at the time of Confederation. There
you will find the basis for the Senate. I do not
think that today anyone could find anything
in that to complain about or to disturb him. If
I may be rather facetious and not detract
from the excellent remarks of Senator Fergusson, I would point out that the Senate
membership on the proposed joint committee
comprises seven members from what we call
in the Maritimes, Upper Canada, and three
from the rest of Canada. It is shocking when
you see it on paper, but I say to my friend
that we have had 100 years of this 7 to 3
basis, so it really does not disturb me.
On the point she brought out, and which I
would like to emphasize, we note there is no
woman on the Constitution Committee. This
is very disturbing when you study it, but it
may be some consolation prize to hold out to
honourable Senator Fergusson that there is a
Royal Commission on the Status of Women at
present in existence and perhaps it will
recommend allowing ladies to become part of

February 5, 1970

SENATE DEBATES

the Constitutional Committee. I say "ladies"
rather than "honourable lady senators," and I
make that distinction because perhaps some
day a lady member of the other place may
serve as a member of the committee.
Hon. Mr. Fournier (Madawaska-Restigouche): And put men on the Royal Commission?
Hon. Mr. Phillips (Prince): No, Senator
Fournier, there are enough men on royal
commissions. But it may be that we will get a
royal commission on the status of men, so be
optimistic.
Senator Grosart, in a well-thought-out
speech emphasized that we tend to forget that
certain parts of the Constitution have worked
extremely well, that we have done well in 100
years, that we have become the third nation
in the world, at least as far as the standard of
living is concerned. Then he went on. He
opened the door and asked for suggestions to
be directed to members of the Senate who
will serve on the joint committee. Here is
where I would like to make my suggestions.
I believe it is honourable Senator O'Leary
who is always pointing out to this chamber
that 90 per cent of the effective legislation is
comprised of regulations that are passed by
orders in council. In other words, 90 per cent
of the work of our Government is done by
order in council; and it is a fact that these
orders in council are never checked either in
the House of Commons or in the Senate. I
realize that this is rather shocking, and it
would be interesting to know what the reaction of the average Canadian would be if he
knew that. But of course the average Canadian reading the newspapers or watching
television thinks of Parliament as being in
session. He does not realize that 90 per cent
of Government-to use the word "Government" for want of a better expression-is
being done by order in council. Not only is it
being done by order in council, but those
orders in council are often carried out with as
few as three members of the cabinet present
to pass them.
I am now going to propose a complete
change in our electoral system. I am going to
propose that each party nominate 25 members
to form the cabinet. I put in the number 25
on purpose, because, if I did not put in 25, the
Liberals would nominate 265 for the House of
Commons and make them all cabinet ministers. They are having difficulty keeping backbenchers now. But let us limit it to 25 honourable members and let them pass their orders

in council. There is a certain basis for doing
it that way. The Government complains about
the difficulty of getting legislation through the
House of Commons. Think how much easier it
would be to bring it out in the form of an
order in council. Moreover, consider the cost
of maintaining the other place. When an
honourable member speaks in the other place
it costs around $1,000 a minute. If you were
to take that figure, or even half of it, and
then consider the speeches of Stanley
Knowles, for instance, you would find that
the cost of his speeches would be equivalent
to the cost of a second Trans-Canada Highway. Which would the average Canadian
prefer-a copy of the speeches of Stanley
Knowles or a second Trans-Canada Highway?
Hon. Mr. Martin: Who is Stanley Knowles?
Is he a member of the House of Commons?
Hon. Mr. Phillips (Prince): I believe he is
vaguely connected with Winnipeg, or possibly
it is with Windsor. I am not sure of that, but
it is either one of those centres.
Then consider the riding of Essex and the
former member there. I think since 1930 he
has taken up with his speeches a cost equivalent to the cost of the proposed Prince
Edward Island causeway.
There are indeed many reasons for agreeing with me that we should abolish the House
of Commons.
One really appealing reason for doing so is
that the chamber itself could be used as a
sort of centre for a continuous federal-provincial conference. And as honourable senators know, that is the sort of thing that could
be considered "in" today. Today you have to
be "with it," to be doing the "in-thing", and
since the Government of today seems to be
very interested in being "in" and "with it",
we could have a continuous dominion-provincial conference going on in the other place.
Now, I do not want to gloss over or ignore
the fact that there have been certain suggestions concerning change or reform, if I may
use that word, of the Senate. I have made
certain suggestions in that regard myself. I
should like to suggest that this chamber could
then be constituted of so many members, still
on a regional basis, with one-half appointed
by the federal Government and one-half
appointed by the provincial governments, and
it could then sit in judgment on the orders in
council passed by the federal cabinet. Perhaps, if we carried my suggestion to its logical and orderly conclusion, the Senate could

SENATE DEBATES

also sit in judgment on the orders in council
passed by the provincial governments. Then
we could also abolish our provincial legislatures. Doing that would meet the requirenents of all the people who want to tear
down our Constitution and give us a new one.
We would then be able to start from nothing
and be in the same position as Chairman
Mao: we would have torn down but would
not have been able to build up.
I hope honourable senators who have been
appointed to this committee will bear my
lighthearted remarks in mind when performing their duties on the committee.
On motion of Hon. Mr. McDonald, for Hon.
Mr. Croll, debate adjourned.
SMALL BUSINESSES

LOANS ACT

BILL TO AMEND-SECOND

READING

Hon. W. M. Benidickson moved the second
reading of Bill C-9, to amend the Small Businesses Loans Act.
He said: Honourable senators, you will
share my sorrow that the honourable gentleman who it was intended should sponsor this
bill and address to you the preliminary and
explanatory remarks concerning it, our distinguished friend and revered colleague, honourable Senator Roebuck, is not able to be here
today owing to his recent ill health. I have
inherited the notes of this hard-working
senator, notes which he prepared in anticipation of speaking on this occasion. I know that
we all wish him a speedy recovery.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Benidickson: It is typical of Senator Roebuck that in his notes are to be found
some rather cogent remarks, one of which I
should like to quote now. These are the words
of Senator Roebuck:
I have been declaring for years that the
way to meet the problem of poverty is
through the creation of jobs by the promotion of business enterprise-jobs and
still more jobs. Were the unemployed
taken care of in this way, competition for
workers would solve the problem of the
working poor.
Well, here we are doing something in
that d:rection; we are making loans to
small businesses to assist them in their
efforts to compete with big business and
to expand.
Also in Senator Roebuck's notes I found a
typical suggestion that under this act loans
[Hon. Mr. Phillios (Prince).]

February 5, 1970

should be restricted to businesses with a turnover, or a volume of sales, under half a
million dollars. He pointed out also, and here
I use his own words, "that the big fellows do
not benefit by this legislation". He also went
on to say that the professions do not benefit,
and that as a lawyer he could introduce the
bill without any self-interest.
Now, honourable senators, fromn that point
on, and having paid tribute to Arthur
Roebuck, I want to spell out some of
what is included in this amending act. The
Small Businesses Loans Act was introduced
in 1960 and became effective on January 1,
1961. Under the legislation to date I can now
say that in round figures almost $200 million
has been loaned solely by the chartered banks.
I would further estimate that to date the
number of loans totals perhaps 21,000. The
Government, of course, under this legislation
has made guarantees to the only lenders up to
now, which were the chartered banks. The
Government guaranteed to them 10 per cent
of their losses. The business enterprises which
were eligible for financial assistance fall
within a wide range of business classes
including manufacturing, wholesale trade,
retail trade, service business, construction,
transportation and communication.
The Small Businesses Loans Act is only one
of three similar measures by which Parliament seeks to assist in expansion and
improvement projects. The other two acts
that are similar are the Farmn Improvement
Loans Act and the Fisheries Improvement
Loans Act. All these acts are limited in their
period of operation, and one purpose of the
amending bill before us is to extend the effective period of this Small Businesses Loans
Act until June 30, 1971. It is intended as a
result of this amendment and this extension
that the activities of all three acts shall terminate simultaneously and that further extensions and changes may be considered in a
group.
Under the Small Businesses Loans Act, as it
now stands, loans are made by chartered
banks up to a maximum of $25,000 to any one
borrower basically for two purposes: (a) the
purchase of fixed or movable assets or equipment; (b) the purchase, construction or
improvement of business premises. These
loans are secured generally by a first charge
on the machinery or equipment, or by a mortgage on the business premises, together with
a promissory note, and a bank may at any
time require further security. These loans

February 5, 1970

SENATE DEBATES

may be paid over a period of up to ten years.
This is different from an ordinary application
to a bank for a loan because of the guarantee.
Bank managers are required to exercise such
care in the making of loans for which they
obtain a government guarantee as they use in
the conduct of their general banking business.
The rate of interest which the bank could
charge on loans under the act when the program was initiated was 54 per cent. This
rate continued until 1968 when it was enacted
by order in council that the rate should be
determined on the basis of the average of
Canada Bond yields over the preceding six
months, plus a marginal one per cent. At the
present time the rate is 84 per cent. Unlike
the companion acts, there was permission in
the original legislation to set the rate of interest by order in council.
The amendments to the Small Businesses
Loans Act which are before us parallel
amendments already made in the Farm
Improvement Loans Act and the Fisheries
Improvement Loans Act, so that all three acts
may operate on a consistent and comparable
basis.
As honourable senators will observe in the
bill before them, clause 1 is a very important
amendment to the original act. It repeals section 2(a) of the existing act so that now, in
addition to the chartered banks which for ten
years have been the sole lenders, there will
be a guarantee extended to other eligible
lenders which include credit unions, caisses
populaires, co-operative credit societies, trust
companies, loan companies and insurance
companies as designated by the minister.
Clause 2 makes it clear that the minister's
liability in his guarantee does not extend to
loans made after June 30, 1971, thus extending the time to that date.
Under clause 3 of the bill, honourable senators will notice that by section 5 of the act
certain periods of time were constituted as
lending periods, and the minister's liability
for losses sustained by any one bank on any
loan made by that lender bank during any
lending period was linited to 10 per cent of
the aggregate of the loans made by that lending bank during that lending period.
This was satisfactory when chartered banks
were the only lenders under the act and 10
per cent of the aggregate of loans by any
lender was sufficient to cover, as a rule, loans
made by that lender. But this may not be the
case with some small volume lenders which it

is proposed to add to those now entitled to
make loans under the act. Therefore, in
clause 3 there are changes in the amount of
the Government guarantee and they vary
according to the total amount of the lending.
The guarantee shall now be limited to 90 per
cent of that part of the loans made to any
lender, during the new lending period, which
does not exceed $125,000. That is a small
volume of lending. Then in the next category
there is a guarantee of 50 per cent of that
part of such loans that exceeds $125,000 and
is not in excess of $250,000. Then the minister's liability by virtue of his guarantee shall
be limited to 10 per cent of that part of that
lender's loan made during the new lending
period that exceeds $250,000.
Clause 3, subclause 2, makes a further
change in the original act whereby section 5,
subsection 2, of that act is amended by
adding an additional lending period to that to
which b have already referred. The new lending period has the same termination date as
the associated acts, so that the Farm Improvement Loans Act and the Fisheries Improvement Loans Act will terminate simultaneously
with the Small Businesses Loans Act.
The amendment in clause 4 limits the minister's liability for loans made during the new
lending period to an overall gross by all lenders. The overall gross is divided into two
sections: $100 million will be the maximum
liability in the case of guarantees to the
chartered banks, and $50 million is provided
and now added as an aggregate guarantee to
the new forms of lenders such as those I have
mentioned-credit unions, caisses populaires,
co-operative societies, insurance companies,
trust companies and loan companies.
In clause 5 of the bill it is proposed that we
amend section 8 of the act by adding thereto
a further subsection. This amendment is
consequential upon the amendment adding
the new forms of lenders.
These are the proposed amendments to this
statute which was introduced in 1960 and
under which, as I have stated, almost $200
million has been provided to small businesses.
It must not be assumed that because the
specified lending periods in all three of these
associated acts are being made to terminate
on a similar day in June 1971, this will terminate federal Government assistance to small
businesses, farm improvements and fisheries
as defined in these acts. I am assured that the
concurrency in termination is for the purpose
only of concurrent consideration of all three

SENATE DEBATES
acts, so that if amendments are found necessary or advisable, they may apply simultaneously to all three associated acts.
Again, I pay tribute to the industry and
homework that was done by our colleague
Senator Roebuck on this amending bill.
Hon. Mr. Grosari: Has the honourable
sponsor of the bill any information as to the
losses which have been incurred in the lending of this $200 million to date?
Hon. Mr. Benidickson: Yes. I made that
inquiry and was informed that, on a percentage basis, the losses have been perhaps .4 per
cent. In the last annual report, which covered
the period ending 1968, the losses were a little
over $709,000 on loans of $170 million, or
something of that nature.
Hon. Orville H. Phillips: ilonourable senators, I must first thank the honourable Senator Benidickson for his explanation of the
bill. I find it rather interesting that at the
time the act was introduced he was the Opposi ion financial critic. I had hoped to have an
opportunity of checking Hansard and comparing his speech on that day with today's but, I
think rather fortunately for the honourable
senator, I did not have the opportunity to do
so.
Perhaps the most neglected aspect of our
industrial atmosphere in Canada is that of the
small business, and I would like to take just a
moment to point out to the Senate just how
important small business firms are to Canada.
Firstly, we have 440,000 firms that qualify
under the designation of small business firms;
that is, 90 per cent of the companies registered in Canada. These firms account for half
our Gross National Product and for more
than 50 per cent of our employment.
While the honourable senator was introducing the bill I was thinking of a small town in
this vicinity-I believe it is Eganville, although I would not be sure-which had been
given television, radio and newspaper publicity. On one occasion the sawmill, employing
30 or 40 people, burned to the ground. Then,
within a few days, the bakery was destroyed
by fire. These were two of the few small
businesses that kept this small integral part
of a province going, and when they were
destroyed by fire everyone in the town
asked the same question, "What do we do?" I
cannot think of anything that better illustrates the importance of small industries to
Canada than these particular instances.
[Hon. Mr. Benidickson.]

February 5, 1970

Yet, honourable senators, despite the
importance and necessity of expanding small
businesses, the loans under this act have been
steadily declining. In the period from 1961 to
1965 such loans averaged $26 million per
annum. In 1966 and 1967 they declined to $20
million per annum. In 1968 they had declined
to $11 million. Then, as honourable senators
are aware, there was a change in the interest
rate, and it is expected that when the final
figures for 1969 are available they will show
an increase. It is most unfortunate that the
objective of the act has not been achieved,
and small businesses are still groping around
for financing.
As Senator Roebuck stated in the remarks
that he was preparing for this occasion, big
business was excluded from this act. Big business can usually go out and find money for
itself. It is the small-town business that needs
assistance, and yet, somehow-not intentionally, I would bo the first to admit-we do not
seem to be achieving the objective of the act.
If I may for a moment consider why we are
not accomplishing what was primarily intended as the purpose of the act, in the committee
stage before the other place the minister
introducing the legislation stated that it gave
complete authority to the local bank manager
to decide whether he would grant a loan
under this act. Perhaps this is one reason why
we have fallen down badly in regard to the
administration of this act.
If I may digress for a moment, I will tell
you a story about the manager of a smalltown bank who had an artificial eye. He was
very sensitive about it and yet was proud of
the fact that it was such a good imitation. A
certain businessman was trying to persuade
the bank manager to extend him a loan, but
he was making no progress. After he had
hammered away for some time, the bank
manager said, "I have an artificial eye. If you
can tell me which eye is artificial I will give
you the loan." The businessman looked at
him and said, "It is your right eye." The
manager was taken aback and asked him how
he knew that, to which the businessman
replied, "It has more sympathy in it than
your left eye."
Honourable senators, perhaps it is in this
respect that we have fallen down.
On reading the debate which took place on
this bill in the other place I noticed that some
participants want greater pressure placed
upon the banks to make more loans available
under this act, the Farm Improvement Loans

February 5, 1970

SENATE DEBATES

Act, and the Fisheries Improvement Loans
Act. I have to agree with those members. I
think that in the future when this act is being
reviewed we must consider that perhaps a
certain percentage of loans in the small towns
and villages should be classified under what I
call the Big Three.
Senator Benidickson, in introducing this
bill, stated that the guarantee was being
changed. I should like to draw the attention
of the Senate to the remarks of the honourable the Minister without Portfolio who introduced this bill in the other place. His remarks
are to be found at page 781 of the House of
Commons Hansard. As I interpret them he
said that presently 10 per cent of the aggregate loans in effect cover 100 per cent of the
losses suffered by the banks. Then lie went on
to point out that lie thought this was an
improvement. He said that the coverage
would be 90 per cent of the aggregate value
of the first $125,000. This, as I pointed out
earlier, is a very limited number of loans; in
fact, it could be only five maximum loans.
Then the coverage drops back to 50 per cent,
and after ten maximum loans it drops back to
10 per cent.
I am rather doubtful that this amendment
will achieve its purpose unless the Government is anticipating a great many smaller
loans. That may not be the case, but when we
get into committee we should consider this
amendment very seriously, because I do not
feel it is going to achieve the purpose for
which the Government states it is amending
the act.
A further point I should like to mention
concerns the limit of $25,000. When the act
was introduced in 1961, $25,000 was a considerable amount, but since that time things
have changed considerably. When we look at
the I.D.B. figures we see that its loans average
in the range of $40,000 to $50,000. This indicates that today the limit of $25,000 is too
small.
There are further restrictions on loans, and
I would like to mention one in particular
regarding communities which are attempting
to attract professional men. I am sure all
honourable senators have heard and read the
publicity given on radio, TV and in the newspapers respecting a small community in
Ontario which is attempting to attract a
doctor. There had been a doctor there for
some 40 years, but he retired, and for a year

and a half that village has been without a
doctor. It is building a clinic, and has raised
half the necessary funds. Such a village
should be able to apply under this act for the
$20,000 or $25,000 needed to equip that clinic.
I point out that it is the village that is equipping the clinic, and not the individual doctor.
In my view there should be a distinction
drawn between the doctor and the village.
As an additional point I should like to mention the three-year limitation. I mentioned
earlier that there were 440,000 small business
firms in Canada. It is not unreasonable to
expect that out of those 440,000 firms some
are going to want to expand and some are
going to be sold. Unless a business has been
in existence for three years it cannot qualify
under this act. In the next amendment I hope
that the Government will give consideration
to this fact.
I have no objection to a broadening of the
base of the financial institutions that can
make loans under this act. I would point out,
however, that at no time in the past were all
the funds exhausted. If the trust companies,
credit unions, and other institutions that
qualify under the amendment to the act are
going to utilize the $50 million that is set
aside for them, they are going to have to
engage in an advertising campaign. I suggest
that the Government should institute a campaign of publicity, very much like the one
carried on by the I.D.B., and make it known
that this fund is available now for trust companies and credit unions and encourage these
small firms to make applications to those
lenders as well as to chartered banks.
The provisions of the act have been extended for eighteen months, and it has been
indicated that during this time it will be
reviewed and its effectiveness compared with
that of the other two acts which provide for
the basic industries of farming and fishing.
We have now had nine years of experience
with this act, and it is my hope that the
Government will find that it has been worthwhile, and will give consideration to its shortcomings and faults. They are not extensive.
The act has worked very well, and I hope
that after eighteen months it will be continued in an even better form than its present
one.

policy of the Government of the day to
encourage small business. Senator Carter has
pointed out, I think quite correctly, that even
then there were some shortcornings in the
bill. However, these have not now been corrected as perhaps they might have been over
the years in llght of on-going experience with
the act. However, srnall business did have
reason to believe that the policy of the Government was syrnpathetic.
There are some improvements in the act
brought forward in this bill, but it seerns to
me that small business generally wrnl not;
derive very much cornfort from this in view
of other policies of this Governrnent towards
srnall business. We are faced with the anornaly that at the sarne trne as we are discussing
this bill one of our comrnittees is discussing
the White Paper on Taxation, one of the
main features of which is to suggest as Government policy perhaps the most disastrous
stroke that any governrnent has ever given to
the future of srnall business in this country. I
refer, of course, to the policy suggested that
small business is now to lose what has been Its
greatest competitive benefit from governrnent
policy, narnely, the 10w rate of corporate
income tax on a certain proportion of its
gross profit. Honourable senators wull be
aware of the protest that bas arisen across
the country with respect to this proposai. I do
not recollect in my Urne of observing the
Canadian scene a protest as universal and as
unanimous as that which we now have in this
country against the proposed policy of the
Governrnent in relation to srnall business.
Senator Phillips (Prince) bas indicated the
magnitude of the area of our econorny that is
involved. He bas said it is about 50 per cent
of our G.N.P., and provides about 50 per cent
of the jobs in this country. Yet we are
expected, I suppose, to congratulate the Goverment on making sorne minor but useful
improvements in this act at the saine Urne as
it is imposing a load on small business that, if
the Governrnent persists in its policy, will
have obviously disastrous resuits to the
economy of this country, and for the miîddle
class of our population generally.
I would suggest to the sponsor of the bil
(Hon. Mr. Benidickson) that, having accornplished as well as I arn sure he wull have, tbe
purposes of the Goverrnent in putting forward this bull, hie will then use the very considerable influence he bas to persuade the
21498-33

Government to withdraw now this rnost
obnoxious policy proposai in the White Paper.
I say now, because while there is some evidence of a f airly early repentance on the part
of the Minister of Finance, the indications are
that he wili wait out the debate and that as it
cornes dloser to election Urne perhaps there
will be a change of heart, mind and policy.
I would hope that the sponsor, and others
of my friends opposite, will be able to persuade the Governmnent that it is important to
announce a change in this policy now,
because the on-going problems, the fear of
what this announced policy may do, are
already having a deleterious effect on the
conduct of smiall business in Canada. I see
that my honourable friend the sponsor of the
bill is llstening with his usual attention, and I
arn sure hie will carry frorn this chamber this
very important message to bis colleagues i
another place.
Hon. Mr. Phillips (Rigaud): May I put a
question to the honourable senator? I amn
wondering whether in respect of benefits
given to small businesses hie rneant that it is
in respect of gross profits rather than net
profits. I think the taxation is based on net
profits, and I have a feeling that he meant to
say net profits. The benefit under the Income
Tax Act for small businesses is based on net
profits rather than gross profits.
Hon. Mr. Grosart: Technically, of course,
the honourable senator is correct, and I would
be the last to argue with himi on a matter of
interpretation of the corporate incorne tax
act. When I used the word "gross" I used it in
the concept of the small businessrnan who is
not greatly concerned whether he is thinking
in terns of gross or net profit. He bas a profit
at the end of the year. He rnay declare that
profit, as corporations very often do, in terrnis
of profit before tax. I may say that I have
always regarded that as one of the rnost
stupid statements in the whole business
econorny of our country. Obviously there is
no such thing as profit before tax. It is either
profit or it is not. To say profit before tax is
to refer only to one of rnany taxes. It is rea]ly
profit before one anticipated tax. It is not
profit before tax, which is a non-existent
thing. That is why I used the other phrase
frorn the point of view of small businesses.

MeL. PATERSON-THIRTIETH ANNIVERSARY
IN THE SENATE

Hon. Paul Marin: Honourable senators,
before we proceed with our business I should
like to offer to two honourable senators our
warmest congratulations on the thirtieth
anniversary of their appointmnent to the
Senate, yesterday being the actual anniversary. I refer to Senator Salter A. Hayden and
Senator Norman McL. Paterson.
Thirty years of public service and membership in this house represent a contribution to
Canada and the Senate. Their contributions
have been many and productive. Both senators have won for themnselves the gratitude of
Canadians generally.
I amn pleased to offer ini the narne of those
on this side-and I arn sure I speak for al
members of this honourable house, our sincere congratulations to Senator Hayden and
Senator Paterson. We wish themn contlnued
good health, and continued service in this
chamber.
Hon. Joseph A. Sullivan: Honourabie senators, I wish to join with the honourable
Leader of the Government <Hon. Mr. Martin)
in the remarks he has just made pertaining to
Senator Hayden and Senator Paterson. I wish
particularly to say a few words concerning
my friend of many years, Senator Hayden.
In man's life dreaxns always precede deeds.
Perhaps this is because, as Goethe said:
Our desires are presentiments of the
faculties latent within us, and signs of
what we may be capable of doing. We
crave for what we already secretiy possess. Passionate anticipation thus changes
that which is materiaily possible into
dreamed reality.
For centuries alchemists have sought the
secret of changing ordinary metals into gold,
but men have always lived who have performed tis miracle of bombarding the mole21498--331

cules to change the formn of events. I refer to
the gift of turning disaster into triumph by
one stroke. Ail great generals have it-this
abllity to make a retreat a mere recoil for a
new attack. Ail great financiers have it-this
gift of maldng capital from their mistakes. Ail
great lawryers have it-this art of transforming disadvantage into vlctory.
This institution, tis body, this most valuable bicameral part o! our parliamentary institution, oelebrates an epoch in the history of a
man, one of the most distinguished members
from the beginning of its time until now. It la
flot difficuit for me to comment today on what
is i rny heart pertaining to my friend. Tis
most distinguished o! senators, the Chairman
o! the Standing Senate Committee on Banking, Trade and Commerce, the honourable
Senator Salter A. Hayden, has adorned these
halls for a period of 30 years. His country, bis
party, can neyer repay the debt of gratitude
they owe this singularly brilliant and ldnd
man. He has gained his pre-eminent position
i public affairs as a resuit of is proven
ability, intregrity and intellectual expertise. I
know whereof I speak. I have been his
friend and his doctor for many, many years.
His success as a member of the legal profession has been due to two f actors. One is
thorough preparation. Any speaker may take
note. The lawryer and the orator both seek to
persuade. Preparation is by far the major
factor in attaining the objective. The second
is more subtie. It is the skiil of translating an
unfavourable situation into an asset. It has
been said that an admission is the strongest
argument. It la the best method of "1taking the
wind out o! the sals" or out o! the adversary,
provided, of course, it is combined with the
art of exploiting the concession. The aimn is
neyer to conquer an adversary or an audience
but have it agree as if it wouid have in the
ftrst place. The listener must believe, "I camne,
I saw, 1 concurred." Honourable senators,
there are very f ew people who have corne
before the Standing Senate Commlttee on
Banking, Trade and Commerce who came,
who saw and who did flot concur. The
extremists who came before him were provided with a one-way ticket to oblivion.
I would like to refer briefiy to a book published by F. A. Kunz, The Modern Senate of
Canada: A Re-appraisal. I arn sure you have
ail read it. On page 243 the author states:
The role of the Banking and Commerce

received no message. Undoubtedly it is true
and I wifl talk to you, but you cannot publish
anything." I can tell you that at ten o'clock
that night my ear was against the radio.
There were 12 senators appointed that night. I

complicated.
I examined the original section 11A and
found it was one sentence, but that one sentence consisted of 150 words of two or more
letters. The proposed section 11A has two
subsections, but subsection 1 consists of one
sentence of 122 words. The original subsection
1 of section 17 is also one sentence in length,
although it is divided into three paragraphs,
and consists of 100 words. The amendment to
make it clear is five paragraphs long and
consists of one sentence of 166 words.
Honourable senators, I do believe legislation
can be constructed better than this. Indeed, I
think legislation should be so worded and so
constructed that its meaning is clear to all
who read it. I do not think any changes can
now be made in this bill, because if this
were attempted the whole act might have
to be gone over and reworded. Indeed, I do
not believe any useful purpose would be
served by referring this bill to a committee.
While the wording is open to criticism, the
intent will be understood by those administering the act and, indeed, I suppose it will be
understood by others who may be affected by
it even if they do not read it.
While examining this bill I did notice one
thing which struck me as being unusual and,
indeed, unfair and inequitable. Paragraph (a)
of the new section 17(1) provides that when a
parole is forfeited the paroled inmate shall
serve the portion of the term to which he was
sentenced and which remained at the time
of the parole, including earned remission
standing to his credit.
I understand that this "earned time remission," which is calculated at the rate of three
days a month, is earned by the inmate by good
behaviour. If this is so, and if he has earned
it, then he owns it, and by taking it away
from him if he breaks his parole there is then
an additional built-in penalty and punishment
[Hon. Mr. Macdonald.]

The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, when shal this bill be read the third
time?
Hon. Mr. Martin: Honourable senators, I
have noted what Senator Macdonald had to
say about the language of this bill. There is
certainly no objection to referring this bill to
a committee, if there is any doubt about the
language. There is no doubt in my mind
about what the bill provides, but we in this
place should not hesitate to revise bills if we
think there is occasion.
I wonder if Senator Macdonald wishes,
after the consideration he has given this
matter, to urge that the bill be sent to a
committee. If not, we can pass it. If there is
any doubt at all about it then I will be
happy to propose that the bil be referred to
the Standing Senate Committee on Legal and
Constitutional Affairs.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Honourable senators,
I do not feel that at the present time there
would be any real advantage in referring this
bill to a committee.
Hon. Mr. Martin: Is the honourable senator
saying that because of the provisions of the
main act?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Yes, because of the
provisions of the main act. I think that the
Senate should be not a body that reviews
only legislation that comes before it, but it
should also be a body that reviews legislation
that is already on the statute books.

February 10, 1970

TEXTILE LABELLING BILL
SECOND

READING

The Senate resumed from Thursday, February 5, the adjourned debate on the motion of
Hon. Mr. Phillips (Rigaud) for the second
reading of Bill S-20, respecting the labelling,
sale, importation and advertising of consumer
textile articles.
Hon. Fred M. Blois: Honourable senators, I
wish to make a few remarks concerning Bill
S-20 because I believe it affects more people
than any other bill that has come before us.
This bill will actually affect over 20 million
persons and, therefore, I think it should be
given very careful consideration.
I apologize to Senator Phillips (Rigaud) for
having to be absent from the chamber when
he explained the bill. However, I have read
his comments a couple of times. I do not find
any fault with them, but I feel he did not
cover a number of subjects that I would like
to bring to the attention of this house this
evening.
The object of this bill is to protect the
consumer, but in my opinion it is not going to
protect the consumer to any extent. In fact, I
am afraid that it is going to confuse the consumer much more than he is confused at the
present time.
The main item covered by the provisions of
this bill are textile fibres, and what they contain. I have some doubt in my mind as to just
what is meant when the bill talks about a
percentage by weight. A tailor called me
today asking about this very point.
Let me take as an example this suit that I
am wearing. What is the total fibre weight of
the article? Does this refer to all the cloth
that is in this suit, or does it refer to just the
lining which may be made of cotton, rayon,
nylon, or a mixture of al these yarns? The
pockets of many suits are made of either
cotton, linen, or nylon. If the percentage is of
the total weight of the suit, then does the
total weight include the buttons? I know that
there is a small pin stripe in the suit I am
wearing, and I know that it is not made of
wool. I am not sure, without having the suit
torn apart and analyzed, just what its various
components are, and I cannot see how it is
important to the ultimate consumer to know
exactly the percentage content of the various
fibres.
While I am on the subject of suits, I will
mention the manufacturer of the cloth. As we
all know, cloth is sold in various sizes of bolts
21498-34

or rolls. A bolt may contain anywhere from
50 to 100 yards of cloth, and there may be a
mark or a ticket or something on that bolt of
cloth to identify it. When I order a suit, a
length of cloth is cut off the bolt. Does this
bill require that there be a mark on every
suit length? It is going to be difficult to mark
every suit length, because more cloth is
required to make a suit for a large man than
a small man, and many people like to have
two pairs of trousers with a suit. I am not
sure how it will be possible to mark the suit
lengths, and again I am not sure how important it is. But, as I read the act, this must be
shown in some way.
There are other items such as footwear.
There are many lines of footwear, the tops or
some part of which are made of textile fibre,
and not necessarily on a percentage basis.
Again, does the bill refer to a percentage of
the textile fibre, or of the total weight? This
is worrying a great many people. During the
last few days I have had three manufacturing
firms telephone me, and one called today
saying that they have read the act but they
do not understand what it means.
Furthermore, many people are worried as
to the fines that may be assessed, and against
whom they will be assessed. Who will pay the
fine? Will it be the tailor who actually seils
the garment, or will it be the manufacturer
who makes the fibre? In the case of an
imported product, will it be the importer who
brings the fabric into the country? Just how
this legislation is going to work is not clear to
me, and I am sure it is not clear to many
manufacturers.
Let us consider for a moment a low grade
material that may be imported into the country from a manufacturer in some other part
of the world. I doubt if there is any law or
any possibility of the Canadian Government
or anyone else forcing them to pay the fine.
That might mean that the importer would
have to do it, or that he would be responsible.
Then again I do not know how much difference it makes if a garment has 5, 6 or 7 per
cent of some man-made fibre. I think, speaking from memory, that there are 15 to 20 or
more man-made fibres which are blended
with other textile fibres in making textiles.
Some of them may be put there to give a
"feel", as we say in the textile trade, to that
particular garment. It may or may not
enhance the wear; very often it does. Yet I
question whether the ultimate consumer-I
refer particularly to the ladies, who do most

SENATE DEBATES
of the purchasing-would know just what it
means if these garments are labelled.
This brings up another very important subject. Does this label have to be sewn on the
garment? Can it be attached to the garment,
or can it be marked on a polyethylene bag, or
some other container in which the garment is
packed? One manufacturer who makes a lot
of yarn for knitting, some of which is very
expensive and some that we call utility yarn
at a reasonably low price, puts it in bundles
of approximately six pounds. There are four
skeins to the pound and in others five skeins
to the pound. Can he put that marking on the
outside of the package, or must he go to the
expense of putting a label on every single
skein of yarn? It may be of value to the
consumer, but it is certainly going to cost the
consumer a lot more money. I do not think
that is the intention of the bill, but most
manufacturers I have talked to feel that it is.
Again, with respect to the question of
labels or trades, one manufacturer who has a
large business pointed out to me that in
ordering their bags or labels that they sew or
attach to the garment, to get a price they
order perhaps a year's supply at one time.
Now, if this act should come into force within
the next year or four months he would lose
many hundreds of dollars which he must of
course, recover from the ultimate consumer.
We have another serious problem, which
goes back to the inspection. There are tens of
thousands of dealers throughout Canada, large
and small, who sell something or other that
contains textiles. How in the world are these
inspectors going to check into retail stores?
It would take thousands of inspectors a long
while and involve much expense to train
them. I do not think it is clear in the bill, it is
not to me and it certainly is not to the three
manufacturers I talked to, just how this
inspection is going to work. That is why I am
bringing this matter to your attention, honourable senators, so that you can give it considerable thought and decide just what is the
best way of handling it.
With respect to marking, one man pointed
out to me that his small company makes one
and a half million pairs of footlets, which
ladies wear inside their shoes. There are quite
a number of fibres contained in those. If he
has to label them it is going to cost him a lot
of money. If he has to print them it is going
to make it a very ungainly looking article.
The labels have to be sewn on. He showed me
his figures indicating that it will cost proba[Hon. Mr. Blois.]

February 10, 1970

bly two or three cents more a footlet. When
the retailer gets these he has to add his profit
to that, so the ultimate consumer would be
paying 5, 10 or 15 cents a pair more. These
are things which I think should be considered
very carefully before this bill is passed.
Another man referred to a little sock which
he makes. If he had to put a label on some of
those, it would be almost as large as the sock
itself. On the other hand, if he prints it on it
would look so bad that people would not
want to buy them. I know we are trying to
protect the consumer, but did the people who
drew up this bill consult the textile industry?
Did they realize what it means? I think we all
want to do what we can to save the consumer. Few of us would know what it means.
There may be a cotton core in other textile
yarns coupled with wool or some other
fabric. This strengthens the material, yet the
ultimate consumer might think that if the
material is not all wool it is not good. However, this combination will outwear wool.
I myself have had experience with putting
in 5 or 7 per cent of some man-made fibre
blended with something else, which enhances
the textile strength by anywhere from 10 to
25 per cent. It improves the wearing quality
and makes the product feel better. How are
we going to find the average consumer, who
feels that an all-wool garment is all it means?
It is better, but what they do not know is
that you can make it all wool or pure wool
but only a quarter of an inch in length. A
pure wool garment will probably be two or
three inches in length.
I have mentioned a few of these things
because I do not think that this bill will do
what we expect it to do. I think we should go
into this matter very carefully. I would ask
honourable senators to give very careful
thought before this bill becomes law.
Hon. Josie D. Quart: Honourable senators, I
agree with the remarks of Senator Blois, who
certainly knows much more about the textile
industry than I do, but I have no hesitation
whatsoever in supporting Bill S-20, for I
believe it is assuredly a forward step to protect the Canadian consumer. However, it
would seem logical that section 6, which deals
with labelling of each product, et cetera,
should include some specific details as to the
cleaning method to be used for these new
fabrics.
Before the advent of synthetic fibres, the
buyer could choose from fabrics made of
wool, cotton, linen or silk. But with over 2,000

February 10, 1970

SENATE DEBATES

trade names on the market, how can the
average man or woman know which fabrie
can be cleaned, and by what method? We
consumers as a rule are fairly reasonable and
do not complain too much, but it is only
logical that the buying public should know
what to expect and whether a fabric is delicate and must be hand-washed or should be
dry cleaned. So frequently we just guess at
how to care for our purchases and very often
suffer the consequences with textiles labelled
"washable". Many manufacturers give the
detailed cleaning instructions on nicely printed hang-tags which, if they ever reach the
consumer are promptly detached from the
garment, and are destroyed or misplaced.
Therefore, it would seem to be a logical next
step that instructions be
permanently
attached to the garment by means of a sewnin label.
Again it is important to consumers that the
proposed mandatory labelling legislation
apply to the whole article, not just the major
component. If a garment is composed of two
or more fabrics, each one must meet the
required standard for the cleaning method
recommended. Hopefully this care-labelling
will eliminate the horrors of the sbrinking
interlining, colour in the trimming, rusting
buttons or a disintegrating belt. A garment
labelled as dry-cleanable might also be washable, but unless the label indicates that it is,
you will wash it strictly at your own risk, be
it drip-dry or wash-and-wear. Many consumers have been misled either by sales persons
or labels on textiles on garments to the point
where purchases become a total loss.
I repeat that mandatory labelling protects
the customer, and the customer is always
right according to the retailers' credo. But we
al realize that the retailers' benevolent
philosophy is to keep the customer happy
when on a spending spree.
I take this opportunity to congratulate the
Canadian Association of Consumers. This
association is performing a wonderful service
to the public, and unquestionably their resolutions, which cover a wide range of consumer goods, have been of great assistance to the
Government when drafting bills.
I was very happy to hear the sponsor of the
bill (Hon. Mr. Phillips, Rigaud) say that Bill
S-20 will be welcomed particularly by the
women of this country, who largely bear the
responsibility for purchasing the family
requirements in clothing and other household
textile articles. Yes, indeed, it is a recognized
21498-34j

fact that women are the nation's purchasing
power. The majority of the advertising slogans, eye-catching posters, TV commercials
and newspaper advertisements are designed
to attract the attention of women, and wise
men admit that purchasing is an art in which
women excel. They invade even the exclusive
shops for men only, and haberdashers and
tailors will tell you that a great number of
men bring their wives along to protect them
from the super-salesmen.
And what about the old joke about ties?
For example, when the man of a certain vintage in a gay or frivolous moment buys a
psychedelic tie, if chided by his friends that
the cravat is so loud it shrieks to high
heaven, with a shrug of his manly shoulders
and with diplomatic resourcefulness he poses
as a victim wearing the tie in order to please
the little woman, when in reality she is not
guilty of buying it and blinks every time he
wears it. But women do not pay any attention
to these stale "tie jokes". After ail, we have
compensation as the nation's spenders.
I cannot but wonder if the textile industry suffered from the dictates of fashion
designers since the mini-skirts hit the market.
Certainly the garment industry must have
reaped a rich harvest, for it seemed that the
higher the skirts went the higher the cost to
the customer. It is probable that the textile
manufacturers used great pressure on the
world of fashion couturiers which gave birth
to the maxi-coats for men and women.
I should like to place on record one of the
resolutions the Canadian Association of Consumers sent to the Department of Consumer
and Corporate Affairs, contained in their
1969-70 report dealing with textiles and
labelling:
Whereas sound information is seldom
available at the time of purchase,
thereforeBe it resolved that CAC request the
Department of Consumer and Corporate
Affairs to establish regulations requiring
that textile products be labelled with the
generic name of the fibre or fibres, trade
name, and basic care information and
that the label be permanently affixed in a
readily accessible place, to the product or
its container.
I shall be very happy to support this bill.

Therefore, the body of the statute would have
to be read in the light of the regulations. The
regulations plus the statute would then give
one the opportunity of expressing an opinion,
but as to the regulations wbich. are provided
for in the statute and conternplated by the
statute it would be impossible to draw aniy
inference.
Hon. Mr. Biais: As I understand the regulations, when this bil is passed a manufacturer
today would flot know what the regulations
are going to be and he might as well fold up
and go out of business.
Hon. Mr. Phillips (Rigaud): I would say
that the act which cornes into force as
indicated by section 18 is provided ini the
usual manner. When the act is brought into
force on a day flxed by proclamation, I wouid
assume that the regulations would have been
drafted and published sa that immediately
upon the statute coming into effeet the regulations would then be available for ail to
read. Therefore, the regulations, with the
statute, would clarify the situation.
Hon. Mr. Blais: I was under the impression,
as 1 read the act, that régulations rnight be
made at any lime. The minister could exempt
or add or change, and I think that is the
danger.
Hon. Mr. Phillipa (Rigaud): Power is usually given for the passing of regulations giving
effect to the statute or modifications or revision of the regulations as long as legally the
regulations are witbin the framework of the
statute and for the purpose of giving effect to
the statute. No regulations would have any
legal validity if it were extraneous in substance ta the subject matter of the legislation
as passed.
Hon. Mr. Grosarf: Is the honourable senator
saying that we cannot understand this bill
until we see the regulations, which are not
before us?
Hon. Mr. Phillips (Rigaud): No, I did nat
say that. I simply said it is provided within the statute itself that regulations will
be passed, for instance, with respect to the
mandatary aspect of certain familles of manmade fibres which will be prescribed as I
indicated when I first introduced the bill.
There will be approximately 16 familles of
man-made fibres and these will be cavered by
regulations. Therefore, until you have the
regulations pursuant ta section 6 of the act,
we do not know to what fibres or wbat fami-

lies of fibres the rnandatory regulations wiil
apply. There will also be regulations applicable in those cases where there has been
voluntary suýbiission, as previously explained. They are based upon the decision
of the merchant himself, whether hie be a
manufacturer, importer, dealer or retailer.
When be voluntarily submits bis article ta
labelling bie will be bound by specified regulations pursuant to the terms of this act, and
under the authority that wilI be given ta the
minister under this act.
Han. Mr. Grosari: Perhaps the senator will
inform the bouse, in view of the fact that
be bas raised the question of regulations,
if in bis opinion as a textile lawyer for many
years tbe interpretation section of the act
would apply ta tbe body of the act and/or ta
the regulations.
Hon. Mr. Phillips (Rigaud): The interpretation section wouId apply basicaily ta the body
of the act. The réguilations are supplementary
and complementary ta the statute proper.
May I be allawed, Senator Grasart, ta
answer Senator Biais on two or tbree other
points? The third question I wanted ta answer
was with respect ta the number of textile
articles that will be covered by tbe regulations on account of the frernendous number
wbich Senator Blois apparently referred ta. I
arn sorry tbat I did not make myseif clear
on that when I explained the bill an secand

the normal, natural product, such as cotton,

'Unless the man-made articles f ail witbin the

ta be covered by the regulations, such
other man-made fabrics will not be subject to

exempt? I bave been in the business ail my
life and I cannot understand wbo is going
ta decide which man-made fibres will be
recorded and which will not.
Han. Mr. Phihhips (Rigaud): The statute
specifically says that it will be covered by
regulations. If -this bill is passeci into law it

SENATE DEBATESFeray0.10
will give authority to the minister by order
in coundil to specify the generic family of
man-made fibres. Once they are so specified in
a group of 16 families the regulations will
apply to these prescribed items. The word
"prescribed" has a specific connotation in the
interpretation section of the act. It is specifically stated that there are prescribed articles
which will be covered by utinisterial decision
i respect te which there will be mandatory
regulations. There will then be regulations in
respect of voluntary submiission on the part of
merchants who, desire to label their products.
That is ail that I can say to you on that point,
Senator Blois.
Lastly, and not to burden the house unduly
on the question of who is responsible with
respect to, shall we say, the fraudulent submission of an article to the public, as I
indicated, the sections of the bul dealing with
sanctions and covering the indictable offences
and the fines, et cetera, follow the general
rule of law in that criminal offences are being
created, and it is pursuant to the authority
given to the federal Parliament to deal with
cruninal law that these offences are created.
In the ordinary rule o! criminal law you
always have the necessity of an animus
furandi, the intent to commit a crime, and if
you do not have present the jutent to commit
a crime and such intent is not established
against the accused, presumably the judicial
process will not lead to conviction of the
accused.
The mere fact that a merchant, whether hie
be importer or retailer, will sell an article
which is tainted, i the sense of not being
properly labelled, obviously does not mean
that the person who unintentionally disposes
of the article would be guilty of a criminal
offence. I had hoped that I had made this very
clear in my speech when I indicated that the
burden of proof was upon the Crowu in order
to establish the guiît of the accused, if, as and
when such accused is brought before the
criminal courts.
Honourable senators, I think that basically
those are the major points the honourable
Senator Blois raised. Would he be good
enough to tell me if there are any others in
respect of which hie would like an answer aud
which I might have overlooked.
Hon. Mr. Blois: Thank you.
Motion agreed to and bil read second time.

REFERRED TO COMMITTEE

On motion of Hon. Mr. Philips (Rigaud),
bill referred to the Standing Senate Committee on Banking, Trade and Conmmerce.
RAILWAY ACT
BILL TO AMEND-SECOND READING-DEBATE
CONTINUED

The Senate resumned from Tuesday, February 3, the adjourned debate on the motion of
Hon. Mr. Burchili for second reading of Bill
C-11, to amend the Rallway Act.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Honourable senators, I wish
to yield to honourable Senator Fournier
(Madawaska-Restigouche).
The Hon. the Speaker: Is it so agreed?
Hon. Senators: Agreed.
Hon. Edgar Fournier: Honourable senators,
I wish to say a few words on Bill C-11, an act
to amend the Railway Act. The bil was wefl
explained by Senator Burchili, who has had
long experience in the telephone and telecommunications service. No one could be
better qualified than hie to give an explanation. I hope the explanation hie gave-naturally it was the explanation hie received
from Canadian National officials-is a little
better than the explanation we received from
the Canadian National when they decîded to
remove the passenger services fromn the transcontinental lime.
As you know, after two months of waiting I
finally got an answer to my notice of inquiry,
which is the key answer to some of the
problems which we are facing.
First, I would like to put on the record
of this house a few lines taken from the
report of the proceedings of the Standing
Senate Committee on Transport and Communications, dated December 18, 1969. It has
to do with my notice of inquiry. At this
point Mr. Vaughan and I had some difficulties, and I was trying to get an answer to
my notice. I would like to put this on the
record because it opens up a lot of avenues,
and 1 think it throws light on the matter. Mr.
Vaughan is speaking, and I quote:
Now, on the abandonments, the Canadian Transport Commission is the authority.
On the changes under the Railway Act,
under section 315 of the Railway Act,
there is an obligation on the carriers to
provide suitable and adequate service. If,

jurisdiction to deal with that. But
Canadian National feels that it has an
obligation to deal with this situation,
because we should flot perpetuate a
money-losing service when it is flot our
function to disperse or allocate public
resources i that fashion. That train you

MR. VAUGHAN:

The report stating that I arn satisfied must be

Honourable senators, as I said, It opens a
lot of avenues. You have received Hansard of
February 3, stating that the notice of inquiry

These figures show that the Ocean earned

correct in the answer to my inquiry are as
follows, and I quote:
With reference to the statistics shown
below, it is pointed out that the principal
carryings of the three trains are for
destinations along the South Shore of the
St. Lawrence, Northeastern New Brunswick, Moncton and east.

Tihis is true for two trains, the Chaleur and
the Scotian. They do not include in their
answer to the inquiry so far as the Ocean is
concerned, the distance along the South Shore
of the St. Lawrence River and northwestern

SENATE DEBATES
in the answer to question 3. I will read it to
you:
In accordance with the recently issued
costing order of the Canadian Transport
Commission the average cost per mile per
train is approximately $12.
It is very difficult to assess the $12 per mile,
and it was interesting to find out what were
direct charges and what parts went to overhead. If the cost is $12 per mile and the route
of the Transcontinental to Edmundston is
shorter by 41 miles, then there is a saving
of $12 per mile, which is a total of $480, if my
figures are correct. At two trains per day,
that comes to $960, ahnost $1,000 a day. This
is the saving achieved by using the shorter
route. However, this fact is not mentioned.
Another thing which I shall not say is misleading but is very hard to understand, relates to question 4. The answer given reads
as follows:
The following figures are based on
ticket lifts made for a sample low-traffic
week (November 3-9, 1968) and a highpeak traffic week (July 6-12, 1969).
Now, honourable senators, these are the
times given here. Then you have your coloured
tickets, the white, the red and the blue. But
then you find out that none of these weeks
mentioned here coincides with the ticket
values as outlined in the schedule. Actually
the high peak traffic is frorn December 19 to
January 11. It is mentioned here that July 6
to 12 is a high peak traffic period, but as a
Canadian I would say that the peak week is
around July 1-probably June 28 to July 8.
However, these are not very serious matters.
I am inclined to believe through some of
my conversations with top executives on
occasion that they are very poorly informed
on the details of such matters. I found that
information is sometimes supplied by young
economists or so-called experts who have
very little knowledge of business except the
manipulation of pencils. I might add that
information given to the public and to several
regional organizations by some C.N.R. officials, on the removal of adequate passenger
services from the central region of the Province of New Brunswick is nothing short of a
sad bloody mess. This information has been
an eye opener so far as the efficiency of the
administration of the C.N.R. is concerned.
Misleading and doubtful misrepresentation
has left the population of the area in question
in a state of turmoil and in an angry mood.
While none of us pretend to know anything
about the operation of railways, nevertheless
[Hon. Mr. Fournier (Madawaska-Restigouche).]

February 10, 1970

we cannot accept the label of stupidity given
to us by some railway officials. We were told
by some of the officials that the Ocean Limited was not paying, and I have just used the
answer to my inquiry to show that the situation is in fact otherwise.
Honourable senators, yet another mistake
has been made in this whole scheme. Before
we had the Ocean Limited, we had a train
called the Cabot which was put on before our
Centennial year. The Ocean Limited for
northshore people is a name with tradition. It
bas been in their minds for at least fifty years.
When you mention the Ocean Limited to
northshore people, either to speak for it or
against it, it is rather like talking about
the sacred cow in India-you cannot touch it.
It was a mistake to change the Cabot to the
Ocean Limited. The name Ocean Limited
should have been left to the northshore, and
we would not have the turmoil we have today.
I think this was a long planned political
manoeuvre in which some C.N.R. officials of
Moncton and Campbellton played a very
important role together with the Minister of
Veterans Affairs who, after the new electoral
boundaries were established, is no longer the
representative of Madawaska-Restigouche, but
representative of Restigouche only and the
City of Campbellton. In my view the minister
has played a leading role in all this.
Honourable senators, I am not going to bore
you with a long list of figures, but I do want
to draw your attention again to the saving of
41 miles at $12 per mile which, if you multiply
it by 365, gives a saving of approximately
$350,000 per year, which is a sizable amount
of money.
In order to give us some kind of service,
and this again is something I cannot understand, the C.N.R. has attempted to give us a
Budd car or rail-liner. But here they have to
use two cars from Edmundston because they
are not dependable. One car would be enough
but they have to add on a spare car behind
and keep the motor running although it has
no passengers and has locked doors. It is a
long run, most of it out in the woods, and
they have to use two cars.
So they have to use two Budd cars from
Moncton to Edmundston; they have to use
two Budd cars from Edmundston to Montreal.
I understand these cars are employed on a
rental basis. I presume they are fairly expensive to rent, and certainly with the number of
passengers patronizing this service at the
moment it does not make it pay because they
are running about half full.

February 10, 1970

SENATE DEBATES

People are angry; people are cursing the
railway because they removed the train.
People agree there is no need to have three
trains on the northshore and not one running
in central New Brunswick. After four years'
experience the facts are available and are on
record that it is paying, so they cannot deny
that any more. There is absolutely no saving
involved in removing it from central New
Brunswick and putting it on the North Shore
route, which is 41 miles longer. We do not
swallow it that easily. The railways know
very well they have a route between Moncton
and Saint John with a Budd car service
which costs them practically half a million
dollars a year. And that is a very short run.
This service they are trying to make us swallow now is going to be one of the most expensive passenger services in Canada-no one
can deny that-and it is not going to survive
for very long. I am inclined to believe, and I
am not the only one, that it was put there to
serve a purpose, so that they will be able to
come back to us and say that it does not pay.
And they will be right, because it will not
pay the way it is being run now. They have
lost the people of the Gagetown area because
Gagetown no longer has access to the C.N.R.
service, and they travel by C.P.R.
The revenue from Moncton to Campbellton
covers four counties-Kent, Northumberland,
Gloucester and Restigouche. The total population is 190,000 and the total revenue $148,600.
In the Edmundston region, the line which has
been removed, there are six countiesQueens, Sunbury, York, Carleton, Victoria and
Madawaska. The total population is 177,800
and the revenue is $173,900. So the revenue
was about 16 per cent higher than in the
other section. I do not where this will lead to.
The superintendent of the Moncton division
met the mayors of the cities in Fredericton
last week and he gave them some drastic
figures. Personally, I am one of those who
cannot understand the statement of Mr.
Vaughan in which he says that the Canadian
National will save $4 million by removing the
Ocean Limited from the trans-continental run
and putting it on the North Shore run. It is
impossible. This is why, if I come back shortly with more notices of inquiry, you should
not be surprised. I intend to keep working on
this matter in the interests of my own people.
I am not trying to get anything out of the
C.N.R.
There was a statement made in the Campbellton office to which I object very strongly,
but I will not go into that now. I am not going
to stand idle and be told false representations

made by officials of Canadian National. If
they give me the facts that prove I am wrong
in my statements, I will gladly apologize, very
honestly and sincerely, but I will never do
that unless I am proved wrong.
Hon. Mr. Martin: I wish the Leader of the
Opposition would take that position!
Hon. Mr. Fournier (Madawaska-Restigouche): Based on the information that was given
to us, even lately, it cannot be justified. I do
not know how they juggle these figures.
When the Ocean Limited or the Scotian or
the Chaleur arrives in Moncton it is full.
Then from Moncton it goes through Edmundston and pick up the odd 60, 75 or 100 passengers, without any additional cost, and then
you join the main line at Joffre for Levis or
Quebec and on to Montreal. This is very hard
to understand.
I said a while ago that I thought there were
too many "fils à papa" employed by the railway with sharpened pencils and very little
experience trying to justify their positions. I
regret such situations exist, and I have no
hesitation in calling it a bloody mess because
it is a bloody mess.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Honourable senators, I
move the adjournment of the debate. In doing
so, I inform the house that I will not discuss
the problems of New Brunswick and the
C.N.R.!
Hon. Mr. Fournier (Madawaska-Restigouche): You should!
On motion of Hon. Mr. Haig, debate
adjourned.
BUSINESS OF THE SENATE
Hon. Paul Martin: Honourable senators,
Senator Cameron sent word that he hoped to
be here despite the bad weather that has held
him up in Montreal. In this way he could
have proceeded with item No. 4. However, he
has not reached Ottawa. We have no alternative now but to proceed with that matter on
Thursday next.
Likewise, we had hoped to proceed with
the debate on item No. 3, the setting up of a
Special Joint Committee on the Constitution,
but two senators who had indicated their
intention of taking part in the debate have also been detained, I presume as a result of the
bad weather. So it is intended that we will
consider this item with the others on Thursday. If it is possible, we should conclude our
consideration of item No. 3 on Thursday. In

530

SENATE DEBATES

any event we will proceed with it on Thursday when I understand Senator Fournier
(Madawaska-Restigouche)
and
Senator
Yuzyk, among others, propose to speak.
We have had to take into account not only
the weather conditions, but the general
availability of business for tomorrow, and the
fact that a number of committees are sitting.
The Special Committee of the Senate on
Mass Media will be sitting three times tomor-

Banking, Trade and Commerce, after considering three bills will continue its study of
the White Paper on Taxation.
In the light of these facts perhaps we
should not sit tomorrow. We shall, however,
resume our sittings on Thursday at 2 o'clock

EXPROPRIATION BILL
SECOND READING-DEBATE

AD.TOURNED

Hon. Earl W. Urquhart moved the second
reading of Bull C-136, respecting the Expropriation of Land.
He said: Honourable senators, Bil C-136 is
a long and a compllcated bill. It outllnes an
entirely new procedure for expropriation of
land for federai purposes because the existing
law on the subject la found mainly under the
Expropriation Act, chapter 106, Revised Statutes of Canada 1952, and has remained substantiaily unchanged since its enactment in
1886. There la therefore littie wonder that this
ancient and arbitrary law of expropriation,
which, was born in an agrarian society more
than eighty years ago, is in its present form
entirely unsuited to the complexities and
realities of our modern urban life.
This legisiation wml apply to ail federal
departmnents of government and to expropriations by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, the National Capital Commission, the
National Harbours Board and the St. Lawrence Seaway Authonity. It will not, however,
extend to interprovincial. railways or to private companies under speclal acts which
exercise special expropriation powers. The
Governinent plans to deal separately with

these situations ini the future, including the
Canadian National Railways and the Canadian Pacific Railway.
This bil provides for expropriation by the
Crown for a public work or a public purpose
and ail expropriations shall corne under one
minister, the Minister of Public Works.
In explaining the principles o! this bill on
second reading, 1 do flot propose to go into
great detail because I will, foilowing the
second reading, move that the bill be referred
to the Standing Senate Committee on Legal
and Constitutional Affairs. I propose therefore
to give the higblights of the new principles
embodied in the bill and provide some detail
in explanation o! these hlghlights.
The first change in the law relating to
expropriation which this bill provides for is
as to the requirement o! public notice of intention to expropriate. Under the present
law, the federal Goverament can expropriate
in an arbitrary manner any land or interest
in land without notice to the owner or the
tenant. Indeed, many owners in the past did
not know that their land was expropriated
until after the expropriation documents were
registered in the local registry office.
This bill drasticaily changes that procedure
and requires that the Crown give a notice of
intention to expropriate. The notice of intention to expropriate shail be, (a) registered in
the local registry office; (b) published in a
local newspaper within 30 days after its registration in the registry office; (c) sent by registered mail to any person whose interest
against the property appears in the local registry office; and, (d) subsequentiy published inx
the Canada Gazette.
I should add that the notice of intention to
expropriate must contain a statement as to
the right o! the owner or any person to object
to the expropriation; it must describe the
property to be taken, and indicate the public
work or public purposes for which the land la
required.
Under this procedure, the veil o! secrecy
that presently surrounds intended expropriations will be lifted. Under this legisiation ail
expropriations will be above board.
The bull further requires that there be a
public hearing before expropriation. Under
the present law, an owrner or tenant of propertyr has no recognized legal right to object to
the expropriation of bis property-no right
whatsoever. Under this bull Ën owner, tenant,
or any other person may object to the expropriation within 30 days by writing a letter

SENATE DEBATES
and sending it by registered mail to the minister setting forth the following information:
(a) the nature of his objections; (b) the
grounds on which the objections are based;
and (c) the nature of his interest in the
matter.
The Attorney General of Canada will
appoint a Hearing Officer, who must not be a
public servant, to hear the objections and
report within 30 days to the Minister of
Public Works. The person or persons who
have raised the objections are entitled to be
paid the cost of asserting the objections to the
extent that the Hearing Officer deems them
reasonable. If the minister decides to confirm
the expropriation and expropriate the property he must, at the request of a person who
objected, furnish him with a copy of the
Hearing Officer's report and state his reasons
for not giving effect to his objections.
The bill requires notice of confirmation to
expropriate within 120 days of the notice of
intention to expropriate published in the
Canada Gazette, and the minister must decide
whether he is going to proceed with the
expropriation. If be does not, it is deemed to
be abandoned and the owner is entitled to the
amount of any actual loss sustained by him
while the notice was in effect. If the minister
decides to go ahead with the expropriation
and registers the notice of confirmation of
expropriation, the minister must within 90
days offer an amount estimated to be full
compensation. The offer must be based on a
written appraisal, and a copy of the appraisal
must be sent to the owner along with the
offer. The owner may accept the offer without
prejudice and, if he is not satisfied with the
amount of compensation offered, he can proceed in the Exchequer Court in an attempt to
get a higher amount of compensation.
If the minister does not make his offer
within the required 90 days, in addition to all
other interests the owner is paid 5 per cent
on the compensation from the date when the
offer should have been made to when it was
actually made. The Crown in this instance is
being penalized for being tardy.
Provision is made for negotiation procedure.
Under the present law there is no prescribed
negotiation procedure to assist in the resolution of disputes respecting compensation between the owner of the expropriated property
and the Crown. Under this bill if the owner
and the minister fail to agree on the amount
of compensation within 60 days from the date
the offer was made, then either the owner or
the minister can serve a notice to negotiate
[Hon. Mr. Urquhart.]

February 12, 1870

which stays all proceedings for 60 days from
the date of service of the notice to negotiate.
The minister then refers the matter to a negotiator, who must not be a public servant, who
inspects the property, considers appraisals,
valuations and other evidence with a view to
effecting a settlement of the compensation
payable. The negotiator reports within 60 days
to the minister and all statements made in the
course of these negotiations are necessarily
privileged and will not be admissible in legal
proceedings to determine the compensation
payable.
The bill prescribes principles of compensation. At present the rules that govern the
determination of the amount of compensation
payable are unstated except in the decided
cases. They depend on the rules that have
been determined over the years by the
Exchequer Court of Canada.
The new law will provide a code for determining the compensation payable with the
minimum or base amount being in general
the market value of the property at the time
of its taking. Provision is expressly made to
compensate for any costs or losses incidental
to disturbance, including moving to other
premises and for any element of special economic advantage relating to occupation or use
of the property. Special rules are also included to cover specially designed buildings such
as schools, hospitals and religious institutions
for which there is no general demand or
market.
Holders of security interests and mortgage
interests are also dealt with specifically. In
the case of the expropriation of a residence,
the new law will recognize the right of the
expropriated person to claim as compensation
the cost of relocating his residence in reasonably equivalent premises if the compensation
otherwise payable to him is not sufficient to
enable him to do this. In the case of a tenant,
the length of the term remaining under his
lease, his prospects of obtaining a renewal of
the lease and his investment in the property,
including the nature of any business carried
on by him on the premises, will all be taken
into consideration in determining the compensation payable to him.
All legal appraisal and other costs incurred
by an owner or tenant prior to legal proceedings in the Exchequer Court are payable by
the Crown.
The owner has one year in which to proceed in the Exchequer Court in an attempt to
get more compensation than the money

February 12, 1970

SENATE DEBATES

offered to him after the certificate of confirmation was registered. If the owner gets a
higher award by the court than that offered
to him by the minister, he is entitled to interest on the difference at a rate not less than
the yield from Canadian Treasury bills. If the
offer is less than 90 per cent of the judgment,
he is entitled to additional interest of 5 per
cent on the compensation adjudged payable.
If the judgment of the Exchequer Court is
less than the Crown's offer, the Crown can
recover the difference as a debt due the
Crown.
The bill makes provision with respect to
possession. Under the present law a person
whose property has been expropriated without notice and without a hearing can be
required to give up possession immediately
and prior to the payment of any compensation by the Government. Under this bill the
new law will provide that following the registration of the notice of confirmation to expropriate, each person who is entitled to compensation must be offered within 90 days
thereafter an amount estimated to be his full
compensation, and in addition he must be
given 90 days' notice before actual possession
by the Crown can be achieved. However, if
possession is required on a shorter notice
than 90 days, the Crown must pay additional
compensation to those in occupation at the
rate of 10 per cent of the value of the expropiated property or the compensation payable.
The owner thereby is further reimbursed for
giving up possession before the end of the
90-day period.
The proposed legislation makes certain
provisions respecting abandonment. Under
the present law the Crown can abandon an
expropriation at any time prior to the payment of compensation and without the owner's content. Under this bill a notice of intention to abandon must be sent to all those who
had an interest in the land at the time the
notice of confirmation to expropriate was registered and before compensation is paid. Each
person who had an interest must consent
within 30 days to the abandonment, otherwise
the minister has no authority to abandon. In
other words, if five people are involved, there
must be unanimous consent from all five
before the Crown can abandon the expropriation. If unanimous consent is not obtained,
then the Crown must pay the compensation
and dispose of the land on its own at a later
date.
As the administrative arm of the state
more and more exerts increasing control over
social values and goals, people are demanding

better and greater protection from abuses of
that administrative process. As the Minister
of Justice, the Honourable Mr. Turner, has
said, "This bill strikes a blow for individuals'
rights against the arbitrary power of the
State." In a larger measure, this bill will
achieve equality of access and treatment
before the law for rich and poor alike. It will
achieve a better balance between the right of
the ordinary citizen and the government of
the day. This proposed Expropriation Act,
with its guarantees of the individual's right to
notice, to a hearing, to negotiation, to appeal
and to minimum compensation, will enhance
the power of the individual against the state.
The claimant will be entitled as of right to
have the whole of his costs paid by the Government where the amount awarded to him
by the court exceeds the amount of compensation offered to him by the Government, and
in any other case the awarding of court costs
will be in the discretion of the court. It will
therefore be seen that the new law will make
express provision for the payment of costs to
our citizens who are involved in expropriation cases at three stages, namely, the preexpropriation stage when objections can be
taken to the notice of intention to expropriate
itself, the negotiation stage following the confirmation of an intention to expropriate, and
the litigation stage to which resort may be
had in the event that a negotiated settlement
cannot be achieved.
Honourable senators, this bill strikes a solid
blow against the arbitrary powers of the
state. It is a bill in favour of the citizens of
this country regardless of their wealth or
their social or public standing. I commend
this bill to the favourable consideration of
this chamber.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Pearson, debate

Hon. Allister Grosart: I wonder if the
Leader of the Governinent would explain the

Government's initiative we did flot sit yesterday. It seems rather strange ta me that the
Leader of the Governiment shouid now urge
that this debate 13e continued at this stage
when it could have been continued and finished yesterday. I say that because saine of us

Hon. Mr. Martin: I fuily appreciate the
honourable senatar's indignation, and I knaw
it is a genuine indignation. The reason we did
flot sit yesterday was because there was flot

frain this matter. I had understood, and I
mentianed it on Tuesday night because of
information given ta me by Senatar Grosart,
that Senatar Fournier (Madawaska-Restigouche) and Senatar Yuzyk wouid. speak on this

Senatar Yuzyk last evening and expressed the
hope that he would speak today.

We have heard saine very interesting

Senator Fournier (Madawaska-Restigouche)
this afternaon, and earlier by Senatar Fergusson and ather hanourable senators.

SENATE DEBATES
The question before us now, honourable
senators, is not one which should cause tension between men who are otherwise fully in
tune with one another. I have sought to be
fully in tune with the Opposition as well as
with my own side. I am anxious to see this
joint committee set up, as I am sure we all
are. Senator Flynn in his speech the other
day said the quicker we get going on this the
better. With that view I fully agree.
All I am saying to Senator Yuzyk is that if
he does not f eel he can go on today, it is his
right to adjourn the debate. There is a tradition in this chamber that if a senator moves
the adjournment of a debate, it is respected
under normal circumstances. Therefore, if
that is the case now and he cannot go on
tomorrow, then I think we will have to give
consideration to sitting next week.

SENATE DEBATES

I think we should encourage such a student a
little more than we have in the past. I realize
that nothing can be done at this particular
time, but I hope the next time this act is
amended provision will be made for assistance to the part-time students. It may interest
you to know that in metropolitan Toronto
alone 16,000 students are pursuing studies
towards a degree through the part-time
method.
In 1968, 52,583 part-time students and
92,625 full-time degree students attended
Ontario's provincially assisted universities. In
that year more than 54,000 full-time students
received some assistance from their government.
The part-time degree students have no
access to assistance of any kind and they
have to depend on their own limited
resources. Many of them are working at a
job; some are married and have families. It
has been discovered that their average gross
income is about $8,000, with a heavy concentration in the $5,000 to $6,000 a year bracket.
Many part-time degree students earn as little
as $2,000 a year.
I simply draw this to your attention
because I think this is an important segment
of the student population which is deserving
of encouragement, and I suspect that the
numbers enrolled in part-time degree courses
will increase rather than decrease as time
goes on.
Under the Canada Student Loans Plan,
loans may be obtained only on the basis of
certificates of eligibility issued by the provinces participating in the plan to their own
resident students.
The act contains a provision whereby a
province can opt out of the Canada Student
Loans Plan if it wishes, and the Province of
Quebec elected to do so at the time the plan
was initiated and has received this payment
in each year. All other provinces have participated in the plan, and the Yukon and the
Northwest Territories are also able to issue
certificates of eligibility to territorial residents for purposes of the program.
Eligible students may borrow up to $1,000
in any one academic year, and up to $5,000
over their entire academic career.
In 1964-65, the first year of the program,
42,000 students received loans valued at
something in excess of $26 million. It may
interest you to note the numbers for each
year. In 1964-65, $26.7 million were allocated
under the plan to 42,113 students. In 1965-66,
$36 million were allocated to the program

which was participated in by 51,272 students.
In 1966-67 the amount allocated was $41.1
million, taken advantage of by 63,243 students. In 1967-68 the allocation was $57.9 million, and the participation was 90,371 students. In the year ending June 30, 1969 the
allocation was $66 million, and the participation was 107,000 students. In other words,
there was an increase in the one year-from
1967-68 to 1968-69-of 17,000 students. I suspect that as long as the student explosion
continues we may expect this kind of increase
to continue, though there will be some leveling off before too long.
I am sure honourable senators can see
from the figures that the Canada Student
Loans Plan has played an almost indispensible role in the student program in Canada. In
1964-65, the Canada Student Loans Plan was
the only significant source of student aid
available in participating provinces. During
the intervening years, however, many participating provinces have initiated or have
greatly expanded their own provincial student aid programs, in many cases integrating
them with the Canada Student Loans Plan, so
that financial assistance is provided in a conbination of Canada Student Loans and provincial aid to help deserving students.
Each participating province has identified
an appropriate authority which is responsible
for issuing certificates of eligibility by that
province-usually, the Department of Education or some body set up under it.
Very soon after the implementation of the
plan, it became evident to all parties concerned that it was highly desirable for provinces to co-ordinate among themselves a
number of administrative matters associated
with the effective operation of the plan. To
this end a committee of officials of the federal
and provincial governments, including the
non-participating province, have met regularly in Ottawa since 1964 to develop and continuously review commonly agreed approaches
to a number of administrative matters.
These meetings resulted in a set of criteria
which were approved by all governments
concerned. The first version of these criteria
was published in three parts as an appendix
to Hansard of the other place of June 11,
1965. These three parts consisted of agreed
criteria for determining provincial residence,
for establishing a number of definitions, and
for determining a student's need for financial
assistance. A number of revisions made in
these were published as an appendix to
Hansardof the other place of July 11, 1966.

SENATE DEBATES
I should say at this time that the high
degree of effectiveness which has characterized the Canada Student Loans Plan simply
would not have been achieved without the
whole-hearted participation and initiative of
the provinces at these federal-provincial
meetings and their willingness to work
towards a consensus on the approach to be
followed by all on matters of common concern in the administration of the plan. The
result is a basic student loan facility which is
available to students in al participating provinces for attendance at recognized postsecondary institutions inside and outside
Canada, and which is administered on a uniform, consistent and equitable basis among
provinces, but which still leaves individual
provinces flexibility to deal with factors
operating uniquely within their jurisdictions.
Turning now to the more detailed aspects
of the Canada Student Loans Act, particularly
as they relate to the bill currently before us,
honourable senators will recall that the
Canada Student Loans Act provides a basic
loan provision for each loan year. This basic
loan provision is divided among the provinces, both participating and non-participating, into provincial allocations on the basis of
the interprovincial distribution of the general
population in the 18-to-24 year age group.
The provincial allocation acts as a limit on
the aggregate value of certificates of eligibility which can be issued by a participating
province. The basic loan provision was originally established for the loan year opening on
July 1, 1964, at $40 million, and provision was
made in the act that this be increased in
subsequent loan years by the percentage
increase in the 18-to-24 year-old population
in Canada from year to year. The $40 million
amount proved sufficient overall in the first
loan year, but inadequate in the case of a few
individual participating provinces, and it was
necessary, through the medium of estimates,
to provide special increases for that year.
Early in the second loan year, which commenced on July 1, 1965, it became apparent
that the basic loan provision, which had
increased by a small amount over the first
year, would be inadequate to meet the
demand for loans which would be placed on
it. In June 1966, therefore, amendments
were enacted to the Canada Student Loans
Act which increased the basic loan provision
for the year 1965-66 to $58 million. At the
same time, a supplementary loan provision,
equal to 20 per cent of the basic loan amount
in a loan year, was established which could
[Hon. Mr. Cameron.]

February 12, 1970

be allocated by the Minister of Finance on
the request of a province where the demand
for loans exceeded the available provincial
allocation. This feature was incorporated in
the act because it was recognized that there
was a different relative demand for loans
among participating provinces which could
not be met by dividing the basic loan provision among provinces simply on the basis of
population distribution.
These amendments enabled the Canada
Student Loans Plan to work effectively until
the loan year 1968-69. During the intervening
period the rate of increase in Canadian students attending post-secondary institutions
was some three times greater than that in the
18-to-24 year population age group. This inevitably meant that the growth in demand for
student loans would outstrip the increase in
the basic loan provision from year to year,
and this situation came to a head last year.
The legislative calendar did not provide an
opportunity to introduce amending legislation
to deal with this situation, and once again the
supplementary Estimates were used to provide a temporary solution.
Appropriation Act No. 1, 1969, established
the basic loan provisions for the year 1968-69
at $80 million, and increased the supplementary loan amount from 20 per cent to 21 per
cent of the revised basic loan provision. The
same item also took account of the current
loan year, which commenced last July 1, setting the basic loan amount at $100 million and
increasing the supplementary provision to 30
per cent. No provision was made for the
period beyond June 30 of this year and, in
the absence of legislative action prior to that
time, available allocations for the loan year
1970-71, as they would be determined under
the provisions currently in the act, would be
insufficient. It is primarily for this reason that
we are considering Bill C-135 at this time.
During the period since the Canada Students Loan Act was last amended, a number
of matters have arisen related to conditions
spelled out in the body of the act, which have
caused complications for borrowers and
others in the effective administration of the
program. A number of the amendments in
Bill C-135 are intended to rectify these
matters.
The most significant amendment to be considered will be that dealing with available
allocations for the loan year commencing July
1, 1970, and for subsequent years. In 1970-71
the basic loan provision will be established at
$115 million, a 15 per cent increase over the

February 12, 1970

SENATE DEBATES

current year. For loan years subsequent to
1970-71, the basic loan provision will be
escalated by the percentage increase in total
post-secondary enrolment in Canada in that
year rather than the present increase in
population ages 18 to 24. This will provide for
an escalation factor of from 12 per cent to 15
per cent a year for the next few years, rather
than from 4 per cent to 5 per cent, which
would have been the case under the existing
provisions, and will, at least, allow the basic
loan provision to increase in line with the
post-secondary student population.
In addition to increasing the basic loan
provision, the amendments will make permanent the increase in the supplementary loan
provision which has been implemented for
the current loan year. The supplementary
loan provision will accordingly, from this
year on, be established at an amount equal to
30 per cent of the basic loan provision for a
given year. This will provide greater flexibility in meeting the requirements of provinces
which, for one reason or another, have relatively higher student loan requirements than
others.
At the time the Canada Student Loans Act
was implemented, virtually al students
attending post-secondary institutions did so
on the familiar "academic year" basis; that is,
a faU and winter term followed by a relatively long summer vacation. Accordingly, the
terms and conditions under which individual
students could obtain loans were all related to
the academic year, so defined as a program of
full-time studies of not less than 26 consecutive weeks in duration. The past five years
have seen a considerable growth in a new
form of study program, the trimester or
semester system, in which a student completes a study program which is broken into a
number of distinct semesters, generally three
or four in a year, and to which the traditional
concept of the academic year is not
applicable.
While the students were not excluded from
the benefits of the Canada Students Loan
Plan, a number of complications and problems were encountered by many students.
Amendments are contained in this bill which
will explicitly include students studying on
the trimester system as well as those who
study on the academie year basis. Thus the
full benefit of this program will be made
available to a group of post-secondary students whom it was clearly designed to assist.
Provision is made in the amendments to the
Canada Student Loans Act to enable trust

companies, insurance companies, and mortgage loan companies to apply to the Minister
of Finance for designation as eligible lenders
under the plan. Lenders presently operating
under the plan are ail chartered banks and
certain credit unions who have applied for,
and received, designation as eligible lenders.
This amendment will broaden the classes of
lending institutions to which students can
turn for loans, and will parallel changes made
in the recent past in other guaranteed loan
programs . operated by the Minister of
Finance, namely, the Farm Improvement
Loans Act and the Fisheries Improvement
Loans Act, and those which are proposed in
another bill amending the Small Businesses
Loans Act, currently being considered by
honourable senators.
I should like to interject at this point that
there is one notable omission from the list of
institutions designated as eligible lenders. I
refer to the omission of the treasury branches
of the Province of Alberta. There is no question but that these institutions are financial
institutions. In fact, they are the only banks
operating in many communities. I would suggest that the treasury branches might well
be included in future amending legislation,
otherwise westerners may feel that this is
just another case of discrimination against
the west.
I would like to comment on one last amendment contained in this bill. The existing
provisions of the Canada Student Loans Act
provide that students are eligible for loans if
they are, among other things, Canadian citizens, or are non-Canadians but have lived in
Canada for one year and have indicated that
they intend to make their home in Canada
upon completion of their studies.
The proposal in the bill currently being
considered is to require that persons who are
non-Canadians
have landed
immigrants
status, and have resided in Canada for one
year. The effect of this amendment is simply
to clarify the language presently in the legislation, since it is a condition of obtaining
landed immigrant status that new Canadians
declare their intentions to reside permanently
in Canada. The amendment will therefore in
no way restrict the availability of student
loans to new Canadians.
There are a few other amendments in the
bill, but I do not wish to take up the time of
honourable senators in describing them. The
amendments to which I have not referred are
minor, and are either consequential on one

SENATE DEBATES
or more of the amendments I have already
discussed, or are of a very minor administrative nature.
I may say that if this bill receives second
reading I propose to refer it to the Standing
Senate Committee on Banking, Trade and
Commerce for detailed examination. I suggest
that committee, but I am not sure that it is
the right one. It may be that it should go to
the Standing Senate Committee on National
Finance, but my judgment is that it should be
the former committee.
I wish to take a few minutes to discuss one
aspect of the Canada Student Loans Act
which the Government does not propose to
alter at this time. This relates to the maximum loans which a student may borrow
in any one year and in total. It is proposed
to leave these at $1,000 per academic year
subject to an overall ceiling of $5,000. The
Canada Student Loans Plan was established as a broad general measure in the student aid field. As such it can never meet all
the needs of all students in Canada. It was,
and continues to be, intended to supplement
the resources available to students from their
families as well as from provincial or private
sources of student aid. A reflection of this
fact is that the maximum individual loan
anount did not, even in the first year of the
plan's operation, meet the entire average cost
of a student's attendance at a post-secondary
institution. While it is true that the costs of
education have increased since 1964, so also is
it true, as I indicated earlier, that the
amounts of provincial student aid made available have increased dramatically over this
period, which has acted as an offset to rising
costs.
The maximum loan amounts were carefully
chosen in 1964, with special consideration
being given to the amount which a student
could reasonably be expected to repay upon
graduation. The Government continues to feel
that $5,000 is a realistic figure when viewed
in this context. It has been suggested that the
$5,000 maximum be retained, but that the
$1,000 maximum per year be increased. I
believe, however, that it would be neither
consistent nor logical to increase the one
correspondingly
maximum without also
adjusting the other.
Again may I interject that the situation is
developing today where students are getting
married during their university career. Both
husband and wife have student loans and
find themselves in the position on graduation
with not a $5,000 loan to repay but $10,000.
This is a substantial amount of money for a
[Hon. Mr. Cameron.]

February 12, 1970

young couple starting out in their married
life. The ceiling at the present time is as
reasonable as it is possible for it to be. It
might have to go up later, but after all if
students decide to get married while in university that is their decision and they should
abide by the consequences.
It is my understanding that the provinces
are currently undertaking an intensive and
co-ordinated review of the whole field of student aid. The federal Government has in the
past indicated that it would be pleased to
participate in any such evaluation at the invitation of the provinces. In the present circumstances it would not be appropriate that any
basic change be incorporated into the Canada
Student Loans Act.
It has long been an educational cliché that
any able Canadian student would not be
denied an education only because he could
not afford it. The growth in student aid generally, including the Canada Student Loans
Plan, has in the past five years, I believe,
made this cliché a much more realistic statement of actual conditions.
I would like to say in closing that the Government believes that the Canada Student
Loans Act has an increasingly useful purpose
in aiding tens of thousands of young Canadians to further their education beyond the
secondary school level so as to be better able
to take advantage of the magnificent opportunities which Canada today offers its young
people and to make a greater contribution to
Canadian society which ultimately is of benefit to all Canadians. It is the hope of the
Government that the amendments being considered at the present time will enable the
Canada Student Loans Act to more effectively
achieve these goals. I am confident that when
these amendments are incorporated this will
be the case.
In conclusion and to recapitulate, there are
six main amendments for the year 1970 to
1971, the first of which is to increase the
basic allocation from $100 million to $115
million. Secondly, to make provision to
change the basis of annual escalation from
that of the increase in the 18-to-24 year
group to the percentage total increase in
total post-secondary enrolment in the loan
years 1970, 1971 and subsequently. Thirdly,
to increase the provision for the supplementary loan allocation from approximately
21 per cent to 30 per cent of the basic loan
allocation. Fourthly, to officially extend the
provisions of the act to take care of students
taking their courses under semester or trimester system. Fifthly, to enable trust, insur-

ance and mortgage loan companies to apply
to the minister for designation of eligibility
as lenders. Sixthly, to require students who
are non-Canadian to have landed immigrant
status and to declare their intention to reside
permanently in Canada.
The other amendments are consequential
on these changes. I hope that these amendments will meet with your approval.
Hon. Josie D. Quart: Honourable senators,
may I congratulate Senator Cameron for his
excellent explanation of the bill. I assure him
that I shall be very happy to support it. As I
understand it, this amendment to the Canada
Student Loans Act would further alleviate the
financial burden involved in pursuing one's
formal education beyond secondary school.
With this I am basically in agreement. However, I must confess that I do tend to worry
about these young people for whom we are
making it so comparatively easy to further
their education.
I worry for a number of reasons, the first of
which is that the powers that be in the field
of education seem, for the most part, to have
lost their bearings. Education used to have
one aim and one only-to teach, to impart
maps of structure and of process, to instil the
experience of the past. Its purpose was neither to experiment with adolescent minds for
the benefit of career-building theorists, nor to
replace their parents as the major formative
factor in their character development, nor to
keep them strait-jacketed in artificial prolongations of their childhood for the financial
good of labour unions, professional pressure
groups, "the economy" as a whole, or selfseeking academic mandarins. Therefore, it
was at least able to set standards, to weed out
the unintelligent and indolent, and sometimes
to encourage the creative and inspired. It was
not perfect. Indeed, sometimes it was cruel
and often it was unfair. But its imperfection,
cruelty and unfairness at least leaned toward
intelligence rather than stupidity. Besides, it
neither pretended to be that which it was not,
nor to accomplish that of which it was
incapable.
I worry also when I ponder the influence of
higher education on our society. There is
impressive evidence that our universities are
focal points of decadence.
A study of the generation gap made for
C.B.S. television early in 1969 searched the
attitudes of parents, college youth and noncollege youth towards traditional American
values. It found fair correlation between the
21498-35

attitudes of parents and non-college youth,
but a marked rejection of parental values by
college youth.
The general message of the survey was that
our youth are being drawn away from the
traditional values of their parents and that
the divergence is most marked among university students. This general condition is subject
to varied interpretations. It seems clear, however, that the traditional explanation of "wild
oats" is inadequate. There is more afoot.
Separation from the home environment and
the new obligation ta think for one's self
make the college student very sensitive to
campus influence. He may become an indolent
boor going from one picket line to the next,
or he may be inspired to high achievement.
It is the clear obligation of our universities
to teach respect for truth, to demonstrate in
practice such respect for the truth and to
maintain a climate which promotes respect
for truth. This commitment to truth has been
the hallmark of our civilization.
Truth does not change from generation to
generation. It is the sinew which gives continuity and meaning to human existence. Man
can live without it, but only wretchedly. Its
greatest achievement is in the moral sphere,
although its most famous achievement is in
the physical sphere. In the physical sciences,
the discipline of truth is immediate and drastic. Moral sanctions are as severe, but they
are less apparent. A society in decay is not
aware of its impending extinction.
Too many colleges and universities have
forsaken the discipline of truth. They use it
effectively in the physical sciences but banish
it from behavioural studies to make place for
the sophistries of permissive authorities and
ideological zealots. Thus, the trustees and the
president renounce responsible authority in
the name of democracy. Amoral professors
corrupt our youth in the name of academic
freedom. A claim of open-mindedness is made
to excuse the hiring of teachers whose minds
are closed to truth. The university builds a
climate hostile to truth and rampant with
error.
The cost of education today is staggering.
Colleges, universities, and technical schools,
though heavily subsidized, for the most part
operate with a deficit.
I find myself at present in agreement with
the spirit of this bill which intends to make it
financially possible for more young people to
avail themselves of that advanced training
which they will surely need if they are to

546

SENATE DEBATES

keep off the unemployment roils. However, I
would hasten to point out that large in scale
and overwhelmingly important though it is,
Caaada's education need not be in the financial trouble in which it flnds itself today.
There is a solution. Let us let the business
community help with techaical know-how,
and actual financial support, but let us do it
on a busiaesslike basis. Our institutions of
higher learning are horribly inefficient and
sadly lacking in organizational ability. With
this the business world can surely help us.
Let us find out what it actually costs to rua
an institution of learning. Then let us set up a
systern of scholarships so designed that businessmen will be encouraged to particîpate.
And let us see the schools themselves set up
sound and accurate budgetary systemfs.
In closing, honourable senators, I would say
that I arn supporting this bill because, though
I feel college and university campuses may

must inevitably corne with the Utopian social

and have passed written and oral examinations at a university of the province ini which
hie is located, or have been examined by some
other appropriate body. He should be on cail
whenever needed in that province. I believe
this would avoid the possibility of a hearing
officer being an unqualifled person or merely
a patronage appointment.
Eighth, the value of the property shall be the
market value. If the owner or owners cannot
agree with the hearing officer, a negotiator
shall be appointed. I personally do not see
much advantage in having a negotiator,
because after the hearing officer has heard the
case it seems to me that the owner will have
made up his mind as to what he wants for
the property. So, it becomes a matter for
litigation, and this bill provides that ail cases
shall go to the Exchequer Court. My thinking
is that any superior court would be quaifled
and, indeed, would be better qualifled than
the Exchequer Court, because such courts are
set up in ail the provinces now and are dloser
to and are more knowiedgeable of local
values and conditions.
The ninth and final stage is that before the
owner elects to go to court, he is faced with a
decision. If hie wins his case, his costs are
ailowed by the Crown. On the other hand, if
he loses then it is up to the presiding judge
to assess the costs. If he has to travel ail the
way to Ottawa to appear before the Exchequer Court, these costs may be too high for
hlm to pay. Again, honourable senators, this
is a case where to the rich go the rewards
and to the poor the cruxnbs. This then is the
deterrent, and the little man will usually have
to take what is offered.
I have had a number of batties with expropriation bodies, particularly with provincial
and municipal bodies responsible for highways or roads. Take the case of No. 20 Highway which runs along the Valley of the
Qu'Appelle for about 12 to 14 miles. A
lake prevents it foilowing the valley farther.
In the old horse-and-buggy days the road left
the vailey and followed a winding coulee, on
each side of which was considerable bush. At
the bottom was a smail park used by fishermen who came there by the hundreds to
camp under the shade of the large maples.
These trees, the engineers said, would have to
be cleared so that cars coming down or going
Up through the coulee could see other cars
approaching. I begged them. not to take this
route, but to take a longer run, a haîf mile in
length, along the face of the 250-foot bill,
which could have been done with a very easy
grade. However, one day when I was away on

business, the bush was cut, and the grade up
the coulee was on its way. But now, honourable senators, after 35 years, the highway
department bas changed its mind and has
placed the new highway where I said it
should have gone in the flrst place.
I can cite the case of the Trans-Canada
Highway between Winnipeg and Portage la
Prairie where the location bas, at great
expense and annoyance, been changed three
times. There is also the new four-lane divided
highway between Regina and Saskatoon,
which was planned initially to more or less
follow the C.N.R. It is now being cut right
and left across farms and around towns, ail in
the naine of speed and supposed safety. The
land acquired fromn the farms leaves small
fields and narrow angles ail along the way.
These make great obstacles to farmers, especially with the large machinery that they
have today. It is time that engineers and the
Government wakened Up and used some
conimon sense in the laying out of highways.
We face tremendous problenis in our urban
areas. City streets were laid out in the horseand-buggy days, but now everyone bas a car,
or is about to get one, and is anxious to get
from here to there as quickly as possible so
that hie can sit longer somewhere else, or stay
in bed until a quarter to nine in the morning
instead of rising at 6 or 7 o'clock as he had to
do when hie used the street cars.
As time goes on, we are going to see a great
deal of expropriation. This measure will help,
but it is too restrictive. It bas been drawn up
by backroom lawyers, not by people with
practical experience. However, I amn going to
support it, but I hope some amendments will
be proposed before too long.
Hon. Mr. Phillips (Rigaud): Honourable
senators, I move that this debate be
adjourned until the next sitting of the Senate.
Han. Mr. Graeart: Honourable senators,
before the adjournment question is put, may I
direct a question to the honourable sponsor of
the biil, Senator Urquhart. I should like to ask
if all the Crown corporations described in the
Financial Administration Act come under the
provisions of this bill, or, to put the question
in another way, are there any Crown corporations which have the power of expropriation--other than the corporations and the
Canadian National Railways, mentioned by
the sponsor-which are not covered by this
bill.
Han. Earl W. Urquhart: Honourable senators, this bill, as I pointed out when 1

SENATE DEBATES
explained it, will apply to all federal departments of Government, and to expropriations
by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation,
the National Capital Commission, the National Harbours Board, and the St. Lawrence
Seaway Authority. It will not apply to the
Canadian National Railways or to the
Canadian Pacific Railway. Those will be dealt
with later, as the Minister of Justice has
indicated in the House of Commons. The bill
also does not apply to private companies such
as pipeline companies, who have special
powers of expropriation under their special
acts which gave them expropriation authority
in the first instance.
Hon. Mr. Grosart: My question related to
other Crown corporations such as Central
Mortgage and Housing Corporation, Eldorado
Nuclear Limited, Polymer Corporation Limited, the National Gallery of Canada, etc. I do
not know whether they have powers of
expropriation, but perhaps the honourable
sponsor of the bill will take my question as
notice and answer when he closes the debate.
Hon. Mr. Urquhart: If my honourable
friend would look at Schedule B at page 42 of
the bill, he will see the corporations enumerated there. It includes those I listed a few
moments ago.
Hon. Mr. Grosart: Do any of the corporations not included in the schedule have
expropriation powers?
Hon. Mr. Urquhart: I think they do. I have
not examined all the other acts and I do not
know if they all have special powers, but I
imagine they have. I am pointing out that this
bill relates to those specific Crown corporations which I have enumerated. I mentioned
that it did not apply to the Canadian National
Railways or the Canadian Pacific Railway. I
will have to check further as to the others to
which you refer.
Hon. Mr. Grosart: I read the honourable
senator's speech and Schedule B. My question
Is, do Crown corporations other than those
in the bill have the power of expropriation?
Perhaps the honourable senator will inquire
and answer later.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Phillips (Rigaud),
debate adjourned.
CONSTITUTION OF CANADA
PROPOSED JOINT COMMITTEE

The Senate resumed from Friday, February
13, the debate on the motion of Hon. Mr.
[Hon. Mr. Urquhart.1

February 17, 1970

Martin, that the Senate do unite with the
House of Commons in the formation of a joint
committee of both bouses to examine and
report upon proposals on a number of subjects related to the Constitution of Canada.
Hon. Paul Yuzyk: Honourable senators, the
debate in the Senate on the proposed special
joint committee of both houses to study and
report upon recent and future proposals related to the Constitution of Canada is drawing
to a close.
In general, the senators who participated in
this debate gave wholehearted approval to the
establishment of such a committee. There
were several suggestions to improve the
regional representation of its membership and
to include at least one woman, who could
represent the interests of approximately half
of the population. There can be no doubt that
if these suggestions were implemented, the
Senate section of this committee would play a
more effective role in the review of our
Constitution.
The three federal-provincial conferences
dealing with the Constitution have made
some progress in this direction, however less
than what the public had expected. It became
evident that if a global revision was to be
achieved there would have to be a more
extensive involvement of the whole country.
Hitherto, it was the federal and provincial
governments which had taken the initiative
and set the machinery in motion. From the
higher level these discussions and proposals
must necessarily come down to the Parliament and the people, who must approve the
final decisions.
Under our democratic system, in the final
analysis, it is the citizens who must decide
the matter of the Constitution. The more they
take part in the discussions, the more meaningful will the Constitution be to them.
Consequently, I am of the opinion that a joint
parliamentary committee that will hold hearings accessible to all people and groups of
people in various parts of Canada is preferable to a royal commission. I believe that
members of a parliamentary committee, after
the completion of the task, would be more
responsible in defending important recommendations in Parliament and in watching
that these will be properly carried out and
maintained. A parliamentary committee acts
more swiftly and is much less expensive than
a royal commission.
A glance at our history will reveal that
since Canada came under British rule, the

February 17, 1970

SENATE DEBATES

British Parliament enacted four different constitutions for this country. The Quebec Act of
1774, which as a counter-action to the American Revolution guaranteed definite rights to
French Canadians, lasted 17 years and was
replaced by the Constitutional Act of 1791,
which divided the country into Upper and
Lower Canada with separate administrations.
Then 49 years later, in 1840, the Act of Union
was passed shortly after the unsuccessful William Lyon Mackenzie and Papineau Rebellions; this act united the two Canadas under a
unitary form of government. Subsequently, 27
years later, in 1867, due partially to threats
from groups in the United States, the British
Parliament passed the British North America
Act, providing Canada with a federal system
of government based on democratic rights of
the people. Known as the Canadian Confederation, it united other former British colonies
and provided for the establishment of new
provinces.
The British North America Act, which has
been our Constitution for 103 years, has
undergone many changes, for during this
period there have been at least 30 constitutional amendments giving us full control over
all our own affairs-hence independence and
sovereignty. It should be noted that Canadians won their freedom, independence and
sovereignty, not through revolution, although
abortive rebellions took place in 1837, but
through the process of evolution. We are
among the several large countries of the
world with a federal system, and these countries enjoy the highest standard of living in
the world. The Soviet Union, a federal state,
is the exception, but it should be noted that it
operates under a totalitarian form of
government.
We must not forget that most countries,
such as France, the United States, the
U.S.S.R. and many others, created their constitutions dramatically in the wake of revolutions with bloodshed. We must bear in mind
that Canada, however, inherited the British
tradition, and our Constitution, the British
North America Act, came as a result of long
and arduous discussions over a period of
three years by Canadian parliamentarians,
the founding fathers, who were not under any
kind of threat of internal violence or coercion
from Britain or the United States. Firm
negotiation and reasonable compromise were
the methods employed to draw up the Constitution and bring about the subsequent
amendments, always in times of peace. This is
essentially our way of life.
21498-36

Yet it must be remembered that the British
North America Act is in fact a colonial statute, passed by the British Parliament in
London over a hundred years ago. There is no
doubt that it is out of tune with modern
times. The situation in our country has drastically changed, for in the hundred years we
have evolved from a preponderantly stable
agricultural society to a vast industrialized,
technological, urbanized and affluent society
active in world affairs, and as a result our
needs have greatly changed. Even if some of
the provisions require little or no change, it
is obvious that new provisions are required to
meet new needs, and a general overall revision to improve the document is necessary.
It was the preparations for and the celebration of the Canadian Centennial which stimulated a general public interest in the Constitution. At the same time increasing difficulties
arose between the federal Government and
the provincial governments regarding powers
of jurisdiction with respect to new problems
of the new society that had emerged. The
"quiet revolution" of the early 1960s in
Quebec drew attention to the problems of
Quebec, particularly to the place of the
French province and the French Canadians in
Confederation, and to its powers and jurisdiction and their rights as stipulated in the Constitution, all of which stirred up lively discussions and a great debate in all regions of
Canada. The questions of national unity, the
Canadian identity and the very survival of
Canada became great political issues which
were fought out by all parties in the general
as well as provincial elections in the 1960s. It
thus became apparent to Canadian leaders
and to the people that the Constitution must
be not only examined and revised but also
redrafted. There are increasing demands for a
new Constitution made in Canada by Canadians for Canadians.
There are several courses of action that can
be taken to adopt a new Constitution, if that
is what Canadians want. The method that has
been recently applied and is still in progress
is the holding of federal-provincial conferences. It has been a useful method to initiate
the process of constitutional revision, which
bas had the support of all political parties.
These conferences have been instrumental in
helping to clarify the great issues regarding
constitutional matters.
In his introduction of the motion to appoint
the joint committee, the Government Leader
in the Senate, the Honourable Paul Martin,

SENATE DEBATES
our distinguished colleague with an enviable
record of public service, who participated in
all these conferences, outlined these issues:
Official languages, fundamental rights,
distribution of powers, reform of institutions linked with federalism, among
which the Senate and the Supreme Court
of Canada, regional disparities, amending
procedure and provisional arrangements,
and finally the mechanisms of federalprovincial relations.
There was agreement that "the national capital should symbolize the two main cultural
groups of Canada". Emanating from these
conferences were also:
The proposal as to whether or not there
should be entrenched in the Constitution
a bill of rights covering civil liberties;
whether or not there should be a redistribution of powers in the British North
America Act, a reallocation of the funetions under sections 91 and 92, taking into
consideration some of the problems of the
urban community; whether or not
changes have to be made in the Constitution to enable the federal Government to
deal more directly with matters that now
come under the exclusive authority of the
provinces or the municipalities.
Although it had not been a subject of discussion at these conferences, Senator Martin also
raised the important question of the repatriation of the Constitution. There is the question
of the place and role of the monarchy. And,
of course, there are others.
It is apparent that these federal-provincial
conferences on the Constitution have reached
their limit. They have already bogged down
in stalemate without achieving a consensus of
opinion on important matters in the last
public sessions and have resorted to in-camera meetings, which are highly questionable
and cannot satisfy the democratic citizens of
our country. Furthermore, it is very questionable whether eleven prime ministers and
premiers should be making these vital decisions alone, for the problem was posed as to
who really spoke on behalf of the Canadian
people-the Prime Minister of Canada or the
first ministers of the provinces.
What other methods could be employed to
adopt a new Constitution? One could be the
referendum. The Government could present
to the Canadian citizens a draft Constitution
for their approval or rejection. This could
probably be done but with great difficulty.
Canada is a vast country with communication
[Hon. Mr. Yuzyk.]

February 17, 1970

problems which must be handled in two languages. And the task of explaining to the
common people complicated clauses of legal
significance which lawyers and law professors
could argue about would be a colossal undertaking, almost insurmountable. Hence the
referendum on the Constitution seems not to
be practical.
Canadians could try the method of the constituent assembly or the constitutional convention as has been carried out in France, the
United States and other countries. The Government or a special committee could present
a draft of the new Constitution to such an
assembly composed of especially elected
representatives of the people, and members of
the federal Parliament and the provincial
legislatures. This appears to be an elaborate
process with which we have had no experience in Canada, but it could be taken into
consideration.
Because of historical circumstances and our
adherence to the evolutionary principle and
British parliamentary tradition, Canada will
in all probability seek constitutional revision
by submitting a joint petition or address of
the Senate and the House of Commons, the
Canadian Parliament, to the British Parliament, which from ýall indications will probably give its approval in order to dispose of the embarrassing relationship and
predicament. This is probably the only way to
solve the problem of the repatriation of the
Constitution and may have to be applied to
the adoption of a new Constitution.
The present proposed method of a joint
parliamentary committee on the Constitution
bas come to us because this is the next best
alternative to the federal-provincial conferences, which could not make any further progress. Under the present circumstances I
think that this is the best method. Since this
committee will be authorized to go to the
public to examine carefully various submitted
proposals on the Constitution and will finally
present its recommendations to Parliament in
an unbiased, objective manner, it will engage
both parliamentarians and the people, young
and old, throughout Canada in a great national debate in conference halls, in educational
institutions, in organizations, in the press,
radio and television, in the legislatures and in
Parliament. This will be participatory democracy and a massive effort to help create a just
society. I believe that Canadian citizens will
welcome this involvement in the making of a
new Constitution and a new Canada in a new
age.

February 17, 1970

SENATE DEBATES

A viable Canadian Constitution must reflect
the paramount interests of the Canadian
people. Our population is heterogeneous. In
the process of constitutional review it will be
necessary to take into consideration the
Canadian identity, the image of Canada.
Over 100 years ago, the Fathers of Confederation thought mainly in terms of EnglishFrench relations, although there was the
Indian problem. Today our national, provincial and local leaders must think in much
broader terms.
During the past century a new element and
a new force has been gradually emerging and
increasingly making an impact upon Canadian society. It has been a consistent policy of
Canadian Governments since Confederation
in 1867 to encourage and even to subsidize
immigration and settlement in order to develop our vast and rich natural resources as
well as the economy. As a result, many peoples from many lands, but preponderantly
from Europe, have come to this country and
acquired citizenship. For several generations
this non-British, non-French element has
been steadfly increasing in numbers and in
proportion. These "other" or so-called "new"
Canadians in reference to the British and
French elements are sometimes termed as the
third element, the third group, the third
dimension, the third force, or simply as the
ethnic groups. Whatever the name, these
Canadians are a fact of Canadian society and
life, just as the British and the French.
For the purpose of clarification, it should be
pointed out that the application of the term
"ethnic" in the Canadian press is often confusing and erratic. The Dominion Bureau of
Statistics states: "Canada's population is
made up of many cultural or ethnic groups,
the largest being the British Isles and French
groups."
The 1961
census-takers were
instructed to trace a person's ethnic group
through his father in answer to the question:
"To what ethnie or cultural group did you or
your ancestors (on the male side) belong on
coming to this continent?" In the census
tables showing the ethnic composition of the
Canadian population, the British element
includes the English, Scottish, Irish and
Welsh. Consequently, it is improper and misleading to refer to the non-British, nonFrench element solely as ethnic, when this
term in reality applies to all origins in
Canada.
The first Canadian census, conducted in
1871 in the four provinces of Ontario, Quebec,
Nova Scotia and New Brunswick, recorded
3,485,761 people. The British numbered over
21498--W4

2,100,000 (English 706,000; Irish 846,000; Scots
546,000). I do not have a figure for the Welsh.
The French numbered 1,100,000 and the
others 285,000 (about 8 per cent of the population), of whom over 200,000 were of German
extraction and the remainder included the
Dutch (29,000), Negroes (21,000), Swiss, Italians, Indians, etc.
Shortly after the entry of Manitoba into
Confederation in 1870 came the massive settlement of the west. Every year the frontier
receded as successive immigrant waves
brought in, along with the British and Americans, also increasing numbers of new ethnic
groups, anxious to till the soil and live a life
of freedom. In the 1870s came the
German-speaking
Mennonites
from
the
Ukrainian territories of Russia, and the Icelanders; in the 1880s the Jews from Russian
Ukraine and the Germans from Germany;
and in the early 1890s the Ukrainians and
Poles from Austria-Hungary. The large-scale
Government-directed and partially subsidized
settlement of the prairies initiated in 1896 by
Sir Clifford Sifton of Manitoba, Minister of
the Interior in the Government of Sir Wilfrid
Laurier, brought into Canada an increasing
influx of settlers of many other origins, such
as Hungarians, Dutch, Norwegians, Swedes,
Russian
Doukhobors,
Czechs,
Slovaks,
Rumanians, Finns, Serbs, Croatians, Italians,
Japanese and many others. The rapid
increase of the population in the Northwest
Territories justified the establishment in 1905
of two new provinces-Saskatchewan and
Alberta.
The First World War cut off the widening
stream of immigration in 1914. The flow of
settlers was again resumed in the 1920s, but
came to a halt in 1930 when the Great
Depression had set in. After the Second
World War the Government again opened the
doors of immigration, which brought in more
people from Germany, Italy, the Netherlands,
Denmark, Portugal and the Scandinavian and
Balkan countries. The Iron Curtain prevented
the flow of immigrants from the Slavic, Baltic
and East European countries, except those
who had come from the displaced persons'
camps immediately after the war.
With this great influx of many peoples
from many lands the face of the Canadian
population has undergone a tremendous
change when compared with a hundred years
ago.
Honourable senators, I have had a graph

Hon. Mr. Martin: With great respect, Mr.
Speaker, I do not think Senator Hollett
objected to the inclusion of those figures as
part of the appendix. He simply affirmed,
with characteristic vigour, that he did not
agree with the figures. That is quite a different matter.
The Hon. the Speaker: If honourable Senator Hollett agrees with the Leader of the
Government, then there is no problem. I
should like to hear from Senator Hollett now.
Hon. Mr. Holleit: Well, there is a problem
as far as I am concerned. When a member
introduces in this Senate figures which are
misleading and give rise to a misinterpretation of the make-up of our population, then I
object very much to their being put into the
record. Why divide the British into English,
Irish and Scottish? Why not divide the
French into Normans and all the rest?
Hon. Mr. Bourget: Oh, no.
Hon. Mr. Holleil: Why not? And then there
are "others"-729,000 of them. Who are the
others? Who are they? I suppose they are
entitled to have their ethnie origins in here.
I object very much to this being put in, but
of course you will override me and put them
in. If that is your wish, then put them in.
Hon. Mr. McDonald: Agreed.
Hon. Senalors: Agreed.
Hon. Mr. Bourget: On division.
(For text of chart, table and map see Appendix, pp. 568-70.)
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable Senator
Yuzyk.
Hon. Mr. Yuzyk: I shall now continue.
Even a casual examination of the statistics
and the accompanying graph will reveal significant trends in our population. The British
element during the past 60 years has steadily
decreased, not in numbers but in proportion,
from 57 per cent to 44 per cent.
Hon. Mr. Holleti: May I ask a question?
Who are the British?
Hon. Mr. Yuzyk: I am taking this from the
statistics of the Dominion Bureau of
Statisties.
Hon. Mr. Holleti: Of ten years ago.
Hon. Mr. Yuzyk: Of 1961, right. That was
the last census.
Hon. Mr. Holleit: Why not 1971?
[Hon. Mr. Flynn.]

February 17, 1970

Hon. Mr. Yuzyk: There will be a census
this year and we will have the results of that
next year. I can only rely on the figures that
have been published by the Dominion Bureau
of Statistics for the last census.
At any rate, the British element has
decreased, as I said, from 57 per cent to 44
per cent. The French element has constantly
held its own proportion, about 30 per cent.
The ethnie groups of the third element, on
the other hand, have steadily increased from
12 to over 26 per cent, numbering nearly 5
million people, more than doubling their element, which is quickly approaching the numerical proportional position of the French
Canadians. If the trends of the past six
decades continue, by 1981 the Canadian population will be roughly one-third British, onethird French and one-third all other ethnic
groups. The rapidly increasing numbers of
the third element ethnie groups are indicative
of the emerging new factor in Canadian life.
For a cross-section of the Canadian population today one would have to look at the table
labelled "Ethnic Composition". Here it will be
noted that the French are the largest e:hnic
group in Canada, forming 30.4 per cent of the
population, and considerably ahead of the
English, who constitute 23 per cent, the Scottish 10.4 per cent and the Irish 9.6 per cent.
The larger ethnie groups of the third element,
with the exception of the Italians who have
been arriving in large numbers only recently,
are preponderantly Canadian-born, many
through three or four generations. These settiers rapidly acquired Canadian citizenship
and hence are Canadians in the full sense.
They resent being referred to as "New
Canadians" for they regard themselves fully
and equally Canadian in the same way as do
the British and French.
A look at the present ethnie composition of
the ten provinces of Canada according to the
three elements will reveal some interesting
facts. The British element predominates in
Newfoundland-Senator Hollett's province.
Hon. Mr. Hollet: English, Irish and Scots.
Hon. Mr. Yuzyk: And What about the
Welsh?
Hon. Mr. Holleti: And the Welsh.
Hon. Mr. Yuzyk: Then there is Prince
Edward Island, 80 per cent; Nova Scotia, 71
per cent; and New Brunswick, 55 per cent.
The French element predominates only in
Quebec with 81 per cent while the largest

February 17, 1970

SENATE DEBATES

French minority, 40 per cent, is in New Brunswick. The third element, 53 per cent, predominates in Saskatchewan, exceeding the
British, 40 per cent, followed by the French, 7
per cent; in Alberta, 49 per cent, followed
by the British, 45 per cent and the French, 6
per cent; in Manitoba the third element
is 48 per cent, followed by the British, 43 per
cent, and the French 9 per cent. It forms a
considerable proportion in British Columbia,
35 per cent; in Ontario 39 per cent, and in
Nova Scotia 17 per cent. In general, the third
element,
composed
overwhelmingly
of
Canadian-born, forms about 50 per cent of
the population of the three prairie provinces,
where obviously their impact is the greatest.
An example of the many-sided contributions to Canada of one of the new ethnic
groups is the half million Ukrainian Canadians who in 1966 celebrated the seventy-fifth
anniversary of their settlement in Canada.
Their outstanding contribution is in agriculture. In seven decades they have brought
under cultivation approximately ten million
acres of land on the prairies. By comparison
this is twice as much as the French Canadians, who in over three centuries in Quebec
cultivated some five million acres. Of course
the terrain was different but I just wanted to
compare them.
Ukrainian Canadians have been frequent
winners of world and Canadian championships of wheat, oats and vegetables. Some of
the best varieties of wheat are of Ukrainian
origin. Over 130 Ukrainian place-names testify to their bringing of civilization to vast
areas which were previously wilderness. Railroad construction, large building and housing
construction, mining, various kinds of manufacturing, etc., have benefited from the
labour, inventiveness and management of
Ukrainians. They are found in large numbers
in the teaching profession, law, medicine and
engineering, including the universities. Their
cultural contribution is generally recognized
through folk-dancing in colourful costumes,
choirs, music, embroidery, handicraft and
woodwork, as well as by the fact that the
Ukrainian language and literature is taught at
several of the leading Canadian universities
and as an elective subject in the secondary
schools of Saskatchewan, Manitoba and
Alberta. Ukrainian has now been introduced
in the public schools in these provinces.
If participation in public affairs is an essential criterion of the genuine integration of any
group into Canadian life, the Ukrainians certainly display evidence of full integration.
They have produced several hundreds of

reeves of municipalities, many aldermen of
towns and cities and several mayors of large
cities such as Winnipeg, Edmonton and Windsor, many magistrates, judges and hundreds of
civil servants. It will interest you to hear in
this chamber that the Ukrainian community
has provided 69 members of provincial legislatures including 7 cabinet ministers in Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Alberta and Ontario, 19
federal Members of Parliament, including the
Honourable Michael Starr, Minister of
Labour from 1957 to 1963, and 3 senators, for
a total of 91 parliamentarians. On February
2, this year, Dr. Stephen Worobetz was sworn
in as the Lieutenant Governor of Saskatchewan, the first of Ukrainian origin to attain
this high office.
About 10,000 Ukrainians served in the
Canadian military forces during World War
I, and about 40,000 during World War II,
many as officers and many of whom paid the
supreme sacrifice for this country. All these
and other achievements, which I have elaborated in my recent book on the Ukrainian
Canadians, are proof that they are builders of
Canada and qualifying partners with the
British and the French.
Other ethnic groups have made similar and
various other contributions. The Canadian
Citizenship Branch of the Department of the
Secretary of State has done a very useful
service to Canada by publishing The Canadian Family Tree, a handbook of information
on all active ethnic groups, some 50 in
number, focussing attention on their distinctive contributions. The Jews, Poles, Slovaks,
Ukrainians, Lithuanians and others have published full-volume studies of their groups.
This should be done by all ethnic groups and
the information from such studies should be
incorporated in the general histories of
Canada. The recognition of the contributions
of our ethnic groups in Canadian histories
and history texts in schools and universities
will help to increase understanding, break
down the barriers of prejudice and promote
appreciation and co-operation in the building
of a better life and society in our country.
What is common to the ethnic groups of the
third element is their intense loyalty to
Canada, their belief in a strong and united
Canadian nation based on a mutual partnership of all its component elements, their
whole-hearted acceptance of the Canadian
democratic institutions and way of life, and
their desire to perpetuate their cultures as an
integral part of the evolving cultural pattern
of Canada. In general, they recognize the fact

SENATE DEBATES
that the founders of the Canadian Confederation were the British and the French and
therefore English and French should be the
official languages. That should be the only
privilege that the British and the French are
entitled to, otherwise all ethnic groups and all
individuals should have equal rights in every
respect; there must not be second-class citizenship, which can only spell trouble. Some
regard the new element as a sort of cernent
that can serve to bind the two founding
peoples.
There are many sceptics, not only in the
British and French groups but also in the
other ethnic groups, who believe that a united
voice and action of the third element is
impossible and even undesirable. Such people
do not take into consideration that the organizations and spokesmen of the ethnic groups
were given the opportunity to express their
views to the Royal Commission on Bilingualisrn and Bieulturalism in its hearings across
the country. From the many reports that I
have read I have come to the conclusion that
there was fairly unanimous opinion that
Canada should be bilingual in some form,
that our country is not bicultural but in reality multicultural, that official recognition
should be given to multiculturalism by permitting non-official languages and cultural
subjects to be taught in the public and
secondary schools and in the universities,
wherever there were sufficient numbers to
maintain such classes, that the Canadian
Broadcasting Corporation should sponsor
regular programs on the national radio and
television networks, presenting the contributions of our ethnie groups whieh would
promote better understanding of our cultural
heritage, that ethnic groups should receive
more representation in government bodies
and national institutions and that they should
not be discriminated against in federal, provincial and municipal governments and civil
services.
In general, the ethnic groups have been
practising co-operation since the annual meetings of the Canada Ethnic Press Federation in
1940, since when common policy has gradually evolved. In its presentation to the Senate
Mass Media Committee last week, the Federation claimed a circulation between 750,000
and one million for the ethnic press, with a
readership approaching three million. Further
progress in the direction of the crystallization
of common objectives was achieved in 1965
when the first national conference on Canadian Slavs was held in Banff, Alberta, attended
[Hon. Mr. Yuzyk.]

February 17, 1970

by representatives of several Slavie groups
which number over 1.1 million. Senator Cameron was a host at this conference.
Over 100 delegates heard 18 inter-disciplinary papers, which were later published in a
separate volume. The conference established a
permanent inter-university committee on
Canadian Slavs which convened the second
conference in June 1967 at the University of
Ottawa during the Centennial celebrations.
Over 200 representatives heard 74 papers on
a variety of topics pertaining to Canadian
Slavs and their role in Canada. These papers
are to be published in the near future. This
conference was a tremendous success and of
historical significance. Harmony and co-operation was achieved, of course in the best
interests of Canada. If we recall the history of
the Slavs in Europe, we should note that in
over 1,000 years of relations the Slavs had
never succeeded in achieving harmony such
as was evident in Canada. They have given
full co-operation in the excellent work of the
Canadian Folk Arts Council and the Canadian
Citizenship Councils. Consequently, I believe
that the magie of our great country can overcome ethnie prejudices and distrust, and
achieve the unity of our diverse elements in
building an ever greater and better Canada.
Present-day Canada is a pluralistie society,
a country of numerous minorities with two
dominant cultures. During the past 100 years
she has been gradually evolving into a multicultural nation. The concept of a "bilingual,
multicultural Canadian nation" is realistie
and the very essence of a dynamie Canadianism. It is fortunate that Canadian governments have rejected the "melting pot" theory,
with its colourless uniformity, and have promoted a "mosaie type" of Canadian culture,
based on the voluntary integration of the best
elements of the cultures of the component
ethnie groups. The development of a composite Canadian culture, rich in variety, beauty
and harmony, reflects the principle of "unity
in continuing diversity" and the democratic
spirit of compromise inherent in the Canadian
Confederation. This was manifestly evident in
the Centennial celebrations.
A great Canadian leader, who could foresee
the shape of things to come, had the vision of
a multicultural Canadian nation. Prime Minister Sir Wilfrid Laurier, a great architect of
Canada, under whose administration the west
was peopled by the various ethnic groups,
some 70 years ago, left the following message

February 17. 1970

SENATE DEBATES

to future generations-and I think this should
even be memorized by all Canadians:
I have visited in England one of those
models of Gothic architecture which the
hand of genius, guided by an unerring
faith, has moulded into a harmonious
whole. This cathedral is made of marble,
oak and granite. It is the image of the
nation I would like to see Canada
become. For here I want the marble to
remain the marble; the granite to remain
the granite; the oak to remain the oak;
and out of all these elements I would
build a nation great among the nations of
the world.
A bilingual and multicultural Canadian
nation, dedicated to the high principles of
freedom and democracy, justice and truth,
and equality and brotherhood, is not a Utopia,
but is gradually becoming a reality. This is
the all-inclusive Canadian identity, which is
the broad basis for the development of a new
Canada.
Al Canadians are involved in the process
of change. Life is becoming more and more
complex, to which our citizens of necessity
must adapt themselves. The only safeguard of
individual and group rights is a sound and
vigilant public opinion which can be implemented by conscientious leaders inspired by
the highest ideals of democracy. Our leaders
and citizens must be conscious of one important fact, that majorities, because of their
dominant position in our society, usually do
not feel the need for constitutional reform.
The corollary is also true, that minorities,
without status, without power and without
effective voice, feel that their rights should be
protected in the Constitution.
An excellent essay on human rights, pubiished in "The Royal Bank of Canada Monthly Letter" of January 1968, refers to the
rights of minorities in the following manner:
What is needed in applying the rules of
human rights is that in addition to the
principle of majority rule there should be
recognition by every group in society of
the legitimacy of minority group interest,
provided as Sidney Hook wrote in The
Hero in History: "The group in question
accepts the methods of free inquiry and
democratic decision as principles of negotiating conflicts of interest".
Majorities should be generous and gracious. They can spoil their goodness if,
while admitting that it takes all sorts of
people to make a world, they say it as
though they find it a regrettable thing.

On the other hand, minorities should
beware lest insistence upon rights should
become a hammer by which affection is
beaten to death.
The fundamental cause of group and
class conflict is the attitude of superiority
on the part of one group or class toward
another. It is essential that minorities be
encouraged to take part in the common
life of the community, whatever customs
and cultures they wish to preserve among
themselves, and that they be welcomed
warmly by the majority.
The Canadian ethnic groups of non-British,
non-French origin are greatly concerned
about many developments and recent Government statements and actions. They are rarely,
if at all, consulted. Yet they feel that they are
an integral part of society and should be consulted in matters in which their fate is
involved. They want to see justice done in the
proposed «just society" in which they do not
want to be second-class citizens.
There is no doubt that in Canada we are
now going through a crisis not only in English-French relations but in relations with
other ethnic groups. We are witnessing a
more militant attitude on the part of our
Indians, who resent the paternalism of the
establishment and desire control over their
own affairs and a better deal as citizens. Various Canadian ethnic groups want a better
share in all aspects of Canadian life, together
with the responsibilities, and want to be
regarded as partners in the building of a new
and better Canada. Students and the youth
are protesting against the Establishment and
its association with the mechanization and
automation of society which is becoming
increasingly de-humanized; they want to be
human beings and have a voice in the affairs
that affect them directly.
In my speech to the Senate on October 1,
1968, I drew attention to the concern of the
Canadian ethnic groups of the third element
about constitutional changes proposed at the
federal-provincial
conferences, in which
matters the Government made no attempt to
consult them. Subsequently, on July 8, 1969,
in the Senate debate on the Official Languages bill, to which I gave approval, I
introduced an amendment to clause 38 to give
status to the "non-official" languages used
extensively in Canada. As honourable senators will recall, the amendment was rejected
in the Standing Senate Committee on Legal
and Constitutional Affairs and later in the
Senate. The Government was not willing to

SENATE DEBATES
go further as it was waiting for the forthcoming report of the Royal Commission on Bilingualism and Biculturalism on the ethnie
groups, which was supposed to have made its
appearance in 1967 but which still has not
been released. Senator Roebuck, the Chairman of the Legal and Constitutional Affairs
Committee, made the following significant
statement, which should be noted by all who
are concerned:
I would suggest to those people who
speak languages other than one or both
of the two "official languages" that it
should be thoroughly understood that
certain services are being extended to the
French minority in English-speaking portions of Canada, and to the English
minority in French-speaking districts,
and that in consequence our friends who
speak
languages other than those
described as official will have a very good
case indeed for equal assistance from the
Government officials.
If in the future one, say of the Ukrainian population, should come to a Government Department with the request: "You
are ex'ending privileges to the French
population, and we have at least as many
Ukrainians in the locality as there are
French," I can scarcely understand any
government saying "no" to such a request
for equal services. That applies not only
to Ukrainians, Poles, Italians, but to
many others.

February 17, 1970

The full report of the proceedings of this
conference has been published and sent to
government and public leaders, and to public
and university libraries. This was published
with the aid of the Secretary of State.
Of the six resolutions which were unanimously adopted, I want to draw attention to
the following:
The conference supports the efforts of
the federal and provincial governments
in formulating a viable Canadian Constitution and the conference unequivocally
rejects the concept of biculturalism and
seeks official recognition of the multicultural character of Canada.
I would like to explain that multiculturalism
includes biculturalism, a term which by itself
tends to discriminate against all those of nonBritish and non-French ancestry.
This Thinkers' Conference established the
Canadian Cultural Rights Committee, electing
me as its chairman. I am happy that there has
been a positive response from many government leaders. Prime Minister Trudeau's letter
of February 4 , 1969, stated:
I am directing that these reports should
be studied so that the views there presented may be appropriately taken into
account both in the area of constitutional
review and of cultural development.
It is also encouraging that the Government
is beginning to respond to the needs of our
pluralistie society. This can be gathered from
the speech of the Honourable Robert Stanbury, Minister without Portfolio, responsible
for Citizenship who at a banquet in Montreal
on February 7 of this year stated:
This commitment to Canada can only
corne about if every individual and every
ethnie community are afforded the opportunity to live up to their potential. Our
common objective and our shared ambition is to create a true mosaic in which
each element will stand out while at the
same time forming part of a harmonious
whole... How can we make sure that the
official status of languages is not taken to
imply special status for any particular
groups in our multicultural society?

In this debate I gave a report of the Thinkers' Conference on Cultural Rights which was
held in Toronto in December 1968, the first of
its kind in the history of Canada to bring
together delegates of the various ethnic and
cultural groups, including the Indians and
Eskimos, from various parts of Canada on a
voluntary basis. It had the support of a
Senate commi tee of patrons and five national
and government institutions and some financial assistance from the Secretary of State.
Outstanding authorities and experts spoke on
four general themes. One of the speakers was
Senator Thompson. The four general themes
were:
(1) Rights and responsibilities of cultural
groups in Canadian life;
This is one of the grave problems in our
(2) Preservation of cultural traditions in society. The establishment of an advisory
Canada;
council representative of the ethnic groups
(3) Striking a balance in the Canadian cul- which would co-operate with the Government

in cultural affairs would greatly assist in
(4) Public policy and the preservation of helping to overcome discrimination. The

whole question of discrimination will have to
[Hon. Mr. Yuzyk.]

February 17, 1970

SENATE I EBATES

be studied by the parliamentary constitutional committee. We know that many groups of
citizens are clamouring for rights, but the
committee should also find a place in the
Constitution for corresponding duties and
responsibilities.
If this committee is to have the confidence
of the Canadian public, it will have to be
fairly representative of important segments of
our population, of the regions and the political movements. The bulk of the members
should be known for their broad interests and
for their sense of fair play and justice. I hope
that when the committee is chosen from both
bouses its membership will reflect the dynamic elements in our country.
When the committee goes into action I
think that it should always keep in mind that
Canadians are a large family with a variety
of interests that at times lead to conflicts. If
there is a spirit of goodwill, the differences
and conflicts can be settled. The emphasis
must be placed on what unites us and there
must be an understanding of those who hold
different views. Members of the committee
will achieve the best results if they approach
the problems of the Constitution with an open
mind, and in the spirit of justice and toleration seek a consensus through reconciliation
and compromise, which have been so fundamental in the development and progress of
our country.
Hon. Paul Martin: Honourable senatorsThe Hon. the Speaker: I must inform
honourable senators that if the honourable
Government Leader speaks now his speech
will have the effect of closing the debate.
Hon. Mr. Holleit: Honourable senators,
I should like to direct a question to Senator
Yuzyk. He spoke of discrimination in Canada,
and I wonder if he can indicate to us some
cases where discrimination has been proven
against Canadians.
Hon. Mr. Yuzyk: Honourable senators, I do
not think I would care to deal with the whole
problem of discrimination at this time. I
would be quite happy at some future date to
speak on this whole topic. This requires much
thought and explanation. I would prefer, in
discussing the matter of discrimination, to
prepare my arguments, whether they be for
or against. I stated that we should guard
against discrimination.
Hon. Mr. Holleti: Is there such a thing as
discrimination in Canada?

563

Hon. Mr. Yuzyk: Yes, I would say that
there is discrimination.
Hon. Mr. Holleit: Can you prove that?
Hon. Mr. Yuzyk: I myself have been discriminated against very much throughout my
life.
Mr. Holleit: You are an individual.
Hon. Mr. Yuzyk: I think I can make out a
case for groups too.
Hon. Mr. Martin: Honourable senators, we
have heard a number of speeches on the
proposal that there be a joint committee of
the Senate and the House of Commons to
consider a revision of the Constitution of
our country. As Senator Yuzyk bas just pointed out, within the last two years there have
been three conferences of the federal and
provincial governments on constitutional revision. It is important to recall the circumstances in which these constitutional discussions of recent date began.
They began primarily with a request
addressed to the federal Government by a
number of provinces of Canada, a request
that was high-lighted at a conference called
by the head of the Government of Ontario,
the Conference for Tomorrow, where over the
television and other news media there was a
full and frank exchange of the divisions in
the country, and of the concerns that exist
because of the position taken by some sections of the nation. It was in pursuit of that
request that the federal Government under
Mr. Pearson called the provinces together a
short time thereafter in the first constitutional
conference in this series.
Senator Yuzyk said that these conferences
had not been a great success. The fact is, as I
said at the outset when I introduced this
motion, that it would be wrong to argue that
the conferences have not had a measure of
achievement. There was a wide measure of
tentative agreement reached in principle, if
not in every detail, on the subject of spending
power. There is no more complicated area of
dispute in the Constitution than this. Agreement has also been reached on the principle of
access to, rather than allocation of taxing
powers. This represents an important consensus. A firm position in principle was reached
on language rights. Agreement was reached in
principle that the national capital should reflect the two predominant cultural groups in
the country. Therefore, when we come to
assess the work to date it should not be
assumed that progress bas not been achieved.

SENATE DEBATES
Senator Yuzyk said that the proposal for a
joint committee was an arrangement that he
would support. He thought it was a better
instrument than a royal commission. We did
have a royal commission which made a report
in this very chamber at a federal-provincial
conference bearing the names of two great
Canadians, Sirois and Rowell. We have the
benefit of the conclusions of that royal commission and these undoubtedly are conclusions which will be considered by the joint
committee as they have played a part in the
briefs presented by the various governments
to one another.
This is not the first time that there has
been a committee of Parliament. The committee under the chairmanship of Mr. Lapointe
over 40 years ago served its purpose, even
though it did not yield great results. It would
be wrong to say, however, that because this
committee is being set up we should conclude
that the conferences of the two levels of government will not continue, or that they are
not likely to succeed. The Government does
not agree with that position but believes that
the discussions between the two levels of government will be productive.
It took many months and a great deal of discussion to bring about the kind of agreement
that made possible the passage of the British
North America Act in the Parliament at
Westminster. Long before those agreements
were reached by the fathers of this country,
there were frustrations and interminable discussions, but there was final agreement. I
have no doubt that we will reach agreement
in our constitutional discussions, difficult as
they are, both in this committee and in the
forum of those who have the executive
authority given to them by the people to take
the initiating act.
Of course Senator Yuzyk is right that it is
not governments that are going to finalize the
Constitution. The Constitution can only be
finalized ad referendum. After the executives
of the two levels of government, provincial
and federal, have reached their positions,
then it must be the Parliament of Canada and
ultimately the people of Canada who give
their approval and imprimatur. In the meantime there has to be a dialogue and debate
which involves some of the most complicated
issues. All one has to do is look at the problems that face governments in Canada today,
the urban problem, that of environment and
pollution, the responsibility for unemployment, the kind of social legislation that we
must develop and the kind of fiscal and
[Hon. Mr. Martin.]

February 17, 1970

monetary policy that must be pursued by
governments at a time of excessive prices.
These are problems which for their orderly
solution depend on the Constitution in the
final analysis. These were problems not
envisaged by the Fathers of Confederation, so
I suppose it is not unnatural that the provinces should have asked the federal Government to call together a conference for the
purpose of ironing out constitutional difficulties and bringing into being either a partially
or totally revised constitution.
It does not mean that the Government of
Canada and those of the provinces cannot go
on until such time as agreement in these
areas bas been reached. This country, with its
problems, will carry on. These problems will
be dealt with by the various governments
within the context of the present Constitution
until agreement is reached.
I believe that the proposal to place this
matter not only in the hands of the executive
but in the hands of the members of Parliament of the two houses is at this time a good
decision. I am glad that honourable senators
have all expressed their concurrence in this
view. There were in the course of the debate
many things said, some relevant to the issue
before us and some not having a bearing on
the immediate proposition. It is for that
reason that tonight I do not propose to deal at
any length with what Senator Argue had to
say about conditions in western Canada.
However, I do not want him or any other
senator from western Canada to conclude that
the Government is not concerned about the
problems of that region. The problems that
arise out of the surplus of wheat understandably agitate the western farmer, but they also
concern the rest of the people of Canada, who
are greatly concerned about the economic
consequences.
I do not agree with Senator Argue
that the Government is doing nothing to meet
that problem. At the appropriate moment I
will be happy to indicate what the Government has done, even though this may not
result in a final and satisfactory solution of
the very difficult problem of wheat surplus. I
do not agree either that the problem of western alienation, so-called, can be looked upon
as a movement to break away from this country. My own view is that the separatist movement in any part of Canada will not succeed,
because the majority of the people in all sections of Canada recognize that in our unity
lies our strength. I am sure that Senator

February 17, 1970

SENATE DEBATES

Argue would be the first to agree with this in
so far as it applies to that section of Canada
from which he comes.
Others took the position that the debate
afforded us an opportunity to examine some
of the procedures upon which the Senate is
now embarked.

Senator

O'Leary, in a characteristically

effective speech, said he thought the Senate's
role of investigation is one that ought to be
examined with care. I think anything Senator
O'Leary suggests ought to be exanined seriously, but I share the view expressed by
Senator Cameron that the role of inquiry the
Senate is assuming is a useful and a valuable
role.
In passing, I want to say that I was rather
impressed with the approval given the Special Committee of the Senate on Science
Policy the other day by a United States Congressman, Charles A. Mosher, who was visiting in Ottawa. He referred to that committee
of the Senate as "the most thorough study of
any in the world."
I am also satisfied that the work of the
Special Senate Committee on Poverty under
Senator Croll, and the work of the Special
Senate Committee on the Mass Media under
the chairmanship of Senator Davey, is not
a dangerous role for the Senate but a
satisfactory role that it can perform, at a time
when in the other place the opportunity in
this very area is limited compared to what it
was before the Government had to pre-empt
to the extent that it does the time of that
place in the presentation and implementation
of its legislative program.
This proposed comrnittee will have 30
members, 20 from the other place and 10
from this house, seven from this side of the
house and three from the other side. It was
rightly said that a committee of this sort
might be more representative than its membership indicates. I can assure honourable
senators that the greatest care was taken by
those who assist me in these matters in the
selection of the personnel from this side, and
I am sure the same is true of the Leader of
the Opposition and those associated with him
who have to make these decisions. We on this
side had seven members to pick. They were
picked on a functional basis. It has been
agreed that are all senators of capacity. They
will discharge their function with distinction;
they will discharge their function as we in
this chamber expect thern to discharge the
heavy responsibility entrusted to them.

It may be that as time goes on there might
be one or two who feel they cannot serve on
the committee, for one reason or another, and
in that event we shall certainly want to take
into consideration the suggestions that have
been made.
The field of examination by this committee
is unlimited. Thus far the governments have
been considering the entrenchment of a Bill
of Rights, expanding the present Bill of
Rights, moving it out of the exclusive federal
sphere, taking into account federal jurisdiction, to give the existing Bill of Rights a
greater authority and coverage. There has
been discussion of the entrenchment of the
important rights guaranteed under section 133
of the British North America Act. Agreement
has not yet been reached on this proposal, but
there has been a wide discussion. The jurisdiction of the federal Government in this area
bas been questioned. In any event, this is one
of the matters that will be discussed by the
governments as well as by the committee.
There will be the question of economic disparity. Many people in this country today
argue that more important than the constitutional question is the question of economie
disparity. The committee will examine this.
This is the contention now of some of the
provinces, as we know from the reported discussion of the conference of yesterday and
today. The Government does not for one
moment deny the great importance of economic disparity, and as an earnest of its
interest and concern has established a separate department of government dedicated to
that assignment.
There will be the question of working out
the formula for the allocation of the spending
power. The federal Government's capacity for
taxation, representing the nation as a whole,
is of course unlimited. To what extent can
access be given to the provinces to meet their
heavy obligations? These are difficult and
vital questions that will be hammered out,
but they will be discussed and I believe that
solutions will be reached. They will not be
reached tomorrow; they will not be reached
next year; but it is perhaps well that we take
our time so that we conclude correctly in a
way that will not be damaging to the national
interest.
Then there is the question of foreign policy.
Where does jurisdiction for foreign policy lie?
Can it be shared with the provincial governments? Can there be more than one authority
speaking for the nation in respect of our relations with other countries? If it is agreed that

SENATE DEBATES
the treaty-making power lies exclusively with
the federal power, to what extent can agreements by the provinces be entered into with
respect to matters under section 92 of the
British North America Act? Does it require, as
the federal Government contends, an umbrella agreement, an agreement to which these
secondary conventions, these ententes, must
be made subject? These are the matters, and
many more, that will be considered by this
joint committee.
I am sorry that in the other place one
member of that house, while approving the
establishment of this joint committee, said,
however, he did not want to see a joint committee established; he did not wish in this
endeavour, much as he had high regard for
the membership of this House of Parliament,
to sit with senators. I regret that statement.
Each Member of Parliament is responsible in
both houses for what is said by him in that
house, but it is inconceivable to me that we
could have a parliamentary committee that
did not embrace both houses, particularly
when we are dealing with as fundamental a
matter as the Constitution.
Senator Yuzyk made one emphatic point. If
I do not cover all the matters he referred to I
do want to mention what I believe was his
underlying thesis. He pointed out, using the
figures of 1961 from the Dominion Bureau of
Statistics, the character of the Canadian
population.
Senator Yuzyk did not deny that under the
Constitution there were two official language
groups, nor do those who share with him his
particular background take issue. However, it
is important that we should remember the
wording of section 133 of the Constitution
which reads:
Either the English or the French Language may be used by any Person in the
Debates of the Houses of the Parliament
of Canada and of the Houses of the
Legislature of Quebec; and both those
Languages shall be used in the respective
Records and Journals of those Houses;
and either of those Languages may be
used by any Person or in any Pleading or
Process in or issuing from any Court of
Canada established under this Act, and in
or from all or any of the Courts of
Quebec.
We have subsequently, of course, by the Languages Bill added to the scope of this
provision.
I am grateful to Senator Yuzyk for frankly
acknowledging the constitutional position
[Hon. Mr. Martin.]

February 17, 1970

with regard to the two official languages. I
wish I had brought with me tonight the words
of Walter Tarnopolsky of the Osgoode Law
School, now Dean of the Law School at the
University of Windsor. At one of the conferences that I know Senator Yuzyk attended,
Dean Tarnopolsky spoke lucidly and cogently
on this point. It was clear that there was no
disagreement as to the effort by the Government and the provinces of Canada to observe
strictly the implications of section 133 of the
British North America Act.
When we refer to the two official languages,
as the Prime Minister said when be introduced this subject in the other place, there is
no thought of overlooking the existence of
other groups in our country who are referred
to by name in the table which Senator Yuzyk
placed before us tonight. In the Royal Commission on Bilingualism and Biculturalism
there was clearly an appreciation indicated in
the recommendations of that commission in
Volumes 1 and 2-I have not yet finished my
full reading of Volume 3-of the existence
and the rights which attend the third group
in this country.
Long ago Canada took a decision that we
were to be a multicultural country, one that
is legally and constitutionally bilingual and
bicultural in character, always taking into
account the existence of these other groups
that compose the Canadian nation and represented in this chamber by Senator Yuzyk,
among others. Nothing that the Government
is doing at these constitutional conferences or
which has emanated from the report of the
Royal Commission or anything that I have
heard-I have attended all of these recent
conferences-from provincial representatives
have varied in any way from the view which
I think is implicit in our national existence.
That is, while we have two official language
groups we also have a group of other citizens
who are no less in stature or in function than
those two groups that made up the two main
formations when Confederation was established.
Senator Yuzyk quoted from Laurier. He
anticipated me because I was going to make
that same quotation as a reflection of what
most Canadians believe Canada to be, a
mosaic. As Laurier said, based on his visit to
that English cathedral, this is a land that
reminded him of the marble, of the oak and
of the granite which constituted the physical
structure of the cathedral he had visited. For
here he wanted the marble to remain, the
granite to remain and the oak to remain, and

February 17. 1970

SENATE DEBATES

out of these elements to build a nation great
among the nations of the world. That is what
this Government believes and what this Parliament subscribes to, and also what the
Canadian people believe in and want to see
done.
On my left sits Senator Croll, who was
formerly mayor in my own city and was born
in Russia, as were his father and mother.
Senator Yuzyk is himself an example of the
origins of many of our people who were born
outside this country. They have come here
and they are making their contribution to
Canada. It has been a noble contribution in
the professions, universities, business and in
Parliament. No one wants in any way to
create a second-class citizenship and no one
proposes to do so.
Notwithstanding what is being done in these
discussions or what will emanate from the
recommendations of this parliamentary committee, I can think of no more important duty
for this house and for the other place than to
be engaged in a study of the constitutional
basis of our country. The Constitution of
Canada is not completely written. That portion of it which is written is essentially
embodied in the British Act of Parliament,
the British North America Act. From that

Constitution, as the Prime Minister said,
springs the authority for our laws, for the
administration of justice and for the preservation of order in our society. It affects the
most common acts of every-day lives, the price
we pay for our groceries, our heating, the
quality of the air we breathe, the water we
drink, the programs we watch on television,
the way we run our schools and our courts,
the number of jobs, the development of
industry and the adequacy of our health and
welfare services. That is why the Constitution
is important. That is why it is important, not
only for lawyers but for those who are interested in the progress of our country; that is
why we must see to it that the basis upon
which we proceed in Parliament, in the
making of the laws of this country, are orderly and well established. That is the purpose of
this joint committee. It is satisfying to note
that this Senate is prepared to share with the
other place in the performance of this vital
task.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Motion agreed to.
The Senate adjourned until tomorrow at 3
p.m.

INCOME TAX
TUITION FEE DEDUCTIONS-QUESTION

Hon. Allister Grosari: Honourable senators,
I would like to ask a question of the Leader
of the Government, of which I have given
him notice.
My question refers to a Government notice
which appears in Part I of the Canada
Gazette, No. 7, dated February 14, 1970, at
page 382. It is headed: "Subject: Tuition Fees
of Students", and its purpose is described as
being "to update the interpretations and
requirements relative to deductions in respect
of tuition fees."
I ask the honourable Leader of the Government to inform the house as to the nature and
extent of these interpretations and requirements as they affect income tax payment by
parents and others who pay tuition fees for
students.
I point out to the Leader that whatever the
intent is, it has taken 1,600 words to explain
it.

Hon. Paul Martin: The honourable Senator
Grosart gave me notice last night of his
intention to ask this question, and I shall
have to take his question today as notice.
However, I would point out that it will be
possible to get detailed information when the
bill respecting student loans is considered by
a committee of this house. However, the
honourable senator is within his rights in
asking the question now. I will see that he is

EXPROPRIATION BILL
SECOND READING-DEBATE CONTINUED

The Senate resumed from yesterday the
adjourned debate on the motion of Hon. Mr.
Urquhart for the second reading of Bill C-136,
respecting the Expropriation of Land.
Hon. Lazarus Phillips: Honourable senators,
first I should like to congratulate the honourable sponsor of this bill (Hon. Mr. Urquhart)
for his precise and analytical explanation of
its contents. I find this bill interesting because
as I remember it is the first time in the short
period that I have been here that emphasis

February 18, 1970

SENATE DEBATES

has been placed on the rights of the subject
rather than on the privileges of the executive
part of the Government.
We are all familiar with the fact, primarily
because of two world wars and the depression, that there has been a centralization of
power in the hands of the executive. Indeed,
one of the great problems we are facing in
the present experiment with parliamentary
democracy is to discover how we can correlate the extensive powers of the executive
with the necessary protection that parliamentary institutions must give to both individuals
and property. This bill, in my humble opinion, is a very interesting and worth-while
example of what is being done in the way of
providing such protection.
I may say that when Bill C-200, to which
Senator Pearson referred, was introduced in
the other place during the last session of this
Parliament there was an appreciation of the
fact that it was not an ordinary bill. I am
hopeful that it may well be a prototype for
further bills involving the protection of both
persons and property. Indeed, when Bill C-200
was introduced in the other house in the last
session, an article appeared in the Financial
Post, from which I quote:
Possibly this bill is a new trend in the
progress towards participatory democracy.

rights under the old law or, for that matter,
under the present law, the one which we hope
to repeal, I should like to draw the attention
of honourable senators to the views of the
Honourable Mr. Justice Thorson, then President of the Exchequer Court, when he rendered a judgment in 1959 in the case of Ethel
V. Grayson vs Her Majesty the Queen,
reported in Exchequer Court Reports for the
year 1959. I shail read into the record what a
learned jurist thought of the present act. Referring to section 9 of the present Expropriation Act which we hope to repeal, and sections
46 and 49 of the Exchequer Court Act, this is
what Mr. Justice Thorson had to say:
Under these provisions a man's land
can be lawfully taken from him without
his consent, and even without his knowledge or any notice to him, merely by the
deposit of record in the proper land titles
or land registry office of a duly signed
plan and description of the land. This
may be done whenever the minister of
the department charged with the construction and maintenance of the public
work for which the land is to be taken
deems it advisable to do so. On such
deposit the expropriation of the land is
complete without any further act by
anyone. Whatever right, title or interest
the former owner, or any other person,
had in or to the land is immediately

and clear of any claims to or encumbrances upon it. All that is left to the
former owner of the land, or a person
having had a claim to or an encumbrance
upon it, is a claim to compensation,
which by section 23 of the Act is made to
stand in the stead of the land. And I
might add here that the settlement of
claims to compensation is frequently
unconscionably delayed.

I therefore regard this bill as being by way
of remedial legislation, having regard to an

SENATE DEBATES
This is what one of our most learned legal
brains thought of our present Expropriation
Act.
Lawyers generally are familiar with the
fact that the law of eminent domain has a
long history behind it. It goes back to feudal
times, where there was an associated concept
of Dieu le veut-God wishes it-and from
that time forward as the secular power was
extended, instead of Dieu le veut we had le
Roi le veut. So the whole conception of eminent domain and arbitrary confiscation of the
rights of the subject or the citizen evolved
along the lines I have mentioned.
In this connection, it may be of staggering
interest to senators to learn that as a strict
matter of law, under the laws of our country,
and going back to a case in 1881, it was held
that the Crown had the power to expropriate
land for public purposes without compensation to the owner. In other words, the Crown
could expropriate without the legal obligation
of payment. Admittedly, in practice, this right
was not practised in full by the Crown. The
case in authority for the principle that there
could be an expropriation in strict law without payment is Winnipeg vs. Cauchon, 1881,
Armour 350. Taking the indictment of the
Honourable Mr. Justice Thorson and the pure
legal principle of law, as well as going back
to ancient times in respect of the right of
expropriation, without payment whatsoever,
we can see what distance we propose to
travel in terms of the application of equitable
principles for the purpose of protecting the
rights of the person and the rights of
property.
It is for these reasons-and I do not wish to
press the point unduly, honourable senatorsthat I regard this bill of more than passing
interest. I am hopeful that when future legislation is presented to Parliament in both
houses dealing with subject matters involving
personal liberty and property, that this bill
may stand as a beacon light to those who will
be doing the drafting in terms of policies
indicated to them.
I may be wrong, and if I am, please excuse
me, but I have gone through this bill preparatory to making my observations here today,
and I do not think that there is any reference
to regulation by order in council in this bill.
This is a most extraordinary and salutary
innovation, and one which should be noted in
Hansard so that in future, when we are dealing with powers asked for by ministers by
way of appropriation of the right to give
effect to the statutes by regulations, we will
[Hon. Mr. Phillips (Rigaud).]

have a precedent to prove that one can draft
a bill without the necessity of ancillary and
complementary quasi legislation through the
practice of orders in council and regulations.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Phillips (Rigaud): In order that I
may put into the record permanent indication
of what the law is in addition to the case of
Mr. Justice Thorson and in support of the
suggestion that the law is such now that the
rights of the individual are extremely limited,
I would simply cite for the record two cases
which I will not quote but which will be
available for reference by senators who are
sufficiently interested in the subject matter to
study them. The first is the case of King vs.
Beech, 1930 Ex. C.R., pp. 133-136, a judgment of Maclean J. The second is The King
vs. the City of Toronto, 1946, Ex. C.R., pp.
424-432, O'Connor J. These judgments which I
have just referred to, dealing with the history
of eminent domain, and expropriation, have
all led to experiences that lawyers have had
through the years which have been very frustrating in terms of procedure, of timing, and
of limitation as to the amount of compensation that could be given. Generally the somewhat condescending attitude taken towards
the legal profession and towards owners of
property, when attempts were made to introduce broader principles of equity, having
regard to the strictures of the statute in dealing with expropriation cases, will now be
eliminated.
I should like in particular to draw the
attention of honourable senators to two very
important clauses, which appear on pages 9
and 16 of the bill before you. Here also we
find a very interesting and comforting precedent, to which I turn now.
Under clause 9, when the notice of intention has been registered-I am referring to
the paragraph at the top of page 9, dealing
with cases where the Crown is urgently
required to take possession property which is
a subject of the proposed expropriation-the
Crown has no right to take such possession
unless a special order in council is passed for
the purpose. Then turning to page 16, after
dealing with the intention to acquire the
property, as explained by Senator Urquhart,
you find the same provision.
The right to proceed by order in council is
not a broad right that is given. The Governor
in Council must justify the order in council as
being in the public interest. I should like to
read the pertinent paragraph, because of its

February 18, 1970

F.brary19, 970SENATE
DEBATES

importance. I read from the top of page 9,
clause 8(11:
Q11) Where, at any time before a notice of
intention is registered, the Governor in
Couneil is of the opinion that the physical
possession or use by the Crown of the
land to the extent of the interest intended to be expropriated is, by reason of
special circumnstances, urgentiy required
and that to order that a public hearing be
conducted with respect thereto would
occasion a delay prejudicial to the public
interest, the Governor in Council may
direct that no order be made by the Minister under subsection (1) with respect to
the intended expropriation and, in any
such case, a statement to that effect shail
be included in the notice of intention.
In other words, the elimination of the procedure of notice of intention can oniy be justified by order in coundil under the very special circumstances to which I have just
referred, thereby ellminating arbitrary action
or unwarranted or unjustified decision by the
executive arm. of government.
We corne now to an extraordinarily interesting part of the bill, in my opinion, namely,
the right of a person to a hearing in order to
force the executive arm. of governmnent to
justify the intent to expropriate. This is an
extremely interesting
provision of the
proposed law and is very unusual. I commend
it to your careful study because here again
we are dealing with what I referred to before
as participatory democracy.
Senator Urquhart has explained this bil in
great detail. With his concurrence, 1 propose
merely to summarize the bill under a series
of simple headings and take up two or three
aspects which I have not deait with up to this
point. If 1 were asked to summarize this
proposed Act, I would say it could be dealt
with under the following headings:
(1) Notice of intention to expropriate, and
the proceedings that must be taken by the
designated hearing offloer.
(2) Possession by the Crown only by order
in council.
(3) The right of election to reject abandonment-found in clause 18 on page 16.
(4) The right of compensation, which is
dealt with in clause 24, on page 19.
(5) The question of interest, deait with in
clause 33 on page 33.

(6) The question of costs, clause 36, page 35.
I corne back to rny point No. 3, the right of
election to reject abandonient, clause 18.
Here again I think we have an eminentiy f air
provision of law where, once a minister has
moved by the initial stage of notice of intention, there is no right of abandonmient as such
in favour of the Crown. The right of election
for abandonmient or the right of insistence on
expropriation is vested in the taxpayer. I
commend this clause as having highly significant precedent values for the future.
On the question of compensation, clause 24,
the bil introduces some revoiutionary principies which are of great interest.
Honourable senators who are lawyers and
are f amiliar with the jurisprudence will agree
with me that, broadly speaking, under the old
act, and in the jurisprudence that developed
more on an equitable basis, that withîn such
equitable principles the compensation was
restricted more or less to the market value of
the thing expropriated, without much attention being paid to ancillary damages as a
resuit of the expropriation and inconveniences of any economic or other nature.
Honourable senators, clause 24 sub-clauses
i and 2 of the bill, read as follows:
(1) The rules set forth in this section
shail be applied in determining the value
of an expropriated interest.
(2) Subject to this section, the value of an
expropriated interest is the market value
thereof, that is to say, the amount that
would have been paid for the interest if,
at the time of its taking, it had been sold
in the open market by a wulling seller to
a willing buyer.
That, broadly speaking, is the present law.
I ask honourable senators to be good
enough in due course to read the further
ancillary and very important compensations
that are now to be given as a resuit of the
expropriation. In addition to market value,
there are now to be granted costs, expenses
and losses arising out of or incidentai to the
owner's disturbance, including moving to
other premises, plus the value to the owner of
any element of special economic advantage to
him. arising out of or incidentai to his occupation of the land, and further advantages and
benefits referred to in the subsection to which
I referred honourable senators.
I think in summary form under the heading
of "Compensation" 1 have indicated the revolutionary and constructive changes that are

SENATE DEBATES
being made in favour of the citizen and of his
property rights. I have referred to item No. 5
in my summary as dealing with the question
of interest. Here we have an important innovation of punitive interest rates applicable to
punitive periods, if, as a result of dilatory
tactics on the part of the executive, relief is
not granted by way of the extra compensation
to which the owner is entitled. Here also I
think we have an interesting precedent that
might well be followed in the future.
I should have introduced as another subheading before coming to the last part of my
remarks, that for the first time we are recognizing the rights of parties to property other
than the rights which we lawyers love to
refer to learnedly as proprietas nudus, the
pure ownership of the property. The nexus,
as we say in Quebec, between the expropriated property and the Crown, was handled by
the owner of the property only and not by
others who had an interest therein, such as
tenants on lease. We now have the rights of
the tenant established as a claimant and as a
person who need not function through the
owner but who on his or her own account
can, through the procedures outlined before
the hearing officers and other officers mentioned in the statute, state their case. This
again is an innovation of great value.
Lastly, honourable senators, I should like to
remind you that under the old law, as we
used to say in the days of Ripley and the
cartoons, "Believe it or not," the owner of
property was not entitled to any costs whatsoever under the act or under the sections of
the Exchequer Court Act to which I referred.
In this connection I should like to draw a
distinction between the handling of costs
under the old law and the handling of costs
as now being done under the present statute
before you for consideration.
This is the comparison: Under the present
law a person claiming compensation has no
right to claim his legal and appraisal costs
reasonably incurred in asserting his claim
before legal proceedings are commenced to
determine the compensation payable to him.
Under the proposed new law, in summary,
the present bill makes express provision for
the payment of costs at three distinct stages:
(1) the pre-expropriation stage, when objection can be taken to the expropriation itself;
(2) the negotiation stage following upon the
confirmation of an intention to expropriate;
(3) the litigation stage to which resort may be
had in the event that a negotiated settlement cannot be achieved. So there are three
[Hon. Mr. Phillips (Rigaud).]

February 18, 1970

stages and three headings for compensation,
particularly for the harassed and down-trodden lawyers who will be handling these cases
for those whose properties are being
expropriated.
Honourable senators, for these and many
other reasons that are reflected in the bill, but
with which I did not wish to take up any
more of your time because I feel it would be
redundant, it is my intention, happily, to vote
for this bill.
Hon. Mr. Choquette: I should like to ask
honourable Senator Phillips (Rigaud) to clarify one point. Suppose an amount is offered by
the Government in an expropriation case and
is deposited into court but is refused by the
litigant. Then, if when judgment is rendered
by the Exchequer Court the amount happens
to be the same or less than originally off ered,
is the litigant in the same position as in other
court cases? In other words, is he saddled
with the costs?
Hon. Mr. Phillips (Rigaud): In the absence
of a statute the question of costs is always
discretionary, or at least it used to be discretionary in the court. But I should say that, in
the light of the present legislation, where
provision is made for the payment of costs
under the three headings to which I have
referred, costs would be chargeable against
the Crown notwithstanding the fact that the
court finding might be in an amount less than
the deposit made based upon the initial
appraisal.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: Honourable senators, I
have a supplementary question for either
Senator Phillips (Rigaud) or Senator Urquhart.
When an offer of compensation has been
made which the expropriated party considers
insufficient, is the expropriated party entitled
to be paid that amount and then to continue
seeking the difference to which he considers
he is entitled?
This is an important point, because very
often the expropriated party cannot wait
until a final judgment; he would be left in a
difficult position if be could not draw immediately at least the amount of the offer. I am
not sure, but I think either clause 14 or clause
15 deals with that point.
Hon. Mr. Urquhart: If the Crown makes a
firm offer of compensation to the owner or
the tenant, and the owner or tenant accepts
that offer, then the owner or tenant is entitled
to payment forthwith by the Crown. The offer
is made to him and payment is made on an

February 18, 1970

unconditional and without prejudice basis,
which means that he then can proceed in the
Exchequer Court to get higher compensation-or less, whichever the court decides.
Does that answer your question?

SENATE DEBATES
These have been full-time students, but the
Government should 'also give serious consideration to giving this form of assistance to
part-time students. I agree with Senator Cameron that there are many thousands of such
students who are desperately striving to
upgrade their education to get better employment or to improve their standards in order
to secure promotions in their jobs or
professions.
I think that the time has come for the
Government to look beyond the scope of this
act and to begin to provide real assistance to
high-calibre university students, who for
financial reasons are not able to carry on.
Many provinces have instituted scholarship
programs, something that can be done much
better by the federal Government, particularly at higher and specialized levels.
In previous debates on student loans, I drew
attention to the serious problem of the braindrain to the United States. Annually, highlytrained scientists, engineers, university teachers, physicians and surgeons, who have been
educated at a high cost to Canada, emigrate
to our southern neighbour, where they take
up employment and settle down. It has been
estimated that it requires from $50,000 to
$60,000 of public money to produce a Ph.D.,
which is a complete loss if such a person
leaves Canada permanently.
I believe the Government could considerably reduce this outflow of brain-power if it
adopted a scheme similar to the one existing
in the Canadian Northwest Territories. There
the loan to a student attending university
becomes an outright grant if after graduation
he returns to the Territories and lives there
for at least four years. Such a scheme applied
under the Student Loans Act throughout
Canada would do much to keep our highlyeducated graduates in our country and would
benefit the growth of science, technology,
industry and education, all of which contribute to the well-being of our society and
country.
The seriousness of the brain-drain becomes
apparent from a report of Peter Y. Comay of
Princeton University, in a special study for
the Department of Manpower and Immigration in Canada. Here are some significant
findings of this study, as summarized in the
London Free Press of January 8, 1970:
Canadians annually account for more
than 25 per cent of professional manpower migration to the U.S. from all
countries.
[Hon. Mr. Yuzyk.]

February 18, 1970

Nearly nine per cent of all Canada's
professionals emigrated to the U.S. in
1953-63. This percentage rose to about 20
or more for chemists and engineers.
Thirty per cent of all Canadian graduate students-those with doctorateswent to the U.S. in 1965-66.
The number of Canadian university
students in the U.S. rose by more than
400 per cent to 12,117 in 1966-67 from
2,676 in 1946-47.
Canadian salaries in industry and Government trail those in the U.S. by as
much as 40 per cent.
U.S.-educated Canadians are more
likely to seek jobs in the U.S. than those
educated in this country. And the higher
the education level, the greater the likelihood of migration to the U.S.
The average age of those migrating is
30. Children in the family reduce only
slightly the probability of migration.
Salary differentials as big as $2,000 a
year change the likelihood of migration
by only two or three per cent.
About one-third of migrants return to
Canada, after an average stay of 2ý
years in the U.S. Those with doctorates
are least likely to return.
The report states that Canada could
decrease the emigration of scientists and engineers "without having to match American
salaries". It is recommended that Canada
should continue to expand graduate studies
programs and that there should be special
attractions to retrieve migrants. The most
important factor which attracts Canadian
university graduates to the U.S.A. is the convenience of finding jobs and the prospects of
promotion. Consequently, the Government
must find ways and means to stimulate the
expansion of science, technology, and particularly innovation in industry and government
facilities, and to provide job information.
I believe that special attention should be
devoted to the problem of our brain-drain. I
cannot see that much progress will be
achieved in this direction until the Government adopts an overall science and technology policy which will be co-ordinated and carried out throughout the various departments
of government by a minister charged with
that responsibility. Furthermore, Canada is
confronted with the problem of the imbalance
of the education and training of scientists,
engineers, medical specialists, et cetera. In
some fields there is an over-production of

SENATE DEBATES
Some criticisms were voiced when Bill
C-135 was under debate in the other house,
but these criticisms were based either on misconceptions, or on a misunderstanding of the
main act. For example, there were complaints
that the loan of $1,000 per year was not
enough to cover student expenses, and that its
value had been seriously eroded during the
past five years by inflation. It was also felt
that a total debt burden of $5,000 could have
a more serious impact on a student from a
poor family than on the student from a middle-class family. It was contended that
because of his psychological reaction to debt,
the poor student would be more likely to
want to get rid of his debt burden as quickly
as possible, and to do so he might choose a
career which would enable him to attain that
objective rather than a career in which his
talents could be most usefully employed for
his own satisfaction, or in which be might
make his best contribution to the good of his
country and his fellow man.
These criticisms overlook the fact that the
Canada Student Loans Act is but one part of
the student aid program. It also overlooks the
fact that many provinces have student loan
programs of their own, and in some cases
these are integrated with the federal program. lIt must also be remembered that bursaries and scholarships from various sources
also form part of the student aid program
though, no doubt, good use could be found for
a wider range of scholarships than is at present available.
There were also complaints of discrimination-of students from well-to-do families
getting loans and students from poor families
being refused. To answer these criticisms it is
necessary to be clear about what the Canada
Student Loans Act does not do. For example:
1. It does not set up a federal loan fund out
of which the loans are made. The money
loaned to students is not federal money. It is
the money of the lending institutions. The
only federal money expended is for interest
on loans, and for uncollectible loans that have
been guaranteed by the federal Government.
2. It does not prescribe any age limit for
students applying for loans.
3. It does not set out criteria or conditions
of eligibility. It simply specifies that the student must prescribe a certificate of eligibility.
This certificate of eligibility is granted by the
provincial authority. At the end of 1969, 492,000 eligibility certificates had been issued for
a total loan of $298.4 million.
[Hon. Mr. Carter.]

4. It does not select or set forth any criteria
for the selection of educational institutions on
the basis of attendance at which student loans
might be granted or refused. This too is
determined by the provincial authorities.
The criteria for the selection of such educational institutions and the eligibility of students have been worked out in an interprovincial committee, and represent a consensus
of all the provincial authorities including
Quebec, which does not participate in the
program. One would expect, therefore, that
these criteria are administered fairly uniformly across Canada. Some variation is
bound to exist, but it should not be of serious
proportions.

If, however, such discrimination as that
complained of does exist, it is something that
can only be corrected by the province concerned. It is not due to any defect in the
Canada Student Loans Act or in the bill now
before us, and, in fact, it cannot be remedied
by any federal legislation.
The chief criticism of this legislation is the
one pointed out by Senator Cameron when he
introduced this bill in that it does not make
any provision for loans to part-time students.
I should like to support Senator Cameron's
recommendation in this regard, and to add
also a special plea of my own that provision
be made for the granting of student loans to
teachers who at great sacrifice spend their
summer vacations taking courses to improve
their academic standing.
In Canada, constitutionally, education
comes mainly under provincial jurisdiction,
but due to the rapid changes taking place all
around us and in the world at large, education is becoming more and more an area of
national concern and this trend will increase
as years go by.
Some speakers in the other place, while
debating this bill, claimed that every Canadian child had the right to a university education and that university education should be
provided free of charge without the necessity
of student loans. If a Canadian child has the
right to a university education, I suppose
every other child in the world, no matter
where he lives, must have a similar right.
However, as far as Canada is concerned, since
our human resources are our most valuable
resources, to the extent that we regard money
spent on education as an investment in the
development of these resources this argument
may have some validity. Be that as it may,
there is no doubt in my mind that every
Canadian child, regardless of the part of
Canada in which he happens to be born, has

February 18, 1970

DEBATES

a right to an equal opportunity to, develop his
talents and abilities to bis full potential. The
responsibiity for seeing that that right is
recognized and fulfflled certainly rests with
the national Government. It is a right that the
provincial governments, by their very nature,
are powerless to enforce.
Furthermore, we know now that education
is a prime factor in determining the rate of
growth of our economy; in expanding our
G.N.P.; in improving our research and development; i enabling our technological development to keep pace with that of other
lndustrialized countries; in making the best
use of our manpower resources; in our attack
on regional disparity, and ini our attack on
poverty and environental problems. These
are ail areas of national concern and national
responsibility, and in s0 far as education is a
key factor in ail these matters, the federal
Government must of necesslty become
involved i it.
In terms of dollars, federal involvement in
education today is quite considerable, but ini
ternis of method, no matter how much cooperation is forthcoming from the provincial
authorities, it can hardly be regarded as satîsfactory. Indirect involvement such as we have
today usually results in arriving at the lowest
common denominator, and that is certainly
not good enough. To cope successfuily with
the problems that face us today, the federal
Governent wiil have to become more directly involved in education than it is at the
present time. This is a matter at which the
proposed joint comxnittee on the Constitution
should take a good hard look.
Apart from the right of equal opportunity,
the requirements for economic growth and
for the solution of national problems, there
are two other reasons why the federal Government must become more directly involved
in education. One is the spiralling cost of
education, particularly of the educational
plant, the buildings, equipment and facilities.
The educational burden is getting too great
even for the richest provinces to bear, even
though they pass a large share of the burden
on to the municipalities. School taxes on
property owners in urban areas are now so
heavy that they must be approaching the
point of diminishing returns.
It is ail very weil for provincial governments to say to the federal Governent,
"Give us more money and we'1l spend it on
education as we see fit". Under present circumstances I do not think the federal Government would be acting responsibly if it accepted that proposition.

Hon. Mr. Flynn: Why not?
Hon. Mr. Carter: For one authority to tax
and another authority to spend is neyer a
sound principle. The taxing authority should
be the spending authority. When federal
funds are spent, the federal Government has
a responsibility to the taxpayers, and to discharge that responsibility it must have some
voice regarding the nature of the expenditures and some control. over them.

Hon. Mr. Carter: The organization of elementary and high school education in Canada
is chaotic. Despite consultations between vanious provincial departmnents in an effort to
achieve a degree of uniformity, we have in
Canada ten separate provincial jurisdictions
with ten different curricula and ten different
organizations of grades. Some have six elementary, two junior high and three high
school grades; some with a "six-three-two"
grade organization; some with a "six-threethree" and others with a "six-three-four"
organization.
We also have tan different systems of
teacher training and ten different methods of
teacher certification. This constitutas barriers
which prevent a certified teacher in one province from teaching as a certified teacher in
another province-

DEBATES

In addition to the skyrocketing of costs and
the fantastic increase in knowledge already
referred to, a unified system, for Canada wil
have to take into account the following additional facts: First, the fact that it is possible
for a child with normal intelligence to learn
as much in the first nine years of his life as
in the remainder of his life span. Secondly,
there is in Canada an acute shortage of properly trained and experienced teachers, and on
a per-student basis this shortage can be
expected to increase rather than diminish.
Thirdly, maximum use must be made of al
the newest teaching techniques and equipment as they become available. This will
include the use of radio, television, computers
and electronic devices that will provide direct
contact between a specialized teacher or
groups of teachers in an education centre and
the student in his class at school, or even in
bis home. This means a drastie revision and
modernization of our existing systems from
pre-school and kindergarten rîght through to
the graduate level of the university and
beyond.
ln this new system one must expect greater
emphasis on the true meaning of education;
that is, the development of the talents and
innate capacities of the child to, the fullest
possible extent; rather than forcing facts and
bits of unrelated information into the child's
mind and enabling hlm to hold on to it until
examination day, when hie can pour it out
again on paper and promptly forget ail about
it.
The universities too must become genuine
centres of learning, where seholars can
pursue their search for truth in the fields in
which they are interested, rather than the
glorified high sehools which many of them
now are. In many countries, universities have
become centres of perversion, filth and lawlessness. This is particuiarly noticeable in our
neighbour to the south, and while it may flot
be so widespread in Canadian universities
there is evidence that the trend does exist.
The concern voiced by Senator Quart last
Thursday is most timely.
Today colleges and universities are offering
a wider variety of courses than ever before.
Improved educational technology is providing
better
teaching
techniques,
techniques
unheard of even a few years ago. Social restrictions are out and student freedom is in.
Co-educational living is becoming total from
dining room to dormitory. Stiil, for an
increasing: number of students, in some cases
the majority of students, coilege has become a

drag-an unrewarding, unsatisfying, frustrating experience. Young people find life hopeless, purposeless and worthless. To an alarming degree college students in increasing
numbers are dropping out, rejecting family,
society, the world, and ail too often abandoning life itself.
This phenomenon is very apparent in colleges in the United States, but it is not entirely absent in Canada either. It is clear that
coileges and universities are not answering
the big questions about life that the youth are
asking. What is man? Where did hie come
from? Where is hie heading? What is the purpose of life? Why is man making such a
miserable mess of things? It is equaily clear
that college education is not helping them to
solve their problems. It is not answering the
big questions that wouid give them peace of
mind. Neither is coilege giving them the solid
practical guidelines for achieving successful
happy lives. It is flot pointing them towards
any goal in life that is worthy of total
commitment.
Clearly something is very wrong with our
university education. There is a missing
dimension. They are not turning out educated
people. An educated person is not one with a
head full of technical facts, not the suave
sophisticate, not the shrewd wheeler-dealer
with the mind of a computer and the tactics
of a shark. The two distinguishing marks of
an educated person are moral wisdom and
moral courage-the moral wisdom to know
right fromn wrong with absolute certainty and
the moral courage to stand for what is right
in the face of every obstacle. Our colleges and
universities tend to mass produce clever specialists trained to function i narrow scientific
or business fields. They are grinding out
people who possess great technical knowledge
and skill, but who are not balanced in their
understanding or their approach to life.
Where is our present system of education
leading us? Dr. Orley R. Herron, Associate
Professor of Education at the University of
Mississippi, answers this question as foilows:
It is paradoxical but true that there is
a persistent but growing feeling that
higher education is drifting towards
PurDoselessness.
This quotation was taken from the February
1968 issue of College and University Business.
Dr. Robert M. Hutchins, former President
of the University of Chicago, is more specific.
In the Human Dialogue, page 322, hie warns:
If the object of education is the
improvement; of men, then any system of

SENATE DEBATES
education that is without values is a contradiction in terms. A system that seeks
bad values is bad. A system that denies
the existence of values denies the possibility of education.
He then concluded:
Relativism, scientism, scepticism and
anti-intellectualism, the four horsemen of
the philosophical apocalypse, have produced that chaos in education which will
end in the disintegration of the West.
Clearly a crisis exists in education, though
few seem to be aware of it. As far as Canada
is concerned, an in-depth, nation-wide inquiry
should be carried out by a royal commission,
Senate committee or some appropriate body
acceptable to provincial and federal authorities so that defects can be pinpointed and
remedial action taken before it is too late.
Hon. Muriel McQ. Fergusson: Honourable
senators, this bill, which provides for amendments to the Canada Student Loans Act
passed in 1964, was thoroughly explained by
Senator Cameron in his excellent speech when
introducing the bill in this chamber. I do not
propose to comment on these amendments
other than to say I am pleased that such a
substantial amount has been allocated for the
loan year commencing July 1, 1970, and that
in subsequent years the allocation will be
increased
according to the percentage
increase in total post-secondary enrolment in
that year. This seems to me a much more
practical way of providing the amount of
assistance in accordance with the size of the
actual student population than the provision
for escalation allowed in the act as it stands.
The studies of the Special Senate Committee on Poverty have made members of that
committee very conscious of the fact that lack
of education or training is one of the underlying causes of poverty. From briefs presented
to that committee and from listening to evidence given to it by unemployed persons who
are willing and anxious to work, the members
have learned that lack of education and training is also one of the great causes of unemployment today. In fact, it is the undereducated and the untrained who make up the
bulk of our unemployed. Lack of education
and training is the cause of poverty. On the
other hand, poverty is often the cause of
many people being unable to secure education
or training. This is a vicious circle that must
be broken if we in Canada are going to make
the best possible use of our human resources,
[Hon. Mr. Carter.]

February 18, 1970

as well as our physical resources. We will not
be able to break that vicious circle until all
Canadians are able to receive the education
and training that will enable each one of
them to make his or her maximum contribution to the life of Canada.
A person born into a poor or very large
family, or in a region where educational
facilities are poor, should not be deprived for
that reason of enjoying the right to education
or training. Nevertheless, in Canada many
such persons are so deprived because he or
she was born under the conditions I have
described.
The Canada Student Loans Act, together
with existing provincial legislation which provides for additional assistance, has made it
possible for many thousands of students to
receive post-secondary training and education
which they otherwise could not possibly have
received. In 1964, the first year of the operation of the act, 42,000 students received loans
amounting to $26 million. In 1968-1969, 107,000 students received loans amounting to $66
million, and it is expected that this year the
volume of loans could approach $90 million.
I had the privilege of introducing the Student Loans Bill in the Senate in 1964, and I
remember well that the principal premise
underlying the needs assessment in this legislation is that primary responsibility for meeting individual costs of post-secondary education lies with the student or his family. I am
sure we all recall that at one time the
responsibility for all education, elementary,
secondary or post-secondary, fell on the parents. The responsibility for elementary and
secondary education has now been accepted
by the provinces, and it is my hope that
eventually responsibility for post-secondary
education will also become a public
responsibility.
However, honourable senators, post-secondary education is not a public responsibility
today, and I accept the premise that this
responsibility at present falls on the student
or his parents. I enthusiastically support the
Student Loans legislation because it gives
ambitious and responsible students an opportunity to secure post-secondary education or
training, an opportunity which but for this
legislation many of them would not have and
without which they are at great disadvantage
in our present day world.
There are some areas not covered by this
legislation. I would like to refer to part-time
students about whom Senator Cameron spoke
in his introductory speech and about whom

February 18, 1970

SENATE DEBATES

both Senator Yuzyk and Senator Carter have
spoken. I would like to see the provisions of
the act extended to part-time students. Many
people who must work to earn money to support themselves and their families are taking
night classes. They are giving up summer
vacations to attend summer school in order to
secure a degree or certificate or other qualification necessary to achieve promotion where
they are working or a better position elsewhere. It is well known that to acquire a
degree at night school or summer school often
takes 10 years or more. In this age of giving
preference to youth-and this is so whether
we approve of it or not-it often happens
that the person who has worked so hard for
so long to secure his degree or certificate
finds he is competing for a position with
younger persons who are equally èquipped
with knowledge and degrees, but only
because of the help provided them through
the Student Loans Act. The older person is
placed at a disadvantage, and I feel that in all
fairness some consideration should be given to
providing financial help for him or her as
well.
I am not sure if the summer school session
would be considered as a semester. As you
know, we are now able to give loans for
semesters as well as for terms. This is one of
the provisions of this bill. If a session in
summer school is considered a semester, then
I should think that the amendment contained
in clause 2 would authorize loans to be made
to those attending summer school for the purpose of obtaining a degree. I read the report
of the committee of the other place which
studied this bill, but I was not able to ascertain whether such a summer school session
would be considered a semester. Perhaps we
can find this out when this bill goes to a
Senate committee. If a summer school session
is not considered a semester, then summer
school students who are working for degrees,
as well as part-time students, would not be
eligible for the financial assistance which is
given to full-time students under the Student
Loans Act. In all probability, summer school
students and part-time students are in as
great need, if not greater.
I am supported in this idea by an article
which appeared in the Toronto Daily Star on
May 14, 1969. It was written by D. McCormack Smyth, the retiring Dean of Atkinson
College, York University. He was quoted as
saying that student loans were inadequate
and unfair. I will not deal with the inadequacy aspect, because probably that is being cov21498-38

ered by the present amendment. In connection
with the unfairness aspect, Mr. Smyth said:
-the Canada student loans scheme is
unfairly discriminatory. The reasons why
part-time university students are not eligible for the loans are not clear. Perhaps
they were excluded because many of
them work and have incomes.
Federal legislation helps all students
with taxable incomes, whether or not
they are full-time or part-time students.
That same principle should be operative
under the Canada Student Loans Plan,
for the following reasons:
1. The latest Dominion Bureau of Statistics report giving details on the median
family income of university students
indicates that the family income of a student whose education was interrupted
was $4,201 as compared with the family
income of $5,921 for the families of students who had no interruption in their
education.
If the interruption in a student's education results in his being able to study
only part-time, such a student is not eligible for a student loan.
2. Over the next decade, in Canada, it
is likely that there will be little increase
in the number of male workers in the age
group 30-45.
There will be heavy demands on the
potential managerial and technical skills
available in this important age group.
The continuing education of people in
this group will be a major social need. In
order to insure that they continue their
education, financial incentives are desirable.
According to figures from the Dominion
Bureau of Statistics, full-time enrolment of
students at universities in Canada for 1967-68
was 261,027. According to the report of the
Canada Student Loans' Act for 1967-68, the
latest report available, 70,126 such students
received loans.
I have not been able to secure exact figures
for the number of part-time students on the
route to degrees, but the figures I do have
indicate there are between 100,000 and 150,000 such persons. None of those are eligible
for student loans under the act, and I feel
serious consideration should be given to passing legislation to help these students.
I would also like to see provision for loans
to women who are trying to get a degree
through taking part-time classes or night

SENATE DEBATES
classes. Such provision would enable them to
hire baby sitters to look after their children
during their absence. Many brilliant women
could and would take post-secondary education or training, preparing themselves for
excellent positions that would well take care
of their family responsibilities, if they could
borrow the little money that would be necessary to pay someone to look after their children during their absence at classes.
Honourable senators may think I am straying into the welfare field here, but beyond
any social significance, such provisions would
produce much better trained and educated
women. For years after their children have
grown and left home, those women would be
part of the labour market and would be able
to support themselves. They would not be
dependent on welfare, as they might be if
they were prevented from taking adult education or training. Lacking that education, they
might well become dependent even on public
assistance. These women, if enabled to secure
training, would be qualified to fill many
Canadian requirements for trained, skilled
and educated persons. There are many of
those positions open and we are not able to
fill them because we do not have in Canada a
sufficient number of trained and educated
people.
One thing I found surprising is the comparatively small number of loans granted
under the plan to students attending vocational and technical training institutions. The
1967-68 report shows that, in addition to the
70,126 loans granted to students attending
Canadian universities to which I referred,
loans were granted also to students at teacher
institutions, vocational training
training
schools and universities outside Canada. The
total of ýall these was 91,626. Of this number,
only 10,016 loans were granted to students
attending vocational and technical schools.
With the increasing demand for persons
with technical skills and the increasing
number of such institutions which are giving
this kind of training, I would expect that a
much larger number of students applying for
loans would be taking vocational and technical training courses to enable them to fill such
positions. This is also something we could find
out about in committee.
I realize that the provinces decide on who
is going to receive the loans, but I am wondering if any special emphasis is put on
having the students go to universities rather
than to technical schools. It is something I
would like to know.
[Hon. Mrs. Fergusson.]

February 18,1970

Honourable senators, before closing I want
to refer to criticisms that have appeared in
the press and have intimated that students
borrowing under the Student Loans Act are
not living up to their obligations.
At the end of the fourth year of the operation of the act, which was June 30, 1968, the
latest for which we have a report, 142,000
students had taken out student loans, and
66,400 had ceased to be students and had
become responsible for regular payments of
principal and interest. Most of these had
taken a mature and responsible attitude
towards payment, about 93 per cent of them
meeting their obligations on a regular basis.
Another 3.5 per cent had encountered difficulties, such as illness or inability to get fulltime employment, but were able to make
satisfactory arrangements with the lender for
extension of time for payment. Only 3.5 per
cent had tried to evade responsibility. They
had done this either by moving away and not
leaving a new address with the lender, or
they had actually refused to enter into the
new agreement with the lender-the consolidated agreement arranged for in the act.
Honourable senators, I am sure many of
you observed that the press made a great deal
of this in the fall of 1968, giving figures and
intimating that the amount of loans outstanding was very high. But when you realize that
the amount then owing had all been recovered except for the 3.5 per cent which was
going to be recovered over a longer period,
and that only 3.5 per cent was left-much of
which has now been recovered-it seems that
this is a very small figure, considering the 93
per cent who lived up to their obligations
without any question whatever.
Hon. Mr. Martin: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mrs. Fergusson: I look forward to
receiving the report of the student loans plan
for the year 1968-69, which I think we will be
receiving quite soon. I have every reason to
believe that it will be just as good as the last
one, if not better. I heartily support the bill.
Hon. Donald Cameron: Honourable senatorsThe Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, I should inform you that if the honourable Senator Cameron speaks now, his speech
will have the effect of closing the debate.
Hon. Mr. Cameron: Honourable senators,
first may I say I am delighted with the qual-

February 18, 1970

Febrary18. 970SENATE
DEBATES

ity of the presentation in this debate on what
is an increasingly important topic in Canada,
education.
Hon. Mr. Martin: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Cameron: It is also gratifying to
realize that the topic education has been discussed in this chamber with increasing frequency ini recent years, which is as it should
be.
The loans to post-secondary education have
been exceedingly productive. Many of you
will remember what happened imimediately
after the war when loans were provided to
enable men returning from the services either
to start their university education or to complete an interrupted program. The resuits
were spectacularly successful. I think the
same can be said of this particular program.
I should Uike to comment on one or two of
the statements made by my predecessors.
Senator Quart referred to the need in universities for emphasis on greater standards, of
higher quaiity in the universities. 1 should
like to second that plea heartily. As one who
has spent bis life in education-40 years next
May 15-1 feel somewhat concerned when I
see the attitude of certain students, particularly in the non-professional faculties, the
sloppiness, and the lack of discipline, in both
thinking and in action. I think this is a matter
of serious concern and is one about which
universities have been somewhat lax. I hope
that in the future they wili place more
emphasis not only on the quality of education
off ered and on the methods of instruction,
which I think can be greatly improved, as
Senator Carter indicated, but also on certain
standards which we expect from ail university students and from whom, we have a right
to expect a high standard of conduct.
With respect to Senator Yuzyk's commenta
on the brain-drain, this is something we hear
a good deal about, but the trend has been
reversing itself in recent years. It has been
reversing for two or three reasons. The main
reason is that in Canada academnic salaries
have undergone a great upward revision in
recent years. They now compare very favourably with salaries in academic institutions of
comparable grade in the United States. Similarly, salaries in industry and in the public
service in Canada have gone up, with the
resuit that more of the people who went to
the United States are returning. The point is
21498-381

that the people who do migrate to the United
States are not staying as long as they used to
and more of them. are returning.
The second reason for the return to Canada
of students at the post-graduate level is the
increasing uneasiness about the social climate
in the United States. Not only are students
returning but 1 know of dozens of professors
who have bought land in Canada because
they are unhappy about situations in some of
the Amnerican universities and they want to
get away.
Then, coming to Senator Carter's remarks, 1
should like to emphasize that the Canada Student Loans Act was neyer intended to cover
the complete cost of education. If we had the
power to dip into a bottornless purse for
funds, I do not think I would ever be in
favour of giving a completely free programi of
education.
Hon. Mr. McDonald: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Cameron: It is my experience thal
people do not; appreciate what they get toc
easily. But more important than that is the
fact that the student, the participant or
beneficiary, must make some contribution,
whatever it may be. So, instead of saying that
every student in this country has a right to a
university education, 1 would place the
emphasis the other way and say that every
student has the right to the opportunity for a
university education, which is something
quite different. And he is getting that opportunity through legislation such as the Canada
Student Loans Act.
Senator Carter emphasized a good point,
that the money did not come from the federal
treasury. However, the federal treasury does
pay the interest. Funds are provided through
the standard loaning institutions, and I think
the number of institutions may be extended
in the next revision of the act.
Senator Carter also talked about the need
for federal involvement in education, and I
agree with that. I realize that there are
constitutional problems. Over the years the
federal Government has given great aid to
various educational projects, and there was
no problem as long as they did not refer to
the termi "education". I remember that the
Canadian Youth and Vocational Training Act
was given effect to in 1937; it was one of the
first programs of the kind. It was certainly
educational in the way it was applied, and
there was no problem as long as they did not

SENATE DEBATES
refer to it as an educational program. My
reaction was that I did not care what it was
called as long as we got the money to achieve
a certain purpose.
We are gradually improving the attitudes
with respect to education at the federal level,
and I expect that the day will come when we
will have an arrangement whereby the federal Government may participate more openly
and actively than it has in the past. It is
doing a lot now, in fact.
Senator Carter referred to the high cost of
education. I think there is no question but
that we can get more effective value for the
educational dollar than we are getting now.
We can squeeze a good deal of fat out of
many of the university programs without
injuring the educational content in them. So, I
have some sympathy for the provincial governments and others who are taking a hard
look at education and are placing some ceilings on the amount of money provided for it.
Senator Fergusson raised an interesting
question when she asked whether summer
school courses could be taken as the equivalent of a university semester. I am surprised at
the oversight in this respect, in that this has
not been done before, because in terms of
hours it is quite possible to get the equivalent
of semester hours in a six-week summer session. I have done this in Banff for years. In
fact, I have given more hours in a six-week
course than bas been the case in many of the
two-course
semester systems
in many
instances. This is an example of where the
act could be amended with a great deal of
benefit.
Also mentioned was the question of loans
for teacher training. It is a deplorable fact
that not a larger number take advantage of
the program-that is, of teachers and students
in technical schools. I think one of the
answers to that may be that many of the
provinces have had their own loan schemes
for teachers ante-dating the Student Loans
Act, and large numbers of teachers, going
back to the late 1940s and earlier, were able
to take advantage of this fact and were able
to get their teacher training programs set up
specifically to aid in teacher training.
To summarize, since this program was initiated in 1964-65, approximately 353,999 students have taken advantage of it at a cost of
$227.7 million, or an average loan per student
of $672. I think this has been a great invest[Hon. Mr. Cameron.]

ment for Canada and one which will pay
dividends in the future in terms of very high
percentages.
I hope that this legislation will come back
next year for further amendment and that we
will make provision to take care of the parttime students and the summer school students
as well. I urge the passage of this bill.

Hon. Paul Martin, pursuant to Notice,
moved:
That the Standing Senate Committee
on Legal and Constitutional Affairs be

instructed to consider and, from time to
time, to report on procedures for the
review by the Senate of instruments
made in virtue of any statute of the Parliament of Canada, and to consider in
connection therewith any public documents relevant thereto.
He said: Honourable senators, yesterday I
took occasion to remind senators of the existence of a report presented in the other place
on statutory instruments. This report will
serve as part of my material in support of this
motion that stands in my name.
The subject-matter of this motion is important. The laws of the land in one sense do
not all derive directly from statute law. They
derive, of course, from statute law passed by
both Houses of Parliament, but also out of
delegated legislation-that is to say, authority
given in statute that will have the eff ect of
law when acted upon by those responsible for
the administration of the law.
There are also laws made by judicial
process. We are not concerned with the
judicial law making. It is important that the
Senate should consider whether it is as functional a body as the other place in respect to
supervising delegated legislation.
It would seem that in the light of the practice in the House of Lords and the Australian
Parliament there is a special role for upper
chambers in respect of delegated legislation.
The Leader of the Opposition and I in discussing this matter have agreed as to its
importance. Of course, it is not intended that
we should resolve the matter today. He has
intimated that at the conclusion of my
remarks he proposes to adjourn this debate.
That is satisfactory to me. I hope that what I
say will serve to introduce the subject, and to
remind senators of the opportunity and,
indeed, the responsibility we have in connection with this matter.
In the first paragraph of the preface to the
report it is stated:
This report is based on the assumption
that public knowledge of governmental
activities is the basis of all control of
delegated legislation. For parliamentary
democracy is a system of government
which requires that the executive be
responsible to the legislature, and that
both be accountable to the people, and
that there can be neither responsibility

SENATE DEBATES
Having mentioned Senator O'Leary, I should
like to say that I am sure we offer him our
warmest congratulations on the anniversary
of his birthday today.
Hon. Senalors: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Martin: The Regulations Act was
passed in 1950, and its purpose was to ensure
that all orders, regulations and proclamations
made in the exercise of legislative powers
delegated by Parliament were published, and
also were tabled in Parliament in a systematic and unified manner. The act made tabling
and publication compulsory, and it set out a
system for tabling and publication. Its provisions, honourable senators will recall, were
adopted after comparative studies of procedures in other countries, in particular the
United Kingdom, and in the light of experience gained by Parliament with the workings
of the Statutory Orders and Regulation Order
which was in force during and after the war.
The definition of regulations in the Regulations Act was broader than in the Statutory
Orders and Regulations Order. The Act
required that ail regulations be tabled in Parliament and published in Part II of the
Canada Gazette. It did provide, however, that
the Governor-General might by order in
council exempt any regulation or class of
regulation from the tabling and publishing
provisions of the act, but any exempting
order had to be published and tabled in
accordance with the provisions of the act.
Many regulations are exempted from the
tabling and publication provisions of the act,
such as administrative orders and rulings,
directives to aircraft, vessels and vehicles and
some rules of a temporary character and
some for security reasons.
The intention of the act is to ensure that ail
regulations enforced are brought to the attention of Parliament and the public so that the
public and Parliament are aware of that
legislation and to put Parliament in a position
where it may, if it wishes, ask the enacting
authority to explain the reasons for the regulation, and take any other action it thinks
necessary.
The provisions of the Regulations Act are
under frequent review by the Privy Council
Office and the Department of Justice.
Finally, because of the tabling requirement
of the Regulations Act, Parliament is
informed of the enactment of regulations and
it may make inquiries with respect to them as
[Hon. Mr. Martin.]

February 19, 1970

it feels necessary. Either House of Parliament
may take action at any time to investigate
complaints with respect to the operation of
any subordinate legislation or any delegated
legislation.
Now, it is against this background of our
practice that a committee in the other place
was invited in September 1968 to do what I
am now inviting this house to do, that is, to
consider and report upon procedures for the
review by this bouse of instruments made in
virtue of any statute of the Parliament of
Canada.
The report in question begins by asserting
that as a general rule there should be public
knowledge of the processes of delegated legislation before, during, and after the making of
regulations, and that any derogation by Government from this rule requires justification.
In its own words, the committee has said
that it stresses the principle of the responsibility of the executive to Parliament for delegated legislation as well as for the enactment
of statutes.
The committee proposes to implement this
principle in four ways. First, it proposes that
the Government consult fully with the public
and with parliamentary standing committees
Second, it

before
proposes an extension of the ambit of the
present internal scrutiny of regulations by the
Privy Council Office and the Department of
Justice during the making of regulations.
Third, it proposes full publication of regulations after they have been made with limited
exceptions. Fourth, it proposes the establishment of a new parliamentary standing committee on regulations to provide for public
scrutiny of those regulations.
As a member of the Government at this
time I am not in a position to say that I agree
with these proposais.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: Which proposals?
Hon. Mr. Martin: The four I have just
enumerated. I am not saying that the Government will not support them. I am saying
that I am not in a position at the present time
to go further than I have. I say that a committee to which this matter will be referred
will have the opportunity of making the same
kind of review that was made in the other
place. It may or may not agree with these
four proposais, but it would be helpful for us
to have the view of the Senate. The Senate
has more time and in some other respects is
the body best suited to be the examining
agency. It may be decided that it could be

February 19, 1970

SENATE DEBATES

done by joint arrangement. I do know that in
the United Kingdom, where they have made
the greatest advance, the agency for continuing examination is provided by the Upper
House.
The committee also dealt with the problem
of making regulations. It recommended that
the scope of the definition of "regulation" be
extended to include many departmental
directives and guidelines which previously
had not been considered "regulations" at all.
The inclusion of the directives within the
definition of "regulation" is important. I am
sure we will agree, because such directives
would be subject to the Regulation Act,
which provides safeguards on the regulationdrafting procedures.
The committee took the view that the
establishment of guidelines for enabling
legislation which confers on the executive the
right to make delegated legislation was
important. These guidelines include such
principles as, "the authority to make regulations should not be granted in subjective
terms;" that "the precise limits of the lawmaking power which Parliament intended to
confer should be defined in clear language;"
and that "there should be no power to make
regulations having a retrospective effect."
The committee next dealt with the problem
of preliminary consultation. It suggested that
regulation-making authorities engage in the
widest possible consultation, not only with
directly affected interest, but with the public
at large.
In the section dealing with the drafting of
regulations, the Committee on Statutory
Instruments recommended the expansion of
the legislative section of the Department of
Justice. I pass no judgment on that at this
time.
I might add here that one of the rare skills
in the Government service is competent
draftsmanship, and we all owe much to those
few draftsmen whom we have. It is for this
reason that the Minister of Justice announced
the other day that his department is cooperating with the University of Ottawa Law
School to provide training for draftsmen.

committee of the cabinet knows that that is
the case. They are overworked. It is not easy
to get draftsmen. They do a remarkably good
job, given the circumstances under which
they operate.
Hon. Mr. Flynn:
circumstances.

They

are

difficult

Hon. Mr. Martin: The committee dealt with
the publication of regulations and recommended that all regulations, regardless of the
regulation-making authority, be available for
public inspection. I do not pass on that, either.
It may be that there are some-there certainly are regulations which, in the interests of
the security of the state, cannot at a given
moment be available for public inspection.
This is a supportable position to take.
The committee urged that a parliamentary
committee be established to scrutinize all
regulations and to refer them in some cases to
other standing committees of Parliament for
further consideration.
That committee would then be in a position
to examine regulations on the basis of five
suggested criteria. First, whether they were
authorized under the terms of the enabling
statute; second, whether they appear to make
some unusual or unexpected use of the
powers conferred by the statute under which
they are made, even though they are technically within the four corners of the statute;
third, whether the regulations infringe unduly
on some civil right.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: I am sorry to interrupt the
honourable Leader of the Government, but
may I suggest to him that the flrst two problems that he has mentioned are dealt with
very easily. For instance, clause 11 of Bill
S-14 says that the Governor in Council may
make regulations (a), (b), (c), (d) and (e) I
quote:
(e) generally, for carrying out the purposes and provisions of this Act.
In those general ternis, with an over-all
provision, it is very difficult to say whether a
matter is within the framework of the act.

Hon. Mr. Martin: In principle that is correct. This is the kind of matter that was of
concern to the committee on statutory instruments. I am sure that we would want to have

the draftsmen appear to be overworked.
The fourth suggested criterion is whether

publication or laying before Parliament; fifth,
whether the regulations are an abuse of
power in so far as they could come into force
before they are transmitted to the Clerk of
the Privy Council or unjustifiably fail to provide that they shall not come into force until
some later day; sixth and finally, whether for
any particular reason their form or objective
is vague and needs further clarification.
It is interesting to note that the two bestknown committees on delegated legislation,
those of the British House of Lords and the
Australian Senate, are committees of the
Upper Chamber.
Dr. Kersell is perhaps Canada's leading
authority on the subject of delegated legislation. He is author of a book entitled
Parliamentary Supervision of Delegated
Legislation. At page 74 of that book he says
it would appear from a comparison of
the Australian Senate Committee and the
British House of Commons Committeo that,
useful as the House Conimittee is, an Upper
Chamber committee enjoys a number of significant advantages, even over a joint committee, which made it more effective.
Undoubtedly the most important of these
advantages is that its actions and utterances
do not threaten the stability of the government. Thus the committee can be left free to
scrutinize instruments on broad terms of reference, initially, perhaps, of its own choosing,
which do not exclude substantive matters. Its
reports, even when highly critical of the substance of delegated legislation are likely to be
considered on their merits and not on party
lines. The Australian Government has on at
least four major occasions found it possible to
meet the criticisms of the Senate Committee
by making appropriate concessions rather
than by "stone-walling" for a time before
quietly implementing necessary changes.
A second chamber and its committees, in
addition, are not as squeezed by clock or calendar as are a lower house and its committees. They are not as distracted by the urgencies of political and governmental problems.
Their memberships include, in each of Britain, Australia and Canada, he adds, a generous proportion of able men, some of whom
have had long executive and administrative
experience. Particularly in Britain and
Canada, but also in Australia to a considerable degree, there is in a second chamber committee the valuable element of continuity
which is often difficult to maintain in the
complexion of house committees.
[Hon. Mr. Martin.]

February 19, 1970

The question now arises whether a committee of the Canadian Senate could be as effective as that of the Australian House or the
British House of Lords. I think it could. Dr.
Kunz, whom we all know as a serious student
of the Canadian Senate, in his book The
Canadian Senate-A Reappraisal, has written
that "the Senate could develop some effective
and important means . of checking certain
executive practices, especially in the sphere
of delegated legislation."
Now, this chamber has from time to time,
on an ad hoc basis, reflected in the amendments it has proposed to Government legislation a particular concern for the vesting of
too much discretionary power in the executive through overly broad enabling legislation. Is this a valid contention? It is the kind
of matter we might well examine.
Honourable senators may wish to consider
these comments of mine and, after reflection,
determine if this is a study which we should
undertake. Is there a particular role for us
in the light of the experience of other
countries? In any event, the desire of the Government, the desire of Parliament and the
desire of the Canadian people is to make sure
that our laws are fully in keeping with the
philosophy behind our form of Government
in this frec society.
I commend this resolution to the Senate. I
hope that the Standing Senate Committee on
Legal and Constitutional Affairs will be able
to study this matter. If it does, I am sure we
will have ample occasion in the weeks ahead
to give full and competent consideration to
this matter.
Hon. Jacques Flynn: Honourable senators, I
wish to make only one comment at this time
on the speech of the Leader of the Government on this motion. I join with him in complimenting Senator Grattan O'Leary on his
birthday.
In respect of the motion, I reserve my comments except to say that I agree with it in
principle. I should now like to move the
adjournment of the debate.

LAND EXPROPRIATION BILL
SECOND READING-DEBATE CONTINUED

The Senate resumed from yesterday the
adjourned debate on the motion of Hon. Mr.
Urquhart for the second reading of Bill C-136,
respecting the Expropriation of Land.
Hon. Chesley W. Carter: Honourable senators, there is an old saying that fools rush in
where angels fear to tread. As a layman following the learned representations we have
heard from such erninent legal authorities as
Senator Urquhart and Senator Phillips
(Rigaud), I may be doing exactly that, particularly since I have not had the time to
study the bill and prepare my remarks as
thoroughly as I would wish.
Bill C-136 is a long and complicated bill,
with some 44 clauses and three schedules
covering 46 pages but Senator Urquhart gave
us such a clear exposé in his introduction of
this bill, even a layman such as myself can
understand its main provisions. I join with
those who have congratulated him on his
brilliant and concise presentation.
Both Senator Urquhart and Senator Phillips (Rigaud) have called attention to the fact
that this bill breaks new ground in that for
the first time recognition is given to the rights
of the ordinary citizen. It is this particular
feature that appeals to me as a layman, as I
am sure it will appeal to all ordinary citizens.
Not only is it an exercise in participatory
democracy, it is also an essential step towards
creating a just society. In fact, when one
comes to think of it, it is amazing that we
have permitted such arbitrary legislation as
the present law to remain on our statute
books for such a long time, a law that permits
the Crown to take a citizen's land without his
consent, sometimes even without his knowledge, and to deny him the cost of litigation if
he seeks redress through the courts; a law
that permits the Government to abandon this
land after expropriating it without any care
or thought for the inconvenience or financial
injury such action may have caused the
owner. Such a law not only makes a mockery

of democracy, it denies completely the importance of the individual which is the bedrock
principle on which our democracy and democratic institutions are founded. That kind of
law belongs to the totalitarian states, not to a
democractic society.
In matters such as land expropriation, the
ordinary citizen is at a tremendous disadvantage. It is a David-and-Goliath situation with
the all-powerful federal Governnent with its
strength, power, expertise and financial
resources ranged against the individual citizen. And, honourable senators, most citizens
are in the category we describe as "the little
man", who is therefore completely helpless
when it comes to protecting himself.
Bill C-136 goes a fairly long way to even up
the contest although it is in some respects
still heavily weighted in favour of Goliath.
No doubt further changes will be required in
the light of experience to achieve even greater equality for the individual citizen as
against the Crown.
The purpose of this bill is to permit land
expropriation to be exercised in such a way
that the Crown will be able to discharge its
two-fold duties of protecting the Canadian
taxpayer from being gouged and at the same
time ensuring that the party from whom the
land is being taken is treated with fairness
and justice. To accomplish this, the bill provides for a three-stage procedure as follows:
first, the pre-expropriation stage; secondly,
the negotiation stage; and thirdly, the litigation stage. I shall limit my remarks to the
first and third stages.
The pre-expropriation stage provides for a
public notice to be given of the Government's
intention to expropriate. As other senators
have pointed out, this in itself is a new
departure, because under the existing law no
notice at all is required. In clause 2 of the bill
there is a provision that this notice may be
sent to the individual concerned by registered
mail or by being published in a publication
that has general circulation in the area. The
purpose of giving notice is to permit objections to be raised either by the owner of the
property or by other interested parties. It is
essential, therefore, that public notice be
given by an advertisement in a publication.
However, subclause 2 of clause 2 seems to
require that this be done only if the address
of the owner is unknown.
If the owner has objections, clause 7 says
he must make these objections known to the
Minister of Public Works within 30 days. The
bill then provides for a public hearing as

SENATE DEBATES

outlined in clause 8. This public hearing is
ordered by the Minister of Public Works who
requests the Attorney General of Canada to
appoint a hearing officer. This hearing officer
is a very important official, and the only reference to his qualifications is the stipulation
that he must not be a civil servant. I would
have hoped, in view of his importance, that
the qualifications of the hearing officer would
have been defined in greater detail.
Such a public hearing could serve several
good purposes. It could provide an opportunity to examine the Crown's objective in expropriating the land which, in turn, would
expose how much thoughtful consideration
had been given by the Department of Public
Works to the necessity for taking the citizen's
land. This, in turn, would act as a check on
any hasty or sloppy work done by departmental officials. At the same time, it would ensure
that no more land would be expropriated
than necessity required. It would also provide
an opportunity for objections to be stated by
others who may be interested in the land
from a public viewpoint, for purposes of
recreation or conservation.
In any case, the Crown should be required
to make its case for expropriating one particular piece of land, as opposed to any alternative pieces that might be suggested, and to
explain in detail why it was needed and what
use would be made of it. However, to do that,
it would require the minister or his representative to be present at the hearing, as well as
the objectors; but I have not seen any provision in this bill which requires the minister
or his representative to be in attendance at
these hearings. In my opinion, without that
requirement the usefulness of the hearing
will be greatly impaired, and neither the
spirit of the legislation nor the intent of the
hearing will be fully realized.
In connection with the sending out of
notices-the notice of intent to expropriate,
the notice of public hearings-the bill does
not, in my opinion, make sufficient provision
for owners who may be ill or out of the
country at the time such notices are served.
With respect to litigation, the bill requires
this to be handled by the Exchequer Court of
Canada. Senator Pearson felt that it could be
handled more expeditiously and with less cost
to the litigant by the provincial, county or
district courts. When this bill was under
debate in the other place, many members
were of the same opinion as Senator Pearson.
Certainly, in line with the spirit of this act,
and as an example of participatory democra[Hon. Mr. Carter.]

February 19, 1970

cy, it seems reasonable to me that this bill
should at least provide the citizen with that
option.
It was argued that the Exchequer Court
was very slow in handling cases of this
nature, and that while it might be convenient
for Ontario and Quebec, it discriminated
against litigants in the Atlantic and western
provinces, in that it required the litigant to
employ counsel in Ottawa as well as in his
own province, which would add greatly to the
costs.
This was denied by the minister. He held
that district and county courts operated under
different rules, which varied somewhat from
one province to another, and would result in
a lack of uniformity in decisions, which
would eventually lead to appeals to the
Supreme Court of Canada, and in the end the
costs would likely be greater.
In favour of the Exchequer Court it was
held that land expropriation is a specialized
branch of law involving a wide variety of
complexities requiring a great deal of expertise, especially in the assessment of land
values. It would take the local courts several
years to build up the necessary body of jurisprudence, whereas it already exists in the
Exchequer Court, along with the necessary
experience and expertise to ensure uniform
decisions all across Canada, which, in itself, is
an essential part of justice.
With respect to the filing of statements of
claim, it was pointed out that the Exchequer
Court has already become decentralized to a
great extent, with registrars in almost every
province, and that further decentralization is
envisaged in legislation referred to in the
Speech from the ThroneHon. Mr. Martin: And shortly to be introduced in either of these houses.
Hon. Mr. Carter: Yes-which will be aimed
at streamlining the Exchequer Court to bring
it more in conformity with present-day needs.
With regard to court hearings, the Exchequer Court goes on circuit, and it would not be
necessary for a litigant in a western province
to have his case heard in Ottawa.
Not being a lawyer, I am not in a position
to assess the weight of these arguments, but
in relation to costs, as I understand it, Bill
C-136 provides that the citizen be reimbursed
for costs arising out of his objections and also
for costs incurred in litigation when he wins
his case and secures an award greater than
the Crown's offer. In addition, he is paid interest on the difference at the current rate of

-February 19, 1970

SENATE DEBATES

short-term treasury bills, and if the Crown's
offer does not exceed 90 per cent of the
court's award, he gets an extra 5 per cent
interest as a penalty bonus.
It is not likely that litigation will result
when only small amounts-say, less than $5,000-are involved. When large amounts are
involved-say, $100,000 or more-apart from
the rights it gives to individual citizens, this
bill may not provide any great advantage
over the old law. People with that kind of
money are usually able to take care of themselves. It is when medium amounts of money
are involved that the usefulness and efficacy
of this legislation is going to be put to the
test.
Take a case where the Crown wants a piece
of land which to the owner is worth, say,
$10,000. That is not a very large piece of land
by present-day values. A parcel of land of
this value would most likely belong to a citizen we would refer to as "the little man",
that is, one of that group of three million-plus
taxpayers with a taxable income of less than
$5,000. Suppose the Crown offers him $8,500.
A loss of $1,500 is too great for him to bear.
What will be his reaction? I would think that
his first thoughts would be: Is it worth while
trying to recover this $1,500 through the
courts? Would the expenses incurred use up
so much of it that the balance would not be
worth the effort? Would his chances of success be better in a local court than in the
Exchequer Court, even though it were on circuit and holding hearings in his province?
How long would he have to wait for a final
settlement?
My own opinion is that prevention is better
than cure; that there should be some machinery, or some code of evaluation, either in the
bill or appended to it as a schedule, that
would eliminate any significant gap between
what the Crown offered and what the land
was actually worth to the owner.
In cases where this machinery did not work
I should like to see some sort of a local appeal
board established that would attempt to
reconcile the amount offered with the amount
asked, so that there would be an intermediate step between the negotiation stage and
the litigation stage which would constitute a
last resort.
Of course, I am speaking as a layman, and
these suggestions may not be at al practical
from the legal point of view. However, when
this bill goes to committee I do hope that
every part of it will be carefully analyzed

from the point of view of its effect on citizens
whose circumstances are such as I have used
in my illustration.
Bill C-136 is not perfect. There will be
other amendments to improve it as time goes
on. But, in its present form it represents a
giant leap forward in humanizing the present
law and treating persons as human beings
with rights instead of non-persons, as the present law does. Therefore, I give it my complete support.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: Honourable senators, I
should say, in all fairness, that Senator Carter
has delivered a very relevant speech today. I
move the adjournment of the debate.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Flynn, debate
adjourned.
CRIMINAL CODE
PUNISHMENT FOR THEFT-BILL TO AMENDSECOND READING-DEBATE ADJOURNED

Hon. John M. Macdonald moved the second
reading of Bill S-21, to amend the Criminal
Code.
He said: Honourable senators, it is not my
intention to speak at any length on this bill.
Indeed, I think a short explanation is all that
is called for as the provisions are almost
self-explanatory.
The whole principle of the bill is contained
in clause 1, which provides that section 280 of
the Criminal Code be amended. The other
provisions follow as a consequence of the
amendment of section 280.
Section 280 of the Criminal Code was
enacted in 1954, and it reads as follows:
Except where otherwise prescribed by
law, every one who commits theft is
guilty of an indictable offence and is
liable
(a) to imprisonment for ten years,
where the property stolen is a testamentary instrument or where the value
of what is stolen exceeds fifty dollars,
or
(b) to imprisonment for two years,
where the value of what is stolen does
not exceed fifty dollars.
It can be seen that the only change which is
proposed by the bill now before us is to move
the dividing line, as it were, between a minor

SENATE DEBATES
and a major theft, from $50 to $200. Before
the 1954 enactment there were various penalties provided for the theft of different articles. It was to eliminate these variations that
a general penalty was provided in 1954 by
section 280, and by making a distinction, as it
were, between major and minor thefts a new
principle of law was not being introduced.
Such a distinction was in existence before
1954 and, I expect, for a long time before that
year.
For example, a magistrate had a wider
jurisdiction in theft cases when the value of
the article stolen did not exceed $25, and
there was an additional penalty provided
when the valuation exceeded $200.
Honourable senators, I do not know why
the dividing line between what might be classified as minor and major cases of theft was
set at $50. It may very well be that due to the
greater purchasing power of the dollar in
1954, something worth $50 was regarded as
being expensive and valuable, and the theft
of it was not only a heavy loss to the owner
but a serious offence against society which
merited severe punishment. In any event,
whatever the reason was, I do not think this
heavier penalty for theft of something worth
over $50 can be justified today. I do not think
it can be justified for two reasons.
In the first place, values have changed since
1954. The purchasing power of the dollar has
decreased. Inflation has had a tremendous
effect. The result is that the heavier and more
severe penalty provided for theft when the
value of that stolen is over $50 is now the
penalty when the real value is considerably
less. In other words, economic forces have
changed this law and not the Parliament of
Canada, and I believe this to be wholly
wrong. If the penalty for theft, or for any
other offence, is to be changed, then let it be
changed by Parliament and not by the cold,
inhuman, and ruthless action of economic
forces.
Honourable senators, in proposing this
change in the dividing line between the
penalties for various kinds of theft, I have
made no attempt to bring the $50 valuation in
line with the present purchasing power of the
dollar. Probably the exact change could be
ascertained from the Dominion Bureau of
Statistics, but I do not think that knowing it
would serve any useful purpose. It may be
[Hon. Mr. Macdonald

(Cape Breton).]

February 19, 1970

that a valuation of $75 would be equal to the
1954 value of $50, but even if that be so I still
think the dividing line should be at $200. This
brings me to the second reason for wanting
this change.
I do believe that since 1954 the attitude of
society towards offences of theft without violence has changed. I do not claim to be able
to prove this, but I do think that a study of
the penalties handed down by the courts
would confirm it. Indeed, our whole attitude
towards punishment for crime has changed
over the years. While I have left in Bill S-21
a distinction between the penalties for major
and minor theft, I have also raised the dividing line between them. I must confess that the
figure of $200 is an arbitrary one, the advancing of which I can give no good reason. It
may well be that a higher figure should be
substituted. I do advance this figure as at
least a starting point, but I would be quite
willing to accept a higher one if honourable
senators feel the substitution should be made.
The amendments contained in clauses 2, 3,
4 and 5 of Bill S-21 are consequential on the
amendments to section 280 of the Criminal
Code. I will not discuss them now unless
there are questions you would like to ask
about them.
I feel that the amendments proposed by Bill
S-21 are worthy ones and I recommend this
bill to your favourable consideration.
Hon. Mr. McDonald: May I ask a question
of the honourable senator? I missed the latter
part of his remarks because I was in consultation with the Leader of the Government. Is it
his intention to send this bill to committee if
it receives second reading?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I believe that is
desirable. I propose that it be sent to the
Standing Senate Committee on Legal and
Constitutional Affairs.
Hon. Mr. Martin: Senator McDonald knew
it had to go to committee, but his regard for
Senator Macdonald is such that he approached
it indirectly.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I must thank the
honourable leader for his remarks.

nent counsel. From 1903, when he was 25
years of age, he was for three years the city
prosecutor of Vancouver, and his pay was $75
a month. Leaving that work, he embarked
upon a private law practice and became what
is known as a labour lawyer and a defence
lawyer in criminal matters. In other words,
Senator Farris devoted his talents to the
underprivileged and to the 1ow-income
groups. His practice was interrupted, as the
leader has said, by an attraction to public life
in the Province of British Columbia. On three
occasions, in 1907, 1909 and 1912, he sought
election, and each time was defeated, but he
was elected at the age of 38 in 1916. For six
years he was the Attorney General of British
Columbia in the government of the Honourable John Oliver. Senator Farris was responsible in those early years of this century for
the sponsorship of much social legislation, the
Testators Family Maintenance Act, the
Family Compensation Act, the Hours of Work
Act, the Mothers Pensions Act and other similar legislation.
After six years in public life he resumed
his legal career in 1922, when he was 44 years
of age. For the rest of his life he was always
primarily a lawyer. He had long experience
before the highest courts of this land and
only a few years ago he was still pleading
cases before the Supreme Court of Canada.
He appeared many times before the Privy
Council, before our appeals to that eminent
board were abolished. His first case in the
Privy Council was in 1919, when he was the
Attorney General of British Columbia. The
case was the Attorney General for Canada vs.
Ritchie. This was his first victory before the
Privy Coundil. It is interesting to reflect that
on that occasion his opponent was Sir John
Simon and his junior was Jeffrey Lawrence,
later Lord Oaksey, one of the judges who
presided over the Nuremberg trials.
Thirty years later, in 1949, with his son
John as his junior-a fact which I am sure
gave him great pleasure and pride-Senator
Farris was again before the Privy Council.
Sir John Simon was now Lord Simon and
presided over the case, and Lord Oaksey was
a member of the Judicial Committee. His last
case in the Privy Coundil was heard in 1951.
On that occasion he appeared in two cases,
one for British Columbia Electric, and in the
following case for the Boilermakers' Union.
As the Leader of the Government bas said,
Senator Farris was a great constitutional
lawyer, and in a 32-year period appeared in
most of the constitutional cases from Canada

to the Privy Council. He represented British
Columbia in cases before the Judicial Committee on the Bennett New Deal legislation in
the 'thirties.
He regarded as his greatest triumph the
Esquimalt and Nanaimo Railway case in 1949.
This established the constitutionality of British Columbia's right to tax the timberlands
held by the Canadian Pacific Railway. This
victory meant millions of dollars to the people
of British Columbia, and it is noteworthy in
the fact that he was successful before the
Privy Council in having a unanimous judgment of the Supreme Court of Canada
reversed. His achievement was described as a
case of magnificent advocacy.
Like Sir Lyman Duff, Senator Farris was
noted in the legal profession for his great
courtesy to young lawyers whom he helped
and encouraged on every occasion. As the
Leader of the Government said, he was appointed to the Senate of Canada in 1937, at
59 years of age. That was a memorable year
for him, because in that year he was also
President of the Canadian Bar Association.
I think no discussion of our late colleague
would be meaningful unless it recognized the
great importance that his wonderful wife
exerted upon him. They were a very happy
couple. His wife was the daughter of a
university professor, and had taught school
for a number of years before her marriage.
She was the first woman member of the
Senate of the University of British Columbia,
and the first woman member of the Board of
Governors of that university, and for many
years was secretary of the board. The important thing about the Farris connection with
the university is that together husband and
wife prevailed upon John Oliver, the then
premier, to provide funds to establish the new
site for the university on the magnificent
Point Grey, so familiar to many honourable
senators.
I remember when the bill was introduced to
Parliament in which it was proposed that
Canada should abolish appeals to the Privy
Council. The bill was proposed by the party
Senator Farris supported. But, here he
showed his independence by opposing the
measure and its principle because he thought
so highly of the court. I remember, too,
another occasion when there was a constitutional issue before the Senate. It was the
second time that particular issue had arisen,
after a number of years had intervened. In
the first debate Senator Farris gave an opin-

SENATE DEBATES
ion; he also gave his opinion in the second
debate. Senator Lambert, who was a great
admirer of Senator Farris, with some trepidation decided that in his own lay mind Senator
Farris had given one opinion on the first
occasion and a different one on the second
occasion. He charged him witli this position,
expecting to draw some fire. Senator Lambert
was completely disarmed because after he
said this Senator Farris rose in his place and
said, "Which opinion did my honourable
friend like best?"
Senator Farris, who was my room-mate,
but not for long, loved this chamber and its
work. His powers were very great. Senator
Martin has referred to the speeches that lie
made over the years. I remember sitting in
the gallery and hearing him make speeches,
particularly during the war when I was with
the Honourable Angus Macdonald at the
Navy. I do not believe there was anyone in
this chamber who commanded the respect
this man commanded. I feel privileged to
have been a member of this chamber with
him, although I have not been here as long as
Senator Hayden, Senator Aseltine and a few
others who were here when Senator Farris
was at the height of his powers. As the leader
has said, he was a senator for 33 years.
Honourable senators, we shall not soon see
his equal here again.
Hon. G. Percival Burchill: Honourable
senators, I should like very briefly to add my
tribute to those already paid to my friend and
colleague, Senator Farris.
The Farris family was very prominent in
the Province of New Brunswick in days gone
by. Senator Farris' father, the Honourable L.
P. Farris, was Chief Commissioner of Agriculture, as it was styled in those days. Today he
would be called the Minister of Agriculture.
He was in the administration in New Brunswick of the Honourable H. R. Emerson and
the Honourable L. J. Tweedie. At that time
my father was the Speaker of the Legislature,
thus a great friendship grew up between the
Farris family and ours which dates back to
those days.
The late senator graduated from Acadia
University and the University of Pennsylvania. His early education was taken at an
institution in St. Martin's, which long ago
passed out of existence.
The senator headed west to seek his fortune. He was accompanied by a man from
Bathurst, New Brunswick, by the name of
Alphonse Turgeon. Their destination was
[Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West).]

March 3, 1970

Regina. Turgeon went to Prince Albert. Farris' intention was to go to Battleford, but
circumstances changed and he was enticed to
go to the coast, to Vancouver where, as Senator Connolly said, he started in a very small
and meagre way. Senator Farris often told me
about the difficult times lie had at first, but
eventually he built up an enormous practice.
The point I want to make is that the next
time Farris and Turgeon met, one was attorney general of his adopted province of British
Columbia and the other was attorney general
of his adopted province of Saskatchewan. We
all know that Turgeon became Chief Justice
of Saskatchewan and later Ambassador to
Ireland.
Therefore, I am grateful tonight for this
opportunity, while paying tribute to Senator
Farris, a distinguished son of New Brunswick,
to link with him the name of another distinguished son of New Brunswick, Chief Justice
Alphonse Turgeon.
Honourable senators, I do not intend to say
more. Senator Connolly, Senator Martin and
the Leader of the Opposition have given us
an outline of the career of our late colleague
in this house. To me, his speeches were powerful, brilliant and able. I remember very vividly the speech to which Senator Connolly
referred, when Senator Farris attacked the
legislation to terminate appeals to the Privy
Council and to make the Supreme Court of
Canada the final court. I also remember the
speech of Senator Hugessen, made on the
same occasion, when Senator Hugessen
favoured the legislation. Those were two very
able speeches.
As Senator Connolly has said, Senator
Farris appeared in many cases before the
Supreme Court of Canada. He was also well
known and recognized as an able counsel in
England on those occasions when he appeared
on behalf of clients before the Privy Council.
Senator Farris was a very distinguished son
of New Brunswick and one of Canada's greatest lawyers. When we both lived at the
Chateau in Ottawa, we were indebted to the
Farrises for their many acts of kindness and
hospitality. So, my wife joins with me in
extending to Mrs. Farris and the family our
deep sympathy in their loss.
Hon. John J. Kinley: Honourable senators,
we have listened with interest to the
impressive tribute paid to our late colleague
Senator Farris by the leaders of the chamber
and by eloquent friends, Senator Connolly
and his fellow New Brunswicker townsman
Senator Burchill.

March 3, 1970

SENATE DEBATES

With the death of Senator Farris, it appears
that I am the oldest active senator in the
chamber at present.
Hon. Mr. Smith: For some time to come.
Hon. Mr. Kinley: To say anything more
than what has been said, out of respect for
Senator Farris would be like painting the lily,
but because of my long association with and
my esteem for him, I would like to make a
personal tribute on this occasion.
Honourable senators, you have heard many
kind things said about Senator Farris. I do
not think I ever heard more said about a man
in his presence than we have heard about
him tonight. He deserved them all, and we of
the Maritimes are proud to hear them said,
because we believe he was a great Canadian.
There have been many able men in the
Senate in the past, but among them Senator
Farris was a giant. Always outspoken in his
opinion, there was never any question which
side he was on in any debate. He was an
orator of the old school.
Senator Farris will long be remembered
here and in British Columbia for his public
service through his representations in Parliament and in the legal profession. He was a
composite of many good qualities: a fine-looking man, physically fit, and of a fine intellect.
The truism that with age comes wisdom
and, with long life understanding, certainly
applied to Senator Farris, who was in this
chamber the exemplar of both those qualities.
And we who are growing old may well take
courage from that shining example in realizing that we can be of some use to our country, even if this is the day of the youth and
we must look upon the coming generations to
bear the burden of this country's efforts.
Distinguished as he was in the legislature
of British Columbia, Senator Farris was of
even greater service to the Senate of Canada.
I think he would have agreed that there is no
better place to learn than in a local legislature, where the members are close to the
people and thus know more about the grass
roots of politics.
There were few times in our long association that Senator Farris and I had differences
of opinion. One was occasioned by a conversation we had with respect to the second vote
in British Columbia. He thought that was a
great achievement. I differed with him there,
because I felt that you cannot hold two principles at the same time, and that is what is

involved in the second vote. I believe he finally came to agree with me on that question.
Another occasion of difference of opinion was
the change from the designation of Dominion
Day to Canada Day. Being a bit of an imperialist he did not like that change, and being
solid in his opinions be did not hesitate to say
so. However, it is a tribute to Senator Farris's
attitude toward his colleagues that, although I
disagreed with him quite strongly, it never
affected our relationship.
I wish to join with other senators in
expressing our sincere sympathy to the
family of Senator Farris. Although his passing inevitably brings sorrow to them, nevertheless there should be some admixture of joy
in that he had such a long and distinguished
life. He was a man of wisdom, a man of
action and a man of opportunity; like all
great men he undoubtedly took great risks,
and the greatness of his achievements was
ample justification.

SENATE DEBATES

He said: Honourable senators, I should
point out that in the Trust Companies Act in
its present form a trust company is permitted
to invest in or lend on mortgages on real
estate in Canada and securities issued by
Canadian corporations where those securities
meet certain quality tests.
Under Bill S-8 it was proposed to give
authority to federally-incorporated trust companies to do business outside Canada should
they so desire, and the proposed section 68A,
which is the subject of the amendments
which have just been read, would enable
them to invest in or lend on securities issued
by corporations in any country in which they
are doing business, provided that the securities meet the same quality tests as those
which apply to such investments in Canada.
There was the proposal in sections 64 and
68 that would enable a trust company in the
same way to invest in or lend on mortgages
on real estate in any country outside Canada
where the trust company is doing business.
Subsection 2 of section 68A of the bill when
it was before us specified that a company
must at all times retain in Canada assets
equal to its liabilities and its guaranteed trust
money received in Canada, and that foreign
corporate securities or foreign mortgages
would not be acceptable for that purpose.
When the bill was before the other place
there was concern that no maximum limit
was provided on the amount that might be
invested in securities or mortgages outside
Canada. Therefore, these amendments which
have just been read were incorporated. They
provide three tests, and the limit is the greatest of any one of the three tests. May I repeat
them.
The limit of investment in securities or
mortgages outside Canada by a trust company
that must be doing business outside of
Canada is the largest of: (a) 10 per cent of the
capital and surplus funds; (b) a proportion of
the capital and surplus funds equal to the
ratio of obligations outside Canada to the
total obligations; and (c) such amount as is
required to be invested in foreign jurisdictions pursuant to the laws of those jurisdictions, but subject in this case to the concurrence of the Superintendent of Insurance.
The effect of the amendments is to put
a limit on the amount of investment in
securities or mortgages that may be made by
a trust company where it is carrying on business outside Canada.

The comment I would like to add in connection with this is that at the end of December 1968 federally-incorporated trust companies had total capital, reserves and surplus
amounting to $107 million. The total amount
of funds received and held in the guaranteed
trust funds amounted to $1,394 million. Since
the Superintendent of Insurance feels it is
unlikely that the volume of foreign business
will ever amount to as much as 10 per cent of
the total, the practical effect of the amendment is to put a maximum limit of about $10
million on the investment by trust companies
in foreign corporate securities and foreign
mortgages under the permissible clauses in
this bill.
The view of the Superintendent of Insurance is that in practice he does not expect
that all the companies will be interested in
foreign business, and those that are will not
likely do more than a very small portion of
their business outside Canada. For that
reason he has no objection to the limitation
which was made, and there would appear to
be some sense in making that limitation.
Hon. Jacques Flynn: Honourable senators,
the explanation given by Senator Hayden
sounds convincing; on the other hand, it is a
rather complex problem. In order to give all
members of the Senate an opportunity to read
the amendments and the explanation of Senator Hayden in Hansard tomorrow, I move the

provision of this limiting amendment in relation to securities is not an onerous one and is
perhaps an excess of caution. This is illustrated by the fact that although loan companies
already have the power to invest in mortgages in every country in which they are
doing business, no such company so far has
begun to do business outside Canada.

SENATE DEBATES

This bill has much to recommend it, honourable senators, and I am loth to find fault
with it. However, my negative criticisms are
few in number and may be due to misinterpretation on my part. I would invite the sponsor of the bill to correct me if I am wrong in
singling out in this bill what appears to me to
be some defects.
The first shortcoming, in my view, bas to do
with the cost of asserting objections in that
same public hearing about which I was speaking. According to subsection 9 of Section 8,
the hearing officer would be empowered to:
-fix such amount, if any, as he deems
reasonable, not exceeding such maximum
amount as may be authorized by any
tariff of costs prescribed by the Governor
in Council for the purpose of this
sectionAs I see it, the Government is saying: "We
think that it is very broadminded of us to not
only permit you to disagree with us but to
offer to pay your expenses; the least you can
do is submit to our imposition of a few rules
as to how and to what extent you may defend
yourself." It would have been preferable, in
my mind, for the authors of this bill to assure
us that the tariff of costs would be munificent
enough to cover all possible legal and expertise costs that a plaintiff may have incurred
or may have to incur in presenting his case.
Since the Government is the one initiating
the action of expropriation, which results in
these expenses being incurred by the expropriated party wishing to contest the expropriation, the benefit of the doubt should also
be given to the plaintiff, and unless his action
can be proven to be completely futile or
taken in bad faith, all costs should be paid.
Senator Urquhart, in explaining the bill,
said:
The claimant will be entitled as of
right to have the whole of his costs paid
by the Government where the amount
awarded to him by the court exceeds the
amount of compensation offered to him
by the Government, and in any other
case the awarding of court costs will be
at the discretion of the court.
This is not quite as rosy a picture as it
might at first glance have appeared to be. The
expropriated party who proceeds against the
Government in good faith could end up being
punished quite severely for having been
wrong, and he may have been wrong in good
faith.
21498-39j

The third problem I can see has to do with
financial considerations. The bill admittedly
states that an offer of full compensation has
to be made within 90 days of the notice of
confirmation. However, I can see nothing that
would indicate how soon payment would be
made, were the offer to be accepted. It is all
well and good to say that a man can accept
the offer without prejudice and take his case
to the Exchequer Court, but unless payment
is forthcoming immediately upon the offer
being accepted to the extent it is made, the
man may not have the funds to retain a
lawyer to look after his case or to advance
the funds to the experts which he has to hire.
Even if the expropriated party were satisfied with the offer and did not intend to
proceed against the Crown, a provision should
be written into the bill to ensure that he wil
be paid immediately. The reason is quite simple-a man whose home or business establishment has been expropriated will have to find
another; a farmer whose field bas been
expropriated will have to purchase another
piece of land elsewhere. The purchase of
property requires cash-if not the complete
amount, to be in a position to drive a better
bargain. He certainly must have enough for
the down payment.
The fourth point I should like to raise is in
favour of the expropriating party-surprisingly enough, the Crown or one of its
agencies.
The bill states that from the time of the
notice of confirmation, the expropriating
party has 90 days within which to offer an
amount estimated to be full compensation.
There are circumstances in which this delay
would certainly not be sufficient for the
Crown. Consider, for example, if the Crown
decided to expropriate lands in downtown
Montreal, land on which there were three or
four large office buildings, all fully occupied.
Three months would surely not be time
enough to figure out adequate compensation
for everyone with an interest.
Consequently, I feel that provision should
have been made in the bill for a court to
grant extensions to the expropriating party to
this 90-day delay when the circumstances
warrant such extension. I may say that I have
had this expression of opinion from persons
who have had some experience with expropriations made by the federal Government.
In closing, I say that in essence this is a
good bill. It affords the individual a much
greater degree of protection against the arbi-

trary power of government. It forces the state
to act in a much less capricious and despotic
fashion. Any improvement along these lines is
welcome in this era, but I suggest that there
may be further improvements to the bill
when it comes before a committee. I hope
that the comments I have made will be considered there.
Hon. John J. Connolly: May I ask the
honourable gentleman a question? As I understand your third point, it is that on the occasion of expropriation, the expropriated party
is made an offer by the expropriating authority and the proposal is that the amount of the
offer should be paid forthwith.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: Yes, that he should be
allowed to accept this offer without prejudice

Court.

Hon. Mr. Flynn: I accept the interpretation,
but the situation is not entirely clear. When
you accept an off er usually it is because you

Hon. Mr. Urquhart: That is not so in this
case.
Hon. Lionel Choquette: I submit in this
case, with all due respect, that when the word
"accept" is used it means that the parties
have agreed that a fair off er has been made
and has been accepted, the amount offered is
to be paid forthwith, and that is the end of
the case. However, if the offer is turned down
and a cheque is accepted, it is considered to
be payment on account and the parties continue with their application. But the word
"accept" there, as interpreted by the honourable senator, would mean that both parties
agree on the amount offered.

SENATE DEBATES
mentary Income Tax Agreement between
Canada and Sweden.
He said: Honourable senators, the title of
Bill C-156 indicates its purpose. It is a supplementary amendment to a previously arranged
agreement between Sweden and Canada with
respect to income tax and the avoidance of
double tax action. The original agreement
was implemented in 1951. Most parliamentarians will be familiar with this type of
legislation owing to the fact that we have
agreements of the same nature with approximately 15 other countries.
The sole purpose of the new supplementary
agreement is to change Article IX, the article
dealing with the tax treatment of government
remuneration. The request for this change
came largely from the Province of Ontario
because there were certain affected provincial
officials who would have been subject to
double taxation were it not for the agreement
reached last October between the officials of
Sweden and Canada. The amended Article IX
provides an exemption from Swedish income
tax in respect of remuneration paid by a
Canadian province to a provincial public
servant for services he renders to the province while ho is resident in Swedcn.
The supplementary agreement provides, as
a measure of reciprocity, because Sweden is
not a federal system like ours, that a similar
exemption will be piven by Canada for remuneration paid to officials of political subdivisions of Sweden. That would mean, for example, representatives of a Swedish city who are
resident in Canada serving their local
government in Sweden. The existing agreement provides a reciprocal exemption with
respect te officials of national governments,
not orovincial or local officials, and that is the
purpose, largely, of the amendment before us
tonight.
The amendment set out in the supplementary agreement would bring the main agreement on this matter into line with the terms
of most of Canada's other income tax agreements-and I mentioned that we had perhaps
15 of those-which contain an exemption for
remuneration of provincial officials and, in
some cases, for remuneration of officials of
local authorities.
For Canada, the main effect of the new
agreement will be to give tax relief to officials
of provincial governments who are posted to
Sweden by their provinces. In particular, it
will help in the kind of case where a provincial official is resident in Sweden but is taxable by Canada because of our section 139 of

[Hon.

Mr. Benidickson.]

March 3. 1970

the Income Tax Act. That section provides that
a person shall be deemed to have been resident
in Canada throughout a taxation year if he is
the servant of a province and was resident in
Canada immediately prior to appointment or
employment by a province.
Without the protection of the supplementary agreement, both the salary and the
allowances of such officials would be subject
to Swedish income taxes, which are generally
higher than Canadian; this would have the
result either that officials serving abroad
would get less take-home pay than if they
were serving in Canada, or that it would be
necessary for them to be given substantially
higher salaries and allowances.
The supplementary agreement is to come
into force after it has received legislative
approval in Sweden and in Canada. I mentioned that it was negotiated by officials last
October, but it requires legislative authority
on both sides. I am informed that approval
has already been obtained by the Swedish
Riksdag, and all that remains is approval by
this Parliament and exchange of instruments
of ratification by the two governments. The
agreement is shown in the appendix to the
bill. If we approve the bill we approve the
schedule, and in the schedule it is indicated
that the exemption on the part of these provincial employees would be effective from
January 1, 1968.
Hon. Allister Grosari: Honourable senators,
on the face of it this is a very simple bill
which need not take up much time of the
Senate. However, I should like to make one or
two comments about it. In the first place, we
have before us a bill the purpose of which is
to implement an agreement with another
country. It is not called a treaty here but the
authorities make it quite clear that there is
not much distinction to be made between
what are called treaties and what are called
agreements.
This raises the interesting question of the
lectures we have had from time to time from
the Leader of the Government (Hon. Mr.
Martin)-very good lectures they have beento the effect that the Crown's prerogative,
which is now exercised by the cabinet, is
absolute. Of course it is not. I think this bill is
one of many indications we have that that
anachronistic theory has no real relevance to
the Canadian situation today. We have here
an agreement ratified in the normal way
between two governments. It is ineffective in
Canada until a bill such as this comes before

March 3, 1970

SENATE DEBATES

us to bring it within the ambit of the Income
Tax Act and income tax laws. The honourable Leader of the Government shakes his
head. If he will say to me that I am wrong, he
will perhaps then explain to me why it is
necessary to have this bill. Perhaps the
honourable senator will discuss this when I
am finished.
It is not an important point, but I should
like to see us get away from this idea, this
relic of the past, that the Government of
Canada bas the right to bind Canadian citizens willy-nilly by merely making a treaty or
an agreement with another country.
Secondly, I should draw attention to the use
of the expression "political subdivision"
which occurs in several places in the bill. I
have serious doubts whether this is a proper
description of a province of Canada. I very
much doubt that the provinces would accept
this description of themselves as political subdivisions. The British North America Act
would seem to make it very clear that the
two jurisdictions, each within the area of its
competence, are equal, and that the provinces
are not, as the bill states, merely political
subdivisions of Canada. I am sure my own
leader on this side would agree with me.
The bill also deals with the avoidance of
double taxation and, as the sponsor has
pointed out so clearly, the purpose here is to
deal with a very small situation, one that
involves an employee of the Government of
Ontario in receipt of income which, without
the supplement to the agreement, would
have made him liable to double taxation. For
this single individual it is required that a
bill go through Parliament.
Honourable senators will immediately
recall a certain paper called the White Paper
-one
of many white papers but this is a
White Paper to end all white papers-the
White Paper on Taxation. It is interesting that
this White Paper contemplates situations in
which it is necessary for tax relief to be
given for agreements or treaties to be made
with far more than the 15 countries now
covered by double taxation agreements. This
brings to our attention the fact that this
White Paper, which is not the subject of
debate here but which is germane to this
particular bill, now proposes substantial
changes in our taxation laws which are going
to require a fantastic number of bills such as
this, not only to bring in the countries not
presently covered by agreements on double

taxation but also perhaps many individual
cases such as this one. It is one example of
the many absurdities in that paper.
Honourable senators, I close on a happier
note. I note that the signature on the supplementary agreement is that of B. Margaret
Meagher, which any
Irishman
would
automatically pronounce "Ma-ar". Those of
us who were on the Science Policy Committee
had the great privilege of meeting our
Ambassador, Miss Meagher, in Stockholm
when we were there last year. At that time I
discovered that she is a descendent of a great
Irish rebel known as Meagher of the Sword
who stood with D'Arcy McGee at the start of
the rebellion of 1848 and who later went to
the United States, commanded an Irish
brigade in the American Civil War on the
side of the north, and became deputy governor of Colorado where there is still to be
seen a statue erected to the memory of
"Meagher of the Sword". He is a direct
ancestor of our distinguished ambassador,
the signatory to this supplementary agreement.
Hon. Mr. Martin: Fighting to uphold the
royal prerogative.
Hon. Mr. Pearson: May I ask the honourable sponsor a question. I see in the bill that
the date is given as 1968 and I wonder why
this is being made retroactive?
Hon. Mr. Benidickson: The reason is simply
this: we are legislatively approving this
retroactive aspect of it because it was part of
the negotiations that took place between the
Swedish and Canadian officials last October.
If you accept the bill, you accept the schedule
which in turn has reference to that date.

INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT
RESEARCH CENTRE BILL
SECOND READING-DEBATE ADJOURNED

Hon. Paul Martin moved the second reading of Bill C-12, to establish the International
Development Research Centre.
He said: Honourable senators, in moving
the second reading of this bill I recall that
twenty years ago Canada acknowledged its
responsibility to the developing countries of
the world. My judgment is that since then we
have striven to fulfil these responsibilities to
the best of our ability. Through the Colombo
Plan and subsequent arrangements we gave
assistance to a number of programs to which,
hopefully, we made meaningful contributions.
21498-40

Ten years ago the External Aid Office, as it
was then known, was established to broaden,
intensify and co-ordinate our external aid
policies and programs. As honourable senators know, that office bas been renamed the
Canadian International Development Agency.
This designation was applied in 1969. The
idea of a Canadian-sponsored international
development research centre was first
brought to my attention about three years
ago, by the present director, Mr. Maurice
Strong. I mention this only because I have
been associated with it and because I have,
with others, devoted an appreciable amount
of time to its conception. I felt that the idea
was a good one and, as the then Secretary of
State for External Affairs, I did what I could
to encourage my colleagues in the Government
to support the idea. It was felt that it would
be desirable for Canada to take the initiative
in establishing a special program of research
and development in relation to problems of
international economic and social development, taking into account its importance to
our country generally and our role in external aid.
Undoubtedly the centennial year and the
flurry that accompanied it had something to
do with the idea, for we did through the Expo
concept promote Canadian know-how and
artistic talent which provided the spark that
in turn generated many new ideas in this
country. Suggestions poured forth that
Canada should establish a world university,
an international centre of knowledge, an
institute for the advancement of man, an
international centre concerned with the problems of the less fortunate nations of the
world. Something was destined to emerge
from these suggestions as our unique contribution to mankind in that very special year.
By the late spring of 1967 the concept of an
international centre had evolved to the point
where the then Prime Minister, Mr. Pearson,
conveyed the idea publicly in a speech at
Carleton University on June 8. He said in
part:
If free civilization is to survive and
grow, we must very soon find vastly
improved methods for extending the
benefits of modern existence to the whole
world community of man... One idea for

a new Canadian initiative in meeting this
challenge that should be considered, is
for the establishment of a Centre for
International Development... Perhaps it
will now prove possible for us to add a
new dimension to our modest role in

SENATE DEBATES
the world community by providing for a
sharpened focus on the challenge of
international development facing every
country.
Now the present Government presents to
the Senate a bill proposing the creation of the
International Development Research Centre.
This bill was unanimously passed in the other
place, and it is now our opportunity to guide
it, if we will, in its final stages, and to provide the centre with its own mandate, that is
to say, to pursue the objectives Canada has
set for it. In the main, they are:
-to
initiate, encourage, support and
conduct research into the problems of the
regions of the world and into the means
for applying and adapting scientific, technical and other knowledge to the economic and social advancement of those
regions, and, in carrying out those objects
(a) to enlist the talents of natural and
social scientists and technologists of
Canada and other countries;
(b) to assist the developing regions to
build up the research capabilities, the
innovative skills and the institutions
required to solve their problems;
(c) to encourage generally the co-ordination of international development
research; and
(d) to foster co-operation in research on
development problems between the
developed and developing regions for
their mutual benefit.
Honourable senators will note that section 4
of the bill sets out the objects and powers of
the centre. Subsection 2 of that section outlines the powers of the centre, designed to
give effect to these objects. The nature of
these powers describes the purpose and
character of the centre.
There has been a great deal of careful
planning and negotiating, conducted under
the direction of the President of the Canadian
International Development Agency, acting on
behalf of the Government. It is now our
opportunity to give final assent to this bill, if
we are so disposed, to ensure that the goals
proposed for this new Canadian venture are
achieved through a dynamic and bold concept
dedicated to real improvement and progress
in the field of international development.
The potential aspect and impact of this
proposed centre could be far reaching. It
could revolutionize the established patterns of
[Hon. Mr. Martin.]

March 4, 1970

development. By providing for a self-help and
multi-disciplinary approach to problem-solving, it will be possible for this centre to open
avenues which will add new dimensions to
our traditional development procedures.
A great deal of the technology of today is
being produced as a by-product of the space
race and the nuclear arms race, in neither of
which Canada is playing a leading role. There
is increasing recognition, however,. that insufficient attention or priority is being given to
the application of the latest technology and
techniques to the problems of man's economic
and social development. I believe that this is
an area in which Canada is uniquely qualified
to make a contribution.
As the Government sees it, there is need
today for new international and inter-disciplinary institutions for relating the latest technology and techniques to the problems of
international development. No single institution has yet been established as the internationally recognized focal point for meeting
this need. There are institutes with limited
objectives in the United Kingdom. There is
one at McGill University under Professor
Breecher, but these are not as comprehensive
in their scope as what is intended by this bill.
The preliminary investigations indicate, I
believe, that there is strong support for this
idea among leaders in the international community, not only in the developed but in the
developing nations. This bill offers an appropriate opportunity for a useful Canadian
initiative. This initiative will receive strong
support, I believe, from the World Bank,
UNESCO, the International Monetary Fund,
the Asian Development Bank, the InterAmerican Development Bank and the OECD.
The Centre for International Development
should attract the most eminent and competent people in the fields with which it is
concerned, not only from Canada but from all
parts of the world. I believe that this will be
accepted by the Canadian university community as a useful and desirable complement
to their own role in the field of international
studies, rather than as a competitor.
As is revealed in the Report of the World
Bank Commission on International Development, "Partners in Development", under the
chairmanship of the former Prime Minister,
the Right Honourable Lester Pearson, the
developing countries are going through a
period of self-analysis and therefore could be
receptive to Canada's newest contribution to
international development.

March 4. 1970

DEBATES
Marc 4. 970SENATE

That commission observed:
-aid suppliers should devote a significant share of their research and development resources and fadilities to projects
specifically related to problems of developing countries.
The Commission argues th.at by 1972 such
expenditures should reach 5 per cent of all
public expenditures for the industrialized
countries for research and development, of
which at least haif should be put to work i
the developing countries. The United Nations
Advisory Comnmittee on the Application of
Science and Technology goes even further. It
proposes that donors be asked to allocate 10
per cent of their research and development
resources to projects of concern to lower
income countries, and an additional 5 per cent
to help create an institutional infrastructure
for science and technology in these countries.
I believe that Canada is fortunate, that we
are in an enviable position to sponsor the
creation of such a centre. We have charted a
course in international pathways which has
been accepted and respected by most nations.
In doing this we have retained the confidence
of both the emerging and the developed
nations of the world. The establishment of the
International Development Research Centre
can therefore be viewed from. the outside as
our pledge to the betterment of humanity, in
this inter-dependent world where the standards of living over '75 per cent of the people
are far below that of the countries in the
developed parts of the world.
The funds required to finance the centre's
operation and programns will come out of
Canada's international development allocation. My colleague the Secretary of State for
External Affairs envisages the allocation of as
much as 5 per cent of our total development
aid funds to the centre. The Government is
prepared to allocate not less than $30 million
for the administration and programs of the
centre over the first five-year period. Roughly
one-third of this would be for headquarters
operations, and the remainder for programs
to be carried on outside headquarters.
The centre will be, as he said, problem-oriented. This means that the centre's job will
be to define specific problems in developing
areas, and to provide the resources, both technological and human, necessary to be applied
towards a solution. In this way the centre will
not be a traditional aid institution nor a traditional research one. The centre will determine specific areas of research priority, wfll

and test the resuits of these findings. It will
not be concerned with dispensing aid, but
rather with ways of making aid effective in
terms of present-day expectations.
The developing countries themselves will
neyer be adequately helped by a simple
transfer of wealth. It is necessary to boister
and build their economies. This cannot be
done unless we are prepared to help them
develop indigenous capabilities resulting i
levels of wealth which. will open for them the
doors to international trade and the community of mankind.
The widening gap between the economically developed and the less economically developed worlds is, in reality, a science and technology gap. We of the developed world have
sufficient knowledge of the tools offered by
science and technology to apply them. to our
peculiar development problems, but this same
science and technology must be made adaptable before it can be of benefit to the developing countries. If not, it remains of littie use in
fact.
As the concept of this centre was taking
shape, national and international individuals
and institutions gave willingly of their time
and resources to assure its establishment.
With their further enthusiastic support and
participation I believe that the centre has
every chance of becoming a truly international institution for development and one of
which this country may be proud.

be upon Canada with respect to the identification of effective programs of action.
I am confident that those who will be
chosen by the ,Government to lead this centre
into action, once the bill becomes law, will
not let us down. The problem of assistance to
underdeveloped countries is one of the foremost obligations of the modemn state. On the
more fortunate countries like Canada the
responsibility is particularly heavy. At the

initiative that will give meaning to these programs of development assistance, will make

senators, which I put forward in support of

EXPROPRIATION BILL
SECOND READING
The Senate resumed from yesterday the
adjourned debate on the motion of Hon. Mr.
Urquhart for the second reading of Bill C-136,
respecting the expropriation of land.
Hon. Salier A. Hayden: Honourable senators, there has been substantial debate on this
bill in this chamber. It has ranged over all the
important details of the bill, and I hesitated
for a long time before deciding that I would
speak.
However, during the long years of practice
of the law I have been in many expropriation
cases under the then existing law both in
Ontario and elsewhere in Canada, and not
only in cases before the courts, but also in
negotiations that ultimately were concluded
without having to go to the courts. So I can
testify to the many hours that have been
consumed in attempting to resolve what
appeared to be the difficulties and confusion
that have developed as to what was the real

Hon. Mr. Grosari: That was not part of the
question.
Hon. Mr. Martin: I think the present Secretary of State for External Affairs has done a
commendable job-no one could have done
better.
The present Secretary of State for External
Affairs will be the minister reporting to Parliament. However, I would call my honourable friend's attention to section 2 of the Interpretation Act which defines "Minister" as
"such member of the Queen's Privy Council
for Canada as is designated by the Governor
in Council to act as the Minister for the purposes of this Act."
This formula is now being employed in all
acts. Instead of designating a particular minister, this general language is used anticipating that in the process of government reorganization it is difficult, unless there is this
generality of language, to designate precisely
[Hon. Mr. Martin.)

March 4, 1970

SENATE DEBATES

formula that should be applied in arriving at
value.
It has been said in some judicial decisions
that compensation claims are statutory and
depend upon statutory provisions. This is
under the law as it existed before the new
Ontario act and before this bill was introduced, but if one reads through the cases one
will find that the principles and the rules
which came into play in determining due
compensation were to be found really in the
decided cases.
Now we have in the Ontario act, which is
an existing statute-and we will have in this
bill, when it becomes law-codes of rules for
compensation. Perhaps, since these codes are
so specific, the principle which runs through
some legal decisions of years ago may become
true in fact and in law, and that the principle
in determining compensation is that "compensation claims are statutory and depend upon
statutory provisions."
I had intended to say something about compensation and to make a comparison of the
Ontario act and this bill, but as this subject
has been thoroughly developed by those who
have preceded me, I am not going to be
repetitious.
I should point out, however, that the Law
Reform Commission in Ontario, presided over
by Mr. Justice McRuer, did recommend in
one of its reports
that the "value to the owner" test be
abandoned in favour of a formula by
which the compensation is arrived at by
the making of separate assessments of (1)
the market value of the interest expropriated; and (2) the damages attributable
to the expropriation.
When you read the particular sections of
the Ontario statute and the particular clauses
in this bill, you will find that principle has
been recognized and adopted both in the
Ontario act and in this bill.
That is all I have to say about the question
of compensation, not because I am not ready
to say more, but I think I would be presumptuous in attempting to tell you what you have
already been told by the previous speakers.
I should point out, however, that the doctrine of what they call equivalent reinstatement has been recognized. In the Law Reform
Report of Mr. Justice McRuer the equivalent
reinstatement principle was put in this
fashion:
Reinstatement
means
placing the
owner from whom the property is taken
in a substantially equivalent position by

means of substituted property. Where
this principle is applied, in expropriation
proceedings the desired result is generally achieved by providing the owner with
the funds to reinstate himself.
The doctrine of equivalent reinstatement was developed at common law in
order to do justice where the ordinary
methods of valuation would not provide
adequate compensation where there was
no market for property owing to the particular purpose to which it was put. Land
used for churches, schools and hospitals
has been treated in this way. The doctrine is at present part of the law of
Ontario.
The Law Reform Report accordingly
recommended that:
-where land is devoted to a purpose of
such a nature that there is no general
demand or market for land for that purpose, compensation be paid on the basis
of the reasonable cost of equivalent reinstatement. Such compensation should be
paid only when the owner has a bona fide
intention to relocate.
This was incorporated in the Ontario Statute,
and it has also been incorporated in the bill
before us.
However, I would like to direct your attention to a question that bothers me a little
namely, the scope of the inquiry, because
both the Ontario act and this bill provide for
an inquiry at a stage when there is an objection by the person whose property it is
intended to expropriate, and for an inquiry
officer.
In the Ontario act, section 7(5), this is the
scope:
The hearing shall be by means of an
inquiry conducted by the inquiry officer
who shall inquire into whether the taking
of the lands or any part of the land of an
owner or of more than one owner of the
same lands is fair, sound and reasonably
necessary in the achievement of the
objectives of the expropriating authority.
This section apparently embodies the
recommendation made in the McRuer Report,
that the merits of the expropriating authority's general policy should not be considered
relevant in the inquiry. It is only, as the
report says, the "taking of the land"-that is
why I put particular emphasis on those words
in the Ontario act-which is the object of the
inquiry, not the "objectives". The extent to

SENATE DEBATES
which "objectives" will be kept out of an
inquiry, notwithstanding the background that
led to the drafting of this section in this form,
will undoubtedly depend on the jurisprudence which will grow around the words
"fair, sound and reasonably necessary" in
the achievement of the objectives of the
expropriating authority.
So far as the federal bill is concerned, the
section that deals with the scope and purpose
of the inquiry is not, in my view, clear in the
fashion in which the Ontario section is. The
language in clause 7 of the bill is as follows:
Any person who objects to the intended expropriation of an interest in land to
which a notice of intention relates may,
within thirty days from the day the
notice is given, serve on the Minister an
objection in writing stating the name and
address of such person and indicating the
nature of his objection, the grounds on
which his objection is based and the
nature of his interest in the matter of the
intended expropriation.

March 4, 1970

soundness and fairness of taking the particular piece of land described in the
proposed expropriation plans should be
the main issue at the hearing. The public
interest and the interests of the owner
must be considered. Evidence and comment on this issue, and on related issues
such as the feasibility of the modification
of the expropriation plan, or alternative
sites or routes, or the taking of a lesser
estate or interest in the land, should be
relevant. The scope of the hearing we
recommend is more restricted than in the
United Kingdom, where the merits of the
proposed work may be examined.

This poses an important question. If the
minister is the one who is making the
decision on his responsibility as a minister,
and as a matter of government policy, then in
my view it should not be left to an inquiry
and an inquiry officer to determine whether
the policy that put in motion this expropriation proceeding is a proper policy or is
backed by substantial reason and purpose.
The minister bas his responsibility to Parlialimiting words in the ment and to the people, and it should not be

SENATE DEBATES

Council, which ruled in favour of the appellant, and said that the appellant was entitled
to depreciation. The matter was referred back
to the deputy minister for taxation, and
whatever was bothering him in the first place
was stili bothering him to the extent that he
allowed depreciation in the amount of $1. The
case went back to the Privy Council, which
then decided that this was not the exercise of
discretion, and so the whole matter had to be
dealt with again.
Perhaps this is a parallel, perhaps it is not.
I am wondering what would be the situation
if the minister, where he is obliged to give
reasons, give reasons that are insubstantial, or
which on their face do not disclose any justification for rejecting the report. What then
is the position of the owner? Frankly, I am
not prepared to express an opinion at this
stage, but I think this is a point that should
be discussed in committee. What was the
intention of the drafters. If "Reasons for not
accepting the report of the inquiry officer" is
written at the top of the page, did they
intend that everything written under it would
constitute the reasons? I think there should
be some clarification of that provision.
Hon. Lionel Choquette: Honourable senators, as is usually the case, my good friend
Senator Hayden has explained this bill very
fully. He has made constructive suggestions
along the lines of those I had intended to
make while comparing this bill with the
Ontario act which is similar and which
preceded this bill, having been passed in
1968-69.
Bill C-136 is indeed a citizens' bill for
which the Government should be congratulated. As Senator Phillips has said:
Emphasis has been placed on the rights
of the subject rather than on the privileges of the executive part of the
Government.
The objectives of the bill are praiseworthy. In
large measure, the bill meets the criticism
directed at federal expropriation procedures
in the past. In its scope, objectives, and
intent, the bill deserves the support of this
honourable Senate.
The bill attempts to update the law relating
to expropriation of land by the federal Government and its agencies. In large measure it
does achieve this by providing for public
notice in advance of any expropriation; a
public hearing to consider objections to any
proposed expropriation; the right of an
expropriated party to receive an offer of full

compensation which he may accept unconditionally and without prejudice to his right to
assert an additional claim for compensation; a
comprehensive code to determine the compensation payable which, in addition to the
market value of the property at the time of
its taking, will include costs or losses incidental to disturbance including moving costs, the
costs of relocating a residence in reasonably
equivalent premises; interest at an economic
rate that will fluctuate from time to time, and
which will not be less than the average yield
from Government of Canada treasury bills;
and the express provision for the payment of
costs in three stages.
The indictment levelled at the existing
Expropriation Act by the Honourable Mr.
Justice Thorson, and read into the record by
Senator Phillips (Rigaud), is rather interesting
but somewhat inaccurate. When the then
learned President of the Exchequer Court
stated that "Canada has the most arbitrary
system of expropriation of land in the whole
of the civilized world," he engaged in what
the legal profession calls judicial exaggeration, by way of obiter dicta, to bring home
the point that the Expropriation Act was in
bad need of change.
The learned judge, personally, may not
have been aware of any country in the socalled civilized world that exercises its right
of eminent domain in the arbitrary manner
he attributes to Canada. However, these countries do exist-in particular, one of our mother
countries, England.
Although the common law of England establishes a presumption against the taking of
private property without compensation, and
although the eminent English jurist and legal
scholar, Sir William Blackstone, declared that
private property should be taken by the state
only upon payment of compensation, the basic
principle of the English Constitution is the
supremacy of Parliament. The only guide to
what Parliament may do is what Parliament
has already done. Therefore, in England there
is no constitutional principle declaring the
inviolability of private property or, indeed,
the inviolability of any truly basic human
right.
It is not surprising therefore, that under the
laws of our country the Crown, as a strict
matter of law, has the power to expropriate
land for public purposes without compensation to the owner. Lord Justice Dunedin, in

SENATE DEBATES
Cedars vs. Lacoste, reported in the Appeal
Cases of England for the year 1914, said:
The law of Canada, as regards the principles upon which compensation for land
taken is to be awarded, is the same as the
law of England.
This case involved an expropriation under
our Dominion Railway Act.
Fortunately, all nations did not inherit the
invidious doctrine of the supremacy of Parliament as it developed in English constitu ional law. An astute historian one day may trace
the source of this doctrine to Hobbes'
Leviathan published in 1651. There the process began of identifying sovereignty with de
facto power. Might makes the sovereign, and
law is what he commands. One cannot help
but share our present Prime Minister's desire
to limit, constitutionally, the supremacy of
Parliament by subjecting its edicts to judicial
scrutiny in matters of basic human rights.
Our other mother country, France, was
saved from such an experience. In the old
French law, expropriation was known as "retrait d'utilité publique". In the exercise of this
right an extensive system of canals was built
during the reign of Louis XIV, and Louis XV
acquired the land necessary for some of the
main roads in France. Although there were
no detailed rules setting forth the rights of
the subject and the state, the principle that
compensation must be paid was firmly
established.
Montesquieu enshrined this principle in his
Esprit des Lois when he said:
Si le magistrat politique veut faire
quelque édifice public, quelque nouveau
chemin, il faut qu'il indemnise. Le public
est, à cet égard, comme un particulier qui
traite avec un particulier. C'est bien assez
qu'il puisse contraindre un citoyen de lui
vendre son héritage et qu'il lui ôte ce
grand privilège qu'il tient de la loi, de ne
pouvoir être forcé d'aliéner son bien.
[Translation]
If the political magistrate wants to
build some public building, some new
road, he must offer compensation. In this
respect, the public is considered as a private citizen dealing with another private
citizen. It is quite enough that the public
may compel a citizen to sell his heritage,
that it may deprive him of this great
privilege which he holds under the law
that he not be forced to alienate his
property.
[English]
The Constituent Assembly recognized the
right of the state to expropriate in the public

interest. Article 17 of the Declaration of
Rights of 1789 set down the principles which
govern expropriation:
La propriété est inviolable et sacrée; nul
ne peut en être privé, si ce n'est lorsque
la nécessité publique, légalement constatée, l'exige évidemment, et sous la condition d'une juste et préalable indemnité.
[Translation]
Property is inviolable and sacred; none
may be deprived of it, unless the public
interest, legally ascertained, obviously so
requires and provided there is fair and
previous compensation.
[English]
These principles were consecrated definitively in article 545 of the Code Napoléon,
which is textually the same as article 407 of
the Civil Code of Lower Canada.
Although the law of eminent domain in the
United States considers the right of eminent
domain to be a basic attribute of constitutional sovereignty vested in the legislature of so
high a nature that it can neither be given up
by contract nor exhausted by exercise, two
amendments to the United States Constitution
protect the private right in property. The
Fifth Amendment declares that private property shall not be taken for public use without
just compensation. The Fourteenth Amendment prohibits a state from depriving a citizen of his property without due process of
law.
Bill C-136 takes us a long way, but in commending the Government for this bill we
should not neglect commending the several
provincial governments, in particular the
Government of Ontario, who have already
reviewed and passed their new legislation on
expropriation.

Hon. Mr. Martin: What other provincial
governments have enacted legislation?
Hon. Mr. Choquette: I am coming to that
point.
In his press release of May 23, 1969, the
Minister of Justice acknowledged his indebtedness to these provincial governments. He
noted that the federal Government, in preparing its bill, had been the residual beneficiary
of the provincial reviews. He added:
I hesitate to single out any particular
work, but I would be remiss if I did not
acknowledge the valuable findings of the
Honourable Mr. McRuer in Ontario and
the Honourable Mr. Clyne of British
Columbia.
I think that answers the last question.
Hon. Mr. Martin: Yes.
Hon. Mr. Choquelle: The Ontario Expropriations Act, 1968-69, came into force on

March 4, 1970

SENATE DEBATES

December 20, 1968. It is based substantially
on the report of the Ontario Law Reform
Commission and the recommendations in the
report of the Royal Commission Inquiry into
Civil Rights made in February 1968 by the
Honourable James C. McRuer and known as
the McRuer Report on Civil Rights. In many
respects Bill C-136 reflects substantially the
provisions of the Ontario Expropriations Act,
1968-69, but in one important respect it does
not. I invite your attention to this important
point.
Clause 14, subclause 1 of Bill C-136 imposes
on the minister the obligation to make within
90 days an offer of full compensation to the
expropriated party, who may accept this offer
without prejudice to his right to claim additional compensation in respect of the expropriation. However, clause 14, subclause 2, permits the minister to delay making such an
off er within the 90-day period, with the penal
provision that further interest at the rate of
only five per cent must be paid on the compensation for the period of default by the
minister. The key words in section 14, subsection 2, are the following:
Where, in any case, it is not practicable
for the Minister to make an offer of compensation under this section-within the
applicable period-the Minister shall
make such an offerAnd these are the words I want to discuss
-as soon as practicable after the expiration of that period.
My criticism is twofold. First, there are no
norms to determine when it is not practicable
for the minister to make the offer, and the
minister is accountable to no one for the
delay in making the offer. The only penal
provision is to pay interest at five per cent.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: Would the honourable
senator indicate where five per cent is stated?
Hon. Mr. Choquette: I do not have the bill
before me, but I will find it.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: I should like to point out
for the honourable senator that the word
"interest" is used in the section that he read.
It refers to section 33, and I note that interest
is defined in that section as to what is the
basic rate, and it is a varying rate.
Hon. Mr. Choquette: It is a varying rate?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: Yes.
Hon. Mr. Choquette: I will come to that
point.
Secondly, the interest rate should not
simply be five per cent but should be an
economic rate. Whatever the rate is, my
suggestion is that it should be an economic

rate that will fluctuate from time to time and
will not be less than the average yield from
Government of Canada Treasury bills, in the
same manner as the other provisions for
interest in the bill. I adopt as my own the
words of the Honourable Mr. Justice Thorson,
quoted by the honourable Senator Phillips the
other day, when he said: "The settlement of
claims to compensation is frequently unconscionably delayed."
The Ontario Expropriation Procedures Act,
1968-69, by section 25(1) obliges the expropriating party to offer the amount of full
compensation within three months after
expropriation. The time within which the
offer must be made may be extended only by
a judge under section 25(3). In order better to
achieve the objectives of Bill C-136, I recommend that it not be left to the minister to
decide that it is impracticable to make an
offer within the prescribed time, but rather
that the minister be obliged to apply to the
Exchequer Court for an order extending time
for making such an offer along the lines set
forth in section 25(3) of the Ontario act. That
section reads as follows:
The expropriating authority may, within
the period mentioned in subsection (1)
and before taking possession of the land,
upon giving at least two days' notice to
the registered owner, apply to the judge
for an order extending any time referred
to in subsection (1) and the judge may in
his order authorize the statutory authority to take possession of the land before
the expiration of the extended time for
serving the offer or statement under
clause (a) of subsection (1) upon such
conditions as are specified in the order.
Subsection 3 of section 25 is a new section
in the Ontario act, which did not appear
previously. I do not suggest that the exact
wording of the Ontario Statute be followed in
the bill before us. I do suggest, however, that
the minister be obliged to apply to the court
to extend the time, and that accordingly
clause 14(2) of the bill before us be amended
in this sense. I shall make a motion to this
effect in due course. I think the proper place
would not be in this chamber, but when the
bill is in committee I intend to make such a
suggestion, and if necessary, after we have
discussed the matter, propose an amendment.
I am sure that if after serious discussion the
committee finds that this is an amendment
that should be made, it will not hesitate to
make it. In addition, I shall move that the
interest rate be increased from five per cent
to the same rate provided elsewhere in the
bill.

SENATE DEBATES
Hon. Mr. Hayden: If my honourable friend
will permit, I want to make a correction. I am
sorry, I may have misled you. I made reference to section 33, where it will be found that
there is a basic rate in subsection 2, which is
a five per cent rate for late payment, which is
an additional amount. Anybody late in payment has to pay five per cent, by way of
penalty, then pay interest at the basic rate,
which is a varying rate, from the date upon
first entering into possession until making the
payment.

SALTFISH BILL
SECOND READING-DEBATE ADJOURNED

Hon. William J. Petten moved the second
reading of Bill C-175, to establish the Canadian Saltfish Corporation and regulate interprovincial and export trade in saltfish in order to
improve the earnings of primary producers of
cured cod fish.
He said: Honourable senators, the bill
before us is of prime interest to fishermen and
the general public of my Province of Newfoundland and Labrador, as well as other
parts of the Atlantic coast of our nation.
Newfoundland was settled because of the
abundance of cod to be found around her
coast.
The production of salted and dried codfish
is the oldest industry in this country, antedating the earliest settlement, and it was for long
years a staple commodity in our export trade.
The international trade in the product bas
been contracting slowly until it is now not
much in excess of 150,000 metric tons annually. The Canadian share of this trade has been
declining, especially in recent years, and is at
present about 20 per cent of the total. World
consumption of the product bas remained virtually constant, however, at approximately
250,000 metric tons, and demand for it in
substantial quantity, with modifications of
form, no doubt, is expected to persist
indefinitely.
In 1918, Sir William Coaker, the then Minister of Marine Fisheries in Newfoundland,
attempted to bring in regulations to control
grading, packaging, exporting, et cetera. However, he did not have the backing of all
exporters, and the plan feU through. With the
coming of government by commission in
Newfoundland, the commission formed the
Fisheries Board and introduced many of
Coaker's regulations. Because of their absolute control, they could do what he could not.
In World War II, the export of codfish came
under the Combine Food Board. All food for

export was controlled by this board and the
price of salted cod was established for the
first time. This meant that a fisherman would
know at the beginning of a season what
prices he would receive. At the end of the
war this board phased out and the Newfoundland Associated Fish Exporters Limited
came into being. NAFEL had a monopoly on
exports and this helped to stabilize the industry. After Confederation, the federal Government, although not too happy with the
monopoly, allowed it to continue until 1957.
When NAFEL lost its monopoly the members
decided to continue as an exporting body. It
has generally been conceded that the disappearance of control marketing and the
devaluation of the pound sterling, together
created a situation in which the Government
of Canada has been asked for help twice in
the last three years.
During the centuries a large number of
communities on the Atlantic coast of Canada
were founded on saltfish production and
export. Several hundred of these are in
remote areas of northern Quebec, Newfoundland and Labrador. The development of a
modern groundfishery, filleted and frozen
production, of other fisheries and of other
industries, has left most of these communities
untouched. They remain heavily dependent
on the production and sale of the traditional
commodity.
In such places saltfish is produced by small
fishing crews, utilizing the inshore runs of cod
in mid-summer. Except for the installation of
power in boats, the equipment and methods
used have not changed since the eighteenth
century. In the areas referred to, it is estimatare some 3,000 crews
ed that there
engaged each season in this operation. That
would represent roughly 10,000 fishermen
and, with their families, about 35,000 people
or 20 to 25 per cent of the fishery-dependent
population in Newfoundland and Labrador.
According to available information, the
yearly cash income of a fisherman's household
in these communities typically approximates
$2,500. Not much more than 35 per cent of
this amount is obtained from fishing, however, and nearly 50 per cent is obtained in the
form of transfer payments from government.
Essentially the plight of these people is due
to their extremely low productivity as fishermen-processors, a situation that has worsened
lately as a result of two developments: one,
an increase in pressure by the international
fleets on the natural resource, which bas
caused the inshore runs of codfish to fall off,
and, two, a movement of additional crews into

SENATE DEBATES
the small-boat fishery in the late 1950s and
1960s, brought about by a crop in alternative
employment opportunities relative to population growth particularly in Newfoundland.
The crisis implicit in this situation was
averted for some time by a sustained rise in
the price of saltfish, beginning about 1950 and
associated with a continuous shift after that
date in the utilization of inshore cod landings
in the Atlantic region from cured to frozen
fillet production. This took place in other
exporting countries as well and caused
exports of saltfish generally to contract more
rapidly than the requirements of the trade
in importing countries.
The price level reached an all-time peak in
1967. Late in that year currencies were
devalued in a number of countries where the
product is produced and consumed. This,
combined with growing resistance to the purchase of the traditional product from Canada,
resulted in a collapse of the price obtainable
for the greater proportion of the latter. In
1968 the federal Government was forced to
purchase large quantities of saltfish for relief
feeding-luckily this outlet existed-and, to
support the earnings of the fishermen
involved, prices for the production of the 1969
season are being subsidized.
Obviously, reorganization of the saltfish
trade in Canada will not by itself solve the
economic and social problems described here.
A massive program or combination of programs designed (a) to resettle large numbers
of the people now dependent on fishing for a
livelihood and to provide remunerative occupations for them, and, (b) to upgrade the
productivity of those who remain, is necessary for that purpose.
What trade reorganization of the kind
proposed can do, in association with the programs just referred to, is to facilitate transition from the traditional to updated ways of
saltfish production-a task that the private
trade appears to be incapable of undertaking.
As those programs take effect, and many of
the existing producers are removed from
their present areas of isolation, the supply of
saltfish from the traditional source may be
expected progressively to decline. During this
phase, whatever its duration, the proposed
agency should be able to maximize the prices
that producers receive for saltfish. It would be
in a position to improve marketing services
and to reduce costs in the handling of the
product.
If there is a continuing demand for saltfish
in the markets of the world, and to the extent
that such demand can sustain a product price
[Hon. Mr. Petten.]

March 4, 1970

consistent with production costs in Canada,
the corporation would be in a position to
replace, or promote the replacement of, the
traditional supply with saltfish produced
under conditions of strict form and quality
control in modern plants or curing stations.
This, in fact, would be its major long-term
objective.
As indicated in the bill, the Saltfish Corporation would have broad powers for the
accomplishment of the immediate and longerrun purposes outlined above. Under complementary provincial legislation, it would
become the exclusive owner of all saltfish
produced in the Atlantic region-excepting
certain categories of the product that may be
exempted, temporarily or otherwise, from its
control, by federal-provincial agreement. Its
powers under the federal act would permit it
to control the movement of the product
through processing and handling operations
and the channels of trade to the point of final
sale in the domestic market and abroad.
In practice it is anticipated that the corporation would make the fullest possible use of
existing traders and processors as its agents
in assembling supply from primary producers
and in carrying out such processing, packing,
storing and shipping operations as may be
required. These services would be obtained on
contract, with rates of payment or commission being negotiated between the corporation
and the suppliers. Such rates would thus tend
to approximate the costs of the most efficient
of the latter and in this way the returns to
fishermen might be raised substantially above
the current level.
It is visualized that the corporation would
specify target prices at the beginning of each
season, based on an assessment of market
prospects. On delivery of supply to the corporation, the primary producers would receive
some proportion of this price as an initial
payment. When the season's stocks had been
cleared the producers would share in net surpluses on the basis of participatory rights.
The details of this arrangement, as to pools,
et cetera, would be worked out by the agency's management in the course of phasing
into operation.
Honourable senators, I am confident that
the passing of this long-needed measure enabling the establishment of the Canadian Saltfish Corporation will do a great deal to
improve the saltfish industry and to better
the lot of the inshore fishermen of the Atlantic coast of Canada.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Macdonald, debate
adjourned.

SENATE DEBATES

CRIMINAL CODE
PUNISHMENT

FOR THEFT-BILL TO AMENDSECOND READING

The Senate resumed from Thursday, February 19, the adjourned debate on the motion of
Hon. Mr. Macdonald for the second reading of
Bill S-21, to amend the Criminal Code.
Hon. Jacques Flynn: Honourable senators,
Bill S-21, which was so ably introduced by its
sponsor on February 19, has as its purpose to
amend the Criminal Code. The arguments
that were used to support the proposed
changes were succinct and perspicuous, and
the idea itself is the epitome of good common
sense.
Bill S-21 bears the distinctive imprint of a
man preoccupied with justice and reason.
Under Section 280 of the Criminal Code,
the punishment for theft is potentially much
greater when the value of that which is stolen
exceeds $50, since it provides imprisonment
for as many as ten years, whereas when the
value does not exceed $50, the guilty party is
liable, under the Code as it now reads, only to
a maximum of two years.
The bill before us would serve to raise the
valuation to $200, thus making an convicted
person liable to a maximum of ten years'
imprisonment only if the value of that which
he bas stolen or the value of the stolen item
of which he has become the possessor exceeds
$200.
The $50 value figure was originally intended as a demarcation line between major and
minor thefts. I do not know if the figure was
very realistic when it was first introduced in
1954, but I fully agree with Senator Macdonald that as a result of inflation the heavier
and more severe penalty provided for theft
when the value of that stolen is over $50 is
now the penalty when the real value is considerably less than the $50 of 1954. I further
agree that for Parliament to allow this economic phenomenon to alter the effect and
intent of its legislation would constitute a
serious dereliction of duty, one which no
legislative body conscientious about its
responsibilities to the citizenry could possibly
accept.
If criminal laws are to be taken seriously, if
criminal laws are to have a beneficial effect
upon society, they must be regarded by
everyone as realistic and fair. If we want our
laws to act as deterrents to crime, it behooves
us to see to it that the punishment fits the
crime.

Needless to say, the way in which a law is
applied by the courts has an effect upon
whether or not the law is treated with
respect. This aspect of the problem falls properly within the purview of the judiciary.
However, we cannot for all that abrogate our
responsibilities. If laws are deficient or outdated, they are not to be left to the courts to
amend in practice by judicious application.
For these reasons I support Bill S-21.
Hon. Paul Marfin: Honourable senators, the
Leader of the Opposition said that the sponsor of this bill, Senator Macdonald, was a
man who was preoccupied with justice and
reason. I am sure we all agree with that. I
would add that he is a man who has been
preoccupied not only with justice and reason
but with diligence. This bill reflects the diligent way in which he has pursued his obligations in this chamber.
Some ministers of justice have argued that
an amendment of the Criminal Code should
not as a rule be proceeded with in an ad hoc
way. But the Minister of Justice, as Senator
Macdonald and others are aware, bas given
an indication that he proposes soon to bring
in a measure providing for continuous law
reform, including the Criminal Code. If he
were standing in my place at this moment he
might suggest that we wait until there was
the opportunity for a revision not only of this
particular matter but of other sections. I am
not going to make that argument now. The
bill will go before a committee and the officers of the Crown will be in a position to
comment on it. However, I felt that in view of
the position of the Minister of Justice I should
make this observation.
Motion agreed to and bill read second time.

STATUTORY INSTRUMENTS
PROPOSED STUDY OF PROCEDURES BY LEGAL
AND CONSTITUTIONAL AFFAIRS COMMITTEE-DEBATE CONTINUED

The Senate resumed from February 19 the
adjourned debate on the motion of Hon.
Mr. Martin that the Standing Senate Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs
be instructed to consider and, from time
to time, to report on procedures for the
review by the Senate of instruments made in
virtue of any statute of the Parliament of

SENATE DEBATES

Canada, and to consider in connection therewith any public documents relevant thereto.
Hon. Jacques Flynn: Honourable senators,
it is with a great deal of pleasure that I rise
to lend my support to the motion which has
been presented by the Leader of the Government (Hon. Mr. Martin). As I said when
I adjourned this debate, I am in agreement
with the principle that must have given
birth to the motion at hand, and in my
remarks I plan to limit myself to speaking on
this principle rather than to delve into the
possible methods of controlling delegated
legislation. This latter problem will be dealt
with by the Standing Senate Committee on
Legal and Constitutional Affairs when this
motion is passed and the committee is entrusted with the task of studying this thorny
question.
In most contemporary democracies one of
the principal and inevitable areas of contention is the field of the rights of the individual,
on the one hand, and of the rights of the
society in which he lives, on the other.
Government, in most democracies, bas in
the past three or four decades grown so much
that the swelling of the apparatus seems
uncontrollable; ministers, departments, boards
and regulations all multiply like rabbits.
The most nefarious result of this colossal
growth in the size and authority of the
bureaucracy responsible for administering the
plethora of laws which we have has too often
been the unjustified limitation and sornetimes
complete strangulation of individual rights.
There have been cases in which government officials have deliberately substituted
their own will for the provisions of the law in
the belief that they were improving it and
achieving, in some way not stated, the very
ends which they thought the law was intended to achieve. There is generally no doubt
about the good will and sincerity of government officials. However, we should, in selfdefense, arm ourselves, to the extent necessary, adequately to defend against an apparent manic propensity for the drafting of
statutory instruments. It behooves us to bear
in mind that the legislative function is properly that of Parliament. Although, for the
sake of administrative efficiency, we often
delegate the power to enact the rules and
regulations required to particularize the
application of any given statute, the fact
remains that Parliament, and Parliament
alone, has been entrusted by the electorate
with the task of legislating. Hence, the upper
and lower houses, if they are to carry out
[Hon. Mr. Martin.]

March 4, 1970

their duties conscientiously, must devise some
method of overseeing and controlling all the
legislating that is done in their name. The
citizens of Canada must, at all cosLs, be protected against the arbitrary laws that have
been, and will continue to be, formulated by
these administrative bodies or individuals.
Individual freedom in all countries has
been gradually reduced in the last hundred
years not only, or not chiefly, because of the
growing interdependence of individuals and
nations, but also because of the very fact that
statutory laws entitle officials to behave in
ways which, according to the standards of
some years ago, would have been judged as
usurpations of power and encroachments
upon the individual freedom of the citizen.
The dangers of delegated legislation cannot
be over-emphasized. Bureaucrats tend to
exalt administrative convenience and the
national advantage at the expense of the
individual and his freedom. The government
official in his zeal to achieve a desirable result
often imposes an unreasonable burden upon
the citizen. The power under a statute to
make rules gives the civil servant with a
knack for making capricious regulations the
ideal opportunity to work out his latent
megalomania on a defenseless public. Delegated legislation is a sort of blank cheque which
affords the executive an opportunity of
adding to or subtracting from the substance
of the law. And all this is going on without
the benefit of judicious scrutiny on the part
of those having the responsibility to watch
over the human rights and civil liberties of
the citizen.
We have here an extremely sensitive issue,
since the power to delegate legislative
authority could conceivably be used for the
partial or total abrogation of constitutional
government. If Parliament uses its unlimited
legislative power to delegate that power to
another body, parliamentary government is
thus to that extent suspended. In Germany,
this was in fact the method used by Hitler to
achieve his insane ends. No clearer proof
could be advanced to support the old adage
that the price of liberty is eternal vigilance.
The successful administrator is the man
who retains in his own hand the general
direction of policy and leaves matters of
detail to his subordinates, while at the same
time keeping their work under close observation. Parliament is in a similar position. It is
always in danger of being so overburdened
with detail that it bas not sufficient time left
to devote to broad matters of policy. The first
duty of Parliament is to keep the policy and

March 4. 1970

SENATE DEBATES

administration of cabinet ministers under
critical scrutiny, and its second duty is to
pass legislation. If these broad matters of
principle are to be fully considered, Parliament must not be too deeply immersed in
detail. It is therefore wise to delegate power
to ministers, but as there is no clear dividing
line between detail and principle, Parliament
must ensure that the powers given to ministers are not abused, and the law courts must
make certain that they are not exceeded.
Most acts contain a specific clause permitting the cabinet to pass orders in coundil
affecting enforcement. Some statutes go as far
as to authorize cabinet to pass regulations
changing the very principles of acts. Such
clauses, when giving the Governor in Council
power to make rules generally for carrying
out the purposes and provision of an act are
frankly dangerous and, to me, give too general powers.
No worthwhile provision is at present made
in our legislative system for an organized
review of subordinate legislation by or on
behalf of the legislature.
For concrete evidence of the magnitude of
this problem and the pressing need that exists
for our establishing some vehicle for the efficient review by Parliament of all statutory
instruments, I take you back to the debate we
had in this chamber and in the Banking,
Trade and Commerce Committee during the
last session on Bill S-26, to prohibit the
advertising, sale and importation of hazardous products.
As you will recall, one of the amendments
we made to that bill had the effect of requiring that if any additions to or deletions from
the two schedules contained in this bill were
made by order in council, then, at some time,
the order should go back to Parliament for
Parliament to decide whether this should be
maintained. The amendment that was rejected by the Commons would have required that
within two years an amending bill be submitted confirming the order, and, if it were not
confirmed or if a bill did not go in within that
time, the order would cease to have any
effect.
The Commons refused that amendment and
asked us to concur in theirs which had the
effect that unless Parliament went out of its
way to revoke an order or part of it, the
order would remain in effect. Human nature
being what it is, their amendment further
facilitated the bringing into being of new
regulations or additions to existing ones.

The chairman of the Commons Committee
on Statutory Instruments agreed with us at
the time of the report that the Commons
amendment had simply emasculated the point
we had been trying to make with our amendment. It was on this occasion that we were
promised by the Government-I do not know
if it was by the leader-that this problem of
such significant import would be considered
by one of our standing committees.
Therefore I am delighted to agree with
Senator Martin's motion to instruct the
Senate Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs to study the matter. It will be interesting to see if this committee ends up agreeing with any, most or all of the
recommendations made by the Special Committee on Statutory Instruments which studied the problem at the request of the House
of Commons.
Certainly much thought went into the
report of the Commons committee. It was
obviously inspired by the British experience
in the area of dealing with the control of
delegated legislation and also, to some extent,
by the experience of other Commonwealth
nations and provinces of Canada.
I am not averse to accepting the suggestion
that the report of the Commons committee be
used as the basis for our study of the question. This, along with the first volume of the
Ontario Royal Commission's Inquiry into Civil
Rights, in which the Honourable James
McRuer devotes some fifty pages to subordinate legislative powers-reference was made
to this report when we were discussing the
Expropriation Bill-possesses the virtue of
being fresh. They are probably the latest studies that have been made on this question,
and, hence, are more than likely to contain
the most appropriate material for our
consideration.
Hon. Lazarus Phillips: Honourable senators,
I am indebted as indeed we all are to the
Government Leader for presenting this motion
to the house for our consideration. For our
guidance, the third report of the Commons
Committee to which Senator Flynn has
referred will indeed be helpful to us. I
remember on one occasion reading of Benjamin Disraeli, in referring to the speeches of
Mr. Gladstone, saying that Mr. Gladstone was
inebriated by the exuberance of his own verbosity. I think in the case of the parliamentary process, we as a Parliament are in
danger
of
being
smothered
by the
exuberance of legislation inclusive of delegated powers and administrative directives.

SENATE DEBATES
It has been drawn to our attention as a
result of the study made by the committee of
the other place that of the 601 acts of Parliament examined, 420 provide for delegated
legislation. During the period from January 1,
1956, to December 31, 1968, 6,892 regulations
covering 19,972 pages, an average of 530
regulations a year, were published in the
Canada Gazette. This does not take into
account those regulations which are especially
exempted from publication and also some
documents which are perhaps in fact of a
legislative nature but are not considered to be
so by the regulation-making authority.
Honourable senators, this will give you
some idea of the enormity of the problem
facing both Houses of Parliament in considering the question of statutory instruments.
Incidentally, for the benefit of laymen in the
house, it should be pointed out that the
phrase "statutory instrument" is unknown to
our Canadian parliamentary system. That
which in England is referred to as a statutory
instrument is known in our law and reflected
in our statutes and in practice as a regulation.
Therefore, it will be much simpler in dealing
with the subject matter of statutory instruments if we use and think in terms of the
word "regulation," which is more familiar to
the eye and car of honourable senators.
In dealing with the subject matter of the
number of acts and the number of regulations, that is to say, delegated powers, no consideration whatever at this stage is being
given to the very important and difficult distinction between administrative acts and
directives which are voluminously published
in various departments under ministers of the
Crown. It should be kept in mind that these
administrative directives do not constitute
regulations or statutory instruments within
the true meaning of the law. So that in addition to the body of statutes and the body of
regulations, we have this extraordinary problem of a tremendous amount of administrative directives. There is no provision at this
stage whereby the citizen or the subject
receives relief particularly in respect of these
administrative directives. In order that
honourable senators may appreciate en
globale or generally the whole problem of
administrative law, one should keep in mind
that the motion now before us does not envisage the consideration of the activities of
tribunals that are created as a result of acts
of Parliament, such as transport boards, radio
and television commissions, and the like, and
immigration boards which deal with appeals
in respect of immigration. These are not cov[Hon. Mr. Phillips (Rigaud).]

March 4, 1970

ered by the subject matter now before us by
way of motion.
Incidentally, this phase of administrative
law was touched on by the Minister of Justice
recently in the announcement of the proposed
legislation which will do away with our present Exchequer Court, replacing it by a federal court which will be a court of original
jurisdiction and a court of appeal, and to
which court, as a court of original hearing
and as a court of appeal, will be referred the
rights of the citizen in respect of administrative directives and otherwise, so that in due
course we will be dealing with that phase of
administrative law. I simply direct honourable senators' attention to the fact that, in
dealing with the whole subject matter of the
protection of the subject and his property, we
are at this stage dealing only with one segment thereof.
This whole question of the invasion of the
rights of the subject, in respect of which
Senator Choquette spoke so eloquently today,
is not new. It arose sensationally, as it were,
in a very important book, The New Despotism, published by the then Lord Chief Justice
of England in 1929, The Right Honourable
Lord Hewart of Bury. It was then that the
parliamentary system in the British Commonwealth was alerted for the first time to the
danger of the invasion of the rights of property and the rights of the person. It was
indeed that extraordinary book, to which I
will have occasion to refer again, which in
1932 brought about for the first time in the
British Parliament a study of the entire problem, which was the basis of some relief granted to the subject leading to the publication of
delegated powers. But it took approximately
18 years for this Parliament to deal with the
subject under the administration of the Right
Honourable Louis St. Laurent, with the Publications Act passed in the year 1950. That
was the first time the Canadian Parliament
dealt seriously with this whole question of
delegated powers and administrative invasions of the rights of the person and the
rights of property.
I may draw honourable senators' attention
to the Special Lectures of the Law Society of
Upper Canada in 1953, for in the introduction
of Administrative Law by R. F. Reid there is
a very good summary which lays the basis for
the observations I intend to make.
In referring to the books that have dealt
with the subject of invasions of persons and
property he says the following:
The well known books begin with The
New Despotism, written by Lord Hewart,

March 4, 1970

SENATE DEBATES

published in England in 1929, when Lord
Hewart was Chief Justice of England. Its
theme was that the administrative branch
of government had embarked upon a sinister plan to take over the country, subjugate Parliament and the courts to its
bureaucratic will, violate the rule of law
and set up a modern counterpart of the
tyranny of the Stuart Kings. Whatever
the validity of its major premise, the
view was presented with great force and
colour, and created a furore which led to
a parliamentary investigation. The resulting report, which is famous in administrative law as the Report of the Committee on Ministers Powers was the first
comprehensive examination of the extent
to which the administrative branch of
government was performing parliamentary powers. This phenomenon was noted
in the title of a book by Professor John
Willis called Parliamentary Powers of
English Government Departments. The
storm raised by Lord Hewart has never
really died down and the battle of the
books has been going on merrily ever
since.

where, in speaking of the Tudor Kings and
the Stuart Kings, the Angevin Kings and the
Plantagenet Kings, indicating how the parliamentary process destroyed to a considerable
extent the prerogatives of the Crown, he said:
The old despotism, which was defeated,
offered Parliament a challenge.
And the challenge was met by the Parliaments in the Commonwealth.
The new despotism, which is not yet
defeated, gives Parliament an anaesthetic.
The strategy is different, but the goal is
the same. It is to subordinate Parliament,
to evade the Courts, and to render the
will, or the caprice, of the Executive
unfettered and supreme.

And at page 83 there appears this short
passage:
There are two kinds of delegated legislation, one based on the prerogative of the
Crown, and the other deriving its force
from some act of Parliament expressly
giving power to legislate with regard to a
particular matter either to the King in
Council or to a public minister or department or some other authority.

SENATE DEBATES
have had a bill that does not deal with delegated powers. This shows that we can have a
bill dealing with a highly intricate matter
without there being the necessity for regulation or delegated power.
In the Textile Labelling bill which I, and
honourable senators with me, had to deal, we
saw that it was necessary to provide the minister with broad delegated powers preparatory to dealing with technological aspects. In
that case the Government felt it would not be
possible to deal with the entire subject matter
in direct statute form.
Generally speaking, the excuses given for
delegated powers are, firstly, that Parliament
is too busy, and, secondly, that technological
advances and developments are such that it is
utterly impossible to cover all aspects of the
matter in a bill. These seem to be the two
major considerations. I suggest that in due
course we consider this matter in committee,
if this motion is agreed to, and that we do not
take it for granted that we must carry on in
the future as we have in the past when we
have had, as I have mentioned, 420 acts out of
601 with regulations made under them. We
should attempt to indicate to the executive
the necessity of reducing the proportion of
bills brought before Parliament that involve
delegated powers, in addition to dealing with
the problem of what should be done with
respect to delegated powers.
I commend the members of the committee
of the other place for their extremely able
handling of the subject matter. I agree with
Senator Flynn that although we are not
bound in any way by any of the recommendations or observations, some of the material
which has been subjected to an exhaustive
study and investigation will be helpful to us
in due course. I refer to: (1) the question of
the definition of "regulation"; (2) the determination of the guiding principles on what
should go into a regulation when it is drafted;
(3) the subject matter of the publication of
regulations, and (4) the determination of the
guiding principles pursuant to which the
regulation should be considered in terms of
its efficacy or the necessity for its revision or
complete abrogation.
It is interesting to note, in dealing with this
whole subject of delegated powers, that we
have an extraordinary paradox. We started
off in the Commonwealth and the United
Kingdom with the royal prerogative consisting not only of executive acts but also of
legislative acts which were not delegated
powers at all. Today the royal prerogative is
[Hon. Mr. Phillips (Rigaud).

March 4, 1970

practically confined to administrative or
executive acts-the appointment of ambassadors, the appointment of senators, and the
like-but in the legislative process through
the centuries the royal prerogative in terms
of passing legislation by order in council has
been attenuated to the point that it is practically non-existent.
As a matter of fact, in the third report it is
said that in the entire legislative process in
Canada there are only two instances of where
the royal prerogative as such, in terms of the
initial legislative authority, is exercised by
order in council. But, in the process of eliminating the direct approach by way of the
exercise of the royal prerogative on legislative enactments-that is to say, without Parliament-Parliament
has been enfiladed
through the surrender of delegated power by
regulation. So, the Crown has re-appropriated that which Parliament took centuries
upon centuries to acquire-and here I am
thinking of centuries of Tudor struggle, Stuart
struggle, and the like.
We have now a situation where the royal
prerogative, having lost its power through the
centuries, bas reacquired it with the consent
of Parliament through the process of making
orders in council through statutory delegated
legislation. In my study of the problem I have
found this, in many respects, to be one of the
most interesting and most intriguing aspects
of the subject we are considering.
Incidentally, honourable senators should be
reminded of the fact that this loss of legislative power was envisaged by the Fathers of
Confederation. Few people seem to talk about
that, but even in 1867 there was a realization
that the royal prerogative must be curbed. By
section 12 of the British North America Act,
Parliament bas the sovereign authority to
abolish all the prerogative powers or to
merge them into statutes. In 1970, 103 years
after Confederation when the Fathers of
Confederation thought of the subject, we have
by the methods I have indicated returned the
royal prerogative in an aggravated form to
the executive branch of government.
I come now to consideration of a matter
which I must confess annoyed me, and I think
it will annoy all honourable senators. The
committee of the other place recommended in
its third report that there be a special standing committee to which would be referred the
subject matter of regulations. This means that
after a bill passes second reading, and if the
Minister of Justice determines that the regulations are of such a nature as to require

March 4, 1970

SENATE DEBATES

parliamentary attention, then the regulations
or the section which authorizes the granting
of the power to make regulations will be
referred to a special standing committee
which, for the purposes of the third report, is
referred to as a scrutiny committee.
The reference to this scrutiny committee
with respect to delegated legislation will be
made concurrently with the transfer to the
ordinary standing committee in so far as the
entire bill is concerned. When the subject
matter arose as to the nature of the scrutiny
committee that should deal with the subject
matter, there was some question as to whether it should consist purely of a committee of
the other house or a joint committee of the
other house and this house.
In the early part of the report reference is
made to a series of scholars who gave evidence before the committee, one particularly,
Professor J. E. Kersell. His evidence apparently was not given too much attention
because of the fact-I am inferring this-that
he spoke too highly of the Senate and thought
that it would be par excellence a scrutiny
committee that could deal with the subject
matter of delegated authority.
At page 1489, the Third Report recommends:
Your committee therefore recommends
that a new Committee on Regulations
(hereinafter called the Scrutiny Committee) should be established with the following particulars:
(1) It should be a Standing Committee of
the House of Commons.
Notwithstanding the observations of Professor Kersell, who in 1960 wrote an outstanding
book entitled Parliamentary Supervision of
Delegated Legislation, the views of the Committee in the other house were as I stated.
May I quote Professor Kersell:
The question now arises, could a committee of the Canadian Senate be as
effective as that of the Australian, for the
Australian Senate is elective, the Canadian is appointive. The Canadian Senate is
understandably a much more reserved
chamber than its Australian counterpart,
but it does not necessarily follow that
reports of a Canadian scrutiny committee
made up of senators would be ineffective.
Much would depend on the quality of
reports which in turn would depend on
the quality of the senators serving on the
committee and on the ability of the committee's adviser or advisers. The Canadian Senate has in the past established

committees of outstanding merit and
there is no reason to believe it will cease
to be able to do so in the future. If a
Senate scrutiny committee could produce
reports of quality similar to reports from
other Canadian Senate committees and to
reports from the Australian Regulations
Committee, they would carry much of
their own conviction. This might be
enhanced by making reports from the
scrutiny committee easily available not
only to senators but also to M.P.sIn spite of this statement by a constitutional
expert in our country, we have this delightful
gem in the report in terms of what we lawyers
call a non sequitur based upon a false premise:
The committee was divided over the
question of the desirability of a Joint
Committee of both Houses as opposed to
a Standing Committee of the House of
Commons alone, as some members felt
that the non-elective and non-representative character of the Senate made it
unsuitable for this role;
Although I am a comparative newcomer
here, I hope I am observing the rules of Parliament. I have been a student of the parliamentary process and have read some political
science in my life. I am far from convinced
that those who reach the halls of Parliament
through the elective process have a complete
monopoly in competence and ability. We are
facing the extraordinary situation that the
suggestion is made that there cannot be an
act of Parliament unless it passes this house,
there cannot be delegated power unless the
sections of the statute pass this house, but
when it comes to the scrutiny review of the
delegated power there is no one in this house,
presumably, competent to deal with the subject. If, as and when this motion reaches the
stage where we will be studying the matter in
the Standing Senate Committee on Legal and
Constitutional Affairs, I am hopeful that
honourable senators will rise to the occasion
and will not allow themselves to be smothered as to their status by their own senatorial
togas. We have had too much of that in the
past and this is the opportunity for us to
assert our position and suggest that irrational
and illogical lines of reasoning are not acceptable to us and certainly do not appeal to us.
In conclusion and notwithstanding what I
believe to be this lapse, I consider that generally speaking the report commends itself to us
and will help us.

SENATE DEBATES
Incidentally, I regard section 9 of the report
as the weakest of all. We have a very learned
study on regulations, the drafting of regulations, the publication of regulations, the distinction between administrative and directive
acts, and so on. Then we have also the
suggestion of a standing, so-called scrutiny
committee, but when it comes to the determination of what the scrutiny committee should
do I find the recommendations thin indeed. It
reminds me of Cox's army marching up the
hill and marching down again after having
gone through the effort of climbing the
hill.
When this comes before our committee we
can usefully consider what I regard as a
lacuna in the studies that have been made in
the other Committee. Beyond that I would
like to draw the attention of honourable senators to the fact that for a quick review of the
report of the committee, the summary of
recommendations is to be found at page 1505.
This will be useful to read first, in terms of
working backwards.
If honourable senators feel that I have been
unduly critical with respect to some of these
matters, I apologize. I do feel, however, that
this whole question of administrative law,
statutory instruments and delegated powers
involves the necessity of highly technical
information, competence and knowledge. It is
my view that there are in this chamber outstanding lawyers and men of great ability in
the business and other active worlds of
Canada who would enable us, surely, to perform our duties as well as others in the other
place.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Urquhart, for Hon.

COMPANY OF YOUNG CANADIANS ACT
BILL

TO

AMEND-SECOND READINGDEBATE ADJOURNED

Hon. Chesley W. Carter moved the second
reading of Bill C-176, to amend the Company
of Young Canadians Act.
He said: Honourable senators, this is the
second amendment to the Company of Young
Canadians Act since the original legislation
was introduced in the other place on May 2,
1966, by the then Prime Minister of Canada,
the Right Honourable Lester B. Pearson. To
understand the purpose and reason of the
amendment we have before us in Bill C-176,
and its relationship to the earlier amendment
passed last December, as well as to make it
meaningful to those who may read the print[Hon. Mr. Phillips (Rigaud).]

March 4, 1970

ed record of this debate, it is necessary to
recapitulate briefly the history of this legislation since its inception.
On June 10, 1966, when Prime Minister
Pearson opened the debate on second reading
of the original bill, which was then Bill
C-174, he quoted in part section 14 of the bill,
which sets forth the ojectives of the C.Y.C. as:
To support, encourage and develop programs for social, economic and community development in Canada or abroad by
voluntary service.
Enlarging on this statement of objectives, he
emphasized that he regarded it as:
-one step forward in the battle against
poverty, disease, deprivation and inequality wherever these may exist in our
country, as well as being a modest measure of assistance in meeting these problems in other countries.
He described the bill as making possible a
great adventure, and it is clear that he pictured the C.Y.C. as being patterned after
CUSO-working in a similar manner, even
working side by side with CUSO abroad, but
with the bulk of its operations confined to
Canada-and, whether at home or abroad, he
pictured the Company of Young Canadians as
being inspired at all times by that spirit of
high adventure and unselfish service that has
characterized CUSO and crowned it with
honour and respect as well as with a wide
measure of success.
Here I should like to stress that the original
bill was not hastily drawn. It was not a case
of someone getting a half-baked idea and
rushing it through into legislation without
much thought or consideration as to what was
involved or what the consequences might be.
On the contrary, it was given a tremendous
amount of thought and preliminary planning
by an organizing committee under Dr. Francis
Leddy. This committee spent practically a
whole year seeking opinions from every possible source-from federal Government departments, provincial governments, universities, voluntary agencies, youth groups and
some private citizens. These opinions were
evaluated and compiled into recommendations
which were later embodied in the original
bill. For example, the organizing committee
recommended that the C.Y.C. should have a
maximum degree of independence and flexibility on the grounds that manouverability was
necessary for the company to be able to work
in co-operation with a wide variety of groups
and agencies, both governmental and private,

March 4, 1970

SENATE DEBATES

and this principle was incorporated into the
legislation.
The committee also recommended that
provision should be made to ensure that the
experience the volunteers gained in the field
should be brought into the administrative
affairs of the company. It was to be a company not only for Canadians but of Canadians, a
company in which young Canadians themselves would play a major role in determining
plans and operations. This principle, too, was
embodied in section 4 of the original bill,
which provided for a council of 15 members,
10 of whom were to be elected by the volunteers themselves and the other five appointed
by the Governor in Council. This was
approved by all parties in the other place on
the ground that the company should be free
from government control and should have a
wide measure of autonomy.
Section 15 of the original bill sets forth the
various areas or fields in which the company
would operate and the types of activities in
which the company might engage, but the
programs and the projects included in the
programs were to be developed in response to
requests received from various organizations
and bodies, federal, provincial, municipal and
private, and were not to be undertaken on the
initiative of the company itself. The volunteers were not to be sent where, to quote Mr.
Pearson, "they would not be needed nor
welcome."
It can be seen, then, that the Company of
Young Canadians was intended to serve a
two-fold purpose. First, it was to be a means
of challenging young Canadians to come to
grips with the problems that beset us and to
do something about the inequalities and
injustices of our society. Secondly, it was to
be a means of mobilizing the youthful energies, zeal and enthusiasm of those who
accepted the challenge so that they could be
used in a concentrated manner in the service
of their country and of their fellow man.
Three years passed, and while the Company
of Young Canadians did carry out successfully a number of good useful projects, the
happy
results
and
great expectations
anticipated when the company was established were for the most part not realized.
Unfortunately, the good that the company
accomplished was overshadowed by bad publicity surrounding some of their other activities, so that large questions were raised in the
public mind concerning not only their methods but their objectives as well.
As a result, shortly after the present session
of Parliament opened in October 1969, an

order was passed in the other place in the
following terms:
Ordered,-that the Standing Committee
on Broadcasting, Films and Assistance to
the Arts be empowered to consider and
make a final report to the House, not
later than December 5, 1969, upon the
legislative framework, organization, and
operations of the Company of Young
Canadians, and that, for the purpose of
this inquiry, the committee be empowered to retain the services of counsel and
to adjourn from place to place within
Canada, and that the clerk, counsel, and
the necessary supporting staff be authorized to accompany the committee.
The committee began its inquiry October
24, 1969, and presented its report December 5,
1969. In their report the committee expressed
themuselves as being, "gravely disturbed by
many aspects of the legislation, organization
and operations of the company." They then
went on to outline specific areas of concern
such as the lack of administrative procedures,
the unconventional nature of the financial
procedures followed, and the evidence that
the company had been infiltrated and used
as a base for acts of subversion, violence
and illegality which the administrators of the
company were apparently powerless to control. They expressed concern also about the
evidence indicating that public funds may
have been surreptitiously diverted to support
these purposes, the evidence that at various
times and places some volunteers in the
course of their duties had participated in
overt acts of a partisan political nature which
was contrary to the best interests of the company, and the fact that the executive director
of the company was seriously hampered in the
performance of his duties because his position, power, authority and duties were not
sufficiently defined. The result was that the
company had no clear-cut policies with
respect to the qualifications, recruitment and
training of volunteers; no evaluation procedures with respect to the performance of
volunteers and staff or for the assessment and
termination of programs or projects; no adequate procedure to deal with the grievances
of volunteers, or staff, and no adequate polides for the suspension and dismissal of staff
and the suspension or cancellation of volunteer contracts.
To correct these defects the committee
made a number of recommendations. The
first recommendation was:
That, for a period of not more than a
year, all powers and functions hereto-

SENATE DEBATES
fore exercised by the Council and the
Executive Director be exercised under
the direction of the Trustees.

March 4, 1970

from time to time a split had developed
within the company between the volunteers,
officers and employees. The new section 3
differs from the old section only by including
the words "officer, employees and", making
it clear that officers and employees are part of
the company. This change also firmly establishes the executive director as the chief
operating officer with responsibility for volunteers as well as for employees.
Section 4 has to do with the composition of
the council. The original section 4 provided
for a council of 15 members, 10 of whom
were to be elected by the volunteer members
of the Company and the other five to be
appointed by the Governor in Council. The
new section 4 reduces the number from 15 to
a maximum of nine and a minimum of seven,
all of whom are appointed by the Governor in
Council. After serving two terms a council
member must wait until 12 months after
completing his second term before being eligible for reappointment. There has been no
change in this respect.
When this bill was being debated in the
other place, the elimination of council members elected by the volunteer members of the
Company proved to be one of the most controversial points in the whole bill. It was
argued that one of the principles in founding
the Company of Young Canadians was that
the volunteer members should participate at
all levels of decision making. Unfortunately,
this has proven unworkable. In its report the
Broadcasting Committee referred to this
aspect of section 4 in the following words:
Your committee is concerned that the
number of volunteers on the council of
the Company vis-à-vis the number of
appointed members, can distort the
objective deliberations of the Council.
Therefore, your committee suggests that
the composition of the council in this
regard be given careful consideration.

As there was evidence of a need to protect
the expenditure of public monies and to control any possible illegal activities of a few
members of the company, this recommendation was treated with great urgency and
embodied in Bill C-171, which was passed by
the House of Commons on December 17, 1969,
and by this chamber on December 19, and
given royal assent the same day.
The committee also made recommendations
with respect to the legislative framework of
the company. It is these recommendations
which are embodied in Bill C-176 which is
now before us.
You may ask why these recommendations
were not included in Bill C-171 which we
dealt with just before the Christmas recess. I
have already referred to the first reason,
which was the urgency of the need for firm
control of the administrative and financial
procedures of the company. But there was a
second reason. The committee felt that they
had not had sufficient time to evaluate adequate:y the work that had been done by
volunteers in specific projects. They felt that
not only should this be done but an opportunity should be provided for the minister to
discuss the recommended changes with the
council and executive director of the company and with other appropriate persons to the
fullest possible extent before any of the
changes were implemented.
I come now to Bill C-176 whose purpose is
to give legislative effect to the recommendations of the Commons Standing Committee on
Broadcasting, Films and Assistance to the
Arts with respect to the legislative framework
of the Company of Young Canadians. I shall
deal with each section separately.
Section 1 repeals sections 3 and 4 of the
original act and substitutes two new sections

[Hon. Mr. Carter.]

March 4, 1970

SENATE DEBATES

It should be borne in mind, however, that
the application of this section will not preclude volunteer members from having any
participation in decision making because
there is nothing in the main act or in this bill
to prevent the Governor in Council from
appointing volunteer members to the council
in the future, and there is nothing to prevent
the formation of grievance committees by the
volunteers.
Also, section 16, subsection 2, of the main
act provides for the establishment of an advisory committee which may consist of volunteer members of the company and other
persons.
Some arguments were put forward in
the other place and in committee that the
volunteer members should be allowed to elect
at least one or two of their number to the
council. It was felt, however, that this would
really be nothing more than a tokenism and
would lead to undermining the authority of
the executive director.
Another suggestion was that ex-volunteers
should be appointed, and that a definite
number should be stipulated in the law. The
answer to this was that the performance of
ex-volunteers on the permanent council was
not exceptional and it would not be practical
to tie the hands of the Government in this
way.
The Company of Young Canadians is analogous to organizations such as the National
Arts Centre and, in particular, the Canada
Council. You do not find grant recipients on
these policy boards, at least during the tenure
of their grant.
Finally, if the Government is to assume its
responsibilities for the Company of Young
Canadians, it must assume responsibilities for
the appointment of the policy board. This can
only be done if all appointments are "at
pleasure" but for fixed terms.
Some members in the other place argued
that the appointment of all members of the
council by cabinet results in "the Company of
Cabinet Canadians". The reply to this argument is that members appointed by Governor
in Coundil to similar agencies, for example,
the C.B.C., Canada Council, National Arts
Centre, et cetera, have historically proven
their
independence
after
appointment.
Though the "at pleasure" appointment effectively means that the ultimate weapon of
removal remains in the hands of the Governor in Council, nevertheless, it is a weapon
which is not traditionally used, and independence of action by members is not impaired.

Section 2 merely repeals subsection 3 of
section 6 of the main act, which has become
redundant because once this bill is passed
into law there will not be any more elected
members on the council. This amendment is
consequential on the amendments contained
in section 1, which provides that all members
of the council are to be appointed.
Section 3 repeals section 10 of the original
act and substitutes a new section therefor.
Section 10 has to do with the appointment of
an executive director. You will recall that a
few moments ago I said that the Broadcasting
Committee in the course of their inquiry
found that the executive director of the Company had been seriously hampered in the performance of his duties because his position
and authority had not been sufficiently
defined. The first paragraph of section 10 in
the original act was permissive. It merely
stated that "the Governor in Council may, on
the recommendation of the council, appoint
an executive director". The new proposed
paragraph makes it clear that there shall be
an executive director and that he is to be
appointed by the Governor in Council.
The second paragraph of section 10 outlines
the duties and authority of the executive
officer. The original act merely stated that the
executive director was responsible for the
management and supervision of the work and
staff of the Company. His relationship with
the volunteer members was therefore left
open to question. The new proposed section
makes it quite clear that the executive director has complete responsibility for the supervision of the volunteer members as well as
for the staff of the Company.
Section 4 is a very simple amendment to
section 14 of the original act. The original
section permitted the Company of Young
Canadians to engage in activities in foreign
countries. This new amendment limits their
activities to Canada only. It is felt that with
such organizations as CUSO in the field doing
such splendid work it is not logical to duplicate their efforts.
Section 5 is a simple amendment to section
15 which, as I said earlier, sets forth the
various areas or fields in which the Company
would operate and the types of activities in
which they might engage. The amendment in
section 5 is consequential on the change in
section 4. It merely deletes the two subparagraphs in section 15 which refer to work in
foreign countries and which are no longer
relevant since section 4 limits their activities
to Canada only.

March 4, 1970

SENATE DEBATES
Section 6 adds a new section 20A to
the present act. The purpose of this new section is to make Part VIII of the Financial
Administration Act applicable to the company.
Section 7 amends section 24 of the present
act. This section has to do with auditing the
accounts and financial transactions of the
company. This amendment provides for the
annual audit to be carried out by the Auditor
General instead of by an auditor appointed
by the Governor in Council as required by
the present act.
Honourable senators, there are some who
hold that the amendments contained in this
bill have effectively killed the C.Y.C. as originally conceived and that the company might
as well be abolished. Others have stated that
we should scrap the C.Y.C. and start all over
again with some new agency. I do not think
either of these views will bear serious
examination.
Numerically the young people constitute a
large part of our society and a very important
part. They have strong views as to what is
wrong with our society and a very great contribution to make in helping to put it right. In
fact, through their programs the C.Y.C. has
already demonstrated that they can contribute greatly to our society and also that they
can encourage and involve youth in achieving
its rehabilitation.
The challenges of our society still exist and
there still exists a need for some means of
enabling our young people to accept those
challenges and also for mobilizing their
youthful energies, enthusiasm and zeal in the
service of their country and their fellow
Canadians.
To abolish the Company of Young Canadians would be tantamount to saying that we
had lost faith in them completely, that we
were writing them off altogether as being
incapable of meeting those challenges or of
making any worthwhile contribution to the
solution of our problems. That would be contrary to evidence, and to condemn all our
young people because of the actions of a tiny
minority would be completely unjustified.

If we started all over again with a different
agency, since the objectives will remain
unchanged and we will be dealing with substantially the same age groups, we would inevitably wind up with a body similar to what
the C.Y.C. will be if these amendments are
passed into law. The name of the agency
might be different, but their operations and
the framework in which they would be carried out would be essentially the same.
Bill C-176 is the product of experience and
hindsight. We have learned from our mistakes
and taken steps to correct them. The bill
before us contains all the recommendations
made by the Broadcasting Committee with
respect to legislative framework except twoone which related to advisory councils and
did not require legislative action, and the
other which recommended compulsory consultation with government agencies and
which was considered too restrictive as there
may be times when the C.Y.C. will wish to
operate independent of government structures.
The amendments in Bill C-176 will go a
long way towards correcting the legislative
deficiencies in the original act. I commend it
to you for your support and rapid passage so
that the council can be appointed and normal
operations resumed. I may say that after
second reading, it is intended to refer this bill
to the appropriate committee.

APPOINTMENT

OF COMMISSIONER

Hon. Paul Martin moved:
That, in accordance with section 19 of
an act respecting the status of the officiai
languages of Canada, chapter 54, Statutes
of Canada, 1968-69, this House approves
the appointmnent of Keith Spicer, Esquire,
as Cominissioner of Officiai Languages
for Canada.
He said: Honourable senators, 1 should like
briefly to explain the legisiative framework of
21498-41

He will be, to borrow an expression fromn
the Royal Commission on Bilingualism. and
Biculturalism, a kind of linguistic ombudsman.
In order that he may carry out these duties,
the Commissioner wrnl have the power to
make investigations either on his own initiative or on account of any complaint made to
him. to the effect that the status of an officiai
language is not being recognized or where the
spirit of the act is not being complied with in
any of the federai institutions.
Following bis investigation, the Commissioner will report to the appropriate officiai,

SENATE DEBATES
and he has the discretion, if action is not
forthcoming that lie considers adequate, to
make his report to Parliament.
In addition, the Commissioner is instructed
to make an annual report to Parliament
reviewing the year's work.
[English]
I am sure that Mr. Spicer is more than
adequately qualified to perform the duties
which are outlined in the act and which will,
if he is appointed, become his responsibilities.
Mr. Spicer was educated at the University
of Toronto and the University of Paris, and
holds graduate degrees in political science
from both institutions. He bas taught at the
University of Ottawa, University of Toronto,
Dartmouth College and York University, and
is presently Associate Professor of Political
Science at Glendon College at York University. He has published extensively on the subject of external aid in both English and
French. He has also served as a researcher
with the Royal Commission on Bilingualism
and Biculturalism, and since 1961 has been a
commentator on the French network of the
Canadian Broadcasting Corporation.
In my judgment and that of the Government, Mr. Spicer is an example of an English
Canadian who has studied extensively in the
French language and French culture, and is
perfectly bilingual. In this sense be is an ideal
person to carry out the important responsibilities that I have mentioned. The Government, therefore, puts forward his name in
order that his nomination may be approved at
this time. I am grateful to the Leader of the
Opposition for his willingness to second this
motion.

Hon. Jacques Flynn: Honourable senators,
the Official Languages Act was passed with
the agreement of all senators last year. Personally, I was very pleased with the unanimous decision because I had always been concerned about the fact that the British North
America Act, as drafted in 1867, reflected
only a, let us say, temporary situation. The
changes that have taken place since that time
justify, at least in the field under federal
jurisdiction, that both the French and the
English languages be considered equal.
Now, in application of the act, it is appropriate to choose a Commissioner of Official
Languages whose appointment was provided
for in section 19 (1) of the act, which was
[Hon. Mr. Martin.]

March 5, 1970

quoted by the Leader of the Government, and
reads as follows:
There shall be a Commissioner of Official
Languages for Canada, hereinafter in this
act called the Commissioner.
Here is the second paragraph:
The Commissioner shall be appointed by
commission under the Great Seal after
approval of the appointment by resolution of the Senate and House of
Commons.
The third paragraph is as follows:
Subject to this section, the Commissioner
holds office during good behavior for a
term of seven years, but may be removed
by the Governor in Council at any time
on address of the Senate and House of
Commons.
In other words, the same concept which
applies to judges.
As to the specific responsibilities of the
Commissioner, they are given in sections 25
and 26 of the act. I shall quote section 25 in
full and section 26 in part. Here is section 25:
It is the duty of the Commissioner to take
all actions and measures within his
authority with a view to ensuring recognition of the status of each of the official
languages and compliance with the spirit
and intent of this act in the administration of the affairs of the institutions of
the Parliament and government of
Canada and, for that purpose, to conduct
and carry out investigations either on his
own initiative or pursuant to any complaint made to him and to report and
make recommendations with respect
thereto as provided in this act.
Subsection (1) of section 26 reads as
follows:
Subject to this act, the Commissioner
shall investigate any complaint made to
him to the effect that, in any particular
instance or case,
(a) the status of an official language
was not or is not being reccgnized, or
(b) the spirit and intent of this act was
not or is not being complied with
in the administration of the affairs of any
of the institutions of the Parliament or
government of Canada.
Of course, we are talking about the duties
of the Commissioner and I shall add that Mr.
Keith Spicer's qualifications as listed by the
Government Leader and also in the other

House of Commons Hansard-are obvious. In
my opinion, he has for the very delicate
duties he will have to fuifill, a background, an
experience, and 1 should say a mind which
stemns from his qualifications. We can be confident that he will be the interpreter as the act
says, flot only of the letter but also of the

to support tis motion.

Honourable senators, as I have s'aid, the
Officiai Languages Act was passed unanimously by tis house last year. In accordance
with section 19 o! that act we are today called
upon to ratify the choice of the Government
in the person of Mr. Keith Spicer as Commissioner of Languages. He appears to be fully
qualified for this very difficuit and delicate
function. It will be an interesting experience
to watch him exercise these responsibilities. I
arn hopeful, as I arn sure ail members of this

his responsibilities in accordance not only
with the letter but also with the spirit of the

INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT
RESEARCH CENTRE BILL
SECOND READINO-DEBATE

CONTINUED

The Senate resumed from Wednesday,
Mardi 4, the adjourned debate on the motion
of Hon. Mr. Martin for the second reading of
Bill C-12, to establish the International Developrnent Research Centre.
Hon. Allisier Grosart: Honourable senators,
this bill was fully explained to us yesterday
by the Leader of the Government. I compliment him on his explanation and again on the
major role he lias played ini bringing about
the development of what will be a very
important Canadian institution in the field of
international aid. May I add that, as usual, he
has i his explanation made the bill look
rather better than it is.
The bill deals with two aspects o! Canadian
public policy with which members of this
21498-4Uh

chamber are very familiar. One is international in scope, being the external aid program; the other is the broad subject of our
own national research and development poidies and efforts. The latter lias been studied
by Senator Lamontagne's committee in great
detail over the last year and a haîf, and the
former, the question of external aid, albeit
limited somewhat to the area o! the Caribbean, is currently before the Standing Senate
Committee on Foreign Affairs.
The subject matter of the bill is the provision of a larger capacity and capability for
research and development on the problems o!
the underdeveloped countries of the world. I
think ail honourable senators will agree that
the upgrading of the level of researchi and
development activity that can be applied to
the problems of these countries is long
overdue.
Perhaps I can do no better than quote the
words of the Secretary o! State for External
Affairs when introducing the bill. He said:
The gap between the low income and
the wealthier nations of the world is to a
large extent a science and technology
gap.
0f course, this lias been echoed by everyone
who has studied this particular problem.
May I also quote an expert who is very
familiar to honourable senators, Mr. Maurice
Strong, President of CIDA, the Canadian
International Development Agency. He said:
-if there is anything that distinguishes
the more industrialized countries from
the less developed countries, it is the
extent to which the fruits of science and
technology have been applled to the process o! production.
On the other hand, in the less developed nations the effects of teclinological
change have been rather different.
Mr. Strong went on to give some examples o!
that and pointed out that modern science and
technology in the health and medical fields
have had the effect o! prolonging the hifespan
i these countries, and tis lias been one of
the causes of the current population explosion, the effects of which have been to negate
to some extent the effect of the rise in the
GNP of those countries.
Rath er interestingly, he also pointed out
that science and technology have resulted in
the development in the developed countries of
such things as synthetics, and their effect on
developing countries lias been to create substitu t es for many o! their primary productsý

SENATE DEBATES
So, the world, and particularly the developed
nations, is faced with the problem that the
more we succeed in a material way the larger
we make the gap between us and that other
half of the world which is said to go to bed
hungry every night.
I think we can all appreciate the necessity
of help such as this bill contemplates in tackling this problem, when we recall our own
problem. Canada is an advanced, industrialized country. We are spending this year perhaps $1 billion in the public and private sectors on Research and Development, and yet if
there is any conclusion that would seem to be
readily drawn from the evidence we have
heard in the Science Policy Committee, it is
that we are not doing enough; that $1 billion-of which $600,000 is federal Government funding-is not enough for Canada to
spend to stay in the science and technology
race. On the other hand, I am sure that $1
billion is much more than is being spent for
the sarne purpose by all the low-income,
developing nations. That raw fact seems to
me to point up the seriousness of the problem
facing the developing nations in this area of
what I call the science and technology race.
This bill offers an initiative by Canada in
this important field. The Government and
Canadians generally are entitled to take some
pride in the fact that in a way we are the
first to take the initiative. If this centre is set
up-as no doubt it will be under this bill-it
will be the only institute of its kind in the
world. There are some which have certain
similarities, but there is none so clearly dedicated to the specific purpose of upgrading the
science and technology capability of these
developing countries.
The bill proposes an expenditure of five per
cent of our external aid budget. This is a
generous sum but, unfortunately, when it is
compared with what should be our contribution and that of all the other developed
nations, it is clearly not enough. The United
Nations Advisory Comnmittee on the application of science and technology recommends 10
per cent. The Pearson Commission which
recently reported suggests that it should be
five per cent not merely of all of our external
aid budget but of our total national expenditure in Research and Development. As I have
said, our total national expenditure is $600
million, and, according to my arithmetic, the
requirement to meet the Pearson Commission's recommendation would be $30 million
this year. The amount contemplated in this
bill is $30 million over a five-year period.
[Hon. Mr. Grosart.]

March 5, 1970

I make these comparisons not to criticize
the amounts that we are asked to vote
today-we are making a start, and it is better
to make a slow start than no start at all. We
are, I hope, setting an example to some other
developed countries. At least, this year we are
increasing our own external aid program by
some $25 million. It is a small amount but it
is at least an increase at a time when regrettably other countires, and particularly the
United States, are decreasing their total
external aid allotments.
Honourable senators, as I say, there are
reasons why we should take some satisfaction
from endorsing this bill and its principle, but
there will be some criticisms made. They will
be made by those who know most about
external aid, namely, those who need it most.
It is always difficult, I think, for donor countries to assimilate gracefully the criticisms of
recipients of aid. We find that in our private
lives-certainly, it is so in the public sector.
But I mention four possible criticisms that
will be directed at us, and there may be many
more. I do so for two reasons. First, we
should avoid any complacency in our thinking, and any idea that by making this important gesture we are doing all we can do
towards solving this very vital problem of
research and development in the developing
countries. The second reason is that if these
criticisms that will come are considered in
advance, then perhaps those who will have
the direction of this program will be prevented from falling into some of the more obvious
pitfalls that are in the path of any such institution as this.
The four criticisms that will come are
these: (1) that the centre is to be located in
Canada; (2) that there is built into it an element of tied aid; (3) that there is a very great
danger that the amounts to be voted under
this bill will be subtracted in the long run
from our total CIDA budget; and (4) the
almost excessive insistence in the bill upon
complete Canadian domination of this board.
I hasten to say that I recognize the reasons
for these stipulations in the setting up of this
centre. Let me take first the location in
Canada. My first impression when I heard of
this proposal was that the ideal thing would
be for Canada to set up at least four international development research centres. We
could set up one in the Carribbean, one in
East Africa, one in West Africa, and another
perhaps in Southeast Asia. I am still not quite
convinced that that would not be the best
way of doing it, and the reasons are obvious.
This would mean a Canadian presence Ln

March 5, 1970

Marc 5, 970SENATE
DEBATES

these countries. We would be there on the
spot, doing sornething to help.
Senator Connolly (Ottawa West) has often
called to our attention the importance of this
in connection with the work of voluntary
agencies. There is certainly plenty of evidence
that, by and large, the vol.untary agencies
have often been more acceptable in these
countries with the type of operation they
carry on than the publie and national institutions there.
However, I bow to sorne of the experts who
have considered this very carefully, and who
seem to have reached the conclusion that for
the tirne being, at least, there are good reasons why the centre should be iocated in
Ottawa. However, the bill before us does not
require that. The original draft of the bill did,
but the committee of the other place amended
it so that it is possible for the Board of Directors to decide to locate elsewhere, possibly in
Montreal. By sayîng that I arn in favour of
its being located in Ottawa, I do flot mean
that I arn as "centraliste" as the distinguished
chaîrman of the Special Cornmittee of the
Senate on Science Policy, but Professor
Taylor of the Geography Departmnent of
Carleton University has made a very strong
case for the location of the centre in Ottawa,
and 1 arn rather inclined for the time being to
agree that this is where it should be.
Honourabie senators are well aware of the
fact that there is no aspect of our external
aid that is more subject to criticism than the
fact that it is tied. "Tied" aid means, of
course, that we seek in our largesse to retain
the maximum Canadian benefit. Experts have
estimated that the dollar-cost of the tying of
aid is somewhere between 15 and 20 per cent
of the f.o.b. value of that aid. Criticism is
certainly understandable, because recipient
countries naturally ask: Why, when you are
helping us, do you insist on helping us with
Canadian goods and Canadian people when in
many cases we can buy the goods cheaper
elsewhere, and perhaps get better people elsewhere? The criticismn is there, and we have
lived with it in spite of the fact that every
international agency that has looked at this
question has recommended strongly to ahl
donor nations that they abandon the pninciple
of tied aid.
I regret to say that I flnd the concept of tied
aid certainly inherent in this bill, if not
implicit, and in sorne of the staternents that
have been mnade. The Secretary of State for
External Affairs in his introduction of the bill
spoke, for example, of the spin-off of the
rnoney that might go to Canadian universities

and to Canadian institutions. I hope, honourable senators, that that will be a very srnall
spin-off, although I have no doubt that the
centre will be under great pressure from
Canadian institutions, commercial and otherwise, for their share of whatever amount is
spent annualiy.
It would seem of the utmnost importance
that these research funds be spent in the
countries we are endeavouring to assist. I amn
fully aware that in ail the arguments we must
consider public opinion in Canada. We must
say, "Yes, we are giving this rnoney, but do
not forget we are keeping a little for ourselves." This is said to be the main argument.
We must tie aid if we are going to convinoe
the Canadian public that we should do this
good thing. I would have preferred to have
seen the Governrnent bolder in this case and
a littie more ready to accept its responsibility.
The tirne has corne when we should say to
the Canaclian public, "Do you believe i this,
yes or no? If you say no external. aid, let us
have no external, aid." We shouid, as soon as
we can, get away from this halfway measure,
this business of saying we are going to keep a
little for ourselves. We do not need to. In
terms of our problerns and the problems of
other nations we do not have to save 10, 20,
30, 40 or 50 per cent of the rnoney that we
are extending i aid to these nations. We can
afford it.
There are other arguments in favour of tied
aid, but rnost of thern have been negatived ini
the developing processes in this field.
The element of the tying of aid may very
well defeat some of the major objectives of
this bill. Certainly it will dilute the dollar
value of the benefit. To the extent that it
adds to our own Canadian competence ini R
& D, it wîhl lessen the extent of the objective
of increasing the competence ln other countries. This is a very important point. It is not;
enough for us to transfer scientific and technological resources frorn Canada and plant
thern in these countries. It is infinitely more
important that we build up a competence in
those countries. We will not do that if we are
going to insist on tying this aid as we tied our
$200 million or $300 million of external aid
generally. 0f course, the tying of aid leaves
us open again to the criticism of self interest.
The developing nations of the world think we
have done pretty well in handling our own
self-interest. The tirne has corne when we
should forget about that self -interest. The
Good Book says that the Lord loveth a cheerfui giver. A cheerful giver in my book is one
who gives the bundie.

DEBATES
Marc 5. 970SENATE

useful innovation to have a joint meeting of
the two competent committees to consider
this bill.
Hon. Mr. Martin: It was certainly my
intention to move that it be referred to the
Standing Senate Comimittee on Foreign
Affairs, but we can give some thought to the
Senator's suggestion.
Hon. John J. Connolly: Honourable senators, this is a very important subi ect and is
growing in importance of late; certainly, it is
one that cannot be discussed completely in a
short period of time. For that reason I
propose to mention only a few ideas that
came to me as I listened to Senator Grosart's
speech this afternoon. We recognize his great
interest in the field of foreign aid and the
work hie has been doing in the Special Committee on Science Poiicy. His experience and
interests have contributed greatiy to the discussion of this measure.
The bill seemns to emphasize the importance
of making available more and more technology to the third world, to the underdeveloped,
or perhaps I should more properly cail them
the developing countries. We should keep in
mind that while the problems and resuits of
research apply to the difficulties of developing
countries, we experience this precise problem
among the developed countries of the world.
The reports that emanate from OECD indicate that the technological status of the
twenty or so developed countries who are
members of OECD countries is anything but
uni! orm. It is a great problem to try to bring
some of the less technologically-advanced
developed countries up to the level of the
most
technologically-advanced
developed
country, namely, the United States.
SSince the war great strides have been made
by some countries. I refer particularly to the
Japanese and German experience in this field.
I also think especially o! such things as space
activity and modern weaponry. Behind the
Iron Curtain the Russians have done a great
deal technologically, and we ail wish that
their technology could be applied primarily to
peaceful rather than military purposes.
The institution contemplated in the bill will
be a very useful tool for ail countries who are
urged to participate in foreign aid programs.
Mr. Pearson's study "Partners in Development" indicates that the gap between the
developing and the developed countries is not
only great but is growing. That is true i

relative terms. In absolute ternis a considerable advance has been made since the aid programs began, and I think many of the socalled backward, underdeveloped, deveioping
countries have made great strides since then.
I hope we ail appreciate that, while everything we would like to see accomplished has
flot been realized, the money has not ail gone
down the drain; it has not ail been wasted,
although there may have been waste. But
there is waste in everything, even in technological and scientific development. Sometimes
projects have got off the ground and vast
amounts of money have been spent on them
in the developed coi.mtries-we may have
examples of that in Canada-but some of
these projects will not succeed. Maybe some
foresight and courage should be shown i
terminating projects of that kind. This will
appiy, of course, in the aid programs.
When people taik about aid they speak
primarily of contributions to be made by the
public sector. To my mind, the importance of
the private sector cannot be over-emphasized.
If a country through whatever kind of aid it
gets reaches or approaches the take-off point,
it seems to me that the private sector can do
much to stimulate real development ia that
country. We have heard examples o! that
fi-cm witnesses who have appeared before the
Standing Senate Comnxittee on Foreign
Aiffairs.
Difficulties are now arising from the establishment o! iavestmnent in underdeveloped
countries. There is a growing resentment, of
which we have had evidence from many
quarters, and which we see in the press,
against the entry of the multi-national or
foreign corporation into the business structure of the developing countries. Sometimes
this resentment arises from a super-nationalistic feeling. That is perhaps natural to expect
from a new country, a country that begins to
be proud of its new-found independence. But
there may be other factors, perhaps racial,
perhaps economic, a feeling of the rich patroniziag the poor, creating resentment, and in
many cases leading to violence and riots. This
problem will get worse before it gets better,
and I would hope that an organization such as
that contemplated by this legisiation will
have social scientists available to give advice
in this respect.
I recail with interest that a !ew years ago I
had the privilege o! atteading a meeting o!
the O.E.C.D., held for the O.E.C.D. ministers
of science, wherein they discussed the relative
level of technology in the developed world.

SENATE DEBATES
The Secretary General-whose name regrettably escapes me at the moment-was, in my
opinion, one of the great men of the world.
That gentleman, a social scientist, said that
all the discussion in the course of the debate
which lasted for three or four days was on
a scientific level, and he felt that the influence of the ideas of the social scientists must
be felt at all times, as well as the work of
the economists and the political scientists. I
think this is a highly important point for an
organization such as the one envisaged here
to consider.
I notice in clause 4 subclause 1(a) of the bill
that there is power to enlist the talents of
natural and social scientists and technologists
of other countries. What Senator Grosart said
about the centralization of this work in
Canada may be justifiable as a form of criticism, but perhaps not now. I am glad to see
this initiative taken by Canada because I
think it is an important world initiative, and
by taking it Canada is leading public opinion.
The World Bank led public opinion, because
after all, it is a monetary agency. Yet, it
commissioned the Pearson Study on the problem of aid. This is another example of leadership which I feel is highly important at this
particular time. While at the present time the
bill requires that the officers and most of the
governors be Canadians, I hope eventually
there will be a mixture of Canadians and
eminent people from other countries, whether
they be developed or developing, as members
of the board.
I would like to go further than that. Senator Grosart has said that he regrets to see
that the CIDA budget is going to be eaten
into. I think the explanatory note indicates
that it will cost $1 million to establish this
organization. We probably can ill afford to
reduce the amount of our foreign aid by $1
million and continue the work that CIDA
should do.

financing the work. I think they will benefit if
they do so.
Hon. Mr. Martin: And let us hope that the
Canadian private sector is also willing to
help.
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): Yes. The
Canadian private sector perhaps could help
too. But I would like to see other countries
help endow this work-nations which are
expected to give aid, who want to give aid
and will give more aid, absolutely speaking
than we do. We are a relatively small contributor in the field of aid in the public
sector. I would hope that other countries
would take an active interest in this work
and help to finance it so that it can be conducted on a very high plane.
I agree with what Senator Grosart said
about tied aid. In my opinion tied aid certainly increases the cost to the country that is
getting it, and in some cases they resent it.
Hon. Mr. Martin: This brings a point to my
mind. I know Senator Connolly is very familiar with this bill, but section 19 was designed
to take into account possible assistance to the
centre by the private sector in this country.

Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): I
appreciate the intervention of the Leader of
the Government in that respect. I think this is
a very worth while section, and will enable
the private sector to get receipts for donations
to this organization, as if they were for charitable, religious or similar purposes. But I do
think that a greater amount of money could
corne from the participation of governments
of other countries who are concerned with the
general problem of aid.
I return to the question of tied aid because
despite the fact that I agree with almost
everything Senator Grosart has said, I think
the political facts of life in Canada are such
Hon. Mr. Martin: We are actually going to that even though it looks as if we are being
selfish about the production that is to go out
increase it.
in the form of aid materials manufactured in
Hon. Mr. Connolly (O±Iawa West): In the Canada, it does provide for certain benefits
normal course of events I think this is proba- here in the way of employment and the develbly true, but I rather doubt that the increase opment of new
techniques, and even an acwould be as much as $1 million. Perhaps it
may be-I do not know. I am no longer privy ceptance by public opinion of the value of
to the secrets of the Government, but I am foreign aid programs. The day may come
glad to hear that. I would hope that this when the aid will be untied, and when Govorganization could be established not only ernment will not be encumbered with finanupon a solid ground but in a way that would cial problems which make it difficult to balgive it pre-eminence in the international field ance budgets and reduce taxes. I am prepared
so that other nations who are concerned with to accept tied aid. Generally speaking, I think
the problem would be willing to help in Canadians are prepared to accept it, even
[Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West).]

SENATE DEBATES

March 5, 1970

though there are objections to it, as Senator
Grosart has explained.
This bill represents a fine Canadian initiative, and whether it comes from Canada or
not does not matter. It is a worthy initiative,
because the matter of giving aid, the quality
and quantity of aid, and the place to which it
is to be directed has become a technique in
itself. It is a problem that besets people, not
only in the public but in the private sector. I
feel that a good deal of the technique of this
kind of work can be accomplished by an
organization such as the one now proposed.
One might ask why this is not being done
at the United Nations, or why it is not being
done under some international auspices. Well,
the international auspices have not always
been able to measure up to the specific problems which I hope that this particular organization will attempt to tackle. If it succeeds in
making that kind of a contribution to the
general problem of the provision of aid, then
I think it will have been, as I believe it is
now, a very worthy contribution by a country
anxious to play its full part in the aid
programs.
Motion agreed to and bill read the second
time.
REFERRED TO COMMITTEE

The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, when shall this bill be read the third
time?
Hon. Mr. Martin: I move that this bill be
referred to the Standing Senate Committee on
Foreign Affairs. I have not had an opportunity to give consideration to the suggestion
made by Senator Grosart and therefore I
have no alternative at this time but to move
that it be sent to that committee.
Motion agreed to.
GRAIN
SEPARATE ACCOUNT FOR 1968-69 DURUM
WHEAT-PAYMENT OF SURPLUS EARNINGS
TO PRODUCERS

Leave having been given to revert to
Motions:
Hon. Hazen Argue, pursuant to notice,
moved:
That, in the opinion of the Senate, the
Government of Canada and the Canadian
Wheat Board should take all necessary
steps to keep the 1968-69 Durum pool
account separate frorn al other grain
accounts and to assure that all surplus
earnings from the sale of Durum be paid
to the producers of Durum.
21498-42

He said: Honourable senators, I am pleased
to move this motion at this time before
the Senate, seconded by Hon. Senator McDonald, that the Government take action
to remove what would otherwise be a grave
injustice to the producers of Durum wheat,
by taking action to make certain that the
surplus which has been achieved by the sale
of Durum wheat will in fact be paid to the
producers.
I am pleased to be able to inforrn the
Senate that a matter of half an hour ago or
less the minister without portfolio in charge
of the Canadian Wheat Board, the Honourable Otto Lang, announced in the House
of Commons that action was being taken
by the Government through an item in the
Estimates to make certain that this particular
thing be done.
I wish to congratulate without reservation
Mr. Lang and the Government for having
taken what I consider to be justifiable
action in announcing that an appropriate item
is being placed in the Estimates. I have no
doubt that when this item reaches the Senate,
we will give it our own full approval.
In addition to congratulating the minister
without portfolio, I would like in the Senate
to congratulate also a member of the House
of Commons, Mr. A. B. Douglas, member for
Assiniboia, who has taken great leadership
with reference to this particular question and
has, I am certain, had a real measure of influence in seeing that this has been brought
about.
I myself took an interest in this for some
time, and as long ago as January 28 of this
year I issued a press release in which I
endeavoured to point out the reasons why
this kind of action by the Government was
justified.
Hon. Mr. Martin: May I say that the senator who is now speaking and Senator McDonald sought to impress on me the importance
of this matter; so they, too, deserve some
credit.
Hon. Mr. Argue: I am sure it follows
beyond question that the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Hon. Mr. Martin) was
an active and influential voice within the
cabinet supporting this proposition. I have no
doubt that this is a fact.
Hon. Mr. Martin: I would have to say that
that is a slight exaggeration.

SENATE DEBATES
Hon. Mr. Argue: Our leader is too modest.
On Monday I phoned the secretary of the
Saskatchewan Wheat Pool to discuss this and
other questions, and he said he had just listened to our leader discuss, at a luncheon in
Regina, the importance of national unity. I
gathered he was just as highly impressed by
the speech our leader delivered in Regina as
we all are when he makes a speech in the
Senate.
Under the circumstances I might make a
short statement now as to why I feel the
Government was justified and why I am certain the Senate will be pleased that this
action has been taken. Throughout the history of the Canadian Wheat Board, hard red
spring wheat and Durum wheat have in fact
been kept separate. They have been kept
separate just as oats and barley have been
kept separate. Furthermore, when the Wheat
Board Act was first enacted by Parliament,
there was an oversight in the draftsmanship
of the act. It was not specifically provided
that Durum wheat and spring wheat as such
would be kept separately. As honourable
senators well know, because of the general
collapse of wheat prices in the world, the
Wheat Board, in its sales effort, suffered a
very substantial loss in the wheat account.
Without any separation in this account, what
was in fact a surplus in the Durum wheat
account would have been used to partially
offset the deficit in the spring wheat account,
and the Durum producers would have suffered accordingly.
As no doubt honourable senators knowand as Senator Paterson well knows-Durum
is different from hard spring wheat. Hard
spring wheat is basically used for bread.
Durum is used chiefly in the production of
macaroni and spaghetti, an entirely different
type of food. That is why it is justified that
these accounts be separate.
I have the annual Wheat Board accounts
going back through the history of the Canadian Wheat Board, and in every single case, in
every single year, the Durum wheat and hard
spring wheat were kept separate. Of course, it
was easy to keep them separate because there
was a surplus in the spring wheat account
and there was a surplus in the Durum wheat
account and appropriate payments were
made.
The production of Durum wheat is a specialty operation. It is more difficult to produce
than spring wheat, and takes longer in the
growing season. Ordinarily its yield is less
than that of spring wheat, and farmers usually have greater difficulty handling it.
[Hon. Mr. Martin.]

March 5, 1970

The Producers' Association has made a
splendid contribution to the Canadian economy by producing a specialty crop with a specialty market over and above the market for
spring wheat. By producing this specialty
group over the years, in the vast majority of
years in which they have been selling Durun
wheat, they have received a premium price.
This year they, too, will be receiving a premium price, because they have produced what,
in fact, is a premium grain.
There is a great deal of ill feeling on the
prairies stemming from the present critical
grain situation. There is talk of separatism.
Whether you wish to think the feeling is real
or fictitious, there is a good deal of talk of
alienation and separatism. It would have been
a grave mistake for the Government and for
Parliament to have failed to deal with this
question, because the producers of Durum
wheat felt, I think rightly, that the money
earned from the sale of Durum wheat
belonged to them and to nobody else. Just
because of a mistake made years ago in the
draftsmanship of the original Canadian
Wheat Board Act, they should not be penalized. So this is a very positive step the Government is taking to correct what would otherwise have been a very grave injustice.
I know that in this chamber we have supported this action, and I am certain it will
receive the overwhelming support of the
House of Commons. I might add that a Saskatchewan member of the provincial legislature, Mr. George Leith, M.L.A., placed on the
order paper in that legislature a motion similar to this. This is another indication that the
demand for this kind of action was widespread and was felt justifiable, and I am sure
that all of us will approve what the Government has done.
I feel that the work done in this chamber
and the debates that take place here have an
important bearing on government action.
Hon. Mr. Martin: I will give you a good
example of that: the proposal of the senator
himself (Hon. Mr. Argue) with regard to lowering the voting age.
Hon. Mr. Argue: My leader reminds the
Senate of the motion I put some time ago
asking for a reduction of the voting age.
Action is now being taken concerning that,
and I am certain that by the next federal
election Canadians 18 years of age will have
the federal franchise.
Some years ago I promoted in this chamber
a proposition that nearly every experienced

March 5. 1970

Marc 5. 970SENATE
DEBATES

senator said to me was an impossibility,
namely, that the contractors who had lost 50
much money in the building of the Great
Slave Lake Railway should have the circumstances of their losses looked into with the
expectation that action would be taken to
help thern recover some of their huge losses.
Honourable senators of much greater experience than I had told me that it, would be
impossible to have such an inquiry, that it
would be opening up a "whole can of worms".
They said it was something the Goverment
would not likely consider. I was pleased that
a comrnittee of the House of Commons considered the question and presented a motion
to the Commons asking the Government to
undertake a special inquiry into the situation.
I amn pleased to learn that as the days go by
there is definite action towards havtag that
inquiry take place. I arn convinced that that
motion in the Senate and the support it was
given by honourable senators on both sides of
the house materially assisted those la the
other place who were also asking that the
same thing be done.
As I said at the beginning of my remarks, I
congratulate the Government without reservation for having announced an important
step that will be welcomed by the wheat producers of western Canada. It is a good indication that the Government is able to look at an
injustice and correct it.
Hon..Arthur M. Pearson: Honourable senators, I have but few words to say on this
motion by Senator Argue.
Ini the first place, I should say that the
congratulations are due to, Senator Argue
rather than to the Governaient. Several governiments have been in power stace the inception of the Canadian Wheat Board Act in 1935,
but, with respect to this particular point,
nothtag has been done by any of themn until
now, when Senator Argue, one of those wideawake young westerners, has discovered the
discrepancy in the act. It is due to, his efforts
that we have this imminent change. 1 suppose
the minister saw the motion on the Order
Paper here and acted upon it. From that
point of view I congratulate hlmn for acting at
this time. However, it is most surprising that
siace 1935, when this particular legisiation
was first enacted-in other words, for the last
35 years-this discrepancy in the drafting of
the bull has gone unnoticed.
Section 25(l)(a) of the Canadian Wheat
Board Act, which is found in chapter 44 of
21498--42ý

the Revised Statutes of Canada, 1952, says
that the Board shal
(a) buy ail wheat produced in the
designated area, offered by a producer
for sale and deliveryYou will notice that it says "ail wheat". Paragraph (b) of that subsection specifles certain
sums for the grade No. 1 Manitoba Northern.
Now, anybody who has had anything toi
do with farming knows that No. 1 Manitoba
Northern is not Durumn wheat. The indication
is that they meant at that time that it was
only No. 1 or spring wheat that they were
talking about and flot Durum wheat. But if
you go further you wiil see another item about
oats and barley, showing that they did distinguish between the different grains. But in the
first instance they said "ail wheat", thereby
mixing the Durum wheat with the No. 1
Manitoba Northern wheat, without distinguishing between the two.
This is a correction long overdue and I
congratulate Senator Argue for pointing it
out.
Hon. A. Hamilton McDonald: Honourable
senators, Senator Argue discussed this motion
with me sorne time ago and I agreed to second
it. I had made some notes that might have
been more applicable had it not been for the
answer to a question that was put in the
House of Commons only a few short minutes
ago. The arguments are perhaps not relevant
at the moment. However, 1 do want to give
credit to Senator Argue, ta the minister in
charge of the Canadian Wheat Board, ta the
member for Assiniboia and others who have
f elt that it was only because of an oversight
in the drafting of the original act that the
Canadian Wheat Board was placed in the
position for the crop year 1968-69, where in
fact under the act they were not able to make
a final payaient on wheat unless there was a
surplus in the total wheat accotant. And, as
Senator Argue and Senator Pearson have
pomnted out, there is a surplus in the Durum
wheat account, even though there is a deficit
in the hard spring wheat account.
I can lUy appreciate the fact that the
Durum producer should receive his final payment regardless of the fact that there is a
defit in the total wheat account. As Senator
Argue has pointed out in this chamber, in
respect of the total area of western Canada,
the Durum wheat producers are to be found
only in certain areas of western Canada
owing to the fact that the total area is not
suited to the production of Durum wheat. But

SENATE DEBATES
many people who are in marginal areas have
turned to the production of Durum wheat: (a)
in the hope that they would be able to sell a
greater quantity of their production; and
(b)-though not necessarily in this order-to
help out with the surplus of hard spring
wheat. I think it would have been an extreme
injustice to have taken money that belongs to
Durum producers and to have kept it in the
general wheat account because there was a
deficit in the account for hard spring wheat.
I congratulate those who have made the
effort and the Government for having taken
the step they have today in announcing there
will be an item in the Estimates to cover a
final payment which is the Durum producers'
own money.
I want to impress on my friends in other
parts of Canada that it is not the Canadian
taxpayers' money or the money of the producers of hard spring wheat in Canada, but it
is the money of the producers of Durum; and
to have taken it into the general account to
offset losses in hard spring wheat would have
been nothing short of thievery, in my opinion.
However, it means the act must be amended
in order to make the payment, and I hope it
will be a permanent and not a temporary
change.
This payment will be very helpful to the
economy of western Canada. I am not certain
of the amount of money involved, but it could
be between $5 million and $6 million. I am
sure all senators are aware of the economic
situation in the Prairie provinces, and especially in my home Province of Saskatchewan,
because Saskatchewan is more dependent
upon agriculture, and especially upon the production of wheat, than the other Prairie provinces or any other part of Canada. This payment will mean a great deal to the economy
of Saskatchewan as well as to the economy of
the Durum producers. This injection of money
into our economy will have beneficial effects
not only on the farmers but also on the local
governments and business generally in these
provinces. This, together with the program
announced by the Government a few days
ago concerning wheat acreage reduction-a
payment of $6 an acre for fallow in 1970 or
$10 if kept out of production until July 1,
1971-will be helpful. I am not sure whether
the Government and the Canadian Wheat
Board will meet the target of reduction of 20
million acres-in fact, I do not think they
will; but if we can take half of that amount
out of production, then I think that in the
long run it will be of great benefit not only to
[Hon. Mr. McDonald.]

March 5, 1970

the Saskatchewan farmer but to the total
economy of Saskatchewan and this nation.
We need only look back a few months to
see the point in time when huge wheat sales
coming out of the Prairie region of Canada
saved this nation as far as the international
balance of payments is concerned.
Hon. Mr. Martin: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. McDonald: In my opinion, the
production of wheat is no different from the
production of any other commodity, and we
have found that, when industry produces
beyond the ability of the markets at home
and abroad to absorb the fruits of their
labours, industry shuts down its factories.
What is the automobile industry doing today?
It is closing its plants for days, weeks or
months, as the case may be, simply because
there are more automobiles on the factory
lots and in the hands of the distributors and
agents than the market will absorb. Producers
of other raw materials, especially mines, have
taken similar steps, and I think this is a
proper step for Canada to take at this time.
For this program to be effective, our major
competitors-namely, the United States, Australia and western Europe-must also take
some land out of production. I am a little
tired of listening te some fuzzy-headed socialists talking about taking land out of production when half the people of the world are
going to bed at night hungry. They have been
going to bed hungry for a long time when we
have had surplus products, but to date the
problem has been that no system has been
devised whereby it is possible to get the surplus here into the hands of the hungry
abroad.
A few years ago I had an opportunity to
visit India, and at that time many millions of
Indians were going to bed hungry. You did
not need to ascertain that fact through conversations with anyone; all you needed to do
was look at the deformity of human bodies
because of the lack of food; and yet there was
Canadian wheat rotting on the docks in India.
Why? Because the hungry people of India, in
many instances, were living from 500 to 1,500
miles away from the docks and there was no
transportation system-railroads, highways or
other-to take the food where it was needed.
So, this is the major problem, the distribution of surplus foods from many areas to
the hungry areas of the world.
Let us not be blinded by people saying they
believe we should continue to over-produce

March 5, 1970

SENATE DEBATES

because there are hungry people in the world.
I repeat, if you are going to feed the hungry,
you must have a transportation systern to
move grain and other foodstuffs from places
of over-supply to areas in the world where
the hungry live. This problem has not yet
been solved.
In one of the debates that took place earlier
today, concerning foreign aid, it was said that
we can do a great deal to solve that problem
by producing surplus commodities in Canada,
but if we are not able to move them out of
our own nation it is not going to feed the
hungry peoples of the world.
I give credit, not only to all those who have
played a part in obtaining the final payment
for producers of Dururn in western Canada,
but also to those who have advocated a program of acreage production to get our production down to levels where it will meet the
demands of importing nations. I am confident
that it will do a great deal, not only for the
Prairie provinces and Canada but also for
world trade, provided we are able to obtain
the co-operation of other major producers of
wheat products around the world; I give my
wholehearted support to this and other programs announced in the last few days.
Hon. Paul Martin: Honourable senators,
when I came into this chamber this afternoon
I had no idea I would intervene in this
matter. I was not aware that the question was
going to arise in the form in which it has,
through the initiative of Senator Argue.
While this may somewhat disturb the agenda
we had in mind, that is what this house and
the other place are for, to deal with matters
of national interest; and there is no doubt
that the particular question and the general
problem facing western agriculture is a
matter of national interest that should concern us here as well as the other place.
It is significant that the only participants in
the debate thus far come frorn western
Canada, all from the Province of Saskatchewan, all from the one province in western
Canada where the current wheat surplus
situation is acute.
I rise now, as Leader of the Government in
the Senate, because I am aware that some in
western Canada have expressed more or less
what is called a feeling of alienation, a feeling that the rest of Canada is not concerned
with the problems that face western Canada,
and particularly the problems that face the
grain producer in the three Prairie provinces.
I have gone out west recently and-and I
think all honourable senators, particularly

those who come from other parts of Canada,
should not hesitate to do this-to let them
know that we are concerned with their problems; to emphasize to thern that we live in an
interdependent country, and that if there is
economic dislocation in one part it is felt ii
other sections.
I told them in Regina last Monday that I
did not support the allegations of alienation; I
did not support the alleged grounds for that
feeling, if it did exist to any extent, because
we in the Governrment of Canada were concerned with the problems of western Canada.
I told them that the people of the Atlantic
provinces are sometimes concerned about the
extent of interest shown by the centre in
their affairs. I mentioned that in my own
section of southwestern Ontario it was often
suggested that the Government of Canada
was not concerned with that peninsula projecting into the Great Lakes.
How fallacious, I argued last Monday and
as I argue now, this point of view is. We are
all concerned with what goes in any part of
Canada, because this concerns all parts of
Canada. It concerns the Government of
course, because no government could survive,
and no government would be a good government, if it were not concerned with the problems of the farmer and the western region, or
for that matter all regions in Canada.
I think one of the reasons for the situation
in western Canada is that we have not
brought home to the people there what governments have done for them. I am not
speaking now only of the government in
which I presently serve; I am speaking in a
broader way. I am greatly concerned about
the preservation of unity in this country. If
each section of the country experiencing these
difficulties feels it is not appreciated by the
other parts of the country, or by the national
Government, then our integrity and our
national unity is involved, and it will suffer. I
do not believe that the separatist movement
in any part of Canada will succeedHon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Martin: -whether it be in the
Province of Quebec or in any other section of
Canada, including that region beyond Lake
Superior.
We must recognize the fact, as Senator
McDonald just mentioned, that the wheat
farmer is in a difficult cash position, even
though his sales will be higher. This year
export sales of wheat and flour should exceedi
375 million bushels, an increase of more than,

SENATE DEBATES
70 million bushels over last year. The Government has devoted, and is devoting, great
resources to the analysis of markets for grain,
particularly during the past year. We have
assisted the grain farmer in the short term by
a number of..measures, one of which was
announced in the other place on Friday last
by Mr. Lang, the minister responsible for the
operations of the Canadian Wheat Board, and
who is himself from Saskatchewan and represents the constituency of Saskatoon-Humboldt.
I can say, by the way, that Mr. Lang on
whose shoulders rests a very heavy responsibility, has brought to this problem his abilities and dedication. During the past few
months he has done all that he and others
with him, including the Minister of Agriculture, could to find solutions to the serious
problem that does face the western grain producer. He was able to reply positively in the
other place to the member for Assiniboia, the
successor of Senator Argue, with regard to
the particular form of assistance that has
provoked the motion of Senator Argue today.
I realize, and the Government realizes, that
to reduce the surplus of wheat, to reduce the
carry-over next year from some 900 million
bushels to around 400 or 450 million bushels,
is not to solve the problems of western
Canada, but it is a very important effort to
meet one aspect of this problem that stands in
the way of a solution. It is hoped that by the
reduction of the surplus of wheat the whole
wheat market and wheat marketing arrangements next year will be put in a more
balanced position.
The Government has decided, therefore, to
put the taxpayers' resources to the extent of
$100 million into a program designed to
encourage farmers to reduce wheat production and transfer wheat land into summer
fallow or perennial forage. This is not the
kind of thing that governments like to do,
and it is not the kind of thing that a country
as rich as Canada likes to do, but in the
circumstances it seems to be an essential
thing to do.
We should not underestimate many of the
other things the Government bas done in its
endeavour to meet this problem. The new
quota system that Mr. Lang envisaged is
structured in such a way that it will result in
a substantial reduction of our wheat surplus.
The new policy will also mean, as he pointed
out last Friday, that the Government will at
the beginning of each crop year indicate to
the farmer, on the basis of the most recent
marketing forecasts, the amount of grain he
[Hon. Mr. Martin.]

March 5, 1970

can expect to sell, and to guarantee hin at
the same time a firm figure per specified acre.
Mr. Lang has also indicated that he and his
advisory group are working on a proposal to
revise the grain delivery system in a manner
that will result in a reduction of costs and
higher payments to the farmer.
Apart from all this, I wonder if we are
reminding the western farmer of some other
things that are being done. The Government,
for instance, has provided a hidden subsidy to
the grain farmer of close to $72 million in the
last calendar year. The Government has to
date made interest-free cash advances to the
grain farmer in excess of $255 million within
the last calendar year, and the cost to the
Treasury will be somewhere in the neighbourhood of $14 million. We have increased
the wheat and fiour component of our external aid program to $70 million in order to
help drain off the present surplus. As another
part of our external aid program the Government proposes to allocate $12.5 million in the
fiscal year 1970-71 for special low interest
loans to developing countries to enable them
to purchase Canadian wheat. One example of
this was the recent sale to Peru, amounting to
some 7.5 million bushels. This touches a small
portion of the heavy surplus of close to one
billion bushels, but it does represent the Government's efforts and the determination to do
something about this problem. The Government is conscious of the criticism of sales
methods. I believe from what I have observed
in cabinet council and from reviews that are
given by responsible ministers that everything is being done and every modern method
of salesmanship employed to promote the sale
of wheat and consequentially reduce the
heavy surplus. More important I believe than
any short term measures, and the proposal of
last Friday is one, are proposals to provide a
guaranteed quota figure at the outset of the
crop year and to reform the transportation
system. The Government intends to introduce
in the next few weeks a revision of the
Canada Grain Act, which will allow us to
develop a portein grading system to adjust to
marketing needs of Canadian wheat customers. Finally, the Government will introduce
legislation before the end of the current session to provide for the establishment of
national marketing agencies for various commodities. Therefore it is not correct to say
that the federal Government has done and is
doing little for the western grain farmer. Al
the measures I have just highlighted, with the
possible exception of marketing legislation,
which the Government has in mind, has been

March 5, 1970

SENATE DEBATES

directed primarily to the western farmer.
There is no doubt that substantial adjustments will have to be made in the organization, pattern of production, management and
marketing methods of the agricultural industry in the next decade. The federal Government stands ready to help the western and
other farmers to make these adjustments.
This will be achieved directly and indirectly
through the creation of and their participation in, together with members of all parts of
the industry, such agencies as the Grain
Council and the Agricultural Congress.
The federal Government's program, as I
pointed out last Monday when I was in
Regina, was not exclusively confined to
agricultural assistance. Some of the developments of the new Department of Regional
Economic Expansion have illustrated that the
Government is seeking to deal with this problem which, quite naturally, has seized hold of
the imagination and concern of the western
people. We in Ottawa, in the Government and
other parts of Canada must let them know
that we are concerned with their problems.
The Government and this Senate are concerned. I know their reaction. I know how
they feel about these matters, not as well as
the senators from the west. I feel that this
debate, if it serves no other purpose than to
enable us to translate our concern for them,
will be worth while.
They are concerned about the application
of our tariff system. The farmer says that he
sells in the open market, yet he has to buy
his goods at a higher cost because of our
restrictive tariff policy. We have not been
discussing this question openly and in sufficient depth to ascertain the real facts. There
is no doubt that the tariff protects some
Canadian producers to a certain extent at the
expense of all Canadian consumers, including
the western farmer. However, we must point
out that the Government has implemented
the General Agreement on Trade and Tariffs,
which will result in a 20 per cent decrease in
the general tariff level among its signatories.
The tariff reduction in this area will benefit
the westerner in two ways. His products will
have better access to foreign markets and the
manufactured goods that he imports will be
less expensive. Even if it were true that the
tariff structure considered alone favoured the
central provinces, it is misleading in my judgment to use only the tariff in assessing the
regional economic balance of this country.
Every part of the country makes some sacrifices. Some eastern Canadians, I suggested the
other day in Calgary, pay more for their

gasoline because the oil they are buying is
Alberta oil rater than imported crude. Moreover, there is an absolute ban on the import
of American wheat, barley and oats. I am told
that if Americans were allowed to export
their wheat to Canada they could in some
cases undercut Canadian prices.
It should not be forgotten that the taxpayers of Canada, through the policies of this
and other governments, provide very substantial equalization payments. My point is simply
that any analysis of the economic position of
any region of Canada is a complex exercise,
involving much more than a cursory examination of the tariff structure.
I may have made a generous interpretation
of my rights at this moment, but I rose as a
member of the Government to let western
senators know of the Government's concern
and that of all of us, no matter where we sit,
for their problems. I do this because I am
firmly convinced that we have before us in
Canada a destiny second to very few countries in the world. Our destiny will be greater
than that of Britain and France in the next
decade. Therefore now is no time for each
section to assert that because they have serious problems they are being overlooked by
the Government, Parliament and other sections of the country. We certainly are going
to persevere in our concern for the problems
of all sections of Canada. I hope that we have
demonstrated today our concern for the problems of one of the very special sections of the
country, those great prairie lands which contribute so much to the satisfaction of the food
requirements of people all over the world.
Senators from the west may be assured that
they are not alone in their concern for the
areas from which they come.
Motion agreed to.
SALTFISH BILL
SECOND READING-DEBATE

CONTINUED

The Senate resumed from yesterday the
adjourned debate on the motion of Hon. Mr.
Petten for the second reading of Bill C-175, to
establish the Canadian Saltfish Corporation
and regulate interprovincial and export trade
in saltfish in order to improve the earnings of
primary producers of cured cod fish.
Hon. John M. Macdonald: Honourable senators, the principle of this bill is very easy to
understand. Its long title explains its purpose:
an act to establish the Canadian Saltfish Corporation and regulate interprovincial and
export trade in saltfish in order to improve

SENATE DEBATES
the earnings of primary producers of cured
cod fish.
A Crown corporation called the Canadian
Saltfish Corporation will be established by the
bill. This corporation will become the sole
buyer of cured fish and fish for curing. It will
control the movement of such fish in interprovincial and export trade. The operations of
the corporation will include the buying,
assembling and grading of fish, processing,
packaging and storing it, and finally, selling
it. By this method it is hoped to achieve a
two-fold objective: First, to improve immediately and to stabilize the earnings of the primary producer of cured fish; secondly, in a
longer period to achieve an orderly phasing
out of the traditional methods of cured fish
production and replace such methods with
modern ones.
As far as I have been able to learn, there
has been no objection to the principle of this
bill, although some apprehension has been
expressed about the effects of some of the
operations of the corporation and what could
or might be the results of such operations.
There has been general agreement on the
need for such control for the salt fish industry
if fishermen are to receive a better return for
their labour, and indeed if the industry itself
is to survive even in a semi-healthy state.
I will not go over the history of the difficulties of the industry, especially in Newfoundland where most of it is located. Yesterday, in
sponsoring the bill the honourable Senator
Petten gave a lucid, interesting and comprehensive explanation of the bill and why it
was necessary. I was surprised to learn that
the annual consumption of salted and dried
cod fish had remained unchanged for decades.
With the great growth of the fresh and frozen
fish industry one would have expected it to
be lower. However, apparently the traditional
markets have diminished as certain countries,
like Spain and Portugal, who are large users
of such fish and good customers for it, have
become more self-sufficient and their own
fishing fleets now supply most of their
requirements.
I was also somewhat surprised to learn that
there were so many people-about 10,000 in
Newfoundland alone-engaged in inshore fishing. I might here mention that anyone wishing
to obtain a good description of this type of
fishing in Newfoundland should read the evidence given by Mr. C. R. C. Molson of the
Department of Fisheries and Forestry. It is
most informative, and can be found on page
15 of the February 5 report of the Standing
[Hon. Mr. Macdonald (Cape Breton).]

March 5, 1870

Committee on Fisheries and Forestry of the
other place.
I mentioned that some apprehension had
been expressed over what might be the result
of some operations of the corporations. The
statements and briefs presented to that committee of the other place by and on behalf of
the Canadian Atlantic Salt Fish Exporters
Association show this. I would commend
to honourable senators the statement made to
that committee by Mr. F. H. Zwicker, of
Zwicker and Company Limited of Lunenburg, Nova Scotia, whose firm and family
have been engaged in the salt fish business
since 1789, and also the remarks of Mr. F. S.
Smith of Halifax, whose firm has been in this
business for over 100 years, and by others
who accompanied them before that committee.
There are just two or three comments I
should like to make on the details of the bill.
Section 21(l)(b) says that no person, unless he
has a licence from the corporation, can:
send, convey or carry from a participating province to another participating
province or to any other province, any
cured fish or the by-products of fish
curing.
That seems to be too wide. I think it would
prohibit, for example, somebody visiting
Newfoundland from taking a package of
salted cod fish home to a participating province, the Atlantic provinces or Quebec. A tourist from the United States could take fish
home with him, but somebody from Nova
Scotia could not, and there is a large volume
of travel between Nova Scotia and Newfoundland. I would suggest an amendment to
the effect that no person could "send, convey
or carry for the purpose of sale from a participating province to another".
Section 15(1) says:
The corporation shall conduct its operations on a self-sustaining financial basis
without appropriations therefor by Parliament.
Then in section 25, dealing with agreements
between the federal Government and the participating provinces, subsection 2 provides:
With the approval of the Governor in
Council, the Minister may, on behalf of
the Government of Canada, enter into an
agreement with the government of any
province to which this section applies,
providing for
(a) the sharing by the province with
the Government of Canada of initial

March 5, 1970

SENATE DEBATES

operating and establishment expenses
of the Corporation and of any losses
incurred by the Government of Canada
as a result of the operations of the
Corporation.
Those two sections seem to be contradictory.
One says that the operations must be self-sustaining and the other says that the Government of Canada can enter into agreements
with any participating provinces to cover the
losses of such operations.
Section 23(2) is to the effect that the corporation can enter into agreements with the
fishermen, upon price, and it provides in part
that fish
-shall be bought by the Corporation
from the fisherman or the producer upon
such terms and conditions and for such
price as may be agreed upon by the Corporation and the fisherman or the
producer.
I would think that a fisherman from some
outport in Newfoundland or Nova Scotia
would have no bargaining power. It says:
-such price as may be agreed upon by
the Corporation and the fisherman.
In this case the fisherman would have no
bargaining power; he would have to take
what the corporation gave him because the
corporation is to be the sole buyer of this
type of fish. If this section is to remain like
that without any appeal to anybody upon the
price, I think a move should be made to form
an association of fishermen to provide them
with some bargaining power with the
corporation.
Section 19 deals with offences and penalties. Subsection 2 of section 29 is found at the
top of page 16, and reads:
In any prosecution for an offence under
this Part, it is sufficient proof of the
offence to establish that it was committed
by an employee or agent of the accused
whether or not the employee or agent is
identified or has been prosecuted for the
offence, unless the accused establishes
that the offence was committed without
his knowledge or consent and that he
exercised all due diligence to prevent its
commission.
In my opinion, this is absolutely contrary to
our whole principle of law. Our law, as I
understand it, is that a man must be proven
guilty. This section would bring in that
system which I despise, wherein a person

must prove his innocence. I suggest that the
whole subsection 2 of section 29 be deleted.
Honourable senators, as I stated earlier, as
to the principle of the bill there can be no
objection. I understand it is wanted by all of
those who are engaged in this type of industry. As I mentioned, there is some apprehension on the part of some producers and it is
anticipated that some small plants would
have to go out of operation when this corporation is operating. It might very well be that
perhaps some fishermen too will find they are
no longer able to operate, but apparently the
saltfish industry is in such dire straits that it
is necessary to have this type of control over
it and for that reason there has been no opposition to the bill.
Hon. Malcolm Holle±t: Honourable senators,
it is not my intention to prolong the debate,
except to make two or three remarks.
I am thinking about the argument that
went on this afternoon in connection with the
Durum wheat and that sort of thing. I am
sure we can all remember the lime when
wheat growing and wheat sales were a
matter for the wheat growers. It was a question of free enterprise. Socialism has since
taken over, and today it has made the wheat
farmer something less than a happy person. I
am somewhat worried about this bill. We
were brought up in a free enterprise system
in the old days before the Liberal Government took over.
Mr. Speaker, there was much talk about
this Government today by the honourable
Leader of the Government, taking advantage
of a motion that was made by Senator Argue.
I think the remarks made by the honourable
Leader of the Government had no bearing
whatsoever on that particular motion. I was
tempted on several occasions to rise on a
point of order, but as he was the leader on
the other side of the HouseThe Hon. the Speaker: Order, please. I was
waiting for an intervention by an honourable
senator. May I repeat what I have said
before? There is a fundamental distinction
between the jurisdiction and powers of the
Speaker of the other place and the Speaker of
the Senate. It was agreed at the outset that I
would intervene only at the invitation of an
honourable senator, unless it is obvious that
we are out of order. I was prepared to deal
with the point of relevancy that is implied by
the honourable senator had he intervened. I
would hope that if on another occasion any
honourable senator thinks he should raise a

SENATE DEBATES

careful here in Canada. We have vast
resources and we ought to see to it that the
Government does not gain complete control of
these industries from the various companies
which now are trying to run them to the best
of their ability.
Honourable senators, in conclusion, I think
this is an effort made with a good heart by
the Government to help out fishermen in
Newfoundland who are today dependent almost completely on the saltfish industry.
Hon. Chesley W. Carter: Honourable senators, if I seem to be speaking rather too frequently these days, it is because circumstances have conspired against me and have
left me no alternative.
Senator Petten, in his excellent presentation yesterday, pointed out the tremendous
importance of this bill to my province, particularly to our fishermen.
It so happens that next week I shall be
away with the Special Senate Committee on
Poverty and if I do not seize this opportunity
to make my few remarks, and the observations I feel should be made, I might not get
another opportunity. Therefore, I crave your
indulgence at this time.
Senator Macdonald covered most of the
points in the act which I wished to bring to
the attention of the Senate. My main purpose
in rising is to utter a note of caution. This bill
has raised tremendous expectations in our
province, particularly among our fishermen. I
feel that there are obstacles which have not
been assessed fully and that there is a grave
danger that those expectations may be higher
than the corporation will be able to deliver
for some time.
The main object of this bill is to stabilize
prices to the salt cod fishermen, so that at the
beginning of the season they will know the
minimum price they can expect to receive for
their produce.
Incidentally, this legislation will also stabilize fresh fish prices. On the mainland of Nova
Scotia, the fisherman has two markets for his
fish-he has the ordinary fresh frozen market
where he sells it to a fish plant for freezing
and processing, or he can sell it to the unfrozen market, which usually pays a higher price.
The existence of this unfrozen fish market
keeps a floor under the price paid by the fish
plant. In Newfoundland we do not have
access to the unfrozen fish market and the
saltfish is the only competitor with the fresh
fish in order to keep the price stable. There is
not much competition between one fish plant
and another for the fisherman's fish. At times

when, there is an excess quantity, more than
the fisherman himself can handle, unless he
can salt his fish he would have to dispose of it
to the plant for whatever they may wish to
give him-and they may buy it for a cent a
pound and utilize it for fertilizer or other
purposes. Therefore, the fact that the saltfish industry exists is in itself a safeguard to
the fisherman to put a floor under the price
paid by the fresh fish industry.
To stabilize the saltfish prices, this legislation will give the corporation complete control over processing and marketing of salt
cod fish. These are very simple and logical objectives, but they are very difficult to
achieve. I would like to put on the record
some of my reasons for uttering this word of
caution today.
In the first place, this will require the cooperation of the fishermen themselves. There
will be need of a rather extensive educational
program, to impress upon the fishermen that
it is in their best interests to comply and assist
the corporation in carrying out their
objectives.
Much will depend on the person chosen as
president of this corporation. In the first
place, he must have a knowledge of the fish
industry and he must have experience in the
fish business. He must also have management
capability. Above all, he must be a person
who will command the complete confidence of
the fishermen. Without that he is not likely to
succeed. Persons with al these qualifications
are in short supply.
Honourable senators, a great deal of market
research is needed in order to market our
saltfish properly. That means research into
the size and type of packaging required by
various markets. A large body of cullers,
graders and inspectors will be needed, and
most of these will have to be recruited and
trained to ensure uniformity of quality.
One most important factor in this question
is that certain information is necessary to
ensure maximum quality, and most of that is
not readily available. I am not sure whether
research has actually been carried out, but if
so it has not been compiled and made available to the trade.
In respect of quality, our problem in the
past has been that every fisherman in the
saltfish industry has cured his own fish, the
result being that we have had as many grades
of saltfish as we have had fishermen. To
remedy this situation, the curing process must
be taken out of the hands of the fishermen,
which I presume is what the corporation

SENATE DEBATES
intends to do. That will involve having the
fish collected and taken to a central curing
station; and that again, as compared to present methods, will cost a lot of money, thus
eating into the profits of the company.
Another factor is that fish deteriorate
quickly, almost as soon as they are taken out
of water, so that the quality also depends on
when, where and how fish is caught. Hookand-line fish is generally of better quality
than fish caught in gill nets or in dragnets or
in cod traps. Deep water fish is generally
better than shoal water fish; winter fish, generally speaking, is better than summer fish,
although cod fish exist in a very narrow
range of temperatures.
There is research needed to minimize the
deterioration of all these various classes of
fish.
When fish is out of water and brought to
the curing station, the first step is to split the
fish, that is, remove the sound bone, a process
that is done either by hand or by machine,
although the latter method is not as efficient
as a good skilled fish-splitter. Usually the
machine cannot adapt itself to the various
sizes of fish so that much fish is simply
wasted and thrown away.
We then come to the salting process itself.
Here there is need of a definition, which I
have not yet seen anywhere, of what is a
light salted fish as compared to what is a
heavy salted fish. I do hope that the corporation, when it gets going, will concentrate on
the manufacture of light salted fish, because
that is a peculiarly Newfoundland-type product which used to be known all over the
world, and is in great demand even today. I
believe Senator Petten and Senator Macdonald noted that world consumption bas
stayed stable at 250,000 metrie tons and that
the world trade is about 150,000 metric tons,
but that is heavy salted fish. If we could
supply light salted fish to the markets of the
world, we could increase that by 25, 30 or
even 50 per cent.
If we are going to have uniform salting we
are going to need a uniform grade of salt, but
salt varies in quality and in salinity depending upon its source. Moreover, some salt
becomes infected with bacteria and, when it
is used at certain times of the year, the developing bacteria cause what is known as pink
fish, which is not a marketable product.
There is also a necessity for some research
to be done on the size of fish bulk. Usually
the fisherman stows his fish in a little pile
about four feet by four feet, or four feet by
[Hon. Mr. Carter.]

March 5, 1970

five feet, although there is no fixed size.
There should be a definite size fixed by regulation, prescribing a particular area-for
example, four by four or 16 square feet; and
also by regulation there should be a certain
amount of salt by weight or volume for that
given area. This would result in uniform salting. The bulk should also have a specific
height. If the pile is raised above a certain
height, the cumulative weight becomes such
that the pickle and salt and moisture are
pressed out of the bottom layers and the
quality of the fish on the bottom is therefore
much poorer than the top layers.
The answer to all these matters is the
making of regulations. There should be a
regulation to govern the size of the bulk;
there should be a regulation to fix the size of
the aluminum bins; there should be a specified measure of salt for whatever area the
bulk is; aluminum bin shelves should be
specified, and so on. All these things require
regulations.

However, the only regulations in the act
are to be found in section 15, where the Governor-in-Council makes regulations, and those
do not refer at all to the type of regulation I
am suggesting. On page 5 of the bill it says in
clause 7(j) that the corporation has the power
to "do all such other things as are necessary
or incidental to the exercise of any of its
powers or the carrying out of any of its functions under this Act". But whether that
power would include the making of the type
of regulation I have in mind or the carrying
out of the research required for the reasons I
have stated is not clear to me.
The second last stage in the process of the
saltfish industry is the drying of the fish. In
the last few years fish has been dried in
artificial dryers, which are being improved
from year to year, but it is difficult to
produce the light salted fish product in an
artificial dryer owing to the fact that it must
spend some period of time in the sun. It is
also necessary for a chemical process,
referred to by local fishermen as "working",
to take place. This is accomplished by drying
the fish to a certain point and then stockpiling it and leaving it in storage for a fixed
period of time during which the process
referred to as "working" takes place. I am not
aware what the chemistry of that process is,
but apparently it enables the salt and moisture to permeate the fish much more evenly
than would otherwise be the case.
Finally, each market for saltfish has its own
particular requirements of moisture content

March 5. 1970

SENATE DEBATES

so that every market has to have a different
type of product.
To overcome all these obstacles is going to
be a formidable job, and while we wish this
corporation every success we must bear in
mind that the amount of success achieved is
going to depend in large measure upon the
amount of co-operation achieved between the
management of the corporation and the fishermen concerned.

will be recorded in the Debates of the Senate,
because this is an area the corporation should
look into very soon after its inception.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Robichaud, debate
adjourned.

Hon. Nelson Ratenbury: Honourable senators, I am most interested in the debate on
this bill. It is not my intention to discuss the
provisions of the bill but rather to continue
Senator Carter's remarks concerning the
degree of co-operation required between the
fishermen and the corporation, if the whole
project is to be successful-and I am certainly
aware that we all hope it will be successful.
Mention was made of the loss to the saltfish
industry of the traditional markets of Portugal and Spain, the reason given being that
these two countries came up with their own
ships and began shipping off the Grand
Banks. But that is not the whole truth so far
as losing the markets is concerned. Another
important aspect is quality. There is another
traditional market for our saltfish in the
Caribbean area. It has gone on for many
years but it has deteriorated, not because the
West Indians have come up to catch the fish
off our shores, but because of a lack of quality and because of price. I feel those are
things that must be corrected. If they are to
be corrected by subsidization or quality control, as Senator Carter mentioned, or a combination of both, is a matter to be decided; but,
at the moment, we are not losing the market,
we have lost the market through those very
essential elements in the marketing of any
product.
I have had a long and, perhaps I can say,
continuing association with the Caribbean
area generally and, for the first time in my
life, when I went down there this year I could
not enjoy salt fish as only the West Indians
can prepare it-fish and ackee, frizzed fish
and various other dishes. The fish was not
edible. I went into a supermarket about the
size of this chamber and the flsh were about
"yea" thick but the colour of that desk, and
I knew from ten feet away that I was approaching the area where the salt fish was.
That is the image of Canadian salt fish in that
particular area of the country, and I do not
know what it is elsewhere.
I am glad I have had the opportunity to
participate in this debate so that my remarks

Hon. Paul Martin: Honourable senators, I
know that Senator Yuzyk has an engagement
which he must keep. It is not his fault that
this order was not reached earlier; nor is it
anyone's fault, because we are a debating
institution.
I rise at this time, not to oppose the request
for the adjournment of the debate, but to say
that we are hoping to give Royal Assent to
this bill on Thursday next. I assume there
will be no difficulty in so doing. We could
give this bill second reading on Tuesday and
refer it to committee on Wednesday. Perhaps
Senator Macdonald could help me in this
regard.
Hon. John M. Macdonald: I see no objection
to that course being followed. Senator Yuzyk
can speak on Tuesday evening, and the committee will be meeting on Wednesday.
Hon. Mr. Martin: This would be the Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Yes.
Hon. Mr. Yuzyk: I am not aware of any
others wishing to participate in the debate.
My speech will take about a half hour, and I
think I can complete it on Tuesday. Then the
bill could go to committee on Wednesday, and
I think it should be ready for Royal Assent on
Thursday.

Hon. G. Percival Burchill moved the second
reading of Bill C-133, to repeal the Deep Sea
Fisheries Act.
He said: Honourable senators, this bill is to
repeal the Deep Sea Fisheries Act, which was
passed in 1882 and was amended in 1891. This
act had its origin, following the Halifax
Award, under the Treaty of Washington in
1871.
Under the Treaty of Washington of 1871
reciprocal privileges were granted to United
States and Canadian fisherman in the territorial waters on the Atlantic coasts of
Canada and the United States. The treaty
provided for the appointment of a commission
to assess the greater value of the fishery
privileges granted by Canada over those
granted by the United States. Although, of
course, you are all familiar with this, I am
reviewing it to refresh your memory of
Canadian history.
The commission met in Halifax and
assessed an extra value to the United States
at $5,500,000, which the United States paid in
1879. Of this amount, $1 million was handed
over to Newfoundland and the balance to the
Government of Canada. Following this the
Deep Sea Fisheries Act was passed.
The act empowers the Governor in Council
to authorize the payment of an annual grant
not exceeding $160,000 "to aid in the development of the sea fisheries of Canada, and the
encouragement of the building and fitting out
of improved fishing vessels, and the improvement of the condition of the fishermen." The
act also authorized the Governor in Council
to make "such regulations as he deems necessary or expedient respecting the payment of
the said grant."
Under the authority vested in him, the
Governor in Council by regulations authorized the payment of bounty to fishermen
engaged in deep-sea fishing for at least three
months, and for catching a prescribed quantity
of fish. The amount of bounty which was payable to individual fishermen applying for it
has varied over the years, depending on the
number of applications. In the period between
1957 and 1967 it averaged about $10.
Since 1882, when no other assistance was
provided to fishermen, various forms of
assistance have been provided to them, such
as subsidies to fishing vessels, which run into
millions of dollars. In 1928 the McLean Royal
[Hon. Mr. Martin.]

Commission, investigating fisheries of the
Maritime Provinces, recommended that the
amount provided in the act be devoted to
some other productive uses; and in 1965 section 5 of the Fisheries Development Act
authorized payments for various purposes to
the fishing industry. So the expenditure of
$160,000, distributed in small bounty payments to individual fishermen who made
application, became an archaic practice and,
consequently, the Government decided to
repeal the act.
Hon. Mr. Kinley: Did the small boats get
nothing?
Hon. Mr. Burchill: The individual fisherman
did.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Hollett, debate
adjourned.
PRIVATE BILL
NATIONAL FARMERS UNION-SECOND
READING-DEBATE ADJOURNED

Hon. A. Hamilion McDonald moved the
second reading of Bill S-22, to incorporate
National Farmers Union.
He said: Honourable senators, it is with
some hesitation that I move the second reading of this bill at this time, and I have two
reasons for that hesitation. The first is that it
is late in the day, and the second is that the
attendance of senators is rather sparse. However, there is some urgency, as the promoters
of this legislation would like to appear before
the Standing Senate Committee on Banking,
Trade and Commerce next week, if it is the
wish of this House that the bill be referred to
that committee.
It is unfortunate that on many occasions we
face such a situation as we do this afternoon.
It is Thursday, and I notice that the honourable senators who are present now are those
who are always present.
Hon. Mr. Haig: We are prisoners.
Hon. Mr. McDonald: There are 24 senators
from the Province of Ontario, and as I look
around the chamber at this moment I see but
one, the Leader of the Government. There are
24 senators from the Province of Quebec, all
of whom should be here but there are none.
Honourable senators, I become a little tired,
as I am sure my colleague, the Whip on the
other side of the house, does, in attempting to
keep sufficient people in the chamber on
Thursday afternoons, not only to meet the
requirements of the quorum but to carry out

March 5, 1970

DEBATES

the business of the house in a proper fashion.
It seems to me that honourable senators from
Ontario and Quebec are showing ingratitude
when they are the greatest cuiprits in nonattendance i the chamber, especially on
Thursday. These honourable senators are but
a matter of an hour or two ini travel time from
their homes, and they have bus, rail, and air
transport facilities. If the rest of us who live
long distances away wish to return home for
the weekend, either to visit our familles or to
carry out the business of the nation, then it is
necessary for us to leave earlier on Thursdays. But, I submit to the bouse that there is
no reason why any honourable senator from
Ontario and Quebec should have to leave the
chamber prior to the adjournment on
Thursday.
A short while ago we met at 3 o'clock on
Thursday afternoons, and we found that
many of our colleagues left at 4 o'clock. The
time of meeting was moved forward to 2
o'clock, and those same senators left at 3
o'clock.
Honourable senators, this is not good
enough. Oui honourable colleagues from
Ontario and Quebec ought to stay i this
chamber until the adjournment on Thursday,
and let those of us whose homhes are at great
distances get away at least once in a while.

United Farmers of Canada, Saskatchewan
Section, Limited. That name was subsequently
changed by a special act of the Saskatchewan
Legislature, assented to on April 8, 1950, to
Saskatchewan Farmers Union.
The Farmers Union of British Columbia
was incorporated as a society under the
Societies Act of British Columbia by certificate dated July 4, 1961. An unincorporated
association known as the Ontario Farmers
Union came into existence many years ago,
and has continued to be unincorporated.
These organizations met in Winnipeg with
other interested persons from Alberta, Quebec
and the eastern provinces in July of last year,
and decided to form a national organization
to be known as the National Farmers Union.
A draft constitution was proposed and an
executive elected at that time. The executive
board of the newly formed National Farmers
Union resolved to seek a federal charter for
the better attainmnent of its objects, and they
instructed their solicitor to act accordingly.

NUCLEAR NON-PROLIFERATION TIREATY
STATEMENT BY LEADER 0F THSE
GOVERNMENT
Hon. Paul Marin: Honourable senators, I
wish to make a statement regarding the NonProliferation Treaty referred to in the other
place by the Secretary of State for External
Affairs at the end of last week.
The six-year search for an instrument to
prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons
came to a successful conclusion last week. I
believe that the Senate should take note of
this historie achievement. I refer to the
Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty which came
into force on March 5, 1970. The ceremonies
held last week i Washington, London and
Moscow, at which the United States, the
Soviet Union and a sufficient number of other
states deposited their ratifications to bring the
treaty into force, were the culmination of
many years of persistent negotiations in
which Canada played an active role.
The Non-Proliferation Treaty is the most
important arms control measure to corne into
effect to date. It represents the best solution
that could be agreed upon among the countries concerned to meet the dangers inherent
ini the spread of nuclear weapons. Its significance extends beyond this immediate objective, however, and relates also to the promotion of the peaceful uses of nuclear energy.
Canada ratified the treaty on January 8,
1969, as I advised the house on January 21,
1969. In doing so, it became the first nation
with a technological capacity to produce
nuclear weapons to ratify the treaty; thet is, it
became the first "near-nuclear" nation to renounoe its nuclear weapon option. When the
treaty was opened for signature on July 1,
1968, Canada was one of the first counitries to
sign it. We actually signed the treaty on July
23, 1968 and it was ratified January 8, '1969.
More than 90 other countries have now signed,
but some of the initial momen-tum that the
treaty had gathered was lost during the delay
of more than 18 months. Only 47 ratifications
have been deposited to date.

We trust that many more countries will
adhere to this treaty and that it wrnl become a
truly effective covenant to implement; wider
control over nuclear weapons. It is crucial to
the success of the treaty that the near-nuclear
nations shouLld adhere to it. Although five of
the eight have now signed-Canada, Sweden,
West Germany, Italy and Japan--of these,
only Canada and Sweden have ratified. India,
Pakistan and Israel have flot signed the treaty
yet.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: Has France signed it?
Hon. Mr. Martin: No. The countries I was
referring to were the near-nuclear countries.
The main provisions of the Non-Proliferation Treaty are that under Article I nuclearweapon states adhering to it are prohibited
from transferring the possession of nuclear
weapons to any non-nuclear-weapons state
and from assisting non-nuclear states to
acquire nuclear weapons or other nuclear
explosive devices. Under Article II, nonnuclear-weapons states adhering to the treaty
are prohibited fromn manufacturing or otherwise acquiring nuclear weapons or explosive
devices. lJnder the enforcement provisions of
Article III, the non-nuclear-weapon states
adhering to the treaty agree to accept international safeguards to be negotiated with the
International Atomic Energy Agency in
accordance with the agency's safeguards
system which. is designed to prevent the
diversion of nuclear energy from peaceful
uses to nuclear weapons or other nuclear
explosive devices. Essentially, these agency
safeguards would involve keeping track of
fissile material and ensuring that it is not
diverted to forbîdden uses.
Perhaps one of the more significant provisions in the treaty is Article VI, under which
the nuclear-weapon, states undertake to
pursue negotiations ini good faith on effective
measures relating to the cessation of the
nuclear arms race at an early date. This obligation on the part of the nuclear-weapons
powers was the direct resuit of the insistence
by the non-nuclear states that their renunciation of a nuclear weapons option by adhering
to the treaty should be balanced by measures
to curb what is called the vertical proliferation of nuclear weapons in the arsenals of
the super powers. Indeed, the strategic arms
limitations talks (SALT) between the United
States and the Soviet Union, which are due to
resume in Vienna on April 16, are a positive
step in the direction of the implementation of
this obligation on the part of the two major
nuclear powers.

first reading. Has that legislation been before
this bouse previously during the current
session?

Hon. Jacques Flynn: Honourable senators,
we on this side are pleased to join the Leader
of the Governrnent and ail members of this
bouse in welcoming the coming into force of
the Non-Proliferation Treaty. It is another
step in the right direction, a step on a very
long road, on which we started six years ago,
as the leader has said. Canada signed the
Treaty at the begînning of 1969; and the
Soviet Union and the United States ratified it
only in November last. Now we have the
required number of countries for the coming
into force of the Treaty.
This is a great achievement. However, we
should not be satisfied and stop at this point.
As was indicated by the Leader of the Government ini response to my interjection,
France has flot signed, and it is an important
nuclear nation. Neither bas China signed,

I think we shouid not be satisfied until al

near-nuclear nations, have adhered to the
treaty. Once we have ail these nations in
agreement on non-proliferation, we should
then set out to destroy ail the presently existing nuclear arms which, until they are
destroyed, wiil always represent a real and
potent danger to the entire world.

Hon. Mr. Martin: Yes. Honourable senators,
this bill was dealt wîth by the Senate, but
when it went to, the other place exception
was taken to the powers of the Senate to deal
with the measure which, according to the
Speaker of that house, was a money bill.
That was not the advice that had been
given to the Goverriment Leader in the
Senate, and I arn bound to say with great
respect that I think that the position taken by
the Senate was the correct one. I simply wish
to, recognize the fact that that action was
taken in the other place. I point out that our
Rule 61 reads as foilows:

Mr.

Hon.
Honourable senators, I should like to ask the
Leader o! the Goverriment a simple question
concerning Bill C-161 which has just received
[Hon. Mr. Martin.]

If these words were to stand by themselves,
perhaps it could be argued that there was an
obstacle to our dealing with the measure.
However, I believe that this rule is limited in
its application, especially with reference to
bis. In Bourinot, Fourth Edition, at page 546,
that distinguîshed authorîty has this to say:
-when a bill has finaily passed, it
cannot be introduced again in the House
where it was presented ... But there are
ways of evading this rule, when the
necessity arises. For instance, if a bill
begýun in one house be rejected in the
other, "a new bll o! the same matter
may be drawn and commenced again in
that house whereunto it was sent."
I believe it follows that leave is not required
in the Senate to, proceed with Bill C-161,
which originated ti the House of Commons.
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): If
Bourinot is right, that is a complete answer,
but I wondered if the reintroduction and
reconsideration o! the bill by the Senate is in
order. But on that basis it is.
Hon. Mr. Martin: That is right.

and, of course, he comes from the Province of
Quebec.
I can only repeat that at the hour of the
day when I rose-and it would have made no
difference whether it was I or another honourable senator who had occasion to rise in the
house-that was the situation. This is a problem we have had over a considerable period
of time, and I drew honourable senators'
attention to it in the hope that we could have
a better attendance not only late on Thursday
afternoons but on other occasions as well.

Hon. Allister Grosart: Honourable senators,

would like to ask the honourable senator why

the Company of Young Canadians Act which
are incorporated in Bill C-176, now before us.
I have read considerable material on this subject, including the proceedings of the committee of the other house which investigated the
affairs of the C.Y.C. Consequently, I do not
envy anyone who must devote many days and
much effort in order to assess a difficult situation and to advocate a reasonable solution to
the complicated problem. I should like to congratulate Senator Carter on his able introduction of this bill.
My approach to this whole question, however, will be somewhat different. For a better
understanding of the operations of this rather
unique organization, I have decided to employ
the historical method and give a brief account
of its record. I believe that this will be of
help to us in arriving at our conclusions.
The Company of Young Canadians has now
been in operation for over three and a half
years. Parliamentarians and the public have
had a good opportunity to witness the work
of a body that was designed to get the
involvement of youthful volunteers to "develop prograns for social, economic and community development in Canada or abroad
through voluntary service."
We know from the parliamentary committee that investigated the company's affairs
last October and November and tabled its
report in the other chamber December 5,
1969, that during this period the C.Y.C spent
at least $7,200,000 on 38 on-going projects
costing about $200,000 per project, which
involved not more than 400 volunteers-in
reality a small number-costing about $20,000
per volunteer. It is natural and proper that
parliamentarians and the public should now
assess the work of the company and judge
whether the taxpayers' money has been properly spent and whether this bold new scheme
is carrying out the objectives outlined in Bill
C-174, which became law in July 1966.
A look at its record shows that from the
very beginning the C.Y.C. operations and
activities were fraught with controversy. The
frequency of changes in the staff and volunteer workers and some of the activities of
certaiin volunteers were causes for alarm.
Since the organization was dedicated to facilitate social change and since its father and
patron were Prime Ministers Lester B. Pearson and Pierre Elliott Trudeau, generally
regarded as left-wing Liberals, it was not surprising that new left-wing students and youth
and other radicals were attracted to such a
body to take advantage of the money made
[Hon. Mr. Yuzyk.]

March 10, 1970

available by the Government. This- type of
youth was encouraged by the promises of a
"just society" of which the fundamental basis
was the idea of "participatory democracy".
We learn that the new leftists, at the outset,
attempted to capture a leading role in the
C.Y.C., and perhaps even to take control of
the body in order to promote a peoples'
movement of their own, but they ran into
obstacles. For three years the company was
governed by a provisional council appointed
by the Liberal Government; the council was
composed mostly of lawyers, social workers
and academics, but it did include a couple of
new leftists, who voiced their opinions vociferously, thus making an impression that the
radical youth movement had a strong voice in
the policy of this body.
The first crisis of major proportion which
shook the C.Y.C. was precipitated by an antiVietnam war demonstration before the United
States Consulate in Toronto in January 1967,
in which some members of the company
played a prominent part. This affair flared up
in public and in the House of Commons.
The Government was embarrassed and the
Executive Director, Alan Clarke, and the staff
of the company threatened to resign. When
Prime Minister Pearson announced that members of the C.Y.C. were free as other Canadian citizens to express their view on such matters, it gave the appearance that the radical
element was entrenched in the company.
Some of the new leftist volunteers subsequently took advantage of the situation and
promoted projects to confront community
administrations as well as provincial and federal government establishments. This was
evident in the project among the Indian
people of northwestern Ontario, which later
caused the resignation of ten community
development workers of the Ontario Government, who could no longer tolerate the conflict of interests, the use of subversive tactics,
and the hostility of the Indians to the provincial department. Other work of new leftist
volunteers with the poor in the cities and in
the country, with discontented youth and in
the depressed areas, where opposition was
voiced against the power structures, increasingly gave the company a reputation of being
oriented to the new left.
Although there was good work done by
many volunteers, this did not win the attention of the newspapers and the public as did
the demonstrative work of the radical-minded
volunteers of the company. Newspapers also
revealed some extravagant spending by the
company. The provisional council became so

March 10, 1970

SENATE DEBATES

concerned about the bad public image that in
February 1968 it accepted a comptroller from
the Treasury Board in an attempt to dispel
rumours of bad financial management. This
only served to undermine the confidence of
the Government in the council. In the meantime, the right wing of the council
approached the Secretary of State, the
Honourable Gerard Pelletier, the minister
responsible to Parliament for the C.Y.C., to
dismiss the leaders of the leftists, particularly
Martin Beliveau, the Associate Director, who
were accused of separatist activities in
Quebec. Apparently the minister ordered
Alan Clarke, the Executive Director, to fire
Beliveau who, however, resigned voluntarily,
as did Alan Clarke. This direct interference
by the Government in a Crown corporation,
was, I think, unconstitutional, as the only
authority vested in the minister was to report
on C.Y.C. activities to Parliament. But this
was done during the election of 1968 when
Parliament was not in session. It was obvious
that from that time the Company of Young
Canadians had lost its independence and from
now on would be a tool of the Government.
Then came the appointment of a new
Executive Director, Claude Vidal, who
endeavoured to be an efficient manager. New
leftist volunteers and their radical projects
were gradually phased out. The work of the
company was designed so as not to come in
confiict with the Government. Finally, the
company was allowed to elect a permanent
council in the fall of 1969. Ten of the 15
members were elected by or from the volunteers and five were appointed. Controversy
raged again and the work of the new council
could not get started to allow Claude Vidal
to carry on his policies.
In the meantime, Mr. Lucien Saulnier,
Chairman of the Executive Committee of the
C.Y.C. in Montreal, charged the Company of
Young Canadians with having:
-in its ranks, in Montreal, more than
one member previously convicted in
Montreal for terrorist activities;
And also:
-on the premises officially occupied by
the Company of Young Canadians and
paid for by the Canadian taxpayers...
newspapers and pamphlets showing how
to fabricate Molotov cocktails, paint
bombs, flasks and vials devised to disrupt
police work in the maintenance of public
order.

Mr. Saulnier demanded that a royal inquiry
investigate the affairs of the company.
These charges were too serious to be
ignored. Instead of a royal inquiry, the Standing Committee of the House of Commons on
Broadcasting, Films and Assistance to the
Arts, composed of a Liberal majority, was
assigned the task. After five weeks of work in
34 meetings its report was tabled December 5,
1969. The most significant part of the report
is the paragraph under the heading "Shortcomings of C.Y.C.". This I quote in full,
because Senator Carter mentioned only a few
points.
i) There is a lack of administrative procedures resulting in almost
chaotic
conditions.
ii) Financial procedures, to say the least,
are questionable and unconventional.
iii) Evidence has been adduced of an infiltration into the company, particularly in
one region of the country, by individuals
who have used the company as a base for
acts of subversion, violence and illegality,
which the administrators of the company
were apparently powerless to control. It
would also appear that public funds may
have been surreptitiously diverted to support these purposes.
iv) It is apparent that from time to time
and from place to place various volunteers, in the course of their duties, participated in overt acts of a partisan political nature, contrary to the objectives and
the best interests of the Company.
v) Your committee has evidence that the
executive director of the Company is
seriously hampered in the performance of
his duties. This situation results from the
following factors, among others:
(a) The company has no policies on the
qualifications required of volunteers nor
any definition of their exact role
and functions;
(b) There is no policy on the recruitment of volunteers;
(c) There are no policies on the training of volunteers;
(d) There are no evaluation procedures
with respect to the performance of volunteers and staff;
(e) There is no adequate procedure to
deal with the grievances of volunteers or
staff;
(f) There are no adequate policies for
the suspension and dismissal of staff and
the suspension or cancellation of volunteer contracts;

set up the proper qualifications and standards
in the choice of volunteers, and failed to
develop a sound program. The youth of today
is very democratically-minded and supports
the idea of "participatory democracy" and the
achievement of a just society. We are witnessing their struggle for a strong voice in
the administration of the universities, in
which they have achieved and are continuing
to achieve considerable success. They are
demanding the vote from the age of 18 and
they are gradually realizing this objective.
How can the youth look with favour upon the
bureaucratic type of structure that is being
imposed upon the C.Y.C.? How can the volunteers work whole-heartedly for a corporation
that is completely controlled by the Government, is paternalistic in character and in
which they have no voice?
Honourable senators, I consider that the
present legislation is too reactionary. I believe
that the withdrawal of the voice of youth in
the policy-making council will have serious
consequences for the company. For the corporation to function properly, it will be necessary to gain and maintain the confidence of
the youth, and this can best be done by
giving the volunteers some representation in
the council. I am not advocating that they
have a majority control but they are entitled
to have a voice in the decision-making organ.
When this bill goes to committee I shaH move
an amendment to this effect.
The Company of Young Canadians will
make no progress if the youth is alienated.
The Senate has one of those rare opportunities to be on the side of the moderate, positive
and constructive youth, which I believe forms
the majority of this important section of the
Canadian population.

Mr. Petten for the second reading of Bill
C-175, to establish the Canadian Saltfish Cor21498-43

poration and regulate interprovincial and
export trade in saltfish in order to improve
the earnings of primary producers of cured
cod fish.
Hon. Hédard Robichaud: Honourable senators, in an excellent presentation while introducing the second reading of Bill C-175, an
act to establish Canadian Saltfish Corporation,
Senator Petten, before this chamber on
Wednesday last, referred to the prime interest
to fishermen of his Province of Newfoundland
as well as to fishermen from other parts of
the Atlantic coast. In a few but well chosen
words, Senator Petten outlined briefly the
history of the saltfish industry, particularly as
it affects his own province. He was prepared
to admit that the contemplated reorganization
of the saltfish trade in Canada could not by
itself solve the economie and social problems
from the many thousands o! fishermen whose
families depend almost entirely on the production, processing and sale of this traditional
commodity which over the centuries had been
the basis for the founding of a large number
of communities along the shorelines of our
Atlantic provinces.
As stressed by the honourable Minister of
Fisheries and Forestry when speaking on
third reading of this bill in the other place,
the purpose of Bill C-175 is to set up a corporation the whole object of which is to
improve the lot of the inshore fishermen, particularly those living in remote communities
and those on low incomes in the Atlantic
region.
The present legislation follows a long series
between
and
discussions
meetings
of
representatives of the saltfish industry from
various Atlantic provinces and Quebec as
well as between representatives of the federal
Department of Fisheries and Forestry and
officials from the provincial governments
interested in the production of this particular
commodity.
Early in 1965 a commission of inquiry into
the Atlantic saltfish industry held a series of
public hearings in the capital cities of Newfoundland, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick and
Quebec. The terms of reference of that commission under the chairmanship of Dr. D. B.
Finn, a retired deputy minister of fisheries,
could be summarized as follows:
The commission is to inquire into the
advisability of establishing a sales agency or
board to control exports of cured fish from
the Atlantic provinces having regard to (a)
the market demand for an competition among
different forms of utilization for landings of

SENATE DEBATES
cod and other species; (b) the competition
that exists between salted cod and other saltfish products in world markets; and (c) ways
and means of improving the fish of the saltfish industry and of increasing returns to primary producers in the context of the overall
economie development of the area.
In his report, presented later in the same
year, the commissioner concluded that under
conditions existing at the time within the
saltfish industry, improvement in quality
could result in higher revenues for the fishermen. He also concluded that there was not
sufficient understanding among provinces, or
even among primary producers and within
the industry, to warrant the establishment at
that time of a Canadian Saltfish Corporation.
He clearly stated that there was, particularly
in Newfoundland, too large a number of small
establishments of too limited a capacity to
allow for the processing of a higher quality
product which could result in a substantial
increase in the export of this commodity. He
highly recommended that as much as possible
the fishermen themselves should do away
with the processing of saltfish for export. This
could be made possible by Government assistance and help in reducing the number of
outports and remote communities, and concentrating, whenever possible, the salting and
processing in larger centres where the whole
operation could be supervised and fully controlled under rigid inspection.
The commissioner also recommended that
governments should be more selective in the
type of assistance provided to primary producers so that they would not be contributing
to the keeping of inshore fishermen in a
status quo position, thus preventing them
from participating in more modern and profitable developments which in turn could
result in improving their earnings and their
ways of living.
Since this report was presented late in
1965, conditions within the saltfish industry
have shown little improvement, if any at all,
and on different occasions the Government
has been called to the rescue by being asked
to provide price support assistance to the
industry or by being asked to purchase substantial quantities of saltfish to be distributed
to needy countries under food relief
programs.
Confronted with a difficult situation, realizing that no progress could be accomplished
under existing conditions, the Government
found new pressures imposed upon it to pro[Hon. Mr. Robichaud.]

ceed with the establishment of a crown corporation which would have the power to regulate interprovincial and export trade in
saltfish in order to improve the earnings of
primary producers of cured cod fish. The participating provinces will be asked, as
described in section 25 of the bill, under the
title "Agreements respecting participation," to
enter into an agreement with the Government
of Canada to share in the initial operating
and establishment expenses of the corporation
and to share in any losses incurred by the
Government of Canada as a result of the
operation of the corporation.
Under paragraph (c) of this section, the
participating provinces will agree to undertake the payment to the owner of any plant
or equipment that may be rendered redundant by reason of any operations authorized to
be carried out by the corporation. This, to me,
is a very important clause in this bill and is
one that could become a cause of long
negotiations and differences of opinion among
the parties concerned and the corporation. I
believe that a similar Crown corporation, the
FreSh Water Fish Marketing Corporation,
which was established early last year, is
meeting similar problems.
In view of the extension of the saltfish
industry in Newfoundland as compared with
the other Atlantic provinces and the Province
of Quebec, there is no doubt that the major
problems facing the corporation will originate
from that particular province. This is only
natural and logical. One must remember here
that we are dealing with a highly perishable
product, a product which is exposed to deterioration from the moment it is taken out of
the water until it reaches the table of the
consumer. It is a product that must be under
control at all times if its quality is to be
maintained, and if it is to remain attractive to
the ultimate consumer whether on the domestic market or on foreign markets.
I fully agree with Senator Hollett that saltcured cod can constitute a wonderful and
delicious meal, even for breakfast. I have
enjoyed it myself on many occasions, particularly on my visits to his province.
Hon. Mr. Martin: Senator Hollett is going
to give us a breakfast of that food.
Hon. Mr. Robichaud: I hope he does, and I
am sure that all honourable senators will
enjoy this wonderful treat.
Hon. Mr. Holleit: I will cook it myself.

March 10, 1970

SENATE DEBATES

Hon. Mr. Robichaud: However, the honourable senator will agree with me that the
quality of salt cod used in the preparation of
this dish bas a lot to do with tempting the
palate of the real gourmet. In other words,
the quality of the flour or wheat ingredients
used in this dish offers no problem, but the
same cannot be said about the quality of the
salt cod which must be good if the meal is
going to be as wonderful as he has described
to me.
Honourable senators who have so far taken
part in this debate have been unanimous in
supporting the principle of this bill, but at the
same time they have expressed certain apprehensions regarding its implementation and
even some serious reservations on the end
results which may be achieved. In view of all
the obstacles which have to be overcome
before this crown corporation reaches its
main objective of improving and stabilizing
the earnings of the primary producers of
cured fish, one can only hope that all concerned, the fishermen, the industry and Government will approach the problem with caution and with a sense of full co-operation and
understanding.
It is no secret that while the sale of salt cod
on the Caribbean market alone has, in the
last decade, been declining at the rate of 2
per cent per annum, the sale of this commodity in the Mediterranean countries bas also
fallen sharply during the same period. As has
already been mentioned in the course of this
debate, one of the main factors affecting our
sales abroad has been the lack of a goodquality product and the failure of the industry
to supply the size and quality of salt cod
demanded by the consumer. I personally have
seen clear evidence of this situation in my
visits to such countries as the Caribbean and
Portugal, where I had talks with saltfish
importers and discussed with them ways and
means of improving this trade for the benefit
of our own Canadian fishermen.
In the spring of 1968 while visiting Portugal
I was told that in the previous season Canadian exporters had lost a sale of over 10,000
tons of dried salt cod just because they were
not prepared to comply with the requirements
of the consumers in that country. This is clear
evidence that quality control or, I should say,
the lack of quality control is one of the main
factors to be considered if this declining
industry is to be revived and operated as an
economic and profitable enterprise. Such
improvements in quality cannot and will not
be achieved as long as individual fishermen in
21498-434

remote centres and outposts continue to operate as producers as well as processors of sait
cured fish. Such improvements in quality
cannot and will not be achieved unless and
until a large number of those individuals and
even some of the corporations engaged in the
buying, curing and exporting of cod products
change their methods and adapt themselves to
modern needs and demands. The price of salt
cured cod today is too high for this commodity to be considered a low-cost food item for
the poorer class of people whether in the
West Indies, Portugal, Spain or elsewhere.
I had some hope that such a corporation as
contemplated by this bill could go a long way
in demanding the quality referred to by the
Minister of Fisheries when be appeared
before the Standing Committee on Forestry
and Fisheries on January 27 and February 3
last. In his statement before the Standing
Committee, the honourable Minister of Fisheries and Forestry also said that the object of
setting up a Saltfish Development Corporation
is to re-organize the saltfish industry and to
increase the incomes of inshore fishermen in
the Atlantic provinces.
While I support the principle of the bill and
commend the Government for taking this
important decision, I must say that I am
rather amazed by some inconsistencies which
seem to exist in the implementation of Government programs established to provide
opportunities for productive employment in
regions such as the Atlantic provinces. In
these areas the Government is committed to
establish new facilities, or at least to aid or
assist in the establishment of new facilities, to
expand or modernize existing facilities and to
make a significant contribution to economic
expansion and social adjustment. In recent
years, through financial assistance from the
Atlantic Development Board, from ARDA and
FRED programs, and, more recently, through
the Incentives Division of the Department of
Regional Economic Expansion, the Government has contributed heavily to the economic
expansion and social adjustment of the area.
However, if the Government is justified, and
rightly so, in contributing to such development incentives and at the same time providing additional employment, it seems to me
that the Government should also take the
necessary means to assure itself that new or
modernized facilities established in designated
areas must operate properly and meet the
objectives which led to such establishments.

operating in large and modern steel trawlers.
A very large segment of those engaged in
fishing operations consists of inshore fishermen operating in small- or medium-sized vessels landing their catches in ports where
facilities do not exist or even cannot be provided for the unloading of catches from large
steel trawlers.
Since the late forties the Department of
Fisheries has operated a program of grants,
contributions and subsidies concerning assistance in accordance with terms and conditions
approved by the Governor in Council for the
construction of fishing vessels, in respect of
which capital subsidies were not payable pursuant to any other federal authorization. The
expenditures for this particular item or program have varied from year to year and
attained their maximum during the fiscal
year 1967-68. It was realized at that particular
time that this program could be considered as
one of those federal-provincial cost-sharing
programs where no, or very little, control was
exercised over the amount of expenditures
involved, except by a vote in the main or
supplementary Estimates. However, in order
to bring this program under control major
changes
in
government
policy
were
announced on June 15, 1967, where an
amendment to the Fishing Vessel Assistance
Regulations, under which fishing vessels
assistance was administered, provided that all
applications for contributions in respect of
fishing vessels that were to be built according to plans and specifications approved by
the federal Minister of Fisheries must be
received before construction of such vessels
could be commenced.
Under the Fishing Vessel Regulations the
Minister of Fisheries is empowered to enter
into an agreement with provincial fishermen's
loan boards in the Atlantic provinces and, in
the case of the Province of Quebec, the Minister of Industry and Commerce, to make contributions towards the cost of building fishing
vessels of approved type or standards.
At a meeting held in Moncton, New Brunswick, in November 1967, an agreement was
reached between the federal Minister of Fisheries and the provincial ministers involved by
which the total yearly allotment of this assistance program should not exceed the figure of
approximately $11 million per year, thus
limiting the amount in which the federal
Treasury would be involved in providing
assistance for the construction of wooden fishing vessels.
[Hon. Mr. Robichaud.]

March 10, 1970

Unfortunately, it now appears that for austerity reasons, or otherwise, the Government
has decided to discontinue this program by
doing away with financial assistance for the
construction of wooden fishing vessels. As I
said earlier, to me it seems rather inconsistent
and illogical that the Government is prepared
to assist in the construction of new fish processing plants and, at the same time, adopts
measures which will result in reducing the
production of fish, thus adversely affecting
the incomes of the fishermen involved. In
other words, at a time when the federal Government, and particularly the Department of
Regional Economic Expansion, is outlining
and implementing a policy for increased production and additional opportunities for
employment in the Atlantic provinces, it is
difficult to understand how it can justify the
discontinuance of this particular subsidy
which will, as I will mention again later,
seriously affect the success of the bill which
is now before us.
While the construction of large steel vessels
which are being subsidized contributes to
increased production in certain areas, such as
larger centres, these types of vessels are not
adaptable to certain harbours where the
depth of the water is limited, and particularly
to these areas which are so common in Newfoundland, Prince Edward Island, on the
northeastern coast of New Brunswick, on the
Gaspé coast in Quebec and certain sections of
Nova Scotia, such as the Cheticamp area,
where fishing operations are of the type
which we could call an "in-between" inshore
and offshore fishery.
If we take, for example, the northeastern
coast of New Brunswick, its three main fishing ports of Shippegan, Lameque and Caraquet, with total landings now reaching over
200 million pounds of fish per season, cannot
provide the unloading facilities for large,
modern steel trawlers and must be supplied
by wooden vessels consisting mainly of small
draggers averaging from 60 to 90 feet in
length. It is also a well-known fact that from
40 to 50 per cent of the present groundfish
fleet operating from these ports is now
outdated and even unsafe and must be
replaced. Such replacements cannot take
place unless the fishermen are assured, as in
the past, of financial assistance covering
approximately one-third of the total cost. In
the last 15 years the cost of building such
vessels has increased by 60 to 75 per cent,
and during the same period the price of fish
has increased by only 20 to 25 per cent. For
example an 85- to 87-foot wooden dragger,

March 10, 1970

SENATE DEBATES

which five to six years ago could be built for
$170,000, now costs in the vicinity of $250,000,
an increase of at least 45 per cent. Similar
increased costs to fishermen also apply to
equipment, maintenance and operation expenditures. The assistance given for the construction of wooden vessels has been, in practically
every case where such subsidy applied, one of
the soundest and most effective investments
made by the federal Government in all its
assistance programs affecting agriculture,
fisheries, mining, or any of Canada's natural
resources.
Leaving aside the local employment provided by the construction of these vessels, the
Government should consider at least the large
source of employment provided in fish processing plants from the landings from such
vessels. It is difficult to understand how the
Government can justify its decision to curtail
or discontinue a program which has been contributing so effectively to the economy of an
area where practically no other industry can
be introduced. In the town of Shippegan
alone, in Gloucester County, New Brunswick,
during the 1969 season, employment was
provided in local fish processing plants for
over 1,300 employees derived from a radius of
approximately 20 to 30 miles and involving
annual salaries of close to $2 million. Similar
conditions exist at the two other ports I mentioned, Caraquet and Lameque. The Government must realize that the fishing industry in
these areas cannot subsist and operate at a
profit unless the production is increased or, at
the very minimum, maintained at its present
level. This, however, will be impossible unless
new vessels are constructed at once to replace
the older ones which are being taken out of
operation.
As a result of the Government's decision to
reduce and practically discontinue the assistance for the construction of wooden vessels, most wooden ship building yards in the
Atlantic provinces have either closed their
doors or are operating at a much reduced
capacity, being engaged mainly in repairing
the existing fleet. Furthermore, if this policy
continues a number of fish processing plants,
which provide the only employment in those
fishing communities, will be forced to do
likewise.
It is true that the continuation of a subsidy
program for the construction of fishing vessels would involve expenditures averaging
from $1.5 million to $2 million a year over
the next five years. On the basis of a 30 to 35
per cent subsidy, this could provide new construction in the amount of approximately $30

million, provide employment during the construction period for at least 600 to 800 shipyard employees, and, at the same time, supply
a source of livelihood for thousands of
employees in the fish processing plants.
Honourable senators, while I fully support
this bill, and especially the establishment of
the Canada Saltfish Corporation, I sincerely
hope that the Government will recognize a
situation which is so vital to the economy of
all sections of the Atlantic provinces.
The Government should not be satisfied
with the present measure, but should go all
the way. It should keep in mind that at least
50 per cent of the fishermen affected by the
provisions of this bill depend upon the vessel
subsidy to increase, or even maintain, their
production. Unless this subsidy is re-established at once I can assure the Government
and the Minister of Fisheries and Forestry
that the objective of setting up the Canadian
Saltfish Corporation will not fully be met, and
the incomes of inshore fishermen on the
Atlantic coast will not increase as projected.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Kinley, debate
adjourned.

DEEP SEA FISHERIES ACT
BrLL TO REPEAL-SECOND READING

The Senate resumed from Thursday, March
5, the adjourned debate on the motion of Hon.
Mr. Burchill for the second reading of Bill
C-133, to repeal the Deep Sea Fisheries Act.
Hon. Malcolm Holleit: Honourable senators
before I commence my remarks I should like

SENATE DEBATES
to offer my congratulations to Senator Robichaud on his speech in the debate on the
motion for second reading of the Saltfish Bill.
It was one of the finest speeches on fisheries I
have heard in a long time.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Holleit: I am speaking now on
another bill that concerns fisheries, but when
I am through I do not think I shall be
congratulated.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: Do not be so modest.
Hon. Mr. Holleil: This is a motion for the
second reading of a bill to repeal the Deep
Sea Fisheries Act. As honourable senators
will see, it is a very short bill, reading as
follows:
Her Majesty, by and with the advice
and consent of the Senate and House of
Commons of Canada, enacts as follows:
1. The Deep Sea Fisheries Act, chapter

61 of the Revised Statutes of Canada,
1952, is repealed.
That is the bill. We are asked to pass it and
thus erase this act from the statute books.
The only explanation is:
The Deep Sea Fisheries Act, which
would be repealed by this bill, authorizes
the payment out of the Consolidated
Revenue Fund of an annual grant not exceeding $160,000 to aid in the development
of the sea fisheries of Canada and the
building of fishing vessels. Under the
Regulations the amount of the grant is
paid out as bounties to fishermen engaged
in deep sea fishing.
It is considered that the payment of
such bounties is no longer appropriate to
present day circumstances and that the
amount of the grant provided for in the
Act could be utilized in a more productive
way.
I have read the comments that have been
made in the other place, and I have read the
report of the Commons committee on this
particular bill, and I must say that I have
never heard of a bill that got such cavalier
treatment.
As honourable senators know, this legislation has a long history. It started with the
Treaty of Washington back in 1871, by which
it was arranged between Canada, and probably Great Britain, and the United States that
deep-sea fishing would be allowed to both
Canadians and Americans on each other's
coast. It was a reciprocal agreement. The
[Hon. Mr. Hollett.]

March 10, 1970

Canadian fishermen could fish off the American coast, the American fishermen could fish
off the Canadian coast, they could go ashore
to dry their fish, and so on.
A few years later-in 1882, I think-it was
thought that the Americans had got the best
deal, so a royal commission was appointed to
inquire into what had actually happened. The
commission decided that the Americans had
indeed got the best deal, and the Americans
agreed to pay $5.5 million to offset the advantages that they had received under the Treaty
of Washington.
As was so very well explained by Senator
Burchill, $1 million was taken from that
amount of $5.5 million and passed over to
Great Britain for Newfoundland. I do not
know whether we Newfoundlanders ever got
that money because I was not around in those
days, but the net amount of $4.5 million came
to Canada for the purposes of helping the
fishermen on the east coast-the fishermen of
Quebec, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, and
Prince Edward Island.
A little later it was decided by the Government of Canada that this money should be
put into the Consolidated Revenue Fund, and
the equivalent of the interest on it would be
used year by year to pay a bounty to
individual fishermen in those four provinces.
It was called deep sea fishing in those days,
But I do not suppose it would be now. We
know it as inshore fishing. At any rate, shortly thereafter the Government of Canada
started to pay bounties of from $10 to $15 per
year to various fishermen in these four provinces. Some would laugh at that amount.
However, I remember the dirty thirties, when
I myself had to dish out dole to fishermen at
the rate of six cents per day, $1.80 per month
or $21.60 per year. The Government of
Canada had guaranteed to pay this bounty
every year. It was paid until last year, when
the Government said the payments would not
continue. Now the Government has brought
in this bill to repeal the act which made it
possible to pay the bounty.
The sum of $4,500,000 was placed in the
Consolidated Revenue Fund, and the Government agreed to pay the equivalent of the
interest on that amount each year to the various fishermen when they applied for the
bounty. Now that they have decided to discontinue the payments, what are they going
to do with the $4,500,000 and the interest
which has accumulated during these years?
Can we not trust the Consolidated Revenue
Fund as much as we trust a bank? If you put

March 10, 1970

SENATE DEBATES

$4,500,000 in the bank, even if they stop
paying interest, you expect to recover the
principal. This money was put into the Consolidated Revenue Fund for the fishermen of
these four provinces and it was guaranteed
that they would be paid so much each year.
It riles me to think that any government
can act in this way and deprive these fishermen of their rights. Remember that the
bounty has been paid ever since 1882, which
is 80-odd years. The report of the committee
indicates that in the year 1968-69 fishing
bounty payments to fishermen in Nova Scotia
amounted to $81,530. In Prince Edward Island
almost $12,000 was paid to the fishermen. We
must remember that that was in Kings,
Prince and Queens, with a total of 855 men.
There were slightly more than 2,000 men in
Nova Scotia. In New Brunswick 551 men
received $27,968. In Quebec 5,490 men
received $159,378. Other figures produced by
the committee which studied the bill, if there
was anything to study, showed that in the 12
years from 1956 to 1967 $1,916,341 was paid to
these four provinces almost $2 million.
It is all very well for the Liberals to say
"what is a million?" These bounties have
been paid to the fishermen over a period of
80-odd years and suddenly the Government
says, "You are not going to get it any more."
The payments were stopped last year. Is that
the right thing to do? Is that the way to treat
a fisherman? Is that the way you would treat
a farmer out in the west? It is a cavalier way
to treat these fishermen. They receive $8 or
$10, as the case may be, if they apply for it.
Most fishermen are honest enough not to
apply for it if they do not need it.
I do not see how the Government can
repeal this without saying, "In spite of this
we are going to do this for you." You cannot
take that money away from the fishermen of
New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Prince Edward
Island and Quebec. It was their money, paid
over by the United States government to be
paid to the fishermen. The Government of the
day decided that they would just give the
fishermen the interest every year as a bounty
to encourage them. Not all fishermen reoeived
the bounty, but a good many of them did. It
helped them many times in a great many
ways, particularly in the dirty thirties. They
got it then, not only last year or the 12 years
I mentioned. They got it whatever the weather was like.
I cannot commend the Government for
treating the fishermen in this manner. I was a
fisherman myself once. I was only 13 when I

fished on the Labrador coast, and, by jove, if I
had got $10 then for a year's fishing, or my
older brother or father had got $10 around
Christmastime as a grant, we would have been
happier. The point that worries me is, can
any government take away the rights of fishermen? It is dishonourable to do this. It is on
moral grounds that I am speaking. I do not
think the Government of Canada today
knows exactly what they are doing when they
repeal this act without saying, "It is true the
money is yours, but instead of paying you
every year we are going to do something else
for you." I know they have done a lot for the
fishermen of this age, but it has no relation to
this whatsoever. I repeat, the money belongs
to the fishermen and the Government cannot
say, "I am going to grab your money." That is
what they have done.
I hope that I will get some of my friends in
Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Quebec and
P.E.I. to stand up in their places in this house
and tell the Government that they must be
very careful as to what they are doing. If
something better than this is not done, in my
estimation the Government will have to reconsider its position. I do hope that the people
from the other provinces will back me up. I
am not talking about my own Province of
Newfoundland, and I suppose that I should
not have adjourned this debate so that I could
speak to the bill. I thank honourable senators
for their attention to my remarks.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. John J. Kinley: Honourable senators, I
wish first to thank Senator Hollett for his
remarks. Coming from the Province of Newfoundland, where they received the bounty
early but do not get it now, I would not think
the people would be as enthusiastic as the
senator is. But he said that he was a fisherman and as a true friend of fishermen I am
sure his remarks will be appreciated in the
Province of Nova Scotia at least.
I have been in politics for nearly 50 years
and before coming to the House of Commou
I remember hearing people say that this subsidy should be abolished and that the money
should be used for other purposes. I remember sitting in the house with a Mr. Neill, a
very wonderful man. He was a good member
from Comox-Alberni in British Columbia.
Whenever we got into a discussion about fisheries it did not take him long to remind me
that we in Nova Scotia received a bounty,
whereas British Columbia did not, but he was
trying to see if something could be done
about it.

SENATE DEBATES

I think my honourable friend was a little
bit uninformed about where it should have
gone. I read what was said in the other house
about this bounty, and I have never heard a
discussion that so downgraded the idea of this
bounty to the fishermen. We were told that it
was not for the good of the industry, but only
for the good of the individual fisherman, who
would use it to buy groceries and feed his
family. Even if he did, I do not think that was
all bad. Perhaps he gave it to the church-it
was not very much. Today it is not the idea
of this bounty, because it is not much-it is
the principle of the thing.
Hon. Mr. Choquette: It is enough to have
"Mutiny on the Bounty".
Hon. Mr. Kinley: It was an historie event in
the history of this country. Our fishermen
were quarrelling with the American fishermen. They said that we were invading their
rights, and we even had to pay something to
the United States because of what we did to
the fishermen on the out-of-bound claims
before this Washington committee. They
thought that the English people were in
favour of the southerners and it created a lot
of trouble. So they called the Washington
Treaty people together in order to try to
settle the Alabama claims. The fisheries question was tacked onto it so we could have
something peaceful in the fisheries and let
everybody perform as they wished. The
Alabama claims continued in Washington, but
they threw out the claims of the fishing
industry because they were too troublesome.
They came together again under the Halifax
commission which approved it. This was done
under a European negotiator, chosen in the
Old Country, and accepted by the Americans.
This gentleman was the Chairman of the
Halifax commission. Sir John A. Macdonald
and Dr. Tupper were also members of that
commission. At any rate, they were unable to
reach an agreement, and the Senate of the
United States was against it. It appeared that
the President of the United States had great
regard for the diplomacy of the British. He
liked the way the negotiators had acted
and he was anxious to have the matter settled. The committee in the Senate of the
United States then had a meeting and discussed this matter. They said that they would
go to the President and appeal to him, and if
he agreed they would authorize the payment
of this money because they wanted to have it
settled in the interests of the fishermen of
their own country.
[Hon. Mr. Kinley.]

March 10, 1970

We were told that there was nothing in the
Washington report or in the Halifax Commission report which said the fishermen should
get this money. The senators in the United
States got together and put in a protest to
show how unfair the treaty was to the United
States. I have their report here, and it shows
that they did expect the fishermen of this
country to get the money. We are told now by
speakers from the other house that there was
nothing of the kind, even in the Washington
report or the Halifax commission report. I
read from the Washington report at page 83:
In the Senate the message was referred
to the Committee on Foreign Relations. On
May 28, Hannibal Hamlin of Maine,
Chairman of the Committee, reported in
favor of the payment of the award but
strongly protested against it on the
grounds of injustice and invalidity. The
report, which disclosed in considerable
detail the opinion in the United States as
to the award, read in part as follows:
...

By the operation of the Washington

Treaty, in remitting duties (estimated at
$350,000 annually), and the Halifax Commission awarding an enormous sum
against us, the United States is called
upon to pay annually a larger sum for
the benefit of Canadian fishermen than it
ever appropriated as bounties to American fishermen.
The American report continues:
To a resolution approving the report of
the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, Senator George F. Edmunds of
Vermont, offered an amendment declaring that articles 18 and 21 of the Treaty
of Washington ought to be terminated at
the earliest date possible. The amended
resolution was passed June 1, 1878, and
on June 20, 1878 the sum of 5.5 million
dollars was placed under the direction of
the President of the United States with
which to pay the British Government the
amount awarded by the Halifax Commission if, after correspondence with the
President
the
Government,
British
deemed it his duty to do so.
Honourable senators, this bounty was not
paid by Canada, it was paid by the Americans. It was paid by the Americans because
the President was anxious to have good relations with Canada, and because the American
fishermen wanted privileges on this coast, and
our fishermen were very much opposed.

March 10, 1970

SENATE DEBATES

This annual payment of the fishermen's
bounty was one of the things that caused
peace in the situation. The British Government paid $1 million to Newfoundland in cash
and they paid to the Canadian Government
$41 million. The money, by statute, was afterwards used for the purpose of bonus for the
fishermen. This has gone on for many years.
When I first went into politics over fifty
years ago, I travelled up and down our
shores, and our fishermen were poor. Through
the years, they have advanced to a place
where I think they are prosperous. We are
happy to say that we have one of the best
counties in Nova Scotia and the best fishing
of any county in the Maritimes. We have the
largest fishing establishment in Canada, and
perhaps in North America. I think my honourable friend who has spoken is a director.
We have arrived at the point where we do
not value this fishing bounty very highly, but
we regard it as an historical thing, that was
given to our fishermen in good faith at a time
when it was needed. You must remember that
at that time it would buy two barrels of flour,
and meant much to our fishermen in those
days. It is something that our people are
proud of. Our fishermen are glad to belong to
the "big league" in Ottawa, where things are
controlled for the country and the products
from the sea are under the control of the
federal Government. We are proud to have
that connection. So dominion politics was
always a vital thing in the Province of Nova
Scotia, because of our connection with the
Members of Parliament and other people.
We were interested in it because it affected
the affairs of the people from the bottom.
I do not think that we are asking too much
to have this bounty continued. I do not think
that will happen, but I stand here in my place
representing the people who stood by me for
fifty years. I feel that I should support them
in this respect.
May I point out that many of our people
left and went to the West. There the Government gave them free land and helped them
get settled. They still have that land today.
Our fishermen got the bounty, and now they
are going to take it from them. I do not think
that should be allowed to happened.
Senator Hollett said the fishermen got this
bounty. The bounty was paid to the fishermen
and to the boat owners; the vessel owners and
their crews got more than the shore fishermen.
I have here a record of what bas been done.
They said that only a few got it; that those
who had courage enough to apply were the
31498-44

ones who got it. But the amount paid out
every year was $150,000. I think it was budgeted, and it went as high as $159,000, but each
and every year it was all paid out. It bas been
said that it went only to the fishermen and
did not help the fishing industry.
Hon. Mr. Hoet: Who said that?
Hon. Mr. Kinley: In Nova Scotia. The
individual fishermen got $25,170. The members of the fishing crews got $56,358.75. A
total of $81,530 went to Nova Scotia.
Hon. Mr. Holleti: 5,000 men.
Hon. Mr. Kinley: The vessels were cheap in
those days. When we built the Bluenose, I
think it cost $40,000. Now one would pay
about $200,000 for the same kind of ship. A
$10 bill is not worth so much, but it had
value as a Christmas present. The man's wife
got it and they all felt an intimacy with
Ottawa. This kept up our interest in the
nation. It was a good thing.
Honourable senators, it bas been said there
was a trust in connection with the bounty. I
do not think it was exactly a trust, though
I am not a lawyer and cannot exactly say. I
think it was a moral obligation that was
placed on this country. Our fishermen got that
bounty as a right and it should be continued.
The same principle applies in the case of
the Crow's Nest Pass rate, between British
Columbia and Alberta. It is a moral responsibility. They carry goods cheaper under that
rate than in other places. It was an agreement
made in good faith and it has been maintained. That is the same principle as the
bounty for the fishermen of Nova Scotia.
I remember the cheque was paid by Britain, by order of the President of the United
States. America paid this bounty, not
Canada-well before Newfoundland joined
Canada. Newfoundland got $1 million as her
part in the settlement. The idea that it was
paid only to the men and was wasted, is not
true. But of course the vessel owners got more
than the men.
Every country in the world encouraged the
building of ships and they subsidized their
shipping and their activities on the sea. Nova
Scotia is surrounded by water. Activities
upon the sea are a natural endeavour. This
payment has served to keep the men at home
at a time when otherwise they would have
gone to the West.
In the days of the wooden ships, fishing was
a perilous occupation. I have visited the

SENATE DEBATES
graveyards in my county and have seen
monuments over the graves of men who were
lost at sea. That is mostly past now, thank
God, because we have moved forward and
today we have bigger and safer ships, and
fishermen are making more money.
Honourable senators, I am going to speak
also on the bill for the saltfish board, so I will
say nothing about it tonight. We have heard a
splendid speech from Senator Robichaud, who
was Minister of Fisheries in the Government
some years ago. He knew what he was talking
about, and he has grave doubts whether the
proposed activities are the right ones.
Honourable senators, I take issue with this
bill in the interests of the people who supported me over the years in political life
and in business life. I am proud to say that
when my friend was giving out the dole in
Newfoundland the fihermen in my county
refused it because they did not want poor
money. Ours was one of the only counties in
Canada not to accept the dole in the days of
the depression.
Hon. Mr. Hollefl: But you got the bounty.
Hon. Mr. Kinley: In my opinion, the money
could be spent a little better by rewarding
people who succeed and who work harder. In
that respect, the fishermen in our county
work 70 hours a week. Theirs is not an eighthour day. They work hard and they operate
on a share basis. There is a lot of talk today
about the innovation of co-operatives. We had
co-operatives 60 years ago. As I recall, my
father used to freeze the herring in the
winter. My wife's father lost a vessel and its
whole crew when they were coming home
from that business in Newfoundland.
Newfoundlanders used to come to our place
to fish. They were splendid fishermen, but
they were not citizens of our country and no
doubt they did not get the bounty. Perhaps
that accounts for what people say to the
effect that only some got the bounty. But we
would have liked to have more Newfoundlanders.
My friend says that we have trouble reviving this fishery and that fishery, but I say our
trouble in Lunenburg is to have enough fishermen to man our fleet. We do not want more
vessels than men. You have to keep it snug or
you destroy the thing. You have to keep
everything going if you want to make a
profit, and if you do not make a profit then
you are lost. I am glad that we continue to do
well. I am glad that the big fish company in
[Hon. Mr. Kinley.]

March 10, 1970

our town has gone to Newfoundland and has
put up a $2 million plant there that is now in
action.
You know, honourable senators, I represent
a wonderful people and I know their problems. I learned the problems of the fishermen
in my youth. My father was a fisherman and
there were twelve of us around the table. It
has always been my conviction that a strong
country is made of strong men-and our fishermen are strong men. They work hard and
they have a co-operative system in which
they can share the profits. In that way we
have attained success, perhaps the best success of any place in fisheries. There are splendid places along the north shore. Ten years
ago Shelburne had more vessels than any
place in Nova Scotia.
To go briefly into the history of the people
in our region, the United Empire Loyalists
came up to Shelburne and their descendants
are still in that part of the country. The basic
people in Lunenburg are descendants of Germans who went there 200 years ago. It is
interesting to note that when Louis, Prince of
Lunenburg, became Prince George of England, he wanted a better understanding with
the French with whom there had always been
conflict, and so these people were sent out to
Halifax. When they did not get along well in
Halifax, they were taken to Lunenburg. So
the story goes now, there are two towns in
the Maritimes that have dignity and character-they are Fredericton and Lunenburg. I
suggest that you think of that when you are
considering your vacation plans. Come and
see the beauties of Nova Scotia. You will see
that even if it is said that we are poor, nevertheless we live well and it is not on charity.
Hon. John M. Macdonald: Honourable senators, I just want to say a few words in support of the stand taken tonight by Senator
Kinley and Senator Hollett. I particularly
wish to congratulate Senator Kinley upon the
fine speech he has just delivered. He has an
extensive knowledge of the fisheries of the
Province of Nova Scotia, and I am sure we
are all indebted to him not only for his
speech on the bill itself but for his review of
the history of the events which led up to the
making of this award in the first place.
It does seem to me that this is a moral
question. Certainly, no one can say that legally the Government is bound to pay this
award. The legislation was passed in 1882. It
can be amended or repealed by Parliament.
But if this has been paid to the fishermen for
86 or 87 years, then I think they have a

March 10, 1970

SENATE DEBATES

vested right in it and it should not be abruptly taken away from them. Perhaps the time
has come when some changes should be
made. If $10 or $12 per fisherman is not sufficient to make it worth while to them, and the
cost of administration is too high in proportion to what is paid out, then perhaps something different should be done. But if something different is done with this money, it
should be done for the benefit of the fishermen and it should be over and above and
apart from the ordinary work of the Department of Fisheries and Forestry. If the situation were handled that way, I would see no
objection to it.
It is said, of course, that the amount is so
small that it would make no substantial difference, but there is a question of principle
involved here. Certainly, the amount is small;
but what if the amount were large? If the
amount to be paid to each fisherman were
$1,000, would the Government be justified in
abruptly cutting it off and throwing it in with
the general revenues of the Department of
Fisheries and Forestry? I think not.
The sponsor of the bill (Hon. Mr. Burchil)
mentioned that section 5 of the Fisheries
Development Act authorizes expenditures for
various purposes. That is true, but it bears no
relation whatever to this bill, because the
moneys can be paid to any fishermen in
Canada under that section, while we claim
that this sum has been set apart for the benefit of the fisheries of the east coast-the three
Atlantic provinces and the Province of
Quebec, and it should be continued to be used
for their benefit.
Hon. Mr. Holleit: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: That was the original
intention, and that can be seen from the fact
that it was so set out in the Debates of the
Senate of 1882, which I took the trouble to
look up to see what was said about this act.
Very little was said. Only one senator, the
honourable Senator Power from Halifax,
spoke on the question. I should like to quote
part of what he said at page 768 of the
Debates of the Senate for 1882, May 18. He
said:
What we would really be entitled to if
that Fishery Award which was paid over
to the Government shortly after they
came into office had been distributed as it
should have been, the interest on that
$4,500,000 at five per cent would have
been $225,000 a year. It is now four years
since the award was made, so that the
21498-44

fishermen are at this rate really entitled
to $900,000 instead of this beggarly allowance of $150,000. My contention is that
the Government, in passing this measure,
instead of doing justice to the fishermen,
are really paying them only a very small
instalment of what is due to them.
I would add that under this act they have
been taking away from the fishermen that
very small instalment which they have been
paying them.
Once again I congratulate Senator Kinley
on this very fine address.
Hon. Mr. Kinley: May I enter as an appendix to the report of our proceedings today
some tables from the Department of Fisheries regarding fishermen?
The Hon. the Speaker: Is it agreed honourable senators?
Hon. Senators: Agreed.
(For tables see Appendix, pp. 687-8)
Hon. G. Percival Burchill: Honourable senatorsThe Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators,
I must inform the Senate that if honourable
Senator Burchill speaks now, it will have the
effect of closing the debate.
Hon. Mr. Burchill: Honourable senators, I
rise to join with Senator Macdonald in congratulating Senator Kinley and Senator Hollett on their impressive speeches this evening.
They made some excellent points and we all
enjoyed listening to them. The only comment
I have to make is to remind them of what I
said when I introduced the measure. At that
time I said that the royal commission appointed to investigate the fisheries in the
Maritime Provinces in 1928, 42 years ago,
recommended that the amount provided in
the act be devoted to some other productive
use, and my information from the department
is that that is now the intention. This money
will not be lost to the fishermen, nor will it
be taken away from them. It will be put to
some other productive use in the interests of
the fishermen.
Hon. Mr. Holleit: May I ask the honourable
senator a question? Is he aware of the fact
that in 1968 some 5,000 fishermen in Nova
Scotia received that bounty?
Hon. Mr. Burchill: Yes, I appreciate that,
but the argument of the department, as I
pointed out, is that the amount received is so

SENATE DEBATES
small nowadays that the sum can be put to
better use in other ways for the fishing
industry.
That is al I have to say.

SENATE DEBATES

chewan in recent weeks, where it has been
reported that certain of the Metis living in
Saskatchewan were in need of food, and the
Farmers Union took the initiative of milling
into a type of meal some of the surplus wheat
donated by farmers. I think this was a laudable thing they did.
The head office of the union is to be located
in the City of Winnipeg. I certainly have no
objection to Winnipeg or any other city,
but I believe that if the National Farmers
Union is to be fully effective it should have
an office in the City of Ottawa, staffed by
personnel of the Farmers Union who will be
able to visit the members of the Commons
and Senate, to place before them the desires
and wishes of the union and of the agricultural producers in Canada. There is not the close
contact today between agricultural producers
and parliamentary representatives that there
should be. Sometimes the contact is the Prime
Minister going to the Prairies; sometimes it is
representatives of the Farmers Union coming
to Ottawa. But these visits are too infrequent,
in my judgment, to achieve the desired
results.
Years ago the Farmers Union had a
representative in Ottawa, who could come
into the offices of Members of Parliament-no
high-pressure lobby-to discuss with the
members of the other place and with senators
at that time the policies and requests of the
farm organizations. That is all to the good.
We have seen some high-pressure lobbies
on Parliament Hill in the past-insurance
lobbies, drug lobbies-and there are lobbies
today against the White Paper on Tax
Reform. I feel that if the farmers are to
receive justice, they too need a lobby in
Ottawa-a lobby in the best sense of the
word-to bring their wishes to the attention
of members in the Commons and in the
Senate.
An important policy announcement was
made in the Commons on February 27 with
regard to the grain producers on the Prairies.
I have some very serious reservations about
parts of that policy. I understand the Farmers
Union representatives were asked to meet
with the Government for a short period of
time on February 11. I understand they were
asked to meet with representatives of the
Government again for a short period on
Feburary 20. Then the policy was announced
on February 27. I would think that it is in the
interests of the Government and of the
agricultural producers to have much closer
contact than is the case today, to have much
closer liaison between the farmers, the farm

organizations and the Government. That kind
of liaison would be to the advantage of the
Government and the producers.
I am positive in my own mind-and I hope.
I am proven wrong-that in this announcement I have referred to, cutting back on grain
acreages, summerfallow, quota basis, and so.
on, there are some very serious flaws. I think
they would not exist if the Farmers Union
had had an office in Ottawa with continuing
representation being made to Members of
Parliament in both houses. I would think the
policy would gain from such contact.
So, at this time I express the hope that, in
considering their organization for the future,
if the Farmers Union decide not to have its
head office in the City of Ottawa, it will at
least open an office in Ottawa so that the
wishes of its members may be known.
Honourable senators, I am delighted to support this measure. I congratulate the members
of the Farmers Union who have had the foresight to take this important step. A successful
national farmers union in the future will be
good for the agricultural producers and for
Canada.

SUSPENSION

OF RULE 95

Hon. A. Hamilton McDonald moved, with
leave of the Senate, and notwithstanding Rule
45(l)(a):
That Rule 95 be suspended with
respect to Bill S-22, intituled: "An Act to
incorporate National Farmers Union".
He said: Honourable senators, some weeks
ago when the executive of the National Farmers Union and their legal counsel approached
me with respect to the sponsorship of this bill
they asked for some intimation of when they
would be expected to appear before the conmittee of this House which would study the
bill. They made this request because at this
time an organizational campaign with respect
to the union is being conducted across Canada,
and they wished to set aside some time for
their appearance before the committee.
I assured them that if it was at all possible
this bill would be considered by the committee tomorrow. This is the reason I am asking

The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, with leave of the Senate and notwithstanding Rule 45(1) (b), it is moved by Hon.
Mr. McDonald and seconded by Hon. Mr.
Smith, that this bill be now read the third
time.
Hon. Paul Yuzyk: Honourable senators, I
moved an amendment to this bill in committee to give representation on the council to
the volunteer workers. The committee had a
lively discussion, and in the end the amendment was voted down by a slim margin.
However, may I state that the amendment
provided for a voice by the volunteer members but not for a majority of council. My
arguments were presented to the committee.
On the motion for third reading I wish to
state that I still consider this measure to be
too drastie, though I understand why the minister is anxious to go ahead with this present
structure. I do believe that the vast majority
of the volunteer workers were constructive
and positive, and that they should have had a
voice in the council, even in the minority. As
my amendment has been voted down, I hope
that this measure will be of a temporary
nature only, and that when the Company of
Young Canadians is functioning smoothly,
normally and satisfactorily, an amendment
will be made to the act to establish a more
democratic structure than is the case now.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, is it your pleasure to adopt the motion?

BUSINESS OF THE SENATE
Hon. Paul Martin: Honourable senators,
Senator Grosart complained last week about
our procedure as to the work of the Senate
and suggested that we should try to give
some intimation of the work envisaged in the
forthcoming week. I agree with his suggestion; in fact, I followed this practice for a
number of months until an exception was
[Hon. Mr. McDonald.]

March 12, 1970

taken. It was said that what I was doing was
reading the Order Paper,-which, of course,
was true.
However, in compliance with the suggestion
made by Senator Grosart, I wish to say now
that next week we will conclude the debate
on the second reading of Bill C-134 to amend
the Coastal Fisheries Protection Act, and Bill
C-183 to amend the Agricultural Products Cooperative Marketing Act, after which, if the
house agrees, these bills will be referred to
committee. There would certainly be no
objection to speeches on these measures
before they are referred to committee from
others than the sponsors. Personally, I should
like to see more debate on these bills before
thay are sent to committee.
Bill C-137, the Motor Vehicles Safety Bill,
and Bill C-138 to amend the Cape Breton
Development Corporation Act, have been
ordered for second reading on Tuesday next,
and we will definitely proceed to debate on
second reading of both those bills then. After
that we will continue the debate on the
motion that the Standing Senate Committee
on Legal and Constitutional Affairs be
instructed to examine procedures for review
by the Senate of statutory instruments. I
believe that a number of senators still wish to
speak on this motion, and I certainly encourage a wide participation in this important
debate.
The Special Committees on Poverty and
Mass Media will meet on Tuesday, and the
Standing Senate Committee on Foreign
Affairs will meet both morning and afternoon
of that day to continue its examination of
Commonwealth affairs, with particular reference to the Caribbean area. It will consider
also Bill C-12, to establish the International
Development Research Centre.
On Wednesday, the Standing Senate Committee on Banking, Trade and Commerce will
meet to hear some important witnesses on the
White Paper. Consideration will be given to
Bill C-133 to repeal the Deep Sea Fisheries
Act and other bills that will be referred to
the committee. The Standing Senate Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs will
also meet on Wednesday to consider the
Expropriation Act. The Special Senate Committee on Mass Media will meet morning
and evening on Wednesday.
In view of the heavy committee schedule
for Wednesday, it would perhaps be advisable
for the Senate not to sit, but to devote the
whole day to committee work. When I.

Hon. J. Campbell Haig: Honourable senators, I wish to bring to the attention of this
honourable house an event of national importance that happened last week in my home
city. It was the occasion of the Annual MacDonald Brier which is emblematic of the
Canadian Curling Championship. All ten
provinces were represented, including an
extra rink from northern Ontario. It was a
very successful Brier. All records were broken
for attendance at the arena. Almost five times
the number of people who attended in 1952,
more than 60,000, were present at the games

The reason I bring this matter of national
importance to the attention of this house is
that the Brier was won by a rink from Winnipeg, the rink skipped by Don Duguid of the
Granite Curling Club of that city.

The Senate resumed from Tuesday, March

Hon. Mr. Petten for the second reading of Bill
C-175, to establish the Canadian Saltfish
Corporation and regulate interprovincial and
export trade in saltfish in order to improve
the earnings of primary producers of cured
cod fish.

Hon. John J. Kinley: Honourable senators,
the bill before the house for second reading
deals with seacoast and inland fisheries. Its
principle is to improve the codfish industry so
as to make it more profitable and increase the
earnings of the primary producers. This is a
salutary measure. After debate in the
chamber, it will go to the Standing Senate
Committee on Banking, Trade and Commerce
where it will be well considered.

is not as widely used. There is an impression
abroad that because of these advances the
people of the
Maritimes
are
at a
disadvantage, especially in Newfoundland.
Before I go further, I would like to tell the
house that I was informed last Sunday that
Mrs.
Marie
S.
Penny
of
Ramea,
Newfoundland, had died of a heart attack in
a Boston hospital. She was the wife of a
former member of the Senate. For the
purpose of accuracy I will read a clipping
from the Halifax Chronicle-HeraldMarie S. Penny, president of John
Penny and Sons Ltd. of Ramea, Nfld. died
Friday in a Boston Hospital to which she
was taken a week ago after suffering a
heart attack.
Mrs. Penny was the wife of the late
Senator Gordon Penny of Ramea, on
Newfoundland's southeast coast, and
served for one year as president of the
Fisheries Council of Canada in 1967-68.
Members of the Newfoundland legislature paid tribute to Mrs. Penny following the announcement of her death.
John C. Crosbie, Liberal independent
for St. John's West, said she was a great
pioneer woman in the fishing industry in
Newfoundland and one of the few
Newfoundland women to reach a high
executive post.
Dr. G. A. Frecker, minister of
provincial affairs, said Mrs. Penny was
one of the most modern women in
Newfoundland yet retained a link with
the past.
Fisheries Minister Aidian Maloney,
praised her for her leadership and courage and said her hospitality was "legend".
I think that Mrs. Penny remains the pilot
light of what can be done for the fisheries in
Newfoundland. She succeeded in the fresh
fish industry. Now again, we had close
relations with the A. E. Hickman firm of
Newfoundland over the years, and they were
big exporters of salt codfish, but they went
out of the business years ago.
I say all this because the impression is that
the geographical position of Newfoundland is
such that the fresh fish business is not
advantageous. I think this is erroneous. Look
at the map; it is the most eastern part of
Canada stretching out in to the Atlantic.
North and south it has a good position on the
sea, so I think it is well situated for foreign
trade. As you go north around the world, the

distance is shorter; if you look at the Air
Canada map you will see that the route from
Newfoundland to Vancouver is the shortest
direct
route
across
Canada.
With
refrigeration, fresh fish can be shipped to any
port in the world.
On a cruise ship in the Mediterranean we
once had a dress parade, and I dressed as a
Canadian fisherman. I had a suit of oilskins
and a sou'wester with me and on the ship I
got a fresh codfish from ship's steward and
carried it by the gills. I won the prize. So I
think Newfoundland, being so geographically
situated, is ideal for the fisheries.
The large companies have abandoned salt
fish and the product is in the hands of the
people who live on the coastline. It is a
product that takes time and you must have
lots of room and good sunshine. It appears
that the two kinds of processing do not go
along well together. The smaller man can get
pure water from the ocean for washing his
fish.
In Nova Scotia the inshore fishermen are
largely older men; the younger men are
attracted to the deep-sea fishing, and with
good roads and truck transportation it is a
good industry. In Newfoundland we have all
the facilities needed, and the young men of
the north will make expert fishermen for the
further development of the deep-sea fisheries.
There is a fisheries in Riverport, Nova
Scotia, near Lunenburg, that had a large salt
fish trade with Cuba, but that has largely if
not completely disappeared. I understand that
they too have gone out of the salt fish
business, so the road is open for the smaller
man.
Let us look at the economic situation for a
moment. As I said in my reference to Mrs.
Penny, the salt fish business is not the main
source of income in Newfoundland. The fresh
and frozen fish industry is twice as valuable
as the saltfish industry. Other fisheries such
as salmon, lobster, mackerel, squid, caplin,
herring, the seal fishery, fish meal and whale
collectively are of much more value than salt
codfish. However, the hook-and-line codfish
fisherman needs much less equipment than
some others, and so this has become the
fishery of the poor man on the distant
coastline. He is the problem today because of
his situation and lack of opportunities. I
would add that in Newfoundland these people
had very poor transportation facilities, and
were very much isolated. However, today
they have better roads and with truck
transportation and automobiles, they can

SENATE DEBATES
serve the deep-sea fisheries because they can
more easily reach the markets in St. John's
and other places along the coast. I think that
in the future the Newfoundland fresh fish
industry will receive a tremendous impetus.
National Sea Products in Lunenburg, the
largest fish producing company in eastern
Canada, has abandoned for some years now
the salt fish industry. But I hear they have
been attracted to and built a plant in
Newfoundland. I am sure they were attracted
there because of the nearness of the fishing
grounds to the factory and the fact that
Newfoundlanders make such great fishermen.
I expect they will, as they did in Nova Scotia
and New Brunswick, make a great success of
this venture in Newfoundland. Needless to
say, having had close associations with these
people in the past, I hope they will be
successful.
Now, with regard to the export of fish,
Nova Scotia exports more saltfish than does
Newfoundland, and we are told that the 35
per cent of saltfish from Newfoundland is
sold to Nova Scotia fish dealers who, it
appears, have paid a better price and use
their own vessels for transportation. I was
always taught that we had free trade in
Canada, one province with another under the
British North America Act, but it appears
that this is not so under this bill.
The
honourable
Senator
Petten
in
explaining the bill-and be gave a splendid
explanation-struck a note when he said:
In 1918, Sir William Coaker, the then
Minister
of
Marine
Fisheries
in
Newfoundland, attempted to bring in
regulations to control grading, packaging,
exporting, et cetera. However, be did not
have the backing of all exporters, and the
plan fell through. With the coming of
government by commission in Newfoundland, the commission formed the Fisheries Board and introduced many of
Coaker's regulations. Because of their
absolute control they could do what he
could not.
My objection to this bill is that it creates
a monopoly. Parts of section 21 are objectionable, as are parts of sections 22 and
23, which do not protect the liberty of the
subject in regard to a fisherman's activities as
a producer and curer and the sale of his
product in competition.
Under section 15 there is provision for a
reduced municipal tax. I think that is
salutary. The Government will pay the
[Hon. Mr. Kinley.]

March 12, 1970

municipality what it would otherwise receive
in taxes, and that will help the municipalities.
However, it appears to me that if what is
spent on overhead is not a subsidy, then it is
a grant, and it amounts to the same thing.
There are now sixty firms in the saltfish
industry, some small and some large, in the
rural districts of Nova Scotia. They largely
supply the American market. We have good
inspection under the federal Government and
we believe in quality, which may be a feature
of the participation by the provincial
authorities. I think good fish should have a
free market.
Prices are good. I think Senator Robichaud
mentioned that in his speech. Senator Hollett
said our fishermen got anywhere from $30 to
$35 a quintal. I was not too sure of that, but I
conferred with the people on the shore. He is
right; that is the price today, and it is a
splendid price. This is for green codfish for
the American market. We are so near the
market that we can get our fish to it
overnight; there is no difficulty in that regard.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: How many pounds are
there in a quintal?
Hon. Mr. Kinley: 112 pounds.
As I say, prices are good, and we do not
believe that this commission will be able to
do very much about them. It is a very much
higher price than for fresh fish today. Here in
Ottawa you pay 90 cents to $1 a pound for it.
Of course, it contains no bones such as you
have in meat; it is all good to eat. What you
eat is largely a matter of training and what
you get used to. We ate saltfish every week
when I was a boy. Now we eat it for a
change; the same applies to corned beef. It is
splendid food, and we want good quality. It is
selected by buyers who come here from
Europe, and they know their job. With a
growing population, the market in it could be
revived and we could have much larger sales.
We are not being allowed to compete in
Canada. We in Lunenburg compete with
Newfoundland. You must remember that St.
Pierre and Miquelon are just over the
horizon, and they are in the fishing business.
Norway has a lower standard of living, and
they are in the fishing business; and do not
forget that Iceland is in the market and they
are keen competitors. So, as I say, I do not
think we could do much about the price, but
with the development of the northern part of
the Province of Newfoundland, with easier
access by road for trucks and automobiles, by

Newfoundlanders have reached and are
continuing to reach high places in Canada,
and with improvements in education many
young men want to go abroad, to places
where they will have a better chance of
advancement. We cannot help that, but we
can make conditions as attractive as possible
for them in their own home.
In Lunenburg we had many Newfoundlanders. In fact, we had 800 just before
the vote on union with Canada. My wife
and I paid them a visit at that time, and
I did not know what to say. I could not say
much because the feeling was running pretty
high in St. John's. I said that if I lived on
Water Street in Newfoundland I would vote
against joining Canada. I think that pleased
them, but there was a small majority in
favour of union. As I said, 800 were working
in Lunenburg, their families living in
Newfoundland, and I think their absence
frorn Newfoundland was almost enough to
carry it. I give credit to the fishermen who
came to Lunenburg from Newfoundland for
carrying the banner of Newfoundland at the
time of the Confederation plebiscite. Not so
many of them come to Lunenburg now. Times
are
better
in
Newfoundland
since
Confederation; wages are better and they get
more on the waterfront.
We are short of men in the fishing business
in our part of the country and Newfoundland
produces splendid men. We fell down during
the war when we did not build bouses for
them and give them comfortable living
conditions. They came to us in the summer
and went home in the winter. So, in the end,
not many of thern came to Lunenburg. I
think they have a great opportunity in
Newfoundland and if it is grasped and they
are properly looked after, they will do well in
the fresh fish business.
We used to have the Grenfell Mission boat
going to Labrador every summer. It put into
Lunenburg, and the crew and captain came
frorn Lunenburg. They were financed by
Ottawa-not by the Government, but by
prominent businessmen here. She has been
taken out of commission now because roads
have been put into that part of the country.
They can now run a ferry across te Labrador,

which illustrates the advances that have been
made in communications, and the mission can
be supplied in another way.
Hon. Mr. Holleit: I suggest that the
honourable senator look up his history of
Labrador and Newfoundland, because after
you get across the strait there is no road.
Hon. Mr. Kinley: I thought there was now a
road right up to St. Anthony.
Hon. Mr. Holleti: There is a rough road.

the

Hon. Mr. Kinley: It is a fairly narrow
strait, about 12 miles across. However, we
will not quarrel about that.
We were told by the gentleman over here
that he was not interested in politics. I am
interested in politics, but I do not think that
politics is being played with regard to this
bill, because in the lower house all the
members from Newfoundland voted with the
minister, and they are not Liberals. In this
chamber we are giving it second thought, and
some of our friends are trying to give it
second thought. I hope that all of us will do
so. In this way I hope that we will succeed in
obtaining a good piece of legislation. Perhaps
some of the amendments Senator Macdonald
wants to include will be made, and we will
keep our people free in Nova Scotia so that
they can operate competitively, without having to receive the blessing of a board before
they can sell any fish in another province. I
do not like that aspect of the bill.
However, the fishermen of Newfoundland
are doing much better, and I do think that the
activity in the fresh fish business will
increase. It has received the green light from
Mrs. Penny, and from the big fish companies
of Nova Scotia that are going down to do
business. From those facts, and the fact that
the big fish companies have retired from the
saltfish business in Newfoundland, I think the
road is clear and everybody will have a
chance. I say that we should buy fish in
Newfoundland if we can get it at a better
price.
Hon. Mr. Holleti: Yes, at four cents a pound.

pay the rate prescribed by the corporation to
the fishermen.
At this point, honourable senators, I may
say I have some concern in respect of the
working conditions and rates of pay
prevailing in such fish plants, as they
apply to persons engaged in the actual
handling of fish. Their lot has nat been a
happy one in the past, and I wish to call the
attention of the corporation to this vital
matter. I suggest to the corporation that in its
dealings with the fish plants, where underpaid
employees are engaged in the curing of saltfish, it should have the necessary authority
and desire to impose rules that will ensure
suitable working conditions and reasonable
wage rates, and that when the threadbare
claim of inability to pay is resurrected there
will be an audit of accounts conducted to
determine whether that claim is authentic.
In conclusion I wish to extend a cordial
invitation to the corporation to consider
Harbour Grace as a suitable site for the
establishment of its headquarters. The town of
Harbour Grace is a winter-free port, and if
suitable facilities are not already available
then suitable locations are available on which
such facilities can be erected.

other province, any cured fish or the
by-products of fish curing.
I question the constitutional validity of an
agreement between the federal Government
and a group of provinces even as to the
restriction of trade among those provinces. It
appears to me, from my limited knowledge of
constitutional law, that legislation which attempts to restrict trade as between any participating province-that is, in agreement with
the federal Government-and some other
province that does not participate, could well
be outside the ambit of the jurisdiction of
the federal Government.
I would hope that this matter will be
looked at very closely by the committee that
considers this bill.

Hon. Daniel A. Lang: Honourable senators,
I know it is rather unlikely that I should rise
to say anything on a matter that is as foreign
to my knowledge as is this piece of
legislation. I must admit that I have not
followed the debate very closely, but some of
the remarks of Senator Kinley caused me to
examine the bill in terms of its constitutional
validity. I hope that the committee to which
this bill is referred will look at this matter,
because it appears to me that this bill is on
the fringe of violating the Constitution. It
provides for the entering into of an
agreement between a group of participating
provinces and the federal Government in
respect of the restriction of trade as between
the participating provinces and the rest of
Canada.
I would draw the attention of honourable
senators particularly to clause 21 of the bill

Hon.
Andrew
Thompson:
Honourable
senators, the Leader of the Government, with
his usual deep scholarship, provided a
summary, analysis and recommendation when

SENATE DEBATES
statutory
report
on
presenting
the
instruments tabled in the other place. The
Leader of the Opposition has added pertinent
and penetrating comments in support of the
motion.
Senator Phillips (Rigaud), with his usual
erudition and clarity, in analysing the report
reached back to the historical background of
the emergence of concern with respect to
delegated authority. Indeed, be took it back to
1929, the time of the publication of The New
Despotism by the Lord Chief Justice of
England, the Right Honourable Lord Hewart
of Bury. That book was a clarion call to alert
the British Parliament concerning the danger
of the erosion of their responsibilities, and to
alert the people of every parliamentary
government that their Parliament could
become a façade and they could be living
under administrative government in an
administrative state in which the rights of the
people would be decided by a bureaucracy.
I do not rise to speak my few words with
any of the impressive and substantial
qualifications of the previous speakers. I am
not a lawyer and I do not have the
distinguished experience of those who spoke
before me, the experience they have had, not
only as lawyers, but as observers of
government. My initiative to speak was
stirred first by the rousing challenge of
Senator O'Leary. Perhaps with my accent you
can understand why the music and sweep of
his oratory stirred a particular chord in my
veins.
Hon. Mr. Martin: Just think what it is
doing in Washington today.
Hon. Mr. Thompson: I am sure it is stirring
the American people with the same effect.
Hon. Mr. Martin: I am sure it bas shaken
the White House.
Hon. Mr. Thompson: I would not go quite
so far as that. He cried out at the erosion of
the responsibility of Parliament to a faceless
bureaucracy. I, having had some experience
in another legislative and having studied
some of the examples where we handed over
our responsibilities to a number of administrative bodies, did respond to this. Let me
first of all refer to the definition of delegated
legislation that was presented by my leader:

the Treasury Board, or other boards or
commissions set up by Parliament.
The problem of keeping Parliament
and the public informed with respect to
the large volume of this subordinate
legislation, and providing opportunities
for Members of Parliament to review it,
such legislation, bas long been discussed
by governments in this and other
countries.
To the layman this subject matter sounds
as though it belongs in the dusty, dry shelves
of the academics and perhaps of some of the
legal fraternity. Why is it of such vital
significance? Why did Lord Hewart's book
The New Despotism arouse such concern?
Senator Phillips (Rigaud) pointed out the
theme of the book:
Its theme was that the administrative
branch of government had embarked
upon a sinister plan to take over the
country, subjugate Parliament and the
courts to its bureaucratic will, violate the
rule of law and set up a modern
counterpart of the tyranny of the Stuart
Kings.
We are discussing only one aspect of
administrative law but, indeed, there are
many other areas that could be under discussion. All of us who have participated in
public life at some time or other have felt the
fury of impotence as we have tried to represent a citizen of Canada and have been faced
with a bureaucrat thumbing through a book
of regulations or definitions which never
stood before the scrutiny of Parliament. We
have seen particularly how some of these
regulations or definitions can affect the very
lives of Canadian citizens, and we cannot say
who was responsible for putting them on the
pages of law.
I recall my excitement at the first time I sat
in the public gallery of the House of Commons. I remember how I tingled with excitement on listening to a member, a back bencher in the other place, standing up, staring at
cabinet ministers and with great oratory
denouncing what be alleged was an arrogant
government, indifferent to the rights of the
citizen. He was a man who is probably known
better to some of the other side, coming from
a northern Saskatchewan constituency. In my
opinion, he was serving his country well and
bringing before not only Parliament but all
the people of Canada, the cause of a citizen. I remember thrilling to the fact that in
our Parliament when a member stands up

March 12, 1970

Marc 12.1970SENATE
DEBATES

and serutinizes legisiation he defends the
cause of the individual citizen. That cause
can be read and examined in newspapers and
by modern media across the land. That is
why we should be concerned on realizing that
there is legisiation and regulations which do
flot corne before the glare of Parliament.
Senator Phillips (Rigaud) pointed out that
the House of Con-iions committee report had
shown the extent of such delegated legisiation. The committee had examined 601 acts of
Parliament and found that 420 of these had
provided for delegated legîsiation. During the
period from January 1, 1956 to December 31,
1968, 6,892 regulations coverîng 19,972 pages,
amounting to an average of 530 regulations a
year, were published in the Canada Gazette.
There are examples, of course, of these regulations. One example is the food and drug
regulations-not the bill-which consîsts of a
book of more than one inch in thickness. The
Meat Inspection Act is seven pages, while the
regulations under its authority consist of 64
pages.
Professor Kerseil, who wrote Parliamentary
Supervision of Delegated Legislation, said
that the concern is with these regulations. If
they are not before the scrutiny of Parliament, but are written after by a faceless
bureaucracy, the concern is that the expert
public servants may become the masters of
the people they are employed to serve.
I am sure that ail of us can think of exampies of discretionary powers being left i
legisiation and a bill has gone through which
permit',ed the regulations to be fleshed out
later. Indeed, there would
probably be
openings that a team of horses could be
driven through that we have permitted to
be lef t open for the civil service to fill in. Dr.
Kersell gave examples when he appeared as a
witness. These examples were bills which had
passed with broad delegating clauses. He
referred to a study of such bills by two other
professors. He pointed out a bill-No. 131which had been passed in 1965 which listed a
variety of estimates, specifying in detail how
much was to be spent under these estimates,
as weil as specifying the ternis and conditions, et cetera. At the conclusion of the bull it
had provided that $750 million were for
public works and general purposes. The only
restriction under general purposes was that
the Governor in Coundil should provide the
rate of interest.
When I think of my own experience ini
another legisiature, when I was a member of
the Opposition, I recail a study done by a

Professor Schindeler i which he described
an example of an amendment to a Department of Agriculture Act which went through
two readings i that legisiature. It authorized
the Minister of Agriculture to guarantee loans
for anyone he chose, for whatever purpose
and for whatever amount he desired. Fortunately, it was changed, but I am ashamed to
say that it was not by the Opposition of
which I was a part that this change occurred.
It happened to be by a civil servant within
the departmnent who said a bill such as that,
giving a cabinet minister such wide discretionary powers, should not be passed. Fortunately, it was amended before third reading.
It then stated that the maximum loan was for
$2,500, only to be used for the purpose of
transporting and purchasing water. There are
many other such examples.
It is true that ail of us deplore these broad
delegated powers, but we should also consider
the reasons that have been given to justify
such delegation. The reasons, of course, are
that Parliament is too busy, and that legisiation in a modemn society is of a highly technical nature. In the initiating stages of legishation, perhaps ini an area which is new and
untried, there is need for flexibility in order to
avoid the necessity of returning to Parliament
for an amendment to the current act. There is
often a need for rapid decision in cases of
emergency. Senator Pbillips mentioned these
points, but he also queried their validity. Ferhaps we accept too quickly and too often the
idea of permitting broad legisiation and broad
clauses.
Dr. Kersell, when he appeared as a witness,
stated that there should be much more precision in the drafting of enabling legishation. He
said that you do not have to gîve blanket
authority, and referred to Great Britain, the
United States Congress, Australia and New
Zealand. He said that there is much more
precision in those countries. He described
Great Britain, in particular during the war
years when there was a coalition govemnment,
that there was a group of active Conservative
backbenchers who refused to let these broad
clauses go through until it had been clearly
stated that such clauses would be rescinded
after the war emergency. After the war that
commitment was upheld. They do not easily
give up their legislative rights and hand them
over to the administration.
Most critics of regulation-making do flot
seek to deny its necessity in some form. Their
complaints have been aimed against the
volume and the character of dehegated legisia-

SENATE DEBATES

tion rather than against the practice itself.
The more fundamental of the criticisms can
be summarized as follows:
1. The parliamentary tendency to enact
statutes in skeleton form, leaving the details
to be filled out by regulations, some of which
often are the very matters that most affect
the citizen.
2. The uncertainty in enabling statutes as to
the extent of the area which the regulations
are intended to cover.
3. The sweeping or the subjective terms
which are used in enabling acts which
exclude the judicial control of the regulations
made under their authority.
4. The lack of public debate; the inadequate
consultation of all interested parties before
the making of the regulations.
5. The lack of precision in the form and
content of the regulations.
6. The inadequate publicity given to the
regulations after they have been made.
7. The inadequate parliamentary control
over regulations.
In summary, what has been said is that
there is a danger that civil servants may be
transformed into our masters if we hand over
the drafting of the law to them and do not
realize that the drawing up of the law is our
own responsibility. The criticisms that I have
listed are the criticisms of delegated legislation which were pointed out in the Report of
the Committee on Ministers Powers in Britain, in 1932. I responded to Senator O'Leary's
challenge because I think some of those criticisms made in 1932 in Britain are still valid
in Canada in 1970.

The committee report which was presented
reflected a distinguished background in public
service of the committee members, and particularly the scholarship of Dr. Mark MacGuigan, the chairman, the member for WindsorWalkerville. Our Leader, in his presentation
on the report, reviewed what had been done
at the federal level to find workable solutions
to this problem of delegated legislation prior
to the formation of the committee. Then he
summarized the 22 recommendations which
the committee in the other place had made.
I would like to repeat the four broad
proposals, rather than elaborate on each of
the 22 recommendations.
The committee proposed (1) that the Government consult fully with the public and
with parliamentary standing committees,
before making regulations. (2) It proposed an
extension of the ambit of the present internal
[Hon. Mr. Thompson.]

March 12, 1970

scrutiny of regulations by the Privy Coundil
office and the Department of Justice during
the making of regulations. (3) It proposed full
publication of regulations after they had been
made, with limited exceptions. Our Leader
pointed out that the exceptions should be discussed when the report is taken to committee.
(4) It proposed the establishment of a new
parliamentary standing committee on regulations to provide for public scrutiny of those
regulations.
Honourable senators, other speakers before
me referred to the definition of "regulations".
They referred to the guiding principles in the
drafting of regulations. I would like to
endorse what Senator Martin has said, in that
we have been fortunate at the federal level to
have had people with the skill and the dedication in the drafting of legislation. I am sure
those of us who have had anything to do with
drafting legislation are aware just how qualified must be those who do it.
The question which I think bas caused
interest in this house is the recommendation
regarding the scrutiny committee to examine
the regulations. We have the advantage in
Canada to look at the experience in other
countries. We can look at the experience in
Great Britain, Australia, India, New Zealand;
and we can look at the experience, indeed, in
some of our provinces-Manitoba, Saskatchewan-and we can look at Chief Justice
McRuer's report and indeed at Bill 125 which
is now before the Ontario Legislature.
Honourable senators, what is the breed of
animal, what really is the kind of setup that
other jurisdictions have with respect to a
scrutiny committee? Dr. MacGuigan pointed
out that all of the scrutiny committees have
the following features in common-they are
small committees, they rely heavily upon the
preliminary examination and reports of the
legal counsel; indeed, comment was made
that the legal counsel, the staff of the committee, is the committee. That comment referred
to the scrutiny committee in the British
house. Also, Dr. Kersell pointed out that
Senator Wood, the chairman of the Australian
committee, made the same remark.
The other point is that the scrutiny committee is more concerned with form, language, and the operation of regulation than
with substance. It is an objective and nonpartisan committee, it reports the result of its
examination to the legislature, and it follows
certain criteria in examining legislation.
The committee in the other place recommended that there should be a new commit-

March 12, 1970

DEBATES
Marc 12,1970SENATE

tee on regulations, w'hich should be hereafter
called tbe scrutiny comimittee. They recommended it should be establisbed with the following particulars. The first point they made
was that it shouid be established as a standing committee of the House of Commons.
Dr. Kerseil is considered Canada's leading
authority on the subject of delegated authority, and certainiy the comxnittee, as was pointed out by Senator Pbillips, relied heavily
on bis recommendations, as it did on tbose of
other seholars. But as Senator Phillips said, it
seemed not to rely on the one recommendation he had made in his book. At page 27 of
bis book ParliamentarySupervision of Delegated Legislation, Dr. Kerseil said:
It would appear from a comparison of the
Australian Senate Committee and the
British House of Commons Committee
that, useful as the House Comniittee, is
an Upper Chamber Committee enjoys a
number of significant advantages.
Senator Martin bas elaborated on a number
of the points wbich Dr. Kerseil made concerning tbe advantages of an upper bouse
conunittee, such as the fact tbat it is not
squeezed by dlock and calendar-altbougb I
sometimes wonder if that is stili valid in tbis
chamber. He referred to the fact tbat the
membersbip in an upper bouse comnuttee, as
in Britain, Australia and Canada, has a general proportion of able experienced men with
long administrative and executive experience.
That is certainly valid in this chamber.
Dr. Kerseil also pointed out the valuable
element of continuity wbich the upper bouse
has. Wben be appeared before the House of
Commons commnîttee he did not refute this
stand that he bad made in bis book, but
rather supported it. He spoke about the
Senate being a logical place for tbis scrutiny.
That is wby Senator Phillips (Rigaud) found
it bard to follow the logic of the House of
Commons committee wben it suggested tbat
the Commons was tbe place where te standing committee sbould be established. I tbink
Senator Pbillips referred to the comimittee's
recommendation as a non-se quitur based
upon a false premise. Well, I amn sympathetic
to some extent with what mnust be tbe motivation on the part of the members of that
cormlittee. After ail, ini the first paragraph of
the preface of the report it is stated:
This report is based on the assumption
that public knowledge of goverrmental
activities is the basis of ail control of
delegated legisiation. For parliamentary
demnocracy is a systemi of government
21498-45

wbicb. requires that the executive be
responsible to the legisiature, and that
both be accountable to the people, and
tbat tbere can be neither responsibility
nor accountabiity where tbere is no
knowledge of wbat bas been done.
The words tbat strike me are "accountable
to the people". On tbat basis I sbould like to
suggest that tbere should be a joint committee
of both bouses. Indeed, some of the key witnesses suggested tbat a joint committee of the
House of Commons and Senate would give us
tbe best of two worlds.
Certainly, the Senate bas a proud tradition
in tbe examination of bills. Dr. Kunz, in bis
book The Modern Senate of Canada 1925-1963
-A Re-appraisal, which. I read just prior
to coming to tbis chamber, clearly stated tbat
this is a role wbich the Senate bas fiiled
effectively and ably over tbe years. Senator
Martin referred to that role. Wben we look at
the reports of the meetings of tbe House of
Comnnons, we will see that tbe members of
the committee were undecided about baving a
joint comniittee. Some of tbem felt that tbis
was a logical approach. The expert witnesses
accepted the idea of a joint committee. I tbink
if we accept that proposai we will be following tbe basic underlying theme of tbe report,
wbicb, is that if Parliament wants to retain its
supremacy over the executive it bas to exercise its control over legisiation.
Senator Pbiilips (Rigaud) and Senator
Martin pointed out that this was only one
area of delegated authority. Senator Martin
referred to boards and commissions and
Crown corporations. Senator O'Leary referred
to the danger of Crown corporations not
being given full exammnation by Parliament. 1
think we should recognize the number of
Crown corporations there are at the federal
level. In 1969 there were no fewer tban 47
federal Crown corporations directed by more
than 200 non-elected officiais. Recently I bave
beard discussions about turning the Post
Office and the Department of Public Works
into Crown corporations. There is also discussion about the Medical Research Coundil
becoming a Crown corporation. Perhaps in a
modern society this is the way to conduct
goverrnental administration. Certairily, the
trend is te have Crown corporations. In 1950
there were 26; in 1960 there were 35; in 1969
tbere were 47.
It surprises me that there bas been very
little examination of the accountability of
Crown corporations in Canada. Very littie
study bas been done. I was interested in look-

SENATE DEBATES

March 12, 1970

ing at some of the discussion in Great Britain
in respect of the accountability of Crown
corporations.
In this connection I should like to refer
honourable senators to a series of lectures,
the W. Clifford Clark Memorial Lectures,
1964, delivered by the Right Honourable Lord
Bridges, a prominent civil servant in England,
who served as Secretary to the United Kingdom War Cabinet throughout the second
world war, and who, from 1945 until his
retirement in 1956, was Permanent Secretary
to the Treasury and was official head of the
Civil Service. It is not my intention to elaborate at length on these lectures.

Lord Bridges then goes on to discuss the
relationship between a minister and the
boards that are responsible to a minister. In
that connection he makes reference to an
account given by Herbert Morrison in his
book Government and Parliament, and in a
more or less paraphrase of what Morrision
says, Lord Bridges has this to say:
You see the idea: free, frank and
friendly discussion about everything
about which either party wants to discuss, avoiding detail and keeping to
issues of policy; but each party being
fully conscious of the responsibilities of
the other party.

Hon. Mr. Martin: I hope you are not looking at the clock, because you are making an
outstanding speech.

He goes on to say:
This all sounds very sensible, jolly and
matey. But it has been described as "old
boy basis" and bas occasionally been
complained of on this account.

Hon. Mr. Thompson: I should like to refer
to one lecture, "The Relationship Between
Government and Government-Controlled Corporations", written in an urbane, witty style
to be expected from a man of the calibre of
Lord Bridges. In this talk Lord Bridges cites a
number of British corporations which lie
"suspects" probably add up to about 200. He
picks out only certain categories of these,
such as The Bank of England, Trinity House,
The Race Course Betting Control Board, and
The National Stud. If I may, I will quote
briefiy from his remarks. He says:
So much for examples. You may ask
whether it is an advantage to have this
large assortment of bodies conforming to
no general pattern.
He illustrates that they do not have any general pattern and lie admits that:
It is of course wildly untidy, often
illogical, and impossible to describe.
His next remarks may, indeed, reflect the
way in which the British Government has
evolved. He makes this observation:
But it has made it possible to tailor the
organization to meet particular needs,
and as a result to make the administration acceptable to those concerned. But it
is fair to add that the degree of delegation of powers to Boards or Commissions
in the Intermediate Band does not usually
concern very controversial matters.
On practical grounds, I doubt whether
there is much to find fault with in this
part of the field, save the difficulty of
making it comprehensible.
[Hon. Mr. Thompson.]

Lord Bridges then goes into a description of
how the members thought there should be
more accountability on the part of boards,
and again lie describes how a select committee was set up in order to discuss that and
how it was ultimately decided to continue it
on an informal basis.
In summary, Lord Bridges is saying, however, that when the members wanted to
achieve accountability by informal ways they
could usually find the answers that they
wanted concerning boards and commissions.
In their concern they are doing a number of
studies under administrative boards. I refer to
one which I think would be of interest to
honourable senators. This is written by
Emmett Redford and bears the title Dem ocracy in an Administrative State. As I say, I
found that there is a very real lack of such
study in Canada.
I should like also to bring to the attention
of the Senate a study which has been proposed by Mr. Earl Carlyle Smith of York
University. He is hoping that be may get a
grant for this study, which would be his doctorate study, from the Institute of Public
Affairs. He wants to raise a number of questions about Crown corporations, and here I
should like to give an outline to honourable
senators of his approach to this subject.
First, he wants to look at Crown corporations as one aspect of general institutional
changes in parliamentary government. Under
this heading he wants to examine the reasons
for the emergence and growth of Crown corporations and to look at the classification of
Crown corporations. Then he is going to look

March 12, 1970

SENATE DEBATES

at the re-emergence of some traditional questions-the control by ministers and the element of flexibility which I discussed earlier
and which I said the British have. Then he
wants to look at the question of control by
Parliament of Crown corporations. Furthermore, he wants to look at the relationship
between Crown corporation directors, cabinet
ministers and Members of Parliament. His
question there is, who directs Crown Corporations? Further, he would like to study the
background and the socio-economic status of
Crown corporation directors and the attitudes
of Crown corporation directors towards
ministerial control, parliamentary control,
political parties and their own positions.
He would also like to find out the attitudes
of cabinet ministers towards the use of the
corporate form and control of Crown corporations and to discuss with Members of Parliament their attitudes towards the use of the
corporate form and the control of Crown
corporations.
I think this is very pertinent, particularly
in the light of the bill we discussed yesterday
concerning control of a Crown corporation,
the Company of Young Canadians, when we
think of the actions of the Quebec arm of that
organization, and also the discussions that
took place concerning the Quebec division of
the C.B.C.
Hon. Mr. Martin: This also refers to one of
the bills which we have discussed this afternoon and on which Senator Kinley has
spoken.
Hon. Mr. Thompson: There is another area
of discussion relating to public corporations
which he would like to look at. He would like
to see how they are used in other countries,
and the applicability of these innovations to
the Canadian political scene.
I was interested in reading about Sweden.
A Crown corporation can be established
there in order to engender competition with
private enterprise. They will establish a
Crown corporation to sharpen up private
enterprise.
Mr. Smith is also interested in a study of
accountability and control. His study raises
the question whether and how democratic
prospects and possibilities work in a society
when important decisions affecting individuals are made and carried out through public
administrative bodies. That is basically his
inquiry. I think this is the type of inquiry
which the Senate could very appropriately
study.

This is just one more area related to the
question raised by the report which the
Leader of the Government presented to this

complete attention, and I thank the Leader of
the Government for presenting it in this.

On motion of Hon. Mr. Argue, debate:

COASTAL FISHERIES PROTECTION ACT
BILL TO AMEND-SECOND

READING

Hon. Donald Smith moved the second reading of Bill C-134, to amend the Coastal Fisheries Protection Act.
He said: Honourable senators, let me say at
the outset that I do not intend to speak at
length in moving second reading of this bill. I
take this opportunity of reminding those
honourable senators who are left in the chamber at this hour on Thursday afternoon that
this is the third instalment of the fisheries
legislation now before us for our consideration. It is my hope that all three bills
will soon be referred to the appropriate committee of the Senate, which I believe is the
Standing Senate Committee on Banking,
Trade and Commerce.
I am given to understand that there is a
little more urgency about the Saltfish Bill that
received second reading this afternoon. I
should like to make a brief reference to that
particular subject, and I do so only for the
purpose of bringing attention to the great
contribution made to the debate by some of
our newer senators, as well as some who have
been here for a longer time. I refer particularly in the first instance to Senator Robichaud from New Brunswick. As honourable
senators are aware, many years ago Senator
Robichaud was an inspector of fisheries for
the federal department. Later he became
Director of Fisheries for the Province of New
Brunswick. After being a backbencher in the
Opposition during the Diefenbaker regime he
became Minister of Fisheries in the other
place and served his country well indeed.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Smith: I was impressed by the
speech he made the other day, not only by his
knowledge of the subject but by the reference
he made to major factors that seriously affect
fisheries, particularly his suggestions with
regard to the question of subsidy or assistance
for replacing worn-out wooden fishing vessels.
It was appropriate for him to remind us all

SENATE DEBATES
and to place on the record of this chamber
the numbers who are concerned in fisheries
who will perhaps not during their lifetime
have an opportunity to engage in the fishing
industry on one of the very large steel trawlers which are still subsidized; and his particular area of Nova Scotia happens to be one
of those. Lunenburg has gradually grown up
economically in the fishing industry, and their
fish landings, as in the case of Halifax, are for
the most part brought in by these larger steel
draggers. Of course, we can anticipate many
more helpful speeches from Senator Robichaud.
I also wish to make a brief reference to our
colleague Senator Kinley, who has engaged in
the debate on several of these bills already.
He deserves great credit for the energy with
which he attacks these subjects and for
expressing in rather strong terms his views
on these matters. I am sure the Whip on this
side has no hesitation in endorsing what I say,
when I assert that we can always depend on
Senator Kinley being in the chamber late on
Thursday afternoons, just as we can depend
on his attendance at committee meetings.
I am very proud of the second octogenarian
senator from Nova Scotia, as well as of
others, but I particularly want to refer to
Senator Isnor who has had problems of
health, mostly with his eyes, but who is now
back in full swing. I do not suppose there is
a more interested member or one who attends
sittings of the Senate more regularly and
more religiously than does Senator Isnor, and
I know that he is one of the most valuable and attentive members of the Committee
on Banking, Trade and Commerce. I am very
proud of these Nova Scotians, as I am sure
we all are.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.

act, to enter our ports for the purchase of
supplies and for servicing. I have been
informed that it is not intended to change the
present situation on the east coast of Canada.
The practice of admitting foreign fishing
vessels to the port of St. John's, Newfoundland, is one that goes back to pre-Confederation days, and was legalized by the enactment
of regulations under the act at the time of
union. Subsequently, this permission was
extended to ports in Nova Scotia.
The use made by foreign fishing vessels of
east coast ports for supply purposes is quite
extensive. During 1968, for example, 309
entered St. John's and 241 entered Halifax,
making a total of 550 foreign fishing vessels. I
might add that these numbers do not include
U.S. fishing vessels.
I have here a table prepared by the Department of Fisheries which is a breakdown of
the number of entries with respect to each of
the 16 countries involved. It might be useful
to have it appear in the record, so, with your
permission, perhaps it could be inserted at
this point in my remarks.
The Hon. the Speaker: Is it agreed, honourable senators?
Hon. Senators: Agreed.

Hon. Mr. Smith: Now I want to state very
simply that the purpose of this bill, which is
intituled an Act to Amend the Coastal Fisheries Protection Act, is to provide for the power
to regulate and control the entrance into
Canadian ports of foreign vessels which service and supply fishing vessels of other
nations. That purpose is to be accomplished
by an amendment to the present definition of
"fishing vessel", which enlarges it ta include
these service and supply vessels.
Canada now has legislative discretionary

[Hon. Mr. Smith.]

March 12, 1970

SENATE DEBATES

about this subject, which indicated that in
1968 the world catch amounted to an estimated total of 64 million metric tons. It is interesting to note that Peru took first place
among all the nations of the world that fish,
with a total catch of 10.5 million tons. Canada
was way down the list of important fishing
countries; in fact, it took eleventh place, with
1.5 million tons. I thought it would be interesting to put that information on the record
to indicate the great prospects there are for
increasing our own catch, even though we
may have to pay more attention in the future
to international regulations with regard to the
seasons and the areas which may be fished,
and work out agreements, just as we have
usefully done in certain areas.
For many years the international salmon
fishery on the west coast has been successfully controlled. Those who have been here
longer than some others will recall the active
part one of our late colleagues played in the
International Salmon Commission, in the
person of the late Senator Reid from British
Columbia. The large and valuable halibut
fishery on the west coast is fairly well controlled by international regulations arrived at
a few years ago. Preliminary steps are being
taken on the east coast also, but they are first
steps and we have a long way to go.
Some of us are quite concerned that one
country, and apparently only one, is holding
out on a similar form of international agreement with regard to the Atlantic salmon
catch off the coast of Greenland. A serious
problem is developing. It has been found by
scientists that salmon that have been taken in
very large tonnages off the coast of Greenland in recent years are the product of the
rivers of the east coast of Canada. I think
reason will eventually prevail and that this
very rich resource will be protected in the
future.
Those of us who live on the coast, and
particularly those who have had an opportunity to get to sea or fly over some parts of
the coast, are well aware of the rapid growth
in each of the post-war years of the fishing
by foreign vessels on the Continental Shelf
of the western Atlantic.
If circumstances were different, I am sure
we would be well advised to take a second
look at this permissive practice with respect
to the use of our east coast ports by foreign
fishing vessels, having in mind the priority of
attention which should be given to the flshing
industry rather than to the volume of trade
which has been accruing to the merchants in

the two main cities involved and some other
smaller ports, with one of which I am sure
the honourable
Senator Macdonald
is
familiar.
Hon. Mr. Martin: Would that be Saint
John, New Brunswick?
Hon. Mr. Smith: He will tell you.
However, in three respects circumstances
are quite different from those which exist on
the west coast.
In the first place, some of the richest fish
resources are located far beyond Canada's
territorial waters and the zones of exclusive
fishing jurisdiction. On the west coast, however, because the Continental Shelf is much
more limited in extent, the resources of fish
are very much closer to Canadian jurisdiction
and, therefore, they present more difficult
problems for Canadians. In the second place,
if you take a look at a map of Canada you
will realize just how close the French colonial
islands of St. Pierre and Miquelon are to the
coast of Newfoundland. No such circumstances exist on the west coast of Canada.
If Canada were to rescind the present regulations, thereby denying access by foreign
fishing vessels to east coast ports, the first
result would be a rapid deterioration in the
friendly international relations which have
existed for many years with such countries as
Spain and Portugal which, as will be seen
from the table I have placed on Hansard,are
the greatest users of our ports. Those who
have visited the fishing areas of Spain and
Portugal know that the fishermen there are
relatively poor, and of course, they will suffer
by being deprived of an economic source of
supplies. But, it would be a temporary setback only if they were to be cut off. I have no
doubt that France would immediately take
advantage of such an opportunity to develop
supply and service ports in her colonial
islands of St. Pierre and Miquelon. From that
point on, the foreign competition for fish
would intensify and our east coast ports
would lose an important trading business as
well.
Honourable senators, I sometimes wonder
whether Canada's sovereignty, defence, and
economic health would not be better served
by our attempting to acquire ownership of
those French colonial islands, rather than by
looking hopefully for the financial resources
to buy back foreign ownership of resources
and industries in other parts of the country.
Indeed, we may be missing an opportunity
such as was presented to the United States

SENATE DEBATES
with respect to the Louisiana Purchase many
years ago, or, indeed, the purchase of Alaska
which with its panhandle blocks a short
access to the Pacific from northern Canada.
The third difference in circumstances
between the east and west coasts of Canada is
in the fact that there are no historical rights
of fishing near the west coast such as exist on
the east coast.
All of these different circumstances have
caused the Government to come to the conclusion that not only must foreign fishing vessels continue to be excluded from west coast
ports, but that in future the power must be
obtained to control the use of British
Columbia ports by foreign supply and service
vessels as well. This does not mean that in
any or every case foreign supply vessels will
be denied entry. Indeed, it is my information
that the entry of Russian vessels into west
coast ports has been accompanied by very
fine co-operation in participating in conservation measures. The proposed amendment in
this bill simply places additional bargaining
strength in the hands of the Government in
its future international negotiations. This is
the policy that has been recommended by the
fishing industry of British Columbia, and by
the Fisheries Council of Canada.
I commend this bill to the favourable consideration of my honourable colleagues in this
house. In closing I say that if the bill receives
second reading I shall be very pleased to
move that it be referred to the Standing
Senate Committee on Banking, Trade and
Commerce for consideration.
Motion agreed to, and bill read second time.

DISSOLUTION

SECOND READING

Hon. Paul Martin moved the second reading of Bill C-161, to provide for the dissolution of the Dominion Coal Board and for the
repeal of the Canadian Coal Equality Act, the
Coal Production Assistance Act and the
Dominion Coal Board Act.
He said: Honourable senators will recall
that I moved the second reading of this bill
under the designation of Bill S-3 on October
30, 1969, at which time I gave an extended
[Hon. Mr. Smith.]

March 12, 1970

explanation of the reasons for the decision of
the Government to dissolve the Dominion
Coal Board and to repeal certain pieces of
legislation. The right of this chamber to
introduce such a bill was contested in the
other place, and as a result of a ruling of the
Speaker of the other place the bill that was
passed by this house was not dealt with there.
Clause 3(2) of the bill reads:
The provisions made by any Appropriation Act to defray the expenses of the
board shall be applied to such classifications of the public service within the
of Energy, Mines and
Department
Resources as the Governor in Council
may determine.
For the record, I should like to say that I do
not agree, as was argued and held in the
other place, that this is a matter which
involves the disposition of public moneys,
because this is a different appropriation from
that already made by Parliament. I do not
agree that such a measure in consequence had
to be preceded by resolution, and introduced
first in the other place. I say, I do not share
this opinion. This bill does not increase an
appropriation. It does not make any appropriation. It touches merely upon the disposition of money already appropriated.
Honourable senators, I do not intend to go
through the reasons for this measure which I
gave on another occasion. I would simply say
that the details of this bill are identical to
those of Bill S-3 which, as I indicated on
March 10 when this bill was introduced, was
dealt with by the Senate in 1969. However, it
will perhaps serve a useful purpose, if I briefly review the objectives of the bill that is
presently before us.
First, it does not mean that the coal industry, or our vast coal resources, are no longer
important to the Canadian economy. On the
contrary, the coal industry, particularly in
western Canada, is rapidly becoming an
industry of both national and international
importance. It is the intention of the Government to devote more effort towards research
and development, with the aim of promoting
a sound coal company in Canada; one that is
healthy and reliant, and that is not dependent
upon federal aid.
It is also the intention of the Government
to retain all of its expertise in coal, and
towards this end the staff of the Dominion
Coal Board will be utilized within the Department of Energy, Mines and Resources. That
department will strive to ensure that the coal

March 12, 1970

SENATE DEBATES

resources of Canada are utilized to the maximum extent.
I have nothing further to add. This bill was
not contested when it was first introduced. It
brings to an end the provisions contained in
Section 4 of the Dominion Coal Board Act
and repeals the Canadian Coal Equality Act,
the Coal Production Assistance Act and the
Dominion Coal Board Act. I am in the hands
of the Senate. If it wishes this bill to go to
committee, I have no objection, but I do not
think it should.
Hon. John M. Macdonald: Honourable senators, I have no intention of speaking at any
length to this bill because, as did the honourable Leader of the Government, I spoke to it
on October 30, 1969. There would be no purpose in repeating my remarks. However, if
any honourable senators wish to review them,
I refer them to the Senate Hansard of October 30, 1969. At that time I made some comparison of the type of assistance given to the
coal mining industry to that given to the gold
mining industry. I quoted the figure for assistance to the gold mining industry. At that
time the latest returns for 1969 were not in.
The total amount paid to the gold mining industry was not quite correct. I mentioned
that for the period 1948 to March 31, 1969,
the assistance given to the gold mining industry amounted to $260 million. The actual
figures were $261,293,250.09.
I see no purpose in sending this bill to
committee and would be quite prepared to
have it passed.
Hon. Mr. Martin: Senator Macdonald's
remarks on that occasion may be found at
page 822 of the Senate Hansardfor Thursday,
October 30, 1969.
Motion agreed to and bill read second time.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, when shall this bill be read the third
time?
Hon. Mr. Martin moved that the bill
be placed on the Orders of the Day for third
reading at the next sitting.
Motion agreed to.
AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS CO-OPERATIVE MARKETING ACT
BILL TO AMEND-SECOND READINGDEBATE ADJOURNED

Hon. Hazen Argue moved the second reading of Bill C-183, to amend the Agricultural
Products Co-operative Marketing Act.

He said: Honourable senators, I am pleased
to have the privilege of introducing this bill
at its second stage on behalf of my leader.
The amendment has been described in the
other place as a small but important amendment. It is an amendment which would give
to the Wheat Producers Marketing Board of
Ontario, if it desires, the opportunity to
obtain certain guarantees from the federal
Government for finance in the provision of
money for financing the handling, storage and
marketing of wheat in the Province of
Ontario.
The general objective of the Agricultural
Products Co-operative Marketing Act, which
this bill would amend, is to promote the
orderly marketing of agricultural products.
Under the legislation, a group of producers
wishing to market a product collectively may
enter into an agreement with the Minister of
Agriculture. These agreements provide for a
guarantee of bank loans covering initial payments, processing, carrying and selling costs.
Under the act the initial payments to producers must not exceed 80 per cent of the average price paid to producers according to
grade and quality over the three-year period
preceding the year of production. Equal
returns must be paid to primary producers
for agricultural products of like grade and
quality. Final returns must be made to primary producers of the proceeds of the sale of
the products after deducting processing, carrying and selling costs.
Many producer groups in different provinces have used or considered using this legislation from time to time. Since 1939 a variety
of agricultural products have been marketed
under the act. Chief among these have been
forage crop seeds, potatoes, fox pelts, fresh
apples, apples for processing, maple syrup,
tobacco and beans. At the present time there
are agreements under the provisions of the
act with respect to the marketing of processed
apples in Quebec and beans in Ontario.
The purpose of this amendment is to
include wheat other than that grown in the
designated area under the Canadian Wheat
Board Act. Wheat is excluded currently
because at the time this act became law all
wheat was under the Canadian Wheat Board
Act, which provides for initial payments,
pooling, et cetera. Since World War II, however, Ontario has not been part of the designated area under the Canadian Wheat Board
Act. It was withdrawn in the year 1947.
The Agricultural Products Co-operative
Marketing Act, which this bill seeks to
amend, was passed by Parliament in 1939. At

SENATE DEBATES
that time the Minister of Agriculture was the
Right Honourable J. G. Gardiner, who was
one of Canada's most outstanding ministers of
agriculture. Much of the legislation that he
presented to Parliament is still on the statutes. This act, some 31 years later, is being
used to provide certain assistance to wheat
growers in the Province of Ontario.
The Farm Products Marketing Act was
passed in the Province of Ontario in 1960,
under which an Ontario Wheat Board Marketing Agency was established. I wish to pay
tribute to the Province of Ontario for the
initiative it took in this regard. In particular I
pay tribute to Ontario for the kind of wheat
board act it bas had in operation in that
province for the handling of wheat. I have
read it and believe that it might be a model
for marketing legislation, either provincially
or federally, in the sense that it establishes a
democratic arrangement whereby the producers themselves elect the board and in fact
control the marketing of their own product. I
think that should be a first choice for all
parties, namely, that if producers are willing
and able to undertake the responsibility of
marketing their own product in a democratic
fashion, Parliament or legislatures should
then play the role of providing the legal
framework in which such action can take
place. I understand that the Ontario Wheat
Marketing Board has requested this kind of
amendment to our federal legislation so that a
federal guarantee for moneys for financing of
the Ontario board may be made available
with perhaps lower interest rates and with a
greater availability of money.
After having read the debates, I should
report to honourable senators that there appears to be a very decided difference of
opinion among the Ontario wheat producers
as to whether or not they wish to use this
kind of legislation, but apparently the board
has asked the federal Government to have
this kind of legislation adopted.

[Hon. Mr. Argue.]

March 12, 1970

The federal Government, I think wisely, is
taking initiative as a result of that request
and this is of course only permissive legislation. After it becomes the law of the land,
then the Ontario Wheat Producers Marketing
Board may or may not wish to sign a contract
with the federal Government, so that the
benefits that would flow from this legislation
may be available.
I have read that there is a good deal of
reluctance among the members of the Ontario
Wheat Producers Marketing Board to make
themselves available for part of this federal
plan, because there is fear that they may be
subject to greater regulation than might be
required. Therefore, they will make their own
decision in their own good time. However, I
think it is wise that this kind of legislation
for guaranteed financing should be made
available to the Ontario wheat producers
since this financing is already available for
the marketing of many other agricultural
products.
The wheat marketing situation for Canada
is extremely difficult, and while the Ontario
wheat producers, in my judgment, have not
experienced anything like the difficulty of the
prairie wheat producers, nevertheless, the
world wheat situation has had an effect on
the marketing of Ontario wheat and therefore
there has been a demand for this kind of
legislation.
I thought it might be of interest to honourable senators to have on the record a table
from the department showing the production
prices and sales of Ontario wheat over the
past number of years. This was not in the
record in the other place. I found it most
useful, and if it is agreeable to honourable
senators, it could be placed in our record at
this point.
Hon. Senators: Agreed.

ST. PATRICK'S DAY
TRIBUTE TO IRELAND AN)
IRISH PEOPLE

THE

Hon. Joseph A. Sullivan: Honourable senators, on a question of privilege I beg the
indulgence of the house for a few moments. A
rather monumental event occurred about two
weeks ago, with an eclipse of the sun which
foretold an event that would be occurring
today, the greatest day in the history of civilization, March 17, 1970.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Sullivan: Honourable senators, I
am going to take you on a trip to Ireland.
There is no language barrier, and asking for
directions is like a letter of introduction. It is
the friendliest country in the world and the
weather in summer is refreshing. The people
are delightful and every nook and corner is
as pretty as a park. You tour other countries;
you vacation in Ireland.
Start at Shannon and drive to Killarney in
the Kingdom of Kerry where they never
answer your question, but ask you anotherjust like politics. Kerry, where the mountains
dance at dawn, laugh, weep and weave their
spells. Kerry, where they have so much land
they "put it in hapes."
"Killarney," said Austin, "has all the world
over no superior." Queen Victoria called it
"fairy-land." Wordsworth wrote: "In point of
scenery this is the finest portion of the British
Isles." Added Lord Macaulay: "The gem of
Killarney, not a reflex of heaven, but a bit of
heaven itself."
In planning your journey be sure to drive
the Ring of Kerry, through Kenmare; lunch
at Waterville; visit Cahirciveen, the home of
Daniel O'Connell; see Dingle Bay and Castlemaine. On such a trip, wrote H. V. Morton,
"al round us the enchanted hills of Kerry, as
the evening turns them purple."
Killarney is the ideal place for strolling,
hiking, golfing, boating, sightseeing by jaunting car, or just plain resting. Muckross Abbey

March 17, 1970

(1348 AD) is there awaiting you. So is Ross
Castle, where Tennyson wrote "The splendor
falls on castle walls. .. "
"The myrtle in Kerry loves the soil," wrote
Macaulay. "The turf is of a livelier hue than
elsewhere. The hills glow with a richer purple... I never in my life saw anything more
beautiful."
Drive on to Cork City via Glengariff,
Bantry Bay, Skibbereen, Bandon and Kinsale.
The sights are as pretty as they are interesting. "You can see God in every turn of the
road," say the Cork people. And so you can,
for He is nearer than the door. The City of
Cork was founded by St. Finbar, in the
eighth century. It is rich in people, all of
them extroverts. Their wit is sly but their
hearts are warm. If you ask a farmer in Macroom how come there were no Jesuits in
Cork, fie will reply: "We attribute that to the
power of prayer."
Then there is the Blarney Stone. Drive to
Cobh, then north to kiss the Blarney Stone.
Cliodhna, queen of the fairies, gave it to
Cormac: "Kiss it and you'll never want for
words".
Cork's Bells of Shandon were immortalized
by Father Prout: "With deep affection and
recollection I often think of "those Shandon
bells. .. On this I ponder where'er I wander
and thus grow fonder, sweet Cork, of
thee . . "
From Cork City drive to Youghal, where
Sir Walter Raleigh was mayor in 1588. Stephen Rynne described it as "perhaps the most
fascinating town in Ireland, with its old quarter and its modern and fashionable seaside
addition." Go on to Coppoquin and the
famous Cistercian Abbey, Mount Mellary.
From there drive on to Waterford and the
cut-glass factory, and then on to Tramore and
Dungarvan, which Rynne describes as "one of
the finest coast drives in Ireland for colour
and cliff scenery."
From there go to Clonmel and on to Cashel,
in Tipperary. Cashel has the finest monastic
ruins in Ireland. From Tipperary go to Wexford, birthplace of Commodore Barry, father
of the American navy. Drive north through
Enniscorthy, Gorey, Arklow, and Wicklow. Be
sure to see Glendalough, the glen of the two
lakes, with its seven monastic ruins, where
Irish youth were trained as missionaries to
the continent in the eighth and ninth centuries. Nearby is the Vale of Avoca, so dear to
Thomas Moore: "There is not, in the wide
world, a valley so sweet as that vale in whose
bosom the bright waters meet".

March 17, 1970

SENATE DEBATES

Glendalough is in County Wicklow, the
garden of Ireland. From there it is only a
short drive to Dublin, which Morton
described as "an aristocrat among cities, with
an easy manner and a fine air of unstudied
elegance."
Dublin, the thousand-year-old capital, is
rich in associations: from Brian Boru in the
eleventh century, and from Strongbow the
Crusader to Dean Swift; from the Duke of
Wellington, who was born there, to George
Bernard Shaw, who was born outside; from
Curran, Grattan and Edmund Burke to Tim
Healy and Father Tom Burke; from Oliver
Goldsmith to Barry Fitzgerald; from Sean
O'Casey and James Joyce to Matt Talbot and
Padraic Pearse; from Wolfe Tone to Douglas
Hyde; from Synge and Yeats to James Stephens and Maud Gonne McBride; from
Robert Emmet to Kevin Barry; from Daniel
O'Connell to John McCormack; from Maureen
O'Hara and Margaret O'Brien to Sibyl Connolly and Siobhan McKenna; from Lady Gregory to Victor Herbert; from John Mitchell
and "Meagher of the Sword" to John Redmond and Michael Davitt; from the Normans,
the Danes, and Dublin Castle to Michael Collins; from Guiness's and the Abbey Theatre
to Irish Airlines: from Blessed Oliver Plunkett and the penal days to Frank Duff and
the Legion of Mary.
"Dublin", wrote Lynn Doyle, "is easy to
live in. If there is a pleasanter place in the
world post me a ticket. If you would learn
how jolly a holiday can be, go across for
Horse Show Week in July and go to the
dances every night, with their lights, laughter, mischief and gaiety."
Be sure to visit Galway Bay. It is very
pretty in the daytime, but prettier still when
the sun is sinking in the west, filling it with
brilliant golds, then glowing embers and
interminable Irish twilight. Be sure to see the
Cliffs of Moher in County Clare. Do not
forget Mayo, which furnished America's first
Cardinal, the Father of the Argentine Navy,
and a mayor of New York. "Mayo people get
places," wrote Rynne, "and they go far
toward making the world go round"-witness
the Mayo Clinic.
The scenery in Donegal is breathtaking.
Bring your golf clubs to Bundoran, if you
play golf, where the air is so salubrious that
no one ever dies except doctors-and they die
of poverty, my legal friends. Byrne summed
it up when he wrote:
We are a poor country as to money,
but we have purple heather and moun-

tains golden with gorse, and rivers, greatbosomed and friendly, where men may
dream.
They are good people in Ireland, and none
have been stauncher to their ancient faith.
But be careful-they will steal your heart

away.

SENATE DEBATES

virtue of any statute of the Parliament of
Canada, and to consider in connection therewith any public documents relevant thereto.
Hon. Hazen Argue: Honourable senators, it
is difficult for a layman to take part in this
kind of a debate where a legal training would
be of very great advantage. However, I do
hope that in my contribution I may be able to
bring a point worth considering before
honourable senators.
Although a committee of the House of
Commons in 1969 recommended a Commons
committee on Statutory Instruments, the
motion before the Senate seems to be
the Government's response to the important
recommendations of that committee. The
honourable leader (Hon. Mr. Martin) was
careful to point out that he was not making
that assertion. However, it would seem to be
quite logical that his action should flow from
the recommendation of the House of Commons committee. The Senate will be undertaking the very important work of this
committee.
The Government Leader presented this
motion to the Senate in a very eloquent
manner, and I think once again he has
demonstrated, in his capacity as Leader of the
Government in the Senate, that he is determined to give the kind of leadership that will
result in important activity being undertaken
at all times by this chamber. With this kind
of leadership the Senate will make a valuable
contribution and will be an enduring part of
the Canadian Parliament.
The leader, in making his presentation,
spoke as follows:
The report in question begins by
asserting that as a general rule there
should be public knowledge of the processes of delegated legislation before,
during, and after the making of regulations, and that any derogation by Government from this rule requires justification.

I have gone over the evidence of the House
of Commons Committee. I think the whole
question of a committee of Parliament looking at the law as it is initiated outside the
statutes is most important. If Canadian citizens are to be protected from high-handed
bureaucratic orders and regulations, some
kind of a review procedure is necessary.
There is a review procedure in the United
Kingdom. There is a review procedure in
Australia.
Evidence was presented before the Committee of the Commons to show that at least two
provinces in Canada have taken important
steps in this very field. I refer to the Province
of Manitoba and the Province of Saskatchewan.
While some honourable senators, in reading
the evidence which was placed before the
Commons committee, were impressed by certain parts of that evidence, I was particularly
impressed with that given by G. S. Rutherford, Q.C., outlining the Manitoba experience,
and C. B. Koester, Clerk of the Legislative
Assembly of Saskatchewan, outlining the experience in the Province of Saskatchewan.
The statutory review committee of the
Manitoba legislature has been in operation
since, I believe, 1960. Of all the presentations
which were placed before the Commons committee, I think the presentation by Mr.
Rutherford sums up, in a very short and
lucid fashion, the principles which were
used to test the justification and the validity
of regulations. I would quote, if I may, from
page 106 of the evidence before the Commons
Committee on Statutory Instruments, May 15,
1969. I read from Mr. Rutherford's remarks
as to recommendations approved by the
Legislature, as follows:
-The Standing Committee on Statutory
Regulations and Orders should, in examining regulations and orders submitted
to it, be governed by the following
principles:-

In other words, these are the principles that

(c) The regulations should not exclude
the jurisdiction of the courts.
(d) The regulations should not impose a
fine, imprisonment, or other penalty or
shift the onus of proof of innocence onto
a person accused on an offence.
(e) A regulation in respect of personal
liberties should be strictly confined to
things authorized by statute.
(f) The regulations should not impose
anything in the way of a tax (as distinct
from the fixing of the amount of a licence
fee or the like).
(g) The regulations should not make
any unusual or unexpected use of the
delegated power.
(h) The regulations should be precise
and unambiguous in all parts.
Now, the committee of the Commons has
rendered a service by setting forth its definition of the word "regulation" so as to show
it to mean much more than a Governor in
Council order. The definition of the committee
of the Commons as stated on page 1427 of its
Votes and Proceedings for October 22, 1969, is
as follows:
Your committee believes it would be
helpful to use the following description:
a regulation is a rule of conduct, enacted
by a regulation-making authority pursuant to an Act of Parliament, which has
the force of law for an undetermined
number of persons; it does not matter if
this rule of conduct is called an order, a
decree, an ordinance, a rule, or a regulation.

March 17, 1970

House of Commons, principles followed by
other committees dealing with this very question. I cite as a regulation that offends against
those principles the newly announced policy
to cut back wheat acreage on the prairies. I
think it is important, if we are to consider
the setting-up of this committee, that we
should consider a resolution which in my
opinion is opposed to the principles that have
been set up. From a careful study of the
evidence taken by the Commons special committee, and in the light of the principles used
to examine the validity and propriety of regulations made by regulation-making authorities
in the United Kingdom, Australia and the
provinces of Manitoba and Saskatchewan,
where sophisticated procedures for such examination are in effect, and on the basis of
established principles of law, I personally
question the validity and propriety of the
action about to be taken to establish a whole
new basis for wheat deliveries on the prairies,
designed to reduce acreage planted to wheat.
This new regulation, I suggest, should be
examined forthwith, on the passage of this
motion, by the Standing Senate Committee on
Legal and Constitutional Affairs, to determine
whether it is, as I think it to be, a classic
example of the kind of regulation that clearly
ought not to be made, and whether this regulation is improper, and is indeed illegal and
ultra vires of the Canadian Wheat Board
Act. The tests that the Senate committee
would give this resolution, following the principles recommended by the House of Commons Committee on Statutory Instruments
and following the principles of other bodies
that I have referred to, I suggest should be
somewhat as follows. Is the regulation to
establish summerfallow as the quota basis for
marketing wheat beyond the scope of the
Canadian Wheat Board Act? I think a strong
argument can be made that it is. The Commons committee said that one important criterion was whether or not these authorities
are authorized by the terms of the enabling
statute to make the regulations that they wish
to make. The Canadian Wheat Board Act sets
out the purposes in section 4 of the act as
follows:
The Board is incorporated with the
object of marketing in an orderly manner
in interprovincial and export trade grain
grown in Canada and possesses the following powers-

I take it from that very broad interpretation of the word "regulation" that the Senate
committee which will be established will have
a very broad authority to look at the various
regulations, whether they be Orders in Council, administrative directives or orders of
boards operating under a statute of Parliament.
This committee will have a very broad
and a very important authority, and I think
the Senate of Canada will perform this new
duty in a competent, efficient and effective
manner. I have no doubt that the country has
suffered and there have been injustices done
because there has not been over the years this
kind of body to consider the importance and
the effects of these regulations.
I wish to bring to the attention of honourable senators a particular regulation or rule And there follows a long list of powers.
Thus, the object of the Canadian Wheat
which I submit flies in the face of the various
principles laid down by the committee of the Board Act is to establish a system to market
[Hon. Mr. Argue.]

March 17, 1970

Marc 17,1970SENATE
DEBATES

grain, and neither ini section 4 nor in section
18, the Permit Book section, is there any suggestion-for is there any suggestion in section 20, which deals with powers-that the
Wheat Board has the power to force wheat
acreage reduction by penalizing the producers
who do not reduce wheat acreage.
Obviously, if the new regulation is beyond
the scope of the Canadian Wheat Board Act,
it will f ail to the ground on that basis, if for
no other. I would expect to see this regulation
challenged in the courts in the near future,
and I would think that the Senate committee
should inquire into whether or not a regulation passed by the Canadian Wheat Board
should be used to do something which 1 suggest is clearly not set out in the original
statute as being one of the purposes of the
Canadian Wheat Board.
As another principle and another test based
on these authorities, I would suggest the
following. Does the regulation contain substantive provisions that should be a inatter
of legisiation? Again, 1 would definitely think
it does. The new regulation turns the Canadian Wheat Board Act upside down; it turns
it in the wrong direction. In a large measure
it turns it from a wheat marketing instrument into a coercive wheat reduction instrument-coercive because a farmer who does
not summerfallow, who does flot reduce wheat
acreage, is denied a market for his wheat.
I suggest, therefore, that the regulation
offends on the grounds that it does contain
substantive provisions that should in fact
be a matter of legisiation. It is laid down
as a principle by these authorities that a
regulation should have no retroactive effect.
Here, with this regulation, there 15 definitely
a retroactive element. Twenty-five per cent
of summerfallow acreage of 1969-a year
ago-is part of the basis, and it is directed
to marketing a balance of the 1969 wheat
rather than current production. Therefore,
the regulation offends on the ground that it
is retroactive in effect.
Another principle is that the regulation
should not impose a fine or other penalty.
I suggest that here there is a substantial
penalty. If you do not summerfallow, a loss
of income is imposed. On a quota of eight
bushels per acre, there is an income loss
of about $10 an acre. This, I say, is a very
severe penalty, and on this ground, the
regulation offends. I suggest that the regulation as it is established is as if the Government
said to a Member of Parliament or to a Member of the Cabinet, "We owe you last year's

salary, but you can collect that salary only
provided you are prepared to work this year
without pay. If you do not work without pay,
you will not collect last year's salary."
As another principle, the regulation should
not make unusual or unexpected use of
delegated powers. I would suggest that it
off ends on this ground as well. This is an
unusual and unexpected use of delegated
powers. The announcement constituted a
bombshell, a shock, a complete alteration
of the Canadian Wheat Board policy that had
been followed throughout its 35-year history.
I say that on the principle that there should
be no unusual or unexpected use of delegated
powers, this regulation also does in fact
offend.
Rank and file producers-and I have talked
to many-resent having this measure forced
upon them by public announcement without
prior consultation and without any chance
to participate in the discussion. By the simple
device of a ten-minute announcement, a farmer's freedom to operate his own farm is seriously infringed, and if he should deviate from
this newly unveiled blueprint, he will be subject to an income loss of about $10 an acre.
It is stated in the report of the Commons committee that there should be public discussion
before important regulations are in fact proceeded with. I read from. page 1461 of the
report:
-your Committee therefore recommends
that, before making regulations, regulation-making authorities should engage ini
the widest feasible consultation, flot only
with the most directly affected persons,
but also with the public at large where
this would be relevant. Where a large
body of new regulations is contemplated,
the Government should consider submitting a White PaperThat is what should have been done in
this case. Personafly, I arn very pleased that
the Government submitted a White Paper in
the field of taxation. I am pleased that instead of going forward with major amendments that would have affected the Indian
population of this country, a White Paper was
produced and discussion is taking place. This
should have been done in this instance.
Another principle enunciated ini this report
is that any regulation should flot trespass
unduly on personal rights and liberties. It
seems to me that a Canadian in the ordinary
course of conducting his business should not
be subi ected to an unexpected announcement
of which he had no advance indication, and

SENATE DEBATES
which enunciates and proceeds to put into
effect a law which greatly interferes with his
normal action in the regular operation of his
business. I do not think that any authority
operating under a statute, whether it be the
Canadian Wheat Board or any other body,
should take drastic measures which interfere
with the day to day operation of the business of many Canadians without some advance
notice or public discussion, and without taking
them into their confidence and giving them a
chance to have a say. With no opportunity to
make representations, 188,000 producers received in the mail a one-page document which
outlines a drastic policy that will affect their
farm business in the present year.
I say in all sincerity that this is the kind of
coercive action that the Senate should consider an infringement of the basic rights of
Canadian citizens. If we do that and if we
take action to correct what we consider to
be an injustice, we shall be doing a service
to Parliament, to the Government, and to the
country.
Now I want to make it clear, honourable
senators, that I have no objection whatsoever to that part of the Government's policy
which in effect says to producers, we are
prepared to pay you $6 an acre if you reduce
your wheat acreage by a certain amount
and increase your summerfallow by a like
amount. The farmer would be free to make
his choice. During the last world war, the
government of the day felt that there should
be a reduction in the wheat acreage and
they offered to the wheat producers of
western Canada certain benefits. These were
offered under war-time circumstances but
without any coercion, without any penalty,
without any arbitrary interference in the
operation of the farm. Even at the height
of the wartime crisis, the farmer in his own
good judgment was able to decide to what
extent he would reduce his wheat acreage.
I think that if, once again this policy had
been followed, there would have been an
important reduction in wheat acreage. Farmers would have accepted this policy in a
pleasant and non-controversial atmosphere.
I hope that by bringing this particular
question to the attention of the Senate I have
not detracted from the general importance
of this action that we are about to take. It
would seem to me that in the years ahead the
Senate of Canada, through the Standing Senate Committee on Legal and Constitutional
Affairs considering statutory regulations, will
assure this fairness and will make it possible
[Hon. Mr. Argue.]

March 17, 1970

for people to enter into discussion prior to
their announcement, and when promulgated
it will be done legally, within the rules. This
has been the experience in Manitoba and Saskatchewan. Governments will heed a legislative committee which is undertaking to
impose on the administration and on the
boards that operate under statutes the kind
of democratic principles I have outlined and
which have been presented to the House of
Commons and to Parliament by the Standing
Committee of the House of Commons on
Statutory Instruments.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Grosart, debate
adjourned.
AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS CO-OPERATIVE MARKETING ACT
BILL TO AMEND-SECOND READING
The Senate resumed from Thursday, March
12, the adjourned debate on the motion of
Hon. Mr. Argue for the second reading of
Bill C-183, to amend the Agricultural Products
Co-operative Marketing Act.
Hon. John M. Macdonald: Honourable senators, with your permission I would yield to
the honourable Senator Pearson.
The Hon. the Speaker: Is it agreed, honourable senators?
Hon. Senators: Agreed.
Hon. Arthur M. Pearson: Honourable senators, we are dealing with Bill C-183, to amend
the Agricultural Products Co-operative Marketing Act. It is a very small amendment,
but one of considerable importance. This bill
pertains to the sale of wheat on a co-operative
basis in the Province of Ontario.
The Agricultural Products Co-operative
Marketing Act was promulgated in 1939 by
the Right Honourable J. G. Gardiner, the
then Minister of Agriculture. At that time
wheat was sold through the Canadian Wheat
Board. However, since the Second World War
the Province of Ontario, under this act, has
dealt with wheat separately.
I might say that the act does not make it
compulsory to belong to this co-operative.
Under this marketing act, the board, through
the Minister of Agriculture, may bar certain
areas of the province from participating if
it is felt that it would not be to that particular
area's advantage to sel wheat through the
Board.
The basic reason for the change proposed
in Bill C-183 is to enable the Ontario Market-

March 17, 1970

SENATE DEBATES

ing Board to obtain a government guarantee
for sufficient credit to make initial payments
on the purchase of wheat from its members
in Ontario. These initial payments may range
up to 80 per cent of the market value of the
class of wheat, based on the average market
value of that class during the previous three
years. However, there must be sufficient deducted from the initial payment to cover
the cost of storing, marketing and other expenses which arise as a result of the sale of
this wheat.
If the Ontario Wheat Marketing Board
wishes to make a final payment to its members, it must first approach the Minister of
Agriculture, and if he satisfies himself that
there are sufficient funds in that account to
pay expenses and still leave a surplus, then
the board is at liberty to make a distribution.
Honourable senators, I am a little disturbed
by this legislation which the minister says
has been requested by the Ontario Wheat
Marketing Board. This, in a sense, brings this
board under the direction of the Canadian
Wheat Board, because that is the agency
through which the minister advances the
credit; but in view of the fiasco that has arisen
in western Canada through the so-called surplus of wheat, I cannot see why any other cooperative group would want to be connected
with the present setup of our Wheat Board.
My only objection to the Wheat Board is
that it has become too satisfied with the type
of work it is doing. Too many statements
are made by men in the top echelons of these
boards and agencies without first making a
thorough study of what the matter entails.
For example, with regard to the so-called
$140 million which is going to be pumped
Into western Canada's economy, I doubt that
at the best it will exceed $50 million. There
are far too many "ifs" and "ands" to the
$6-acreage payment to be made for not growing wheat. I cannot consider it a good program, and I feel that many other farmers in
western Canada think the same way.
I would like to quote from an article that
appeared in the Regina Leader-Post of January 22. It states, in part:
Canada's agricultural industry has not
been market oriented in the past, Dr.
Gordon MacEachern of Ottawa, president
of the Agricultural Economics Research
Council, said.
"There has been little or no market
development by the agricultural industry

in Canada," Dr. MacEachern told delegates to the three-day convention in
Hotel Saskatchewan.
He said by marketing he did not mean
simply pricing or sending a few people
around the world "to see what was going
on.,,
There is a market potential for agricultural products not only in other countries, but right in Canada...
"Where does all this talk of surpluses
enter? Do we need only 150,000 farmers
in Canada or is this a ritual dance we
go through periodically?"
He said there were three important
questions for the agricultural industry to
answer.
First, what are the markets and market
potentials for farm crops?
Second, how willing and able are we
to compete with other markets?
Third, how well are other segments of
the agricultural industry equipped to do
their share?
Honourable senators, I feel that we are
being bound by socialistie ideals, and I am
afraid that our top men are gradually becoming socialistic in their ideas. They are
not thinking straight. As a result, the problems of agriculture become bogged down
more and more with these temporary palliatives which are being handed out. Instead,
we should organize a proper selling organization based upon free enterprise, and go out
and compete for markets. If other countries
cannot corne in with us on an orderly
market, then we shall have to go it alone.
If the farmers of western Canada and
Ontario do not start soon to do their own
thinking with regard to marketing they will
wake up some morning and find that they
have been socialized.
Hon. Walter M. Aseline: Honourable
senators, I have been expecting an honourable senator from the Province of Ontario
to rise in his place to take part in this debate,
but so far we have not heard from any
senator from that province. The bill was
introduced by Senator Argue from Saskatchewan, and it has been spoken to by Senator
Pearson, who is also from Saskatchewan.
Surely, some free-enterprise senators from
the Province of Ontario are interested in
this measure, and know whether the Ontario
wheat growers as a body are in favour of it.
I did not intend to speak in this debate, but

SENATE DEBATES
as no senator from Ontario has risen I think
I should say a few words.
As has been so well explained, the wheat
growers of Ontario belong to a marketing
board organized under the provisions of
the Farm Products Marketing Act, an
Ontario statute passed in 1960. The purpose
of Bill C-183 is to amend a federal statute
known as the Agricultural Products Cooperative Marketing Act, which has been
in force since 1939, by including wheat other
than wheat grown in the area that is defined
as the designated area by the Canadian
Wheat Board Act. If this amendment becomes law, then the provisions of the Agricultural Products Co-operative Marketing
Act will apply to Ontario wheat so as to
make it possible for the board to obtain
Government guaranteed bank loans with
which to pay the initial payments to its wheat
producers on the wheat delivered to it.
The Ontario Wheat Producers Marketing
Board has been getting along pretty well
with its own financing up to the present
time. I understand that it has sold the 1966
and 1967 wheat crops, but is having some
difficulty in disposing of those of 1968 and
1969. Prices are down, and the 1969 crop is
of a poorer quality and grade, and the board
is having trouble selling it. It is finding
difficulty in borrowing money with which
to pay the initial advances to producers.
By a vote the board will decide whether or
not it wishes to borrow money guaranteed
by the federal Government, and to enter
into the required agreement.
From reading the report of the debate on
this bill in the other place it appears that
there is some opposition to acquiring such
Government guaranteed bank loans, because
the agreement to be entered into would give
the Minister the power to regiment the whole
wheat marketing setup. That is something of
a very serious nature, because it takes away
from the primary producer the right to sell
his own product. That, in my opinion, would
be socialism. It would mean giving the Government the full right to run and control such
marketing. Some of the producers have expressed concern about the amount of power
that the department and the minister will
have under this proposed legislation. However, there is one redeeming feature. The
terms of the agreement will be made known
and a vote of the members will be taken before the agreement is signed.
Hon. Mr. McDonald: Hear, hear.
[Hon. Mr. Aseltine.]

March 17, 1970

Hon. Mr. Aseltine: If there should be too
much Government interference after the
scheme has been tested, and things do not
work out to the satisfaction of the producers,
the practice can be discontinued.
If I were an Ontario wheat grower and I
could not sel my wheat, even though I had
had some doubts and I did not want to give
up any of my rights as a free producer, I
would probably be willing to support the
amendment and give the scheme a fair trial.
However, there are some questions that I
think should be answered before this bill is
passed and becomes law. They are as follows:
1. How many primary wheat producers
are there in Ontario?
2. How many primary producers are members of the Ontario Wheat Producers Marketing Board?
3. How are the members of the board elected or chosen?
4. What are their powers?
5. Do the primary producers have any say
at all except through the members of the
board whom they elect?
6. What storage facilities does the board
possess?

7. Must a primary producer of wheat market it all through the board or does he have
other selling rights?
8. Have any producers asked to be heard
by a committee of the Senate, and should
this bill be referred to a committee?
Questions 3 and 4 can be answered by
reading the act itself, but up to this point I
have not had the time to read it. However,
I do think these questions should be answered. In view of the fact that there seems
to be some doubt, in my opinion it would be
advisable to have this bill studied by a committee, especially having regard to the fact
that it was not studied by a committee of
the other place, but in commit.ee of the

whole house. However, I would not so insist,
because I understand there is some urgency
in the passing of this bill, if no person has
asked to be heard.

Hon. Hazen Argue: Honourable senatorsThe Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators,
I must inform the Senate that if honourable
Senator Argue speaks now, his speech will
have the effect of closing the debate.
Hon. Mr. Argue: Honourable senators, I rise
to say that I think it is clear from the discussion in the other place that the passage of this

March 17, 1970

SENATE DEBATES

bill will merely enable the Ontario Wheat
Board to avail itself, if it so wishes, of the provisions of the act. There is nothing compulsory
in any way about this measure. It is merely
a response by the Government of Canada
to a request from the Ontario Wheat Board.
Due to the many questions that have been
asked, this bill should, after second reading,
be referred to the appropriate standing committee of the Senate where these questions
can be asked and the answers provided.
Motion agreed to and bill read second

PRINCE EDWARD ISLAND
TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF AGREEMENT
COVERING DEVELOPMENT PLAN

The Senate resumed from Thursday, March
12, the adjourned debate on the inquiry of
Hon. Mr. Phillips (Prince) calling the attention
of the Senate to the failure on the part of the
Government of Canada and the Government
of the Province of Prince Edward Island to
ensure the carrying out of all the terms and
conditions of the Agreement Covering Development Plan for Prince Edward Island, made
7th March, 1969, between the two Governments.
Hon. Paul Martin: Honourable senators, I
promised Senator Phillips (Prince) that I
would try to reply to his inquiry of Thursday
last. As he stated, the federal Government and
the Government of the Province of Prince
Edward Island signed on March 7, 1969, an
agreement for a 15-year development plan for
that province.
In light of Senator Phillips' comments, I
would like to review the administrative apparatus for the implementation of the plan,
which I am sure he fully understands. However, I gathered from what he said that there
might be some misunderstanding in that regard.
A Joint Advisory Board is charged with
overall responsibility for the implementation
and management of the plan. The board is
composed of both federal and provincial appointees. The Minister of Regional Economic
Expansion appointed the federal members and
the government of Prince Edward Island appointed the provincial members. The experience to date would indicate that the board

will probably meet three times a year, although meetings will be held more frequently
if necessary.
Responsible to the Joint Advisory Board
are the Joint Managers. The federally appointed Joint Manager is the Field Director
of the Department of Regional Economic
Expansion. The provincially appointed manager is Deputy Minister of Development for
the Province of Prince Edward Island. The
Joint Managers provide the secretariat for
the board meetings. Tentative programs under
the plan are submitted by the Joint Managers
to the Joint Advisory Board. In the development of these programs the Joint Managers
work very closely with the relevant provincial and federal departments and agencies.
Already
several joint federal-provincial
working groups have been established to
assist the Joint Managers in the development
and implementation of their programs.
Programs submitted to the Joint Advisory
Board are considered by that body in the
light of the objectives, strategies and priorities of the Development Plan. If the board
agrees to recommend the programs they are
then submitted, as I am sure Senator Phillips
(Prince) knows, to both federal and provincial Governments for approval. Since approval
of a program would involve the expenditure
of public funds, approval by the federal Government necessarily means the approval of
the Treasury Board in the first instance.
No sound administrative practice could provide for any other kind of arrangement.
Paragraph 4.3 of Schedule C to the Development Agreement, entitled "Public Participation and Involvement", provides for a
feedback of public reaction to the provincial
government and the management group.
This brief recital of the procedures in effect
in the implementation of the plan is essential
in order to put the argument of Senator
Phillips (Prince) in proper perspective.
Hon. Mr. Phillips (Prince): I thought I
had given all that the other day.
Hon. Mr. Martin: I wanted to put it in
complete perspective, because the conclusion
that Senator Phillips drew did not seem to
harmonize on re-reading his speech with what
he says was his understanding of the procedural arrangement, the way the moneys must
be approved, and so on.
He has suggested that the procedures in
effect are not those contemplated by the
agreement, but he presents no evidence to
support that view. He made a statement but,

SENATE DEBATES
having read his speech twice, I see no evidence whatsoever beyond the mere assertion
to substantiate the statement.
Senator Phillips also raised some questions
in connection with the Mill River Tourist
Complex. Apparently, a press announcement
was made by the provincial government indicating what facilities might be included in the
Mill River Tourist Complex, but it was never
stated that all proposed elements of the complex would necessarily be proceeded with. The
only proposal that bas been approved for the
Mill River Tourist Complex is a golf course,
and work is now in progress to bring it into
operation. Further proposals will be studied
by the minister in the light of the characteristics of the Mill River area in relation to the
overall development potential of West Prince.
The federal Government and the Province
of Prince Edward Island are interested in promoting tourism in West Prince.
Hon. Mr. Phillips (Prince): Before the
honourable senator leaves the Mill River project, I do not wish to interrupt him at an
inopportune time, but the leprechaun who
prepared his speech today I hope advised him
that at the very time that I was making my
inquiry in this chamber the Minister of
Tourism was advising the Prince Edward Island Legislature that the provincial government has not yet purchased the land on which
the woodcutting had been carried out. Could
the honourable senator comment on that before be leaves the Mill River project please?
Hon. Mr. Martin: I am not aware of that
statement. If the senator says that that is the
case, then it certainly will bear examination,
but I have not been so advised.
Hon. Mr. Phillips (Prince): Your leprechaun
has fallen down.
Hon. Mr. Martin: That is the assertion of
Senator Phillips (Prince). I hope that his
statement in that regard will be borne out by
evidence, because so far in his statementand I say this with great respect-he bas not
offered any evidence to substantiate the contentions he has made, except to off er these
mere assertions. I have always been of the
view that an argument by mere assertion is
not necessarily an effective argument.

March 17, 1970

Hon. Mr. Martin: I will be very grateful to
receive it.
The federal Government and the province
are both interested in promoting tourism in
West Prince and it was considered that Mill
River was well situated as a site for a public
golf course. It was therefore decided to go
ahead with this project prior to the completion of overall plans for the development of
tourist facilities in all of West Prince.
Senator Phillips (Prince) has commented
on the economics of the clearing operation for
the new golf course. It must be stressed that
the operations during this winter were for
clearing and not for the production of pulpwood and lumber as such. However, it proved
possible to salvage a considerable part of the
wood. I am sure that Senator Phillips (Prince)
would not object to this. The operations provided much needed jobs for local people at a
time when there is typically high seasonal
unemployment.
The total cost of the clearing operations is
estimated at $75,000, of which about $16,000
will be recovered from the sale of wood. The
federal Government is therefore committed to
share 75 per cent of the net cost-that is,
75 per cent of $59,000-for the clearing of the
fairway.
Senator Phillips (Prince) correctly pointed
out that the workers employed on the fairway
clearing were not hired through the Canada
Manpower Centre. However, this matter bas
been taken up by the joint Advisory Board,
I am told, with the provincial government to
ensure that Canada Manpower Centres will
be used in the future where practicable, as
stipulated in Article 10(a) of the agreement
covering the Development Plan.
Senator Phillips (Prince) also commented
on the cost of individual units in the Brudenell
project. The cost figures he presented were
somewhat inflated, since they include some
$300,000 worth of services which will provide
for many more units than are immediately
contemplated, but will permit a rational longterm development.
I can see from the reaction on Senator
Phillips' (Prince) face that I have fully convinced him of the position of the Government in this matter.

Hon. Mr. Phillips (Prince): If the Leader
Hon. Mr. Phillips (Prince): You will be
happy, I presume, with the transcript of the of the Government will join me at a meeting
proceedings in the Prince Edward Island of the Standing Senate Committee on National
Legislature. I will be delighted to send you Finance on this subject he will have fully
convinced me.

SENATE DEBATES

MOTOR VEHICLE SAFETY BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. William J. Petten moved the second
reading of Bill C-137, respecting the use of
national safety marks in relation to motor
vehicles and to provide for safety standards
for certain motor vehicles imported into or
exported from Canada or sent or conveyed
from one province to another.
He said: Honourable senators, the bill before us is one which affects us all. The automobile has developed from an odd-looking
contraption that frightened horses and annoyed or amused the general public to the
point where today it is a part of our lives. In
the fast moving society of today, the automobile is a necessity and not a luxury. We all
depend on this means of transportation, whether we use public transport or drive our own
car. However, with all the benefits that have
come to us on the credit side, there is also the
debit side, hence the need for regulations for
the safe operation and control of these most
useful vehicles. We know that fire, which we
could not do without, must be controlled, and
regulations and fire prevention measures are
an integral part of our lives. The automobile
similarly must be controlled, and this bill
will go a long way towards achieving this
control.
The substance of the bill has been a subject
of much important consideration by the Minister of Transport and by the responsible provincial ministers from each of the provinces.
At a federal-provincial meeting in September last year it was unanimously agreed
that the federal Government should assume
responsibility for safety standards for new
motor vehicles manufactured in Canada and
for motor vehicles imported into Canada. At
that time it was agreed that the provinces,
under existing legislation, would undertake
to ensure the safety of vehicles in use as well
as the safety of replacement and additional
parts of motor vehicles.
I would now like to explain the main
objectives of this legislation and provide some
brief explanation of the scope and nature of
the more pertinent sections.
Of the two main provisions, the first relates
to the establishment of mandatory safety
standards for new motor vehicles to protect
persons against injuries or death, and the
impairment of health by exhaust emission
and noise. National safely marks will be
affixed to all new motor vehicles manufactured in Canada. Such vehicles must be

manufactured in conformity with the prescribed standards. These same standards will
also be applied to all new vehicles which are
imported into Canada.
It might be interesting to note at this time
that similar legislation outlining safety standards bas been in effect in the United States
since 1966, and that the initial Canadian
safety standards will be in conformity with
those of the United States.
The bill defines a motor vehicle as any
vehicle designed to be driven or drawn on
roads by any means other than muscular
power. It does not include vehicles designed
for running on rails.
The bill distinguishes between a manufacturer, a distributor and an importer as
persons engaged in the business of manufacturing, distributing or importing respectively. Manufacturing includes the process of
assembling.
The bill will give the Government of Canada the authority to prescribe safety standards to regulate the design, construction or
functioning of motor vehicles and their components for the purpose of protecting persons
against personal injury, impairment of heaith,
or death. Twenty-nine standards have now
been prepared, which can be adopted as the
initial regulations under this legislation. These
standards deal with the main safety features
which would henceforth be incorporated in
all new motor vehicles for sale in Canada.
I understand it is hoped that the initial
regulations can be published within the next
two months and thereby become effective at
the time production of 1971 model year
vehicles commences.
Honourable senators, I think you will all
agree that the definiltion of safety standards
is most important. Section 2(l)(h) defines
safety standards as follows:
-standards
regulating the design, construction or functioning of motor vehicles
and their components for the purpose of
protecting
persons
against personal
injury, impairment of health or death.
Section 4 provides the Governor in Council
with authority to prescribe regulations to
reduce air pollution by limiting harmful
exhaust emissions from all new motor vehicles. In recent years, measurements in North
America have indicated that motor vehicles
contribute more than one-half of the harmful
carbon monoxide, oxides of nitrogen, and
unburnt hydrocarbons contaminating the air
we breathe, particularly in the large cities.

SENATE DEBATES
Evidence is now available that these pollutants contributed by motor vehicles can be
very substantially reduced or entirely eliminated by realistic enforcible regulations. It
is my understanding that the Department of
Transport is now preparing a motor vehicle
exhaust emission control standard for inclusion with the other 29 safety standards in the
initial regulations.
The definition of safety standards in section
2(l)(h) of the bill also indicates that regulations can be issued on automobile bumpers to
the extent that such regulations help alleviate
or prevent personal injury or death to vehicle
occupants or pedestrians. The bill will be the
establishment
of standards on bumper
heights, on their energy absorbing characteristics and on the design of truck rear bumper
under-ride guards.
It is my understanding that the Department
of Transport now has such bumper standards
under consideration. When such standards are
published, as would appear likely within the
next year or two, they would, in addition to
protecting persons against injury and death,
undoubtedly have a secondary effect of protecting the vehicle body against damage in
and thereby reducing
minor collisions
automobile repair and maintenance costs.
I referred earlier to the provision for the
establishing of national safety marks. Under
the act, the use of the national safety mark
will imply compliance by the motor vehicle
and its components with the prescribed safety
standards. Both the form of the mark and its
location on the vehicle will also be prescribed,
and, most important, misuse of the marks will
be an offence.
The manufacturers and distributors are
prohibited from selling or possessing vehicles
which possess the national safety mark but
which do not comply with all safety standards applicable at the time the vehicle was
manufactured. They are also prohibited from
sending or conveying from one province to
another motor vehicles to which this mark
has not been applied.
Motor vehicles which are imported into
Canada will be required to prescribe to the
safety standards. They will be required to
comply, at the time of importation, with the
prescribed safety standards applicable at the
time the vehicle was manufactured. Hence,
used vehicles, manufactured after the proclamation of this act could be imported, but only
if they complied with the regulations. Thus
any individual or company importing a new
or used vehicle would have to produce evi[Hon. Mr. Petten.]

March 17. 1970

dence that the vehicle complied with the
regulations applicable at the time it was
manufactured.
For example, any person who visits Europe,
or any other area outside Canada, and purchases a vehicle there after these safety
standards come into effect will have to provide evidence that the vehicle meets the
required Canadian standards if they wish to
bring the vehicle back into Canada.
It should be pointed out that these safety
standard regulations will not apply to vehicles being brought into Canada temporarily
for the purposes of exhibition and demonstration nor to vehicles being used by tourists or
visitors entering or passing through Canada.
Earlier I indicated that the bill contained
two main provisions, and I have described in
some detail the provision relating to motor
vehicle safety standards. The second major
provision of the legislation will require manufacturers to notify all vehicle owners, of
whom they are aware, of any defects coming
to their attention which are likely to affect
the safe operation of a vehicle. Manufacturers
must also advise their dealers and agents of
the defect, the safety risk involved and the
method of correcting it. This defect notification provision, which is based upon the federal Government's authority in the area of
criminal law, provides the Government with
powers by which it may regulate the safety of
vehicle construction not covered by prescribed standards.
The act also provides for the Minister of
Transport to forward full particulars contained in the notice of defect to the responsible provincial authorities.
Section 9 of Part 1 of the act requires that
all regulations proposed by the Governor in
Council be published in the Canada Gazette.
It also requires, and I am quoting:
a reasonable opportunity shall
-that
be afforded to manufacturers, distributors,
importers or other interested persons to
make representations to the minister with
respect thereto.
As the documentation supporting each regulation is expected to be lengthy and of considerable detail, it is hoped that this provision
will prevent any possible technical errors in
the regulations and will also allow industry
some time to insure that their products
comply.
Honourable senators, the administration of
this act provided for in the bill gives the
Minister of Transport power to designate
inspectors to enforce the safety regulations

March 17, 1970

Marc 17.1970SENATE
DEBATES

which will corne into existence. It gives themn
the powers of search, seizure and ultimately
of forfeiture if there is a conviction under the
act. Thus, the act provides the Government
with power to enter places where motor vehidles and their components are manufactured
or stored for the purpose of inspecting both
vehicles and applicable records.
The fines as outlined in section 17, ranging

Up to a maximum of $200,000 for various

violations, should be conducive to compliance.
While this act gives the Government the
necessary authority to regulate in an area so
directly concerned with public safety, I arn
pleased to note that an annual report will be
made to Parliament on this act. Tabling of
this annual report may provide members of
both houses with an opportunity to review
the
regulations
andi
to
suggest new
regulations.
I believe that this is perhaps one of the
most significant pieces of legisiation to corne
before this chamber in the past few years. It
would seem to me to be a positive step in the
right direction in so far as automobile safety
is concerned, and I endorse it wholeheartedly
as I arn sure all Canadians will.
Hon. Edgar Fournier: Honourable senators,
1 was hoping at this late hour to adjourn the
debate, but I understand that the authorities
want me to carry on and since I always try to
please them, I wiil try to carry on.
Hon. Mr. Martin: The senator always does.
Hon. Mr. Fournier (Madawaska-]Restigouche): I do not always feel like it, but I try to.
Hon. Mr. Martin: That is why I try to give
quick answers to your questions.
Hon. Mr. Fournier (Madawaska-Restigouche>: I would like to thank Senator Petten for
explaining the bill to us. Indeed, he did a
good job considering what hie had to work
with. He gave us a good explanation of the
automobile standards, which I fuily support
because it is lime we established safety standards that will protect ahl persons.
Before I talk about the bill itself, I would
like to briefiy review the history of the
automobile. Our generation has witnessed the
evolution of the automobile. We have seen the
tremendous change its development has
brought to the world. Usually when we talk
about the early development of the motor car
we think about the nineties, but actually the
first power-driven motor car was invented in
1770 by Captain Nîcholas Cugnot, an army

engineer, who made a steamn car for the purpose of transporting artillery ammunition. The
car would travel at six miles per hour and
could operate for 12 to 16 minutes. Then it
was necessary to stop it and bu.ild Up the
steam pressure again.
In 1781 the samne engineer bult another car,
a three-wheeler, of 2J tons. It was too heavy
in the front, out of balance, and it was demolished against a stone wail. It seems that we
do these things today with our new and
better balanced cars.
In 1863, after a lapse of about 70 years,
Sylvester Ropes designed a steam car weighing 700 pounds, which could travel at 20
miles an hour. It had storage under the seat,
holding enough coal for one day.
Then we go on to 1888, when Dr. John
Dunlop invented the first tires. They were
used on horse-drawn vehicles, and they were
claimed to be a major improvement in riding
comfort and safety.
In 1895 Dr. Curtas Booth of Youngstown,
Ohio, bult a car which was called a physician's carniage. It was his own design. It had a
one-cylinder engine of three horsepower.
It was a four stroke internai combustion
engine and had a top speed of 16 miles an
hour.
In 1893 we saw the first patrol wagon, the
Black Maria, as we called them, built in
Akron, Ohio. It was an electrie car with two
motors, operating on 52 batteries. This car
lasted for aine years.
In 1903 we had what we cail the famous
Glidden Tours, when 33 cars started fromn
New York City on a trip to White Mountain,
New Hamphisre, the round trip totalling 871
miles. 0f those, 28 cars finished in eight days.
The winner was nobody else but Mr. Perry P.
Pierce, maker of the famous Pierce Arrow,
which was known in our younger days.
A New York newspaper had this to say:
The trip did more to break down prejudice against motor cars than could be
done by hundreds of speeches.
Also in 1903 there was the first transcontinental trip. Dr. Nelson Jackson and Sewall
Crocker took part. It took 63 days, New York
to San Fransisco, and during that lime they
had the assistance of horses only three times.
In 1910 we saw the first armoured car. It
was built by the Bellemore Armored Car
Company of New York City, and they
claimed it gave full protection.
In 1916, there was a truck endurance run.
A li ton truck loaded with a ton of condensed

SENATE DEBATES
milk travelled from Seattle to Washington,
D.C. in 31 days, proving that truck transportation was successful even under very difficult
conditions.
In 1922 we saw the arrival of balloon tires,
which soon became standard equipment.
In 1923 we had the first headlight dimmer
switch. In 1928 the first cloverleaf interchanges appeared on our highways, being
constructed on the New Jersey and Lincoln
Highway. This was considered a great
achievement.
In 1936 came the greatest event of all,
never to be forgotten-parking meters. These
came from Oklahoma City and were invented
by Carl Mayer.
Honourable senators, we go back now to
the early 1900s, the period of evolution in
which we have lived. We have heard such
names as Henry Ford and Thomas Edison.
Ford was not an inventor, he was a businessman, while Edison was an inventor and more
of an electrician. We also note that Ford died
a very wealthy man while Edison died poor.
We know that Ford did not invent the first
car, but was the first man to put cars in
production and was also the first to pay $5 a
day to his employees-which everybody
thought would be the ruin of the country.
Ford was also credited with inventing the
planetary transmission which is still in use
today. It was the old transmission consisting
of the three pedals which the driver used to
push on the floor boards.
This method of transmission still operates
today, but it is a different system. It has
become an automatic transmission, and is
operated by oil pressure. We do not use the
pressure of the foot as in the old days. The
differential was not invented by Ford.
Other names associated with the early days
of the car industry were Mott and Durant of
Flint, Michigan. At the entrance of the Flint
Michigan Institute there is a great picture,
measuring 6 feet by 8 feet, of Mr. Mott driving one of these cars. It is nothing less than a
horse buggy with a little engine under the
seat. He is driving by two ropes tied to the
axles and he is going over a muddy street and
there is a policeman on a bicycle trying to
chase him off the road. Mott had a great deal
to do with the inventions on new cars.
A group of young fellows in the early 1890s
obtained small one-cylinder engines at Detroit
for a few dollars each, and were designing
their own cars from horse buggies. They
would put an engine under the seat, use
ropes, flat belts, and pulleys to drive the
[Hon. Mr. Fournier (Madawaska-Restigouche).]

March 17, 1970

wheels. They would steer by the ropes, and
they would play with these things on the
streets. This is how cars started.
Mr. Durant had great business ability, and
he eventually became a millionaire. He left
New York on an ocean trip. He lost his fortune because his factory failed, but before he
reached the other side he was again a millionaire, having made a million from somewhere else. His name is well known in the
car world. There is a monument to Mr. Mott
and Mr. Durant in Flint.
We also recall the names of Henry Chevrolet, Albert Champion, and Walter Chrysler,
who was a millwright. There was Mr.
McLaughlin, who made his own car, a Buick,
which became the McLaughlin-Buick. Other
names of American cars were coming on the
market: the Maxwell, the Durant, the Star,
the Grey Dort, the Hupmobile, the Studebaker, the Hudson, the Cleveland, the Simco, the
Essex, the Velie, the Reo, the Stutz, the
Packard, the Briscoe, and many others.
Many of these names have disappeared but
I think they will recall memories, because
some of us have at one time owned or driven
some of these famous cars.
Then came the Cole Front drive car, but it
did not last long. In between there were two
famous steam cars, the Stanley Steamer and
the Brooks Steamer.
We have also to recall the Fisher Brothers
of Flint, Michigan. Mr. Fisher himself was the
father of three sons. He was a blacksmith and
he welded wagon axles. His three sons
designed a wagon and put an engine in it to
play with on the road. This is how the Fisher
Body was first developed, and it became very
famous. It provided the automobile industry
with good solid car bodies. There was nothing
like Fisher bodies at one time.
Going back ta old memories, many of us
still remember the carbide and kerosene
lights, the old clincher round rims, the pump,
and the patches to do the tire repairs whenever a tire blew out.
There was the system where the gasoline was fed to the engine by gravity. You
had to go up hills in reverse, otherwise the
gasoline would not run from the tank.
There was the oil splash-oiling system,
followed by the development of the universal
joint. Then there was the advent of the cone
leather clutch. Just imagine! Cars had a
clutch and the driver could cut the power
from the movement of the wheels. This old
clutch consisted of two cones, somewhat like
ice cream cones, which fitted one into the

March 17, 1970

SENATE DEBATES

other. The types of construction was open
underneath and, if there was difficulty
because of mud or rain and the clutch began
to slip, the driver simply got out of his car,
picked up a handful of sand, got underneath
the car and threw the sand into the clutch,
thereby obtaining clutch friction at least until
the sand wore out and the clutch dried out
sufficiently to work on its own again.
There were other troubles in those days,
such as the splitting of the pinion gears at
key-way slot, and broken axles and driving
shafts. This latter was quite common. There
were external rear brakes at that time, and
also it was necessary to hand crank a car to
start the engine. If the spark was not retarded
properly, the person cranking might well end
up with a broken wrist because of kickback.
Then there was the old model T-Ford which
carried four dry cells for starting purposes
and then shifted onto magnetos once it was
started.
Those are a few of the things we lived with
in those days, and it is pleasant to recall
them.
Many of those old things were replaced.
The old lights were replaced by electric
lights. There was the advent of removable
rims for tire changes. A new force-feed
system of oiling did away with the splash
system, and new roller bearing universal
joints came in.
The old clutch was replaced by a disk plate
clutch and then by the single plate and multiplate clutches. There were all kinds of things
that were tried in the way of clutches, finally
followed by the fluid drive which we have
today. The old internal brakes were developed into four-wheel brakes. The old gas
pump was replaced by a new vacuum-type
gas tank which worked on a gravity system,
drawing the gas from the tank through a gas
line into the engine.
The initial model T-Ford shift pedal,
which we are still using today, was later
changed to a hand shift. That was then followed by another type of transmission which
we called the synchromesh transmission
which was silent. It was possible to shift
without any grinding of gears. That later
developed into the famous hydromatic transmission as we have it now.
In the cars of today we have beauty, comfort and speed. As far as dependability is
concerned, there is a question mark on that
one.
The whole economy and our way of life has
changed with the advent of cars. The popular

craze of the Sunday afternoon drive was
probably responsible for the desire to have
automobiles, but in any event we soon
became the victims of erroneous advertising
and we have never recovered. In those days
brakes were in a developmental stage, and
one company after the other would advertise
some new brake system, describing it in
glowing terms with pamphlets and posters as
the safest and most proved brake system, the
one you really needed. Everybody would fall
for the advertising and buy this latest equipment only to find that the very next year the
same companies were bringing out still another new type of brake system supplanting the
old. Again, everybody would buy the newest
development. That went on for years and
years before we suddenly realized how stupid
we were and that we were being taken for a
ride.
Throughout all this developmental period
there were many failures. I remember them
very wefl because I used to work in a garage
in the early thirties and I know what I am
talking about. Nevertheless, I remember well,
too, that in the early thirties, when we had
the Fisher bodies, it was not uncommon for
cars to roll over on the highway, but very
little damage resulted from such accidents.
Most of the time there would not even be a
dent in the top and the windows would not be
broken. If you rolled a car over today, all the
windows would be smashed and the roof
would be dented in. So we have lost something somewhere along the line. I wish to tell
you where we lost it. Cars no longer are
capable of carrying their weight upside down.
Doors which were once solid are no longer so.
Today we sacrifice strength for ornamentchrome and nickel, and we ride in nickel and
chrome-plated tin cans.
Is it not strange that we have failed to
improve the consumption of gasoline, when it
is well known that there is enough energy in
one gallon of gasoline to drive an average car
a distance of 450 miles? And yet the only
distance we get out of one gallon of gasoline
in the average car is between 12 and 15 miles,
or sometimes 20. Why have we not designed a
carburetor that can take advantage of the
energy we know is in that gasoline? We know
how, but apparently we are not allowed to do
so, and I am sure you know the reason why
as well as I do.
The same argument holds with respect to
tires. It is well known that millions of dollars
have been spent by the tire manufacturers to
produce a tire that will wear out in less than
20,000 miles. Is this what we cal improvement,

SENATE DEBATES
this planned obsolescence? We have certainly
improved the looks, but we have sacrificed
the strength; we have improved the finish,
but we have sacrificed the workmanship.
If you compare a 1970 car with a 1930 car
you will see that the workmanship and fitting
of the doors and hood and trunk of the old
car is vastly superior to that of the new. In
those days customers were very particular
about the fit of the various parts of the car,
and cars were produced to satisfy the customer. But today, with mass production, such
things as doors, far from fitting properly,
leave room for your fingers to fit through. We
have improved the finish but we have sacrificed the workmanship. We have improved the
speed but we have sacrificed control. We have
improved design but sacrificed safety. We
have improved production but have sacrificed
cost.
The picture as we see it today is that our
cars have killed more people in Canada and
the United States than any war or any disease
and we are still killing people at a tremendous rate. In Canada it is at the rate of about
5,000 a year, and in the United States that
number is increased by a factor of ten. It is
over 50,000 there. This is a picture we sometimes fail to see. But in our hospitals across
Canada today there are approximately 40,000
beds taken daily by people hurt in car accidents. That is a tremendous number of beds.
There are 135,000 people convalescing from
car accidents, and last year there were
172,000.
It is interesting to note that if one were to
pile the new cars that are demolished every
year one on top of the other for a height of
100 feet, the resulting pile would fill an area
one mile square. I know that sounds unbelievable, but it is a fact.
Hon. Mr. Bourget: I am interested in what
the honourable senator is saying, and I should
like to know where he gets his statistics.
Hon. Mr. Fournier (Madawaska-Restigouche): From the National Safety Council in
Chicago and in Ottawa. I will read from those
statistics in a minute. We often see in the old
countries war cemeteries with 5,000 or 6,000
little white crosses and we contemplate how
awful it is. But if we viewed the situation in
Canada in its proper perspective we could
imagine a new cemetery every year in
Canada with 5,000 white crosses, simply for
those killed in car accidents. That is not
exactly a rosy picture.
Now, it is a fact that in Canada, as you will
be pleased to hear, in 1969 there was a
[Hon. Mr. Fournier (Madawaska-Restigouche).]

March 17, 1970

decrease in car accidents despite the fact that
there was an increase in the number of cars
put on the roads. I should now like to put on
record a summary of highway accidents in
Canada for January to September. It is not
completed owing to the fact that the Dominion Bureau of Statistics could not supply figures for October, November and December.
Despite the sharp rise recorded during
the second quarter of 1969, traffic deaths
and injuries at the end of the third quarter resumed the downward trend that
became evident as early as the fall of
1968. The increases in traffic deaths and
injuries for the first nine months of
1969-over the corresponding period in
1968-stand at 0.3 per cent and 3.5 per
cent respectively. Canada's motor vehicle
population increases at the rate of
approximately 6 per cent annually.
However, property damages accidents
and total accidents continued to rise
sharply: 14.5 per cent and 11.8 per cent
respectively.
Four provinces recorded fewer deaths.
They were: Quebec (-18); Manitoba
(-28); Saskatchewan (-31); and British Columbia (-50).
Fewer injuries were reported in P.E.I.
(-67); N.B. (-135); Quebec (-902);
and Saskatchewan (-328).
Only P.E.I. and N.B. recorded a
decrease in property damages

accidents

and total accidents.
Possibly one reason for this is that we have
had Liberal Governments for so long in the
two provinces that we cannot drive new cars
any more.
Hon. Mr. Martin: Up to now you have been
very scientific.
Hon. Mr. McDonald: Maybe it is that you
have better roads there.
Hon. Mr. Fournier (Madawaska-Restigouche): I have the statistics here from the Highway Safety Council in Ottawa, and since 1967
there has been a decrease in the number of
accidents with 5,379 dead on the highways
while in 1968 it was 5,224, a decrease of
slightly over 100. It was a slight drop anyway.
However, the reported injuries in 1967 were
165,664 and in 1968, 172,795. Property damages went higher by an increase of about $28
million. In 1967 it was $332,684 million and in
1968 it was $366,619 million.

March 17, 1970

Marc 17.1970SENATE
DEBATES

So, honourable senators, as I said, I arn in
favour of the bill although 1 amn really disappointed because it does flot tell one very
much, and I like to know, like many other
Canadians, what is in the bill. It consists of 10
pages and 21 clauses. I do not know if it was
drafted by someone who was carried away by
emotion or political ambition, but he surely
failed to tell us what it is going to do in one
way. I want to be specific. There are 29
recommendations whiich are not; in the bill
but should be there. You can find them at
page 3016 in the House of Commons Debates
of January 29. When I look over these recommendations, I do flot find anything like 29. 1
have difficulty i finding a dozen, and I wil
tell you what they are and how I read them.
They are numbered here, and I do flot know
how they got this number. The numbering is
101, 102, 103 and the last one is 301. Numnber
101 is to control location and identification.
Now, I do not know what that has to do with
the safety of cars.
Hon. Mr. Martin: What section was that?
Hon. Mr. Fournier (Madawaska-]Restigouche): It is Hansard, Debates of the House of
Commons, January 29, page 3016. In one of
those recommendations, No. 115, it says:
"Vehicle Identification Number". So, these two
should be together. Why should we separate
thern? What are we looking for-publicity, or
action, or are we trying to build sornething
with nothing? Then we have No. 102"Transmission Shift Lever Sequence, Starter
Interlock, and Transmission Braldng Effect." I
agree with this one.
Then we corne to No. 103-"Windshield
Defrosting and Defogging Systems" and No.
104-"Windshield Wiping and Washing Systems?" Those two should be put together. We
are talking about windshield defrosting systems and windshield washing and wiping systems. Why do we have two different
recommendations?
Then we corne to No. 105-"ýService Brake,
Emergency Brake" and No. 106-"Hydraulic
Brake Hoses" and then we see No. 116 "Motor
Vehicle Hydraulic Brake Fiuids". They should
be ail together in one group. There is no
question about that.
No. 107 is "Refiecting Surfaces" and No.
108-"Lamps,
Refiective
Devices
and
Associated Equipment". Later we see No.
205-"Glazing Materials". Under the recommendations you have three specific recommendations and yet you are deahing withi the
samne material and the same items. No. 109 is
"New Pneumatic Tires" and No. 110-"Tire

Selection and Rims". Again these deal with
the saine subject and should be grouped
together.
No. 111-"'Rearview Mirrors" and No. 112
"Headlarnp Concealment Devices"-I would
like to know what they mean by that. I know
this much, honourable senators, that if we are
not careful we may find that the price of our
cars will increase by a couple of hundred
dollars. They will not be giving these things
to us for nothing. I notice my good friend
Senator Petten mentioned that somebody is
trying to do something about putting something into our exhaust to reduce carbon
monoxide. This is not going to be given free.
It will add another $65 or $70 to the price of
the car. Those of us who know sometbing
about this know very well that we can soive
the problem of carbon monoxide in the
exhaust very easlly because it is produced by
a lead content gasoline. The iead content
gasoline is used to prevent pre-ignition
because the compression is too high. By using
standard gas we can do away with the lead
content gasoline. We do not have to have
these devices that are going to cost a lot of
money. So we have to be careful about what
we are doing.
Then we corne to No. 113-"Hood Latch
Systems", which I think should be coupled
with No. 206-"Door Latches, Hinges and
Locks". No. 116 should already be coupled
with others. No. 201l and No. 202 deal with
"Occupant Protection in Interior Impact" and
"impact protection for the driver fromn the
steering control system?" No. 202 deals with
"Hlead Restraints". I suppose that is what we
cail a headrest. Speaking of headrests, at
times I think people are carried away by
emotion and even the Safety Coundil in
Ottawa is sometimes carried away by emotion. When safety belts came in, everybody
went crazy about them. We spent over $50
million in advertising safety beits and yet
they are used by less than 10 per cent of the
people because there was evidence that in certain circunistances the safety beit can be the
cause of fatalities. In other cases they have
saved a lot of lives, I agree, but there is the
other side; so it is an on-balance affair, and
before we jump to any conclusion we want to
look at both sides of the picture. Headrests
are not to me much of a safety device and I
will tell you why. First of ail it has a tendency to luil the driver into drowsiness. You sit
comfortably and you ride and you stretch out
and you drive and you go to sleep. I do not;
thînk that you should feel that much comfort
when you drive, any more than you would

SENATE DEBATES
drive with a big overcoat on. You want some
flexibility and movement, so I would not want
to drive a long distance with a headrest, unless I was sick or tired-and then of course
I would not drive.
Hon. Mr. Martin: Sometimes people go to
sleep for other reasons!
Hon. Mr. Sullivan: Honourable senators, you
might be interested to know that more whiplash injuries occur in cars with headrests
than in those without them.
Hon. Mr. Fournier (Madawaska-Restigouche): I have read somewhere that the medical
profession is not in favour of the headrest, for
safety reasons. In some places they are beginning to take out the headrests in police cars
because they obstruct one's ability to look to
the rear.
Then I come back to No. 204: "Steering
Control Rearward Displacement-Passenger
Cars."
Here is a group that is fascinating, Nos.
207, 208, 209 and 210. They all have to do
with seat belts. No. 207 is "Anchorage of
Seats-Passengers cars"; 208 is "Seat Belt
Installations-Passenger

Cars"; 209 is "Seat

Belt Assemblies-Passengers Cars, Multipurpose Passenger Vehicles, Trucks and Buses";
and 210 is "Seat Belt Assembly AnchoragesPassenger Cars." If you look at this, read it
and use your imagination and know a little of
what is going on, you will find there are not
29 resolutions there; I can hardly find 12.
Then you have wheel nuts, wheel dises and
hub caps; windshicld mounting; fuel tanks,
fuel tank filler pipes, and fuel tank connections, and so on.

These may be all right up to a certain
point, but I am certainly not satisfied with
this, and I do not think that anyone in the
Senate should be. We would like to know
about this in more detail because it is going
to be serious if it becomes law. We do not
know what is going to happen.

There is much talk about rear-window
defrosters. They say we should have electric
devices in windows, heater plates, and so on.
There is a very simple way to deal with frost
on car windows. You have the car heating
systern which requires air circulation just the
same as in your home. A heating system without circulation does not operate. If you are
driving along and you find your windows getting ice-covered, all you have to do is to open
a rear window slightly, about the depth of

your finger, and in ten minutes the frost will
[Hon. Mr. Fournier

(Madawaska-Restigouche).]

March 17, 197D

have disappeared from the side and rear windows, because then you have heat circulation
from the front of your car to the rear which
assists in defrosting the windows. There is no
problem there. We do not have to spend a lot
of money trying to get suitable defrosters. If
you have snow on the windows of your car,
you know there are some regulations. You
take a little whiskbroom, get out of your car
and brush the snow off and clean off the ice.
Any sane driver will do that.
I also feel sorry that in many provinces,
including my own province, we are relaxing
on driver education. Apparently, governments
are reluctant to spend more money on education, but I believe that if there is a place
where money is well spent it is on driver
education, because it does not matter what
kind of training you are going to take, what
kind of education you have, the first thing
you are going to do as soon as you start
working is to drive a car, and if there is no
one to train you how to drive correctly then
you become a menace to the public and may
end up a fatality.
I know that in New Brunswick not so long
ago we were graduating a large number of
driving instructors under the New Brunswick
Safety Council. Things were going well in
Quebec, Ontario and Nova Scotia, and, in
fact, right across the country, but all of a
sudden there was a relaxation in driver
training.
We have done away with two-ply tyres,
and that is a good thing because they were a
menace to the public. This is another case
where we become drowsy because of poor
advertising, and the advertising people put up
nice stories about the flexibility of the tires,
but they wcre not worth a-I will not use the
word here.
There is another problem here which is not
mentioned and I wouid like to hear someone
talking about this, the problem of tail-lights. I
arn not thinking about the expense. I understand that when the first cars were built they
put a little red bulb or kerosene light on the
back as a warning.
Thon came the tail-light, and we have
adopted the red. Today we have three lights
showing to the rear: the tail-light, the spotlight and the directional signal. We have red,
pale red and bright red. Across Canada the
railways are using green to move vehicles.
I think it was three years ago I was able to
interest the National Safety Council of
Ottawa in making a study of these tail-lights.
I felt that a moving car should show a green

March 17, 1870

SENATE DEBATES

tail-light and a parked car a red tail-light. If
you apply the brakes you have a red tail-light
which is a warning that you are going to stop.
Then you could use brighter red or amber for
the directional signal. We know that a
number of people are colour blind, and there
seems to be a lot of nonsense as to why we
are stuck with three reds, and we are trying
to differentiate between dull and bright red,
when we have other colours accepted by
other safety codes.
You will be surprised to learn of the effort
made by the National Safety Council in
trying to arrive at an answer, but they have
not arrived at one yet. They have about half
a ton of briefs presented to them by all kinds
of people, people who supply the glass, and so
on, and so-called experts, and many have
written books for or against it.
However, I return to discussing the simplicity of the whole thing. The railways have
used green for moving vehicles, and why not
use green for tail-lights when a vehicle is
moving? This is a simple matter. It is really a
matter of changing one or two wires underneath and you have it. The politicians say it
would cost a fortune. It would not. You have
to amend only one word in the act. Then new
cars in the 1970s would be equipped with
green tail-lights, and within five years practically every car would be equipped with them.
This is not mentioned here. I am inclined to
believe that whoever drafted this was not in
very deep as far as safety and the knowledge
of cars is concerned.
Then there is the breathalizer system. I am
glad to see it is accepted as federal law. It is
accepted as a necessity all across the country.
I know that the legal boys have made a lot of
noise about its trying to infringe on your
rights, but when you think about it the rights
left to the layman today are not so many; you
are surrounded by laws. I think it is a good
move, and we know in England it has
decreased the number of accidents by a great
number. It is very effective in my province.
Anyone who refuses to take the breathalizer
test, to my mind, has had one or two drinks
too many. It is just as simple as that.
Another thing that is not mentioned is the
speedometer being set back. I feel the speedometer in cars should be sealed because this
is the worst possible racket. You bring your
car to a garage with so many thousand miles
on it and you find when you go back the next
week that your car has only, say, 28,000 miles
on it, and someone buys it thinking that it
has only that mileage on it. I know because I
have set back many of these myself.

Some people have mentioned roll bars,
improper ashtrays and door handles. I call
this baloney as far as highway safety is
concerned.
Now, the steering wheel. They are spending
a lot of money to come up with a flexible
steering wheel. I go along with that up t a
certain point, because if you have some kind
of shock absorber on your steering you are
likely to save lives. On the other hand, let us
not overlook the point that for every driver
killed behind a driving wheel there are four
passengers in the car killed. This is because
there is nothing for them to hold onto. So, the
steering wheel, if you are in a crash, is not
as bad as might be thought, although it is an
obstruction.
I have mentioned headrests, and I have
mentioned pollution and the reduction of the
compression of engines so that they are able
to utilize regular gas. I should like to mention
also the installation of crossbars on motorcycles. I remember that when I was in the
legislature the attorney general of our province was a good old man who drove about
2,000 mile a year, which was mostly done
with his wife on nice afternoons while travelling to his home town. Yet, he was in
charge of safety of motor vehicles. Every year
his department would come out with some
new safety regulations, and I was always in
hot water. He was of the view that motorcycles should carry only one light. I put up
quite an argument, and I finally won my
point with the help of a few civil servants. He
was not an easy man to handle.
The reason why I wanted two spotlights on
the cross bar of motorcycles was to make
identification of them simple. When you are
driving at night and see only one light, for a
few moments you do not know whether it is a
motorcycle, a truck or a car with one light
missing. If motorcycles are compelled to have
two spotlights on the crossbar, then an
approaching motorist sees three lights-a
headlight and two sidelights-and he knows
immediately he is meeting a motorcycle.
New Brunswick also introduced not too
long ago the safety triangle. If you are
stopped on the road because of a flat tire
you have to place a red reflective safety
triangle 200 feet behind your car. This regulation was passed about three years ago, and I
had quite a bit to do in promoting it through
a television program. However, during all the
time since then while travelling through the
province I have seen only one car with the
safety triangle displayed.

SENATE DEBATES
At one time I was told of a man on the
Mackay highway around Saint John who had
a flat tire. He had no spare. He put out his
safety triangle, and took off the wheel, leaned
it against the car, and went to a garage to get
some help. When he returned he found that
somebody had stolen the tire and the triangle.
I was sorry to hear of this happening in New
Brunswick, almost on Senator McElman's
doorstep.
This leads me to mention the need to standardize bumpers. The so-called bumper on the
cars today is not a bumper at all. It is merely
an ornament. Some cars have bumpers that
are recessed away into the cowling at the
front.
Years ago cars had bumpers that were
bumpers. If you hit a pole in such a car, you
might dent the frame or even break the pole,
but you did no great damage to the car. That
bumper extended 12 or 14 inches in front of
the car. I will admit that it did not look so
good, but it performed the function that it
was intended to perform.
It is my opinion that we have to get back to
having real bumpers of a standardized design
and height installed on all cars. The present
day bumpers are nothing more than ornaments, and do not really protect the most
expensive part of the car, the grill, which is
made in one piece and of the cheapest material. Some grills are so frail that you have to be
careful when you take them out of the crate
in which they are packed. The radiator is
placed behind that grill, and is fastened to the
fenders, instead of being tied to two rods
extending from the cowling. You need only
hit something quite gently to move the
bumper back, which moves the fender back,
which moves the radiator back, and there is a
chain reaction all the way along the car. It
does not take much of a bump on the front
end of a car to cause damage that will cost
$500 to repair. This is why our insurance
rates are so high.
I hope that we shall soon see a standard
bumper on the Pontiacs, Dodges, Chryslers,
and other makes of automobile. It is most
important, I think, that something be done in
respect of bumpers.
Honourable senators, it is getting late, so I
will conclude my remarks. Let us remember
that a car by itself does not cause an accident. I have yet to hear of a car without a
driver causing an accident. This is impossible,
unless the car has been improperly parked on
a hill and the brakes give way. Yet, here we
are scratching our heads and making regulations to improve the car while not thinking
[Hon. Mr. Fournier (Madawaska-Restigouche).]

March 17, 1970

about the driver. The driver is the weakness.
I could speak for a whole hour on the driver
alone, because it is here that great improvements can be made. I am sorry to hear that
we are doing away with the education of
drivers.
We have drivers on our highways today
who are close to the end of their lives. They
should be removed. We should make it easy
for police patrols to remove careless drivers
from the highway. It is almost impossible to
remove them today, unless they kill somebody, or themselves.
Let us remember that when we get into a
car, close the door, turn the key, and proceed
on our way, we have only four places to go.
We can go to our destination, wherever it is;
we can land in jail, and this happens to many
drivers; we can land in hospital, and this also
happens to many drivers; or we can land in
the morgue. There are only those four places,
and we have to exercise all possible care in
order to arrive at our destination.
We must also remember our tendency to
blame the other driver. The fault is never our
own; it is always that of the other driver. We
never realize how fast we are travelling until
we have to make a sudden stop and, honourable senators, this is where I stop.
Motion agreed to, and bill read second time.

On motion of Hon. Mr. Petten, bill referred to the Standing Senate Committee on

CAPE BRETON DEVELOPMENT
CORPORATION ACT
BILL

TO

AMEND-SECOND

READING

Hon. Earl W. Urquhari moved the second
reading of Bill C-138, to amend the Cape
Breton Development Corporation Act.
He said: Honourable senators, Bill C-138 is
brief, simple and non-controversial, and I
shall restrict my remarks to its principle. It is
to amend the Cape Breton Development Corporation Act.
The Cape Breton Development Corporation
was established in 1967 with the power to
make grants and loans to enterprises that
would make a substantial contribution to the
industrial development of Cape Breton. The
purpose of this amendment is to broaden the
powers of the Cape Breton Development Corporation and enable the corporation to guarantee loans, in addition to making grants
and loans, from normal commercial sources.

March 17, 1970

Marc 17.1970SENATE
DEBATES

At the present Urne guaranteed loans could
be made by the Department of Regional Economic Expansion by simply designating an
area as a "speciai area" ini consultation with
the province concerned, but it is feit by the
Governrnent that this power of guaranteeing
loans should be given to the Cape Breton
Development Corporation so as to prevent a
duplication of this service by the department
and DEVCO.
The Cape Breton Development Corporation
already possesses ail of the other powers that
the Departmnent of Regional Economic Expansion has to assist industrial development, and
a goverrnent guarantee may enable an enterprise in a special area to borrow at a reasonable rate of interest in circumstances where it
would not otherwise be able to find a bank or
investmnent company willing to lend.
Accordingly, honourable senators, this bill
would give the Cape Breton Development
Corporation the right to guarantee loans Up to
$100 million with the approval of the Governor in Council on the reconinendation of the
Ministers of Regional Economic Expansion
and Finance, and to guarantee the payment of
interest on such loans. This means that the
corporation will have on hand, for qulck
action, this power to help any industry wishing to settle or expand in Cape Breton
where a guaranteed boan appears to be the
right type of assistance to meet the situation.
I should point out that this amendment
deals with only one aspect of the work done
by DEVCO. This amendment does flot change
i any way the functions of the corporation
with regard to coal mining operations on
Cape Breton Island. This amendxnent deals
only with the corporation's activities for the
development of industries other than coal
raining. This bill, therefore, is extremely
ïmportant because it will round out the
powers of the corporation whlch. wiII then
have ail the means required to promote
industrial development i Cape Breton.

21498-47

That, honourable senators, is the principle
o! the bill.
Hon. John M. Macdonald: I rise for the
purpose of saying I whoily agree with everything which has been said by the honourable
Senator Urquhart. He gave a very good and
concise explanation of what the bill mneans. I
will only add that I think it is a measure
which is worthy and deserving o! the support
of ail honourable senators.
Senator Urquhart made no mention of
whether or not he wished this bill to go to
committee. Personaily, I do not think it would
serve any useful purpose at this time to send
it to a committee. When the bull was before
the House of Commons it was referred to
their Standing Committee on Regional Development on February 25. At that time it was
pointed out that the present chairman of the
Cape Breton Development Corporation had
only recently been appointed and was then
engaged in compiling a financial statenient
for the year. Therefore, it was felt that it
would be preferable to have him appear at a
later date to be asked detalled questions
regarding the operations o! the corporation.
The Commons coninittee did not ask hlm for
any details of the operation. I agree and consider this to be a good idea.
I belleve that the bill should be given third
reading tonight.
Motion agreed to and bill read second time.

The amendment before us provides that:

In other words, it provides that the minister
may appoint either a member of the House of

Hon. Mr. Flynn: Both.
Hon. Mr. Robichaud: Clause 19 of the bill,
with the side note "Centre charitable organization", says:

that will come to us from the other place, and
adjourn for the Easter recess following a
Royal Assent to bills, probably late in the
afternoon on Wednesday, March 25.
When we return on Monday night, we
should have before us Bill C-194, the Statute
Law (Supplementary Retirement Benefits)
Amendment Act, 1970. This is an important
bill and one that will require careful consideration, both in this chamber and in the other
place. I think it would be the desire of members of both houses to try to have this measure enacted before we adjourn for the Easter
recess. In addition, Senator Leonard will present the report from the National Finance
Committee on Supplementary Estimates (B)
for the financial year ending March 31, 1970.
It is desirable to have this report debated and
adopted before the supply bill covering the
supplementary Estimates comes before us.
Before adjournrnent, we will have to deal
with two supply bills-one covering Supplementary Estimates (B) and the other granting
interin supply for a part of the 1970-71 fiscal
year.
Also, the debate will continue on the
motion that the Senate Committee on Legal
and Constitutional Affairs be instructed to
consider and report on procedures for the
review by the Senate of statutory instruments.
Before the adjournment for Easter we may
receive a message from the other house
asking this house to join in the establishment
of a special committee on price stability.
Whether or not it is received will depend on
the progress made in the other place.
I thought it desirable to give honourable
senators this indication of the work we may

March 19, 1970

Marc 19,1970SENATE
DEBATES

I think at titis Uie it is appropriate to note
some of the observations made yesterday by
the Prime Minister of Canada. If I do not
refer to the observations made by others it is
because I single him. out as head of the Goverument and because his are the only
remarks I was able to acquire at this stage.
With your permission, I will quote in part
from what the Prime Minister said:
It is a great pleasure to be here ta
associate myseif with you i honouring
these men who have honoured their
country, who have honoured their f amilies by serving the nation so well. The
way li which they served by working ini
an Upper Chamber, and bi-camerai
systemn has, of course, very deep roots in
the past. Civilized nations for many,
many centuries realized the importance of having two chambers to study
the very vital and important questions
which concerned their nation.
I do not have to tell titis gathering that
the councils of the ancient Greeks and
the Senate of Rome establlshed these traditions very strongly.
The ancient
German councils did it li a sightly different way, but they too belleved in the
virtue of discussing twice every subjeet
of importance ta the nation.
[Translation]
Our traditions here are samewhat diuferent. The parliamentary systemn has
reverted to the role of the Senate as
a Chamber where members apply
their wisdom, their devotion and their
knowledge to an exhaustive review of
decisions which are also considered li
another Chamber. Speaking for myseif, I
should say simply that I have every
respect for this institution and thatI
hope it will remain firmnly established in
our parliamentary traditions.
[Englishj
I repeat, I believe that this bi-cameral
systemn is a very important part of Parliament, especially in a federal formn of government and I am sure it will continue
for many years to perform its very vital
functions.
Then he concluded:
I want to thank the families and friends;
of former Government Leaders who are
here tonight. I want especialiy to express
my appreciation and thanks to the f amilies of Senator Aseltine and Senator Connolly, two senators who are still with us
and stili very active in the Senate today.

Honourable senators, I think I can say to
His Honour, who presided over the moving
ceremony yesterday, that it wrnl serve to
cause each of us to be dedicated to the work
which we have been called upon to perforni
in this chamber.
I express our thanks to His Honour, to the
honourable Senator Bourget and to ail who
were in any way associated with yesterday's
ceremony.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
[Translation]
Hon. Jacques Flynn: Honourable senators, I
say that I share the feelings expressed by the
Government Leader with respect to yourself,
Mr. Speaker, and with respect to our former
Speaker, Senator Bourget, for suggesting and
bringing about yesterday's ceremony in recognition of services rendered to the country by
those who have shauldered the responsîbilities
of Government Leader in the Senate.
I fuiiy agree that this idea deserved ta be
carried out because far too few people realize
the services rendered here, flot only by the
Senate, but also by those whose exacting duty
it is ta direct our work and represent the
Government in this house.
[English]
Honourable senators, I have said that I
share the views of the Leader of the Government with respect to this great idea and the
implementation thereof, that is, of recognizlng
the services rendered ta this country by the
former Leaders of the Government lin the
Senate.
I would also suggest that the next time we
add ta the collection in this corridor-I do not
personaily suggest that this should be soon,
because the hanourable Leader of the Government knows very well that I think he is
daing a fine job in bis present position, but
time moves on and the public's love for politicians has been known ta sour-that the picture that wiil appear there will be of one who
would have preferred to be included among
those hung in the hall on the other side. In
any event, I for one represent the hopefuls,
but I doubt very much that my portrait will
be hung there, sa the present Leader of the
Governiment should console himelf with titis
fact.
Hon. Mr. Martin: I think you are too
pessimistic.
Hon. Mr. Lamontagne: He is a realist!

SENATE DEBATES
Hon. Mr. Flynn: I am not thinking of the
results of the election, but of the judgment of
the next Prime Minister of Canada!
I am happy that the Leader of the Government has mentioned the comments made by
the Prime Minister yesterday on the Senate.
The Prime Minister used the occasion to
dispel the rumour that he shares the opinion
of the socialists in respect of the Senate.
Hon. Mr. Martin: Not at all.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: There was a rumour to
that effect, and the fact that the Prime Minister came out so clearly in favour of the
Senate and the role it is playing is, I think,
very good not only for the Senate but for
Canada as a whole.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: He was supported on this
point by the Leader of the Opposition in the
other place. So, I think the reform of the
Senate will be directed toward improving
public opinion of this chamber, as well as an
appreciation of the work of the Upper House.
I would emphasize that it is of paramount
importance that the public generally recognize and appreciate the value of the work
done by the Senate. As has been mentioned
by the Leader of the Government on several
occasions, when you tell Canadians precisely
what we are doing here, they are usually
very surprised and equally appreciative, for
they realize that our labour is of significant
worth.
Therefore, in this respect the ceremony of
yesterday was excellent, one which has rendered a real service to the public as well as to
the Senate.

Raoul Dandurand. I think it is not invidious
to say that of the great leaders we have had
in the past-and I am sincere in excluding
myself from that group-there was none who
exceeded the eminence and capacity of these
two men.
I think we owe a great debt of gratitude to
Senator Bourget for having conceived this
idea, and to Mr. Speaker who, with his staff,
spared no effort to make the appropriate
arrangements for this significant ceremony.
I hope that one day some young man might
take inspiration from what is displayed there
and make a career for himself in these halls.
If only one has the fire lighted under him as a
result of seeing the portraits of these men,
and perhaps of knowing what they did, then
everything that they did will have been
justified.
I would like to see a biographical booklet of
the careers of the former leaders published as
they were played out here in the Senate
chamber. It would be a fine addition to
Canadiana.
On behalf of Senator Aseltine and all those
above me, I do say thank you to Mr. Speaker
and to the leaders here, and to the Speaker
and leaders in the other place, for their
participation.
I can only add, and without being obnoxious, that I hope before long the Leader of the
Government and the Leader of the Opposition
will join the group in the corridor outside.

review by the Senate of instruments made in
virtue of any statute of the Parliament of
Canada. and ta consider in connection therewith any public documents relevant thereto.
Han. Allister Grosart: Hanaurable senators,
1 find myseif in the rather unusual position of
speaking in the Senate with anly one item on
the Order Paper, and that standing in my
name. I hasten to say that this is not the kind
of arrangement I consider the best possible
for the Senate in any circunistances. I do not
wish ta impute motives, but when I find such
a large assemblage of senators present on this
afternoon with only one item on the Order
Paper, and that standing ini my name, I hope
that it is not a case of mass retaliation.
The matter that is now before us was ably
presented by the Leader of the Government,
and thoroughly discussed by other honourable
senatars. My first comment about it is that it
is extraordinary, in one sense, that it has
taken this long for the Parliament of Canada
ta get around ta this vital subject of curtailing the delegation. of legislation in Canada
which has now reached a paint where it is
incomparable with that of any nation with a
system of government similar ta ours.
The evidence of that is abundant. Some of
it appears in the reports of the other place.
One naturaily wonders how we gat into the
position where we are delegating authority,
and failing to scrutinize the administration of
that delegation, i a way that no other comparable nation in the world would countenance.
The Leader of the Government quoted
some comments of Prof essor John Kersel
who is the author of the leading Canadian
text in tis field, ParliamentarvSupervision of
Delegated Legistation. In his evidence before
the special committee of the other place on
statutory instruments, Professor Kerseil said
on a good many occasions that this is an
extraordinarily Canadian constitutional phenamenon. At page 78 of the repart of the
praceedings of that cammittee, he said:
Nowhere did I find, exoept In the war
years in Australia, the unlimited scope of
delegating clauses of bills and sections of
acta. 1 found no explanation for this
almost unlimited delegatian in the
Canadian context.
21498-48

Later an, he said:
The sharpest contrast, I think, is with
Britain where they have a bigbly developed welfare state and no federal
system. It is a system in which there
wouid be many more excuses for braad
delegatians, and yet you do not find
themn. There is much more precisian.
Another not quite comparable system
where there are very few broad delegatians, and you wrnl have a witness who
can tell you more about this in detail, is
the American. Their Congress is most
jealous of its legislative authority and
simply refuses ta delegate in an unlimited fashion ... As I mentioned previausly, this broad delegating pattern is quite
unusual at least in other Commonwealth
systems and, as far as I knaw, it would
be considered quite exceptional. in the
American instance, taa.
That is really a surnmary of a good deal of
the evidence that is available in the texts an
the subject.
Some of us wha are members of other cammîittees of the Senate which have been examining legisiatian should nat be surprised that
this situation has came about. I can only say
that my own observation has been that it is
yet another example of what happens often
enough in aur personal lives. We develop a
small bad habit and get away with it, and
that small bad habit eventually becomes a big
bad habit. In the repart which this chamber
will receive shortiy fram another cammittee I
imagine there wiil be a rather extraordinary
current example of tris very thing.
The question, of course, naw goes ta aur
own Standing Senate Comniittee on Legal
and Constitutianal Affairs as ta what recammendation might be appropriate fram the
Senate of Canada in respanse, perhaps, ta the
report of the camxnittee of the ather place. I
wauld hope that the committee will nat take
the specific terms of reference toa seriously.
The direction that the committee is ta report
fram "'time ta time" seems ta me ta be rather
limiting, and might be taken as indîcating
that it should be that cammittee that would
in future deal with the subject of delegated
legislation in sa far as the Senate of Canada
is concerned. Persanally, I hope trat would
nat be the conclusion the commitee would
reach.
I say that mainly for the reason that ail the
evidence 1 have been able ta gather indicates
that tris kind of scrutiny of delegated legislatian is largely a matter for expert public

SENATE DEBATES
servants. It is not the kind of thing that is
best done in the ordinary processes of parliamentary committee meetings. That is why I
hope the committee will not assume it is the
committee to undertake this task. However, I
do think the work should be undertaken by a
special committee of the Senate which would
have the necessary professional assistance,
because it has been the experience of other
countries that this is not a matter which takes
up a great deal of the time of any one comnmittee. Experience indicates that the work is
usually done by expert public servants who
examine carefully delegated legislation and
its authority, and then report cases that seem
to them to require further scrutiny to the
committee itself.
There is, perhaps, a parallel here in the
operation of our former divorce committee
which operated in its latter days in much the
fashion I am suggesting. We had a commissioner who did the normal day-to-day processing work, and who referred his decisions
to the committee for approval.
The terms of reference, and some of the
remarks that were made in this connection
both here and in the other place, seem to
indicate that the work of the committee
should be limited to an examination of the
regulations themselves. There is a good deal
of discussion in the literature on the subject
as to whether the government policy behind
the regulations should be examined by such a
committee. There is a case, of course, to be
made for the statement that the broad policy
of government should be subject largely to
examination in Parliament rather than in a
special committee of this kind. However, I
would suggest to honourable senators that it
would be absolutely necessary in any examination of delegated legislation to look behind
the delegation. My brief experience in this
field indicates that most of the trouble arises
because of the terms of reference. By and
large it is caused by too broad a delegation.
We have had in Canada a slow development,
again a small bad habit developing into a big
one. My examination of the statutes reveals
that the delegation, that is the authority to
make regulations under an act, was formerly
worded in such phraseology as this: "the
Governor in Council shall have the authority
to make regulations necessary to the
implementation of the provisions of this act."
I would have no objection to that type of
delegation where there is the limitation of the
word "necessary". The requirement here
would be that any regulation made be subject
[Hon. Mr. Grosart.]

March 19, 1970

to proof in court or elsewhere that it was
necessary to implement the provisions of the
act.
The wording we now have most frequently
is quite different. One broad type of reference
usually gocs in this manner: "The Governor in
Council, on the advice of the minister, shall
have the authority to make regulations which
he deems necessary to implement the provisions of the act." There are worse phrases
than that. I suggest to honourable senators
that our committee should concern itself with
whether this type of delegation is not the
reason why we in Canada are in this unfortunate and regrettable position of having delegated authority so much more than other
comparable jurisdictions. What sense does
it make for an act of Parliament to
say that the minister or the Governor General
on the advice of the minister may make any
regulation that be deems necessary? Perhaps
my learned legal friends will tell me if the effect of this is not to take any question of
validity under the act or regulations out of
the courts altogether. I have not been able to
find a case, perhaps there have not been any,
but I would imagine that someone feeling
himself and his interests affected adversely
by a regulation might seek redress in the
courts. If he sought redress I would think it
would be on the grounds that the exercise of
the power under the regulations was beyond
the authority given by Parliament, that is,
beyond the provisions of the act. Yet it seems
to me that in this particular case the officials
would say, "All right, go to court. When you
go you will find we have the authority under
this act to make any regulation that the minister happens to think is necessary to make
the act work."
I suggest, therefore, that for this committee
merely to examine the regulations and their
administration as they stand will not get us
very far. I suggest that the committee will
have to go a way beyond this and think of
the philosophy and psychology behind this
kind of development. It is not unusual; we
have examples of it over and over again. How
does it happen? There is a fairly simple
explanation. Public servants who draft these
acts and, of course, have a great deal to do
with the wording, are naturally concerned
that they will have all the power they
need to make the act work. I can understand
that. On the other hand, those same officiais
will normally not have the same degree of
concern for the public interest in the operation of the act that we would certainly expect
Parliament to have.

March 19, 1970

SENATE DEBATES

We hear the word bureaucrat used in a
derogatory sense, although it is not necessarily so in its own meaning. It is this practice
that so often brings abuse on officials. They
have this authority and they are going to
exercise it. Sometimes, of course, the answer
is given that al regulations are subject to
scrutiny by Parliament or by the courts. I
have indicated one of the cases in which that
right of scrutiny might be removed from the
courts. It is very seldom under ordinary circumstances taken away from Parliament. The
Leader of the Government has pointed out
that generally speaking under our present
laws most of these regulations are tabled.
There are some reservations, usually on
grounds of national security or very special
reasons, but even in these cases the fact of
the non-disclosure is required to be reported
to Parliament. Is there really the scrutiny of
regulations by Parliament that is normally
given to legislation in the ordinary sense?
The answer is no, and, interestingly enough,
in a document which is before this Senate at
the moment, the supplementary Estimates,
there are two rather interesting examples of
the kind of abuse that this too free granting
of power to ministers and the Governor in
Council develops.
On page 8 of the supplementary Estimates,
which I believe I am in order in using as an
illustration at this time, there is a vote in
connection with the operation of the Canadian Wheat Board. It is given certain power,
notwithstanding the Canadian Wheat Board
Act, but no power to make regulations. When
the officials were before us they said, "we find
it will not work this way; we are going to
bring in some amendments to give us power
to make regulations so that we can make this
change in the act work." Senator Phillips
(Rigaud) drew this to the attention of the
committee this morning. Here is the extraordinary position of the law of Canada being
amended by an appropriation act "notwithstanding" the general provisions of the act.
That is not enough. Not only are they amending the act in this rather undercover way, but
they now must seek authority to make regulations under this amendment to the act. This
act of Parliament is being amended-not in
this case by a $1 vote-but still by an appropriation vote. In addition they also have to
seek the regulatory power even to make this
work.

Hon. Mr. Grosari: I am quite sure that
Senator Phillips (Rigaud) is a friend of every
Canadian.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Grosar±: Certainly he has the
respect of all those that I know.
Hon. Mr. Martin: Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. Grosart: In raising this matter,
Senator Phillips (Rigaud) was in no way
attempting to curtail the interests of Canadian farmers in respect of Durum wheat. I
rather doubt if he knows Durum wheat from
any other kind of wheat. I certainly do not.
However, we had honourable senators there
who might have informed him and myself
had this question arisen. That was not the
point raised in the committee. The important
point at issue was whether we are to keep on
with this fiction of legislating by appropriations and by regulations under appropriations. If this question arose next week or the
week after, I am sure there is not a lawyer in
Canada who, with respect to regulations
under the Canadian Wheat Board Act, would
be able to advise his client that there are new
regulations under an amendment to the act in
an appropriation act. This is only one of the
spin-offs. It is not the worst, but it is one
about which the members of the legal profession are, I am sure, concerned.
Another example was brought to the attention of the committee by Senator Everett.
Again, in case the Leader of the Government
is about to intervene, I would say I am quite
sure that Senator Everett has the interests of
the farmers of Western Canada at heart too.
He was not dealing with that aspect of the
matter. The vote on page 20 refers to loans,
investrnents and advances, and Senator Everett pointed out that here again by the backdoor method of an appropriation act a new
crown company is being created. Without
informing the public, without debating it in
Parliament, we are forming a new crown
company, and by this footnote, the fine print,
in an appropriation act, we are giving power
to the minister in effect to deal with very
substantial sums of money "under such terms
and conditions as the Governor in Council
may prescribe."
Here is another case of a small bad habit
growing and growing over the years, till we
have this absurd situation of a crown corporaHon. Mr. Martin: I always thought Senator tion created in an appropriation act and given

SENATE DEBATES

that this is a glaring current example of the
great danger of the continued proliferation of
this unusual Canadian phenomenon of too free
delegation of powers.
I would further suggest, although this point
was covered in part by the Leader of the
Government in his opening remarks, that it
will be necessary to do much more than look
at regulations or other instruments that might
have similar names.
In looking through some of the recent acts,
the 1968 and 1969 statutes, I find all sorts of
devices are used to grant extraordinary
powers, very few of which will ever come
under the scrutiny of Parliament. One example is a council, a committee, or a board of
directors who are given unlimited powers to
draw up and legislate their own by-laws as
they deem necessary for the purposes of the
act. This is a delegation of a delegation of
power. This kind of delegated legislative
power is never tabled in the house. The bylaws of any such corporation are not required
by law to be tabled, because there is a precise
legal definition of "regulations" which come
under the governing statute.
Hon. Mr. Smith: I wonder if the honourable
senator would give us a concrete example of
what he has just been talking about. It is a
new idea.
Hon. Mr. Grosari: Of delegation?
Hon. Mr. Smith: The council or board of
directors. Does the honourable senator have a
definite example of that?
Hon. Mr. Grosari: If the honourable senator
will bear with me I might find one.
Hon. Mr. Choquette: Make one up.
Hon. Mr. Smith: I would not know the
difference.
Hon. Mr. Grosari: I can tell the honourable
senator that it is far from unusual. As a
matter of fact, without looking at the acts I
can give him some examples. The Board of
Governors of the C.B.C. is a very good example. Another in its former status would be the
Board of Management of Polymer Corporation.
Hon. Mr. Smith: I suppose the point is that
all these things refer to crown corporations.
Hon. Mr. Grosart: They are not all crown
corporations. Sometimes they are boards or
councils set up under, say, a co-operative marketing act, and it is not itself a crown corpo[Hon. Mr. Grosart.]

March 19, 1970

ration. The same thing occurs, of course, in
some bills incorporating private companies.
The other day we had one concerning the
National Farmers Union where the board of
directors was given this same kind of power
to do anything they deemed necessary for the
purposes of the union. Senator Macdonald
(Cape Breton) has just handed me a copy of
this act to incorporate the National Farmers
Union, wherein the board of the union-may
from time to time, make such
by-laws, rules and regulations, not contrary to law, as it deems necessary or
advisable for the due carrying out of the
purposes and objects of the Union.
I might say that almost the same wording
appears in bills setting up boards and councils, et cetera, and have been given this
almost complete unlimited authority.
There are many other aspects of this legislation. I would certainly commend to honourable senators a careful reading of the House
of Commons report, in particular the evidence, because some eminent authorities in
this field did come before the committee in
the other place. If I may just conclude with
one more quotation, this time from Professor
Mallory, head of the Economics and Political
Science Department of McGill University, on
the very matter which is the heart of the lack
of scrutiny that is so often the result of
excessive
delegation of legislation. He
describes the situation in these words:
The department makes an order and it is
communicated to the people who are
affected by it. The department of Transport makes an order that affects the air
lines, but nobody ever publicly discusses
it in the way that a bill gets discussed
before a parliamentary committee, so
affected people can argue against it and
the full weight of public information and
public opinion be brought to bear. This is
why parliamentary scrutiny of both form
and policy provides a chance to focus,
within the limited resources of Parliament, on a public issue without the full
dress procedure of having to debate the
bill every time.
I conclude by saying we can apply that to
what would seem to me to be the most useful
way for the Parliament of Canada to provide
for the continuing and detailed scrutiny of
delegated legislation, and that is to establish
within the Senate a special committee with
the necessary professional assistance.

March 19, 1970

SENATE DEBATES

Hon. Mr. Gratian O'Leary: Honourable
senators, if no one on the other side wishes to
speak, I would like to say just a few words.
Someone once wrote that the difference
between John Bright and Mr. Gladstone was
that while Gladstone explored every inlet,
Bright was content to sail from headland to
headland. I am sure my friend Senator Grosart would be embarrassed if I likened him to
Mr. Gladstone, and I certainly am not John
Bright, but I would like to add a few general
observations to the excellent speech we have
just heard from Senator Grosart, who, with
his zeal and industry, is able to do things
which I would not attempt to do in this house.
I have been in Ottawa watching Government from a ringside seat for some 60 years
under Prime Ministers from Sir Wilfrid
Laurier to Mr. Trudeau. One of the things
which has impressed me most and sometimes
frightened me is the growth of the power of
bureaucracy. Many books have been written
and many speeches made about the growing
power of the Prime Minister and that, I think,
deserves the attention and thought of us all.
But, much more has been written about the
growing power of the executive when, in
actual fact, the real power, the meaningful
power, the dangerous power, has been in the
growth of the bureaucracy. It has been the
genius of British free parliamentary government that there must be countervailing forces
to all agencies of power in the state. Thus you
have in our judicial system the prosecution
and the defence. You have in Parliament the
ministerial power and the countervailing
force of an opposition, one which we maintain
as a structure of our parliamentary system,
and we actually pay the Opposition Leader to
examine and to oppose. But there has been no
countervailing force in the matter of the
power of the bureaucracy. Parliaments come
and go, ministries rise and fall, but the
bureaucracy goes on, goes on in increasing
power and with less and less check upon that
power.
We often hear and speak in this house
about the role and the function of the Senate.
Fifty years ago a great public man in this
country, Sir Clifford Sifton, said that the real
role of the Senate in days ahead would be to
protect not only Parliament but the executive
and the Government itself from the growing
p'ower of the bureaucracy. I think this is true.
Let us take the example of a new minister in
a new ministry,' who goes into a department.
Humanly, he knows very little, perhaps nothing, about the operations, the functions or the
mechanism of that department. It is perhaps

too often true that the bureaucrats in that
department go to some pains to see that he
does not learn too fast. I know of cases where
this actually has happened.
I do not want to introduce partisanship into
this debate, but it is true that when the Diefenbaker Government came into office in 1958
there were bureaucrats in those departments
who identified their interests and their wishes
with the cause of the Government they had
been serving and who looked upon Conservatives as occupation troops, an evil that would
pass and which they would have to put up
with for the time being. It is true that in
many cases these people did try to thwart
and obstruct the work of the Government of
Mr. Diefenbaker, but I fear they would try to
obstruct and thwart the work of the members
of any government.
This question has been under consideration
in England for years. I am sure that all of you
on the opposite side will remember the book
written by Lord Hewart, a great jurist in
England, called The New Despotism in which
he pointed out and proved fairly strongly that
the Government of Great Britain was rapidly
passing from Parliament into the hands of the
bureaucracy.
Honourable senators, it is because I was
brought up to revere Parliament that I look
with suspicion upon the growing power of the
bureaucracy, a power exercised by people
who may be dedicated servants of the state
but who can be dangerously wrong.
I have not agreed entirely with some of my
party who think that Mr. Trudeau is hacking
at the foundations of Parliament by building
up a bureaucracy of his own. And he has. He
has some 22 or 23, perhaps more, perhaps 50,
very able young executives surrounding him.
I think what he has in mind-and I support
him in this-is to build up a bureaucracy of
his own to check the other bureaucrats. If
that is what he is doing, then I support him
with al my heart.
I have spoken in this house again and again
about orders in council. The housekeeping of
the Government of Canada, the administration from day to day, is carried on by orders
in council. We are supposed to take a sober
second look at Government acts and proposals. Do we take any second look, or any look
at all, at what the Government is doing by
orders in council? I know there are procedures by which any person may see an order
in council, but I am told there are some 2,500
passed each year. We do not know if those
orders in council conform to -the power given

750

SENATE DEBATES

them by the statutes. And we have found case
after case, notably in the Immigration Department, where persons have taken action which
affected the liberties and the rights of
individuals, by departing from the power
given them by the statutes. This is a grave
weakness in parliamentary government.
We read in the press every day that Parliament must get on with the business of the
country, Parliament must stop talking-and
yet that is what Parliament is about. Parliament is not a production line, to turn out law
after law after law. Parliament is a place
where you not only must pass good and considered laws but where you must prevent the
passage of bad laws.
That is why Parliament is so important. It
was created in the first place to check the
Queen's estimates, or the King's executives, if
you will. That is the primary function of
Parliament, to check the acts and the actions
and the proposals of the executive. When
Parliament is not doing that, when its members are not crying out for redress of grievances, when they are not crying out for the
rights of the individual, for the dignity and
worth of the individual, then Parliament is
not performing the task for which it was
created in the first place.
"More laws!" they say-"make Parliament
a production line; stop the question hour;
stop asking questions!" Honourable senators,
the best hour, the most potent, the most
useful hour in Parliament is, or should be, the
hour to ask questions. I wish there were more
questions asked in this house, because we
have a leader here now with a vast experience of Government, who sat in many cabinets. He knows their value and he knows
their difficulties. We should ask him and
question him and embarrass him if possible,
whenever we can, about whatever is going on
in Government.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: This is a problem. If we
wanted to do only that, this would be the
proper way; but, in the way the leader
answers he would take all the time of the
Senate.
Hon. Mr. O'Leary: There is something in
that. I myself asked a question today, and I
watched with admiration the way he
answered,-or did not answer-me.
My point is that Parliament, after all, does
not rule by itself. Parliament rules through
the people, and the people have a means of
holding Parliament to accountability. But
there is no way by which the people can hold
[Hon. Mr. O'Leary.]

March 19, 1970

the bureaucrats to accountability. This must
be done by Parliament itself. We have got to
find out what these young, able, dedicated men
are up to. Who knows today? Who knows the
author of the White Paper which is stirring
up so much controversy in Canada? No one
knows for sure.
How is the average minister to know
whether his able young bureaucratic advisor
is giving him the right advice? He does not
know. He has to accept that advice and digest
it as best he can, and bring it before his
cabinet colleagues and explain it as best he
can. This is why we need a countervailing
force to see to it that the bureaucrats are not
running away with the Government of
Canada.
This is not our system, that is not what we
intended when we kicked the Crown out of
our councils. We intended Parliament to rule,
and Parliament is not ruling.
My friend Senator Grosart mentioned
crown companies. We have a veritable
sprawling empire of crown corporations. Does
any member of this house actually believe
that the actions of these crown companies, the
day-to-day operations of these crown corporations, set up by our money and spending our
money, are the right actions?
It is true that their books are audited, but
who really looks at the operations of those
companies? Some of them have been good
and some of them have been bad, but I
submit to you that we do not know, we do
not supervise what is taking place in a crown
corporation, or whatever you call it, such as
the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation.
We do not know what the Film Board is
doing. It is all right to read that they won
prizes in Europe or America or somewhere
else. What are they doing for the education of
the youth of Canada? What are they doing in
our schools? This is the test of an organization such as the Film Board.
As for the C.B.C., I could speak to you for
hours and hours on end about the shortcomings of the C.B.C. Let me give you an example. A few minutes ago the leader told us
what the Prime Minister said last evening
about the Senate. I was delighted with what
he said, although I felt like asking him, "Why
don't you appoint more senators to the vacancies-now 15 of them?" But he did speak
glowingly and eloquently and with great
power of the place of the Senate in Canada.
Not one word of that speech was reported on
the C.B.C., which purports to give people

TRIBUTES
THE LATE HON. J. WESLEY STAMBAUGH

March 23, 1970

Edmonton. It may be said of him that he was
a man of loyalty, but of all his loyalties the
most deeply felt and the most consistently
served was that to the Liberal party. He was
incapable of distinguishing between what was
good for the Liberal party and what was good
for Canada, because during his long period of
service be made it his business as far as he
was able to see to it that what the Liberal
party stood for was what was good for
Canada.
Whether one agrees with a man in all his
beliefs-and I happen to agree with Senator
Stambaugh in all with which I knew him to
be associated-one must realize that loyalty to
one's country is something that perhaps we
do not sufficiently explain and sell today. It
does not matter to what party a man belongs
as long as he deeply believes in the goals be
attempts to achieve and the interests of the
people be hopes to serve.
Senator Stambaugh became President of
the Liberal Party in Alberta in 1945. The
party had been out of office in that province
from 1937, in a futile association with the
Conservative Party in an attempt to beat the
Social Credit Party. In 1945 the feeling was
that the Liberal Party should get back into
business and stand on its own two feet. As
president, Senator Stambaugh was given the
job of putting the party back into business.
Then, for good or ill, for my benefit or otherwise, I do not know, by 1947 be persuaded me
that I should seck the leadership of the now
to be rejuvenated party. I sought that leadership and succeeded in being elected. By 1955
we had moved from a position of having no
seats to having 15 Liberal seats, and three
others who were in the caucus and had been
elected with our support, who perhaps did not
help us as much as they could because they
sat as Independents of one kind or another.
Wes Stambaugh did not have the opportunity to receive the kind of education available to young people today. But he had been
taught to read, and from then on, with courage and initiative, he had the sense to educate
himself. He was a man who did not sleep
much. I spent a great deal of my time with
him. He could talk until two o'clock in the
morning on a political problem. Then he
would get you out of bed at 5.30 in the morning because be thought you had had enough
sleep and it was time to start discussing the
problems of the day. I do not think there was

Hon. J. Harper Prowse: Honourable senators, I rise to draw to the attention of this
house that last Friday evening the Honourable John Wesley Stambaugh, formerly a
member of this house, passed away at his
home in Victoria, British Columbia. I wish to
advise honourable senators that the funeral
will take place in Edmonton, Wednesday next
at 1 p.m.
Many of you will remember Senator Stambaugh because he was summoned to this
house on September 7, 1949 and resigned in
June 1965. He was the first senator to retire
under the provisions of the Retirement of
Members of the Senate Act, 14 Elizabeth II,
1965, chapter 4, which allowed members of
the Senate to retire at the age of 75.
Those of you who were here during those
particular years will recall that Senator
Stambaugh was one who took a leading part
in the passage of that measure because it was
his opinion that the people of Canada and the
interests of the Senate could best be served
by limiting the term of service of senators. I
make that statement merely to repeat what
his thinking was, and not in any way to
reflect upon those who have passed the age of
75 and who still sit as members of this bouse,
and who make great contributions to the welfare of the people of this country.
John Welsey Stambaugh was a very unusual Canadian. He was perhaps a stereotype of
the Canadian of the past. He was unusual
because of the fact that he was born in tbe
United States, and was brought here at an
early age. He came to western Canada in
1905 at the age of 17, and there began his
career. Over a long period of time be became
very successful as a farmer and businessman.
However, from his earliest arrival in this
country be was associated with the Liberal
party and the men who in the early days a question of importance to the people of
represented it in western Canada. These were Alberta or to the people of Canada that
such men as John Oliver, the Siftons and anyone could raise that be could not talk
later James A. MacKinnon from the City of about intelligibly. He was an avid reader. He

March 23, 1970

DEBATES
Marc 23,1970SENATE

also enjoyed discussing and talking to people,
because he liked people.
Senator Stambaugh was a great sportsman
and fisberman. I remember in tbe early fifties
being persuaded by hlm to go on a fishing
trip into the Rockies. Altbough he was 25
years aider than I, at the end of tbree days
we had a large catch of fish, and ail I needed
was a place to lay my weary bead wbile all
be was looking for was a solid block on wbich
to dlean the fish.
Senator Stambaugh was a tremendous man.
Above everytbing else be had wbat perbaps
can be described as tbe gif t of curiosity. He
was not only concerned about tbe country in
whîcb be lived, but was cunious about everyone be met and why tbey acted and tbought
as tbey dîd. Ahl of bis life be bad been asking
very penetrating questions.
Hle was sick for about six weeks before be
died from the flu. His family tells me that be
went downbiil ratber rapidly. But I would
guess from what I know of him tbat be would
meet death as be had lived with if e and tbat
bis primary concern would be what new
experiences would be waiting for hlm beyond
the grave.
Hon. Waller M. Aseltîne: I did not know
aur former cahleague, Senator Stambaugh,
palitically or otherwîse, pnior ta bis caming to
tbe Senate in 1949, but I found him to be a
very capable senator, particularly when I was
Leader of the Government in tbe Senate following 1958. I had met hlm previausly out in
the open spaces wbere I soon learned tbat be
was an enthusiastic and successful fisherman.
In fact, time and time again he would return
from the Gatineau hbis and areas nortb of
there with large catches of Northern Pike,
Small-Mouth Black Bass and Walleye. He was
not at ail selfisb, because he always gave
some of the fish ta those of us wbo bad not
been able to be in the country. I, for one,
appreciated bis generosity in this respect,
thaugh I usually had quite good success
myself.
After Senator Stambaugh resigned I was in
British Columbia on a salmon fishing excursion of my own. I found out where be was
residing, and my wif e and I, along with some
otber friends, called ta see him. We had beard
tbat be was nat very well. In fact, when we
saw hlm on that occasion he was suffering
severely from sciatica and was scarcely able
to mave. We had a good visit witb hlm and 1
understand that be recovered somewhat after
that.

Honourable senators, before Senator Stambaugh became a senator, be was a pioneer
farmer in the Province of Alberta. As has
been stated, be came to Canada from the
United States as a young man. Very few
people know that be was a pioneer, in that be
filed on an Alberta homestead, lived on it
and proved it up and obtained the titie to it.
I do flot know anything about bis political
career in Alberta, but I always found him a
reasonable man in the Senate, especially in
commîttees. He was faithful in attendance at
those committees of wbîch be was a member.
I arn sorry indeed that Senator Stambaugh
bas passed to tbe Great Beyond, and I bope
that many of us will write to bis dear wife
and send ber our condolences.
Hon. Lionel Choquette: Honourable senators, it bas been tbe custom in titis chamber,
and a good one, to pay tribute to senators
wbo bave passed away, altbough tbey were
no longer active in tbis Senate.
During the few years I bad tbe pleasure of
knowing Senator Stambaugb, I found him to
be a good-living citizen and, unlilce wbat we
bave heard tbis evening, I always found him
above pettiness and above politics.
In 1961, 1 was a member of the Interparliamentary Group which went to Brussels. Senator Stambaugb was my closest travelling comapanion. Altbough be bad reacbed a certain
age, and bad bad a serious heart attack, bis
doctor bad told him that be was in A-i condition and there was no danger in undertaking
this trip. We bad scarcely arrived at tbe Plaza
Hotel, wbere the Canadian delegation was to
stay, wben be suffered a very serious heart
attack. He was located next door to my room,
and be knocked on my wall and I got bis
signal. I went to see bim and I bad to
sunimon a doctor to bis bedside. Tbe doctor
came immediately and took a cardiogram. I
interpreted for Senator Stambaugb for the
ten days we remained there. He was unable
to leave bis room.
Honourable senators, tbat is an experience
that would bring one close to a man. 1 bad
become one of bis closest friends, and I would
not have hesitated to accompany hlm on any
fishing trip. He and I had at least one thing in
common-we were ardent fishermen.
I knew Senator Stambaugh to be a fine
man, and a great bumanitarian. On behaif of
the Leader of tbe Opposition and of tbis
group, I offer to ail the members of bis family
our sincerest condolences.

SENATE DEBATES
STATUTE LAW (SUPPLEMENTARY RETIREMENT BENEFITS> AMENDMENT
ACT, 1970
FIRST READING

The Hon. the Speaker informed the
Senate that a message had been received
from the House of Commons with Bill C-194,
to provide supplementary retirement benefits
for certain persons in receipt of pensions payable out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund
and to amend certain Acts that provide for
the payment of those pensions.
Bill read first time.
SECOND READING-DEBATE ADJOURNED

The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, when shall this bill be read the second
tirne?
Han. John J. Cannolly: Honourable senators, notwithstanding Rule 44(l)(f), which
requires two days' notice be given for second
reading of a bill, 1 would ask that the Senate
give unanimous consent to move second reading of this bill this evening because of the
imminence of the recess.
The Hon. the Speaker: Is it agreed that
honourable Senator Connolly move second
reading now?
Han. Senators: Agreed.
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West), with
leave of the Senate, moved the second reading of the bill.
He said: Honourable senators, I understand
that copies of Bil C-194, have been distributed. This bull has been slightly amended, but
with the kind of explanation I propose ta
give, I feel that it would be a rather futile
exercise ta attempt ta follow the bull owing ta
the fact that it invalves many changes in
various acts. It seemed ta me, therefore, that
it would be far more intelligible to bonourahie senators, and certainly a lot easier for
your humble servant, if I were ta, discuss the
bill in general terms, infarm yau what its
effects are, and then mave that it be sent ta a
cammittee where a detailed, section-by-sectian examinatian of its provisions could be
undertaken. I will undertake ta send it ta a
committee.
Despite my suggestion that reference ta the
bil would be futile, nevertheless, I arn first
going ta refer to the bill. Schedule A, at page
39 of the bill, lists the variaus persans or
groups ta wbich the bill applies. That list
includes in numerical arder from anie ta six
[Hon. Mr. Choquette.]

March 23, 1970
Mrh2,17

the following persans or groups: The Gavernor General; Members of Parliament; members of the Senate; judges; non-career
diplomats-other
diplomats
covered
by
tbe Public Service :Superannuation Act. The
Public Service itself comprises items six ta
ten; the Canadian Armed Forces, items il
and 12; the Royal Canadian Mounted Police,
13 and 14; and the employees of the Mint, 15.
Perhaps honourable senators would be
interested ta know that until 1930 the
employees of the Royal Canadian Mint and
their pension rights were covered by an act
of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. Ail
those persans have since retired. The hast one
retired, I understand, in 1969, but the pensions they get under that act are affected by
this bill.
Generally speaking, this bill would increase
the pensions now provided by law. There are
some other general provisions in the preliminary part of the bill ta which 1 should make
reference. The preliminary part deals first
witb the amount of the increase and also with
the accounting procedures required ta make
these increases effective. Furthermore, it
deals with the persans who will receive the
increases. Broadly speaking, they are pensioners of 60 years of age or over. Those pensioners below the age of 60 years will continue ta
receive pensions at the rate of payment they
now receive until they reach their sixtieth
birtbday, and thereafter they will qualify for
the increases provided for in tbis bill. However, disabled persans under the age of 60
and the survivors of pensioners will receive
the increases provided for by this measure,
regardless of age.
I sbould tell honourable senators next that
the increases provided for in the bull will
become effective on April 1 this year, but
there will be variations in the amount of
benefit in accordance with the date of retirement of the pensioner. For thîs reason I have
caused ta be distributed ta honourable senators a sheet of foolscap beaded "Percentage
Factors Derived from. Schedule B of Bill
C-194". This looks like a formidable document, and certainiy without explanation it
would be rather incomprehensible. Actually,
it is a very simple document. Ail it says is
that a man or woman wbo retired in 1952 or
earlier will now receive, because of the
increase in the cost of living since that date,
an addition ta bis or ber pension of 42.8 per
cent. Honourable senators will see that it is
graduated down, say, ta 1960, and for persans
wbo retired in that year, the increase in the
rate payable will be 22.4 per cent. Looking at

March 23, 1970

DEBATES
Marc 23,1970SENATE

the bottom of the page, bonourable senators
will see that a man or woman who retired in
1969 wül receive an increase in pension of 2
per cent. Generally speaking, the increases in
the percentage of pension provided in this
measure bave been based on the increases in
the cost of living since 1952. Tbe ceiling is the
percentage derived from the Canada Pension
Plan increase wbich is 2 per cent.
By way of sumimarization, the bill proposes
to increase the amount payable to pensioners
who have been on pension since 1952, or earlier, up to tbe present time by tbe amount by
wbicb. the cost of living increased year by
year. That is the significance of the extra
sheet, bonourable senators, wbich you may
now discard.
On first inspection, Schedule B is perhaps
difficuit to understand, but it too bears a
simple explanation. Say the cost of living in
the year 1970 is 100, then in 1952 the cost of
living was 70.03. This is an index only, and
the scbedule shows the increases in the cost
of living since 1952, again with tbe 2 per cent
ceiling under the Canada Pension Plan which
bas been applied.
The increases which nre contemplated to be
made to the pensions are without the deductions that are applied for hospital insurance
premiums, income tax and wbatever otber
deductions are normaily made from pension
cheques.
Clause 7 of the bil contains this important
provision: Every pensioner or his estate wfll
draw as a minimum the amount he bas paid
into this fund, without interest.
This was not provided in the bull passed in
1965 with respect to retirement of senators. I
do not think it applied to the Members of
Parliament Retirlag Ailowances Act eitber. It
is a good provision because there are members of the other place and senators who wMl
not have been able to serve the full six years
required before a pension or the increase
becomes operative, and if they do not serve
again in Parliament, then at least they or
their estate wMl have the return of the
aniount they have paid in.
There are appropriate accounts established
ini the prellminary part of the bil. The
account covering the increases to be paid on
these various types of pensions wiil be called
Benefits
Retirement
Supplementary
the
Account.
I think that is ail honourable senators
would really care to know about the general
provisions of the bil.

May I deal next wlth the Members of Parliament Retiring AlIlowances Act. This benefits some honourable senators who corne
under that act because of their service in the
other place. The present members of the
House of Commons can elect to join the new
plan within a year and to pay for prior service-that I will explain in a moment. Future
Members of Parlianient and former Members
of Parliament who become members again at
some future time will join the new plan
automatically. In other words, it is a compulsory plan from now on.
The contributions are an important factor.
A Member of Parliament who elects to corne
under this plan must contribute 7j per cent
of bis indemnity, which is presently $12,000,
plus his tax-free expense allowance of $6,000.
This can be done for bis current service and
for the entire present session. The additional
contributions for service back to the opening
of this session can be paid off by the member
in instalments. A member can elect to contribute in a lump sum, or by instalments at
the rate of 7j per cent of the sessional allowance plus bis indemnity, at any time for the
period since April 8, 1963, with interest. That
date is important because that was when the
îndemnity was increased from $8,000 to
$12,000. So, he can pay on that back service,
if he bas been in the house during that
period, at the new rate of '7j per cent. Interest is payable on past service contributions.
Honourable senators, I must apologize. I arn
a little abead of myself, but perhaps I may
corne back later to the point I have rnissed. I
will continue to talk about the position of the
members of the other bouse.
In addition to the 7j per cent which. tbe
members wrnl pay on their indemnity plus the
expense allowance, tbey wiil pay for the
additional benefits provided i this bll a further one-haif of 1 per cent, starting on April
1, 1970. In orner words, a Member of Parliament wîfl be paying 8 per cent on $18,000,
which cornes to $1,440 a year. Under the present act he is paying $720. A minimum period
of six years as a member would be required
to qualify for the pension benefits provided
under this bil. Otherwise a return of contributions, without interest, is payable, as I have
ak.eady mentioned.
What are the benefits? What are the additional advantages that flow from the increase in the amount of the contributions
stlpulated?
First, I should say that the benefits would
be payable inmmediately upon retiremient,
based on the average of the indernnity and

SENATE DEBATES

expense allowance received over the best six
years of the member's pensionable service.
Perhaps it would be easier were I to illustrate
these benefits with figures.
In the first 10 years, assuming that the
indemnity plus the expense allowance is
$18,000 and remains at that level, each
member would get $630 for each year; or, in
10 years a total of $6,300-worth of pension
benefits will have been built up. For the following 10 years his pension entitlement would
increase by $540 a year, for a total of $5,400.
Then for a five-year period, if he should
remain in the house so long, be will build up
his entitlement to further pension at the rate
of 2 per cent, or $360, for each of those five
years, or a total of $1,800. The total of those
three amounts for the first ten years at 3' per
cent, the second ten years at 3 per cent, and
the next five years at 2 per cent, is $13,500.
The maximum that a member could receive
is 75 per cent of his best six-year average. If
the indemnity plus the expense allowance
remains at $18,000, then within 25 years he
shall have reached the maximum of $13,500,
and his payments stop.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: How many will be in
that category?
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): I cannot
say, but I do not think there are many at the
present time. The honourable Leader of the
Government in this house is one, perhaps the
Chairman of the Special Committee of the
Senate on Poverty is another, and Senator
White is another. There is a small club which
knows pretty well who its members are, but
there are not too many left. The Right
Honourable John Diefenbaker and the
Honourable George McIlraith are two more.

March 23, 1970

service. I should say immediately that the
Income Tax Act does provide that it is permissible to make a contribution of $1,500 for
prior pension service each year without
attracting tax, and a contribution of $1,500
for current service without attracting tax.
The money that is paid in, for either prior or
current service, under this provision of the
Income Tax Act will be taxable only when
the pensioner takes the benefit of it.
In addition to the benefits which are provided by the act for the pensioner, there are
also survivor's benefits, and these are very
important. Sixty per cent of the rnember's
pension entitlement goes to the widow or
widower of the pensioner. In addition, if there
is a surviving parent, 10 per cent of the member's pension entitlement will go to each child
up to a total of three children. If there is no
surviving parent, then 20 per cent of the
member's pension entitlement will go to each
child up to a total of four. A child's benefit to
the pension will continue to age 18, or to age
25 if the child is still being educated.
In the case of a member who decides not to
come under the new plan I think the difference will be that he contributes on a sessional
indemnity plus his expense allowance at the
rate of 62 per cent.
Hon. Mr. Croll: I thought the honourable
senator said it was compulsory.

Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): The plan
is compulsory, but you do not have to pick up
your past service.
Before I come to the situation in respect of
senators, which perhaps is the least part of
this bill, I want to retrace my steps and interject here some remarks that escaped me as I
was turning over my notes.
Hon. Mr. Haig: There are about seven.
Under this measure there will be no contributions towards these increases from the

SENATE DEBATES

mendations were adopted, but there were certain exceptions. He recommended, for example, that the pension of M.P.'s should start at
age 55 and that the contribution should be 7
per cent. The bill provides, however, that an
M.P. can retire at any time after serving six
years, and that the rate of contribution shall
be 7j per cent.
Another provision I should have mentioned-it applies to only a few of us-is that
ministers, leaders, speakers, and others who
have extra indemnity, can pay even retroactively at the rate of 7j per cent on that
extra indemnity, and thus shorten the period
of time over which they have to pay the 8 per
cent.
I might say that this will not apply in my
case, for example, because while I did receive
extra indemnity while I was a member of the
Government, I was under the Retirement of
Senators Act which was passed in June of
1965. It applies only to persons who are under
the Members of Parliament Retiring Allowances Act, and not to those who are under the
Retirement of Senators Act. I am not saying
that by way of criticism or to suggest that an
amendment be made in my favour!
I hope honourable senators will not ask me
about specific situations or individual cases.
Perhaps I should set up a law office with one
of the experts from the department. For a
good fee we would be happy to advise what
an individual's position is. If I do not do that,
I am sure that there will be some expert who
will do it. I have not even calculated what my
own position will be. Every individual will
have to consider the provisions very carefully
and see how they affect him.
With reference to senators' pensions under
Bill C-194, I should refer to the Statutes of
Canada, 1965, 14 Elizabeth II, chapter 4,
Retirement of Senators Act, which was passed
in that year. I do not intend to review the
provisions of the act. However, I will discuss
senators who are under a life tenure, namely,
those who were appointed before June 2,
1965. In the case of such senators, those who
are beyond the age of 75 years wil be given
an additional opportunity to resign on a pension if they do so before April 1, 1971, a year
from the coming April 1. Those who are
under 75 can provide widows' annuities in the
event of their death before 75 by giving
notice of their intention to resign from the
Senate upon attaining their 75th birthday.
Honourable senators will remember that
under the old act the actual age for retirement for what I facetiously call the lifers was
actually the 76th birthday. Under this option

if they give notice within the year before
April 1, 1971 that they intend to retire at 75
years of age there is a guarantee that if they
should die before that period has elapsed
their widows will receive the pension. In my
opinion this is a very helpful provision.
Senator Choquette: What type of pension
will it be and how much?
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): Do you
mind, Senator Choquette, if I come to that
very shortly. I would like to put one or two
other general observations on the record. As a
matter of fact, I am coming to your point
now. There is provision for an improvement
in the widows' pensions and for a minimum
benefit of return of contributions, which I
have already mentioned. The widow's benefit
at the present time is two-ninths of the sessional indemnity paid to the senator at the
time his annuity is granted, which amounts to
$2,667. There is a provision in the bill which
increases the widow's pension to a maximum
of $4,000, which would require contributions
of approximately 18 years service in the
Senate.
The widow's benefit is as follows:
(a) two-ninths of the sessional indemnity
payable to the Senator at the time the
annuity was granted to him, or
(b) the lesser of
(i) thirty percent of the amount the
Senator contributed to the Consolidated
Revenue Fund
(il) one-third of the sessional indemnity
payable to the Senator at the time the
annuity was granted to him,
whichever is the greater.
This is pretty bad verbiage but, as I say, the
minimum pension to which a widow or widower is entitled is $2,667. It can increase,
depending upon the number of years of service, to a maximum of $4,000 for the widow.
If the indemnities should be increased at
some time there would be a proportionate
increase in these benefits.
Some of our colleagues are under the Members of Parliament Retiring Allowances Act
and one enjoys a life tenure. Al those
appointed since June 2, 1965, are under the
Members of Parliament Retiring Allowances
Act. The lifers pay from now 6j per cent of
$12,000 into the pension fund. Those who
must retire at 75 years of age will pay 6j
per cent of $15,000, which is $12,000 indemnity plus $3,000 expense allowance, with corresponding benefits. Present members of the
Senate under the Members of Parliament

SENATE DEBATES
Retiring Allowances Act can elect to join the
new plan within a year. Repayment may then
be made for prior service. Al who are hereafter appointed to the Senate will automatically join the new plan.
A senator who elects to come under the
new plan must contribute 6 per cent of the
sessional allowance, plus the expense allowance for current service and for the duration
of the present session. Additional contributions for service since October 23, 1969, the
day upon which this session began, can be
paid by instalments as provided in the bill. A
senator can elect to contribute in a lump sum
or in instalments at the rate of 6 per cent of
his expense allowance received since June 2,
1965, with interest. The reason is that there
are persons under this act who have been paying only on their indemnity. They can now
pay on the expense allowance they have received since June 2, 1965, for which they receive an additional benefit in proportion to
the additional contribution they make. Interest
is payable on past service contributions. A
senator receiving an additional salary or allowance may contribute up to 7 f per cent of
that salary received in any year, thereby obtaining a larger pension for the same period
of service and shortening the time required to
obtain the maximum pension. This would
apply to both current and past service in
earlier Parliaments. Interest, of course, is
payable on past service contributions and, as
in the Members of Parliament Retiring
Allowances Act, an additional one-half of one
per cent is payable for the pension increase.
In order to be eligible to receive the benefits under this act, senators must serve a
minimum period of six years, failing which
return of contributions without interest is
payable. In other words, if a senator must
retire within the period of six years he will
have paid in a certain amount of money at
the rate of $720 per year. On his retirement
this amount will be recovered. This is a new
provision. The benefits provided by the bill
under the Members of Parliament Retiring
Allowances Act are payable immediately,
based on the average of the sessional allowance and the expense allowance received over
the best six years of pensionable service.
Perhaps it would be helpful if I put this on
the record, though it repeats the formula for
Members of Parliament. The rate for a senator
is 3 per cent on $15,000 or $450 per year. The
overall maximum he can receive is 75 per
cent of the best six-year average, which is
$11,250 after 25 years. This is considerably
better, of course, than the amount of $8,000
[Hon. Mr. Connolly

(Ottawa West).1

received by a senator with a life tenure. These
computations are based upon the present indennity plus expense allowance.
In the calculation I have just given, a year
of pensionable service will be credited each
time a senator contributed 6 per cent of the
sessional allowance plus expense allowance
received since April 8, 1963. At the present
time this would mean one year's pensionable
service for every $900 contributed as a
senator.
Survivor's benefits under this bill for the
senator are the same as those for the Member
of Parliament: 60 per cent of the member's
pension entitlement to the widow or widower.
If there is a surviving parent, 10 per cent of
the member's pension entitlement goes to
each child, up to three children; if there is no
surviving parent, 20 per cent of member's
pension entitlement for each child up to four.
I have probably succeeded in confusing
honourable senators completely on what this
measure means. This I can well understand,
because it is obviously pre-eminently a bill
for committee. It is not a bill in respect of
which the precise position of each honourable
senator can be given. As a matter of fact, it
is rather difficult to analyze what the position
of the Member of Parliament is or the position
of the civil servant, but generally speaking I
think the sheet I have passed around to honourable senators indicates the percentage of
increase in pensions for those who are Members of Parliament or not. For those who are
Members of Parliament there are these special
provisions, over which I have perhaps taken
too much time.
I can summarize this by referring first to
the situation of senators appointed before
June 2, 1965, who did not elect to contribute
under the Members of Parliament Retirement
Act. These are persons enjoying the life
tenure. A senator of 75 years or under can
retire on account of age, if he resigns within
a year of attaining the age of 75, and receive
a pension of $8,000 per annum for life. He
may retire on account of disability before
attaining the age of 75 and be eligible for a
pension of $8,000 per annum for life. If he
should die, under the present act passed in
1965 his widow would get a benefit only if he
were on retirement. Under the new bill, if
before April 1, 1971 he indicates in writing
his intention to resign on attaining the age of
75, his widow-or the widower-will be entitled to receive the survivors benefit of the
pension. Senators who are now 76 or over can
at the present time retire, if they are disa-

bled, and receive a pension of $8,000. Under
this bill they can retire and receive a pension
of $8,000 on account of age alone, if they do
so before April 1, 1971. They are given a
second chance.
On the question of death, for senators now
76 years or over, under the existing law the
widow's benefit is applicable only if the senator has retired and is receiving an annuity.
Under the proposed change, the widow's
benefit will be granted on the resignation of
the senator either because of age within the
year or because of disability. The amount of
the widow's benefit under the present law is
$2,667, and is fixed at that amount. Under the
proposed new law it can increase, and after
some 18 years of contributory service it can
reach a figure of $4,000. The minimum benefit
in any case is a return of contributions.
Hon. Mr. Lamontagne: Without interest.
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): Without
interest.
For senators who are contributing under
the Members of Parliament Retiring Allowances Act, the contribution at the present
time is 6 per cent of the indemnity, or $720 a
year. Under the proposed bill it will be 6 per
cent of the indemnity plus allowance, or $900
a year. The eligibility for immediate annual
allowance under the present act requires
them to have served in three parliaments.
Under the proposed legislation they will be
entitled if they serve six full years as a
Member of Parliament. The senator's allowances under the present law increase at the
rate of $300 a year since 1965. Under the
proposed new law they will increase at the
rate of $450 a year commencing October 23,
1969.
Previously, senators receiving additional
salary or allowances for additional duties had
no right to pay on those back services. However, under the present law they can do so at
the rate of 7j per cent. The maximum
allowance for senators under the Members of
Parliament Retiring Allowances Act now is
$9,000. Under the new law it will be 75 per
cent of the average indemnity plus expense,
over the highest six years. This will amount
to slightly more than $11,000.
The widow's allowance, which is 60 per
cent at death, will remain the saie. Under
the present law there is no provision for children, but under the proposed one there will
be.
Honourable senators, that is the best explanation I can make of a very complicated bill.

If it receives second reading, I will recommend that it be referred to the Standing
Committee on Banking, Trade and Commerce.
Hon. J. Campbell Haig: I am sure the house
appreciates the difficult position of Senator
Connolly in explaining this complex bill, with
its many different applications. Some have
been members of the House of Commons and
retired from that place and some are lifers-a
term which I do not like to use. Those
appointed for life, I think is a better expression. Then, there are those who are subject to
compulsory retirement at age 75. I do not
think Senator Connolly would have the
answer to the question I have in mind at the
moment.
I give notice now that when the bill goes to
the Standing Senate Comnittee on Banking,
Trade and Commerce, I shall ask why a present retired member of the House of Commons, who now happens to be a member of
the Senate, and is entitled to the pension and
is receiving it, cannot have the election or the
option which is given the former members of
the House of Commons, who are entitled
under the House of Commons Retirement Act.
I understand from a quick glance that there
are 177 pensioners.
Hon. Mr. Croll: I think you are mistaken.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I might be wrong, Senator
Croll. I received this bill a little earlier than
you did, and I took a quick glance at it.
All I am asking of the sponsor of the bill is
that when it goes to the Banking, Trade and
Commerce Committee, if he would give the
number of the members of the Senate who
were entitled to a pension under the House of
Commons Retirement Act. From a brief
glance this afternoon, I understand it is about
seven or eight. I would like that information.
As I understand it, a former member of the
House of Commons who is a member of the
Senate has the right to elect or take up the
option of paying back a certain amount of
money which would entitle him to a larger
pension, whereas a former member of the
House of Commons who is not a member of
the Senate does not have that right. My suggestion to the sponsor is that when he discusses this with his officials and Senator Croll,
who will probably give a good deal of information to the committee, that he ask why
in equity you differentiate between those
former members of the House of Commons
who are entitled to make this selection or
option and those who are not.

to $676,032,812.
3. Included in the said Supplementary
Estimates (B) were thirty items of one
dollar each. It has been customary for
your committee to scrutinize such items
closely and titis has again been done. The
committee was supplied with a list containing an explanation on each item.
Eight of these items are legisiative in
nature. Your committee reiterates its concern about the practice of making statutory changes by means of Appropriation
Acts based on supplementary Estimates.
There may be instances of minor importance, or of special urgency where this
method. could be justifled, and it is the
practice now of the committee to obtain
full information as to these items.
Attached to the printed report of the proceedings of the committee, wiil be the list
with the explanations.
4. The practice of amending statutes
through one dollar items can lead to the
saine practice on other items involving
substantial. expenditures, thereby bringing about changes that are also legislative
in character that should properly be
brought about by substantive statutes
rather than by Appropriation Acts. 0f
such a character in these Supplementary
Estiinates (B) is Vote 17b of the Department of Agriculture, a grant of $100,000,000 for payments to be made in the fiscal
year 1970-71 for purposes of wheat acreage reduction, this vote being the largest
single item in the supplementary Estimates and representing nearly one-haif of
the total amounit of the Estimates. Your
committee is not critical of the purpose
for which this sum. is to be used, nor of
the amount of the vote, but it is strongly
of the view that the importance of the
subi ect matter and the extent of the
changes intended to be brought about in
so essential a part of the Canadian economy as is constituted by our wheat producers, require the usual and proper
method for Parliamentary action, namely,
a substantive bull with ail the appropriate
clauses setting out the intended purposes
of the legislation and going through the
required readings and debates as prescribed by the Rules of the respective
Houses of Parliament. Furthermore,
while the Vote is included in the supplementary Estimates for the fiscal year
1969-70, the committee points out that the

expenditures to the producers will be
incurred in the 1970-71 fiscal year, and
subsequently, and this again is a practice
of doubtful propriety in the opinion of
your committee.
5. Your comntittee is further of the
opinion that it is desirable in the reprinting of Statutes to show by marginal
notations those instances where Appropriation Acts have made in effect changes
in existing Statutes, as for example in the
case of the Canada Wheat Board Act
which is affected by Vote 17b of the
Department of Agriculture above mentioned.

Hon. John J. Kinley: Honourable senators,
before making some remarks with regard to
Bil C-175, may I say I was intensely interested in the tributes paid this evening to the
Honourable J. Wesley Stambaugh, a former
senator whom I knew slightly. Having heard
what was said, I wondered why such a man
would retire at the age of 75. We were given
at first the impression that hie retired because
hie thought we should ail retire at 75. However, when Senator Aseltine spoke we discovered that the late Senator Stamnbaugh had an
infirmity and that hie retired partly because
of ill-health.
I arn glad we heard that remark, because
we who are over 75 may feel there was an
inference that we also should retire. I have no
intention of retiring yet.
[Hon. Mr. Ijrquart.]

Mrh2.17

I amn glad also that we had a pension bil,
because those who have given long service
have been given inducements to retire. Well, I
,like being here and as long as I arn well in
my mind and my body and can make a contribution, I think I wili stay around.
Honourable senators, on thîs bull before the
house, I expected to hear the report of the
committee. I suppose the report has been
presented.
I expected Senator Hayden to be present
and arn sorry he is not here. If I were not;
going away tomorrow, I would wait until hie
came back in order that hie could take this
up, as some of the things I wish to say are
such that perhaps the chaîrman of the coinmittee would wish to comment on them.
First I refer to section 121 of the British
North Amnerica Act, which. says:
121. Ail1 articles of the Growth, Produce,
or Manufacture of any one of the Provinces shahl, fromn and after the Union, be
admitted free into each of the other
Provinces.
Senator Hayden, in referring to section 121
of the British North America Act, having
quoted it, said ail it means is that they
can move without customs duties, and that
goods can move from one province to, another
without payment of customs duties.
It seems to me that the important word, as
given in section 121, is "free". That word is
used there without limitation or qualification.
As a lay member I took that to mean exactly
what it said in its greatest interpretation. I did
not know, as a member of the Senate, that
our relations with the rest of Canada were 50
limited and restricted.
After I had spoken, Senator Lang, a distinguished member of the Bar, said hie rather
agreed that there was some question whether
this was not ultra vires.
I amn not for one moment questioning the
opinion of the chairman, who is a distinguished lawyer and who has had experience
before the Privy Council on such matters as
this, but I do thînk that people generally
should know the condition of history that
existed at the moment of Confederation. And
if there is a wrong, then it is time it should
be remedied. I believe we are approaching the
tirne when such remedy can be considered. In
other words, when I refer to, the word "free"'
ini section 121, which is there without qualification, I see the time is opportune for it to be
made widely known what it does mean.

large amount of money over the last year.
They have up to March 31 this year to complete the payments, and I have no doubt
that that is why this bill is now before the
house.
I would like to quote to you the following
extract from the bill:
(2) The board may, for the purposes of
this section, make by-laws providing for
the issue of licences by the corporation
and prescribing the form of and the terms
and conditions to be set forth in such
licences.
Then it goes on to say:
The Governor in Council may, by regulations, exempt from the application of
all or any of the provisions of this part,
either conditionally or unconditionally...
And so it goes on. Honourable senators have
heard the remarks by honourable Senators
Thompson, Grosart and O'Leary on the dangers inherent in delegated legislation. They
pointed out how bad a thing this could be for
Canada, and how it could detract from the
prominence of Parliament. I was impressed
by this as indeed were other members of the
house. But, honourable senators, that situation applies to the provisions of this bill. That
is why I decided to say a few words on third
reading. If under this section of the bill the
efficient element of the industry can get the
same treatment as those who form the corporation, it will be salutary, because it leaves an
element of free trade or free enterprise in the
industry, and this should be encouraged.
It seems to me that better land transportation in Newfoundland and good refrigeration
is needed. Water transportation in Newfoundland is now most advantageous, especially for fresh fish. With regard to saltfish, it
can be made even more so. Senator Carter
says that hook and line fish are the best, and
I agree with him, and that is the way the
fishermen work on the remote coasts of Newfoundland and Labradaor. In my grandfather's time, which was many years ago, they
caught fish in traps in Labrador. They also
used the big Labrador boats and traps.
Honourable senators, there has to be a different approach to the sale of fish. For example, you must have effective advertising. At
Dinty Moore's Restaurant in Boston they
advertise corned beef and cabbage as their
specialty, but you can get almost anything
you want to eat. At the Parker House in
Boston, for many years their specialty was
Boston Scrod, a small codfish which is taste[Hon. Mr. Kinley.]

March 23, 1970

fully prepared. Everyone knows about it all
over the New England States. Whenever I go
to Boston, the first thing I ask for is good
Boston Scrod. I say this, honourable senators,
to point out that we should do more advertising along that line.
As I said, this saltfish is caught mostly by
the fishermen on the remote coasts of Newfoundland and in the Gaspé and other places
where they have excellent natural facilities
for curing the catch. They have the sunlight
to cure the fish, and I agree with Senator
Carter when he says that sun-cured fish is
best. I know from my own experience that
they have a better smell because it is a more
refreshlng way to do it; the sunshine and the
clean water of the Atlantic for washing the
fish make for a superior product.
In California they talk of the Sunkist
oranges, so why should we not talk of the
sun-cured fish of Newfoundland or the Gaspé
or Nova Scotia. If we were to do so, I think
we would be able to procure a larger share of
the market, and we would be doing a service
to our fishermen. Of course, they must work
in the summertime because the winter is not
a good time for them. Many fishermen cure
their own fish and this gives them and their
families employment at home.
Honourable senators, as I have said before,
Newfoundland needs better roads, better
transportation and refrigeration so that they
can deliver fresh fish to the big industries.
Also, as I said, there should be more free
enterprise and the industry should not be
bound up in this way. Furtherinore, it should
be competitive because competition means
that they will get more for their product.
They are getting a splendid price now
because there is a shortage, with the result
that saltfish costs twice what fresh fish costs.
It is the same as the situation with corned
beef which is now more expensive than fresh
beef because there is more work involved in
its preparation.
Honourable senators, it would seem that
production from Nova Scotia is almost certain
to be excluded. I have been told that by a
civil servant in committee. It looks as if they
give you answers on policy. I hope that what
he told us is true. I am glad I got that information from him in committee because it will
be well received down in my part of the
country, but I must say I would rather see it
in the bill. As honourable senators are aware,
the committee met at 9 o'clock in the morning
which is rather a difficult hour, but we had a
good discussion and the chairman was completely fair. The committee voted seven to

SENATE DEBATES

However, I was pleased to see that two distinguished commercial men in the Senate from
Nova Scotia, one on the Opposition side and
one on the Government side, agreed with my
presentation in committee.
I do not think I can do anything at this
hour to change this bill, which is to come into
force by proclamation; it certainly is not to
come into effect when it passes this house. I
think that before the bill is proclaimed by the
Governor in Council a third look should be
taken at it. This is the second look, and I
hope that a third look is taken at it and that
the interests of the little man in Nova Scotia,
the Gaspé and Prince Edward Island will be
considered. Al the big industries discarded
the salt fish business years ago, but it is
something that is a bulwark for the little man
because he can do this in the summer time.
He probably bas a little farm, in Nova Scotia
at least, where he can live cheaply. He is a
man who populates the more remote parts of
the province along the coast. We do not want
to bring them all into the cities, as is trying to
be done now. We think the life of this type
of man is good, and with education, the telephone and television he wil have all the
opportunities of the man in the city and, in
fact, will have a more pleasant life. He should
be helped, and while it costs $14 million
to sustain the country's end of the business
this year, I hope that this corporation, which
bas a rather heavy overhead, will be able to
do something. I hope the people who have
virtue and are efficient will not be left outside
the provisions of this bill, and I am glad that
to a certain extent this is so in Nova Scotia.
Motion agreed to and bill read third time
and passed.

STATUTORY INSTRUMENTS
PROPOSED STUDY OF PROCEDURES BY LEGAL
AND CONSTITUTIONAL AFFAIRS COMMITTEFEDEBATE CONTINUED
The Senate resumed from Thursday, March
19, the adjourned debate on the motion of
Hon. Mr. Martin that the Standing Senate
Committee on Legal and Constitutional
Affairs be instructed to consider and, from
time to time, to report on procedures for the
review by the Senate of instruments made in
virtue of any statute of the Parliament of
Canada, and to consider in connection therewith any public documents relevant thereto.

Prowse:

Honourable

The Hon. the Speaker: Is it agreed, honourable senators, that the honourable Senator
Prowse should speak now instead of the
honourable Senator Lamontagne?
Hon. Senators: Agreed.
Hon. Mr. Prowse: Honourable senators, it is
not my intention to keep you long, but there
are one or two points I think should be made
and I must take this opportunity to make
them.
The motion we are now discussing which
was set out by the honourable Leader of the
Government in the Senate, is a suggestion to
refer the report of the other place on statutory orders to the Standing Senate Committee
on Legal and Constitutional Affairs in order
to report on procedures, to investigate the
matter and, I assume, to make recommendations to the Senate as to how it can effectively serve the public requirements with regard
to the review of subordinate or delegated
legislation.
Without boring you by figures that are
dealt with at complete length in the report, I
think it sufficient to point out that of 601
statutes in the present Canadian statutes,
more than 400 provide for delegated legislation; and that there are nearly 7,000 regulations under these various statutes, Orders in
Council and prerogatives of the Crown, covering approximately 20,000 pages. When you
keep in mind that the statutes contain a great
many things that really do not concern the
law but concern the setting up of bodies to
administer the law, it becomes clear, in the
light of these figures, that since 1956 a great
many more of the particular pieces of legislation that affect the day-to-day life and business decisions of this country are determined
by statutory regulations of one kind or anoth-

SENATE DEBATES
er in the federal area alone-and it is worse
in the provincial area-than are determined
by acts of Parliament. When one realizes that,
then I think one begins to appreciate the concern which has been expressed in many
places that we do not as yet have in this
country any procedure for the regular, proper
and constitutional review of the type of regulations to which our people are being subject,ed twice a day, on the basis of the average
time it takes for new orders and regulations
to come out.
There is scarcely any limit to the areas
which can be covered or to the effect of the
legislation which can be passed by administrative bodies by virtue of the general enabling legislation.
The report sets out in some detail and the
evidence upon which the report is based contains more detail on the problems that are
involved. First, there are problems involved
in the drafting of the enabling legislation.
Then there are problems in the drafting of
the subordinate legislation. Then, of course,
there are the problems involved in determining whether the legislation as it finally
appears has been properly made available to
the public, and whether it is legally within
the terms of the enabling legislation.
The number of problems involved goes on
and on, and honourable senators can read
thern in the report. There they are stated much
more concisely and interestingly than would
be possible for me to put them at this time.
Generally speaking, anyone who had anything to do with this problem of delegated
legislation and its importance is agreed on
this one fact, that unless Parliament is to
almost abdicate its legislative responsibilities
to the executive or to the civil service we
must provide some effective control in the
first instance, and review in the second,
which does not exist at the present time.
The report of the committee of the other
place suggested that the review should be
done by a special committee of the House or
Commons. In order to appreciate that recommendation fully I think it would be well to
refer to the Votes and Proceedings of the
House of Commons of October 27, 1969 which
contains this report. I would read from page
1490:
The committee was divided over the
question of the desirability of a Joint
Committee of both Houses as opposed to
a Standing Committee of the House of
Commons alone, as some members felt
that the non-elective and non-representative character of the Senate made it
[Hon. Mr. Prowse.]

March 23, 1970

unsuitable for this role; but in the light
of its terrns of reference, which required
it "to report on procedures for the review
by this house of instruments made in
virtue of any statute of the Parliament of
Canada"It is unfortunate, I think, that the writer of
the report felt called upon to add the suggestion that the non-elective and non-representative character of the Senate made it unsuitable for this role, and was not content to
follow his terrms of reference. If we leave it at
that, perhaps that is the best we can do, but I
think I would say at this time that I become a
little weary of listening to carping criticisn of
this institution from recently arrived persons
in the public service, based on the claim that
this body is not representative or responsible.
In the first instance, let it be clearly understood that we do not appoint ourselves to this
house. The Government of the day takes the
responsibility for appointments to the Senate,
and it must answer for them. So, we are just
as responsible to the public as are judges and
other public servants who are charged with
special responsibility.
Secondly, it should be kept in mind that we
do not have to try to fly with every twist of
the wind, but we can follow principle as we
conceive it and as it steers us, to the logical
and proper conclusions that we hope will best
serve the interests of the people of Canada.
Once we are appointed to the Senate, there is
nothing anybody can do for us or to us; moreover, we cannot be given any other appointment. For instance, we cannot be elevated
froms the District Court bench to the Supreme
Court bench. We are distinct from any other
group of citizens in this country, in that we
have no need to serve anything except the
needs of the people of Canada, and we need
answer to no one, but to live in the hope of a
clear conscience when the time comes for us
to die. If there is another way by which the
people can be better served, I would like to
hear it.
The sad thing about this is that the members of this chamber are overworked, as are
the members of the other place. How the
members of the other place are able to do
their job at all, I do not know. There are
demands made upon thern by the house in
which they sit, by the committees of that
house to which they have been appointed, by
the committees of the caucus, and by the
constituencies to which they must answer.
How they can meet those demands, and at the
same time acquire the tremendous amount of
knowledge that it is necessary for thern to

have if they are to make the sound decisions
that the people of Canada are entitled to have
from them, is beyond me.
If it be true that the ordinary member of
the other place is so assailed by responsibilities
that lack of time makes it impossible for him
to discharge to his own satisfaction, how
much more is it true that the members of the
executive charged with the responsibility of
finally administering the laws which we pass
must find it impossible to make the kind of
judgments necessary to develop future policies. If we have troubles in this country today
that nobody seems to be able to solve, then I
submit that the basic reason is not that
nobody wishes to solve them, but because
neither the cabinet, nor the House of Commons, nor this house, have their time organized in such a way that they are able to get
the information necessary to make the decisions that will have to be made.

Hon. Mr. Fournier (De Lanaudière):
Honourable senators, before the adjournment I would like to ask one question.
With reference to the wording of the motion that the Standing Senate Committee on
Legal and Constitutional Affairs be instructed
to consider and, from time to time, to report
on procedures, I would like to know where
that will lead and exactly what it means with
respect to the review by the Senate of instruments made in virtue of any statute of the
Parliament of Canada, and to consider in connection therewith any public documents relevant thereto. Where will the words, "to report
on procedures" lead us and what do they
mean? I put the question to the honourable
Leader of the Government. Of course he is
not obliged to answer today.

upon which it is based, and if the information
is not available then the decision cannot be

OF QUEBEC-

On the Orders of the Day:
Hon. L. P. Beaubien: Honourable senators,
recently a minister of the provincial Government of Quebec and a minister of the federal
Government have made statements in connection with the possibility of the Province
of Quebec becoming independent of the rest
of Canada.
The problem, which a lot of us had hoped
would go away if we pretended it was not
there, has, I think, been rather loosely regarded as a provincial matter. I would like
to state that the question of separatism is
the most important federal problem that
Canada has had to face since we became a
nation 100 years ago.
Let us look at our half continent, starting
from the Atlantic side-can any sensible
person conclude that the four maritime provinces would remain within the Canadian
framework if they were separated from the
remaining five provinces by several hundred
miles of what had become a foreign country?
Going west, we find Ontario prosperous and

Would they form a mini-Canada of five provinces with Ontario, or would the pull toward

irresistible?

STATUTE LAW (SUPPLEMENTARY RETIREMENT BENEFITS) AMENDMENT
ACT, 1970
SECOND READING

The Senate resuned from yesterday the
adjourned debate on the motion of Hon. Mr.
Connolly (Ottawa West) for the second reading of Bill C-194, to provide supplementary
retirement benefits for certain persons in
receipt of pensions payable out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund and to amend certain
acts that provide for the payment of those
pensions.
Hon. Jacques Flynn: Honourable senators, I
apologize for my absence last evening. A
snowstorm prevented me from flying here in
time. I finally arrived at half-past eleven-a
bit late for the sitting. I would have liked to
follow the sponsor of this bill (Hon. Mr. Connolly, Ottawa West) last evening.
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): It is
worse here than in Russia!
Hon. Mr. Flynn: From my short experience
with snowstorms in Russia, I would agree with
the honourable senator. On the other hand,
this has given me an opportunity to read
Senator Connolly's speech of last evening. I
have read it with great care and I am satisfied that he has, as usual, given a full, complete and detailed explanation of the bill.

(Oitawa West): And

SENATE DEBATES
Hon. Mr. Flynn: I did not find it confusing.
There are a few points which remain slightly
obscure, but it is only because the senator did
not deal with them. Therefore, I do not intend
this afternoon to deal with the bill in detail at
all. I will restrict myself to very general comments except for possibly some provisions
concerning members of this house who were
appointed before 1965.
The bill deals mostly with the pension
benefits of public servants, and it improves
their situation. I have not heard any criticism
as far as this part of the bill is concerned.
Everybody seems to be in agreement that we
should give supplementary benefits to the
retiring public servants and their dependants.
The bill also deals with the pensions payable to former Members of Parliament. This is
the part of the bill which has been discussed
generally, and the only part that has incurred
negative criticism from some quarters. I do
not see any validity for such criticism.
Having examined the bill and considered the
whole picture and the circumstances, I think
that former Members of Parliament and their
dependants are not treated any better than
their
and
civil servants
retired
are
dependants.
Therefore, I do not intend to say anything
further about the negative criticism which
has been made. It comes mainly from a very
small sector of the membership in the other
place. All the criticism on this bill has come
from the same prejudiced source which has
never been very favourably disposed towards
the Senate.
In any event, as far as members of the
House of Commons are concerned, I would
say that they will obtain some adjustments
which generally apply to those members of
the Senate who have been appointed after
June 2, 1965. To be more precise, the members of the Senate appointed since June 2,
1965 do not receive exactly the same benefits
as do the retiring members of the House of
Commons, but on the whole it is the equivalent and I think it should be considered
satisfactory.
The same provisions apply also to those
senators, appointed before June 2, 1965, who
decided to take the option of retiring under
the Members of Parliament Retiring Allowances Act. When I use the plural, "senators", I
am not exactly correct, as there was but
one who chose to take this option.
As regards those senators appointed before
June 2, 1965 who did not opt to retire under
the Members of Parliament Retiring Allow[Hon. Mr. Connolly

(Ottawa West).]

March 24, 1970

ances Act, the present bill corrects to a large
extent a situation which was entirely unfair
and which has proven unjust to the families
of many of our members who have died since
the coming into force of the act in 1965.
As far as this group is concerned, I would
say roughly half of our membership are 75
years old or more. Under the present provisions, those who were aged 75 when the act
came into force, and those who reached that
age since, had the right to decide within one
year whether or not they would resign their
places in the Senate. If they did, they were
awarded a pension of two-thirds of their
indemnity, and subsequently, upon their
deaths, their widows were entitled to a pension of one-third of their pension which,
under the present rate of indemnity, is $2,667
per year.
Now, as to the senators under 75 years of
age, they had no choice of deciding whether
they would retire when reaching 75. If they
were to die in office, even after paying a
contribution of 6 per cent over I think 26
years, there was no benefit at all accruing to
their widows or other dependants, nor even a
refund of contributions to their estates. They
could pay up to something like $20,000, if I
remember correctly, and still not get a cent
out of it. It was, of course, an impossible
situation.
Naturally, those who had the option of
retiring at 75, or within one year, at least had
that option. But there was equally something
unfair as far as they were concerned, in that,
if they did not take the option to retire, and
died in office, there was no refund to their
estates of their contributions. Therefore, there
was little choice but to take the option.
Honourable senators who were here when
we dealt with this bill in 1965 will remember
that the purpose of the bill at the beginning
was merely to entice members of the Senate
to resign when they reached the age of 75.
That was all there was to it. There was no
contribution. The 6 per cent levy was added
at the suggestion of one whom we can easily
identify, and who was a great friend of the
Senate. But the bill was accepted without
examining sufficiently the consequences. Now,
we know that since 1965 many members of
this House have died, leaving widows without
pensions. No pensions are payable or have
been paid to the widows and no refunds have
been made to the estates.
This bill at least corrects the situation to
the following extent. As far as those senators
who have not yet reached the age of 75 are
concerned, it gives them the option within

after approximately 18 years the survivor
benefit would be $4,000. It creeps up from

what I have just said.

that long? That will be 17 years-five years
plus 12.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: It is only to add a few
dollars to a pension which, under the present
rate of indemnity is very low, $2,667.
By the way, when you compare this pension of $2,667 for a widow of a senator
appointed before 1965 to any pension payable
to the widow of a public servant or a judge,
for instance, it is a rather pitiful benefit.
Hon. Mr. Bourget: You are quite right.

March 24, 1970

Hon. Mr. Flynn: This is the same principle,
I suggest, that operates in respect of any pension. Pension contributions have always been
compulsory, and if no benefit is payable,
there is a refund. This is normally the principle of any pension scheme. I can understand
that there could be an option not to contribute, but that is very seldom the case in a
pension scheme applicable to a group. It is
certainly not the case in so far as the Public
Service is concerned. Nobody can opt out of
the pension arrangements for the Public
Service.
Therefore, if my interpretation of clause
17(1), which is concurred in by Senator Connolly, is correct, at least the contributions
paid by a senator or a person who has
resigned will be refunded if there is no benefit
payable to a widow or a retiring senator. This
is only fair.
I must say that I would have liked something to be done for those of our colleagues
who have died since 1965. I would have welcomed an amendment to provide that in all
cases where a senator died in office before the
coming into force of this act his contributions
would be refunded to his estate. That would
have been equitable, but apparently the
suggestion was made too late and nothing can
be donc at this time. However, I would urge
the honourable Leader of the Government to
deal with this problem on the first occasion
possible. I know of widows of former colleagues who really are in need of even the
small amount that is represented by a refund
of the contributions made during three, four,
or five years.

THE ESTIMATES
REPORT OF NATIONAL FINANCE COMMITTEE
ON SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES (B)
ADOPTED
The Senate proceeded to consideration of
the report of the Standing Senate Committee
on National Finance, which was authorized to
examine and report upon the expenditures as
set out in the Supplementary Estimates (B)
laid before Parliament for the fiscal year
ending March 31, 1970.
Hon. T. D'Arcy Leonard moved that the
report be adopted.
He said: Honourable senators, the report is
printed in the Senate Hansard of yesterday at
pages 760 and 761. It deals with the Supplementary Estimates (B) for the fiscal year
1969-70 which were referred to the Standing
Senate Committee on National Finance. These
supplementary Estimates cover expenditures
of approximately $215 million, and Loans,
Investments and Advances of some $41 million. In previous years we had a number of
supplementary Estimates, which in aggregate
amounted to a fairly substantial sum. However, this bas been criticized from time to
time both in your committee and elsewhere.
The result is that we have had this year only
two supplementary Estimates. We must
always have at least one supplementary Estimate, because it is not possible to see a year
ahead all the emergent situations that may
arise and require additional expenditure. We
should recognize that there is a trend now
towards decreasing the number of supplementary Estimates and their amount. The result
is that the total of the supplementary Esti[Hon. Mr. McDonald.]

March 24, 1976

mates this year is just 2J per cent of the total
Estimates for the year. These Estimates bring
the total expenditures for the year to $12,140
million and the total of Loans, Investments
and Advances to $676,032,000.
Your committee has been concerned in the
past to compare the trend of Government
expenditures with the increase in gross
national production. It is obvious that as we
grow wealthier and our production increases
our expenditures are also going to increase.
However, there is a broad, rough guideline
that may be used in this type of study. The
increase in federal Government expenditures
can be compared from year to year with the
increase in our gross national production. Our
expenditures for the year ending March 31,
1970, one week from today, are up about 11
per cent from the expenditures in the previous fiscal year. Our gross national production,
as far as we can ascertain at the present time,
is up about 9.3 per cent. Our federal Government expenditures have again in this current,
now-ending fiscal year increased more rapidly
than the gross national production of the
country. This is a warning sign that has been
needed to some extent by the Government
in announcing during the year what has been
called its austerity program.
The Estimates again include the $1 items to
which reference has been made. There are 30
such items. It is the custom of your committee
to scrutinize every one of them very carefully. There are some, of course, to which no
objection can be taken. There are others that
are really a tidying up of administration,
involving no actual expenditure and simply
changing certain purposes of expenditure
within a vote. The ones to which your committee directs its most careful attention are
legislative in character. Of the 30 $1 items in
the Supplementary Estimates (B), eight are
legislative in character.
Your committee in its report voices its
criticism of this method of bringing about a
change in a statute or in its effect through a
$1 item in the supplementary Estimates.
There may be some that are inconsequential,
but the practice is not good. It may lead, as in
point of fact it will be found to have done in
supplementary Estimates (B), to a situation
which is considerably more serious than some
minor items.
This brings me to the largest item in the
supplementary Estimates. Before going on to
deal with that, I should like to say that the
committee has recommended that where these
$1 items are used and have the effect of
changing a statute or making an exemption

March 24, 1970

SENATE DEBATES

from a statute, there should be a marginal
note when the statutes are printed to indicate
to anybody searching a statute that they
should look at these appropriation acts to
ascertain what change has been made.
I now come to the largest item in the Supplementary Estimates. Here I will read paragraph 4 of the report, because it sets out very
briefly, I think, the feeling of the committee
in dealing with this $100 million item. The
paragraph reads as follows:
The practice of amending statutes
through one-dollar items can lead to the
same practice on other items involving
substantial expenditures, thereby bringing about changes that are also legislative
in character that should properly be
brought about by substantive statutes
rather than by Appropriation Acts. Of
such a character in these Supplementary
Estimates (B) is Vote 17b of the Department of Agriculture, a grant of $100,000,000 for payments to be made in the fiscal
year 1970-71 for purposes of wheat acreage reduction, this vote being the largest
single item in the supplementary Estimates and representing nearly one-half of
the total amount of the Estimates.
It is the first vote in the Estimates.
Your committee is not critical of the purpose for which this sum is to be used, nor
of the amount of the vote, but it is
strongly of the view that the importance
of the subject matter and the extent of
the changes intended to be brought about
in so essential a part of the Canadian
economy as is constituted by our wheat
producers, require the usual and proper
method for Parliamentary action, namely,
a substantive bill with all the appropriate
clauses setting out the intended purposes
of the legislation and going through the
required readings and debates as prescribed by the Rules of the respective
Houses of Parliament. Furthermore,
while the Vote is included in the supplementary Estimates for the fiscal year
1969-70, the committee points out that the
expenditures to the producers will be
incurred in the 1970-71 fiscal year, and
subsequently, and this again is a practice
of doubtful propriety in the opinion of
your committee.
This is a subject related to the speech
Senator Argue made last week in which he
referred to the wheat acreage reduction plan
and the delegation of authority under the

Canadian Wheat Board Act. This Appropriation Act really goes one step further.
When we come to the Appropriation Act
based on these Estimates, it will be the only
statutory authority for the new program and
the new plan and the expenditure of $100
million. So, you will go from the Appropriation Act to the Supplementary Estimates,
where in one paragraph is set out what the
program is, and then you will go on to the
Canadian Wheat Board Act to see what the
powers of the Board are under its regulations.
This is a process of legislation through the
Appropriation Act and through the Supplementary Estimates to which your committee
takes objection. Speaking personally, while I
agree with the wheat acreage reduction program and believe it is desirable to spend this
substantial sum of money to encourage the
reduction in acreage of sown wheat this
year, I deplore the method of procedure. To
me it smacks too much of government by
decree.
Having said that, I commend the report to
honourable senators and move its adoption.
Hon. Hazen Argue: Honourable senators, I
am pleased that the Standing Senate Committee on National Finance, in the report just
moved by Senator Leonard, has drawn attention to what is considered to be a bad practice in using items in the Estimates to do
what in fact legislation should do. The other
night when I was speaking on this subject I
said that in my view, particularly as it related to the Canadian Wheat Board Act and the
use of permit quotas for the purpose, not of
marketing grain but of endeavouring to force
farmers to production, the whole exercise was
illegal and coercive in its application. Today I
wish to speak more on the substance of the
measure itself, what its effect has been to
date and what effect it is likely to have.
When this measure was introduced it was
said by the minister in charge that the Government hoped to spend $100 million to bring
about wheat acreage reduction, and that the
Government would be very happy indeed if
the farmers used the total maximum amount,
namely, some $142 million. This program has
been public now for a few weeks and the
reaction of the farmers is, I think, becoming
more and more clear. I venture to suggest
that only a minority of the amount of money
involved in these Estimates will be in fact
used. Here is an item that the Government is
providing to farmers, unrequested and unsolicited by them, coupled with a revolutionary
change in the government system, which I
think has already been very largely rejected.

SENATE DEBATES
The Government can take one of two views
on the great surplus of grain on the Prairies;
one is an optimistic view, the other pessimistic view. The optimistic view is that the Government should be bending every possible
effort to increase sales, markets and use of
the grain. The optimist would say that this
grain is a valuable asset; that if we should be
fortunate enough to have another good crop
this year and even add to that asset, that still
would be something of great value. The farmers who have been in the West for some
generations now say that in their experience
there are always crop failures from time to
time, both in Canada and in other countries
of the world, and that the farmers' main
problem over the years has not been burdensome surpluses but crop failures and difficulty
in producing grain. So the reaction of the
producers is immediate to this kind of program, namely, to say they would much prefer
to produce than to restrict.
I am sure that no one would have objection-and I want to make it clear that I have
no objection-to the Government, if it feels it
necessary to say to farmers, "We will give you
$6 for every acre you take out of wheat and
place into summerfallow." But I objected
before, and I object again, to saying to grain
producers, "Unless you take land out of
wheat production, unless you summerfallow,
you will have no quota and you will be
unable to deliver from the surplus of grain
you have on hand."
Hon. Mr. Martin: May I ask Senator Argue
if that provision had not been provided would
we not have contributed to a surplus situation
with regard to other products?
Hon. Mr. Argue: I want to get the question
clear. You mean the $6 an acre or the
"coercives", as I call them, in the provision?
Hon. Mr. Martin: If we had not provided
for the summerfallow or perennial forage
conditions, we would have encouraged production in other areas, including rapeseed, to
go far beyond the market requirements.
Hon. Mr. Argue: This is the theory, and I
think it is a mistaken one because what the
Government says to me as an individual producer or to any producer this year is, "If you
seed wheat, you will get no quota to sell it,
but if you seed flax and rapeseed there will
be a quota."
There is nothing more effective the Government could have donc to bring about a tremendous surplus of flax and rapeseed than the

[Hon.

Mr. Argue.]

March 24, 1970

kind of policy now outlined. I have studied its
application and I have talked to farmers.
There is every indication to me that the monstrous wheat reduction plan called "Operation
Lift" is not getting off the ground, and it
looks like a bust before takeoff.
There is a report in today's paper regarding
the D.B.S. which I believe to be factual, that
before the farmers knew of this plan at ail,
they were prepared by their own voluntary
decision to reduce their acreage this year by
over 26 per cent without coercive quotas and
without any action by the Government. A
year ago the wheat producers reduced their
acreage by 15 per cent. The farmers, by
their own intentions and actions, have been
prepared to reduce their acreage within a
two-year period by 40 per cent, without
someone telling them that if they produce
wheat this year they will not get a quota.
I say in ail sincerity that the farmers are
not going to be foolish enough to forego the
possibility, in that generally dry country, of
harvesting a crop this coming year in
exchange for $6 per acre pay, and the prospect of selling more of the wheat that they
are lucky enough to have in their bins.
I suggest that the architects of this program
have goofed, and I am going to relate some
further evidence to substantiate that. I have
already argued that this program is both illegal and coercive. The Honourable Otto Lang
has worked hard to present a program that
would bring production and demand of wheat
more nearly in line. That is the objective of
the program and I too with the Honourable
Mr. Lang want to see production, marketing
and demand brought into balance. I would
like to see a boost given to encouraging
demand rather than this means of attempting
to discourage production.
This programa is the work of a small group of
bureaucrats and I suggest their advice over the
years very often has been faulty. The farmers
have read their advice and often around
the hot stove in the winter they say that if
they do the opposite to what the bureaucrats
advise them to do it is usually for the best.
They feel that in operating their own business they have been successful and have produced greatly.
One time the farmers are told that if they
produce wheat, it will be sold, and the next
time a task force will say that of the 30
million acres in wheat it will be necessary to
reduce it to 20 million acres. This is what the
task force recommended after a lengthy
inquiry. The farmers are now planting to 18
million acres without coercion, and they say

March 24, 1970

SENATE DEBATES

that the program hatched by the bureaucrats
is based on a foolish, undemocratic and
unreal notion that bureaucrats and grain
company presidents, meeting in secret, know
more about what is good for farmers than
farmers know theiselves. Literally nobody,
just nobody, thought to ask the farmers their
opinion of this monstrosity before it was
unfurled. They called in the grain presidents
and had a few secret meetings. They also
called in the bureaucrats, the boys with the
academic degrees. The bureaucrats said that
this is good for the producers, and after the
announcement they then asked the farmers
what they thought about it.
I made twelve phone calls myself. Ten
farmers said that they did not like it and
would not follow it, that the Government was
trying to get them to forego a good crop for
$6 an acre. The next two fellows said that it
was not too bad, that they cannot kick too
much because they were seeding 200 acres of
forage crop this year, which they were going
to seed anyway, and now the Government
would be paying them $10 an acre. They are
hardly complaining about receiving $2,000 for
a practice they would have followed in any
event.
The farmers are beginning to speak and
their voices are loud and clear, "No dice"--a
flat rejection.
The policy is designed to reduce wheat
acreage by providing that the sale of wheat
will be produced entirely on the farmers'
"black land" in 1970. To sell wheat, one must
not grow wheat. What an absurdity!
I would suggest to the minister and to the
Government that before they concoct any
other kind of program to deal with the situation on the Prairies they should speak to
some farmers. They should call in some rank
and file farmers. They don't have to meet the
entire 188,000. If they ask these farmers for
their views they will get the facts. They will
get the farniers' reactions and they will be in
a much better position to know what to do.
The minister has decided to follow the advice
given in secret by some of the big grain company presidents, and I suggest that they,
themselves, have made a mistake. I also suggest that their own farmer members will not
follow them, and that the farmers themselves
will be rejecting this program.
Why are they rejecting it? The producers
with whom I spoke had rejected it for some
of the following reasons: one, it is a coercion-the big stick method, and they resent
its provisions; two, the producers are angry
21498-50

that such a policy could have been adopted
without public discussion or any prior discussion with them; three, the producers say the
Government is trying to get them to stop
growing wheat by a payment of only 20 cents
per bushel. They say the Government is
attempting to deny them an income of $30 to
$40 an acre with a payment of only $6 per
acre. The big stick is in the provision, and the
Government, the powers that be, I suggest are
relying on the big stick, the coercive part of
the Wheat Board Act, rather than the $6,
which is merely a bit of coating to make
something that is unpalatable perhaps a little
less so.
Producers say a farmer would have to have
rocks in his head to go along with this deal.
Some producers have put it another way. I
have on my desk some of these submissions
that have come from farmers. "By payment
of $100 million, coupled with the new coercive quota system, the Government would
deny us a $600 million crop." Producers
oppose this policy, since they believe it will
damage the whole prairie economy. It will
curtail farm machinery and repair parts purchases. It will hurt local dealers and merchants. It will further sap the economic vitality of already sick prairie communities.
Producers oppose this policy because the>
believe it is misguided. Instead of being used
to curtail production, $100 million could have
been used to much better advantage in promoting sales of wheat, oats, barley, flax and
rapeseed, in enlarging, servicing and retaining
markets for these grains.
This money could have been used to develop large export markets for Canadian pork
and beef, market possibilities that have scarcely been touched.
This money could have been used to develop Canadian consumption of products from
countries willing to buy vastly larger quantities of Canadian grain. There are countries
that will buy more from us if we buy even
just a moderate quantity of products from
them.
World protein demand-and I think this is
the key-is very rapidly increasing. As standards of living of people around the world go
up, they demand a higher protein content in
their diet. They are developing a market for
high protein grain and for meat and meat
products. This is where the emphasis should
be.
Producers oppose this policy because they
feel it is bad business for them individually,
and bad business for Canada, and this rejection is becoming crystal clear. It was not done

SENATE DEBATES
in the past, but I think that now there should
be a committee on market expansion to deal
with the whole question of markets for
agricultural products, to deal with the whole
question of an improved program, a better
program, in the years ahead.
When we are discussing something that is
to affect 188,000 farmers, surely we should be
asking the farmers themselves and not
saying: "We are concocting something for you
in a secret ivory tower. Some day we are
going to disclose it and if you will be a good
boy and read the fine print and follow our
advice, you will wind up on the correct side
of your business ledger."
There is a grain marketing firm in western
Canada, which I would think is the oldest and
I believe one of the most prominent grain
handling firms-that of James Richardson
and Sons Limited of Winnipeg. They put out
a weekly grain letter. Senator Paterson knows
this letter. He knows this business and he can
tell me if lie thinks what I quote is on the
right track.
This letter is dated March 19, 1970. I am
not going to read it but will refer to some
parts of it. First of all, about the surplus
problem, it says:
There are currently 415 million bushels
of wheat in commercial storage in
Canada and presumably about one billion
bushels stored on farms, but the latter
figure is questioned by many in the trade
as the amount of wheat fed to livestock
the last year or so is open to question and
some well-posted people believe that
stocks on hand are a lot less than is
generally thought.

March 24, 1970

because of drought or hail or because wild life
got the crop, or for any other number of
reasons, frost or anything else, these people
would have to seed a crop this year.
Still there is a penalty and the penalty is
that for every acre they seed, in order to get
an income for their families, they lose
income. They lose the opportunity to sell any
grain from that acreage. Therefore, I think
the officials are wrong in their quota
recommendations.
The James Richardson grain letter goes on
to say:
Be that as it may, we do know that many
farmers in the high protein growing areas
in the western third of the Palliser Triangle have not got burdensome stocks on
hand and if they get out of prdouction and
the protein grading system comes into
effectAnd this will come into effect because it bas
been placed before Parliamentthere could be a few red faces around
next fall when it comes to meeting
export demand in certain areas of the
world.
In other words, once again the ivory tower
bureaucrats could be wrong. Instead of
having a surplus of high protein wheat, we
could easily have a deficit of high protein
wheat. The bureaucrats have been there for
20 years, and some of us for 20 years have
been advocating the protein grading of wheat.
After the country has lost markets for tens
of millions of bushels of wheat, they come
into Parliament in 1970 and say, "We have
thought it over. Give us a high protein grade
and we will start a new system." The Americans have been beating us for almost a generation by the use of protein grading.
I think the farmers may well be right this
fall, because they are going to seed their
crops as the land requires, as nature would
suggest. They may well have a good crop of
high protein wheat, and when the wheat and
markets are there the farmers will be ready
to fill the demands of the market.
This letter continues:
Australia harvested a much smaller crop
than last year and sales are going well so
far. Their surplus is being reduced by a
plague of rodents, which is a pretty
sneaky way of doing things.

My own personal observation is that there is
a large number of farmers who, even with
the very small quotas, will be out of wheat
this coming summer. The surplus is not
nearly as big, in my judgment, as some of the
officials think and as some of the official statistics show.
Those individual farmers who know that
they are going to be out of wheat in July
have to seed wheat this spring. They are going
to seed wheat and they should seed wheat.
They are not going to use a double summer
fallow. I have never seen an acre of double
summer fallow in my life, and I do not think
I ever will. If one summers it for two years in
a row, it will blow away and it will produce
no crop. The farmers I mention will seed
wheat, but, when they seed, their marketing They are losing the crop at home because of
quota is reduced for every acre they put in rodents, but they are making great sales and
the ground. Say they had no crop last year going very well.
[Hon. Mr. Argue.]

March 24, 1970

SENATE DEBATES

In regard to the Argentine:
The last Argentina government estimate
of their wheat crop is 250 million bushels,
which is just about enough to look after
their own requirements plus commitments to Latin neighbours.
So the Argentine, according to the James
Richardson letter, will not be a serious competitor for us this year.
Then there is an important reference to the
United States. When Canada unveiled its
policy, the first and the most favourable comment I read was from the United States
Secretary of Agriculture. He said, "The
Canadians are doing a wonderful thing; they
are cutting back their production." Might not
he say that. The Americans have moved in
and taken over a large part of our traditional
markets, and our answer to them is, "We are
sorry we have a surplus. We will reduce our
acreage in 1970." But not the Americans. The
grain letter refers to this:
It is rather interesting to note that,
while our spring wheat acreage intentions
show a sharp decrease, the United States
spring plantings are expected to be up by
10 per cent.
I feel that we can support an item of payment to farmers if the payment is based upon
a voluntary decision of the farmers and if
they were given the opportunity to operate
their farms now as they were during the war,
under the late Right Honourable J. G. Gardiner, when he dealt with what was considered to be a difficult situation and brought in
acreage payments. Then the farmers were
free to decide for themselves whether or not
they wished to reduce wheat acreage, increase
summer fallow, and collect the payments.
I feel that the Government now would be
far better to take a reassessment of the situation, and such would be my advice. They
should say to the producers of western
Canada, "Here is the $6 an acre. We thought
you were going to cost us $100 million by
doing it our way, but we think now that you
are not going to cost us that much because
fundamentally, you don't really agree with
the policy, and you will use only a minority
of the money involved." And they should say
to the farmers, "We withdraw any intention
to change the quota system on western grain.
We will not base wheat marketings on black
sterile summerfallow acreage, but rather we
will return to the specified acreage system for
the 1970-71 crop year or some accepted
modification of that system."
21498-501

If the Government did that, it would get
itself off the hook and be able to divorce
itself from the grain company presidents and
others who gave the Government this bad
advice. The Government is in the position
today where its allies are some of the leaders
of the grain marketing system, but the farmers are not with them.
Hon. Mr. Martin: And the farm leaders.
Hon. Mr. Argue: The leaders of only some
of these organizations.
Hon. Mr. Martin: And the premiers of the
three western provinces.
Hon. Mr. Argue: Well, this I do not know. I
heard an inside story about what was said to
Premier Thatcher before he made his public
statement. I may not refer to it because it is
only hearsay, but I say that in political life
hearsay, when it is checked further, is often
found to be close to the truth. At any rate,
not all the farm leaders have gone along with
this. The National Farm Union has not gone
along with it.
As the Government leader says-and I do
not hesitate to say it as I read it-the minister here in secret discussion was supported by
the presidents of these grain organizations,
some of whom operate grain organizations
owned by producers and have a kind of
double role. They are heads of the grain companies and are farm leaders, as my leader in
the Senate suggests. But I suggest that, far
better than having support from so-called farm
leaders, grain company presidents who are
out of touch, the Government would be better
off to have the support of the producers
themselves. I would suggest that if a poll
were taken the Government would find that
the producers are not in favour of this program and resent very much being traded off
by anybody in a secret meeting.
The Government should withdraw these
coercive provisions which were not in the
Wheat Board Act in the first place and which
will serve only to destroy the goodwill created by the Wheat Board in western Canada,
since they are contrary to the principle of the
Canadian Wheat Board Act. If they make the
whole scheme a voluntary one the farmers
will take up the $6 an acre offer and fit some
wheat reduction into their farm practice and
still keep on producing a variety of crops.
Moreover, if we promote the kind of market
development I suggest, the farmers this year,
next year and in the years ahead will in fact
sell that production.

SENATE DEBATES
Hon. David A. Croll: Honourable senators,
this afternoon the Senate is in character.
Senator Argue has spoken on wheat and I
will speak about unemployment. The Government will not derive much comfort from
either of our speeches.
In drafting a resolution for a full-scale
debate on unemployment I had thought to
wait until our return from our short recess
before seeking an opportunity to express
myself on the subject. But on seeing the supplementary Estimates I realized that here was
an opportunity even now to say something
which might be useful.
Many of you will have noticed, increasingly
from day to day, the long line-ups in front of
the unemployment offices. The jobless are
commencing to sit in. They did at the provincial parliament in Toronto and they will soon
appear on Parliament Hill here in Ottawa.
The suddenness and extent of unemployment has brought tragedy to our land. It is
the highest since 1964. There are over half a
million people unemployed-6.5 per cent. That
is the highest percentage of unemployment in
six years. It is the highest that almost any
developed country tolerates.
I have here the figures from 1964 to 1968
for inflation and unemployment. The following countries,
Japan, the Netherlands,
Sweden, Germany, Switzerland, Britain and
Belgium, all have a greater amount of inflation than we have in Canada, but all have
less unemployment on a percentage basis.
Hon. Mr. Martin: It is on a different basis.
Hon. Mr. Croll: No, the basis is the same.
Of course, the minute you hand out figures
someone objects. But these are not Senator
Martin's figures; these figures come from the
International Labour Office and they measure
them in the very same way in all the
circumstances.
Hon. Mr. Martin: They are from eight
months ago.
Hon. Mr. Croll: I said 1964 to 1968. Since
then it has become worse in Canada so that
there is no use talking about eight months
ago. In any event, here they are, and I refer
to only two countries, Canada and the United
States. In Canada the figure for inflation is 3.1
and the figure for unemployment is 4.2; in the
United States the figure for inflation is 2.5
and for unemployment 4.4.
You have to ask yourself why others are so
much more able to deal with matters of such
great importance as unemployment. Are there
[Hon. Mr. Argue.]

March 24, 1970

different values there? Have these other
countries social values that we do not
possess?
Sometimes I wonder if some of our people
who make junkets to various countries could
take a working junket and find out exactly
what is happening in other parts of the world
and how they do things there.
Unemployment like poverty "ain't what it
used to be," and neither of them will be
tolerated any longer in this country.
Let me just indicate to you the concept. We
used to think of poverty in terms of destitution and privation. Well, today, we talk of
crisis poverty, desperation area poverty,
inherited poverty, cultural poverty and hardcore poverty, but it does not make any difference what you call it. We define it as the lack
of access to goods, services and conditions
available to everyone else that is normal in
that environment. If you want another definition, it has been worked out very carefully by
the Economic Council and our own Canadian
Bureau of Statistics. It is accepted that a
person may spend 50 per cent of his income
for food, clothing and shelter. But when he
spends more than 70 per cent, he is in a
condition of poverty. Honourable senators,
you do not have to define it for him; he
knows all about it at that stage. That is the
definition accepted in this country.
Things have changed as far as unemployment is concerned. We now have unemployment insurance and transitional assistance for
the automobile people as a result of the
agreement, along with fringe benefits, job
seniority and other provisions to alleviate
conditions. But there is no substitute for a
job. The hurt of being jobless is very painful.
I believe that the Government in making its
choice has chosen the certain evil of high
unemployment, and consequently a large gap
between the actual and potential output as
against the uncertain evil of moderately high
inflation. I think it bas been given that advice
by some of these ex officio intellectuals, these
people who have skipped grades, who ignore
the values of policies and politics, how it
really is, how it was and what it really
means. Inflation bas a price on it, a monetary
price predominantly. Unemployment has a
price and it exacts a monetary price. But it
also has a social price, human dignity, selfesteem and hope. It is another very potent
argument for a guaranteed maintenance
income, which I think is an important contribution to social justice. That is one way to
make the Government aware of the consequences of unemployment, since it would

March 24, 1970

SENATE DEBATES

have to foot the bill resulting from the need
for income maintenance due to unemployment. We find ourselves today in a situation
where questions are being asked and we can
no longer ignore them. Today we are asked
for an answer, tomorrow they will demand an
answer. We in the Senate have lately become
more closely involved in the lives of people. I
notice from Hansard of March 19 that the
Prime Minister has this to say:
-The parliamentary system has reverted to the role of the Senate as being a
chamber where members apply their
wisdom, their devotion and their knowledge to an exhaustive review of decisions
which are also considered in another
Chamber.
Very nice. I am glad to know we have some
friends and particularly in high places. We
also have other people who think well of us.
Let me give you two typical cases and indicate to you what is happening in this land.
The first is a man in his thirties, working in
service or in industry, who has always been
employed. He is married, has a young family,
a home, a mortgage, and some accessories. He
has a car, a television set and some little
insurance. And he has wall-to-wall debts. He
has very little reserves. He has never been
out of work in his life except for a few days
because of illness. Then suddenly he is permanently laid off. What an emotional shock,
what an economic catastrophe and what a
shattering experience it is for him. A little of
the world has fallen in on him. In conversation be is heard to say, "You know, Grandpa
used to talk about a depression, but he was
an old man and was probably exaggerating."
Then his wife reminds him, "Well, Dad said
something about unemployment at various
times," and the young man replies, "Yes, but
those were different times." I ask you, honourable senators, were they different? Are
they different, and, if so, how different?
Let us take another case which is also typical. This man is in his forties, again working
either in industry or service, married, with
his family starting to grow up. He has a
house and has paid off the mortgage; he has
a car and a television set and some accessories, a few bonds and some insurance. He bas
many problems and the children are ready to
go to college. He has banked on his ability to
improve their way of life. He has a few
reserves and from time to time has
experienced what it is like to be laid off. But
now suddenly he is permanently laid off.
There are great strains on the family, with

the uncertainty, the fear and the frustration. I
ask you where is a man who is over forty
going to look for a new job in this day and
age?
There is something else that is cropping up
in the household. Children are saying now to
their parents, "Well, we told you that the
system won't work, that its values are phony
and that you don't count." They are repeating
what they hear on the streets. They say,
"Dad, your generation can only make war; it
can't make peace and provide jobs at the
same time."
How do you advise these people? They will
speak to you as they do to me. Do you advise
them to enter the welfare web? I would not
under any circumstances. Do you advise them
to enter the manpower stream where they
could get retraining, rehabilitation, fit themselves for the technological needs of the
future? Do you tell them hopefully that
unemployment insurance may be extended,
that coverage will be wider, that benefits may
be better, and that we will pay a weekly
three-quarters of the average industrial wage
instead of two-thirds? Maybe it will even
cover all employed people, but for the time
being $53 is al that they can get for a specified period of time. Could we say to them,
"Look, if unemployment persists the Government will become the employer of last
resort"? Or do we say, "Well, it is going to
blow over soon but in the meantime tighten
your belt, leave a few extra holes in case
there is some more tightening of belts necessary"? On the other hand, should we tell
them that they ought to feel honoured to
make the great sacrifice in the national
interest?
We are fighting inflation on a national
scale. The economists, sociologists and
theoreticians, all these people who know these
things so well, who speak not of unemployment but of "unused capacity", they are now
manufacturing titles such as, "Soldiers in the
war against inflation." Well, we have to
remember that we got ourselves into this jam.
The unemployed have had little or nothing to
do with it. Full employment in itself is not
inflationary; it is greed and avarice that make
it so. The wrong people are being made to
pay the price of others' mistakes.
I know there are those who think it is a
great achievement to find we have a monetary surplus, but I did not see any dancing in
the streets when that was announced. This
country cannot afford to dissipate its human
resources in idleness. We cannot afford the

SENATE DEBATES

amount of unemployment we have at the present time. We cannot afford to let it go on for
any length of time. There is a militancy in
this country: you can feel it in the air; you
can read about it; you can see it. Unemployment will not be helpful to good government
or tranquility for our country. I think the
time has come for the Government to change
its course, to take another hard look and realize that, sure, there is a price for inflation,
but the price of unemployment is far more
costly. We are less likely to be able to face
up to it and have peace in this country.
Hon. Jacques Flynn: Honourable senators, I
have only a few brief comments.
Firstly, I would say that I was very pleased
to listen to the speech of the honourable senator who has just resumed his seat. He is now
speaking the saine language as this party has
spoken recently, and we appreciate and welcome converts. It may help us to convince the
Government that its present policy with
regard to inflation is not entirely safe, that we
may be paying much too dearly in increasing
unemployment, only for the sake of trying to
save a few dollars here or there in the Estimates, and be restricting the economic expansion of Canada.
Secondly, I would commend the Standing
Senate Committee on National Finance for its
continuing excellent work under the chairmanship of Senator Leonard.

March 24, 1970

incidental problems like the one I referred to
when dealing with Bill C-194; but otherwise, I
am in perfect agreement with what he has
said here. It is so obvious in the case raised
by Senator Argue. I think his speech this
afternoon showed that there is no doubt that
Parliament would have been in a much better
position to examine and deal with this matter
had it come to us in the form of a bill.
Therefore, I hope that the Government will
give this recommendation of the committee
serious consideration.
The last comment I wish to make is on the
last sentence in the same paragraph of the
report, which reads:
Furthermore, while the VoteThe same vote that Senator Argue spoke

committee points out that the expenditures to the producers will be incurred in
the 1970-71 fiscal year, and subsequently,
and this again is a practice of doubtful
propriety in the opinion of your
committee.

In committee I think I raised the point
myself. This item is for about $100 million,
and the Minister of Finance indicated in his
budget speech, or perhaps on another occasion, that he had anticipated a surplus of $450
million for the year ending March 31, 1970,
but that because of this item of $100 million

not our most serious, is inflation? If we do not
act to curb it we create a problem not only
for those who have great resources, but for
those who work in the factories, the working
group, as well as for other groups in the
community. The Government said yesterday
through the Prime Minister, and I repeat his
argument, that we feel we have a responsibility to fight inflation. We are doing it in the
way that we believe to be best. If you have a
better method, tell us. We are acting on the
advice of the Governor of the Bank of
Canada, the Economic Council and those who
by training and otherwise feel that this is the
only course that can be taken short of controls. It is a course which has been followed
in the United States and much more seriously
and severely in the United Kingdom. The
Prime Minister said yesterday "What do you
suggest we should do? Have you any other
suggestion than the course we are now
embarked on?"
We are retrenching, cutting down and
urging municipal and provincial governments
to reduce their expenditures. As a result of
Ithis we are able to produce a surplus this
year. This is not to say we gloat in that in the
light of the fact there are people out of work,
but it does serve as a demonstration of the
effectiveness of our retrenchment program,
which is anti-inflation based. What solution
do you offer? Are we to do nothing? If as a
result of this program of curtailment there is
a cut in production which results in unemployment, that is regrettable, but what other
course can you suggest?
"We are aware of the danger of an overkill", said the Prime Minister. The Government is aware of this. It is very difficult, of
course, to say where the line exists.
There is one other solution which the
Prime Minister mentioned yesterday to the
Canadian Labour Congress. That is an overall
system of controls of wages, profits, rents, and
so on. The Prime Minister asked what are the
consequences of that type of control. Are you
advocating that and asking this Government
to bring in a system of controls of that
dimension? He said, "If you are, then I must
frankly tell you that I am not prepared to be
the head of a government that will do so,
because that can only be done under a different system of government and a different
form of society." These are the arguments
that have to be faced.
When Senator Croll says that we have
unemployment, I recognize his right and duty
to point this out, but he also has an obligation
to offer an alternative, to off er a solution. I
believe the only answer I can make in the

absence of being offered a solution is to say
that the Government is deeply aware of the
seriousness of the situation, is doing everything that it can, and has urged the Economic
Coundil of Canada to urge restraints on business so that profits and prices will be kept in
curb for a period. We hoped to get a positive
response yesterday from the leaders of the
Canadian Congress of Labour and the
C.N.T.U., but this was not forthcoming. The
Government has therefore, in the face of that
reluctance to meet the situation, to do its best
to deal with this very serious problem.
The Leader of the Opposition (Hon.
Mr. Flynn) confirmed what the committee
said about paragraph 4 of the report, and I
have dealt with that. I simply want to add
that in taking the position that I felt the $100
million item had to be dealt with in the way
it was, I do not want that assertion to be
construed as meaning the suggestion of the
committee is not valid. I believe the committee has served a purpose in recalling to senators, Parliament and the Government, the
desirability under our parliamentary system
of proceeding by way of the prescribed form
of statute.
Hon. Mr. Leonard: Honourable senatorsThe Hon. the Speaker: I must inform
honourable senators that if the honourable
Senator Leonard speaks now his speech will
have the effect of closing the debate.
Hon. Mr. Leonard: Honourable senators, all
I wish to do is to acknowledge the very interesting speeches we have had from Senators
Argue and Croll, and the Leader of the Opposition (Hon. Mr. Flynn) and the Leader
of the Senate (Hon. Mr. Martin). I am
very happy that this report has provoked
such an intersting and informative debate,
and I now move the adoption of the report.

CANADA-UNITED STATES INTERPARLIAMENTARY GROUP
THIRTEENTH ANNUAL MEETINGDEBATE ADJOURNED

Leave having been given to revert to
Inquiry No. 9:
Hon. Lazarus Phillips rose pursuant to
notice:
That he will call the attention of the
Senate to the Thirteenth Meeting of the
Canada-United States Interparliamentary
Group held at Washington, Cape Kennedy, Houston and San Antonio, 10th to
15th March, 1970.

SENATE DEBATES
He said: Honourable senators, the hour
being somewhat late I shall try to be as succinct as I can under the circumstances.
The subject I will be dealing with is the
13th Meeting of the Canada-United States
Interparliamentary Group, held in Washington and other places referred to in the resolution. It was not my intention to give full
details of what took place at this series of
interparliamentary meetings, because the
Speaker of the Senate will himself deal with
the subject in due course, and will give a full
and detailed survey of the various meetings,
as well as the social events that took place.
Indeed, I was the junior senator on the delegation, and it is my intention today to deal
with only two or three basic aspects of the
report.
We arrived in Washington on the day
immediately following the announcement of
President Nixon involving restrictions on the
importation of oil into the United States from
Canada. At the important social event that
took place before our detailed committee
meetings I was given the honour of speaking
on behalf of the Senate in reply to the American speakers, and I then referred to the restrictions that had been put on oil importation.
I stated that all the Canadian senators and
commoners had been given their allotment of
oil from Canada to take down to Washington
in order that we may pour oil on the troubled
waters in dealing with the subject matter of
the sovereignty of the Arctic, integration of
power resources, NATO and other items that
clearly would be the subject of discussion, but
that when we reached the border the American customs officers had taken the oil away
from us on account of President Nixon's
announcement the day before. Under the circumstances, I therefore advised my American
listeners particularly that they should expect
in the discussion the following day that some
of the observations made by us, because of
our lack of oil, might be critical and somewhat abrasive.
I should point out that the Canadian delegation divided itself into two groups. One
group dealt with Canadian defence and Arctic
sovereignty. I was not a member of that committee, and I have reason to believe that
Senator O'Leary will probably deal with that
matter when he addresses you. I joined the
group of senators dealing with economic and
trade matters. We had the great honour that
our Speaker headed the delegation, not only of
senators but also of commoners dealing with
that matter when when we sat down to work
[Hon. Mr. Phillips

(Rigaud).]

March 24, 1970

for a full day's discussion with representatives of the American Senate and the American House of Representatives.
In these discussions we dealt mainly with
restrictions on oil importations, integration of
a continental energy policy, pollution, inflation and the automotive pact. With regard to
the automotive pact, I should like to pay my
respects to and compliment Senator Willis for
a very fine contribution to the discussions
that took place in committee. We also dealt at
some length with pollution and the necessity
for very close co-operation between the two
governments on this important and serious
matter. My understanding is that on the subjects of a continental energy policy, inflation,
the automotive pact, and so on, we will be
hearing from honourable senators who took
part in the deliberations at that time. I will
therefore confine myself today to the very
slight contribution I made in committee in
dealing more specifically with the subject
matter of the balance of payments between
our two countries and, in relationship thereto,
the very relevant question of the high amount
of United States investment in our country.
I pointed out to our American friends that
the United States of America was really a
fortunate country in the nineteenth century,
the reason being that in the nineteenth century it was more fashionable and considered
to be a more conventional way for an investor to buy bonds. The United Kingdom investor was a main creditor in the development of
America in the nineteenth century. It bought
bonds, and in the course of time these bonds
were amortized and hence repaid, and in the
result the people of the U.S.A. remained in
control of the equity position of the basic
economic resources of their own country. I
pointed out to the American senators and the
American members of the House of Representatives that we in Canada were not quite so
fortunate in this respect in the twentieth century, because it has become fashionable for
investors to buy equity stock. When an investor buys equity stock you become more or
less subject, by way of perpetual economic
servitude, to the person who owns the equity
stock, because there is no way in which you
can force the owner of the equity stock to sell
it unless you proceed on a totalitarian basis,
which we in Canada do not propose to do.
I therefore pointed out to them that we in
Canada were in a very unfortunate position,
that as much as we liked American investment and their money coming into this country, which we appreciated in order to help us
in the development of our country, we found

Marth 24, 1970

SENATE DEBATES

ourselves in a position that we could not
retrieve the control of our economic destiny
in the saine way as the United States had
done through the latter part of the nineteenth
century or in the first two decades of the
twentieth century.
The question was then put to me, "Well,
what do you do under these circumstances,
having regard to your problem?" I then stated
to them the following propositions. I made it
clear that these suggestions on my part might
be regarded as slightly provocative or slightly
disturbing to my American listeners, and that
they represented purely and simply my personal views and certainly not the view by
way of consensus of the delegation at large,
and certainly not the view of the Government
in Canada. I suggested the following approaches with a view to retrieving a portion of
the Canadian equity now lost to the United
States investors. I suggested first that, with
respect to key major investments in Canada
existing at the present time, contact should be
established with parent organizations in the
United States in order that Canadian subsidiaries should recapitalize their structure to
create substantial funded debt and low equity
base so that Canadians will be offered, say,
one-third of such equity base at a modest
price.
Now, exactly what does that mean? On a
practical basis I pointed out that I was referring to, say, 200 key subsidiaries in Canada of
top giant American concerns. Let us assume
that the original investment in one of these
subsidiaries was $5 million, and let us assume
that there was an accumulated undistributed
surplus of another $15 million. That would be
$20 million book value. Let us also assume
that the true worth, having regard to the
ratio of earnings per share, having regard to
prospects for the future, would increase it by
another $10 million to $30 million. I suggested
that this subsidiary in Canada, having a real
worth of $30 million, should recapitalize itself
with $25 million worth of funded debt, amortized, say, over a period of 30 years and with
a remaining $5 million of equity base so that
Canadians could purchase one-third of that
equity base, that is to say one-third of $5
million. In that way, Canadians would get a
future participation in a company which
today had a worth of, say, $30 million.
I think that my American listeners were a
little disturbed at the retroactive effects of
that approach, and I made it very clear to
them that I was not in favour of statutory or
compulsory treatment. I suggested that this
could be accomplished if there was good will

on both sides of the border and if the Americans appreciated our problem and would cooperate with us with a view to bringing this
about by way of negotiation in a manner that
I will indicate later on in my remarksthrough the medium of a pilot plan operation.
My second suggestion was that in regard to
future investment, from now on there should
be a high funded debt ratio to equity and that
here again Canadians should be offered onethird of such equity base. This means that if
an American wished to come into Canada and
invest $5 million, that $4 million should be by
way of funded debt and amortized over a
long period, and there should be $1 million
worth of equity stock and, of that $1 million,
one-third should be offered to the Canadian
public. In that way we would be getting a
true participation between our American
friends who have confidence in our country
and the Canadians who would have the
opportunity to be partners with our American
investors in a telling and a serious way.
The third point I made in committee was
that I warned the American delegates that
Canada was concerned about its defence
industries and a reasonable retention of control of its natural resources, and that they
should expect in the future a Canadian
emphatic position with respect to this matter.
Some of my listeners here today were
at the committee meeting in Washington and
they will remember that by sheer coincidence
this observation preceded what transpired
subsequently in recent weeks in Canada with
respect to the Denison matter. In making the
foregoing suggestions, I did not have the time
in Washington to deal with the mechanics to
bring about the foregoing objectives.
I should say at once, before dealing with
specific mechanics, that I do not entertain the
view that every Canadian company should
have a 51 per cent Canadian equity ownership. I certainly do not accept the view
that this should be done by legislative or
governmental compulsion.
With respect to the mechanics referred to
above, and dealing with investments to date, I
think the matter could be handled by a process of persuasion and tax incentives. A pilot
plan operation could be started by contacting
major parent corporations in the United
States of America to see what could be done
with respect to wholly-owned subsidiaries in
Canada.
In connection with existing and future
investments, that is the ratio of funded debt
to equity stock, this policy should be handled

SENATE DEBATES

by direct negotiations with the parties in
interest and with the right to offer tax incentives to reach the desired objective.
The tax incentive could be by way of a
reduction of tax rates, that is to say, to wholly-owned subsidiaries who would follow the
plan I have in mind of high funded debt to
low equity base, through recapitalization of
existing companies or through high funded
debt and low equity capitalization in the
future. We might consider a variation in the
withholding
tax, drawing a distinction
between interest on funded debt and dividends on equity stock. That is to say, if there
were high funded debt and low equity stock,
and if my plan and suggestion were followed,
the Government of this country might consider even the elimination of withholding taxes
in respect to interest paid on high funded
debt, as an inducement to the American
investor to establish his high ratio of borrowed money as against equity stock.
These may appear to some of my listeners as
highly technical tax and corporate questions,
but I am perfectly convinced that if the Government of Canada were to appoint a limited
group of experts-say, two or three, not
more-and gave them the authority to talk to
the heads of the leading corporations in the
United States who have major investments in
this country, that by persuasion and tax
incentives cumulatively, we could bring about
a revolutionary and basic change in the status
of American investments in this country now
and in the future.
I am of the opinion that some of the
malaise in our national mood at the moment,
and in the resulting unrest, is due in part to a
well defined feeling that we have lost and are
continuing to lose control of our national heritage. This brings about an impairment of
pride in our country and reduces an appreciation of our rightful status as Canadians.
My views in this respect should be related
to the opinion I expressed in this chamber
when I spoke in reply to the Speech from the
Throne last autumn, that there should be a
common market between Canada and the
United States. We overlook the fact that as
one of the great trading nations of the world
we have a very limited domestic market, and
for that reason we are particularly vulnerable
in respect of our balance of payments in its
relation to foreign investment.
In this connection I should like to draw the
attention of the chamber to an article in the
Canadian Tax Journal for November and
December, 1969, Vol. XVII, No. 6. This article,
[Hon. Mr. Phillips (Rigaud).]

March 24, 1970

written by Messrs. John R. Allan and John J.
O'Callaghan, deals with the Sixth Annual
Review of The Economic Council of Canada.
On page 437, we read the following:
There is no mention in the Review of
the potential difficulties for Canada stemming from the fact that it is one of the
few advanced countries entering the
1970s without relatively free access to a
major market. Unlike the western European countries, which are provided access
to huge markets by virtue of their membership in one or other of the major trading blocks, or the United States and
Japan, each of which enjoys a very large
domestic market, Canada is dependent
upon a relatively small domestic market
and upon its ability to gain access to the
markets of other countries across their
obstructive tariff walls.
Some of the thoughts that I have expressed
here seem to be sympathetic to the Report of
the 1957 Royal Commission on Canadian Economic Prospects which was held under the
chairmanship of a distinguished Canadian,
the Honourable Walter Gordon. There was
some merit to the lyrics of Mr. Gordon'E
views, but the collaborators who provided the
music to such lyrics left much to be desired. J
should like to feel that through persuasion
and tax incentive we can bring about a repatriation of Canadian equity and the machin.
ery for participation in Canadian equity
from now on. I, for one, would hesitate to
cross into the territory of statutory or legislative compulsion.
What we seem to overlook in Canada, however, is the vital point that if we wish
Canadians to participate in equity investment,
the climate, economic, fiscal and monetary,
should be such that Canadians would have a
chance to build up their savings. This phase
is referred to in an article in the Financial
Post dated March 21, 1970, by W. A. Macdonald. I quote from this article:
This raises again the question brought up
a few years ago by former Finance Minister Mitchell Sharp and Bank of Canada
Governor Louis Rasminsky of the need
for a national savings policy to reduce
reliance on foreign borrowing. The question was never answered by subsequent
finance ministers.
Inviting Canadians to take an equity position without their having the resources would
be as realistic as watching a hockey game

March 24, 1970

SENATE DEBATES

without a puck being put into play or as
satisfying as inviting gourmets to a sumptuous
meal if all the diners were toothless.
This is not the time or the place to deal
with the White Paper. In due course you will
be receiving reports from the Standing Committee on Banking, Trade and Commerce, and
I express at the moment my own views only.
I believe that the most vital factor to consider
in the White Paper is whether it is conducive
to savings by Canadians.
In this connection I was given by my colleagues in the Standing Senate Committee on
Banking, Trade and Commerce the privilege
of leading off in the examination of our first
witness, Mr. Bryce of the Department of
Finance. Some of the questions I put to him
dealt specifically with the matter of savings.
At this stage I do not think it improper to
invite honourable senators to study the
examination of Mr. Bryce. It is very significant that today in Montreal the current
conference of the Canadian Tax Foundation
-a foundation of which I had the honour
to be President many years ago following
the late Mr. Kenneth Carter who contributed
somewhat to the philosophy of the White
Paper-considered the subject matter of savings in relation to a proper study of the White
Paper to be of paramount importance.
The reason I refer to this and why I regard
it as relevant to the subject matter of my
report of what took place in Washington is
that there is no sense in bemoaning our fate,
in dealing with the economic servitude that
we have in relation to the Americans; there is
no point in saying that we want Canadians to
invest in Canada's future; there is no relevancy in expressing these attitudes unless there
is developed a sound, constructive policy,
having regard to the complexities of our
country, regional and otherwise, pursuant to
which policies Canadians will year in and
year out be able to retain the fruits of their
labour and the fruits of their investment so
that the residual available after living
expenses and available after the payment of
taxes will be at the beck and cal of Canadians in order to make these investments to
which I refer.
I emphasize that I am not at all expressing
any views at this stage as a member of the
committee in respect of any specific suggestions related to the White Paper. This will
come later as a result of the deliberations of
the committee itself. AU I am doing is discussing that aspect of the White Paper in
relationship to the subject matter of savings,

because, in the process of either supporting or
not supporting it, not sufficient emphasis has
been laid thereon.
We have dealt this afternoon with the subject of inflation; we have dealt with the subject of foreign investments; we have dealt
with the subject matter of price and wage
stability, to which our leader referred a few
moments ago in justification of the fight
against inflation so that with price stability
those of lower brackets of income or those
who are retired will be able to buy their
services and commodities at proper prices.
Savings, honourable senators, have a vital
effect on all these items. They have a vital
effect on the three great problems in the economic sphere. Firstly, through savings we
obtain a curb on inflation because it reduces
demand for services and commodities.
Secondly, through savings we will provide the
funds for Canadian participation in Canada's
business expansion. Thirdly, through savings
we provide increased investment opportunities, and through such increased investment
there should be made available more commodities for sale. With such savings, with
increased commodities available and with
reduced demand resulting from savings, there
should be a consequential stabilization in
prices and in services.
Honourable senators, before concluding I
ask you to realize that with the short time at
my disposal, and it being the end of the afternoon, I have attempted only to cover the
high spots. I trust that I have done so with
sufficient clarity and precision as to warrant
further serious discussions as we proceed
with this debate.
In conclusion, I simply want to refer to the
basic simplicities of life which we sometimes
lose sight of as we go on, as we learn more,
as we read more books, as we listen to more
opinions. Somehow or other as we seem to
get more sophisticated we become less
rational. I owe my father and mother two
great contributions they made to me in the
fashioning of my life. One was an insistence
that I should love and fear my God with
reverential respect; the second important
message they gave me was this: "Our dear
son, make a dollar and spend $1.01 and the
consequent result is misery. Make a dollar,
our dear son, and spend 99 cents and you will
find that the result will be great happiness." I
think we in Canada in these days of tumult,
excitement, recrimination, insult and the like
should come back to an appreciation of these
two very simple rules, that is, of realizing our

790

SENATE DEBATES

responsibility to our Maker and of getting
down to earth in proceeding quietly and in
co-operation with other Canadians to produce,
and, after we produce through our efforts, to
save. I think if we do these two simple things
it will be amazing how many of our problems
wül be solved.

25 March 1970

Sir:
I have the honour to inform you that
the Right Honourable Gérald Fauteux,
P.C., Chief Justice of Canada, acting as
Deputy of His Excellency the Governor
General, will proceed to the Senate
Chamber today, March 25th, at 5.00 p.m.

certain bills.
I have the honour to be,
Sir,
Your obedient servant,
Louis-Frémont Trudeau,
Brigadier General
Assistant Secretary to
the Governor General
The Honourable
The Speaker of the Senate,
Ottawa.

It is not necessary for me to say a great
deal, having in mind that this is the last
appropriation bill for the fiscal year ending
next Tuesday, March 31. The bill is based on
Supplementary Estimates (B) which were
referred to the National Finance Committee.
As you know, that committee reported to the
Senate the day before yesterday, and the
debate on that report took place yesterday.
This bill is based precisely on those Supplementary Estimates (B).
The amount to be voted is $215,967,147
of expenditures, which is the amount that
is in the supplementary Estimates, and $41,614,752 of Loans, Investments and Advances,
making a total of $257,581.899.
The bill is in the usual form of final supply
bills. I do not know if I need add anything
further, other than to say to anyone who was
absent yesterday when the report was debated, or anyone who bas since had any questions arise in his mind, that it is quite in
order to speak in those circumstances, and
I shall do my best to answer any further
questions that arise.
Hon. Mr. Grosari: Honourable senators, I
would ask honourable Senator Leonard one
question. On an earlier occasion be said that
there might be a revision of Vote 17b, Department of Agriculture, a revision of the original

chamber as to where that revision now
appears in a public document?

appreciate the question asked by Senator
Grosart.

committee on his great accomplishment

in

SENATE DEBATES
conducting the meetings of the Finance Committee and achieving the very special results
in terms of detailed examination of the public
accounts and the Estimates. That is, I hasten
to say, not a mere pro forma compliment.
I am convinced, from some examination of
the total parliamentary process in respect of
the Estimates and the accountability of the
Government to Parliament, that Senator
Leonard personally has made a very significant contribution to the public interest in
bringing about a kind of examination which
was not taking place, and bas not taken place,
elsewhere in this Parliament. The report once
again indicates in a very brief way some of
those achievements.
The report is numbered in five paragraphs
and, accordingly, I will deal with it paragraph
by paragraph. The first paragraph merely
states that the committee bas, with respect to
the said Estimates, heard evidence from Mr.
J. L. Fry, Assistant Secretary, and Mr. Bruce
MacDonald, Director General, both from the
Treasury Board.
Senator Leonard introduced an innovation
this year relating to some problems that arose
in reconciling the Estimates with the general
views of the committee as expressed in the
past. He arranged that these two important
officials of the Treasury Board come, first of
all, before the steering committee of the
Standing Senate Committee on Finance and
then before the whole committee. In my view,
that is a very useful innovation because it
gives us an opportunity to examine officials in
detail in a way that is not always possible
in a large committee meeting. On that occasion the officials were most co-operative and
very frank and, I suggest, were in private
rather more sympathetic than officials generally are to the kind of concerns which
Members of Parliament in the other place
and here are inclined to have about the system of non-disclosing shorthand which has
developed over the years in the procedure
of translating Government decisions into
Estimates, supplementary or otherwise, and
then into acts of Parliament.
The important factor that I suggest honourable senators should keep in mind in respect of
the bill before us is that it is an act of Parliament. It does much more than merely allocate
or ask the approval of Parliament and, when
passed, carry the approval of Parliament for
the expenditure of certain sums.
Having said that, I come to the second
paragraph of the report which deals with the
[Hon. Mr. Grosart.1

March 25, 1970

total amounts involved. At face value the
figure in the bill and in the Estimates, as
reported by the committee, is correct. Having used the word "disclosure", however,
I point out that there is always in the Estimates as presented to us an element of non-

disclosure in the "fine print." In these Estimates, in addition to the amounts reported by
the committee, there is an additional $19 million of public funds being transferred from
one vote to another which is not included
in the total before us. This $19 million
in the second supplementary Estimates covers
part of the financial year, and I think
it is important that honourable senators be
aware of that fact if we are going to do the
job I think the public expects of us here. We
have to examine not only the figures in the
right-hand columns but also those that appear
in the text on the left-hand side.
In paragraph three of the report of the
committee honourable senators will see this
sentence:
Your committee reiterates its concern
about the practice of making statutory
changes by means of Appropriation Acts
based on supplementary Estimates.
If honourable senators care to examine the
two relevant documents, one of which is the
supplementary Estimates themselves and the
other the bill before us, they will find a
great difference between the two in an item
which I shall come to in a moment. For
example, there are 20 or 30 lines in the Estimates dealing with this vote which was the
subject of my earlier question to Senator
Leonard, but when we corne to the bill itself
we find there are only two lines.
On page 4 of the bill, the supplementary
Estimates as asked for by the Department of
Agriculture, there is an item 17b, which was
the subject of considerable discussion in paragraph 4 of the committee's report. When the
representatives of the Treasury Board were
before us in open committee, they informed
us that they had reason to believe that the
request for approval of the item as it stands
in the supplementary Estimates would not be
effective. I asked Senator Leonard if there
had been some amendments made and, if so,
were they available in a public document.
The reply which I have just had is that it was
decided not to make those changes To me this
is an amazing situation because we had
before us, and it will appear in our proceedings, the evidence of the officials that the actthis new Wheat Board Act, because that is

March 25, 1970

SENATE DEBATES

what it is-might not be effective in the wording as it appears in the supplementary Estimates. If this is so, I am wondering how this
complete change in our agricultural policy,
involving the payment of $105 million, is to
be effective if it is covered by only two lines
in an act of Parliament.
Honourable senators, this raises the whole
question that is discussed in paragraph 4,
namely, this almost unbelievable practice of
asking Parliament to approve substantive
legislation in an appropriation bill. Unless I
am reading the bill improperly, I say that we
are now being asked to make an extensive
amendment altering the entire wheat policy
of the Government of Canada in two lines in
an appropriation act.
I have said on an earlier occasion that this
is probably the old story of a small bad habit
becoming a big bad one. That is why I am
personally glad to see that the committee has
again drawn to the attention of the chamber
the usual but unjustifiable practice of making
statutory amendments by $1 items.
Of course, what happened was that someone, a long way back, discovered this interesting fiction, this expedient, this device. Over
the years in our committee meetings we have
asked the officials, "Why do you do it this
way? Why do you amend acts of Parliament
with a $1 vote?" Their invariable answer has
been, "This is the only way we can do it if we
want to get quick action." They have also

that there are times when the use of an
appropriation bill is justified, but there are
more times than not when, in my view, it is
not justified. The suggestion I am going to
make, for what it is worth, is that in future
when we have an appropriation bill before
Parliament which amends existing acts of
Parliament, it should contain a final clause to
the effect: "The following acts of Parliament
are hereby amended." Then we could at least
be in a position of having an amendment of
an act of Parliament recorded. As I have said
before, there are innumerable cases of
amendments by appropriation act which
never appear in the Revised Statutes or even
in the office consolidations.
If the law of Canada is not to be found in
the Revised Statutes of Canada or, during the
interim between revisions, in the office consolidations of acts of Parliament, then surely
amendment of acts of Parliament by this
method is an invalidation of any statement
that the statute law of Canada is to be found
in the laws as officially published from time
to time.
I could give many instances of this. There
is one in this bill. It is to be found on page 13,
in the schedule under "Loans, Investments
and Advances". Vote L97b under "Industry,
Trade and Commerce" reads as follows:
To increase to $1,950,000 the amount

SENATE DEBATES
another one, because I think we have enough
already-to consider the matter I have just
raised.
The fifth paragraph of the report deals with
the same matter. The suggestion is made
there, which is perhaps a modification of the
one I have made, that these statute changes
be noted marginally. I do not think this is
enough. We have to go beyond mere marginal
notices. We have had enough of that particular device as well.
Finally, because these are the final supplementary Estimates for the fiscal year just
ending, we are dealing with consideration of
the total government expenditures for the
year. One of the recommendations of the
committee was that there should be a relationship maintained between the growth in
federal expenditure and the growth of the
G.N.P. There is some evidence in the record
of the last year that some attention has been
paid to that. However, if we look at the 196970 figures we find that our expenditures are
higher and in excess of the growth of the
G.N.P. I merely say that I believe the recommendation made by the Standing Senate
Committee on National Finance on previous
occasions was an excellent one, and unless it
is given serious attention by the Government
we are going to find ourselves, before very
long, in a position where the demands of the
Government on the economy will be selfdefeating. There have been many studies as
to what a justifiable level might be. At the
moment we are not quite sure in Canadabecause the figures from the Economic Council of Canada and others are conflicting-as to
what is the present, if I may use the term,
"total Government take" from the economy.
The figures range somewhere between 35 per
cent and 40 per cent. There must be a practical limit somewhere. If we are to continue
increasing the Government percentage of
"take" from the productivity of this country,
we will reach a point of self-defeat for the
Government itself.
One of the ways this country can go broke
is by having too high an administrative cost
of running the country. This applies to almost
any business or organization. I call attention
at this time to the warning by Senator Leonard's committee. I trust it will be given

The Hon. the Speaker: Order; we are considering Bill C-200 now. Bill C-201 will be
called within a few minutes.
Hon. Mr. Martin: You have given us an
opportunity to think about the answer.
The Hon. the Speaker: May I inform
honourable senators that if the honourable
Senator Leonard speaks now, his speech will
have the effect of closing the debate.
Hon. Mr. Leonard: Honourable senators, I
would be remiss in closing this debate if I did
not acknowledge with thanks the kind
remarks Senator Grosart directed to the
chairman of the committee. I should also say
a word with respect to one or two of the
pertinent remarks he made as to the report of
the committee.
In connection with his question with regard
to the change in Supplementary Estimates
(B), I wish to make my own impression clear
that it was not the officers of the Treasury
Board who indicated that there would be a
suggested change in the supplementary
Estimates. My understanding is that they
were conveying to us the information that
the Miscellaneous Estimates Committee of
the House of Commons were recommending
such a change in their report. While there
may have been some ground for that recommendation, as far as we are concerned,
apparently it was not accepted by the Government or by the House of Commons. Therefore, the bill as it comes before us is based
exactly on the supplementary Estimates,
regardless of what a committee of the other
place or some people in the other place may
have thought should be changed in it. I think
that that is all I need add at the present time.
Senator Grosart has made a suggestion
with respect to the addition of a clause in the
supplementary Estimates and in the appropriation bill as to the amendment of statutes.
That is a matter that could be considered in
the future, although my own opinion as a
lawyer having to refer to statutes would be
that marginal notations would really be more
effective than its mere inclusion in an appropriation act.
That is all I have to say, honourable senators. I commend to you the second reading of
the bill.
Hon. Mr. Grosart: In explanation of my
earlier remarks I should say that I fully
accept the statement of the position as it was,
which has been given by Senator Leonard. I

SENATE DEBATES
others. Those fees do not come in evenly
throughout the year, so this bill requests an
additional six-twelfths of the $533,000. In all,
the vote of the Finance Department would
then be nine-twelfths, being the general
three-twelfths plus an additional six-twelfths
which will carry it through until the end of
June, leaving another three-twelfths on which
to finance the rest of the year.
The bill also covers the borrowing powers
of the government for the year. It authorizes
borrowings up to $2 billion. It also cancels
what is left of a similar borrowing power
authorized a year ago. In other words, a year
ago $2 billion was authorized. The Government used as much of that as it required. The
amount requested is generally in excess of
the actual amount required, so that the Government may take care of any emergency
that arises. This bill cancels whatever is left
of last year's authorized borrowing power and
provides a new authority for $2 billion for the
whole of the current year.
The bill is in the usual form of interim
supply bills. It makes clear that no vote is
completely released. Therefore, I can give the
usual undertaking that it does not interfere in
any way with the freedom of senators to
exercise all the privileges they now have with
respect to any vote, notwithstanding that we
are granting anywhere from three-twelfths to
nine-twelfths of that vote. That undertaking
as to the rights of honourable senators continues and applies in committee and in the
Senate, whenever they wish to exercise it.
That covers what I wish to say, but if there
are any questions I will do my best to answer
them.
Hon. Allister Grosari: Honourable senators,
once again we have to thank Senator Leonard
for a very clear explanation of what we are
being asked to do in passing this first appropriation bill of the current fiscal year.
This is, of course, an interim supply bill.
We have had many of them before us on
previous occasions. Senator Leonard has
spoken of the greatly improved system in
the procedure preceding the time that a
bill such as this comes before us. I agree with
him entirely, that the change in the rules of
the other place by which the Estimates are
now referred to specific committees with a
reporting deadline, rather than dragging them
over the whole year in Committee of the
Whole, is a very progressive step forward
However, we are still in the same old position, here because we have received this bill
at the last minute. The difference between
[Hon. Mr. Leonard.]

March 25, 1970

this bill and Bill C-200, which we have just
passed, is that under our own procedure we
had, with respect to the previous bill,
a report from our own Finance Committee,
and on the basis of the study by the
committee and its report, members of the
Senate were prepared to pass that bill. We
have no such report on this bill, although we
have an excellent explanation from Senator
Leonard.
I have suggested on previous occasions that
interin supply bills should be referred by the
Senate to the Standing Senate Committee on
National Finance, and I repeat that suggestion today. The answer that is usually given
is that it is "just interim supply" and that it
is merely a bill which says that we will
advance to the Government certain amounts
of money subject to examination by committees on the Estimates before them. Of course,
it is also true that the main Estimates have
been before our committee. There is a difference, however, between an examination of
the main Estimates and an examination of a
particular bill such as this which does much
more than merely allocate a certain sum
of money. It is much more than an advance.
Again, this is an act of Parliament and
there are matters dealt with in this bill which
go beyond merely an advance to the Government to meet its requirements between
now and June. In fact, it was not very long
ago that the Government took refuge in a
supply bill to justify an action taken by the
Government that would otherwise certainily
have been constitutionally unjustifiable and
morally something less than justifiable.
I suggest to honourable senators that on
this occasion we should insist that we be
given the opportunity to refer these interim
supply bills to our committee. It is completely
beyond me to know why these bills invariably come to us under the gun of a pending
recess or adjournment. I am not going to ask
Senator Leonard to explain it, but I hope that
some day someone will explain to my satisfaction why this particular bill could not have
been before us two or three weeks ago. I
know of no procedural reason for the delay. It
seems to me that if the officials were given a
deadline of this day, which happens to be the
last day on which Parliament will be sitting
before the Easter recess, surely they could
have been given a deadline of a day two
weeks or even a month earlier.
The basic material in this bill before us has
all been prepared for many months, and it
has been in a public document for a number

March 25, 1970

SENATE DEBATES

of months. Why can we not have bills like
this before us under conditions which will not
be an insult to the intelligence of honourable
senators? I say it is an insult to be in the
position that one hour ago I inquired of our
own staff for a copy of this bill and none was
available. It was available only a half hour
before this chamber sat at 2 o'clock.
I suggest, honourable senators, this is not
the way for Members of Parliament to do
public business involving the spending of the
amount of money that we are being asked to
approve in this case. I suggest again, as I
did earlier, that the small bad habit is becoming a big bad one. I would be interested to
know if there is any other explanation,
except just sheer bad habit, behind the fact
that we received this bill today in the precincts of this chamber half an hour before we
sat. This is perhaps something that could be
considered by those who have the management of the work of this chamber, and I
would hope that the time will soon come
when we will not be so concerned about
adjourning or recessing and will say to the
Government, "No. We want more time to discharge our responsibilities to the public."
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Rhéal Bélisle: Mr. Chairman, I would
like to raise a question now as to Bill C-201,
which we are presently dealing with. My
question is under Vote 1, page 10, Privy
Counil which states:
Privy Council Office-Program expenditures including maintenance and operation of the Prime Minister's residence,
and the payment to each member of the
Queen's Privy Council for Canada who is
a Minister without Portfolio of a salary
of $7,500The total is $5,359,700. Unfortunately, I am
not a member of the Standing Senate Committee on National Finance. I heard the chairman say that the best place to ask the question would be in the Finance Committee. But,
if I may, I should like to ask a short question
Is the salary of $7,500 to be paid only to the
present Minister without Portfolio or is it to
be paid to all those who have been appointed
Privy Counillors or who are entitled to use
the suffix P.C.?

Hon. Mr. Grosart: I thought Senator Belisle
might be about to move an amendment.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: Honourable senators, the
sum set out appears to me to be quite impressive, if it concerns only the maintenance and
operation of the Prime Minister's residence
and the payment of the special salary to ministers without portfolio. Program expenditures, of course, are the key words. I wonder
what is included in that.
Hon. Mr. Martin: The word is "including".
Hon. Mr. Bélisle: In other words, my question is this. If there are but a few present
ministers without portfolio receiving it, and
if it concerns the maintenance of the Prime
Minister's residence, why is it over $5 million?
Hon. Mr. Flynn: Who is on the payroll?
Hon. Mr. Martin: And "including". "Program expenditures including".
Hon. Mr. Leonard: Honourable senators, I
am glad some of the members of the Privy
Council can answer the first part of Senator
Belisle's question better than I can. As to the
second part, to answer the question properly
would require a study of the Privy Council
items in the main Estimates. The particular
item about which the senator is inquiring is
set out there. It describes the program of
activities, and gives the details of the various
expenditures making up the $5 million.
It might be that if one had a little time to
look over these Estimates, one could answer
the question now. In any event, probably the
best way would be at a committee meeting, to
make sure that either it is answered by what
is shown in the main Estimates as printed, or
that it is answered by a member of the Privy
Council Office coming before the committee. I
can assure Senator Belisle that either one or
the other will be done.

Hon. Lazarus Phillips: Honourable senators,
personally as a member of the Standing
Senate Committee on National Finance, I
would like to record again my appreciation of
and profound esteem for Senator Leonard,
and for the extraordinarily efficient way in
which he directs the deliberations of this
committee.
The only point I would like to make is one
which I made last year and this is by way of

of statutory limitation to the national debt.

I feel that my cbservations are relevant,
Council, I can answer that in the negative. because of clause 5 of the bill before us now,

SENATE DEBATES
authorizing the raising of loans up to $2
billion.
I have repeated before, and I should like to
record again in this chamber, my view that
the expenditures of Government will never
be properly controlled if we attempt to relate
them to gross national product, because
G.N.P. in any given year can only be determined, of course, long after the close of such
financial year. In any event, there are so
many uncertainties in relation to this, that it
is a haphazard exercise.
My view bas been previously recorded, and
this will probably be my last opportunity to
record it again. Therefore, I would like to
have it on the record that I think the only
way to curb the executive, in so far as federal
expenditures are concerned, is to see that
Parliament, in any givien year, by statute,
imposes a statutory limitation on the national
debt of our country.
I know that there are various ways in
which we deal with the national debt. We
have gross national debt and net national
debt. I am assuming a formula which would
be known to all, that is to say, to the executive as well as to Parliament. Assuming
that we arrive at such a formula, it is my
view that when we make appropriations
in the current year, such appropriations and
borrowing powers given to Government
should be conditional on the national debt of
the country at the close of the current year
not being in excess of a certain sum of
money.
In other words, if at the end of March 31,
1970, the national debt of Canada is X dollars
then we should say that if we are to live
within our means, at least that the national
debt at the close of the following fiscal year,
which we are now commencing, shall not
exceed the amount of X dollars, or shall not
exceed that amount other than by a percentage-whatever percentage Parliament in its
wisdom determines.
HonLurable senators, that is al I wish to
say. I would like to record that, not as a
parting wish but I may not be here for further appropriation bills and I should like to
have this on the record.

March 25, 1970

and it may be that I have achieved that
objective today.
Hon. Mr. Martin: It certainly is not going to
be your last speech.
Hon. Mr. Leonard: Honourable senatorsThe Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, I must inform you that if honourable
Senator Leonard speaks now, it will have the
effect of closing the debate.
Hon. Mr. Leonard: Honourable senators,
may I speak, first of all, to Senator Grosart's
suggestion that this bill or any interim supply
bill should be referred to the Standing Senate
Committee on National Finance. This is a
matter on which I do not agree with my
honourable colleague.
My point of view is that there is no question which could have been asked at a hearing by the committee, on a reference of this
bill to the committee, that cannot be equally
effectively asked and answered in the subsequent hearings of the committee.
No vote is released, no right of any senator
is prejudiced. The committee will be sitting
again as soon as we convene after the Easter
recess. It will be sitting regularly, I hope,
every Thursday and if there is any question
at all with respect to Bill C-201 it can be
asked then as effectively as if the bill had
gone before the committee yesterday, shall we
say.
Hon. Mr. Grosari: On that point, could I
ask the honourable senator one question.
Would he not agree that there are matters
before us in such a bill that are not in the
Estimates? For example, would he not agree
that it might be a useful exercise for the
committee to consider whether the request for
three months' supply was necessary at this
time?

Hon. Mr. Leonard: Honourable senators, I
think the only matter that is in the bill, apart
from the Estimates, is exactly the matter to
which the honourable senator refers, that is,
the additional amounts over three months'
supply that are requested. Actually, I have
full information with respect to each one of
those here now. I did not think it necessary to

[Hon. Mr. Phillip

(Rigaud).]

March 25, 1970

SENATE DEBATES

between now and May 31 we will get all the
information we want.
I have assured Senator Belisle that his
question will be dealt with. In respect to the
question by Senator Phillips (Rigaud), generally, I find myself in agreement with him, but
so far I am not persuaded by him as to the
ceiling on debt. Perhaps some of these days
he will prove to be right and I to be wrong.
We have considered the ceiling in our committee and have put the question to various
witnesses of some competence and knowledge,
and so far I think on the evidence the case is
not conclusive towards a debt ceiling. The
matter is certainly sonething to be kept in
mind, and I would say further that this clause
in the interim supply bill granting the borrowing power has a bearing on the question.
True, it is not an over-ail debt ceiling but, if
we were reaching a stage where the question
of an over-all debt ceiling was really important, then of course this clause in the interim
supply bill does give full opportunity to Parliament to decide whether or not they want to
give the Government an additional $1 billion
or $2 billion or whatever might be asked.
Every year the Government bas to come back
to Parliament and get its authority for new
borrowings for the year.

Hon. Mr. Flynn: That is a valid answer, but
we could also add that the Government in the
other place is saving two other debates on the
matter.
Hon. Mr. Martin: Senator Leonard's answer
is better than the one you gave me, Senator
Flynn, when you were in the other place.
Hon. Mr. Grosart: Perhaps the sponsor of
the bill would tell us if any of the Estimates
have been approved.
Hon. Mr. Leonard: I have not followed that
closely enough, but I have the impression that
some of the committees have reported.
Hon. Mr. Martin: That is right.

Hon. Mr. Fournier (Madawaska-Restigouche): I should like to ask Senator Leonard a
question.
We have been told by the chairman of the
committee on several occasions that all these
bills are approved by Parliament. Is that a
true statement, or are they approved by the
Government in power? I have been in the

were not approved by the Opposition, and yet
