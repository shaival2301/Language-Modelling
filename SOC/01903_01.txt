OFFICIAL REPORT
THE SENATE
Speaker: Hon.

GEORGE PARENT

Thursday, January 22, 1942.
The Parliament of Canada 'having been
summoned by Proclamation of the Governor
General to meet this day for the dispatch of
business:
The Senate met at 2.30 p.m., the Speaker
in the Chair.
Prayers.
OPENING

OF THE SESSION

The Hon. the SPEAKER informed the
Sena.te that he had received a communication
General's
Secretary,
Governor
from the
informing him that His Excellency the
Governor General would proceed to the
Senate Chamber to open the session of the
Dominion Parliament this day at three
o'clock.
The Senate adjourned during pleasure.
SPEECH

FROM

THE

THRONE

At three
o'clock His Excellency the
Governor General proceeded to the Senate
Chamber and took his seat upon the Throne.
His Excellency was pleased to command the
attendance of the House of Commons, and
that House being come, with their Speaker,
His Excellency was pleased to open the
Third Session of the Nineteenth Parliament
of Canada with the following speech:
Honourable Members of the Senate:
Members of the House of Commons:
There no longer can be any question as to
the character and scope of the present war.
It is a world-wide ebnflict between irreconcilable forces. On every continent, including the
confines of our own, and on all oceans, forces
that aim at world domination oppose forces
that seek the preservation of freedom. In
every quarter of the globe, civilization is confronted by savagery.
The conflict can have but one of two outcomes. Either tyranny, based on terror and
brutality, must be overthrown; or the free
peoples of the world, one and all, slowly but

eventually, will be reduced to a state of bondage.
Upon the outcome depends, for generations, the
future well-being of mankind.
There are strong reasons for belief in the
overthrow of tyranny, and the ultimate triumph
of freedom. The Axis Powers, Germany, Italy
and Japan, now fight as one. So do the peoples
of the British Commonwealth, of the United
States, Russia, China and the many other
nations that, on the first day of this new year,
united in a pact to fight together until victory
is achieved. The marshalling of the free forces
of the greatest industrial nations in the world
makes clear the scale upon which the conflict
will now be waged on many fronts.
During the present session, opportunity will
be afforded for the fullest consideration and
discussion of Canada's war effort, actual and
prospective. My advisers will submit to you the
measures deemed essential to our national
security, and for the prosecution of the war
to the utmost of our strength.
In accordance with the Government's policy
of a total national effort for total war, you will
be asked to approve a balanced programme for
further increases in the armed forces and in
the production of munitions of war and of
foodstuffs. The increase in the armed forces
will involve an expansion of the establishment
of the Canadian army overseas. You widll also
be asked, as an integral part of Canada's direct
war effort, to approve a contribution to Britain
of vast quantities 'f munitions, foodstuffs and
supplies.
The Government's policy of national selective
service will be extended, as generally and
rapidly as may be necessary, to effect the orderly
and efficient employment of the men and women
of Canada for the varied purposes of war.
You will be advised of the means the Government proposes to adopt, to effect as complete
as possible a mobilization of the material
resources and manpower of the country in
direct furtherance of a total national effort.
My advisers believe that the magnitude and
balanced nature of Canada's war effort is being
obscured and impaired by controversy concerning commitments with respect to the methods
of raising men for military service which were
made prior to the spread of the war to all
parts of the world.
The Government is of the opinion that, at
this time of gravest crisis in the world's history,
the Administration, subject only to its responsibility to Parliament, should in this connection
and irrespective of any previous commitments,
possess complete freedom to act in accordance
with its judgment of the needs of the situation
as they may arise.
My Ministers accordingly will seek, from the
people, by means of a plebiscite, release from
any obligation arising out of any past commitments restricting the methods of raising men
for military service.

44567-1
REVISED EDITION

SENATE

2

Members of the House of Commons:
You will be asked te make financial provision
on an unprecedented seale for the expansion and
maintenance of Canada's armed forces and for
war production.
Yeu will be asked to make financial provision
for implementing agreements with the provinces
to facilitate'the orderly and equitable mobilizatien of the financial resources of the country
to the utmost limit of its capacity.
Honourable Members of the Senate:
Members of the House of Commons:
I am confident that in no particular will the
Canadian people fail in the full discharge of

REPORT OF TPHE PROCEEDINGS

A meeting of Members of the
of the House of Commons was
House of Commcns Chamber,
Tuesday, December 30, 1941, at 3

Senate and
held in the
Ottawa, on
p.m.

Hon. James Allison Glen, Speaker of the
House of Commons, presided.
Your Royal Highness,
Mr. SPEAKER:
Mr. Churchill, honourable members of the
Senate and of the House of Commons, ladies
and gentlemen: I would ask the Right Honourable Mackenzie King, the Prime Minister
of Canada, to introduce the Right Honourable Winston Churchill, the Prime Minister
of Britain.
Right Hon. W. L. MACKENZIE KING
Mr. Speaker,
(Prime Minister of Canada):
honourable members of the Senate and of the
House of Commons, on behalf of the Government and people of Canada I have the honour
this afternoon to renew the welcome already
extended from all parts of our country to the
Prime Minister of Britain, the Right Honourable Winston Churchill.
I desire to express to Mr. Churchill the
thanks of the entire country for his visit to
Canada at this time. I thank him also for
having so kindly consented, while in our
capital city, to address the members of the
two Houses of Parliament, and to speak,
from this House of Commons Chamber, to
all the people of Canada.
I need not say to Mr. Churchill how unbounded is our admiration of the brave

JANUARY 22, 1942

people of Britain. Nor need I tell him how
completely he is, to us, the personification
of Britain's greatness. That greatness was
never more apparent than in this time of
gravest crisis in the history of the world.
I speak, Mr. Churchill, for all the members
of both Houses when I say that the Parliament of Canada was never more sure of its
ground than when, at the very beginning of
the war, it took its stand at the side of
Britain in her determination to thwart
aggression and to preserve freedom. Canada
was never prouder of that stand than today, when, after sharing in arms for more
than two and a quarter years, with Britain
and other nations of the British Commonwealth
in the defence of freedom, she is honoured, as

we especially are this afternoon, by the presence
in her halls of Parliament of the man who, by
his clear vision, undaunted courage, inspired
utterance and heroic spirit, has given such incomparable leadership to the hosts of freedom.
Again I speak for all members of Parliament and for the Canadian people as a whole
when I say that we are unreservedly determined to maintain our stand at Britain's side
and at the side of the other nations that
fight for freedom. In that determination we

are also resolved to put forth our utmost
effort until the day of ultimate triumph
over the evil forces that now seek to deminate the world.
Mr. Churchill, it is the prayer of the people
of Canada that the Divine Power by which
your life has been guided and guarded amid

the perils and vicissitudes of war may continue to give you the vision, the wisdom
and the endurance required for your mighty
task. May you be spared to share in the
hour

of victory

the reward of your life's

endeavours.
Mr. Speaker: the Prime Minister of Great
Britain, the
Churchill.

Right

Honourable

Winston

Right
Hon.
WINSTON
SPENCER
CHURCHILL (Prime Minister of Great
Britain): Mr. Speaker, members of the
Senate and members of the House of Commons, it is with feelings of pride and encouragement that I find myself here in the
House of Commons of Canada, invited to
address the Parliament of the senior Dominion of the Crown. I am very glad to see
again my old friend

Mr. Mackenzie King,

for fifteen out of twenty years your Prime
Minister, and I thank him for the all too

complimentary terms in which he has referred
to myself.
I bring you, Mr. Speaker, the assurance
of goodwill and affection from everyone in
the Motherland. We are most grateful for
44567-1

I

all you have done in the common cause, and
we know that you are resolved to do whatever more is possible as the need arises
and as opportunity serves.
Canada, Sir, occupies a unique position in
the British Empire because of its unbreakable
ties with Britain and its ever-growing friendship and intimate association with the United
States. Canada is a potent magnet, drawing together those in the new world and
in the old whose fortunes are now united in
a deadly struggle for life and honour against
the common foe.
The contribution of Canada to the Imperial
war effort, in troops, in ships, in aircraft, in
food and in finance, has been magnificent. The
Canadian army now stationed in England has
chafed not to find itself in contact with the
enemy, but I am here to tell you that it
has stood and still stands in the key position
to strike at the invader should he land upon
our shores. In a few months, when the
invasion season returns, the Canadian army
may be engaged in one of the most frightful
battles the world has ever seen. Upon the
other hand their presence may help to deter
the enemy from attempting to fight such a
battle on British soil. Although, Sir, the
long routine of training and preparation is
undoubtedly trying to men who left prosperous farms and businesses or other responsible
civil work, inspired by an eager and ardent

desire to fight the enemy, although this is
trying to high-mettled temperaments, the
value of the service rendered is unquestionable, and the peculiar kind of self-sacrifice
involved will, I am sure, be cheerfully or at
least patiently endured.
Sir, the Canadian Government has imposed
no limitation upon the use of the Canadian
army, whether upon the continent of Europe
or elsewhere, and I think it extremely unlikely that this war will end without the
Canadian army coming to close quarters with
the Germans, as their fathers did at Ypres,
on the Somme, or on the Vimy Ridge.
Already, at Hong Kong, that beautiful
colony which the industry and mercantile
enterprise of Britain had raised from a desert
isle and made the greatest port of shipping
in the whole world--at Hong Kong, that
colony wrested from us for a time, until we
reach the peace table, by the overwhelming
power of the home forces of Japan, to which
it lay in proximity-at Hong Kong soldiers
of the Royal Rifles of Canada and the Winnipeg Grenadiers, under a brave officer whose
loss we mourn, have played a valuable part
in gaining precious days and have crowned
with military honour the reputation of their
native land.

4

SENATE

Another major contribution made by Canada to the Imperial war effort is the wonderful and gigantie Empire Training Scheme for
pilots for the Royal and Imperial Air Forces.
This has now been, as you know well, in
full career for nearly two years under conditions free from all interference by the
enemy.
The daring youth of Canada, Australia and
New Zealand, togetier with many thousands
from the homeland, are perfecting their training under the best conditions, and we have
been assisted on a large scale by the United
States, many of whose training facilities have
been placed at our disposal. This scheme will
provide us in 1942 and 1943 with the highest
class of trained pilots, observers and air
gunners, in the numbers necessary to man
the enormous flow of aireraft which the factories of Britain, of the Empire and of the
United States are and will be producing.
I could, Sir, speak also on the naval
production of corvettes, and above all of
merch'ant ships, which is proceeding on a
scale almost equal to the building of the
United Kingdom, all of which Canada bas
set on foot.
I could speak of many other actixitivs. of
tanks, of the special forms of modern highvelocity cannon, of the great supplies of raw
materials and many other elements essential
to our war effort, on which your labours are
ceaselessly and tirelessly engaged. But I must
not let my address to you become a catalogue.
I turn to less technical fields of tbougbt.
Sir, we did not make this war. We did not
seek it. We did all we could to avoid it.
We did too much to avoid it. We went so
far in trying to avoid it as to be almost
destroyed by it when it broke upon us. But
that dangerous corner has been turned, and
with every month and every year that passes
we shall confront the evil-doers with weapons
as plentiful, as sharp and as destructive as
those with which they have sought to establish
their hateful domination.
I should like to point out to you, Mr.
Speaker, that we have not at any time asked
for any mitigation in the fury or malice of
the enemy. The peoples of the British Empire
may love peace. They do not seek the lands
or wealth of any country. But they are a
tougb and hardy lot. We have not journeyed
all this way across the centuries, across the
oceans, across the mountains, across the
prairies, because we are made of sugar candy.
Look at the Londoners, the Cockneys. Look
at what they stood up to, grim and gay, with
their cry, "We can take it," and their war-time
mood-"What is good enough for anybody is
good enough for us."

We have not asked that the rules of the
game should be modified. We shall never
descend to the German and Japanese level;
but if anybody likes to play rough we can
play rough too. Hitler and his Nazi gang
have sown the wind; let them reap the whirlwind. Neither the length of the struggle nor
any form of severity which it may assume
shall make us weary or shall make us quit. I
have been all this week with the President of
the United States, that great man whom
destiny has marked for this climax of human
fortune. We have been concerting the united
pacts and resolves of more than thirty states
and nations to fight on in unity together and
in fidelity one to another. without any
thought except the total and final extirpation
of the Hitler tyranny, the Japanese frenzy and
the Mussolini flop.
There shall be no halting or half measures,
there shall be no compromise or parley. These
gangs of bandits have sought to darken the
Iight of the world, have sought to stand
between the common people of all the lands
and their march forward into their inheritance;
they shall themselves be cast into the pit of
deatb and shame. And only when the earth
has been cleansed and purged of their crimes
and their villainy will we turn from the task
which they have forced upon us, a task which
we were reluctant to undertake, but which we
will now riost faithfully and punctiliously
discharge.
Mr. Speaker, according to my sense of
proportion this is no time to speak of hopes
of the future or of the broader world which
lies beyond our struggles and our victory.
We have to win that world for our children.
We have to win it by our sacrifices. We have
not won it yet. The crisis is upon us. The
power cf the enemy is immense. If we were
in any way to underrate the strength, the
resources or the ruthless savagery of that
enemy we should jeopardize not only or
lives-for they will be offered freely-but the
cause of human freedom and progress to
which we have vowed ourselves and all we
have. We cannot for a moment, Sir, afford to
relax. On the contrary, we must drive ourselves forward with unrelenting zeal. In this
strange, terrible world war there is a place
for everyonc, man and woman, old and young,
hale and halt. Service in a thousand forms is
open. There is no room now for the dilettante,
for the weaklintg, for the shirker or the
sluggard. The mine, the factory, the dockyard,
the salt sea waves, the fields to till, the home,
the hospital, the chair of the scientist, the
pulpit of the preacber--from the highest to
the humblest, the tasks all are of equal
honour. All have their part to play. The

JANUARY 22, 1942
enemies ranged against us, coalesced and
combined against us, have asked for total war.
Let us make sure they get it.
That grand old minstrel, Harry Lauder-Sir
Harry Lauder, I should say, and no hon or
was better deserved-had a song in the last
war which began:
If ive ail look back o'er the history of the past,
We can just see where we are.
Let us then look back.
Sir, wýe plunged
into this war ail unprepared because we had
pledged our word to stand by the side of

Peland, which Hitler hiad. feloniously invaded
and, in spite of a gallant resistance, had soon
struck down. There followed those astonishing
seven months which were called on this side

of the Atlantic the "phoney" war. Suddenly
the explosion of pent-up German strength and
preparation burst upon Norway, Denmark,
Holland and Belgium. Ail these absolutely
blameless neutrals, to most of whom Germany
up to the last moment was giving every kind
of guarantee and assurance, were overrun and
trampled down. The hideous massacre of
Rotterdamo, where thirty thousand people
perished, showed the ferocious barbarism in
which the German air force revels when, as

in Warsaw and later Belgrade, it was able to
bomb practically undefended cities.
On top of ail this came the great French
catastrophe. The French army collapsed and
the French nation was daslied into utter and,
as it bas proved so far, irretrievable confusion.
The French Government had, at their own
suggestion, solemnly bound themselves with
us not to make a separate peace. It was
their duty, and it was aise their interest, to
go to North Africa, where they would have
been at the head cf the French Empire. In
Africa with our aid they would have had
overwhelming sea power; they would have
had the recognition cf the United States, and
the use of ail the gold they have lodged
beyond the seas. If they had donc this, Italy
might have been driven eut cf the war before
the end cf 1940, and France would have held
her place as a nation in the councils cf the
Allies, and at the conference table of the
victors.
But their generals misled them. When I
warned them that Britain would fight on
alone, whatever they did, their generals told
their Prime Minister and bis divided cabinet,
"In three weeks England will have her neck
wrung like a chieken." Some chickcnl Some

What a contrast, Sir, has been the behaviour
cf the valiant, stout-hearted Dutch, who stili
stand forth as a strong-living partncr in the

They fawned upon

And what have they got eut cf it?

The fragment cf France which was left to

them is *just as powcrless, just as hungry, as
the occupied regions themselves, and even
more miserable, because more divided. Hitler
plays from day te day a cat-and-mouse game
with these tormented men. One day he will
charge them a littie less for holding their
ceuntrymen down. Another day he will ]et
out a few thoýusand broken prisoners cf war
from the million and a haif or million and
thrce-.quarters he bas collected. Or, again, he
will shoot a hundred French hestages te give

favours the Vichy Governmeet have been

moment it may suit Hitler's plans te brush

But now, Sir, strong forces are at hand.
The tide hais turncd against the Hiin. Britain,
which the men cf Bordeaux thought and then

her Empire around her, carried the weight cf
the war alone for a wholc long year through

SENATE

The Russian armies under their warrior
leader Joseph Stalin are waging furious war
with increasing success along a thousandmile front of their invaded country. General
Auchinleck at the head of a British, South
African, New Zealand and Indian army is
striking down and mopping up the German
and Italian forces w-ho had attempted the
invasion of Egypt. Not only, Sir, are they
being mopped up in the desert, but great
numbers of them have been drowned on the
way there by the British submarines and the
in which Australian
Royal Air Force,
squadrons play their part. As I speak this
afternoon, an important battle is being fought
around Agedabia. We must not attempt to
prophesy its result, but I have good confidence. Sir, all this fighting in Libya proves
that when our men have equal weapons in
thcir hands and proper support from the air
they are more than a match for the Nazi
hordes.
In Libya as in Russia events of great importance and of most hopeful import have
taken place.
But, greatest of all, the
mighty republic of the United States has
entered the conflict, and entered it in a manner which shows that for her there can be
no withdrawal except by death or victory.
Et partout dans la France occupée et inoccupée, car leur sort est égal, les honnêtes
gens, le grand peuple, la nation française, se
redressent. L'espoir se rallume dans les coeurs

jour et la lumière grandit, rougeâtre mais
claire.
Nous ne perdrons jamais confiance que la
France jouera le rôle des hommes libres et
qu'elle reprendra, par des voies dures, sa
place dans la grande compagnie des nations
libératrices et victorieuscs.
Ici, au Canada, où la langue française est
honorée et parlée, nous nous tenons prêts et
armés pour aider et saluer cette résurrection
nationale.
(Translation): And everywhere in occupied
or unoccupied France, their lot being the
same, the decent portion of that great people,
the French nation, are raising their heads
again. Hope is revived in the hearts of a
warlike though disarmed race, cradle of
revolutionary liberties and scourge of conquerors. Everywhere breaks the dawn and
the light spreads, reddish but bright.
We shall ever be confident that France will
play the part of free men and that after many
trials she will regain her place among the
great victorious and liberating nations.

Here in Canada, where the French language
is cherished and spoken, we stand ready and
armed to help and welcome this national
resurrection.
(Text): Now that the whole of the North
American continent is becoming one gigantic
armed camp; now that the immense reserve
power of Russia is gradually becoming
apparent; now that long-suffering, unconquerable China secs help approaching; now that
the outraged and subjugated nations can see
daylight ahead, it is permissible to take a
broad forward view of the war.
Sir, we may observe three main periods or
phases in the struggle that lies before us.
First, there is the period of consolidation, of
combination, and of final preparation. In this
period, which will certainly be marked by
much heavy fighting, we shall still be gathering our strength, resisting the assaults of the
enemy, and acquiring the necessary overwhelming air superiority and shipping tonnage
to give our armies the power to traverse, in
whatever numbers may be necessary, the seas
and oceans which, except in the case of Russia,
separate us all from our foe. It is only when
the vast shipbuilding programme, on which
the United States bas already made so much
progress, and which you are powerfully aiding,
comes into full flood, that we shall be able
to bring the whole force of our manhood and
of our modern scientific equipment to bear
upon the enemy. How long this period will
take depends upon the vehemence of the
effort put into production in all our war
industries and shipyards.
The second phase, Sir, which will then be
open may be called the phase of liberation.
During this phase we must look to the
recovery of the territories which have been
lost or which may yet be lost, and also we
must look to the revolt of the conquered
peoples from the moment that the rescuing
and liberating armies and air forces appear
in strength within their bounds. For this
purpose it is imperative that no nation or
region overrun, that no government or state
which bas been conquered, should relax its
moral and physical efforts and preparations
for the day of deliverance. The invaders, be
they Germans or Japanese, must everywhere
be regarded as infected persons, to be shunned
and isolated as far as possible. Where active
resistance is impossible, passive resistance
must be maintained. The invaders and tyrants
must be made to feel that their fleeting
triumplas will have a terrible reckoning, and
that they are hunted men and that their cause
is doomed. Particular punishment will be
reserved for the Quislings and traitors who
make themselves the tools of the enemy.

7

JANUARY 22, 1942
They will be handed over ta the judgment of
their fellow countrymen.
Sir, there is a third phase which must also
be contemplated, namely, the assault upon the
itadels and homelands of the guilty powers
both in Europe and in Asia.
Thus I endeavour in a few words ta cast
same forward light upon the dark, inscrutable
mysteries of the future. But in thus forecasting the course along which we should seek
ta advance we must never forget that the
power of the enemy and the action of the
-enemy may at every stage affect our fortunes.
Moreover, Sir, you will notice that I have not
attempted ta assign any time limits ta the
various phases. These time limits depend
upon our exertions, upon our achievements,
.and upon the hazardous and uncertain course
of the war.
Nevertheless, I feel it is right at this
moment ta make it clear that, while an everincreasing bombing offensive against Germany
will remain one of the principal methods by
which we hope ta bring the war ta an end,
it is by no means the only method which our
growing strength now enables us ta take into
account. Evidently the most strenuous exertions must be made by all. As ta the form
which those exertions take, that is for each
partner in the Grand Alliance ta judge for
himself in consultation with others and in
harmony with the general scheme.
Let us then, Sir, address ourselves ta our
task, not in any way underrating its tremendous difficulties and perils, but in good heart
and sober confidence, resolved that, whatever
the cost, whatever the suffering, we shall
stand by one another, true and faithful comrades, and do our duty, God helping us,
ta the end.
Mr. SPEAKER: We will close this historic
meeting with the singing of the National
Anthem.
The National Anthem having been sung,
the gathering dispersed with three cheers for
Mr. Churchill.

THE LATE SENATORS ELLIOTT AND
HORSEY
TRIBUTES TO THEIR MEMORY

On the Orders of the Day:
Right Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND:
Honourable senators, it is my duty officially
ta draw the attention of the Senate ta the
departure of two of our colleagues in the
recess of November 4 ta January 21. The first
one ta leave us was Senator Elliott, who was
a barrister-at-law, and who, before he devoted.
so much of his time ta politics, was an active
practitioner. I am told by members of the
Ontario Bar that he had considerable success
before the courts. He belonged ta a family
which was very much interested in politics;
so it was no surprise at all ta see him representing Middlesex county for a number of
years in the Ontario Legislature. He was
elected ta the House of Commons in October,
1925, and from that time on was returned at
every election up ta the time of his appointment ta the Senate, in 1940. He was successively Minister of Labour, Minister of
Health, Minister of Soldiers' Civil Re-establishment, Minister of Public Works and
Postmaster General, and in all these positions
he served with distinction.
I confess that I had not very much contact
with my late colleague until I met him at the
Privy Council. There he enjoyed the esteem
of all his colleagues, who admired his sound
judgment and the contribution he brought ta
discussion of the questions and problems that
came before us. I had the privilege of attending with him a session of the League of
Nations at Geneva, where I heard nothing
but encomiums regarding him from members
of committees on which he sat.

8

SENATE

He was a most agreeable companion, with a
keen sense of humour, He had been brought
up in the small village of Glencoe, in Middlesex
county. One day he was pondering over a
problem which seemed to engross his mind.
I asked him to wlhat serious matter he was
giving such close attention, and he answered
me blandly: "I am just wondering wha.t the
opinion of my good people of Glencoe would
be on this international imatter." He and my
friend to my left (Hon. Mr. Euler) were often
to be found in earnest discussion, and I would
have the impression that they were exchanging
views about questions coming up before the
assembly, or in eonmmittee; but at last I discovered that the subject they were discoursing
over was prede-tination.
They apparently
held divergent views on this very controversial
subject, and it occurred to me that perhaps
the Baptist and Lutheran tenets on this point
did not agree.
Because of his vcry delicate health in recent
years, we were not greiatly surprised at Senator
Eliliott's departure. But distinctly a surprise
was the news of the death of Senator Horsey,
who was of the same age as Senator Elliott
and who always seemed in the pink of health.
with a physique that bespoke the strength of
the perfectly built athlete. His blue eyes
and winning smile at once revealed his kindly
nature and explained his popularity. He had
strong party ties. but his benevolence knew
no such bounds. His philanthropy extended
to all classes. Once he came to visit me at
the Privy Council to explain to me the distress of the family of a colleague of ours
whose life was cbbing away, and I recall what
trouble he took to alleviate their predicament.
That was one of many such incidents in our
late friend's life.
Our late colleague was born and educated
at Kingston. He took his degree of Bachelor
of Arts at Queon's University there. In his
commercial life he was primarily interested
in insurance companies whose business extended to the Orient, and bis work necessitated his travelling wide1y over many parts
of the world. He was closely connected with
publie utility bodies which serve the Ottawa
district. Throughout lis lifetime he retained
his interest in Queen's University, of which
he was for many years a trustee. Education
in any of its branees. never failcd to attract bis
attention and secure his support. His deep
interest in public affairs drew him to the
political field.
He had given considerable
thought to matters affecting bis community
and the country at large, and was well prepared to serve the people, but though ho
offered himself several times as a candidate
for the House. of Commons, he was not
succe-sful. He entered this Chamber in 1928,
Rigit Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

and while here was able, because of his wide
knowledge of public affairs, to render very
valuable service in our standing committees;
and many a time he spoke in this Chamber,
always to good effect. His advice was often
sought by the leaders of bis party, who could
always rely on his loyal and disinterested
counsel.
He enjoyed a happy life in the companionship of a most intelligent and devoted consort,
te whom I desire to express on behalf of myself
and all my colleagues our most sincere sympathy in ber great bereavement.
Hon. C. C. BALLANTYNE: It was only a
very short time ago that we listened to
Senator Horsey expressing in words of moving
eloquence and sympathy, as he was so well
qualified to do, his grief at the passing of
senators. Now we mourn the loss of our
colleague himself, whor we held in such high
esteecn. Senator Horsey took an active and
useful interest in the work of this Chamber.
A gentleman in every sense of the word, popular and well liked by every member of the
Senate, he will, indeed, be greatly missed.
I join with the right honourable leader in
expressing on behalf of all those sitting on this
side of the House our deepest sympathy with
Mrs. Horsey and members of ber family.
The passing of our late colleague Senator
Elliott is a distinct loss, net only to this
Chamber. but to the public life of Canada.
His brilliant legal attainrments are well known.
In his later life he became a member of the
Legislative Assembly of bis native province,
and then came to Ottawa as a member of the
House of Commons and a Minister of the
Crown, being subsequently elevated to the
Senate. It can be said of Senator Elliott that
he devoted bis life to the service of bis country.
Senator Elliott's sterling qualities of honesty
and high purpose were at all times highly
appreciated.
We on this side of the House join in the
symipathy and condolence so well expressed by
tie right honourable leader opposite (Right
Hon. Mr. Dandurand).
Hon. DUNCAN MARSHALL: Honourable
senators, I should like to make some remarks
with regard to the late Hon. J. C. Elliott, with
whom I was perbaps on more friendly terns
than with alnost any other politician.
Thirty-two years ago last December the
Hon. A. G. MacKay, who had been having a
soewhat tenpestuous career in politics in
the province of Ontario, met me on the streets
of Toronto. I said td' him, "Mac, you had
better come out to Edmonton and spend
Christmas with ie."
He hesitated a few
minutes and then said, "I will do that if you

JANUARY 27, 1942
wiil also take along a friend of mine." I asked,
"Who is your friend?" He repiied: "is name
is Jack Elliott. lie is the member for West
Middlesex and is one of *the best!1" I had not
seen him yet. I said, "Get him on the telephone and bring him along." Those were
the spacious days of Western Canada when the
plougbshare was just beginning to break the
prairies of Alberta, and when, whether we took
home one or balf a dozen men for Christmas
or other holidays, their number did nlot seem
to make much difference. So MacKay got bis
friend on the pbone, and next night he and
Jack and I started for Edmonton. I got
acquainted with Jack Elliott then, and for
tbirty-two years we met continually at bis
home and mine.
He came to Western Canada and bought a
farm, a section and a quarter, within about
twelve miles of my farm, and for the next
nine consecutive years Jack Eiliott spent two
summpr months in the West, with my home
as his home, andi we motored over the prairies
togetber. lie fenced bis farm, broke it, put
on some cattie, and fed two hundred beef
steers the third winter he was there. I began
te flnd onit tbat Jack Elliott was not a mere
iawyer-tbat four times be had crossed the
Atlantic with bis father's cattie to sell tbem
on Merkland's wharf in Glasgow, Scotland,
and tbat he could go on tbe prairie and pick
out good beasts just as well as the good
cattie men. Af ter a visit to Maple Creek
and one or two other ranches wbere we were
getting cattie, it became known among many
of the ranchers of Alberta, and to Pat Burns
in particular, that this lawyer from the
province of Ontario knew a lot about land
and a very great deal about cattie.
For the next nine summers Mr. Elliott and
I farmed together, part of the time on bis
land and part of the time on mine. He
invested in some other farms in Western
Canada, wbich be broke and put under cultivation. Eventually, because he had one or two
of bis farms in the drougbt district, he suffered
the same fate wbicb most of the men who
invested xnoney and broke land in Western
Canada suffered. But he neyer gave up; he
neyer stepped. lie had the idea of developing Western Canada as a farming cemmunity,
and was willing to spend time and energy to
do se.
lie came back to Ontario each fail and
spent the winters here. lie was a member of
the Ontario Legisiature for three terms, after
which he dropped out under circumstances
that 1 well remember. It was during the war,
and the Ontario Legisiature was prolonging
its life. I remember Jack's remarks on the
floor of the House. lie said that be did net

know that a Provincial Government bad much
to do with tbe war, and that if tbe Government was desirous of prolonging its life and
decided te do se be would not say it nay;
but he expressed tbe opinion that every man
who voted for sucb extension should be
beaten in the next election, and that very
likely niost of tbem weuld ha. lie was a
true prophet: they were wiped eut, herse,
foot and artiilery. Jack refused te run at ail,
and drepped eut of politics. Then wben Mr.
Drury took charge of public affairs be looked
for a lawyer-as ha said bimself, "an honest
Iawyer'-to advise the Government and bis
Atterney-General witb regard te* the legisiatien for the first session. J. C. Eiliott was
employed for that purpose, and he did a geod
job. His work gained him tbe admiration ef
many members of tbe legal profession in the
province of Ontario wbe had te do with
legisiation before tise Assembly. Mr. Elliott
then said be was tbrough with politics and
was going te practise Iaw and spend the money
hc made at law in farming.
Our leader (Righit lion. Mr. Dandurand)
reminded us of a bumorous remark made by
Mr. EIliott. I neyer knew a public man who
had a better sense of humeur than Jack
Elliott. lie neyer quarrelled witb anybody;
be was always able te inake soe claver
remark wbieh, as tbay say, enabled him te
"'get by.' 1 remember tbat when I was leaving this city on tbe 6th of November last,
Jnst a few weeks age, he asked me te come
in and spend an heur wi-tb him. I did se.
And how do you think wa spent that heur?
We spent it just raviewing old times and
talking about things that had bappened and
that liad given him many good laughs. lie
reminded me that when he went te the city
of London te becoma a greater iawyer, and
joined with Mr. Ivey-he bad been practising in Glencoe-a farmer came te him witb a
division court case and said be would like
Jack te take it. Jack went into the case and
said: "Anybody can bandle this. There is
notbhing te it. It wen't last more than ten
minutes; it doesn't amount te anything?"
But the old man scratched bis head-he had
neyer been mixed up witb law before, and
tbougbt it was a vary dangarous businessand asked Jack Elliott te take 'the case. WeIl,
Jack was nýeyer asked te do anyrtbing for a
friand that be did net do; se he went away
down te Glence on this trivial matter. Týhe
case lasted but a few minutas, and after it
was over the old man, ne doubt thinking
about baving brought a lawyer ail the way
from London, said: "Well, it was ahl rigbt.
Yenu won it, but I guess a poorar lawyer would
have done, if I could have feund ene."

SENATE

It was such buman incidents as these which
amused Jack and made him one of the greatest companions I have ever known. Even
when he was actively engaged in the practice of law in London, he always found it
possible in the summer time to corne west
and spend a month with us driving over the
prairie, looking at bis farms, and seeing the
progress that Western Canada was making;
and I have not the slightest doubt that later,
when he was a member of the Federal Government, 'he often had a better and clearer
understanding of matters affecting Western
Canada than most -of the men who had seats
This was because he did
in Parliampent.
more than visit Western Canada: ho travelled
over the country, particularly in Saskatchewan
and Alberta, and gained a sound knowledge of farming as an operator; and furthermore, ho was interested in cattle and the
progress of every line of agriculture.
Thon one day it was suggested te me that
I should look over a few of the constituencies
in the province of Ontario, up Middlesex
way, with a view to our winning back some
of them in the next general election. That
I went over one or two of

these sections, and then I called Jack Elliott
on the telephone and asked him if I could
have lunch with him. There was only one
way anyone could have lunch with Jack
Elliott, and that was to allow him to pay for
it, for ho was the most hospitable entertainer
I ever knew. After lunch, while walking
around with him, I said: "There will be a
half dozen men from West Middlesex, the real
boys, in to sec you in the next two or three
days." He said, "What are you talking
I replied, "They say you can win
about?"
the West Middlesex seat in the Commons and
that nobody else can." He said, "I always
thought you were a friend of mine." I said:
"We will not thresh this out now. You and
I know all the answers to these fool political
questions. You just see the boys when they
cone." He saw them; ho became the candidate, and was elected by a majority of over
1,300. Shortly afterwards he was taken into
the Government. and Jim Malcolm asked me
what majority Jack Elliott would have in the
by-election? I told him Jack would have
twice wiat he had had in the general election;
and when the by-election was over bis majority
was something more than 2,600. It was my
pleasure to spend five weeks with him in that
contest.
He never had any difficulty in
getting votes from people, because he never
offended anybody. He ahvays did the best ho
could for his friends. No trouble was too
great for him if it was for his friends, the
neighbours and the country folk.
Hon. Mr. MARSHALL.

If you asked Jack Elliott what bis religion
was, he always answered in two words-"Hard
shell."
Hon. Mr. DUFF: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. MARSHALL: Perhaps some honourable gentleman may need a little interpretation. I did not, because I knew the
covenanting Baptists who had come from
Scotland and settled in that community, and
wxho had their May meeting, their big meeting, year after year. In over sixty years Jack
Elliott never missed but one May meeting.
This was the gathering, so to speak, of the
clans of this little Baptist community. His
religion was as sound and true as all bis other
principles.
Jack Elliott lived the life of a bachelor. I
remember one day, after I had known him for
a year or two, when we were driving by a
cemetery and be asked me to stop. When I
did so lie stepped out of the car, went in
and stood beside a grave for a little while,
and then came out. That is the story of a
man who was faithful during life and faithful
for forty years after death. It happened a
number of times when I was in that conmunity. Such was the fidelity of the sort of
man Jack Elliott was. That explains why be
was one of the most valuable public men
Canada ever had.
One characteristic he always bad was loyalty
o bis leader. Whetber it was A. G. MacKay,
Newton Wesley Rowell or Mackenzie King,
Jaek was loyal to the man he supported. And
after all, loyalty is a priceless thing in politics,
in public life, in dealings with men, and particularly in friendship. Jack had an artful way
of dealing with friends in bis own party when
it came to loyalty to his leader. On one occasion J heard a man making some inconsiderate
remarks about the leader. Jack- stopped him
and said, "Now, would that be my leader you
are casting 'asparagus' at?"
The fellow
laughed and said, "I guess it would be." Then
Jack said: "I am like you. I don't think be
is perfect; I don't think he is alwavs right.
But xwhen I think it over I wonder how much
w orse you or I would do on bis job. I think
lie is pretty near the best." No man stood
higher in his loyalty to his party and bis
leaders than Jack Elliott. Through bis loyalty
he made friends who would stand by him
through thick and thin, for they knew how
true he was and how unafraid to be true to
his leader and bis cause. He did good work
in every Parliament in which he sat, both for
the country and bis party, and could always
give a reason for the faith that was in him.
I have spoken at some length, but I do not
apologize for so doing, for I have been speak-

JANUARY 27, 1942
ing of a man wbo stood for the finest in life,
and of whom I can confidently say, as Burns
said of a great good neighbour:
If there's another world, he lives in bliss;
If there is none, he made the best of this.
Hon. G. V. WHITE: Hanourable senators,
I desire to, associate myseif with the honourable senators wbo have already spoken, and
to express my personal sorrow at the death of
our esteemed coileague the late Senator
Horsey.
It was my privilege to have known him
quite intimatey ever since he became a member
of the Senate. For some years past, in connection with our duties as party whips, it was
necessary for me to consuit Senator Horsey
upon numerous occasions during the parliamentary sessions. I found hjm to be a genial,
courteous and kindly gentleman, always ready
to solve our problems in a fair-minded way;
and I am sure that by his passiýng this House
will be the poorer.
To his family I desire to convey my deepest
sympathy in their bereavement.
Hon, W. D. EULER: Honourable senators,
while I have no desire to delay the proceedings
of the flouse, I may be permitted to add a
very few words to wbat already has been so
well said. I speak with particular reference to
one who was a close personai friend of mine,
the late Senator Elliott, popularly and affectionately known as "Jack Elliott."
I knew Mr. Elliott for a good many years
before he came to Ottawa. He was, as has heen
said, a member of the Ontario Legisiature, and
was very well known throughout Ontario. He
later came to Ottawa and entered the Government, and I had tbe privilege of serving with
bim in two administrations, in whicb he oc-cupied successively the positions of Minister of
Labour, Minister of Public Works, and Postmaster General-posts whicb I think ail wiil
admit be filled acceptably to the people of
Canada.
My rigbt bonourable friend the leader of
the Government (Rigbt Han. Mr. Dandurand)
bas made some reference to the fact that
Senator Eiiiott, he and 1 were delegates ta
the Assembly of the later ill-fated League of
Nations in 1929. 1 recail quite well the
conversations wbicb the right honourable
leader basrmentioned. Mr. Elliott *was a deep
beliéver in and had strong convictions on the
theory-perhaps. it is not a tbeory-of
predestination. Whatever tbe merits af that
may be, I have sometimes tbougbt that
perhaps my difference of opinion with bim
arase from a faint suspicion in bis mind that
my destination was not just wbat be might
have wisbed it ta be.

il

A few weeks ago I stood, as a representative
of tbis 'body, at the graveside of Mr. Elliott ini
a littie country churcbyard about twenty miles
froma tbe city of London. He was laid to
rest there, among those of bis kmn wbo had
gone before bim, and in the presence of
bundreds of people wba bad known, respected
and believed in bim. The little country cburcb
was filled to overflowing by tbose wbo came
ta pay a ls.st tri-bute of respect and affection
to a man wbo held the confidence of perbaps
a larger proportion of constituents than do
most members of the flouse af Commons.
lis outstanding cbaracteristics, ta my mind,
were bis constant cbeerfuiness and great sense
of bumor, wbich made bim a cbarming social
companion at ail times. But more important
than these were bis complete integrity and, as
bas been mentioned by a preceding speaker,
his great loyalty ta ail witb wbom be was
associated. Perbaps 1 can pay bim no greater
tribute than to say simply that Jack Eiliott
was in every sense of the word a fine man, a
faitbful public servant, a man wbo bad no
enemies and wbo was peculiarly endowed, to
a greater degree than most of us wbo give a
good portion of our lives ta public service,
witb tbe gif t and genius for making friends.
Hon. A. D. MeRAE: Honourable senators,
I could not let tbis occasion go by
witbout paying my tribute ta the late Senator
Elliott, whom I knew longer, perbaps, than
did any other member of this flouse. We sat
on the samne bencb in public scbool some fifty
odd years ago, and I maintained more or less
close contact witb bim ever since. I regarded
Jack Elliott as a very exceptional man. Wbat
bas been said by the bonourable senatar from
Waterloo (Mr. Euler) is quite truc: be bad
no enemies. To my knowledge, Senator
Elliott neyer did anyone an injury intentionally. The resuit was that bis friends were
counted by the legion, and in my native riding
of West Middlesex, wbicb Mr. Elliott represented, and could, bave represented as long
as be wisbed, be had the support of everybody,
even of memnbers of my own family.
is way tbrough life was not easy. His
family were not blessed witb the best of
health, and the charge of tbat family rested
upon bim every day of the last haîf century.
Hie did aIl that be could for tbem, just as
faitbfully as if tbey had been bis d-irect
descendants.
I do not tbink I can better indicate the kind
of man tbat Senator Elliott was than hy saying
that bis friends came from ail classes in the
community, without distinction of party. In
the deatb of Senator Eiliott I bave lost one
of my aid associates, a friend of more than
haîf a century.

SENATE
Hon. A. K. HUGESSEN:
Honourable
senators, I hope it will not be taken amiss
if I rise to add a few words to what bas
already been said so well by senators who
have preceded me, about our late colleague.
On account of bis appointment to this Chamber being so recent I did not have the privilege
of anything more than a passing acquaintanceship with the late Senator Elliott, and I was
therefore unable to enjoy that friendship with
him which, by those who did enjoy it, will be
treasured in precious recollection.
It is rather with reference to our late friend
Senator Horsey that I wish to say a few
words this afternoon, particularly from the
point of view of one of the more recent
appointees to this Chamber. I am sure that
all honourable senators recall with a good
deal of poignancy the cînotions they experienced when introduced to this House. Those
emotions are somewhat difficult to describe,
but I think they may be compared to nothing
so much as to the feelings of a new boy
spending bis first day at a boarding school.
His surroundings are strange, and all around
him are a number of people who have a lot
more experience than he bas; so that he is
somewhat awed. What a new boy under these
conditions always remembers to the end of
bis life is the kindness of some older boy
who takes a little interest in him, is friendly
towards him and shows him the ways of the
place. When I was first appointed to this
Chamber, a little less than five years ago,
Senator Horsey was the whip on this side of
the House, and during my first few days bere,
wbile .I was trying to feel my way around, be
was kindlinecss, consideration and courtesy
personified. He made the new boy feel at
home.
You may say that is a little thing. Perhaps
it is, but it is small characteristics such as
that, characteristics of kindliness and friendship, which endoar a man to bis friends. With
Senator Horsey was
such characteristics
abundantly endowed.
He was, as all know, a strong partisan.
He was a firmn believer in the principles of
the party to which ho belonged, for which lie
worked bard and for which ho made many
sacrifices. But ho never allowed that partisanship to interfere with bis personal friendships.
and I am sure I can say without fear of
contradiction that bis loss is as deeply felt
on the other side of the House as it is on this.
His death at this time is all the more tragie
because right until the very end he appeared
to be in enjoyment of that excellent health
and that abounding vitality which had lasted
him throughouit his life, from the time when
he was a well--known athlete at Queen's
Hon. NIr. HUGES-EN

University.
The untimely passing of our
friend is a ,reminder to each one of us of how
tenuous is our hold on this mortality. It is
an echo of that phrase wrung from the heart
of Edmund Burke, in bis famous speech to
the electors of Bristol, when ho said: "Gentlemen, what shadows we are, what shadows we
pursue."
Hon. NORMAN P. -LAMBERT: Honourable
senators, I request the indulgence of my
colleaguies for a few moments, so that I may
have the privilege of adding briefly, but noce
the less genuincly and sincerely, to the tributes which have been paid this afternoon to
ou friends who have so recently left us. With
both of themn I was fortunate in having intimate, friendly relations long before entering
this Chamber. It is not so much of their
period of public life and service that I wish
to speak, as of the personal qualities which
endcared them to those who knew thei well.
As bas been said, since the late senator from
Middlesex became a member of this body he
had been so indisposed that he was unable te
leave the imprass of his real personality here.
Yet few men who have served their country in
aur1Parliament liad a closer touch with the
people, or a more affectionate attachment to
the soil froi which they were raised, than
Jolin Caimpbell Elliott. He was essentially a
son of old Ontario, a product of the rural
countryside of West Middlesex. While the
profes-sio
of law claimed him, lie iever for
a moment lest the contact with and the feeling of the Canadian Scots farm folk, in whose
midst lie spent most of lis life. To me, the
outstanding charimî of his mind and character
was his abiding interest in the pioneer life of
those people.
Many of us will associate with his memory
the receipt at the Christmas season of bis
attractive cards depicting the first schoolhouse,
the first church, or the first civic building to
be erected in seia Western Ontario comiunity, with whose history he was so intiiitely acqiuainted.
Nothing intrigued his
fancy more than to record in conversation the
familv lineage and background of almost any
know n descendant from his native countv.
Chara-terized by a dry, quaint humour, bis
narrations warc always as delightful as they
were enliglitening.
The long-standing and fast friendship with
the late Riglht Honourable Ernest Lapointe,
whose death was followed within very few days
by bis own, was to our deceased friend one of
bis warmîest human associations.
Basically,
there was much in common between them,
but no one interest lay deeper than their
comeion heritage of the Canadian soil. One
came from the older farm lands of the Lower

JANUARY 27, 1942
St. Lawrence, settled by French pioneers for
300 years; the other from the hardwood bushlands of Western Ontario. Both inherited
from their native communities the same
capacity for friendship and simple human
understanding. If there was one thing more
than another for which the late senator stood.
it was the extension of that friendship of
his with Mr. Lapointe to include all the
people of their two provinces.
His time amongst us was all too short, but
I am sure that his quiet personal influence will
long be felt in these halls.
Entirely different in type of personality
from the late Senator Elliott, yet as definite
and rich in charm of character and mind, was
my dear friend the late senator from Prince
Edward (Hon. Mr. Horsey). He was born
of the town rather than the farm, and his
productive years were spent in a pioneer
life of business adventure on the continent
of Asia. He was educated in Ottawa and in
the old city of Kingston, where splendid monuments still stand to the character and architectural skill of his father. As soon as he had
finished his education at Queen's University,
our late friend went to China to join his distinguished brother, the late Dr. E. H. Horsey
-killed some years later in most tragic circumstances at Owen Sound-in establishing
the foundations of a successful Canadian life
insurance business in the Far East.
I have a very distinct impression of him
as he was some thirty-three years ago on the
occasion of one of his return visits to the hcad
office of his company in Toronto. He was a
big, rugged, upstanding figure, clad in a
Norfolk jacket of rough tweed, and blessed
with a jovial, resonant voice, which he used
with effect, especially when bent on persuading others to his point of view. There was
about him the romance of the Oriental
traveller, and a vibrant, physical quality which
even then suggested the strong footballer he
had been in his student days. He was a good
salesman and sound business man, and in
the earlier years of this century there were
fertile fields in those rich Asiatic countries for
young men of enterprise and courage.
It was not long before our late friend
returned to Canada; to be exact, just before
the outbreak of the last war. He retired
from business and responded to a natural
impulse to enter the public life of this country,
with which he was actively associated for
more than twenty-five years.
When I came to live in Ottawa, some ten
years ago, our roads came together again and
we developed close and friendly associations.
His intimate contact with old Prince Edward
coun-ty, from which my own paternal fore-

13

bears had come, was always a bond of continual
interest. The years had effected their natural
and mellowing change in him; but beneath that
quiet, dignified and kindly manner which his
colleagues had come to associate with his
membership here, was a real taste for the more
genial and social sides of life. He had many
warin friends both in this city and in the
county from which he came, and their circle
will miss the glow of his fine nature.
His judgment in matters of business, as well
as public policy and conduct, was never far
from the mark; and I for one am glad of this
opportunity of expressing something of my
own sense of obligation for the advice I received from him and for the all too brief
friendship I was privileged to enjoy with him.
In concluding these inadequate words of
appreciation of our two colleagues I may, I
think, apply to them appropriately a felicitous
sentence which the late Lord Oxford used when
referring to the difficulty of recording impressions of those personalities which have become
nost interesting and dear to us. He said:
"There is about them a kind of bouquet which
after they are gone can never be revived."
THE GOVERNOR GENERAL'S SPEECH
ADDRESS IN REPLY

The Senate proceeded to the consideration
of His Excellency the Governor General's
Speech at the opening of the session.
Hon. DONALD MAcLENNAN rose to move
that an Address be presented to His Excellency
the Governor General to offer the humble
thanks of this House to His Excellency for the
gracious speech which he bas been pleased to
make to both Houses of Parliament.
He said: Honourable members, I believe it
is esteemed an honour to have the privilege of
moving the adoption of the Address in reply
to the Speech from the Throne, but my temperament is such that personally I would
willingly forgo the honour. I believe that it
is also a compliment to the province which the
mover represents. In this regard may I say
that I am sorry someone was not chosen whose
importance is commensurate with that of the
grand old province of Nova Scotia.
When one compares the problems uppermost in the minds of members of both Houses
of Parliament in days past with the problems
facing us to-day, most of the former seem
trivial. The Maritime Provinces, with their
coal mining, fishing and agriculture; Quebec
maintàining high tariffs, but ingenuously blaming Ontario and keeping itself in the Liberal
column; Ontario, with its high tariffs and its
factories, supporting the Tory party and
making occasional allusions to the 12th of

SENATE
Juiy; the Prairie Provinces, with their wheat,
grain elevators, wheat, and then again wheat,
summer-fallow
and wheat again; British
Columbia, with its salmon fishing traps, its
freiglit rates, and the Japanese pest-I say
that ail these varjous parts of Canada had
problems whiech neariy ail appear insignificant
to-day, wxhen the very existence of ocr euntry is ot stake. It took a war with ail its
gruesome implications te impress upon us the
fact that xvhat affects one part of this
Dominion affects the whele and should interest
every Canadian, ne motter in whichi province
he may reside. I do net believe that aey one
of us ever faced Parliament svhen the very
existence of our country was in such imminent
danger as it is in to-day. The Huns, who
seem te be possessed with the spirit of evil,
from the lowest depths of the iowest depths,
are at our gates on the Atlantic; the Japanese,
who equai if they do net surpass the Nazis in
perfidy, are on our Pacifie ceast.

We in Canada are stout critics, but I surmise that the mast lusty critics amangst us
inwardly take pardonable pride in Canada's
war effort.
O wad some power the giftîe gie us
To see oursel's as ithers sce us!
If the Press off other cauntries and the
utterances off their public men may be taken
as a standard by which ta measure aur war
achievemenýt, I should be perffectly happy ta
have the Canadýian people sec themselves as
others sec them.
In ahl sincerity I think that Canada was
fortunate in having aur present Prime Minister at the hcad off affairs wlien war ýbroke out.
By lis inimitable methods off approaci lie
paved the way for hiarmony and friendship
between Canada and the United States and
brouglit abaut an officiai visit ta Canada by
President Roosevelt, wlo an that occasion made
a momentous pronauncement as ta the attitude
the United States would take if danger
threatened this country. Thc Prime Minister
led Canadia into war without a rifft anywhere
fromn thc Atlantic ta the Pacifie, and when
a rift was thought ta lie created, lie, with
the aid sa nobly given by that great Canadian,
thc Marshal Ney off peace-time, the late Right
Honaurable Ernest Lapointe, and athers,
effectually squelched thc menace. Furthermorc,
his wisdom. in handling aiffairs off great
importance facilitated, 1 'believe, thc memarable Atlantic meeting and thc visit ta thc
United States and Canada off aur super-liera.
Honourable senatars ail knaw ta whom I
refer.
It is a far cry fromn tlie attitude off thc
President of the United States in 1904 ta that
off the President off the UJnited States to-day.
I believe, and I think history will have it so,
that th-is change off attitude is in great measure
due ta aur Prime Minister.
The Speech ffram the Thrane says that we
are ta have a plebiscite asking tlie peoiple off
Canada ta release bath the Liberal and the
Conservative parties from thc plcdge solemnly
given by their leaders, during the election
campaign in 1940, that there would lie noa conscription off men for service beyond our
borders. It is said týhat circumstanees -have
clianged ta such an extent since 1940 that the
promisors can totally ignare the promise they
made. Sa far as I know, there was no objec-

l5

lion raised at the time to the making of such
a promise. I agree that circumstances have
Sa changed ffrom what they were wlien the
promise was made that it should no longer be
bdnding. I d-o flot agree, however, that the
promisors can release tliemselves froim their
promise. The anly ones who can release thema
are the pramisees, the people of Canada. If I
give a pramissory note and, for some cause
which seems sufficient to me, I do not want to
pay it, the promisee may nat agree with me.
He can bring me into court, and if I arn
released from my promise at ail, I must be
released by the court. The Government is
appcalýing to the highest court in the land-the
people-to be releiased fromn this promise. 1
sec that a section of the Press pontifically
asserts that this plebiscite will cost $3,000,000.
It is worth far more than that amount to have
uur publie men keep their word ta the people.
It is said that President Hadley, off Yale,
once upon a time discovered that the students
were flot attending Sunday services in as
great numbers as he tbought desirable; Sa he
resorted to the expedient of calling to Yale
ail the *mast famous preachers in the land to
preach ta the students. On one occasion lie
invited the famous divine, Dr. Lyman Alibot,
ta corne ta Yale. The doctor a n Sunday
marning asked the President, "How long arn
I supposed ta speak?" The President rcplied:
"You can speak as long as you want ta. 0f
course, there is a tradition at Yale that no
souls are saved affter the first twenty minutes."
Some Hon. SENATOIIS: Oh, Oh.
Hon. Mr. MAcLENNAN: Naw that my
twenty minutes are almost up, I may say in
conclusion that no Gavernment can go aliead
faster than the people will follow. It is well
known by the people af Canada that under
aur fformn off government the mai arity must
gaverfi; but no minarity need fear any undue
pressure by the majarity in a democratie
country, especially in Canada. We went inta
this war offaur awn free ýwilI. We are fighting
as ffree -men ta maintain freedom. Although
at times the military strengtli and the successes
off the enemy may appal us, we know that
from day ta day we are gaining in military
strength, and that we have a vast store off
spiritual strength which, in the final analysis,
will be the deciding factor in securing victary
for us and for aur allies-a strength of which
our enemies are nat aware, and which if they
were, they could flot understand.
Hanaurable members of the Senate, I
believe that when this war is over and won
Canada's war achievement and lier contribution
towards victory will be off such magnitude that
even the ranks off Tuscany can scarce forbear
ta cheer.

and that of our Allies-Great Britain, the
United States and all the peoples who at our
side are waging the good fight to deliver the
world from the scourge of Hitlerism, the
Fascist yoke and the Japanese hordes.
And- it is precisely because the Canadian
Covernment wishes to be enabled to adopt
freely all measures essential to the success
of our arms-subject, of course, to control by
the two Houses of this Parliament-it is for
that reason that the Government intends to
seek from the people, by means of a plebiscite,
release from any past commitments restricting
the methods of raising men for military service. Let us note first, honourable senators,
that such a course of action is essentially
democratic and that it is the only one consistent with the Liberal doctrine expounded by
Sir Wilfrid Laurier in the last days of his life.
This war is indeed the concern of the whole
Canadian people; after all, our great body of
citizens bear the heaviest load in giving generously of their blood as well as of their money.
It does not behoove a few individuals, however powerful they may be, to release the
Government from the promises made by the
Ministers to the electorate, promises which,
by the way, were made not only in Quebec,
but in the whoie country. No, only the iree
men and women of our Canadian democracy
have the right to decide their own and their
children's fate. That is a most serious matter,
involving the fulfilment of a pledge and the
salvation of our country through the preservation of our national unity and the preventing
of a recurrence, still quite avoidable, of the
unfortunate strife that existed in 1917.
I am quite convinced that the Canadian
people will feel it their duty to place their
confidence in the Government by giving it a
free hand to act according to our best national
interests as regards recruiting, and by appraising, without any undue hindrance, the necessities that may eventually arise.
Only thus shall we be able to maintain
perfect harmony in this beautiful country.
And this internal harmony which we all so
eagerly desire brings to my mind a universally
and justly apprecia.ted utterance by the statesman who now, with so much distinction, represents the Government in this Chamber. He
once said at Geneva, before the League of
Nations:
In our endeavours, we aim at maintaining
peace between nations at their boundaries, but
it should not be forgotten that for such a
purpose peace must be maintained internally,
because every legitimate grievance of a
minority descended from some neighbouring
nation has serious repercussions in the mother
nation that witnesses the oppression of her
minority. A people's greatest standard of

17

civilization is to be found in the treatment
meted out by the majority to the minorities
that are at its mercy.
In another statement, our representative in
Geneva, a former President of the League of
Nations, appealed to majorities, urging them
to deal so generously with minority groups
so as to make thein forget that they constitute
a minority. Here in Canada, the minority to
which I belong lives alongside a majority that
shows itself tolerant and respectful of our
rights. Jn this respect for our language, our
culture, our faith and all our institutions lies
the best guarantee of our survival. Nowhere
outside the free commonwealth of British
nations could we find an environment more
favourable to our natural development. This
safeguarding of our rights implies serious
obligations on our part. Every one among
us is in duty bound to contribute as much as
he can towards ensuring the triumph of our
arms. And of course we all should look upon
the salvation of our country from a truly
national standpoint, putting aside for the time
being our disagreements on less essential
matters. It is as Canadians, and only as
such, without any consideration of province,
!anguage or religious creed, that we must unite
like brothers in order ta save, while there is
still time, our national territory now coveted
by the aggressor, to safeguard also the ideal of
justice and freedom which we have inherited
from our two great mother countries, and
which we are resolved to maintain jealously
and to continue to develop freely in this free
]and of America whieh belongs to our Canadian
democracy.
Allow me, honourable senators, in describing the spirit of justice and freedom that is
now the cornerstone of the British Empire, to
quote a splendid thought expressed by that
great statesman from South Africa, General
Smuts. With this quotation I now begin a
few remarks in English.
(Text): Honourable senators. in 1917 that
great South African statesman, General Smuts,
spoke as follows:
The BritishEmpire, or this British Commonwealth of Nations, does not stand for unity,
standardization, or assimilation or denationalization, but it stands for a fuller, a richer, and
more various life among all the nations that
compose it. And even nations who have fought
you, like my own. must feel that they and their
interests, their language, their religions, and
all their cultural interests are as safe and
secure under the British flag as those of the
children of your household and your own blood.
In Canada, we enjoy the fullest measure of
religious freedom. Those who, like myself,
belong to the French-speaking minority are
at perfect liberty to develop the culture which
we have inherited from France, but which we

18

SENATE

have duly adapted to our Canadian surroundings. We are sure that all our rights are at
present more secure under the Union Jack
than under any foreign flag. And because it
is so, because we enjoy here justice and
freedom, we realize that it is essential for
the survival of our country and of our own
race to win this war at any cost. We are
anxious to continue to enjoy the esteem of
all the free citizens of the world, in particular
of our English-speaking fellow-countrymen.
When the history of this second world war
shall be written, we want the spirit of sacrifice
and the patriotism of French Canada to be
considered as worthy of our glorious past.
Let me add that up to the present the record
of French-speaking Canadians compares favourably with that of the rest of the Dominion.
I am confident that our part in this great
struggle will never cease to be equal to that
of our fellow Canadians. For this purpose,
I am sure, every one in this House realizes
the importance of preserving our national
unity; indeed, it is absolutely essential to the
successful prosecution of our war effort.
National unity is the basis and the barometer
of the morale of our Canadian people, and
victory will belong to the nations whose
morale is superior, as well as their fighting
forces and material equipment.
It is precisely in the name of national
unity that our Government has decided, to
appeal to the people by means of a plebiscite.
f believe very sincerely that this course is the
only democratic method to end the present
controversy concerning conscription for overseas service. I am absolutely convinced that
this plebiscite is the only way to maintain
our national unity. Without such a reference
to tihe country at large, the enactment of conscription for overseas service would cause all
over Canada much harm-more harm than
could be offset by any number of men it
might bring into the army.
Personally, I arm of opinion that our Government shouîld be given authority, if it
deems it necessary, to enforce military service
outside Canada. As you know, under the
legislation now in force, it is only those w-ho
have voluntarily enlisted for active service
who can be called upon to serve outside our
territorv, and this limitation would include
even Newfo.undland and Labrador, the United
States and Alaska. If a day should ever come
when the threat of attack or invasion must
be met outside the borders of Canada-for
instance, somewhere in the United States-I
am sure that all true Canadians clearily intend that resistance be offered, totally and
anywhere, against the invaders, whether they
come from the East or from the West. For
this reason, I consider it my duty to ask our
Hon. Mr. GOUIN.

good people to renew their confidence in our
Government, and to relieve our Ministers
from any of their previous commitments. I
am confident that we shall not appeal in vain
to the patriotic spirit of our courageous
population. We are proud to ive in a democracy where freedom and justice still reign
supreme, and once the Canadian nation has
spoken, that verdict-and J have no doubt
about it-will be acce.pted without hesitation.
Those who, like myself, have always tried
to promote a better understanding between
English-speaking and Frenoh-speaking Canadians want to assure you, as solemnly as we
can, that our fellow-countrymen are willing
to make any sacrifice to save this country
from our enemies. But such total sacrifice
must be asked in the name of Canada, and
only a plebiscite can satisfy the majority of
my race that by the clearly expressed will of
our nation, speaking as a whole, compulsory
service outside our territory may be enforced
should it -become necessary.
Such is the
attitude of most French Canadians and of a
large number of other Canadians. In the
light of past events that attitude is in no way
unreasonable. It would be a great mistake to
ignore it and not take it into account. At
that price national unity can be saved, and
certainly it is not too high a price to pay
after the sad experiments of 1917.
Honouraible senators, I have stated my
views very frankly because it is only through
such frankness that we can secure the full and
cordial co-operation which must unite all the
different groups of our population and all
the various parts of our immense country. I
hope very sincerely that you wili take my
remarks in good part, because it is in a spirit
of conciliation that I have spokenSome Hon. SENATORS:

Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. GOUIN: -trying to be faithful
to the lessons of moderation and toleration
for those of other races than my own, which
I have learned from Laurier and from my
own father-whom so many of you knew and
who was a friend of so many members of
this and the other House-and from our
I have also learned this
Prime Minister.
lesson from his associate, from the great
Canadian whose untimely death a few weeks
ago was such a terrible loss to all Canada,
that champion of the sacred cause of national
unity: the Right Hon. Ernest Lapointe.
It is a great privilege for me to second
the Address, which has been so eloquently
moved by the honourable senator from Margaree Forks (Hon. Mr. MacLennan), for I
believe very sincerely that in this manner I

JANUARY 27, 1942
can in a modest way help to preserve our
national unity, -the preservation of which has
never been more important in our history.
Hon. C. C. BALLANTYNE: Honourable
senators, my first pleasant duty is to congratulate heartily the mover and the seconder of the
Address. They both acquitted themselves very
eloquently, and in a manner fitting to the
occasion. I was particularly interested in the
remarks of my good friend from De Salaberry
(Hon. Mr. Gouin). He is a worthy son of
his distinguished father.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: He is still a
very young man, and we look for very great
things from him in the days to come.
Honourable senators, as a rule I do not make
use of a manuscript when addressing this
Chamber, but this is an occasion of such
importance that I feel it necessary for me to
do so. I have never addressed this House
with more timidity than I do at this moment,
when, owing to the fact that our gifted and
brilliant leader the Right Honourable Arthur
Meighen has resigned his seat in the Senate
of Canada to lead the Conservative party in
the House of Commons, I find myself for the
time being in the position of acting leader.
I therefore crave the indulgence of honourable senators. I intend not to make a partisan
or provocative speech, but to deal with the
serious wat situation as I see it, and as
I think the majority of the Canadian people
see it.

Let us face the facts. When this Government in January, 1940, scuttled Parliament,
giving a great shock not only to Parliament,
but to the Canadian people, a general election followed. At that time Mr. King and
the members of his Government pledged themselves that there would never be conscription
in Canada, and since then the Prime Minister
has toured Western Canada and reiterated that
statement over and over again. When. the
general election was held, the King Government was returned with a very large majority; but it must be borne in mind that a
large number of Conservatives voted Liberal
because they felt it unwise to change the
Government at that time. In January the war
was called a "phoney" war, and the armies of
France and England remained virtually inactive before the Maginot line. Then the
powerful German army invaded Denmark,
Norway, Holland and Belgium, and France
collapsed, and all of these countries came under
the Nazi heel of oppression. Then followed
the invasion of Greece and Yugoslavia, and
last December, Japan, without warning,
attacked Pearl Harbour and the United States'

19

Philippines. Our powerful and friendly neighbour then came into the war on the side
of the British Empire, Russia and China.
From this brief review honourable members
will see that serious events have occurred since
the election was held in 1940, and that these
have completely changed the whole war situation. I think it is only fair to the Government
to state that many of the Government's policies
have been most commendable. At the same
time I maintain that we are not waging an
all-out war, as the Government claims, and
later on in my remarks I shall state what I
think ought to be done to make it an all-out
war.
In what position does the Government find
itself to-day? The United States, as soon as
they entered the war, called to their armed
forces all men from 19 to 44, and put into
effect compulsory service in any part of the
war zone, and some of their gallant forces
are at this very moment in Northern Ireland.
The great necessity for the successful prosecution of the war to-day is man-power.
According to the Hon. Mr. Howe, Minister of
Munitions and Supply, in so far as Canada is
concerned it is no longer a question of munitions and war equipment; and a short time ago
he made a statement that an overseas unit
could be fully equipped in six weeks. He also
said that Canada would send tanks, guns, trucks
and munitions to Russia, China, Great Britain
and to our forces in the Middle East. The
majority of the public to-day are demanding
two things, a National Government and compulsory service-compulsory service of men and
women on the farms, in the munitions plants
and in any other productive industry where
they can best serve, and conscription of single
men from the ages of 19 to 30 for overseas
service.
The Government no doubt has considered
this serious and, I might say, unprecedented
situation, for it has decided to hold a plebiscite. What for? There is only one answer.
It is to free the Government from the pledge
made by it that there would be no conscription,
and to give the Government a free hand to
carry out in its own way any policy it deems
proper.
It would appear to me that there were two
strong and patriotic stands that the Government could have taken in placing this question
before the Canadian people. First, it could
have said: "The Government does not believe
in the principle of conscription, and is opposed
to it; it has decided, therefore, to continue on
the voluntary basis." Or, second, it could
have said: "The serious exigencies of the war

20

SENATE

are such that our pledge of no conscription no
longer liolds good, and we are in favour of
selective compulsorv service in Canada and
overseas." But the Government apparently did
not wish to take a strong stand either one way
or the other, and it is therefore going to put
this country to the great expense of $1,500,000
siiply to free itself from its "no conscription"
pledge, and to enable it to proceed in as free
a manner as it may decide.
In another place last evening Mr. King
quoted part of a speech of the Right Hon.
Winston Churchill in an endeavour to convey
the impression that in the United Kingdom
they did nat have compulsory service for the
placing of men and women where they could
best serve. We know, on the contrary, however, that they have compulsory service for all
women fron 20 to 30, and for all men, either
of military age or over age, by which to place
thent where they can best serve. Let me quote
what Mr. Churchill said:
There is no room now for fthe dilettante, for

the weakling, for the shirker or the sluggard.
The mine. the factory, the dockyard. the salt
sea waves. the lields to til]. thmehome, the

hospital, the chair of the scientist, tli pulpit
of the preacher-from the highest to the
humblest, the tasks all are of equal lonour.
All have their part ta play.
The enemies ranged against us, coalesced and
combined against us, have asked for total war.
Let us make sure that they get it.
These statements were applauded by members of the House of Commons. The applause
throughout the country was even louder and
more enthusiastie.
The Prime Minister of Quebec, Mr. King's
chief lieutenant, made a speech in Montreal
last niglît as follows:
We are facing two groups, Meighen and
Mackenzie King. Meighen bas always been for
conscription for overseas service. We have Mr.
King, who has always been against conscription.
. . . We have at the head of the Liberal party
Mr. King, who is an anti-conscriptionist. . . .
Mr. King is against conscription. He has always
been. His mentality and that of all his party
are hie best guarantees. We have on the other
hand a man who fathered conscription in
1917. . .. .

Mr. King has said: "We will find

out what is the sentiment of the Canadian
people." . . . If lie asks the Canadian people,
"Are you in favaur of conscription or against,
conscription?" and the Canatian people say
"Yes," what can he do? Listen to me. . . .
I don't know what the answer would be, but
Mr. King would be pledged to impose conscription or resign and bc replaced by Meigben,
whereas, tbe way Mackenzie King puts tho
question, he remains free to use his own
patriotic judgment. . . . England bas no need
of soldiers. Mackenzie King knows that England
has no need of soldiers. What England needs
is munitions and food. . . . If Canadians have

any doubts of Mackenzie King, and replace him
by Meighen, then conscription would come for
Hon.

Mr. BALLANTYNE.

the men, and not for wealth. . . . I am against
conscription. I do not think it necessary for
overseas service. I think that conscription for
overseas service would be a crime now.
Let me return to the proposed plebiscite.
Mr. King has given the answer that it cannot
be held for less than the great cost of $1,500,000,
and he says he only wants to be relieved of
his pledge, and then to do as lie likes in the
further conduct of the war. Surely such indecision will not appeal to the Canadian people
or our Allies.. nor will itnrease the prestige
of Canada. Therefore I plead with the Government to drop it.
The war situation now demands that two
imiperative tiings should bc donc. First, a
NationaI Government should be formed.
Wlien this question is mentioned sonie people
a-k, "
on liave vou in Pailiament who
would bring strength to the present GovernM
ment?"
y replv is: we liave soie very
good men in all the Opposition groups, and
in addition to them ithe Government would
be well advised to go outside Parlianient and
induce five or six of the most able executives
Io join a National Goverinent.
Total war
effort cannot be carried out by a party government. no matter whether it be Conservative
or Liberal. In order that Canada may be
able to put forvard her full effort in this
wiar we rWequire a non-party government and
these two policies: first, selective compulsory
service for Canada and overseas; secondly,
selective compulsory service for men who can
blst serve in Canada.
Voluîntary recruiting has broken down, as
it did in 1916. If our gallant soldiers who are
now in England had been in action, we could
not have reinforced them. Our gallant forces
sent to Hong Kong have been in action and
have given a good accounit of themselves, as
Canadians always do, and we fear there have
been great losses. The Minister of National
Defence states that we require seven thousand
men each month to reinforce our army in
England, and we have not been able to get
this number. What position should we be in
if our men were in action, suffering heavy
easualtics, and we were unable to reinforce
iiemi?

Let us turn our memories back to the 1917
situation, which I was sorry to hear the
honourable senator from De Salaberry (Hon.
Mr. Gouin) refer to as sad. In 1917 Sir
Robert Borden was confronted by the same
situation as we have now. Let us note the
courageous and strong stand he took at that
time. The Military Service Act was passed,
and Sir Robert decided there should be a
National Union Government. Quite a few of
his own party followers were against it, and
he told me himself that he said to them at a

JANUARY 27, 1942

caucus of the party, "If you do not want me
as Prime Minister, I will resign for anyone you
would like to have take my place." That was
a very strong stand, and the Conservative
members showed their good judgment by not
making any change. Then, what was his first
action? He called for the resignation of all his
Ministers and took in nine prominent Liberals.
Six of this number had never been in the
Federal Parliament before, and when they
came into the Government he had to drop
old and faithful followers.
Conscription and National Government in
1917, notwithstanding erroneous statements
made to the contrary, maintained our Army
Corps of 80,000 men at full strength at the
front, as well as all the other units: railway,
labour, transport, medical and others. In
addition, large reserves were always held for
reinforcements. Let me point out that the
British were so short of man-power at that
time that they had to reduce the number of
brigades in their infantry divisions from four
to three, whereas Canada maintained her four
brigades and kept all her divisions and her
army corps up to full strength.
This is an answer as well to a statement
which Hon. Mr. Crerar, my friend and former
colleague, made some time ago in Toronto.
He said that after a quarter of a century he
was not so sure that conscription was really
effective; that he had voted for it in 1917 and
would vote for it now if he thought it was
necessary. How Mr. Crerar and Mr. Godbout
can come to the conclusion that men are not
wanted now, when there are such terrifie
battles raging in the jungles of Malaya and
in North Africa, as well as in certain portions
of Australia, I cannot understand. Would
not General Auchinleck like to get a few
And would not the British in
divisions?
Malaya, or the Australians, like the same
thing?
I desire now to reiterate what my leader,
the Right Honourable Mr. Meighen, stated
some time ago, when defining the policy of the
Conservative party. He said that the Conservative party would aid the Government to
the fullest extent, either inside the Government or outside.
Honourable senators, I have nothing more to
say at this time, except to ask the Government not to proceed with the proposed plebiscite. Drop it, and face the facts.
Right Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND: Honourable senators, my honourable friend (Mr.
Ballantyne) states the Prime Minister, his
colleagues and members of the House, who
were elected after making a pledge to the
people, a pledge which was supported by Dr.
Manion, my honourable friend's own leader

21

at the time, should disregard that pledge and
extend the present policy of conscription for
service in Canada to include conscription for
service abroad. He must have heard what
was said at a famous dinner in Toronto by
Dr. Nickle, who sat for a number of years in
the House of Commons and who later became
Attorney-General for Ontario in a Conservative cabinet. Dr. Nickle said he could not
believe that a government, after appealing to
the country and being returned on a certain
policy, would disregard that policy without
going back to the people. That statement by
Dr. Nickle, of Kingston, whose career I have
followed with interest, should cause my honourable friend opposite to have some doubt
as to the wisdom of the contrary policy he now
advocates.
The honourable gentleman mentioned a
speech delivered yesterday by Mr. Godbout,
the Prime Minister of Quebec. I read a report
of that speech in two newspapers and I found
nothing in it against the plebiscite as proposed. Mr. Godbout said some time ago that
if he thought it was absolutcly necessary to
have conscription in order to win the war
he would vote for conscription, and last night
or the night before he stated he did not believe
that conscription was required at present. The
Prime Minister of Canada said something to
the same effect in the other House. He does
not know whether there may not be .coming a
moment when lie may need a freer hand, but,
in the speech which my honourable friend has
before him, he declared he did not feel that
the time for adopting conscription had yet
come.
We are now facing a request that conscription be extended to include service abroad.
But there is in the way an impediment that
strikes everybody, namely, the vote of the
people in 1940. My honourable friend should
not be surprised because the Prime Minister
and his Government have decided to follow
a course dictated by honesty and honour, nor
should he be indignant because it seems to
him there is need for a change in the Government's policy. He seems to forget that before
Japan began hostilities the Australian Government officially declared it would not propose
conscription for service abroad. The Government of that country had in mind what
happened in 1916 and 1917.
In 1916 a
referendum in favour of conscription abroad
was submitted to the Australian people, and
rejected. The next year another submission was
made, and Mr. Hughes, the then Prime Minister, declared that if the referendum were
rejected he would resign. By that time Great
Britain had turned many a sharp corner and
was, as my honourable friend stated, in dire

SENATE
need of men, yet Australia, whose people were
one hundred per cent of British stock, turned
down this second referendum also. What is
more, a majority of Australian soldiers in
Europe voted against the referendum.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: May I interrupt
my right honourable friend for a moment?
The Prime Minister was careful to differentiate
between a referendum and a plebiscite. He
said a referendum would commit the Government, but a plebiscite would not.
Right Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I am
speaking of Mr. Hughes, the former Prime
Minister of Australia. Is my honourable
friend referring to him?
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: No; to our own
Prime Minister.
Right Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
different matter.

That is a

Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: My right honourable friend said that a referendum had
been taken in Australia. I was merely pointing out that in the opinion of the Prime
Minister of Canada there is a great deal of
difference between a referendum and a plebiscite. A referendum binds the Government, but
a plebiscite does not. Australia submitted a
referendum to the people, not a plebiscite.
Right Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The point
I am making is that a majority of the people
in Australia, and of the Australian soldiers
in the trenches in Europe, voted against the
referendum. As to the difference between a
referendum and a plebiscite, of course I know
exactly what it is. The Government had a
right to choose which of the two methods it
would employ to appeal to the people, and it
chose a plebiscite.
My honourable friend takes umbrage at
an aspersion made by the honourable seconder
of the Address (Hon. Mr. Gouin) with regard
to the 1917 election. This is not the moment
for referring to that election, or the legislation that preceded it. I told the Right Hon.
Mr. Meighen in this Chamber that any day
that he would like to discuss 1917, I should
be ready to go thoroughly into it. But I
added this to him, that it was not because of
conscription that he had been swept away
from the province of Quebec in the elections
that followed, but rather because of the legislation which he had brought about, which
permitted ballot-box stuffing
and ballot
switching to be done so openly that everyone
could read as he ran. The right honourable
gentleman was called to account and condemned for the legislation which he prepared,
by which he loaded the dice and carried the
Right Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

election. My honourable friend was not a
member of the other House at that time.
Two members of the Opposition, Liberals,
called the Act infamous legislation, but when
they were faced with the fact that if they
remained in opposition the Act would
absolutely prevent their being re-elected, they
gave in and walked into the Union Government. But all this is past history. We know
what took place, and how it is that the province
of Quebec rose unanimously against the
Meighen Government in 1921, 1925 and 1926.
My honourable friend knows that his leader,
the Right Hon. Mr. Meighen, went to
Hamilton and declared that if he were Prime
Minister he would never allow Canadian
soldiers to be sent abroad without the people
being first consulted. Of course in these days
the situation is much more difficult and much
more serious, but that is the principle he laid
down; and my honourable friend will realize
that the view held" by a considerable number
of people on this question has been shared not
only by the Right Hon. Mr. Meighen, but by
Dr. Manion, the leader of the Conservative
party in the 1940 general election. I had not
intended to revert to this question. It leads
nowhere, and the time for recrimination is, I
think, past.
I desire to congratulate the honourable
senator from Margaree Forks (Hon. Mr.
MacLennan) and my young friend-I say
young, and yet his hair begins to change
colour-the honourable senator from De
Salaberrv (Hon. Mr. Gouin) upon the excellent
pronouncements we have heard from them.
The honourable member from De Salaberry
hmppens to be of the third generation of a
family with whose members I have worked
very closely, two of them premiers of their
yrovince, Hon. Mr. Mercier and Hon. Mr.
Gouin. I find sometimes I am seated among
four generations-which at my age is not
very surprising. I am delighted to see a
descendant of those two men standing here
and doing honour to their names.
In his statement before the House of
Commons yesterday the Prime Minister gave
a complete review of the activities and policies
pursued by the Government since the declaration of war, and outlined its programme for
1942-43. I need not cover the same ground,
for all honourable members have before them
the House of Commons Hansard containing
that statement. I will limit myself to a few
points which in my opinion need to be
stressed and which refer to the Government's
policy of the past and of to-day.
From the outset the Government has been
bent upon exerting all its efforts in every
direction to meet total war. We have national
selective service which we can apply by

JANUARY 27, 1942
compulsion. There is only one limitation
recognized-that compulsion is not used as a
method of raising men for military service
overseas. Our forces for overseas service are
not confined to one branch only, as was mostly
the case in the last war. They include men
en-listed in the Canadian Navy and the Canadian Air Force, as well as those enlisted in the
Canadian Active Army. In Great Britain,
as in Canada, compulsion is not used to raise
men for the Navy and the Air Force.
. In this connection, I think my honourable
friend is in error when lie states that yesterday
Mr. King said Great Britain had not conscription for this war, or something of the
kind. The Right Hon. Mr. King never said
anything of the kind. His statement is in the
hands of all honourable members, and my
honourable friend will not find in it any such
assertion with regard to military service.
In the Navy and the Air Force men who
have volunteered> exceed the number it has
been possible to accept for immediate service.
The issue is thus narrowed to overseas service
in the Army. It relates only to a few contingencies, as up to the present time the Army
has secured necessary recruits on a voluntary
basis. And that is where again I differ with
my honourable friend. Up to the present all
the services have been provided for under the
voluntary system.
So the Prime Minister
and Mr. Godbout himself are perfectly free to
say that there is no need to-day for recruiting
otherwise than under the voluntary system,
because that system has not broken down.
Now I put the question: What is the total
war effort of a nation?
It involves two
fundamentals. The first of these is devotion
to the prosecution of the war of all the
available energies and resources of the nation
in excess of those required to maintain the
health and efficiency of the people.
The
second-and it is of equal importance-is a
proper balance in the use of these energies and
resources for the manifold needs of war. A
total effort, for example, would not be achieved
if so many men were enlisted in the armed
forces, at sea, on land, and in the air, that
there were not enough men left on the farms to
feed them. In the same way, a total effort
would not be achieved if so many men were
enlisted that not enough were left in the
factories to provide them with the necessary
ships, planes, tanks, guns and ammunition.
Moreover, modern war has shown that an
army, and equally a navy, is dependent upon
adequate air support. A total effort therefore
cannot be made unless the right balance is
achieved among all branches of the armed
forces. These examples could be multiplied

indefinitely. Indeed, the most difficult task
in total war is to decide the correct balance
between different aspects of the war effort.
Moreover, the appropriate balance of one
country would seldom, if ever, be appropriate
for another. Germany, for example, is able
to raise an exceptionally large army because
she can draw on the enslaved populations for
war production and food. Britain, likewise, is
in a position proportionately to increase her
armed forces to a greater degree than Canada,
because Canada requires men to help feed and
arm Britain, as well as to feed and arm our
own country.
The foundation of the total effort of any
country is a correct decision as to the minimum requirements of the civilian population.
Once those are determined, production and
consumption, except for war, must be steadily
and progressively cut down to the minimum.
Waste must be eliminated; the manufacture
of all luxuries and many comforts must cease.
The surplus of man-power and resources thus
secured must be used to make war. In using
this surplus it is vital that it be developed in
the right way. It is net enough to create a
navy, an army, and an air force; the sailors,
soldiers and airmen must be fed, clothed and
armed; they must be moved to the area of
combat, and communications must be maintained; reinforcements of men and supplies
All this requires
must be kept flowing.
the most careful planning and detailed
organization.
Honourable members will sec in the Prime
Minister's statement the various aspects of
the total effort. My honourable friends have
a general knowledge of the accomplishments
of our National Defence departments-Army,
Air and Navy. I will give some interesting
figures in that direction, but first I desire to
lay before the Senate our financial effort in
helping out the United Kingdom, which Prime
Minister Churchill has highly commended, and
with which the Senate may be less familiar.
The extent to which Canada has been
furnishing supplies to Britain is, I am sure,
not fully realized by our own people. Canada
has supplied weapons and munitions to Britain
for the use of Britain's armed forces, and for
other Allied forces for which Britain has
undertaken to provide equipment. Canada has
also supplied to Britain raw materials required
in British war production and food-stuffs required to feed the armed forces and the people
of Britain. In other words, Canada is, at one
and the same time, a full partner in the war
in lier own right and one of the principal
arsenals, granaries and shipyards for Britain,

24

SENATE

other parts of the Commonwealth and other
of the Allied nations. The total volume of
Canadian shipments to Britain since the commencement of the war compares favourably
with the volume which thus far has moved
froi the United States.
Canadian financial assistance to Britain has
been necessary in connection with the provision
of these vast quantities of war supplies. The
financial assistance which Canada has extended
to Britain is, of coures, not what is ordinarily
understood by the use of that term. Canada
does not ship money across the Atlantic;
the money itself never, in fact, leaves Canada.
Canadian financial assistance has been extended
to Britain in the following manner. The British
Government bas purchased war supplies from
Canadian producers. Britain, however, has not
had enough Canadian dollars with which te
make payment for the greater part of these
supplies. Payment bas accordingly been made
in pounds sterling. This English money has
remained on deposit in London, because it
cannot, of course, he uscd in Canada. Mo-t
of the Canadian money required to pay the
producers of guns and copper and bacon and
other commodities has been supplied by the
Canadian Gov ernment. This Canadian money
has had to be raised froin the Canadian people
in taxes, war sav-ings or war loans.
Canada's financial aid to Britain has, in
other words, amounted to this: the Minister of
Finance has raised money in taxes and loans
fron the Canadian people to pay Canadian
producers for ships, tanks, guns, planes and
other munitions shipped overseas for the
British Army, Na vy and Air Force; also to
pay Canadian producers for aluminum, copper,
steel, timber and other raw materials needed
for British war industry, and, as well, to pay
Canadian farmers and fishermen for the food
Canada bas sent oxerseas to feed the British
people.
The British Government has been able to
acquire some Canadian money as a result of
ordinary business transactions, such as the sale
of Brilish exports to Canada and receipts from
interest and dividends on Canadian securities.
This money has been used to pay for a part
of the British purchases. But British experts
to Canada are necessarily on a diminishing
scale.
In the early months of the war the British
Government had a considerable accumulation
of gold and was able to use some gold to pay
for war supplies received from Canada. The
British Government acquired some additional
Canadian money by an arrangement to have
Canada huy back from Britain certain Canadian Government and Government-guaranteed
Righit Hon.

Ir. DANDIXURAND.

securities held in Britain. For the most part,
however, payment for Canadian supplies has
of necessity been made in pounds sterling.
For the past year Britain has urgently
required from Canada vast quantities of
munitions and supplies. These Canada has
created the capacity to produce. The Canadian
producers have been paid in Canadian money
by the Canadian Government. Canada, in
turn, bas been credited on the books of
Britain with English money, which, however,
cannot be spent in Canada.
In this way
Canada's surplus store of English money has
been assuming larger and larger proportions.
What, in effect, all this really means is that
Britain has a steadily growing war debt to
Canada.
We all remember the international problems
and difficulties caused after the last war by
the existence of huge war debts owed by one
government to another.
We recall how
reluctant nations were to aecept payment from
other nations in the only way in which a huge
external debt can really be settled, that is by
remeoving tariffs and accepting payment in
goods. We know that buge external debts
created suspicion and bitterness between
nations.
The Government is desirous of
avoiding the creation of similar difficulties in
the post-war relations between Britain and
Canada. We believe that difficulties would
be avoided and, at the same time, the real
extent of Canada's wartime contribution would
be more fully comprehended, if Canada's
financial
arrangements with
the
United
Kingdoi, both for the past and the reasonably foreseeable future, were duly clarified.
We believe that the time has come for this
clarification.
The Government accordingly is proposing
to the British Government that the financial
arrangements between Canada and Britain
should be placed on a new footing. The offer
which is being made is one which we have
reason to believe will be warmly welcomed by
the British Government.
In so far as past transactions are concerned,
the proposal is to convert the major portion
of the pounds sterling which have accumulated
to Canada's credit in London into a loan to
the United Kingdom of seven hundred million
dollars in Canadian money. It is proposed
that during the war the loan will be reduced
by the proceeds of any sales, made to persons
outside the United Kingdom, of Canadian
dollar securities now held by residents of the
United Kingdom, and also by the proceeds
of the redemption or repayment of any
Canadian securities
held in the United
Kingdom.
The new loan would not bear

JANUARY 27. 1942
interest during the war. It is proposed, however, that as soon as practicable after the
war, the Governments of the two countries
should arrange an appropriate rate of interest
to apply from that time forward, and should
make appropriate provisions for retiring the
loan.
Since the beginning of the war, approximately $400,000,000 in Canadian money has
been made available to Britain through the
purchase by our Government of Canadian
Government securities held in Britain. In
other words, our Government during the war
has been paying off a part of the Dominion's
external debt. Under the arrangement now
proposed the Canadian Government will
purchase outright the remaining Dominion
Government and Canadian National Railway
securities owned by residents of Britain,
estimated in amount at some $295,000,000.
This means that the Canadian Government
will, before it becomes due, pay off its own
iremaining debt in Britain. The British
Government will pay the present owners of
The
these securities in pounds sterling.
Canadian Government, in turn, will pay the
British Government for the securities in
Canadian dollars.
For the future, in addition to the financial
provision for raising and maintaining Canada's
own armed forces, the Government will, as a
part of Canada's direct contribution to the
defeat of the Axis, ask Parliament to make
provision for meeting Britain's shortage of
Canadian dollars by supplying to Britain, free
of charge and without obligation, munitions of
war, raw materials, and food-stuffs up to an
amount of one billion dollars. Such provision
would mean that thereafter Canada's direct
war effort would include, in addition to ber
armed forces, an outright contribution of war
supplies on a vast scale.
The proposals I have outlined will, it is
anticipated, suffice to meet the requirements
of the United Kingdom for Canadian war
supplies until early in 1943.
In announcing this offer, I wish to draw
particular attention to the fact that the
financial burden of war now being borne by
the Canadian people will not be increased by
the proposed financial arrangements with the
United Kingdom. Canada already bas undertaken to supply the Canadian money required
by Britain to pay for Canadian war supplies.
Whether this money is provided in the form
of a loan to Britain or in the form of a direct.
contribution to the defeat of Hitler, will not
change the number of dollars which the Canadian people are already committed to raise for
the prosecution of the war.

Now I come to our defence war activities,
Army, Air Force, Navy, munitions and
supply.
As respects the Army: At the outbreak of
war the Permanent Active Militia, as Canada's
regular army was then called, included about
4,500 men. By the end of 1939, the Canadian
Active Service Force, to give the army its
name at that date, had increased to 64,000 men.
The first Canadian division had just arrived
in Britain.
At the close of 1940, the Active Army included almost 170,000 men. A Canadian corps
of two divisions had already been formed in
Britain. Canadian troops were also on active
service in Newfoundland, the British West
Indies and Iceland.
At the close of 1941, there were more than
260,000 men in the Canadian Active Army,
enlisted for service in any part of the world.
About half this number were on active service
outside Canada. A third infantry division, an
armoured division, an army tank brigade.
forestry troops, and other specialized units,
and thousands of reinforcements were in
Britain, in addition to the original corps of
two divisions.
Canadian troops continued to serve in Newfoundland and the West Indies. Two Canadian
regiments recently added a new chapter of
valour in the heroic defence of Hong Kong.
In addition to the Active Army, several
thousand young men had, during 1941, been
called up for military training and service in
Resources
the
National
under
Canada
Mobilization Act. Of this number, a considerable proportion had enlisted in the Active
Army, the Navy, and the Air Force. Some
thousands more had been assigned to duties
in Canada, thus relieving enlisted men for
service elsewhere.
Mention should also be made of the Reserve
Army, in which at the end of 1941, some 140,000
men were enrolled.
In order that my honourable friends may
bave an idea of conditions in 1941 as compared
with those in 1914, I desire to read a statement
by the Master General of the Ordnance, Mr.
Victor Sifton, made, I believe, in November
last. Here is what he says:
Rather than give you a mass of technical
detail I will contrast the last war with this
one. A Canadian infantry division in 1918
had 153 motor vehicles and 4,400 horses. The
cost plus upkeep at the front for one year was
$2,000,000.
A division to-day has no horses or wagons,
but it bas 3,500 motor vehicles of more than
160 different types, practically all of which are
being manufactured in Canada. Although there
are more than 160 types, only 7 models of
engines are used to drive them. The cost of
the vehieles used by a modern division plus
one year's upkeep is $12,000,000.

26

SENATE

Incidentally you will be interested to know
that the lst and 2nd Canadian divisions in
England are completely equipped. In fact there
are no better-equipped divisions in the British
army.
The fire power of a division in 1918 was
48 field guns; 96 machine guns; 40 trench
mortars and 432 Lewis guns. The cost for
one year, including upkeep and ammunition,
was $3,150,000.
To-day an infantry division has increased its
strength in field guns, doubled the number of
automatic small arms, has new and better
mortars and many types of weapons unknown
in 1918, suclh as anti-tank rifles and guns and
anti-aireraft guns. To-day's division has nany
times the fire power of a division in 1914-18.
The cost for one year of equipping and maintaining a modern division with these weapons,
including wastage and ammunition under battle
conditions. is $28,000,000. The comparison is
between $5,000,000 in 1918 and $28,000,000
in 1941.
Apart

from

rifles

and

pistols,

the

1941

weapons are of much higher quality and of
greater fire power than the weapons of the
last war.
I have given you coieparisons of transport
and fire power costs. But, apart from the
personnel, all eosts are higher. The overall
cost of a division in 1914-18 varied from
$30,000,000 to $48,000,000, according to the
severity of the fighting. To-day's cost of creating and maintaining an infantry division for
one year is $86,000,000.
It is interesting to compare the Canadian
Cavalry Brigade of the last war with the
Canadian Army Tank Brigade of the present
war. Both these formations have approximately the same strength in men. But the
striking power of the Tank Brigade is vastly
greater and, unfortunately, the cost bas
increased 9 to 1. The cost of the Cavalry
Brigade for 1 year, including ammunition, was
$3,500,000. The cost of the Tank Brigade for
1 year on a similar basis is $32,000,000. The
difference in lire power is so great that a
comparison is net possible.
Perhaps the most interesting formation in
the Canadian Army is the armoured division.
To equip and maintain it in action in the
field for 1 year will cost this country
$155,000,000.
An armoured division is, of
course, the most powerful and the costliest of
all land-fighting formations.
There was no
military formation in 1918 with which it can
be compared. But its cost can be compared
with the cost of maintaining the whole Canadian Corps in France in the full fiscal year
1916-17, which was $143,000,000, or $12,000,000
less than the cost of maintaining our armoured
division. And it will be remembered that
1916-17 was a year of heavy fighting, including
St. Eloi, Sanctuary Wood and the Somme.
The infantry division to-day can move long
distances and arrive at the point of action fresh
and strong.
In the last war a division of infantry in
coluinn of route occupied 15 miles of roadto-day a division in column of route occupies
from 60 to 140 miles of road, depending on its
tactical situation.
At 10 vehicles per mile, the Canadian Corps
at present in England would occupy on the
road a distance equal to the distance from
Toronto to Vancouver.
Right Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

Nor is the efliciency of modern war equipment easily impaired by weather or road
conditions. Bad weather bas often been the
decisive factor in campaigns. Thousands of
soldiers and great quantities of armament and
supplies were lost by Napoleon in the retreat
from Moscow because his horses were iot shod
and could not hold their feet on the ice. Our
military vehicles to-day are equipped with
specially designed non-skid tires which can run
for miles without air. Some of these trucks
have as many as 8 gear ratios which provide
traction under almost any conditions.
A comparison between the horse-power used
by the army and the electrical energy used in
this country is interesting. We are, as you
know, tremendous users of electrical energy.
One armoured division develops 394,237 horsepower, which is as much as the electrical power
used in the city of Toronto. In a word-the
12,000 soldiers in an armoured division have at
their disposal and under their control as much
inechanical power as used in terms of electrical
energy by all the citizens of Toronto.
In the last war, 12,000 soldiers had at their
disposal in army equipment 3,300 horse-power,
which is about equivalent to the electrical
power used in Gananoque or Lindsay.
One armoured division plus one infantry
division develops more power than all the
electrical energy used in the province of
Manitoba.
The Canadian Army is an army of machines,
and the eflicient use of machines depends upon
skilled men to operate and maintain them.
Industrial training is an essential preparation
for the modern army.
In the last war the best type of recruit was
a farn lad. He was strong and handy and
knew how to handle horses. He is still an
excellent recruit, the more so if he has had
experience repairing farm machinery and
operating the tracter.
To-day, 25 per cent of infantry must be
mechanics; 4.100 out of 17,000 men in a division
must be skilled in one or other of 53 trades.
A lack of skilled mechanics might easily
paralyse the army.
The scientific employment of machines rather
than flesh and blood is the goal at which we
are aiming.
The Royal Canadian Air Force, at the end
of the year, mustered well over 100,000 men,
excluding civilians. The Air Training Plan is
in full operation; the responsibilities and duties
for coastal defence, particularly on the Pacifie,
have greatly increased; and, the complete
establishment of 28 Canadian operational
squadrons overseas is to be fully achieved,not
only with a full complement of flying personnel, but also with all necessary ground and
maintenance crews.
Until such time as arrangements may have
been concluded with the Government of the
United Kingdom to increase the number of
Royal Canadian Air Force squadrons beyond
28, the Canadian pilots and other aircrew sent
overseas, in excess of the numbers needed to
maintain these Canadian squadrons at full

JANUARY 27, 1942

8trength, will serve with the Royal Air Force,
where thousands of their fellows are already
in active service.
Some increase in the home war establishment must be expected. Of this, for obvious
reasons, I cannot be expected to give details.
Thousands of young Canadians are now
engaged in active operations and the augmentation of trained men is accelerated.
The growing part of the R.C.A.F. in air
operations over Britain and the continent of
Europe has found sombre reflection in the
From the original three,
casualty lists.
Canada's own force in the field was expanded
to 28 squadrons, which have already been
formed or are in the final stages of formation.
Thousands more of the Canadian pilots and
aircrew trained under the Commonwealth
Plan are serving as individuals with the
Royal Air Force, not only in Britain, but also
in the Western Desert, the Far East, and
other theatres of war.
Over and above any commitments under
the Commonwealth Training Plan, the call
for highly qualified and scientifically trained
personnel for very special duties such as radio
location has been responded to by the dispatch
overseas of thousands who are fitted to fill
this immediate and important need.
Canada's share in the war in the air has
reached the stage where Canadian aircrew
have become a major factor in the striking
forces of the British Commonwealth.
On the outbreak of war, home defence duties
were its first responsibility, but in the closing
months of 1939 it was busily engaged in planning and arranging the organization details of
the gigantie British Commonwealth Air Training Plan.
The year 1940 was the year of construction
development for the plan. But in spite of the
strain which was then placed upon the force,
Canada's three fighting squadrons, which were
promptly sent overseas, did valiant service in
the Battle of Britain. In 1941, responsibilities
of the home war establishment for patrol work
in the Atlantic area and Newfoundland have
been ever-growing ones, and the outbreak of
war with Japan has added seriously to its tasks
on the Pacifie Coast.
The task of providing trained aircrew for
the active theatres of war through the Air
Training Plan continues to be the Royal
Canadian Air Force's heaviest burden in Canada. Its magnitude was still further enlarged
during the year, and the output of these
numbers by air training will continue to be
the heaviest work of the R.C.A.F. in Canada.
In the long run, as the Minister of National
Defence for Air has repeatedly warned us,
no more acute manpower problem faces the

27

Government than that of assuming the supply
of recruits for training as aircrew, not in the
immediate future, but some months or a year
hence. There is no question of reluctance to
serve; on the contrary, young men are eager
for the opportunity; but the numbers available
with the necessary high qualifications are
limited, because of our small population.
Looking ahead, we can see this question looms
far larger than the needs of the Navy or the
Army, or of industry.
To the solution of this problem by means of
the development of air cadtts, pre-entry
education, physical training and conditioning
and other means, the Government is directing
intensive study.
At six o'clock the Senate took recess.

The Senate resumed at eight o'clock.
Right Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Honourable members, I have given you the operations
of the Department of National Defence for
Air. I should like to submit now a few figures
from the Minister of National Defence for
Naval Services. In September, 1939, Canada
had 15 naval ships with a personnel of 1,774;
in January, 1940, 84 ships and 5,000 personnel;
in January, 1941, 181 ships and 14,800 personnel; in January, 1942, 352 ships and 27,600
personnel. In January, 1943, we shall have
424 ships and 38,000 personnel. It is estimated
that in March, 1943, we shall have 40,000 men
enlisted in the Navy.
Orders have been placed for about 150
merchant ships to be built and equipped in
Canada, by Canadian workmen, out of material
that is 95 per cent Canadian. In dead weight
capacity they will total 1,500,000 tons.
There will be 145 ten-thousand-ton ships
and 10 four-thousand seven-hundred-ton ships.
Seven of the larger ships have already been
launched.
Since the beginning of the war 8,000 ships
have sailed in convoy from Canadian ports,
carrying over fifty million tons of food and
war materials. These ships have carried the
flags of seventeen different nations.
This reminds me that in September, 1939,
when I stated we were undertaking to defend
our Atlantic coast and protect Newfoundland
and the French islands, my honourable friend,
who was thoroughly au fait with the naval
situation, put to me the question: "By what
means?" And I answered: "By all the means
at our disposai." That was very general and
did not cover any great responsibility. But
I suppose he will gladly commend the increase
of our Navy from 15 ships in 1939 to 352 this

Zb

SENATE

month as a formidable effort. However, I do
not ask him to make any daogerous avowal
in stating what I believe would be his state
of mind.
The statement which I now propose to
place before honourable members covers the
activities of the Department of Munitions and
Supply under Mr. IHowe:
Since Parliament last met, the conversion
of Canadian industry to total war production
has proceeded apace. War contracts awarded
by the Depa'rtment of Munitions and Supply
and contract commitments to the end of 1941
on Canadian, United Kingdom and Allied
accounts now total 3,200 million dollars. Of
this amount, 550 millions have been provided
in the form of capital assistance to industry
for the expansion and construction of plant,
and for the installation of machine tools and
other equipment. Every item of the production programme, which includes guns, ammunition, naval and cargo vessels, planes,
tanks, meehanical transport, and personal
equipment, is now in production.
Shipbuilding: The first of the 10-thousandton cargo vessels lias been delivered and 87
are scheduled for 1942 delivery. Sixty-nine
corvettes were delivered in 1941, and 31 minesweepers. Deliveries of smaller craft totalled
50. Construction has begun on 2 Tribal Class
destroyers.
Aircraft: The aircraft industry of Canada
is producing aircraft required to operate the
British Commonwealth Air Training Plan, as
weIl as long-range bombers, fighters and flying
boats. The total production of planes at the
end of the year, for the period beginning
September, 1939, was 5,212. The present production is at a rate of approximately 300 airframes per month.
Mechanical Transport:
A total of 200
thousand units of various types of army transport has been produced and shipped to the
various wa r fronts. The monthly production
of this type of equipment is now in the
thousands.
Arnoured Figlting Vehicles:
Canada is
producing 2 typces of tank, an infantry tank
and a cruiser tank. Production will reach a
rate of over 200 per month early this year.
The current monthly rate of production of
Universal Carriers is 700.
Guns and Equipments:
Canada is now
producing 10 types of naval, field, and antiaircraft guns and equipments. Rates of production for 1942 for these various types are
as follows: anti-aireraft 400 per nonth; antiaircraft loose barrels 1,000 per month; field
guns 550 per month; naval guns 150 per
month.
Right Hon. _Mr. DANDURAND.

Machine Guns and Small Arms:
The
machine gun and small arm programme is
already producing at high capacity. Schedule
production for early 1942 is: Bren guns 4,000
per month; Browning aircraft machine guns
3,000 per month; Browning machine guns for
tanks 2,000 per month; Boys anti-tank rifle
5,000 per month; Vickers naval machine gun
100 per month; Sten machine carbine 2,500
per month; standard infantry rifle 25,000 per
month.
This programme also includes trench mortars, bomb throwers, and smoke projectors.
Ammunition and Ammunition Components:
Canada is now producing thousands
of rounds of filled ammunition of all types,
including all prime materials and components: brass, chemicals and explosives, cartridge cases, fuses, primers, gaines, and tubes.
Bombs: Present production ranges from 500poundi bombs to practice sizes, including
mortar bombs, grenades, anti-tank mines, and
depth charges, and is already at a rate of
thousands per month.
Pyrotechnies: This group includes signal
cartridges, flamefloats, flares, smoke generators,
etc. Monthly production is now in excess of
100,000 for all types.
Instruments: Canada is producing for her
own account and for United Kingdom and
Allied accounts all types of precision instruments required for the operation of modern
war equipinent. Production is now at the rate
of hundreds per month and is being stepped-up
rapidly.
Explosives and Chemicals: Some 25 plants
have been established for the production of
explosives and chemicals, with a monthly rate
approaching 70 million pounds.
Personal Equipment and Commissary: Industries normally engaged in peace-tine production
arc now producing thousands of articles of
per-onal equipment, barracks stores, foodstufï, furniture and like inaterials.
Construction: Value of buildings and other
construction projects undertaken for the armed
s'ervices amounted to approximately 180 million
dollars, representing 1,900 contracts.
Bits and Pieces Programme: This organization has been set up to encourage subcontracting and the full use of idle plant
capacity.
Government-owned
Companies: Thirteen
Crown corporations are operating as agents
for the Department of Munitions and Supply,
some purchasing and others producing.
Wartime Industries Control Board: Serions
shortages of essential raw and prime materials
have required drastie curtailment of the use
of sucb materials for civilian purposes. The
orders of the Wartime Industries Control

JANUARY 27, 1942
Board are designed to protect these materials
for war needs. The major restrictions relate to:
(a) elimination of passenger automobile production; (b) restriction of the use of rubber,
silk, tin, etc.; (c) restriction of the use of steel;
(d) rationing of gasoline and oil; (e) restriction and elimination of the output of household
appliances.
The operations of the Department of Munitions and Supply are so vast that I should not
be surprised if this statement were incomplete,
but at any rate the information will no doubt
be of value to honourable members.
I come now to the Government programme
for the present year, which bas been prepared
in reference to the fiscal year ending March
31, 1943.
As I have already stated, the Navy now
has 350 ships and more than 27,000 men in
the service. The programme of expansion for
1942 can be expressed very simply. Our shipbuilding capacity is 'being used to build ships
for Britain and for Canada. Apart from the
naval craft built for Britain, the Navy will
take all the ships Canada can build, and it will
enlist and train the men required to man the
ships. No limitation has been placed upon
the number either of ships or men, save in
so far as the number of available ships necessarily sets a limit to the number of men who
can be enlisted for training.
The Canadian Active Army now consists of
the corps of three infantry divisions, divisional
and corps troops, an armoured division, and
an army tank brigade in Britain. In addition,
there are in Britain in reinforcement units
thousands of reinforcements. A fourth infantry
division and the brigade groups of a sixth
division have been mobilized in Canada. In
addition, there are the troops on home defence
duties on our coasts and in vulnerable areas,
and troops in training as reinforcements.
During 1942 it is proposed to create overseas
a Canadian army of two army corps; one army
corps to comprise three infantry divisions and
two army tank brigades; the other to consist
of two armoured divisions. In addition, al]
necessary ancillary units to serve these two
corps will be provided. To reach this objective
it will be necessary: first, to convert the
present 4th division into an armoured division,
and, to train and equip it for this special role
and despatch it overseas in due course; second,
to raise, equip, train and despatch overseas
another army tank brigade for use with the
infantry divisions of the Canadian corps;
third, to raise, equip, train and despatch
additional ancillary troops both for the
infantry corps and the new armoured corps;
fourth, ta maintain and reinforce these two

29

corps; fifth, to provide headquarters staff
organizations for an army and an armoured
corps.
It will, however, be recognized that the
ultimate disposition of all troops necessarily
depends upon circumstances which determine
the course of the war.
As for the territorial defence of Canada,
special dispositions have been made where
that seemed to be required, as a result of the
outbreak of war with Japan. The garrisons
of coast defences have been strengthened.
Reserves have been allotted to deal with any
likely emergency.
A special reorganization and regrouping of
reserve formations is under way right across
Canada, and an emergency organization of
active service personnel in training centres or
elsewhere is being established.
Whether it will be necessary to mobilize
another division for Canadian defence when
the 4th armoured, division is despatched overseas will, of course, depend on developments
in the intervening period.
The situation in Canada in respect to antiaircraft defence is improving each month as
more equipment becomes available. New units
are being mobilized in accordance with anticipated deliveries of equipment.
The 1942 army programme will create a
thoroughly modern, well balanced and hardhitting Canadian overseas army. This army
will be complete and self-contained. It will
be capable of operating in any theatre, and
can be effectively maintained both in respect
to man-power and equipment.
It should be noted that the outstanding
feature of the army programme for 1942 is
the proposed increase in the armoured
strength of the army overseas. This development is in line withanilitary experience in the
present war and with the policy of the British
Army.
The effectiveness of Canada's own armed
forces depends upon the effort put forth on the
farms, in the mines, in the forests, in the
workshops and factories, on the railways and
the merchant ships of Canada.
Canadian
production since the war began has been
essential to the effort of Britain and, indeed,
of every nation fighting the Axis powers. The
dependence on Canadian productive efforts
of what are now called the United Nations
will be greater than ever in 1942.
I have already pointed out that the Government has set no limits to war production.
The only limits are those imposed by the
growing scarcity of management, tools, raw
materials, and skilled labour. Although the
Minister of Munitions and Supply told Parliament in November that practically all avail-

30

SENATE

able establishments in Canada were already
engaged in war production, he recently stated
that he was "raising the sights again". More
production can be achieved only by the conversion of existing establishments from nonessential production, and by the transfer of
labour. There is no slack left in our industrial
economy, but I shall be surprised indeed
if we do not find, when the year ends, that
Canadian industry and Canadian labour have
once again amazed us all.
The productive increases already achieved
by Canadian agriculture have been little
short of miraculous. Cheese production bas
increased by one-fifth, concentrated milk output by two-thirds, hog production bas doubled,
and egg production will soon be at an all-time
high. For this third year of the war dairy
farmers, hog producers and poultry men have
been asked to produce the maximum quantities
Canada bas contracts with Great

products amounting to 618,000,000 pounds.
The forthcoming agreement for cheese is
expected to be for at least 125,000,000 pounds.
Six hundred and seventy-five thousand cases
of evaporated milk will probably, again this
year, be required by Britain. The present

fruit and vegetable products in substantial
quantities. Altogether, the value of the exports
of those commodities will be at least $180,000,Exports of the same products in the

year before the war were valued at about
$50,000,000.
If we do all in our power to help tbem meet
their labour problems, we can, I know, count
on Canadian farmers to do the rest. But the
goal which is set for them for 1942 will
demand their utmost effort.
This gives an idea of the plans and programme of the Government. I believe that
the statements which come from the Department of Munitions and Supply, from the
Navy, the Air Force and the Army should
give to Canadians cause for pride in the
efforts that have been carried on since September, 1939. The Government of Canada
has been commended for its activity and its
efforts during the last two years and a half,
and I have no doubt that, altbough mozt of
my colleagues facing me are silent, there is a
conviction in tIis Chamber that Canada bas
not failed. but bas reason to be proud of what
I-ghit Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

it bas done. I feel quite confident that before
this debate is closed we shall hear words of
commendation of the efforts of the Government since the beginning of the war.
Hon. Mrs. FALLIS:
ment of the debate.

I move the adjourn-

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I was in hopes
that we might make some further progress in
this debate, but I am ready to abide by the
request of the honourable senator.
Hon. Mrs. FALLIS: If anyone else is
ready to go on to-niglt, I am content that
lie should do so.
Hon. GUSTAVE LACASSE: Honourable
members, I am always pleased to have the
opportunity of rescuing a lady in distress, and
am quite content that the honourable scenator should have a chance to prepare ber speech.
I wish I had been given the sane chance and
that the House had adjourned until to-morrow,
for, in this particular case, I approve of the
action of the honourable leader opposite
(Hon. Mr. Ballantyne), who fully prepared
his speech and recad it from the manuscript.
I sincerelv absolve him from any blaie for
thjus challenging the rules of the House,
becatuse, under present circumstances, nobody
can be too well prepared to utter any pronouncements in this House or in any other.
May I be
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE:
allowed te say that the Prime Minister in
another place last nighît read froin maniscript
for two hours.
Hon. Mr. LACASSE: I am sorry my bonourable friend misinterprets what I say. I
was complimenting him.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: I thoiight the
honourable gentleman said it was contrary to
the rules of the louse.
Hon. Mr. LACASSE: I was just expressing
my approval of what the honourable gentleman had done on this particular occasion.
My first duty is to compliment the mover
(Hon. Mr. MacLennan) and the seconder
(Hon. Mr. Gouin) of the Address in reply to
the Speech from the Throne. I was keenly
interested in the speech delivered and the
figures cited by the honourable senator from
Margarce Forks (Hon. Mr. MacLennan)figures which were later repeated by the leader
of the House, and which were most impressive
in so far as the war record of the Government
is concerned. I was greatly interested also in
listening to the remarks of my good friend
from De Salaberry (Hon. Mr. Gouin), whose
eloquence reminded us of three generations of
distinguished gentlemen who have given their
best to the country. I also wish to compliment

JANUARY 27, 1942
the honourable gentleman in another respect.
I know what a strain it is mentally, and even
physically, to have to address an audience in
two languages, and to shift from one to the
other. We are all apt to take the easiest way
and simply repeat what we have just said, only
in a different language. Well, I compliment
my honourable friend particularly upon the
fact that he did not do this. He said something
new in English, which was just as interesting
as what he had stated in French, and this made
his address much more original, picturesque
and interesting.
I wish to offer my compliments again to the
acting leader on the other side of the House
(Hon. Mr. Ballantyne), and I hope he understands me rightly this time. I think it was
only right that, as a desk-mate of the former
leader opposite, who is no longer among us
(Right Hon. Mr. Meighen), he should succeed
him in that office. I hope his position will
become something more than an acting one,
and that we shall soon have the opportunity
of greeting him as the permanent leader of
the Opposition.
Right Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: But in this
House there is no leader of the Opposition.
There is a leader of Conservative thought,
if there is such a thing as Conservative thought.
Hon. Mr. LACASSE: There is one little
reservation, however, whiclh I will add to my
compliments. In spite of the fact that my
honourable friend stated in his preliminary
remarks that he would sincerely try not to
make a partisan address, he used, in the very
second or third sentence of his speech, the
terrible phrase, "scuttling of Parliament." That
expression does not agree very well with the
other. However, he is such a good companion
and fine gentleman that I am willing to absolve
him in this case too.
The main points I want to deal with are the
two things my honourable friend emphasized
as being the desfres of the Conservative party
-whatever that might mean at the present
time, as my right honourable leader suggested
a moment ago. The honourable gentleman said
that the Conservative party desired the setting up of a National Government, or, to be
more precise, I will say a so-called National
Government, and the immediate adoption of
conscription for overseas service. Honourable
members will note that I am calling the thing
by its right name. As a doctor, I must put
the right label on the right bottle.
Now, in so far as National Government and
conscription are concerned, I do not think
it would be right, intelligent or logical to conclude that because two hundred individuals
representing disgruntled mine operators or

vindictive newspaper publishers in Toronto
organize a "Petite Convention Nationale"
which expresses a desire for these two things,
we should disregard the opinion of an overwhelming majority of the six or seven million
electors of Canada as expressed less than two
years ago in opposition to these two proposals.
Everybody remembers what happened at the
last election. I will go so far as to say that
the proposal for a National Government itself
was rejected by the electors at that time.
The then leader of the Conservative partyor was it called the National Government
party then?-was so well aware of the trend
of public opinion in those days that, although
a veteran of the last war, he declared himself
emphatically against conscription. These are
historical facts.
Hon. Mr. DUFF: He got his reward. He
has a good job.
Hon. Mr. LACASSE: I do not want to
emphasize that unnecessarily. It seems to me
that when we start to speak about these
things, we should do as the draftsman of a
bill does: define our terms first. It should be
made clear what is meant by "National Government." That has not been done since 1940.
Mr. Winston Churchill, Prime Minister of
Great Britain, has been quoted repeatedly
since the beginning of this debate. We all
listened to him when he was here, for we
realized he was the most illustrious guest
Canada had had since the visit of Their
Majesties to our shores. His utterances were
very interesting, and they moved me deeply,
as they did everyone, but I have in mind
particularly one sentence, which he did not
pronounce in his speech, but which was uttered
in an interview given by him a little while
after he spoke in the House of Commons. He
said, "If we let the present condemn the
past, God bless the future." I have seldom
run across sd few words meaning so much.
These were indeed very wise words, and they
carried a deep meaning. They could be
translated into these more colloquial terms:
there is no use crying over the upset applecart.
This does not mean that the lessons of history should be ignored, that recent facts should
not be rightly interpreted, or that the deductions properly to be drawn from them should
not be mentioned at any time.
This war has been a very grim and very
powerful teacher. It has taught us a lot
already. Let us mention a few things we
have learned from it. The successes of the
Axis powers are explained mainly by two
facts: first, by the fact that they made
thorough preparations while their prospective

32

foes, our Allies of to-day, were sitting around
idle. But J am not going to cry over spilt
milk. I will leave that point alone just now,
in accordance with the advice of Mr.
Churchill, which I respect. But I have the
right to mention the fact that Germany was
working while we were sitting idle and paying
our people to remain idle. That is a very
crude fact which we must face now in order
to understand the causes of the trouble and
what remedies to apply. The second fact
which explains the Axis successes is that
from the beginning of the war the Axis powers
have been on the offensive. Thus they have
had the tremendous advantage of knowing
where the next attack was going to be
launched, whereas all the countries on the
defensive could only wait anxiously, while
trying to guess where the enemy might strike
next.
The war bas also made us aware of some
facts, which we did not suspect before now,
wiith regard to certain sister countries. These
facts particularly have some connection with
the situation existing in Canada to-day. Take
for instance the case of Australia.
That
country
is the second most important
Dominion in the British Empire. It is much
more homogeneously English than Canada is.
According to statements which I heard in the
last election campaign. Australia vas much
better prepared than we were. And more
recently 1 heard that Australia had been far
more generous than Canada in the matter of
sending troops abroad. She sent ber gallant
aviators and soldiers to Grecce, to Crcte, to
North Africa, to Malaya, and so on. So far
did Australia go along that line-this is the
point J want to emphasize to-night-that when
she found herself facing a crisis, through
exposure to the eneny, ber Prime Minister,
Mr. John Curtin, turned his eye in despair,
not towards London, but towards Washington.
Secondly, the Australian Covernment sent out
a call to aviators who Lad been sent away to
come back and defend tIeir own country. So
Australia was depleted of ber own defenders
for the sake of others. Well, that is a masterpiece in generosity. but net in home security.
That ought to teach us a lesson which should
not go unnoticed, particularly when our
country is exposed more than ever on the
Pacifie coast to the new threat from the Japs.
I want to pay my compliments to one man
in particular, and my doing so may indicate
to my good friend the honourable leader
opposite (Hon. Mr. Ballantyne) that I am
even less partisan than he himself is. That
man is none other than the Associate Editor
of the Ottawa Journal, Mr. Grattan O'Leary,
who I think is not a very strong Liberal. I
want to pay my compliments to him for
Hon. Mlr. LACASSE.

what Le said about Ireland, his mother
country, and, in a certain measure, mine also.
Even if I have to surprise some of my
French Canadian friends here, I will say that.
Mr. O'Leary went to Ireland, and after he
came back to this country Le was courageous
enough to open the eyes of his fellow citizens
in Canada to facts which they had constantly
ignored. To-night I am going to add to what
Le has already told us some statistical statements about
good old and
oft-decried
Southern Ireland, which may surprise many
members of this House. Southern Ireland,
with a population of three million, has at this
very moment 120,000 voluntary recruits fighting
under the British flag, while Ulster, with a
population of one and a quarter million, has
only 1,900 voluntary recruits under that flag.
I leave that to your consideration, and ask
you to revise your opinion about Ireland.
Those are facts we should bear in mind. But
I should add that instead of 1,900, which was
the figure quoted by the Belfast News, I
really believe it should be 19,000. Even so,
we have as against that figure 120,000 voluntary recruits from Catholic Nationalist Ireland
fighting under the British flag, which is ours
also.
Hon. Mr. BLACK: I do not want to interrupt the honourable gentleman, but perhaps
le loses sight of tbe fact that there are more
than 50,000 Northern Irishmen forming an
integral part of the British Army; and of
course Northern Ireland is part 'of Great
Britain. I mention this as the figures quoted
by the onourable gentleman might leave an
entirely erroneous impression on the minds of
the public
I welcome that

additional
information-and
may
I be
permitted to mention also the fact that there
is no conscription in Ulster. I shall be quite
willing to make any adjustments that may be
necessary, for there is no desire on my part
to befog the issues or convey erroneous
impressions in these critical times. The point
I wish to make is this, that certain wholesome
conclusions should Le dirawn from the figures
and from the circumstances to which they
relate.

Now, just a word about South Africa. I
have never yet heard that that Dominion
has decided to resort to compulsory military
service. So far there Las been found enough
goodwill and heroism and appreciation of
duty to enable the Government to organize
an army strong enough to take a major part
in bringing about the destruction of Mussolini's African empire. I like the way Churchill
pronounces the name, and I share his contempt for Hitler's lackey.

as I arn about to state it, I arn not certain,
but we ail know the position of the Prime
Minister of Canada, particularly in recent
years. To be perfectly candid, I fully believe
that liad we not liad a man of the prudence
of thle present Prime Minister in skil1fullY
choosing a middle course policy, we should
have seen civil *war. I am absolutely frank
about it. Tliat is a danger which is still
existing and challenging the men wlio have

33

the responsibility of adrninistering aur national
affairs at the present time. A middle course
policy is the policy for a country like Canada,
whicli is ail Britishi politically, but not al
Englisli racially. Let us bear that in mind.
I dlaim te be as good a Britislier as any
Englishman, but nobody will ever make an
Englishman out of me. Neither will anyone
make a Frenclirnan out of an Englishman.
As my good friend from De Salaberry (Hon.
Mr. Gouin) se aptly said this afternoon, our
patriotic duty at tlie present time is te try
te think in ternis of Canada-rny fatlierland
and yeurs. I would submait that for the
consideration of lionourable members.
Let me refer te the Gallup poîîs. A Gallup
poîl was planned by certain gentlemen of the
Press to build up a streng case against the
Administration in cennection witli the adoption
of cornpulsory military service. What was my
surprise wlien one morning I discovered that
in spite of the fact that the Gallup poîî had
been orgamized by a machinery which. was in
streng opposition to the present Government,
the final figures showed 66 per cent in favour
of Mr. King. That is wliy another organiza..
tien had te be started up riglit away to wipe
eut that blet on the escutcheon of the rich
mine proprietors of Nertliern Ontario and the
ricli newspaper publishers of Toronto. Will my
fellow-countrymen lie willing te submit themselves te sucli a so-called "Committee for Total
War," te bring about a s0 called National
,Gevernment?
Wliat lias liappened in our awn city of
Windsor shortly after wliat took place in
Toronto? By the way, Mr. Nickle dared ta
break the unanimity of tlie Toronto meeting,
as referred te by rny leader this afternoon,
and my geod friend Miss Agnes MacPhail
was alse a dissentient. New, wliat liappened
in Windsor? A few days after tlie Toronto
meeting a gentleman-I arn geing te give hie
name, because I do net think lie is exactly
publicity shy-a gentleman by the naine of Mr.
Wallace R. Campbell, president of the Ford
Metor Cempany of Canada, called a meeting
at a place which we humble Canadians keep
gomng with our dollars-the local Red Cross
headquarters. That was a very appropriate
place, of course, for hie could enjoy the joke
of liaving good Liberals help pay for hie headquarters that niglit anyway. A group of 135
persons attended the meeting. Needless ta
say, I wais net one of the chosen few; I did net
have a purity-dress te lie worthy of attending
a "wedding" of sucli splendeur. The sitting
member for Essex East and an ex-member of
Parliament-I do net care te name him, except
te say lie was a member of the Administration
in the days when the Riglit Hon. Arthur

SENATE

Meighen was Prime Minister, and therefore
not a Liberal-refused to attend, for everybody
knew under what auspices that meeting was
organized; the saine auspices under which the
Toronto meeting had been brought about. There
was one dissenting voice among those 135 persons. Most of those present did not dare vote
against Mr. Campbell, because of their business connections. I am fully aware of these
facts and give them to you as a true reflection
of what actually took place in Windsor. I
know the impression that some persons who
occupy influential positions in clerical, professional and business circles in Windsor had
of that meeting, because they said afterwards
they wished they had not gone. I am sure
their enthusiasm for a National Government
was not the same as that of our local master
mind. It is in such "select" meetings that
the idea of National Government is being
re-concocted-a stream-lined National Government organized by men in the stream-lined
business. I hope that, like the "Zephyr," it
will be gone with the wind before long.
What is Mr. King doing to-day? Realizing
te the full the situation in Canada, be does
one thing: Le makes a most generous concession-much more generous, in fact, than I
would have made were I Prime Minister of
Canada. He turns not to the newspaper publisher on King street west, Toronto, but to his
only competent judges, the people of Canada, and he asks his fellow citizens not to
vote for or against conscription, but to relcase
him from his pledges as regards conscription.
He asks them to relieve him from the solemn
promise made by himself and his supporters
throughout the land in so far as military
service overseas is concerned. The people of
Canada are going to be called upon to pronounce upon one issue alone, not upon the
achievements or misdeeds of the Covernment
and not in respect of the personalities of
the candidates representing this, that or the
other view. Turning honestly towards the
people, the Prime Minister asks thein to
relieve him of a promise which bas become
more or less cumbersome at the present time.
I think that is the honest way to go about it,
and I repeat that I do net think I would
have gone so far myself. The last man vho
should accuse the Prime Minister of being
a coward for doing that is the man who
advocated the same policy in Hamilton in
1925.
Some Hon. SENATORS:

No, no.

Hon. Mr. LACASSE: Honourable gentlemen know to whom I refer.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: Who is he?
Hon. Mr. LACASSE.

Hon. Mr. LACASSE: I was just trying to
show my respect for the former leader of the
other side in this House by not naming him,
but since the honourable gentleman insists, I
am going to name him. He is the Right Hon.
Arthur Meighen. What I say seems to be
cerroborated by the silence of my honourable
friend.
Some Hon. SENATORS: No, no.
An Hon. SENATOR: What did Le promise?
Hon. Mr. LACASSE: I have not exactly
what Le said before me, and I do not think
honourable gentlemen have either; so I will
take a chance on it. If my memory serves me
aright, he declared emphatically that should
he ever believe conscription had become
necessary he would not belong to a Government that would adopt it without referring
the issue to the country.

Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: No, no.
Hon. Mr. LACASSE: I stand to be
corrected, but that was the interpretation of
the public.
An Hon. SENATOR: That is your interpretation, not that of the public.
Hon. Mr. LACASSE: We are searching for
the truth.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: My honourable
friend is somewhat in error in the statement
lie las attributed to the late leader of the
other side. I have the text before me, but I
think my memory will suffice. He did not
speak of conscription, but Le said that if he
were leader of the Government le would not
allow any soldier or expedition to cross the
Atlantic witlout dissolving Parliament and
appealing to the people.
An Hon. SENATOR: That is right.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: If I may be
allowed, le said a little more than that. He
said that if war broke out and he were Prime
Minister and head of the Government at the
time, lie would make every immediate active
preparation for war, but Le would appeal to
the country to endorse vhat bad been donc.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: May I ask the honourable
gentlemxan a question. What I am worried
about is this. If we have a plebiscite and a
majority of the people of Canada as a whole
vote to release the Government, is that a
release, or does it have to be by provinces or
by constituencies?
Hon. Mr. LACASSE: That is entering into
details, and I do not think I can give you
the details. I can give only my interpretation.
I think the vote is going to be a vote at large,
irrespective of provincial boundary lines or

JANUARY 27, 1942
constituencies. It is going to be a general
Canadian plebiscite, and the mai ority will
carry the day. I thjnk that is the way the
honourable gentleman understands it.

35

I stand. I think the Government should make
an effort to place the matter before the public
in the most impartial way in order that the
people may decide intelligently. There should

have ail done our share of criticizing the
Government for its slowness in getting started.
But perhaps Canada had no monopoly in that
regard, for it s'eemed te be a failing of al
the democratic countries. Now that we have
got into our stride we bave accomplished a
great deal in many directions.
The honourable senator f-rn. De Salaberry
(Hon. Mr. Gouin), with ail the natural charm
and gif t for oratory that seem to be the fortunate possession of so many from bis province, gave us an address to which it was a
delight to listen.
The honourable senator from Essex (Hon.
Mr. Lacaqse), who preceded me in this debate,
gave us a very interesting addrcss last niglit,
in which he covered a great deal of territory.
I do not intend in my remarks to take in as
rnucb territory as be did. I arn going to
devote my time to two topies on wbicb bie
spoke last nigbt.
The first subjeet to wbich hie paid considerable attention was tbe formation of an
Ontario committee for the prosecution of total
war. The bonourable member apparently bas
no very great love for that particular commnittee. lie expressed two objections to the
way in which the work of this committee was
being conducted.
In the first place, bie criticized the committee
for having made use of raid spae~ in some of
the leading newspapers of tbe province of
Ontario for the purpose of presenting its
views to tbe people. I sbould like to say to
bonourable members that even if the Government in power, wbicb the honourable member
supports, bas a very large rnajority, it bas
nlot yet assumed control of the newspapers of
tbis country. We stili bave a free Press, and
wben we cease to have a free Press we shall
be in the samne category as tbe countries under
the domination of Hitler, wbere only the party
in power bas a right to use tbe newspapers.
In the second place the honourable senator
made a statement calling attention ta the
cost of this paid space in the Press. He said,
"Evidently there is a great deal of money
yet in circulation which has flot been used
Hie
for huying war savings certificates."
repeated this assertion two or three times,
evidently considering it of some importance.
Well, ever since this war bas been well under
way, the Government in power bas sent otI do not tbink I arn exaggerating in saying

in connection witb tbe war, and information

Some Hon. SENATORS:

Hear, hear.

lion. Mrs. FALLIS: A second item, one
wbicb is very important and whicb engages
tbe attention of ail at tbe present moment,
is the decision of the Government to take a
plebiscite. I sbould like to say biere tbat
neyer since the present Government was
returned. to power in Marcb of 1940 bave I,
frorn my place in this Huse or from tbe
public platform, uttered one single word of
criticisrn until the present moment. I took
that course, not because I saw eye to eye
witb the Government in every respect, but
because I felt that the work wbich I was doing
-war work witb women in women 's organizations, in contatct ail the tirne with wornen of
aIl political beliefs--would be more effective
if I refrained frorn anything whicb could be
construed as playing polities. But to-day, if

I arn ta be true to my own convictions, and
to the thousands of warnen who are bewildered
and confused-yes, disrnayed-at the events
of the past two days, then I toa must utter
my pratest, futile tbough it may be, in conjunction witb others wbo have opposed the

taking of this plebiscite.
Frankly, I say to bionourable members taday, I bad boped, I bad even confidentiy
expected, that some mnembers in the Prime
Minister's own following would reacb heigbts
that some Conservatives reacbed in the British
House of Commons after the Narway fiasco,
when tbey placed the needs of their country
at the moment above party loyalty. There
was fia talk there of a piebiscite, there was
no talk of a generai election. Ail that was
said was, "Tbere is only one tbing tbat
matters, and that is the winning of this war,"
and tbey irnmediately took the steps wbich
tbey thought were necessary ta attain that
objective. I bad expected tbat a substantial
number of Liberal members of eitber House
would use tbeir utmost influence ta see that
tbe British plan was adopted in this cauntry,
namely, the plan of governmental responsibility and the supremacy of Parliament.
Apparently I bad expected taa much; sa we
are gaing ta bave a plebiscite.
We are ail familiar naw with the reason
for balding this plebiscite. It can he stated
in one sentence. The Prime Minister han

JANUARY 28, 1942
announced that he will ask ta be releasad
from a pledge that he gave in the last election,
a pledýga that hae would not at nny time introduce conscription for overseas service.
The logical deduction, as I see it, is that the
Prime Ministar bas now become convinced
that conscription is necassary. Otherwise thare
would be no point in bis asking to be releasad
from bis promise. I believa, along with vary
many others in this country, that the proper
course of procadure would have baan to
settia this matter on tha floor of Parliament.
The Prime Minister of this country bas access
ta information which is not possessed by you
and me, and is perhaps aven lass available ta
the average man on the straat. Becausa of
that, ha is in a position ta give leadership.
If Parliament had been called ta secret
session and the members mada acquainted
with tha secret information which the Prima
Minister possessed, thay too miglit have sean
the necessity of conscription, luat as ha
apparcntly is seeing it, and so we should
hava had the matter decidad in the British
way, by governmental responsibility and tha
supremacy of Parliament, instaad of a question
being- submitted ta the people in the form of
a plebiscita, as proposad. Even as it is, I
think we could have excused this particular
expense ta 'which the country is baing put,
if we had had anything definita from the
Prime Minister as ta what is ta follow the
taking of this plebiscite. But up ta the
moment wa are ail in the dark, completaly.
The only argument submitted by the followers of Mr. King, aither in this House or in
another place, bas been that it was not
possible ta do as I have suggestad, because
the Prime Minister could flot break a preelection pledge. Well, 1 cannot refrain from
asking why ail at once it becomes sa axcaadingly important for a Prima Minister ta keep
a pre-alection pledge. I have been a student
of Canadian history more or less ail my 111e,
I have watched govarnments in oparation for
xnany years, and, like avery honourable
member of this House, I hava known praelection pledges ta be givan and ta ba
broken. And thay were not ail given by
Consarvative leaders or broken by them. The
leader of the prasent Govarnment bas been in
the sama catagory with other leaders in this
respect. Then, if pre-election pledges could
ba broken before without even a ripple of
dissent from the foilowers of the leader, why
bas it suddenly bacoma very imperativa that
this pledge shouîd be kept? Oh, I know
what my Liberal friands would say. They
would say that this one is of more importance
than preceding pladges which had bean broken.
WeIl, perhaps sa, and perhaps nat. It al

37

depends on the personal viewpoint. I can
see that this pledge is intensely important
to many people in this country; they feel it
is important; but there are thousands of others
who consider it just another pre-election
pledge and are flot even interested in it.
The honourable senator from Margaree
Forks (Hon. Mr. MacLennan) expressed the
Liberal point of view yesterday: he said we
must have a plebiscite because this pledge
couid not ba brokan. By way of illustration
he remarked that if he signad a promissory
note he must fulfil his obligation, no matter
what conditions prevail at the time. I arn
sure the honourable senator would ha the last
one to say that, if a note were made out for
$500 it would be honoured. but if it were for
only $50 it would be a minor note and therefore need not be honourad. I consider that
a promise is a promise, and that this pledge
is no more important than others that have
bean given in the past at elaction tima and
thrown into the scrap basket immediataly
aftarwards, for no reasons at ail excapt those
of political expediency. Now, please do not
misunderstand me. I am not for a moment
suggesting that 1 condone the breakîng of
pledges in the past, or at any time; but, having
regard to the fact that what I have just stated
is true, that pre-election pladges bave been
given and broken over and over again, I find
it impossible ta become unduly excited over
the thought that this ona might have found
its way inta the scrap basket along with many
othars from the past.
As a matter of fact, it saams that this pladge
might have bean broken with even less compunction than is ordinarily fit, because it is
only of minor importance when considered in
the Iight of the axigencias of the moment. To
my way of thinking, these are of immansaly
greatar importance than the keeping of a selfimposcd pledga, for which Canad-a did not ask
and in which a great many people are not
even interasted. Personally, I should have
preferred ta see the present Government take
the attitude that was taken by the British
Government, or by President Roosevelt. The
British Government, first under Mr. Baldwin
and then under Mr. Chamberlain, was committed to, a policy of no compulsory service,
yet, aven befora war was declared, that policy
was changed without a plabiscite, witbout a
genaral alaction, without a reference to the
people; and thare was no word of protest,
because the people realized that conditions had
nrisen of immeasurabiy greatar importance
than the Govcrnment's pre-election pledge.
And what about President Roosevelt? In his

to the rights of Parliament, but also an undeserved reflection upon the people of this
country, to whatever race or creed they belong.
The Government, notwithstanding its command of Parliament in the two Houses, has
decided to submit to the people the question
whether, if in the Government's opinion it
becomes necessary to have compulsory military
service for overseas, it may ask Parliament to
legislate accordingly. In the light of the
principles of parliamentary and responsible
government, and in the light of national interest, the proposition seems to me quite indefensible and preposterous. But the Government and its defenders say that there is a
reason, namely, that in the past the Government and the party it represents have made
commitments not to make Canadian military
service compulsory for overseas or on United
States soil. As the honourable senator who
has just preceded me (Hon. Mrs. Fallis) has
asked: "Has the Government or the Liberal
party, through its Ministers, not made many
promises, and promises in connection with the
war, which it has not kept? And has it been
criticized severely, or criticized at all, for not
having kept them?" In 1930 the Liberal party
lost power. In 1935 it came back from exile,
and it made promises then, as it made promises
at by-elections later. Let me read you some
of the commitments. Of course we must remember the background. In 1935 the Ethiopian
crisis brought forward the question whether
the imposition of sanctions would lead to war
with Italy. Mr. King, eajoling for votes,
decided he had to give some assurance against
war, and he gave it in this way at a public
meeting in Quebec.
Right Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: What is
the date?
Hon. Mr. COTE: September 28, 1935; that
was the day preceding the voting at Quebec.
Mr. King said:
I say that Mr. Bennett has no right to commit Canada in any way, directly or indirectly,
or to take any action whatever as regards the
possibility of war. The people of Canada are
opposed to war and a war in such a distant
part of the world holds no interest for Canada.
Mr. Bennett has no right to commit the country
before consulting the people by means of a
plebiscite.
This solemn declaration of principle as
guidance for the Prime Ministers of Canada,
I should say, applied to Mr. King just as
much as to Mr. Bennett. And, the commitment
is clear: Mr. King was not going to do it,
although that bad man Bennett might.
Early in 1938 a by-election was held in St.
Henry, Montreal. Colleagues of Mr. King,
responsible Ministers of the Crown, spoke at

39

that by-election, voicing a policy which the
electors had to assume was the policy of the
Government. At a public meeting in January
Hon. Mr. Cardin said:
I have already so stated ten times: Canada
will not participate in wars beyond its territory. Canada will do nothing in wars beyond
Canadian territory. What do you want more?
What do you want better? I am for the
defence of my country 100 per cent-150 per
cent if that were possible, but when other
nations are at war I am nought per cent.
I could add many more quotations, but I
refrain because if I did I might arouse a
feeling of contempt for and revulsion against
men who now hold positions of great confidence, and I have quoted enough to support
my point.
I submit it is elear that the pledge of Mr.
King was not to engage Canada in a foreign
war without a plebisciýte; and in the case of
Mr. Cardin, not te have Canada take part
in a war in Europe by sending soldiers overseas, either volunteers or conscripts. These
pledges were broken in September, 1939, when
Parliament declared war on Germany. Was
the Liberal party seriously assailed or taken
to task as a result? Not at all. Certainly
at that time I heard, no reference in Parliament to broken promises or false pledges. On
the contrary, when Canada declared war on
Germany there arose from the nation a sigh
of relief because we had not been betrayed.
But we are told :that the commitment which
the Government now wishes to be relieved of,
not by Parliament, but by the voters, is something entirely different and more serious, and
therefore more binding. It is this: When
Canada, through its Parliament, served notice
on Germany that it was going to use its might
and power to co-oiperate with the forces of
Christianity and civilization to crush Hitler's
evil and sinister designs, the Prime Minister
said there would be no conscription of manpower in Canada. No doubt this assurance
brought cheer to the enemy, and to those in
our land who will not admit that the Liberai
party may have been wrong in the sad experience of 1917, referred to yesterday by
the honourable senator from De Salaberry
(Hon. Mr. Gouin). But was this pledge more
binding than the ones I have just mentioned as having been broken? Is it more
dignified in character than the pledge that
no soldiers would be sent abroad to take part
in any war? Is it more sacred because it
may have given comfort to the enemy, and
he may have been deceived by it? Surely
not.
Then what is the difference? Is there any?
In the one case the pledge was, "We will not
send soldiers overseas"; in the other, the

40

one we are dealing with, it was, "Having
sent soldiers overseas, we will nlot support
them beyond volunfary enlisfments, even if
that system faius." Yes, there is a difference!

SENATE

I want, like those who have preceded me in
this debate, to pay tributa to the mover and
the seconder of the Address, for the very interesting and eloquent maniner in whieh they
presented their views te this House. Every
session we have speeches by the honourable
sanators who move and second the Address,
but seldom have we had the pleasure of
listening to such interesting prasantations as
at this session.
I aise want to refer to the speech of the
right bhonourable leader of the Govarnment in
this House (Right lion. Mr. Dandurand).
M'henever hie speaks we find it interesting to
listen. What lie did on this occasion was to
give us a recitai of the accomplishiments of
Canada in its war effort. It is well for the
people of Canada te be advised from time to
time as te what the Gevernment is doing, but
I arn inclined te think that we are getting
antirely tee much prepaganda on the Government's war effort. The honourabla senater
,te my left (lien. Mrs. Fa]lis) said that tons
of literature were distributed threugbout the
country te advartise what we are doing in the
war. The quantity of such literature that is
being sent eut, and, upon racaip.t, tbrown into
the ivaste paper basket, sboýuld be measured,
net in tons, but in hundreds of tons. That
dees net mean that ail tbis stuif is worthless.
On the contrary, sorne of it centains a great
deal of valuabie information, but the quantity
is so large that no oe could ever get time te
read it ail; se the natural result is that very
little of it is read.
I arn glad te join in commendatien of the
labourers in our factorias who are proch.cing
that vast volume of implements of war te
whicb tha honourable leader of this lieuse has
referred, and I want tei congratulate ail the
people wbo have bougbt and, are buying war
saving certifica tes and war bonds ie order
te make possible the financing of this production. And here, it seems te me, it is well
te remind supporters of the Government of
a very important faet, namaly, that it is the
people of Canada whe are making this great
war effort. I arn ready te admit that since
the country really get into its stride in produeing war material it bas done marvellously.
My critîsism is that the Government did not
move quickly eneugh in the first instance.
Indeed, the Government did net move at aIl
until public opinion, aroused by the sariousness of the crisis, forced it te move.
The Speech from the Threne contains a
paragraýpb wbich is in fact the kernel of the
whole speech, the paragrapb dealing with the
proposed plebiseite. I do net know whetlier
I would oppose sucb a course if there were
real ground for it; but while this country is
Hon. Mr. BLACK.

in tha midst of a terrifie war we surely do
net nced te waste time, te say nothing of
money, in ordar to get the opinion of the
people as te whether or net wa should prosecute this war te the utmost of our ability.
Let us ask ourseives whetber the propnnad
plebiseita will hatp or detar our war effort.
The only answ-ar I bave heard at aIl, if indeed
it can bc called an answvcr, was made by
Premier Godbout on Mond'ay last. I do net
know whether hie gave the rigbt answer or
net, but I arm assuming he is in the confidence of the powers that bie. Thase are bis
words as they appear in the Ottawa Journal,
the
Ottawa
Citizen, and the
Montreal
Gazette:
Mr. King has aiways been against conscription
for overseas service, and je view of what
happened je Australia, ha will net impose
conscription.
'lia will net impose conscription." Whether
or net that is a correct interpretation of what
the result will be after 'tbe plehiscite is taken,
1 do net know.
Undoubtedly Mr. King
desires te be released from bis pledge against
imposing conscription for ovarseas service,
,but ýhe does net say hie will whole-heartadly
prosecute the war if the proposed plebiscite
gives him a free hand.
In that connection I desire te eall attentien te the remarks of twe -or 'three other
honoura)ble senators with raference te the
effect which the Australian situation mýay
bave on Canada. 1 would remind honourable
senators tbat when war broke eut it was much
nearer the shores of Canada than of Australia, and this condition obtained until
Japan's recent attack on Pearl Harber. In
1940, Australia sent four full divisions te
South Africa, and other troops te Greece and
the Far East. Those seldiars 'have already
made a glorieus war record. True, Australia
sent ber treeps everseas on the advice and
perhaps at the request of the British Government, but at the time we did net know that
Japan would become engaged against tha
Ailied Nations. New Austrailia's trueps are
required te proteet their homeiand, and thay
are being returned there as fast as transports
becoma available, and, se far as I can gather,
nearly ail Australia's flying men are back
home te repel Japanese air-raids. Let me
add, however, that Australia neyer resorted
te a plebiscite before entering the war. The
Australians did exactly as wa sbould have
done from tbe beginning. They were prapared and ready te send their men wherever
they might ha required.
As reference bas been made te Australia's
war effort, I desire te aive soe comparative
figures as te Australian and Canadian enlistments on a population basis. It shouid ha

JANUARY 28, 1942
borne in mind that Australia has a population
of about 7,000,000. I am told our population
is about 11,500,000, but I will take it as being
about 11,000,000. Up to October, 1941, Australia raised an expeditionary force of
170,000 men; had under arms, ready to go anywhere in Australia, 200,000 men; and a home
guard of 50,000 men for home protection. The
home guard is made up largely of veterans of
the last war. The Royal Australian Air Force
numbers 60,000 trained men, and 200,000 men
have volunteered for air service. In the
Australian Navy there are 20,000 men. These
represent a total of 500,000 men as of October,
1941, and I am advised that at the end of
December, 1941, that total had been increased
to 655,000 men.
Now I come to the figures for Canada. We
have an expeditionary force of about 250,000
men; for home defence about 250,000 men; in
the Air Force 100,000 men, and in the Navy
27,000 men. These are the round figures as at
December 31 last. The total is 620,000 men
under arms. But if we relate these figures to
population, Canada's total should be 1,100,000
men.
When i.t is also remembered that Australia
bas produced per head of population just as
much in arms, tanks, guns and planes as we
have, I do not think it is right for us to
boast of our war effort. In fact Australia,
taking into account its smaller population, bas
donc very much better t'han we have. While
I am proud of our war effort and am quite
sure that we are ready to do a great deal
more, yet, after all, we have not reached anything like the peak of production that we
should have re-ached had we begun our effort
at the proper time and place.
I do not know how honourable members
opposite felt when they heard that the Government would seek from the people by means
of a plebiscite release from certain commitments, but my reaction was about the same as
the reaction of the average Canadian. It
shocked the country that the Government
should even deem it necessary to take time
out for the proposed plebiscite when this
country was engaged in the most terrible
struggle the world bas ever known. We have
all heard the somewhat trite saying that Nero
fiddied while Rome burned. Well, 1 think
that if the Government proceeds with the proposed plebiscite history will record that King
quibbled while the freedom and very existence
of Canada and the British Empire trembled on
the brink. I go farther. While the Beauharnois scandal was under investigation the
Prime Minister said that his party was passing
through the valley of humiliation. If at this
time of crisis the people of Canada are to be
distracted for two or three or four months from
44567-44

43

an all-out war effort while the Government is
proceeding with its proposed plebiscite, then,
I submit, the Government will lead this
country through the very depths of the valley
of humiliation.
As I understand that several honourable
senators desire to present their views on the
proposed plebiscite, I shall refrain from discussing many things that I should like to
bring to the attention of the House, and
shall content myself with this appeal to the
Government: that Canada be not put to the
humiliation of a plebiscite election-for a
plebiscite is virtually an election-during wartime. If the Prime Minister feels he bas given
such a solemn pledge as he could not in
honour break, and if at the same time he finds
it is absolutely necessary that that pledge be
broken in order that Canada may be free to
put forth her utmost effort in this war, then
he bas one other course open to him. He bas
a strong following in the House of Commons,
many of whom, I am sure, do not share his
view on the point in question. Let 1im resign
as Premier and hand the leadership over to
one of the able men who sit either on bis
right or his lef t.
I have a very deep personal interest in the
prosecution of this war, for I have four near
relatives, including a son and a nephew in the
army overseas. and five other near relatives
in the navy. It is perfectly natural, I think,
that I should be desirous that they should
have some proper assurance that they and their
fellows will not be left unsupported in Europe
or elsewhere, but will have the help of reinforcements from this country. I have no doubt
at all that sooner or later the Canadian
divisions already in England will be crossing
over to the Continent. They will not be
kept in England to guard that country for
ever. It is my opinion that in order to win
the war we must invade Europe; and I am
sure that the mothers, wives, sisters and
sweethearts of the men in the army would
like to know positively that this Government
or some other Government will see to it that
their men-folk are amply supplied with reinforcements.
We should not delay. Let us get on with
the war. Let us get man-power by conscription or any other means, so that there
may be no uncertainty about bringing the
war to a satisfactory conclusion and it may
be said that Canada bas done her part with
the other democracies of the world.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: With the permission

That Johin F. 3MaeNeill, K.C., be appoiuted
La o Clu

Scuntc, i the place and stcad of the late
W. F'. (iCoiiior. K.C. anuid cuit lio ho iaid a
salary of $6.000 per aniîunîi as from February 1,
1942.

He said: Honourabla senators, so far as I
remnember, v'e bave hiad two Law Clerks. I
do net know -%vlether Mr. Creigbton w'as the
first, He w as xvitb us for a quarter of a century ou' more. Tben Mr. O'Connor, after a('ting
provisionally for a few sessions, t'as regeîlarly
appointed to the position at a salary of S6,000,
whîich represented tbe maximum he could
obtain. lia apparently enjoyed rohust baaltb,
but I regret to say lie left us suddenly some
fourteen iuontlis ago, and since bis deatb we
bave Lean witbout a Law Clark.
We sliall need, as a successor te Mi'.
O'Connor', a gentleman possessing ail the
neeessary qualifications and with suficient
autbority to express bis views te tbe various
standhing comnittees wlîicb will fî'om time
to time cousult hirn on buis coming hefora
them. It has taken us somae time to find a
successor who w'ould be quite satisfactoî'y te
the Sonate in gcnem'al, but I lelieve that; in
Mr. MacN_1eill wve have found a gentleman
who wvill fully measure up to our requirane n t
Mr'. John FerLes MaNilis a B.A., LL.B.
and K.C. He tvas boî'n in Hampton, _New
Brunswick, on September 25, 1897. Ha was

JANUARY 29, 1942
educated in the public schools of New Brunswick and Nova Scotia. In 1921 he received
his B.A. frome Acadia University, and in 1923
received his LL.B. from Dalhousie University
and was admitted to the Bar of Nova Scotia.
He served in the Canadian Expeditionary
Force from October 20, 1915, until discharged
on general demobilization on March 30, 1919.
He saw service at the front in the Royal
Canadian Regiment and the 3rd Battalion of
the Canadian Machine Gun Corps. His rank
on discharge was that of lieutenant.
He was appointed King's Counsel by the
Government of the Province of Nova Scotia
on June 17, 1938. He served as secretary to
Sir Charles Fitzpatrick, Chairman of the
Statute Revision Commission, from 1924 to
1927, and has been in the Department of
Justice since 1927, for most of the time as
senior counsel. He was a member of the
Canadian delegation to the Conference on
Codification of International Law, held at The
Hague in 1930.
I may say that if we retain his services
as from February 1, he will have an opportunity to familiarize himself with the duties
pertaining to the office; and besides he will be
at the disposal of the Department of Justice,
in order that he may finish some important
work with which be has been entrusted.
My colleague, Mr. Ilsley, Minister of
Finance, was afraid he might lose Mr. MacNeill's services in connection with the work in
which lie is at present engaged., in relation to
the agreements between the Dominon and the
provinces in the field of income and corporation taxes. The Minister of Finance asked
that Mr. MacNeill be permitted by the
Senate to complete those labours. I was in
touch with Mr. MacNeill this morning to
ascertain whether it was understood that, while
not neglecting his duties as Law Clerk of the
Senate, lie would continue to carry on the
work he was doing in the department, and he
informed me that lie had assured the Minister
of Finance that he would remain by his side
until that work was concluded.
Mr. MacNeill bas also been serving on the
Censorship Committee, with which, if required,
lie will continue to work. This service is outside of his duties in the Department of
Justice.
I may say that quite often Mr. MacNeill
appeared before our committees as the representive of the Department of Justice, and on
those occasions I formed the highest opinion
of his clear judgment and his knowledge in
regard to the matters that were before us.
Although Mr. MacNeill will continue to
serve the Department of Justice for a time
after his appointment as of the lst of Feb-

45

ruary, it goes without saying that lie can claim
only one salary.
When I mentioned to the late Minister of
Justice, Mr. Lapointe, the wish of the Senate
to have Mr. MacNeill, he did not altogether
approve of the idea of Mr. MacNeill's severance from the personnel of the Department of
Justice. Later, when I explained the reasons
for Mr. MacNeill's desire to transfer his
activities to the Senate, Mr. Lapointe said,
"If that is his desire, I will not stand in his
way." Furthermore, when Mr. St. Laurent
took over the office of Minister of Justice be
wanted to be assured, before letting Mr. MacNeill go, that be could dispense with his
services. After discussing the matter with the
Deputy Minister, he agreed to allow Mr.
MacNeill to withdraw from the Department
of Justice if it was his desire to do so, and to
come to the Senate.
In these circumstances I think that we
should be quite happy to have Mr. MacNeill
as our Law Clerk and adviser in the various
activities of the Senate.
Hon. C. C. BALLANTYNE: Honourable
senators, I am sure we are all agreed on the
necessity of having a good and well-versed
legal gentleman to look after the requirements of the Senate of Canada. I do not
know Mr. MacNeill, but after hearing the
record of his education, his training at the Bar,
and the number of years lie bas spent with the
Department of Justice, I want to congratulate
the Government on securing the services of
such an able man to act as our legal adviser.
I judge from the remarks of the right honourable the leader that it will be some time
before Mr. MacNeill will be required to take
on many duties in connection with the Senate,
and that he bas considerable work yet to do
in the Department of Justice. That being so,
I presume that the Department of Justice will
be responsible for his salary until such time
as there is sufficient work to keep him engaged
here.
Right Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: It will
not matter very much if lie is paid as a
Senate official from the first of February,
since his salary chargeable against the Department of Justice will have ceased.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: I second the
motion.
The motion was agreed to.

Hon. GEORGE PARENT, Speaker of the
Sonate, read the followicg address:
Le très honorable Raoul Dandurand, C.P., C.R.,
LL.D., de la cité de Montréal, dans la
province de Québec.
Cher Sénateur,
En témoignage de notre estime et de notre
admiration, nours vous offrons le buste que
notre artiste Alfred Laliberté a fait de vous
on y mettant le meilletur de son talent et
surtout le souci de capter et de bien rendre
le caractère de son modèle.
L'artiste a si bien rétussi que noirs sommes
heureux de vous faire cette présentation aussi
bien qtue d'offrir un exemplaire de ce buste au
Sénat, où il perpétuera le souvenir de vos
bien belles qualités et de la brillante carrière
qui on est le résultat.
Nous espérons que nos successeurs en cette
Chambre y trouveront un motif d'inspiration
et d'encouragement.

The Right Honourable Raoul Dandurand,
P.C., K.C., LL.D., of tbe City of Montreal,
in the Province of Quebec.
Dear Senator,
As a token, bowever inadequate, of our
esteem and admiration, we offer you this bust
of yourself in which the sculptor, Alfred
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE.

Laliberté, bias made the best use of his talents
and has faithfully portrayed the character of
bis model.
The success of the artist has encouraged us
to make this prosentation to you, and to offer
a copy cf the bust to, the Senate, wbere it
will serve te perpetuate the memory of your
many great qualities and of your distinguished
career.
WVe confidently believe that cur successors
in this Chamber will find in it a source of
inspiration and encouragement.
Hon. ME-MBERS: Hcar, bear.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: Honourable
moembers cf the Sonate and cf the floeuse cf
Commons. I think it will meet with the
approval of alI if I now ask the Right Honcurable the Prime Minister to supplement the
foxw xxords I have just read.
Righit Hon. W. L. M'ýACKENZIE EING
(Prime Minister) : Mr. Speaker, honourable
inembers of tie Sonate, cîleagues of the
House cf Commons, and others presont, and
my dear fricnd Senator- Dacdurand: May 1
fii-st cf ail express to the innimboîs cf the
Sonate iny own vcry deep appreciation, and I
think I mnny iclde the dceep appreciation of
miY colleagues from tlîe fouse of Commnons,
of the cotrrtesy and prix ilege xx ich yen have
"CeiO'dcd tus tbis afiernoon in inviting, us te
attend rit the presentation te otîr friend
Senator Dandurand of tbis very fitting
memorial cf a groat, man and a great career.
In these tines, xvhen wo are so bnsily
engaged in political discuîssion, and when the
xxorld is in a stateocf turinoil, it is net merely
a pleasure, but a solaco, te ho able te, cerne
together ira commion pur-pose te loin in expressmg te cne who bais been an example te us
all somietbing cf the appreciatien xvhich his
life and career bave mneant, net only te us
wlhc are bis friends, but te tîxe country, and,
indeed, in seme meastîro te the xvorld itself.
Senate- iDandurand lias been a great pachiamentarian-T shcrnld srxy, nt that bc bias been,
btît that hoe is a great parliamentarian. It
seoms almost suporfluous to say anytbing bore
cf his caceor, foc in some particulars it is
botter known, I think, to many persons in tbis

Chamber than it is even to mnysoîf. But it is
interosting to recaîl that we have witb us one
who at the ageoef eig-hty is young in mind,
in spirit and in endeavour, and it is a great
pleasure te be able te say, in bis presence,
sometbing of xvhat we feel concerning 'him.
Young as ho is in mind, in spirit and in
endeavour, it is a cemarkable fact that Senator
Dandurand shotîld be a link between Sir
WVilfrid Laurier's years in office and the
present day. Ho is, I tbink, the only romain-

JANUARY 29, 1942
ing member of this House, the Senate, who
was appointed in Sir Wilfrid Laurier's tirne.
His rnembership here spans many years. To
all of us it is a source of higb satisfaction tbat
,he bas been spared as a living link with those
years of the past, to ýmake bis presence s0
vitally feit as it is at this time.
Among the Privy Councillors of Canada bie
is, as you know, fifth in the line of seniority,
preceded o'nly by Sir William Mulock, Sir
Charles Fitzpatrick, and our dear frienda,
Sir Allen Ayleswortb and George Grahiam:
Tbroughout the years since bis appointment
to tbe Senate lie bas rendered continuous service in the halls of Parliament.
And lie is not only a great parliamentarian,
but a great Canadian. Senator Dandurand
bas always placed above every other consideration the position wbich lie believed
Canada should bold and will hold among the
nations of tbe world. The part that lie bas
played in belping to bring Canada into its
present position of equal status witb ail the
otber nations of the Britishi Commonwealth
of Nations, is well known. 0f all great causes
he bas been a doughty champion.
1 will flot say more of bim as a great citizen
of Canada, as we know of bis many activities
in our own country.- 1 should like Vo :mention,'
liowever, something that must be in tbe minds
of ail, namely, the important place lie bas
occupied in tbe international arena, bis prominence in world affaira. Few if any citizens in
the history of Canada bave played in Europe
quite the samne important role that Senator
Dandurand lias played. I sbould think that,
by and large, lie was better known Vo public
men in Europe than any otber Canadian-I
mean better known in a personal way, enjoying intimate friendships with an many. The
record of bis devoted labours at the League
of Nations is, of course, part of tbe history
of international affairs, and it is a pleasure to
be able to tell him to-day tliat that work
brouglit not only distinction Vo himself, but
great bonour to our country and a deep sense
of pride to all wbo know him.
One is tempted Vo add mucli more, but 1
shall conclude simply by repeating what I said
at the outset, namely that Senator Dandurand
is not only a great parliamentarian, a great
citizen of Canada and a great internationalist,
but bie is a great example Vo aIl: a pattern for
the young men wbo are looking forward to a
life of service Vo their country; Vo tbose in
middle age, a splendid proof of whait ean be
acbieved in the course of years by endurance
and character, and to aIl of advancing years,
a reminder that thougli the years roll on, youth
rnay remain Vo the end.

I cannot say, Senator Dandurand, how
grateful I amn for aIl that you have meant
and been to mie in my public 11f e. Perbaps
but one or two others have been as close to
me. We bave been acquainted, indeed we
have heen friends, for 'over forty years; for
twenty of those years we bave together sbared
responsibilities in the Cabinet, and for nearly
fifteen of those years, le'adership of the Government in our respective buses of Parliament. I could not possi-bly bave begun Vo
meet some of the probiems that bad to býe
fa-ced by one in my position during that long
period of ime witbout the wise counsel,
guidance, friendsbip and, I migbt say, the
many expressions of affection wbicb you
have so generously accorded me. I arn sure,
Senator, that each and every one of us will
regard tbis day as one cf our proudest
memories, and tbat i our bearts we shall
ever cherisb the warmnest regard for your
great qualities of mind and heart, and the
best of wisbes for your continued bealtb,
happiness and public service over many
years Vo corne.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: I tbink, bonourable senators, it would be well te bear fromn
the ocher side of the House, and I can think
of no one better fitted Vo address us than the
bonourable gentleman wbo bias, for many
years 'been associated with the Rigbt Hon.
Senator Dandurand. I arn pieased therefore
f0 ask Hon. Senator Ballantyne to say a
few words.
Hon. C. C. BALLANTYNE: Mr. Speaker,
Mr. Prime Minister and members of the
Cabinet, and lionourable senators and gentlemen, I consider it a great honour and privilege to be present to-day and to associate
myscîf with those wbo are kathered bere Vo
do bonour to my old friend the Right Hon.
Raoul Dandurand. Like the Prime Minister,
I bave bhad tbe privilege of knowing the riglit
bonourable gentleman for over forty yeara.
We both corne froro the city of Mentreal,
*and I arn certain you ahl know tbat lie is one
of our most outstanding citizens, bighly
respected by ail, a gentleman of great breadtli
cf view and always active in wbhatever would
benefit bis city. Si'milarly, lie lias furthered
the intereats cf his native province and, as
the Prime Minister lias so well pointed out,
heelbas been an infiuentiaJ figure in Dominion
affaira. 1 feel it an honour to ait in this
Cbamber with the Government leader, wliose
'birtbday we are now celebratîng.
I bave already congratulated you, Senator
Dandurand, on your eigbtietli anniversary.
Long may you be spared Vo se many more

48

SENATE

birthdays, and may we be associated together
in this Chamber for a good many years to
come.
I am delighted to know that this fine work
of art is to remain here. This bust will be a
reminder to us and to those who will succeed
us of a highly cultured and kindly gentleman, a great Canadian and a world figure.
I may be allowed to congratulate the Prime
Minister on having in his Privy Council an
adviser of such long experience and great
ability to assist him and his colleagues in
guiding the Shiýp of State through these
troublesome years of war.
I wish I were gifted with the eloquence of
my old friend the Prime Minister in order
that I might deal adequately with this historie
occasion, but I must content myself, sir, by
again wishing yen long life, happiness and
prosperity.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: It is quite likely
that another voice from the House of Conmons would be welcome, and I think Mr.
Blackmore is well able to respond to my call.
Mr. J. H. BLACKMORE, M.P.: Mr.
Speaker, Senator Dandurand, Mr. Prime Minister, members of the Senate, members of the
Cabinet, and distinguished guests, I am completely taken aback at this sudden imposition
of honour. I have not known Senator Dandurand very long. I knew him by reputation long
before I knew him personally, and I feel fully
justified in concurring in all the kind sentiments so eloquently expressed in respect of
the right honourable senator.
When I was teaching school-during what I
believe were the finest years of my lifeI often strove to impress on my students the
importance of those fine lines from Browning:
Grow old along with ime!
The best is yet to be,
The last of life, for which the first was made.
And I used to point out te the senior students
the fine inspiration which lies in those beautiful
lices of Tennyson's Ulysses:
Tho' much is taken, much abides; and tho'
We are not now that strength which in
old days

Moved artih and heaven:
Tiat whici we are, we are;
One equal temeper of heroic hear
Made wxeak by tine and fate,

But strong in vill
To strive, to seek, to find, ant not to yield.
Could I, Senator Dandurand, have had
you seated before my classes, I feel that I
could in all sincerity and propriety have
pointed to you as a shining example of the
truth in those inspiring and comforting verses.
I appreciate deeply the honour conferred
upon me in thus being asked to say a few words
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE.

on this red-letter day when we have the satisfaction of seeing a long and useful and, I
believe, a good life receive some measure of
honour ere its close.
Right Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND rose
to reply, and was greeted with prolonged
applause.
He said: Mr. Speaker, my friends of the
Senate, my friends of the Privy Council and
my friends of the House of Commons, may I
say that as I was being led to this seat I had
the feeling that I was celebrating my one
hundredth
birthday, because during my
experience in the Senate it was my duty on
two occasions to conduct to this chair
colleagues of mine-Mr. Wark, from New
Brunswick, and Mr. Dessaulles, from Quebec
-both
of whon had reached their one
hundredth year. This really made me wonder
if I had reached the century mark. I think,
Mr. Speaker, that yen might perhaps have
awaited the completion of the cycle and have
allowed mie to come to this chair twenty
years hence rather than now. At all events, I
reserve the right to moint it again in twenty
years, and I know that on that occasion, as
mnost of you are my juniors, you will all be
around me again.
It is needless for me to tell you, Mr.
Speaker, Mr. Prime Minister, Mr. Ballantyne
and Mr. Blacknore, that I have been deeply
moved by the very many marks of friendliness that have conte to mie fromî my colleagues
of the Senate and of the Privy Council. I
have been wondering what was the explanation
of the kindly attentions bestowed upon me.
In pondering on the question of what could
be their justification, I was reminded of a
reply made by my dear old friend Sir Wilfrid
Laurier on an occasion when he was asked
if during his lifetime he bad met more devoted
people or rnore egotists. He answered that
during his long experiecelie iad found that
people bad the instinct of sociability, and
therefore of kindlincss, and ie felt that, generally speaking, people were good and kind. It
is in the fact that I have been surrounded
by tmen of that nature iere, in the Privy
Council, and throughout iy life, that I find
the explanation of their forgetting my shorteomings and gathering around me to-day te
telil me. as they have done before. of their
friendship for me. I thank them from the
bottom of my heart for this sentiment which
flows to me, and which I prize more than
anything else. Life without sympathy and
without friends is hardly worth while. Of
both you bave given me full measure, flowing
over. (Applause).
I should perhaps say to you, Mr. Prime
Minister, that when you speak to me of my

49

JANUARY 29, 1942
stay in Geneva and of the raie 'which I played
there, I recail that it was you, my dear
coIleague, who decided that I should be, the
representative of the Canadian Government
in the Assembly of the League of Nations.
I thank you for the honours that have corne
to me through my presence at Geneva, and
for retaining in me such confidence that
thrice, since 1921, I was sworn into Cabinets
of the Dominion of Canada of which yau
were the head. (Applauso).

Hon. JOHN T. HAIG: Honourable senators,
I hope flot ta take too much of your time
at this stage of the proceedîings. First, 1
should like ta congratulate the mover (Hon.
Mr. MacLennan) and the seconder (Hon. Mr.
Gouin) of the Address. In the part of the
country framn which I came, it was always
considered a very great honour ta ho asked
ta mave or second the Address, and the
persans so honoured were usually markod as
possibly successful aspirants for future promotion. I also wish ta affor my congratulations ta the ather speakers wha have proceded me, ail of whami it is nat necessary for
me ta namne. Naturally, we were delighted
with the speech made hy the acting leader
of this side of the House (Hon. Mr.
Ballantyne) and, as always, with that of the
right hanaurable leader of the Gavornrnent
(.Right Han. Mr. Dandurand).
0f course, we on this side of the House
naturally feel the loss of aur former leader
Whether or
(Right Honi. Mr. Meigheu).
not hoe is called ta higher service in another
place, we shall always remember with ploasure,
nat only on this side but also, I arn sure,

on the other side of the House, the lustre
which hie added ta the groat traditions of the
Senate when hoe sat either ta the rigýht or
ta the ef t of the Speaker.
Right Hon.
hear.

Mr. DANDURAND:

Hear,

Hon. Mr. HAIG: I should also like ta
congratulate the honourable lady fram Peterborough (Hon. Mrs. Foulis) on the excellent
address which she delivered yesterday afternoon.

I resorve special mention for the hion-

ourable member from East Ottawa (Hon.
Mr. Coté). I bave always beun praud ta
ho a Canadian citizen, but I was daubly
proud of that hanour as I listened last nigbt,
when, on behaîf of ane af aur two groat
races, hoe paid s0 eloquent a tribute of loyolty
ta Canada.
The war, naturally, is uppermast in aur
rninds.

It shuts out ail athor prablems.

We

try samotimes ta forget the war, but it is
always with us. Canada is making a notable
contribution in regard ta munitions and supplies, including tanks, guns, aeroplanes, and
sa on. thanks ta the energ-etic work of the
Ministor of Munitions and Supply and ta
the loyal co-operation af factary ownors and
Canada's production effort was
workmen.
somewhat slow in starting, and I arn inclined
to apportion some af the blame for that ta
the Gavernment, though honaurable mernbers opposite may think 1 arn unfair in doing
sa. But this rnuch is beyond dispute: the
oporatars and workmen in aur industries are
making a contribution ta the war effort that
will compare favourably with the wor production af any ai the United Nations.
An Hon. SENATOR:

Hear, boa r.

Han. Mr. HAIG: I think thase oporatars
and warkmen. will bring ta that effort an
enthusiosrn as whale-heorted as that which
animated aur soldiers in the hast war an the
fields af France and Flanders-soldiers whase
sans have valiantly upheld the gloriaus traditions af the Canadian Army in Narwoy and
in1 Hong Kong.

Another

important

contribution

ta

the

I say
war effort is aur farm production.
quite candidly that sioce the outbreak of war
the Government hias nat, in my opinion,
givon as rnuch thought and energy ta assisting aur farmers as it lias devoted ta ather
war prohlems. This is ail the more regrettable bocause large surpluses af food piled up
in this country will hcoaf great importance
when the war is over, and will, no daubt,
assist us in making the right kind af poace.
Peace moy be a long way off, but we ail feel
the outlook is botter now than it was n year
ao, because to-day we have the mighty arrny
of Russia fighting against the German hardes,
and in addition we have as active partners
against the Axis powers aur good friends and
neighbours, almast aur brathers, across the
lino, with their tremendous industrial organization led by anc af the great leaders of
ail tirno.
Some Hon. SENATORS:

Hoar, hear.

Hon. Mr. HAIG: As rnoy be supposod, I
am very mauch interested in the grain former,

but I want the Governrnent to put as much
cnergy into helping our farma production, no
matter wvbat particular branch, as it is
putting into industrial production, since, as
I have said, our reserv es of food will undoubtedly be an important factor when we
corne to settie world peace.
Let me deal now with another war problem.
I refer te man-power. It is no secret that
right alonig there have been sufflicient volunteers for the Naval Service, and the Minister
of National Defence for Naval Affairs has
told the country that as fast as the Government can build new ships there will be men
ready to man tbern. And I arn glad to know
that our young meni have volueteered in
large numbers for the Air Force. 1 rnay
say 1 have eard that in certain sections of
c
the Dominion young fellows have been
rejected beeause they l.,cked the scholastic
training insisted on by the dcpartment. Such
a higb educational standard may be cssential,
and ie this regard, cf course, I bow te the
judgment of those in ,iitliority, but it seerns
to me it rnight bc well to lowver the educational standard to seine extent in order to
afford equal opportunity te young mon al
over Canada who wisli te loin the Air
Serv ice. My own boy is in the Air Service,
ami I bavec the greatest respect for its personnel. for 1 realize the many bazards that
our airmen hav e te face. Indeed, te use
a somewhat grirn word. if there is a "suicide"
greup in our fightung forces it is surely te be
found ie the Air Force.
I was disappointed wlicn I saw the drcss
furnisbed te our soldiers. You rnay say that
is a littie thing, but beys are boys, and wben
yen have beys cf yeur owe you cani speak
with ail the more authority on their likes
and dislikcs.
Rigbt Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: They have
two dres.ses now.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I know that. But two
years bave gene by. The beys in the dark
hlîîp uniforrn of tbe Navy, with their swaggermng wide pants, and the beys ini the lighit blue
uniforma cf the Air Force, yeu notice as tbey

Hen. Mr. CALDER: Se do the girls.
Hen. Mr. HAIG: Well, the Arrny boys do
net like it. I arn glad the Goernment has
realized the situation and taken action. A
friend cf mine wbo came back from the last
war with the rank of major said te me at
the opening of the present war: "Yeu sbould

more than repaid by the desire wbich the more

attractive dress will arouse in young men te
joie the Army." The mere attractiveness of
the uniforma is net important in itself, but it
is somcthicg te be considered when you are
clealing with young men from cighteen te
twenty years of âge.
As bas been well said, this war wiIl be wen
by the man behind the gun.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: And on the land.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Yes, and on the land. It
is. in the final analysis, the only place wbcre
it can be won. After we have won tbe war
we shaîl have te fecd the starving peoples cf
Europe. Wbcc you read tbe heroc exploits

But to-(lay comnmand of the air is ail-important.
In faet, cacb service is complemcntary te, the

and cf our tanks and etber mechanical cquipment, but fundamcntally we have te rcly on

We Canadians this morning were disturbed
whcn we read cf the loss of the Lady Hawkins.
It brings berne te us with tragie cmpbasis tbat

Tbe issue now facing Canada is whethcr the
Governrncnt should be relcased frore a certain
pledige made some time ago. I do net tbink
that a discussion along political lices would
adv ance our war effort one bit. On the contrary, 1 believe bonourable senators would ho
sevcrciy criticized if they provokcd sucb a
dliscuission.
But I do subrnit tbat if the
proposcd plebiscite is taken, it will bave te be
fcr sornetbinig more than tbe purpose cf releasing the Prime Minister, or bis Governenet,
or bis party frorn certain commitmcnts; it will
have te bring about tbe disentinuance cf a
carupaige tbat the Liberal party bas for
twenty-fix e years carried on across Canada. Irevcry clection campaign since 1917 the Liberal
party lias stressed the fact that the Coniservative party ictroduced conscription te scnd
mcen overseas. Betb by innuende and directly
the people were led te believe tbat the Liberal

party would nover invoke sucb a policy. Let
me recaîl the electiens of 1921 and 1925. It
is ictcresting te note tbat in 1925, under the
leadership cf tbe Rigbt Hon. Arthur Meigben,
tbe Conservative party won as rnany scats in
eight cf tbe provinces as it did under Mr.
Bennett je 1930. Ini 1925 tbe Censervative
party carried 112 seats eut cf 180; in 1930,

JANUARY 29, 1942
under Mr. Bennett, it carried 113. But in the
province of Quebec in 1925 only four Conservative candidates were returned, as against
twenty-four in 1930.
What were the issues in the election of 1940?
I shall give them in the order in which I think
they should come. My right honourable friend
may differ with me on that, but apart from the
one issue the order makes little difference.
The first issue was the maximum war effort.
The people of this country, rightly or wrongly,
thought that the Government of the day, being
already in the saddle and having carried on
the war effort for six or seven months, waz
better qualified than any other body to continue that effort. That is one of the reasons
why they voted for the Government in 1940.
The second issue in that election was the
issue of conscription or no conscription. In
the House of Commons in March, 1939, the
present leader of the Government said he
would not enforce conscription in this country,
or used words to that effect. The Leader of
the Opposition said that he was not in favour
of conscription in case of war. And in the
election they both adopted that policy. I
must say quite candidly that in my own part
of the country-and I think I know a little
about it-the people who were opposed to
conscription reasoned this way. They said:
"The Liberal party since 1917 has been opposed
to conscription throughout. Since 1919, when
Mr. King became the leader of the party, le
has been opposed to conscription. In 1917 Dr.
Manion, the leader of the Conservative party,
was a Liberal, and he switched to the War
Ministry, which was in favour of conscription.
If he is elected this time lie will try to resist,
but his party will overcome him. Therefore,
if we are opposed to conscription we had better
vote for Mr. King." That is the truth regarding the election in my part of the country.
In every district in Manitoba where the people
were opposed to conscription they voted almost
unanimously for the Liberal party, and that
was the issue.
The third issue was British sentiment. But
that was not a permanent issue.
Such was the political situation in March of
1940. What was the war situation at that
time? Practically speaking, there was no war
in 1940. Officially we were at war with
Germany-not yet with Italy-but there was
nothing doing. As the American writers put
it, it was a "phoney" war. In March of 1940
we were not war conscious, but by June of
1940 we were. By March of 1941 we were very
war conscious. The skies were dark and overcast, and the situation was such that if it had
not been for the innate determination of that

51

great leader Winston Churchill, it is doubtful
whether we would have carried on.
During the past year the Government has
been conducting a campaign to obtain soldiers.
We have now come to a point where it is
impossible to get recruits.
An Hon. SENATOR: No.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Yes, we are confronted
with that difficulty. If we were not having that
difficulty, does anybody in his sober senses
imagine that the Government would be asking
for a plebiscite in order to be relieved from
its problems? If soldiers were coming forward
by the thousands and hundreds of thousands
there would be no call for that. But apparently the Government thinks there is need
to be prepared for an emergency. So what
does it suggest? It suggests that it should be
relieved from its pledges. Mr. King has
good ground for saying that when a man
makes a pledge he should carry it out. I
do not deny that. But the question is: If
lie made a pledge, can he override it? It is
my contention that in 1940 that pledge to
have no conscription for overseas service was
overridden by a superior undertaking, namely
maximum war effort.
But suppose the pledge was not overridden.
We are asked to release the Prime Minister
from it. The wording of the question, which
appears in Hansard, and which I now quote
from the Winnipeg Free Press of January 27,
1942, is this:
Are you in favour of releasing the Government from any obligation arising out of any
past commitments restricting the methods of
raising men for military service?
If the majority of the people of this
country answer in the affirmative, what will
happen then? I asked that question of the
honourable senator from Essex (Hon. Mr.
Lacasse) the other day, and lis view was that
if the majority of the people voted "Yes,"
the Government would be released. But I
think we should be told by the Government
what the situation will be. I do not want any
promise; I want only to know what the
results are going to be. Is it the total vote
of Canada that is to be taken as deciding
whether the Government shall be released from
its pledge, or is the vote to be taken by
provinces or constituencies? Suppose that
two provinces in Canada give a majority of
a million in favour of release, and the other
seven provinces by a majority of seven
hundred thousand refuse it, is an over-all
majority of three hundred thousand in favour
of release to govern, or is it not?
Let me go further. Take the province of
Manitoba, which to-day has seventeen seats in

52

SENATE

Parliament. I prophesy that six of the constituencies in that province will give a majority
in favour of releasing the Government from
its commitments, and that the other eleven
will vote the other way. Furthermore, I am
persuaded that those six seats will give an
overriding majority in favour of releasing the
Government. To whom is the Prime Minister
going to listen when the legislation is brought
into Parliament? Is it reasonable to suppose
that the eleven elected representatives are
going to vote to release the Prime Minister
from his pledge? I think we ought to know
what is to be the effect of the release, and
by what standard the Prime Minister will
decide whether he is released or not. I think
we are entitied to that information.
Further, let us assume for the moment that
I am the Conservative member for Souris
in the House of Commons, and that the east
half of that constituency gives me a majority
of five hundred, whereas the west half
registers an adverse majority of four hundred.
Suppose the people in the part of the constituency that gave me my majority voted to say,
"No, we will not release the Prime Minister,"
and the majority of those in the other part
were in faveur of releasing him. To whom is
he going to listen?
Surely the people are
entitled to knov by what method the Government is going to decide whether that vote is
affirnative or negative.

Suppose-I am not suggesting for a moment
that this will be the case-but suppose the
Maritime Provinces and Quebec vote solidly
against releasing the Government, and Ontario
and the Western Provinces vote solidly in
favour of releasing it, and that in the total
there is a small majority of the people who
are in favour of release. what is the Government going to do? When the Government
brings down the bill we should have that
information.
Ve are entitied to it. Then
the people will know how tbey are voting.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: Wby can we not
bave the information now?
Hon. Mr. HAIG : I <lo not know whether the
right bonourable the leader can give us that
information. I doubt that be has it himself.
To continue: What will happen to the man
in the street or the man on the farm when he
comes to vote? Some people tell me, and I
imagine it is true, that every honourable
senator on the other side and every Government member in the other Chamber will go
out to the hibghways and by-ways and tell the
people what they are voting for. I think that
while telling the people they are voting on the
question of releasing the Government, they
should also tell them what to expect if the
Hon. Mr. HAIG.

Government is released. I do net believe
anybody appearing before a public meeting
can get away without answering the question:
'If we vote in favour of releasing the Government froin its pledge, what is Mr. King going
to do?"
If I were in favour of conscription I would
vote in faveur of releasing the Government;
if I were opposed to conscription I would vote
against releasing the Government; and I suggest to honourable members that the man in
the street and the man on the farm will do
likewise. They will not make any fine distinction. You cannot mislead the ordinary
people of this country. They are net going
to listen to Mr. Godbout's promises. They
are going to ask, "If Mr. King does net want
to bring in conscription, why does lie hold a
plebisrite now?" I think that if you go to the
mian on the ]and and talk with him, the conversation will bc somewhat like this: Yeu
will ask him. "Are you going to vote?" He
will reply, "I think I will."
If you ask,
"Are you in faveur of releasing the Government?" ie will say, "What does that mean?"
When you tell him, "That means that you
leave it to the Goverment," he will inquire,
"Does that mean the Governmxent will give
us conscription or not?" Yeu may then say:
"I don't know, but in the past Mr. King lias
never given you conscription. Can you not
depend on that?" His reply will be: "No, sir.
I have a big farîn and I have only one boy
to hielp me work it. I an going to vote
against releasing the Covernment." Do you
think that the people who are against conscription are going to vote for release? No,
they are not; it is those who are in favour
of conscription who are going to vote to
release the Covernment.
Someone said the other day that the vote
on the plebiscite would be a vote of confidence in the Governient. If I am in favour
of conscription I am going to vote in favour
of release; if I aum not. I am going to vote
against it; but whichever way my vote goes
ir, viii not be a vote of confidence. I anm
persuaded that the men and women of Canada
who will vote "Yes" believe the Covernment
should have the powcr to enact conscription,
and that those who Io not believe it should
have that poxver will vote "No." Furthermore,
I believe tiat all the arguments of distinguished men on either side will not change
the fundamental issue. It is my experience of
politics that the people know pretty well wlat
the issue is. In an election you can sometimes have a platformx of five or ten planks,
some of which will b objected to in one part
and approved in another; but on this occasion
there will be only one issue. The men to

JANUARY 29, 1942

whom I have talked and who are in favaur
of conscription think the Governmcnt should
take the responsibility. I agree with that.
1 believe the responsibility rests on the
Government and that it should submait to
Parliarnent the question, "Will you give us
this power?" My opinion is that the people
in the part of the country that I corne from
think this ought to be done. 0f course, 1
may be wrong. If I understand rightly, they

longer than 1 intended, and 1 appreciate your
attention. I ask the right honourable leader
of the House (Right Hon. Mr. Dandurand)
to remember that, after many years of service
here, ho is facing one of the crises of bis life,
and that aur country itself neyer had to dea1
with a more serious situation than it has niow.
We are en.gaged in a bitter struggle ahl over
the world. The war is not won yet, by any
mnanner of means. On the contrary, the road
that lies abead ta victory is long and hard.
We are all one hundred ýper cent behind the
Government in carrying on and in doing the
utmost we can towards the oountry's war
eff ort. We want ta do our full share in hclprng ta -uphold the fair name of Canada al
over the world.
The taking of the plebiscite will mean a
loss of time. Thou-h I ýcriticize the Governmîent for not assuming the rcsponsibility for
what should be done, yet if it feels it is taking
the proper course, I bow ta its judgment. But

Honourable
Hon. A. K. HUGESSEN:
senatara, I risc with some diffiapence ta take
part in this discussion. I ahould like in the
first place ta congratulate rny hanourable
friend wha bas just spoken, upon what I
migbt caîl bis generally dispassianate and
non-partisan review of the present position.
I hope very mucb that I ahaîl be able ta
follow him in what I say, and ta avaid
giving any offence or any evidence of political
rancour.
I want ta discuss for a few minutes the
twa questions which are now an prominently
before the country: first, that of cornpulsory
overseas service, and secondly, that ta which
the Speech from the Throne made direct
reference, the plebiscite ta be submitted ta
the people.

I listened with a gaod dýeal of attention ta
the speeches of honourable senators on the
other aide of this Chamber yesterday afternoon. While I fully agree with everything
that bas been said about the elaquence of the
honourable senator from Ottawa East (Han.
Mr. Coté), I do rather regret that he allowed
himself ta indulge in what I can only eall a
political diatribe against the present Government. I took down same of bis remarks as he
made them. lie made contemptuous referenco ta the present Goverament and the
Prime Miaister. He accused them of cajoling
for votes, of political adroitaess, of attaining
the enjoyment -of power and the sweets of
I regret that
office hy unworthy tacties.
that sort of thing ahould be said in this day
and at this haur in this House, because 1 do
nat helieve tbat this is the time for embittercd political contraversy.
Hon. B. F. SMITH: But it is truc.
Han. Mr. HUGESSEN: My hanourable
friend frarn Ottawa East went on frorn there
ta appeal ta the Government ta change its
attitude. I wonder if he really believes that
an appeal couched in those terras, and made
after bis statements about the Goverament
and the Prime Minister, will really have any
very considerable effeet. I arn reminded anmewhat of the words which Shakespeare put ino
the moutb of Ring Richard 111, in the play
of that name:
WVas ever warnan ia this humour woo'd?
Was ever woman in this humour wn?
Furthcrmare, my bonourable friend from
Ottawa East unfortunately disregarded the
advice which was given-very properly, I think
-by the honaurable leader of the other aide
of the House, bis awn leader (Han. Mr.
Ballantyne), and he went back ta the year
1917. I arn sarry that that ahould have been
donc. I think that the passions aroused in
the year 1917 had better be forgotten. They
are at best aid, unbappy, fer-off things and
battles long aga. 1 might he in a position
ta discusa 1917 with my hanourable friend for
two reasons. First, it would perbapa be apprapriate that the statements made by a Canadian of French origin frarn the province of
Ontario should he replied ta by a Canýadian
of English origin frorn the province of Quebec.
The second reasan is that et the tirne of the
1917 election, in December, Il waa with the
Canadien Expeditionary Force. I voted with
rny unit in the ruined suburbs of the town af
Ypres, and I cast rny vote in favour of the
honourable gentleman who naw leads an
the other aide of the House (Hon. Mr. Bellantyne). But I do ot intend ta go beck ta that
nid, unhappy history. One thing, though, I
wiIl say. It seerna ta me fundamentally im-

we as Canadians should see to,
possible way that there is no
future of the divisions which
in the year 1917.
SENATORS: Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. MACDONALD (Richmond-West
Cape Breton) : What were the divisions?
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: Does my honourable friend requiro an answer? Hie cao get
that from somebody else.
Hon. Mr. MA*CDONALD (Richmond-West
Cape Breton): Certainlv we want an answer.
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: I ar n ot going back
to that. What I want to say is that I fully
agree with tho honourable colleague who sits
behiind me and who sn eloquently seconded
the Address (Hon. Mr. Gouin). I said to my
honourable friend, and 1 say to everybody,
that the one thing we have to do now is to
see to it that we romain a united people, and
that those unfortunato divisions which embittered political life in thîs country for many
years zhall ot be repeated in the future.
Hon. B. F. SMITH: WVe have not very
munch unity at the prosent time.
Hon. Mr. MACDONALD (Richmond-West
Cape Breton): That does flot answer the
question about divisions. I asked about the
divisions that the bonourable gentleman reforred to, because I wanted te know what they
were and what caused them. WVe were fighting
a common enemy in 1917.
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: The honourable gentleman cao make a speech later.
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: Now I want to discuss the question of compulsory overseas
serviceHon. Mr. MACDONALD (Richmond-West
Cape Breton) : Certainly. That is the question before us.
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: I want to discuss
the question of compulsory ovorseas service in
as calta and dispassionate a way as I cao in
relation te our total war effort and, to the
available man-power that we have at our disposaI. It seemis te, me that a certain amount
of hysteria hias crept into the discussions, flot
those in this Bouse, but sonne of the discussions which we listen te, outside of this
bouse, and into some of the oewspaper articles
wbicbi we read.
That, of course, is only
natural. The war hias been going on for
more than. exo years. Men's minds are worried, thoir nerves beg-in to get frayed, and it is
ot surprising that anme formi of bysteria
sbould appcar in publie discussions. Lt were
very mucb better that this hysteria should nt
appear, but unfortunately it does.
Hon.

Mr. HUGESSEN.

I often think that the people who talk te, us
about eompulsory military service in this war
are makingý a rathet' common mistake of the
military mind. Tbey are thinking of this war
in ternis of the lest war, and that is a very
dangorous thing to do.
If yuu want an
example of the danger of tryiog to fight this
war in termis of the last war, just, rmmd
yoursclves of whiat happened to unhappy
Franco, wboso goncrals did try to do just that.
What was the fundamontal characteristie of
the last wvar? It was that vast numbers of
mon %vcre re(luired for the infaatry, armed
wvith rifles, to man a long systema of permanent
trenches. This war, in that respect, is cntirely
different.
The demands are ýdifferent, the
requiremoents arc difforcut; the requiremonts of
man-powor, in particular, are different. I think
the differcoce can bco epitemizcd. perhaps, in
that one word moc'hanization. This time there
are far smaller numbers of men at the front,
and enorrnously larger numbers of machines.
We have been told that modern warfare
requircs from ton te fifteen mon behind the
lino, working in factories, for overy fully
armed and fullv equippod soldier at tbe front.
If you compare Canada's part in the last
war witlh Cauada's part in titis war you wilI
son wherein the difference lies. Io the last
wvar our- principal contribution xvas virtually
conflned ýte the raising of a large army. 0f
course, wo did produce a grout deai of fond and
a very large number ef shelîs. But the army
and mon for the army were the principal
demaod, and it was a demand which was
filled. What is the demand upon Canada's
mao-powor in the presont war? It is vory
much more divorsified and veory much more
serious.
Take the things we are called upon te do
as oiîr contribution te the common cause. We
have to produce vast quantities of fond. Our
mIle in thiat respect is very much more important than it was in the last war, because then
Great Britain hacl access to the markets of
Denmark and a large part cf continental

nover before imagined te act as a tremendous
arsenal, net onîy for Britain, but for aIl the
(lemecracies who are figlitinig on the common
front. Figures have been givon me te the
effeet that the number of Canadians actually
engagcd i 0 our munitions industries at the
presont timo is somewhiere between 600,000 and
750.000. In the third place, we bave been
called upon te provide and man perhaps the
largest military air training soheme that the

have been called upon te build, to equip and
te man a navy on both our Atlantic and our

55

JANUARY 29, 1942
Pacific shores. As was said a few moments
ago by the honourable senator from Winnipeg
South-Centre (Hon. Mr. Haig), everyone
knows now that the war is at our shores and
realizes how important it is and has been
to keep our Navy at the greatest strength
possible. Then, of course, we have to provide
an Active Army both for service overseas and
at home, as well as a great number of men for
maintenance of the ordinary services of
Canada. Let me remind honourable members
that in a very large and widely extended
country such as this, with a colparatively
small population, it needs a fairly large proportion of our man-power to keep those
ordinary services in operation.
That is the man-power problem with which
we are faced in this war, and honourable
senators will see how vastly it differs from the
man-power problem which faced us in the last
war. As I have said, there are to-day much
larger demands on our man-power, and they
are made in many more directions than they
were between 1914 and 1918. Having those
facts in mind, I believe it is true to say that
the provision of men for our overseas Army
is relatively less important now than it was
at that time. I do not wish to be misunderstood. I would be the last man to say that
Canada should confine her efforts to producing food and munitions. Our boys are redblooded, they want to go out and fight just
as their fathers did before them, and no man
and no government which tried to prevent
them from doing so would have a moment's
chance. But I do say that the actual provision
of men for the Army is not relatively as
important at the present time as it was during
the last struggle.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: Surely the bonourable senator is not serious in saying there
is less demand for men in this world war than
in the last war? He must know there is a
great demand for men.
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: There is certainly
not less demand, but the demand is in different
directions from what it was. I will deal with
my honourable friend's statement in a moment
or two. Let me take his suggestion of two
days ago that this country should send an
expeditionary force to Australia or the Far
East. I wonder whether that would be the
best way in which the efforts of this country
could be directed. I remember at the beginning
of last week listening in Montreal to a most
interesting speech given before the Canadian
Club by the High Commissioner for India in
the United States. He talked about the war
effort of India, and told us that that country
was producing a certain number of the more

elementary munitions of war, and that so far
it had raised a million men for the Army.
"But," he said, "with our warlike races in
India we could raise 8,000,000 men if we had
the munitions, supplies and equipment for
them."
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: He concluded his
remarks with an appeal to the United States
and to this country to provide India with more
planes, tanks and munitions to equip those
8,000,000 men. Now I do suggest to my honourable friend who leads on the other side
(Hon. Mr. Ballantyne) that it would be far
better for Canada to continue the man-power
we are now employing in providing munitions
and supplies and the ships to carry them to
those men in the Far East, rather than
attempt to send an expeditionary force there.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: That is one
example of the difficulty of determining the
best manner in which the man-power of this
country can be applied.
What is our present man-power problem?
As the honourable senator from Winnipeg
South-Centre (Hon. Mr. Haig) bas said, we
have had so far no trouble in providing men
for the Air Force and the Navy. Up to the
present we have been able to provide all the
men that our greatly expanded war industries
have required. But it is a different story in
regard to agriculture. And let me remind
honourable members that agriculture is a
tremendously essential part of our war effort.
I happen to know that in two different
sections of the country agricultural labour
is becoming very scarce. In that part of
Northern New Brunswick where I happen
to have a summer cottage, and where, incidentally, the French-speaking and the
English-speaking populations are about evenly
divided and have equally enlisted in very
large numbers for overseas service, agricultural labour is becoming very scarce. The
same is true of the Eastern Townships.
Hon. A. L. BEAUBIEN:
Canada.

And Western

Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: I noticed in the
newspapers this morning reports which lead
me to believe that that is true of other
sections of Canada. There is a suggestion
to-day by the Director of Farm Training in
the Ontario Department of Labour that the
Federal Government should import Italian
war prisoners to help as Canadian farm
labourers. The reason why the importation
of farm labourers is necessary is, as he says,

56

SENATE

that out of nine hundred farms that he had
visited only forty wero planning increased
production for the coniing season, while
many were considering a decreased outputa situation dtte alnost entirely to the difficulvty of obtaining labour.
To-day's Ottawa Citizen contains a report
of a speech by Mr. Hannam, president of
the Federation of Agriculture. He said:
lie challenge of increased production to
-Agriculturecould only be metincreased production for war purposes as
part of our war contribution-by
long-term postpoiierneiits froui military
training for key mec on farcis.
I come now to the question of our overseas
Army. Frankly, I do not as yet know, and
I do not think it will be known for some
lime, whether the systen of voluntary recruitment for the overseas Army is becoming
insufficient or net. It certainly bas not been
insufficient up to the present time. I am as
eager as any lionourable member liere to see
our overseas Army supported. I an in much
the same position as two honourable senators
who have already spoken, particularly the
honourable senator from Winnipeg SouthCentre, because ny eldest son is in the Canadian Air Force at the age of eighteen. My
feeling is that, in view of the great demand
from all these different directions upon our
available man-power, we shall net be able to
increase our present overseas forces to any
great degrce.
What we can do, it seenis to me, is what
lias been suggestd in tlie Speech from the
Throne: we can mechanize our overseas
forces to a greater degree than they have
alreadv been mecianizedl; but I doubt whether
we i-an largcly increase tliose forces. This
being the case, I think we ought to try to
visualize this question of conscription in its
proper proportions. I do net believe if is
nearly as important a part of our war effort
as we have sometimes been led to believe by
the highly paid agitations that have been
going on during the last few weeks. I would
suggiest that in the event of conscription for
overscas coming into effect, what will happen
will be this: the men who are now being
called up and trained by conscription for
home service will be made available for reinforcements wherever wanted, either in Canada
or overseas. It will amount to that; nothing
more and nothing less.
If I am right in that -point of view, then I
should like to challenge the statement made
by the honourable senator from Peterborough
(Hon. Mrs. Fallis) yesterday, when she talked
about the evil effect of the delay of three or
four months whieh would result from the
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN.

proposed plebiscite. Tliere will, I submit, be
no evil effects. If after the plebiscite has
been taken the Government decides that conpulsory service is necessary for overseas, the
men who will have been called up will be
undergoing their four months' training and
they will be available, just as they are at
present available for the defence of Canada.
I have a few more references to make to
th second brandi of the subject I wish te
discuss this afternoon, the proposed plebiscite. The honourable senator from Winnipeg
South-Centre referred to the statement made
by the Prime Minister in 1939. It was not
made only then.
I intend to read four
lifferent statements by the Prime Minister.
The first statement is that of March 30, 1939,
to which the honourable senator referred. It
is in these words:
The

prosent Government

believes that con-

s-ription of mon for overseas service would not
be a necessary or an effective stop. Lot me
say that so long as this Government may be in
powor, no such measure will be enacted.

The second was made at the outbreak of
war on September 8, 1939:
I wish now to repeat the undertaking I gave
in Parliament on belalf of the Governîment on

March 30 last. The present Government believes
that conscription of men for overseas service
will iot be a necessary or ait effective step.
No such imeasure will be introduced by the
present Administration.

The third, mark yon, was made after the
election of March, 1940. On June 17, following. the Prime Minister said:
Once again I wish to repeat ny undertaking,
frequently given, that no measure for the conscription of men for overseas service will be
introduced by the present Administration.
And tIis is the fourth statement, made on
June 20, 1940-three days later:
Those (election candidates) who were anticonscriptionist were against conscription for
overseas service, and as long as this Government
is in office we are going to maintain that

position and sec that effect is given to it.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: Shame on then!

Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: How can any honourable menber say to this House that that
pledge was not off repeated? It is net like
the statements cited yesterday by the honourable senator from Ottawa East (Hon. Mr.
Coté), made during the heat of an election.
It is an oft-repea,ted pledge given by the
present Government, and I submit that the
only honourable way the Goverrnment can
escape fron that pledge is to do exactly what
it proposes -to do-ask the people for a release.
I am amazed at the suggestion of some honourable members that a solemn covenant of
that kind can be repudiated at the sole wish or
desire or whim of the person who gave it.

57

JASNUARY 29, 1942
Surely what we are fighting for in 'this war is
to bring back a world in which solemnly given
pledges shall be respected.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, 'hear.
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: Otherwise we are
simply lowering ourselves to the level of Mr.
Adolph Schicklgruber.
I hope, honourable senators, that nothing I
have said will give offence to anyone. I have
tried flot to introduce any element of political
oontroversy, but to confine myseif to what in
my imperfect judgment appear to be the
present facts of the matter.
One hast thing I wish to say, and, that is
that Canada so far has made a magnificent war
eff ort.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: We on both sides
of this flouse are proud of it. We are capable
of doing even"more. But do nlot let us spoil
the effort we already have made by beginning
to quarrel about one part of it and by injecting divisions, discussions and dissensions into
the different parts of our country. After ahi,
we ail have the same end in view, the same
object to serve-the winning of this war; and
I do hope that we shall be able, conscientiously
and without division, without the bitterncss
which so unfortunately injected itself twentyByve years ago, to arrive at a decision in this
matter which will meet the conscience and the
judgment of the vast majority of the people
of this country.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: Honourable
senators, I want to assure you at once that I
arn not rising to make a speech. 1 aiready
have exhausted my right to do so. Ail I desire
is, with the leave of the Senate, to be permitted to move an amendment to the Address
in reply to the Speech from the Throne; an
amendment which was not completed when I
last spoke. If the Senate will allow me, I shahl
move the amendment, and say not a word
about it.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Right Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: 1 think we
ail realize that we shouid adhere to, the rules of
the Senate rather more closely than 'has been
our habit in the past, and should apply them as
fairly, as honestly and as equitably as we
can. We should not, as bas been the practice
in years gone by, make two or three or even
four speeches on the same question.
I have no objection to my honourable friend
crystaliizing the conclusion of his speech in
an amendment, on the understanding, of
course, that it wilI not bo taken as a iprecedent.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: I thank you
very much. honourable senators.
I move, seconded by Hon. Senator Haig,
the following amendment to the motion now
before the House:
That the following paragraph be added to
the Address:
The Senate regrets that by the insertion in
the Speech from the Throne of a paragraph
setting forth the intention of the Governmcnt
to seek release from an electoral pledge Your
Excellency's advisers are taking a stand contrary to the spirit of our parliaxnentary institutions and to the principle of ministeria]
responsibility.
The proposed ameodment was negatived.
and the Address was adopted.
ADJOURNMENT 0F THE SENATE
Right Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Honourable senators, it is now my duty, in accordance with tradition, to move the adjournment
of the flouse. It has been our custom, after
the adoption of the Address and the formation
of committees, to adjourn the Senate for
some time in order to enable the Commons to
deal with legislation which eventuaily would
reach us here. After due consideration of what
may ho expected from the labours of the
other flouse, I would move, seco.nded by Hon.
Mr. Euler, subject to the authority given His
Honour the Speaker to recaîl us if an emergency arises, that when the Senate adjourns
to-day it do stand adjourned until Tuesday,

THE LATE SENATOR GORDON
TRIBUTES TO HIS MEMORY

HonaurRight Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
able senators, it is my sorrowful duty'ta draw
officialiy ta the attention oi the Senate the
departure ai one ai aur coileagues, Senator
Gardon, who had been with us for many years.
Bis movements and appearance would nat

ead one ta suppose he had passed the mark
ai three score years and ten, but I find hie was
born in 1865. 1 had been an famiiiar ternis
with hlm ever since hie came ta the Senate.
He was weli informed on many questions, and,
both bei-e and in aur committees, frequentiy
gave us the advantage ai bis knowledge and
experience.
Born and brouglit up in the upper Ottawa
vailey, hie became a lumber merchant and later
achieved success as a iumher manufacturer.
He was always interested in everything per-

59

taining to the development of our forests, particulariy in regard fa transportation, which
affected him. vitally in bis business, and we
always listened to him with considerable
interest.
The last conversation 1 had *with him
occuirred when the members of the Senate had
the pleasiire of meceting in the rooms of His
ilanaur the Speaker after the recent presentation to me -of a hust. That conversation was
a most agreceabie and hopeful one. In repiy
to my statement that most of the senators
arudme, being younger than 1, would

attend the ceiebration of *my one hundredth
anniversary, Senator Gordon said hie was
piedging himseif ta be present. I have had
occasion ta rernark that many of my contemporaries disappeared between the ages of
thirty-five and sixty-five, and that anyone who
biad passed that ýcriticai period would seem. to
be ,Iustified by the actuariai tables in hoping
ta reach his eightieth year. But we neyer
know when we shall be cailed, and hardiy
a week after my conversation with hlm the
late senator fell by the wayside.
In the name of the Senate I tender our
very warmn sympathy to his widow and the
members of Senator Gordons family, who by
death are beref t of a husband and father.
There is littie I can add, because I did not
know Senatar Gordon intimately in a social
way. There are, however, members of the
Senate who had close contact with him, an-d
they wili desire ta speak on this occasion.
Hon. C. C. BALLANTYNE: Honourable
senatars, an occasion such as this is aiways
tinged with ýsorraw, but the circumstances of
the passing ai Senatar Gardon are particulariy
sad. It does seemi tragic that only a few days
aiter meeting him here in bis usuai good
health and jovial spirits, with a cheery word
foar everybody and a warmn shake ai the hand,
we shauld suddenly be advised that he had
been stricken down and was no more. I had
not known. Senator Gordon as :long as had
the right lionotîrahie leader oi this House, but
during the iast ten years 1 certainly enjoyed
the -priviiege of associating with hiým.
His passing is a distinct ioss not only ta
this Cham-ber, but ta Canada as a whole.
Senator Gardon certainly must be considered
one af the builders ai Canada. He conmmenced
bis business life at a very early age, and in
time, by means ai perseverance, abiiity and
integrif y, became the owner oi one of the
largest businesses oi its kind in this country.
Canada aiways needs such men, particulariy
at the present time.
Senator Gordon was experienced in finance.
H1e was a director of one of aur iargest and
most important banks, as weil as of many

60

SENATE

other institutions, and his sound knowledge
and judgment were always greatly sought
after.
There was another side to Senator Gordon's
character. I refer to his charitableness. I am
informed that be gave largely, net only of
his time, but also of his wealth to institutions
of all kinds, regardless of race or creed. In
the community where be lived he was highly
respected, and his passing will be deeply
mourned.
I join with my right honourable friend in
expressing the deepest sympathy of honourable
senators on this side of the House to Mrs.
Cordon and the other members of the family.
Hon. J. J. DONNELLY: Honourable senators, may I add a few words to what has
been so well expressed by the two leaders of
the Senate? I am fully in agreement with
everytbing they have said.
My first recollection of the late senator is
of the time wien be was elected to the House
of Commons, in 1908. I was a member of
the Commons at that time, and during that
parliament my relations with Mr. Gordon
were very pleasant. He was re-elected in
1911, but shortly afterwards resigned, and in
1912 was called to the Senate. I wias transferred from the Commons to the Senate in
1913; so for more than twenty-eight years I
was rather closely associated with our late
colleague. For the last ten years we were
deskmates.
As has been pointed out by both leaders,
Senator Gordon was a very successful lumberman. In his early days lie was associated
with the late J. R. Booth. Afterwards he
started on bis own, and by bis rare good
judgment and industry he built up what at
the time of his death was, if net the largest,
one of the largest and best organized of the
lumber industries in the province of Ontario.
During the past forty years he was a very
extensive employer of labour, and I never
heard that he at any time had any serious
labour trouble with bis men. He took such a
personal interest in all his employees that
they thought, not that they were working for
George Cordon, but that they were working
with him. One result of this is that many of
the men working in the Cordon industries
have been employed there for a long term
of years.
Besides being a very successful lumberman
and business man, the late senator had another
quality, which perhaps was not so well
known. The honourable leader on this side
(Hon. Mr. Ballantyne) has referred to it. I
have been assured by many people in North
Bay that Senator Gordon gave generously to
every worthy cause that was brought to his
attention. The day after the late senator
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE.

died a friend of mine met a lady on a street
in North Bay, who told him that as a
canvasser for a deserving local charity she
had called at the senator's office to sell a
ticket, but instead she was given a cheque for
S100, and told that his name was net to be
mentioned in connection with the gift. She
felt, though, that in fairness to his memory
the incident should be mentioned.
As the honourable leader on this side of
the House has said, Senator Cordon's givings
were net in any way influenced by race or
creed. A thrifty Scotch Presbyterian, he was
at the time of his death Chairman of the
Governors of St. Joseph's Hospital, a Catholic
institution, at North Bay. He was not merely
an honorary chairman; he was very active in
his work on belialf of that institution. I have
been assured by the Reverend Mother who
lad charge of that hospital for a number of
years that his sound judgment was of very
great assistance, and that lie had also been
very generous with financial assistance to the
hospital. I know that people of all denominatiens at North Bay appreciated his generosity
and thoughtfulness.
I shall always remember Senotor Gordon as
a kindly Christian gentleman.
I feel his
passing very deeply, and I also feel grateful
for having had the privilege of being associated with him for so many years. He is
survived by Mrs. Cordon, three daughters and
one son. Early in the war the son volunteered
for active service, and he is now overseas. I
join witlh both leaders and all our colleagues
in conveying to Mrs. Gordon and members of
the family our deepest sympathy.
Hon. G. V. WHITE: Honourable senators,
having known our deceased colleague for almost
balf a century, and probably more intimately
than any other honourable member of this
Chamber did, I should like to add my tribute
to the memory of a man whose friendship I
valued very highly. As the right bonourable
leader of the House (Right Hon. Mr. Dandurand) has said, Senator Gordon was a native
of the Ottawa valley, having been born in the
village of Pakenham. When he was a lad be
came with lis parents to Pembroke, where be
received his education and spent his early manhood. His parents were Scotch; so be was a
descendant of that indomitable race which has
pioneered in so many sections of this country.
After leaving school he procured employment
with a lumber company, and went to the woods
to familiarize himself with the various phases
of the lumber industry.
At the beginning of the present century,
having acquired some large timber limits in the
north country, Mr. Cordon and his associates
erected a large sawmill at Cache Bay, on the

61

MARCH 3,1942
shores of lake Nipissing, and in order ta give
personal supervision ta lis business he took
up residence near this place. Visualizing the
vast potentialities of the north country in bath
timber and minerai resources, he became identified on a large scale with the development
of that territory. Bis business prospered, liecause of efficient management, and, as has been
saidý, he became one of the largest lumber
operatars in that section of Canada.
In 1904 he was induced by his political
friends ta become a candidate for the Bouse
of Commons in the constituency of Nipissing,
where he resided. Defeated by a samewhat
small majarity in bis first venture ta win a seat
in Parliament, he was undaunted and agamn
offered himaself as a candidate in 1908. On that
occasion he was elected, as well as in the
general election of 1911.
After the electian af 1911 Sir Robert Borden,
desirous of giving representation in his Gavernment ta that north country, which was rapidly
developing, offered the portfolio of Minister of
Railways to the Bon. Frank Cochrane, wha at
that time was a member of Sir James Whitney's
Government in Ontario; and it becamne necessary ta procure a seat in the Bouse of Commons for Mr. Cochrane. In order that the
new Minister miglit represent the same constituency in the Commons as he had represenýted in the Legisiature, George Gardon
resigned bis seat as the federal member for
Nipissing. As has been said, he was then
appointed ta the Senate. That was in 1912;'
s0 ýhe was a member of this Hause, a prominent
member, for same thirty years.
Because of his keen business ability and
sound judgment, George Gardon had many
other interests apart from bis lumber business.
Be was on the boards of numerous praminent
Canadian campanies, and was a director of
one of aur leading banks. He was a profaund
believer in the maintenance of aur democratic
institutions. Be was an ardent Britisher, a
patriotie Canadian, a layai and generous friend.
Bis passing will be deeply mourned by many
people thraughaut the length and breadth of
this cauntry. I desire ta assaciate myseIf with
the previaus speakers in off ering sincere sympathy ta his famiiy.

on the Table a statement of replies ta some
inquiries that I had put on the Order Paper
severai weeks aga. I observe at the battom
of the introductory page this statement:
To stand as *an order for a xeturn, tabled

The Secretary of State, I presumne. I presume
alsa that lie sa signed the returu s a matter
of routine, without thinking. If I arn in errar,
I shouid lîke ta have it explained ta me what
authority the Secretary of State bas ta dictate
ta this Bouse whether a reply shahl le in

they have some ruie regarding sucli matters.

SENATE

But it does not affect us; we make our own
rules, so far as I understand, and we do not
take our rulings from them.
Right Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: When my
honourable friend says "from them," is he
referring to the Secretary of State or to the
Commons?
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: The Secretary of
State.
Hon. Mr. TANNER: I am not saying that
the Secretary of State did this with his mind
on the subject. I fancy he just signed the
return as a matter of course, not thinking;
but I am entering a protest now for fear this
method might be repeated.
Now, there is nothing in the return that
could be prejudicial to the country; nothing
wha tever; but it does contain information that
would be of interest to a considerable number
of people. I would ask my right honourable
friend the leader of the House to have the
return printed in the Senate Hansard, in order
that the answers may reach people who want
to know about these things.
Right Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Will my
honourable friend kindly pass the document
over to me, so that I may see whether there
was any justification for transforming the
inquiry into an order for a return.
Hon. Mr. TANNER: I do not think there
is any reason for that at all. As to the question about tanks they say it is not in the
public interest to tell. There is a full reply
to the question about the building of cargo
ships. On the question about the construction
of trainer aircraft in Canada there is no
information; they say it is not in the public
interest to give any information. As to the
question regarding fighter aircraft and bomber
aircraft there is no answer. There is nothing
in the document that could be prejudicial.
I shall send it over to the right honourable
gentleman.

Mr. Copp be appointed to replace Hon. Mr.
Gordon on the committee.
The motion was agreed to.
BUSINESS OF THE SENATE
Right Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Honourable senators, I am still expecting the important Bill for which we reconvened yesterday,
and I would suggest that the House adjourn
during pleasure, until, say, four-thirty o'clock,
to meet at the call of the church-the bell.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: The church?
Right Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I said
"the church," perhaps, because the six months'
hoist is being moved by a gentleman of that
name in the other House. We shall reconvene at the call of the Chair.
After consulting with my honourable friend
the leader on the other side, my idea is this:
if the Bill comes to us before six o'clock, and
if the Senate is agreeable, we could open discussion of the principle of the Bill on the
second reading at eight o'clock this evening
in order to advance matters. Our discussions,
of course, are not as lengthy as those in the
other House. If we followed the lead of that
House, we should perhaps be here until the
end of March. I do not anticipate that that
will be the case, however. I would move,
seconded by the Right Hon. Mr. Graham,
that the Senate adjourn during pleasure.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: It is moved by
Rigbt Hon. Mr. Dandurand, seconded by
Right Hon. Mr. Graham, that the Senate
adjourn during pleasure.
Right Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I find that
I am mistaken as to the name of the member
who is moving the six months' hoist in the
other Chamber.
The motion was agreed to, and the Senate
adjourned during pleasure.
After some time the sitting of the Senate was
resuned.
DOMINION PLEBISCITE BILL
FIRST READING

Right lon. Mr. DANDURAND: Honourable senators, whcn the striking committee
organized the various standing committees of
this House it endeavoured as far as possible
to give each of the four areas of the country
fairly equal representation. The province of
Ontario, which Lad thirteen representatives
on the Standing Committee on Banking and
Commerce, bas lost one member through the
death of Hon. Mr. Gordon.
This leaves
twelve members from Ontario, the same numHon. Mr. TANNER.

A message was received fron the House of
Commons with Bill 10, an Act respecting the
taking of a plebiscite in every electoral district
in Canada and the taking of the votes at such
plebiscite of Canadian Service voters stationed
within and without Canada.
The Bill was read the first time.
SECOND READING
The Hon. The SPEAKER: When shall this
Bill be read the second time?

MARCH 4, 1942
Right Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: With the
leave of the Senate, I would move that the
Bill le now read the second time. My suggestion is tbat we do not proceed with deba te
on this motion until eight o'clock tbis evening.
The Bill bas just corne over to us, after having
been given third reading by the otber buse.
I arn sure ail honourable members are
familiar with the ten sections of the measure,
as original]y worded, but they may not be
aware of the various arnendments that have
beýen made. Between the present bour and
eight o'clock tbey will bave plenty of tirne to
study tbis Bill as finally passed by the Coinmons. I intend to make a f ew rernarks on
the Bill, and I would ask His Honour the
Speaker to call it six o'clock.
The Hon. Tbe SPEAKER: On the understanding that we are to resurne at eigbt o'clock
tbis evening to take up the motion for second
reading of this Bill, I now declare it six o'clock
and leave the Cbair.
At six o'clock the Senate took recess.

were to-day in power, tbeir Government would
do iust what tbe members of tbe present
Government think sbould lie done: that is to
say, having given a pledge, not to Parliarnent,
but to the people of Canada, their Governrnent would deern it a duty to ask the people
to release it frorn that pledge.
It rnay lie said, indeed ut bas been said,
that there are two otber ways of consulting the
people: either by dissolving Parliament and
going direct to, tbe electorate for endorsation
of tbe new policy, or by instituting a referendum. Between tbealternative of dissolving
Parliament and going to tbe people to obtain
a righit wbieh can be exercised, but which rnay
not lie for a time, indeed may neyer be, and
the necessity of doing a thing wbicb mnust in a
certain event follow a referendum, there is a
large margin. The Prime Minister bas more
than once expressed bis view that at the
present time tbere is no neýcessity for enlargiag
tbe scope of tbe compulsory principle so that
it would apply to soldiers to serve abroad. In
tbree or four speeches from bis place in the
buse of Commons bie bas repeated that bie

Now, this plan has been accepted by the
popular Huse, and the evidence of the fect
is the Bil h ,bich has corne from that bouse
to-day. In the face of that decision by the
peple's representativcs in the other House it

join in relieving the Government frorn the

that the Governent should be relieved of
the pledge it gave in 1940.
Witb these vcry few remarks I move,
seconded by the Right Hon. Mr. Graham,
that the Bill be now reed a second tirne.
Hon. C. C. BALLANTYNE: Honourable

hunourable friend upon the brevity of bis
speech, and elso upon baving gone further
tban the Prime Minister or any other Minister
in enother place bas gene. If I understood
tbe riglit bonourable gentleman correctly, bie
said thet if the Government were relieved of

that is what bie meant-to any part-

I understood the right bonourable gentleman,
but if hie seys bie did net say that, I wiii
withdraw.
Right Hon. Mr. DANDIJRAND.

Rigbt Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Will the
honourable gentleman repeat, so that I may
understand, wbat bie believes I did say?
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: I understood
the right bonourable gentleman to say that if
the Government were relieved of the unfortunate promise they made in 1940Rigbt Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: That we
aIl made.
Hon. Mr. BKLLANTYNE: I will corne te
tbat.
Hon. Mr. DAVID: Liberels, Conservetives
and C.C.F.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: -the Government then would teke whetever measures
were necessery f0 send men wherever they
might be needed, without designeting Canada
only. Am I rigbt in that, ur aum I wroug?
Right Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Would
tbe bonourable gentleman repeat the lest
phrase?
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: I understood
the rigbt bonourable gentlemen to say that
our armed forces would net be lirnited te the
defence of Canada alene, but would be sent
wherever they were needed, providcd the
Governrnent were relieved of their prernise.
Riglit bon. Mr. DANDURAND: I said that
the Government, freed frem that pledge,
would, whenever circumstances dictated,
examine into the necessity of helping wherever
the interests of Canada were deerned to be
vital.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: Quite so. That
bears eut wbat I said. The necessities of
Canada are in ail the theatres of war. Ex'ery
shot fired et the enerny in this war, ne metter
in whet field of battle, whether on the sea, on
the land or in the air, bas been fired in the
defence of Canada; and I arn gled te flnd so
early in this debete that the right bonourable
gentleman and myself are in complete accord.
Now I corne f0 the 1940 election. It is f0 be
regretted that this promise, or commitrnent,
as it is usually called, wes made by eitber

Mr. King or Mr. Menion. 1 neyer could see
the necessity for any such cornmitment. The
country at that time wes et war. The King

power with a very large mai erity-es they

bave been returned to power, the serne statement wouid apply f0 bim. Now, in the third
year of the war, the Government find public
opinion rising; they find the Press of Canada
demanding a more vigorous wer policy than
we bave et the presenit time. Althougb, te be

MARCH 4,1942
fair, I must say the Government have done
excellent work in a great many ways, the
public feel that more ought to be done, and
it is that feeling, I suppose, that has caused
the Government to decide on this anaemic
Bill calling for a plebiscite.
When the Speech from the Throne was being
debated I had the honour of moving that the
following paragraph be added to the Address:
The Senate regrets that by the insertion in
the Speech from the Throne of a paragraph
setting forth ithe intention of the Government
to seek release from an electoral pledge Your
Excellency's advisers are taking a stand contrary to the spirit of our pariamentary institutions and to the principle of ministerial
responsibility.
We on this side still adhere to what was stated
in that proposed amendment, although it was
lost on division. Under our constitutional
form of government all governments, in peace
or in war, must assume the responsibility of
dealing with the problems which come before
them. They have to solve those problems and
then come before Parliament and stand or
fall by what they have done. The present
Government, however, found themselves in an
uncomfortable position. I read the speech
of the Prime Minister, in one part of which
he stated that Canada was in what he called,
I think, an unfair position, by reason of the
feeling of our Allies that they were engaged in
an all-out effort and we were not; and he
expressed the view that the time had arrived
to ask the people to free the Government
so that they might take more active measures.
My right honourable friend (Right Hon.
Mr. Dandurand) has stated that the public
clearly understand the meaning of this plebiscite. If that is so, all I can say is that I
and the people I have met and talked to are
very mueh more dense than the public of
Canada, for I can make neither head nor
tail of it. There is not a single commitment
here. The Government are asking an intelligent Parliament and an intelligent people to
vote for this thing which means nothing at
all; and when the Prime Minister and other
Ministers in another place were pressed to say
what action they would take if the plehjscite
carried, the answer was merely, "Trust the
Government." If the people of Canada know
what steps the Government are going to take
should the vote be "Yes," they have far more
intelligence than I should have thought it
possible for anyone to possess in regard to
this matter when the Government have not
indicated in the slightest degree what they are
going to do.
The difference between the Government and
the senators on this side of the House is that
in view of the very serious war situation which

65

exists to-day we believe there is no need whatever for this plebiscite. I say nothing about
the occupied countries now dominated by the
Nazis, but when we consider that within the
short space of two months we have lost the
great naval base of Singapore, the great and
rich country of Malaya, the Dutch East Indies
and part of Burma, and that Australia and
New Zealand are threatened, time surely
means something. Yet, while so great a war
is raging, the Government are going to present
a plebiscite to the people of Canada. I read
the speech by the Secretary of State, and
learned that after the Bill is passed in Parliament some ten weeks more will elapse before
the vote is taken. I presume it will be some
time in June or July before all the returns
are in from the whole of Canada and from
overseas and the Government know the final
results of the voting. The seriousness of the
war demands immediate action, yet all this
time is going to, be wasted. This long process
of taking a plebiscite is to be followed, with
the appointment of returning officers, deputy
returning officers, enumerators, poll clerks, and
so on, at a cost to the country of $1,500,000,
whereas the whole thing could have been
avoided if the Government had followed a
constitutional and proper course, which I think
was the only course to follow.
I have been reading a little about the United
Kingdom, to see whether a plebiscite was ever
taken over there, and I have found that in
all the hundreds of years since the Mother
Country has had parliamentary institutions
there never was a plebiscite. If the seriousness
of the war situation had been placed before
honourable members of the other House by the
Prime Minister of Canada, in a vigorous speech,
as he is so well qualified to do it, then, to quote
his own words, which I have just read, Parliament would have freed his hands. Why was
that course not pursued? "Oh," the Prime
Minister says, "I made a promise not only to
Parliament, but to the people, and there is a
moral as well as a legal side to the question."
He was tremendously impressed with the moral
side of the question, and that is the reason for
putting this plebiscite to the people and in
consequence delaying by nine months, or probably a year, the taking of further vigorous
action for the prosecution of the war.
If the vote on the plebiscite is an overwhelming "Yes," then there will be more delay.
Should the Government decide there is need
for compulsorily sending men to theatres of
war outside of Canada, there will have to
be a debate in Parliament. Well, by the time
all the ballots are in, Parliament may not be
in session. In that event we shall have to
wait until Parliament is assembled again, and

44567-5

then wait until the debate is finished; and
Goodness only knows what state the war may
be in by that time. With the mechanized
forces that ail the warring countries have now,
armies move rapidly, and decisions must be
made quickly. I cannot understand how a
Government carrying the responsibilities that
our Government carry to-day could have failed
to follow the constitutional course of getting
parliamentary authority for prompt action,
and then taking whatever steps they deemed
necessary.
I want to say to my right honourable friend
(Right Hon. Mr. Dandurand), who comes from
the same city as I do, that the majority of the
people of this country were shocked and depressed when they beard that a plebiscite was
to be taken on this question. Many people
have spoken to me about it. A large number
of them have told me they think they had
better vote "Yes," but they do not know what
action the Covernment intend to take afterwards if released from their pledge. I say,
speaking not only for this side of the House,
but, I believe, for the majority of the people
in CanadaRigbt Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
not quite certain.

That is

Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: Yes, I think
it is. I say we are depressed, indeed, and
dissatisfied, because the Government are proceeding by this circuitous method instead of
acting in a constitutional way and appealing
direct to Parliament.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Would my honourable friend allow me?
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE:

Certainly.
Rigbt Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: My honourable friend bas cited the Prime Minister,
but without quoting a statement that he made.
We have full power to raise al] the men
required for the defence of Canada on our
own territory. We shal seek to do the right
thing under our obligations to help defend
our neighbour at both ends of the country.
And at the prosent time more men are being
enlisted for sertvice abroad than we can train
or equip. So no time is being lost just
now by this procedure which my honourable
friend says will cause undue delay in our war
effort.
Hon. Mr. DAVID: Will my honourable
friend allow me just a question?
As a
Canadian, in his heart, in bis soul, does he
believe that asking the opinion of the people
through a plebiscite is democratie or antidemocratic?
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: That is not the
question I was discussing in this honourable
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE.

Chamber. I was discussing the constitutional
way in which a government should proceed
when they are carrying the responsibilities that
our Government now carry. Of course we all
know that we are living under a democratic
system. I say to the Governm ent: "Instead
of leading the people, you are asking the
people to lead or advise you." And I ask
the Government this question: "Why should
you deviate from the constitutional way of
doing things that bas been followed for so
many hundreds of years by the Mother
Country?" My honourable friend from Sorel
(Hon. Mr. David) will not deny that it will
be six or seven months before we know the
results of this plebiscite. Can we and the
Allies afford to wait so long? And then can
we afford to wait until Parliament is called
and a great many speeches are made for or
against any action proposed by the Government?
My right honourable friend (Right Hon.
Mr. Dandurand) is more experienced in parliamentary and publie affairs than I am. He
knows that governments must be strong and
must lead, especially in war time, and that
when a government show solidity and strength
of leadership the people will follow. If my
right honourable friend wants to discuss the
military situation, J could take issue with bim.
Perhaps I should do so briefly, since he suggests there is no difficulty in getting men. But
for the fact that I do not want to take up the
time of the House, I could quote the opinion
of General Panet, of General Vanier and of
Recruiting Officer Scott, ail diametrically
opposed to wbat bas been said on the floor
in another place and bore to-night. Voluntary
recruiting bas absolutely broken down. That
is one of the reasons why the Government
are submitting this plebiscite.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Oh, no.
Right Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Hon. Mr. Ralston does not say that.

The

Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE:
My hounourable friend from Wellington (Hon. Mr.
Howard) shakos his head.
What did the
Minister of Defence say a few nights ago?
He said that if he noticed a lag in raeruiting
he would adopt some other measure. I do
not want to get into a debate on that, because
I think I must adhere to this plebiscite Bill;
but I will say if my good friend the Minister
of Defence cannot notice a lag in recruiting,
a great many others can.
I have only this further to add. My right
honourable friend Mr. Meighen, not long ago,
in the course of a speech, said the Conservative party was ready to serve inside the Government or outside. I reiterated bis statement

MARCH 4, 1942
when I was speaking on the Address. I repeat
it to-night. The Government have shown no
evidence whatever that they desire the assistance of the Conservative party inside. That
being so, let me conclude by saying: we have
no desire to impede or retard the Government's war effort, andi outside we will do all
that we possibly can to co-operate.
Some Hon. SENATORS: QuestionI
The Hon. the SPEAKER: The question is
on the second reading of this Bill. Is it the
pleasure of honourable members to adopt the
motion?
Some Hon. SENATORS: Carried.
Hon. Mr. SAUVE: On division.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE:
Carried on
division.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was
read the second time.
REFERRED TO COMMITTEE

The Hon. the SPEAKER: When shall this
Bill be read a third time?
Right Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I move,
seconded by Right Hon. Mr. Graham, that this
Bill be referred to the Standing Committee on
Banking and Commerce.
The motion was agreed to.
Right Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I desire
to inform my colleagues that the Committee on
Banking and Commerce will meet to-morrow
morning at 11 o'clock, to examine into the
desirability of some amendments touching
only the form of the Bill.
Let me repeat what I have affirmed so often,
that honourable senators who are not members of the Banking and Commerce Committee
-which is composed of forty-two membersshould attend the meeting, where, except for
the right to vote, they will have all the powers
of committee members in presenting their
views. Do not let my friends who are not
members of the committee hesitate to attend.
I can assure them that the committee will welcome their presence and their opinions.
Hon. Mr. SHARPE: Why not refer the
Bill to Committee of the Whole House and
have done with it? We shall all be here.
I have
Right Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
considered that procedure, but it would be
somewhat difficult to draft technical amendments and discuss their merits if we were not
all around a table. There will be this other
advantage too: probably we shall have before
us the Minister who guided this Bill through
the other House.

DOMINION PLEBISCITE BILL
REPORT OF COMMITTEE

Hon. J. W. de B. FARRIS, Acting Chairman
of the Standing Committee on Banking and
Commerce, presented, and moved concurrence
in, the report of the committee on Bill 10, an
Act respecting the taking of a Plebiscite in
every electoral district in Canada and the
taking of the votes at such Plebiscite of
Canadian Service voters stationed within and
without Canada.
He said: Honourable senators, the Standing
Committee on Banking and Commerce, to
whom this Bill was referred, have instructed
me to state that they have examined the said
Bill and now beg leave to report the same
with certain amendments. I am prepared to
give a short explanation of these amendments
at any time the House wishes.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Dispense.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: I shall do it now if
that is the wish of the House.
There are several amendments, but they do
not in any way change the principle of the
Bill. The first amendment is to section 2,
the definitions section. The two paragraphs,
(a) and (h), which define "Canadian Service
voter" and "ordinary voter," are now conbined without any substantial change. The
provision in paragraph (b) relating to the
"Chief Plebiscite Officer," which now appears
in the definitions, is made a substantive
section. The same is true of paragraph (g),
in relation to "returning officer." The words
"during the plebiscite" in paragraph (c) have
been eliminated, because they do not appear
elsewhere in the Bill. Paragraph (d), in
regard to electoral districts, has been redrawn
so as to state more accurately what is
intended.
The next amendments are to section 3, on
page 2 of the Bill. The words "as defined in
this Act" are dropped out of subsection 4, being
superfluous, and subsection 5 is redrawn to
express in better language what the committee
thought was intended as regards publication
in the Canada Gazette.
I come now to section 4. Paragraph (b)
of subsection 2 has been redrawn in order to
correct an inaccurate citation of the National

68

SENATE

War Services Regulations, which are referred
A simi.lar correction has been
to therein.
made in section 5. From section 6 the words
"taken under this Act" have been eliminated
as superfluous.
Section 8 bas been changed by adding the
two sections of definitions to which I referred.
Subsection 1 would provide:
The Chief Electoral Officer under The
Dominion Elections Act, 1938. shall be the
Chief Plebiscite Officer for the purposes of
this Act. . . .
And subsection 2 would provide:
For the purposes of taking the plebiscite only,
the Governor in Council may appoint a returning officer for the Yellowknife Administrative
District. . . .
That is put in an affirmative statement rather
than being left in the somewhat left-handed
way that it was under the definitions in
section 2. Section 8 itself, as it alppears in
the text, with one or two slight grammatical
modifications, would become subsection 3 of
section 8.
In section 9 there are one or two changes in
language. The original wording is:
The Governor in Council may, for the purposes of this Act, make such regulations as are
expedient for the effectual taking of the
plebiscite. . . .
The words "for the effectual taking of the
plebiscite" are either superfluous or misleading. The powers of the Governor in Council
in making regulations should be for the purposes of the Act. If there is only one purpose,
it is superfluous to add these words; and if
there are more purposes than one, they should
not be limited by these words. The amended
section would read:
The Governor in Council may make such
regulations as are expedient for the purposes of
this Act. . . .
Subsection 4, which has been added to
section 9, specifically gives the Governor in
Council powers to impose penalties. These
powers might have been inferred from the Bill
as it read, but the implication was not clear.
I understand an amendment is to be proposed
to the new subsection 4.
Right Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: It was
proposed in the committee this morning that
section 9 be amended by adding subsection 4,
the last phrase of which would provide:
. . . but no such penalty shall exceed a fine
of two thousand dollars or imprisonment for any
term exceeding two years, or both fine and
imprisomnent.
Our Law Clerk drew my attention to the fact
that it would be advisable to drop the last
phrase of subsection 4 of section 9. In section
9 the Governor in Council is required to make
Hon. Mr. FARRIS.

regulations in conformity with the Dominion
Elections Act of 1938. Section 29 of that Act
provides that persons guilty of the offences
set out therein shall in addition to other
penalties be disqualified from voting for a
term of seven years. In order to preserve that
particular penalty it would be advisable to
delete the latter -part of subsection 4 of section
9 of this Bill, and leave the subsection ending
with the word "indictment" in the fifth line.
If it is agrecable to honourable members, I
will ask the honourable senator from Toronto
(Hon. Mr. Hayden) to propose this amendment now.
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: I move that the
report be amended with respect to subsection
4 of section 9 as indicated by the right honourable leader of the House.
Hon. Mr. COTE: I do not wish to be
technical, but I am wondering whether it is
according to our rules to amend the report
of a committee before a motion bas been made
for its adoption.
lion. Mr. DANDURAND: We can either
amend the report now or move the amendment
on the motion for third reading. I thought
that, as the report dealt with that clause, I
should apprise the Senate of my intention to
have this amendment moved. Though it may
not conform with our practice, I think it would
simplify matters to take action now.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: At the moment
we are considering the motion to adopt the
report. Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the report with all the amendments that have been proposed?
Some Hon. SENATORS: Carried.
The motion was agreed to.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: When shall this
Bill, as amended, be read a third time?
Right Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I would
draw attention to an amendment which was
made in the French text of the question to
be submitted to the electorate. The question
as it came before us in committee this morning was as follows:
Consentez-vous à libérer le Gouvernement de
toute obligation résultant d'engagements antérieurs restreignant les méthodes de recrutement
pour le service militaire?
An honourable senator suggested that the
word "recrutement" be changed to "mobilisation," and the suggestion was accepted. The
question as amended now rends:
Consentez-vous à libérer le Gouvernement de
toute obligation résultant d'engagements antérieurs restreignant les méthodes de mobilisation
pour le service militaire?

MARCH 5, 1942
This amendment is contained in the report.
Since the committee adjourned it bas been
suggested that "enrôlement" would be a better
expression than ".mobilisation," but the mover
of the amendment stands by his decision that
"mobilisation" is a better word than "enrôlement." Since "mobilisation" effects its purpose and inasmuch as we have the Mobilization Act, it is useless to discuss the matter
further.
THIRD READING

Right Hon. Mr. Dandurand moved, seconded
by Right Hon. Mr. Graham, that the Bill, as
amended, be read a third time.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: Honourable
senators, it is moved by Right Hon. Mr.
Dandurand, seconded by the Right Hon. Mr.
Graham, that this Bill, as amended, be now
read a third time. Is it your 'pleasure to
accept the motion?
Right Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Do I
understand that the amendment proposed by
the Hon. Mr. Hayden was accepted?
The Hon. the SPEAKER: I understand so,
with leave of the Senate.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Yes.
Hon. ARTHUR SAUVÉ (Translation):
Honourable senators, I wish to say a few words
on the third reading of this Bill.
Right Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Would you
please speak a little louder so that we may
hear you?
Hon. Mr. SAUVÉ: I will try. I know time
is precious, and I do not want to waste it by
repeating what bas been said a hundred times
in the other House. Still, I wish to say that
I remain opposed to the measure at present
undergoing its third reading.
I am opposed to it because I consider it illadvised, devoid of constitutional authority and
contrary to the fundamental principles of
responsible government. Moreover, the arguments advanced in its favour are, to my mind,
more political pretexts and expedients.
The Government ask to be released by the
people from their past commitments relating
to the war and to participation therein, that
is to say, to be released from their lack of
foresight and, it must be said, their electoral
exploitations.
I am opposed to this measure because the
Government, in proposing it, offer no guarantee
for the future. They refuse to state what they
intend to do should they obtain the freedom
of action they seek. That is why, honourable
senators, this measure seems to me ill-advised.
The Government also refuse to state the real
reason for the plebiscite, thus continuing a

political game that bas already cost the country too much. The plebiscite will cost
$1,500,000-perhaps more before we are
through with it-although the country needs
every cent it can raise to meet its increasingly
heavy obligations.

We are going to spend $1,500,000, though
the war bas already cost us $3,000,000,000 and
will require a still greater expenditure during
the current year, and though the Government,
without consulting Parliament, have made to
England an outright gift of $1,000,000,000 and
a non-interest-bearing loan of $850,000,000.
The Government's methods are, to my mind,
a series of contradictions and violations, from
the moderato participation which they
promised to the extremely costly and badly
organized system of voluntary enlistment,
dangerously administered by too many favourites or obviously incompetent officials.
Of course, this statement is not meant to
include all the officers, all the chairmen of
boards and all the ten-per-cent contractors.
There are notable exceptions.
Before proceeding by way of a plebiscite,
with the unavowed object of establishing conscription, which the party at present in power
bas already shown toibe so odious and revolting, the Government would have been better
advised to institute an inquiry with the sole
object of ascertaining the real needs of Canada
and of the allied nations, the existing and
potential capacity

and requirements

of our

production for the protection of this country
and of the allies, the extent of our military
preparedness and the real needs of our defence.
For it is essential to know our true position,
our strength and also our weakness. We are
reminded of the admiration expressed for our
war effort by authorized representatives of our
allies. These representatives are doubtless
authorized, but are they authorized to make
statements that are not within their province?
Hon. Mr. DAVID: Will the honourable
senator permit a question? I think lie sat in
the Quebec House in 1917. Will lie say how
he voted on the matter of conscription?
Hon. Mr. SAUVÉ I knew beforehand that
the honourable senator was about to interrupt
me without knowing what I was going to say.
Hon. Mr. DAVID: I beg the honourable
gentleman's pardon. He has no right to impugn my fairness in this House. I think I
have always been fairer towards him than he
has been towards me.
Hon. Mr. SAUVÉ: I have been hearing this
profession for twenty-five years. The honourable gentleman lias not changed.
An Hon. SENATOR: However it may be,
lie has not answered your question.

SENATE
Hon. Mr. DAVID: No, he has not answered
my question, and he will not answer it.
Hon. Mr. SAUVÉ: The testimony of people
who have lacked foresight in their own country
should have no value in Canada.
One does not have to look long, honourable
senators, to notice the anomalies, the bluff on
paper, the camouflage, the dangerous inefficiency, the various forms of exploitation, the
glaring injustice, and the scandalous abuses
with regard to the ten per cent. I do not
hold the Ministers altogether responsible, for
I know that they are quite busy; they must
go through reports from the heads of their
departments, who in turn receive reports from
their subordinates. But, honourable senators,
let me add that even there noteworthy exceptions are to be found. Besides, I shall discuss
that muatter atgain during this session.

We are told that the enemy is at our gates.
Wiere are our defenders?
WThat is their
strength? What is their efficiency? That is
what we ought to know dcfinitely. The danger
which threatens us can be appraised through
tihe unfortunate examples given us by England,
France, the United States and hapless Australia.
Hon. Mr. DAVID: I do not wish to
interrupt the honourable senator needlessly,
but in 1911, when the creation of a Canadian
navy was proposed, was he in favour of a
Canadian navy?
Hon. Mr. SAUVE: I hope that during this
session it will be in order for tie honourable
senator to deliver a fotnnal speech on the
political affairs of that period, for I shall then
be able to have a better recollection of what
passed on both sides.

Hon. Mr. DAVID: At this time, that is past
history.
Hon. Mr. SAUVE: At this time, the honourable senator is not more willing than J am to
discuss a matter whieh is now out of order.
Hon. Mr. DAVID: I beg your pardon; I
am quite willing to do so right now.
Hon. Mr. SAUVE: Well, that will be all
for to-day. The danger wbich threatens us
,an bo appraised through the unfortunate
3xanples given us by the countries I have
mentioned. We should not wait until disaster
has overtaken us to hold an inquiry that
should have been held long ago. Such an
inquiry should be conducted not by partisans
or creatures of the Government, but by free
and competent men, able to set aside party
considerations or personal interest, by men
able to tell lie truth to those who ought to
know it, not to one party only, but to the
representatives of the nation, in the Parliament of the nation.
Hon. Mr. SAUVÉ.

I realize how difficult it will be to obtain
such an inquiry so long as we have a strictly
party Government, determined to select their
memebers solely among their own followers,
instead of a truly national government, a
government composed of men who are not
politicians, a government truly representing
the nation, to ensure national unity in a logical
way.
Is it not proper that we should realize
this if we wisi to avoid the grave political
crisis, the signs of which are more apparent
every day? If we demand a national government, it should not be in order to sacrifice
our own country by a rash or excessively
impulsive ovetseas contribution, but rather
to better protect our Dominion and our allies,
to better utilize our resources for war and
post-war purposes. If a national government
is necessary to undertake this essential study
without delay, let us do our duty without hesitation; let us not wait until it is too late.
Conscription should not be an issue until
after a study of that nature has been competently conducted.
When conscription is proposed, I wish to be
free to set out the loval, honest and logical
stand of the province of Quebec. We are
bcing logical in opposing conscription for overseas; we are onv following the political teaching and guidance of both political parties,
whose leaders w-ere and still are Englishspeaking.
We are convinced that, in the
jresent conflict, the Canadian war effort, to
be the most efficient for our allies, must be
accomplisbed within our borders. We want
to know whether this is right. We would
submit to the findings of an inquiring body
com.posed of competent Canadians. It is not
through hatred, prejudice or egotism that we
oppose conscription for overseas; we are
becoming more and more opposed to this
measure because the efficiency of our own
territorial defence becomes more doubtful
every day, because the peril ever increases, as
our best authorized military men have
acknowledged. In perusing their statements
we should not forget their implied meaning
nor tie limitations imposed by the high position of these officers.
My opposition to this Bill is based on no
other reasons. I am opposed to it in the
best possible spirit and my past conduct stands
witness to this fact, althougi that is, it would
seeme, of such little importance that certain
men who consider themselves as very outstanding appear to have forgotten all about it.
Riglht Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Would
tie honourable senator allow me to ask a
question?
Hon. Mr. SAUVE: Certainly.

MARCH 5,1942
Right Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The main
idea expressed by the honourable senator is

production capacity, our assets, our own
nature.

Hon. Mr. DAVID: Everything told, it
would be a study conducted by Conservatives.
Right Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: However,
unless I am mistaken, a national government is one from which politicians would be
excluded.
Hon. Mr. SAUVE: Not at all. It would
not necessarily include politicians only, if
competent men could be found in other fields.
I am convinced that such a study, to be
complete and impartial and to represent all the
nation, in these difficult times, should be
undertaken under a national government,
for in this way only would national unity
be logically and really preserved.
Has the
Right Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
honourable senator thought of submitting a list
of men who would represent his ideal of this
national government?
Hon. Mr. SAUVE: The honourable leader
knows perfectly well that the naming of these
men is not my responsibility. Possibly he
wishes to take the place of my friend from
Sorel in asking awkward questions, but he may
rest assured that I shall not fall into the trap.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill, as
amended, was read the third time, and passed.

The Hon. the SPEAKER informed the

With

should like te inquire of the right honourable
leader of the House (Right Hon. Mr.
Dandurand) whether it is his intention te
make any statement te the Senate in reference te the very disturbing reports that are
coming from Hong Kong. I should suppose
that we in this country are much interested,
having about seve.nteen hundred men over
there, survivors of two regiments, one from
the province of Quebec and the other from the
province of Manitoba.
I observe that to-day, in the Imperial House
of Commons, Mr. Eden, Secretary of State
for Foreign Affairs, made a very strong statenient in rrspcet of what he says are the shocking atrocities committed by Japanese soldiers
against. British prisoners of war and the civil
population. I presume a similar statement
was made in the House of Lords. I should
think that this Senate is entitled te receive
information from the Government of Canada,
se that we and flic country may know what
is and what is net truc in respect of these
very disturbing reports. I take it for granted
fhat the Government has all the information
on which Mr. Eden based his state ment, and
I suggest that this is no tinie to be silent or
to shut our eyes te facts which may not be
pleasing. We should know with certainty what
is happening, especially having in mind that,
as I said a moment ago, we have about
seventeen hundred Canadian soldiers where
these atrocities are being committed. I submit to my riglt honourable friend that lie is
the man to give us the facts. There can be
no secrecy about the matter, for Mr. Eden
announced that the facts which he gave te the
House of Commons-I nay say tliat I heard
only a brief radio report of his address-were
to be put into every language and sent all
over the world, so that the world would know
the kind of savages these Japanese are. We
have twenty-five thousand or more Japanese
people in this country, and we have been
treating them as if they were the most gentle
and well-behaved people in the world. Now,
we want te know what is happening to the
Canadiîrs over in Hong Kong, and I ask
my riglht honourable friend to tell us. He
may not be able to tIo it to-night, but
to-norrow at the latest he should give us a
clear statenent of the facts of the matter.

Hon. JOHN T. HAIG: Honourable members, a statement was given in the House of

diffidence to speak on this subject, but the
city of Winnipeg, from which I come, is very
deeply concerned in it.
There are more
Canadians from the city of Winnipeg who
are prisoners in Kowloon than there are from
any other part of this country. Therefore
the people of Winnipeg are vitally interested,
and they feel very keenly the absence of
news. I must express my surprise that we
have not had a statement to-night.
Right Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I reached
Ottawa only this evening. A note bas just
been brought to me informing me that the

Agreements entered into with Chile, Brazil
and the Argentine Republic, and to ask the
Senate to concur in the said approval.
Right Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND: Honourable senators, one of the resolutions which
are to come before us reads as follows:
That it is expedient that the Senate and the
House of Commons do approve the Trade Agreement between Canada and Chile, signed September 10, 1941, and that the Senate do approve
the same.

73

There are three such resolutions, the other
two concerning Brazil and the Argentine
Republic. I would suggest that all three be
dealt with at the same time, because they are
all in virtually the same form. If there is
no objection to that course, I shall be ready
to give whatever information is desired on
any of them by any honourable member of
this House.
The first trade agreement, namely that between Canada and Chile, was signed in Chile
on September 10, 1941, and bas been provisionally in force since October 15, 1941. The
agreement between Canada and the Argentine
Republic was signed at Buenos Aires on
October 2, 1941, and bas been provisionally
in force since November 15 last. The third
agreement, that between Canada and Brazil,
was signed at Rio de Janeiro on October 17,
1941, and bas been in force provisionally
since that date.
While these trade agreements have been in
force provisionally since the dates I have just
mentioned, the continuance of their operation requires the approval of both Houses
of Parliament by joint resolution, and subsequent ratification by the Seeretary of State
for External Affairs. Such is the position
with respect to Canada, and a similar requirement would apply in corresponding manner te
each of the administrations in the other
countries concerned.
The first question which may arise in the
minds of some honourable members of this
House is as to how it has come about that
an agreement has been signed and is even
provisionally in operation without Parliament
having had an opportunity of passing upon
it in the first instance. It would be impracticable for publie assemblies to discuss agreements between nations before they are actually
signed. Honourable members will appreciate
the many questions which arise in connection
with the negotiation of any agreement.
Negotiations are of necessity carried on among
persons appointed for that purpose.
The
present stage of proceedings, therefore, is one
wherein we seek to secure approval of the
three trade agreements as negotiated.
The agreements themselves are all agreements affording most-favoured-nation reciprocal treatment between the countries which
have entered into them. They are similar to
other agreements of the most-favoured-nation
type which have been entered inte in recent
Four such agreements lhave been

signed recently. One between Canada and
Uruguay was approved in the session of 1937;
one between Canada and Gautemala was
approved in the session of 1938; one with

SENATE

Haiti received approval in the 1938 session,
and an agreement with the Dominican
Republie was approved in the session of 1940.
I believe that in the case of the first three
agreements our Parliament proceeded by way
However, with respect to the
of bills.
Dominican Republic agreement, the procedure
was simply by way of resolution approving
the agreement. The reason that no bill is
required is that no statute is being amended
in any way. All the agreement dues is to
provide for most-favoured-nation treatment
to be given by one country te the other, and
to ensure that the most-favoured attitude will
be reciprocated by the other country. If the
agreement did in any way change a statuto,
it would of course be necessary to proceed
by way of a bill. However, liaving regard to
the forni of these agreements, and to their
contents, approval by resolution is all that is
necessary.
In the case of the three republics with which
agreements with Canada have been entered
into, a definite step forward has been taken in
securing the advantages of improved trade
relations. At this timoe of war the actual
value in ternis of trade may net be considerable, but there is great value in the fact
that the treaties themselves serve to express
friendship and goodwiE between these particular republics in another part of the
western hemisplhere and the Dominion of
Canada.
The Minister of Trade and Commerce has
received word from our Ministers in the
Argentine and Brazil since the establishment
of our legations in South America that the trade
mission which visited those countries has been
greatly appreciated by the citizens. They felt
that the mission itself had done a great deal
to make Canada and its resources better
known, had brought our country more to the
fore than it had been at any time in the past.
I might add that I have been told the same
thing by the Hon. Doctor Pablo Santos
Munoz, Minister of the Argentine Republic,
and the Hon. J. A. Lius de Barres, Minister for
Brazil, whiom we are pleased to have at
of these
Ottawa as the representatives
countries.
Honourable members will have noticed that
the name of the Argentine Republic bas come
before us recently in reference to the protection which that country is giving to
Canada's interest in Japan at the present
time. I mention this as indicative of the
closer relations and co-operation which our
country in the last year bas come to enjoy
with South America.
To-day, when conditions have become so
much more serious in all parts of the world
Right Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

and when North and South America have
been drawn together to a degree that bas never
obtained heretofore, it is particularly fortunate that we should have established
diplomatic relations with these countries
through the legations which they have opened
in Ottawa and which we have opened in
Brazil, the Argentine and Chile. It is also
fortunate that we should have established
with these countries at this time of war the
foundations for coser trade relations in the
post-war era. Whcn the war is over the way
will already have been paved for the immediate developmcnt of trade on as large a scale
as may be possible. This service will be due
in no smnail measure to the trade mission
whiclh the Minister of Trade and Commerce
headed last fall. This Chamber will, I feel
sure, permit me to extend to him the congratulations of honourable senators upon the
success of the mission and lis leadership of it.
I desire to complete this general statement
by reading seme excerpts from the very valuable information given te the other House by
the Minister of Trade and Commerce, who
negotiated these treaties. I will limit my
review of that information to commercial
features, but I would suggest that honourable
menibers who have net read the whole discussion would be well advised to do so. They
will find it in the House of Commons Debates
of February 27. It net only deals with the
situation in those countries and gives figures
as to their various productions, but also refers
to the exceptional development that as taken
place in South Anerica.
The Minister says:
The success of our trade imission ewas unique,
inasmuch as we accoiplished our objective in
each country visited.
He pays tribute to the personnel of the
party and mentions as one of the principal
negotiators the Deputy Minister of Trade and
Commerce, Mr. Wilgress, whose experience in
matters of external trade is well known to
every honourable senator. Another member
of the party was Mr. Yves Lamontagne,
Director of Commercial Relations in the
Departient of Trade and Commerce, who, the
Minister saya, was of great strength to the
mission, "and his inclusion in it, with his
bilingualism, made a definite appeal wherever
we went." Then the Minister goes on:
Mr. Escott Reid, of the Departient of
External Affairs, not only ably represented that
department in familiarizing hinmself with couditions in the varions conntries visited, but
by his tact and courtesy made a definite contribution. The very important and exacting
iwork of secretary of the mission was nost
capably handled by Mr. A. C. L. Adans.

MARCH 10, 1942
The objective of the mission was not immediate results, although we hoped to get and
are getting these, but rather the laying of the
best possible foundations upon which after-thewar trade can be effectively built.
Countries visited included Ecuador, Peru,
Chile, Argentina, Uruguay and Brazil, all
south of the equator.
The mission's visit had several aims. The
general objective was exploratory. We desired
to investigate opportunities for the development
of reciprocal trade between Canada and the
countries visited and, when and where possible,
remove obstacles which hindered progress in
commercial relations. Powers were conferred
upon me by the Governor in Council enabling
me to conclude most-favoured-nation trade agreements, thereby removing or preventing diserimination against Canadian products in
respect to tariff matters and exchange control.
An important aspect of the visit was the
furtherance of goodwill.
The mission found
during its tour that in all the countries visited
there was the highest regard for Canada and a
general desire to strengthen trade relations.
The mission was received with the utmost
courtesy on its arrival in each country. We
were accorded the greatest hospitality and every
possible facility was extended to us.
In each country visited the Press devoted
very considerable space to the activities of the
mission and stressed the character and importance of the visit.
We first visited the countries on the Pacifie
coast, Ecuador, Peru and Chile, in the order
given.
Up to the time of our visit Canada possessed
no trade agreements with these countries. A
feature of Canada's trade common tu all three
countries is the fact that over the last decade
their balance of trade has been favourable to
Canada. The favourable balance for 1940 with
the three countries was $2,181,000, and for 1941,
$654,000.
Compared with Canada's trade with the world,
our trade with the countries on the western
coast of South America is small, but the figures
assume greater significance to them because their
export and import trade is on a considerably
smaller scale than ours.
Trade is an exchange of goods, a two-way
process, and if we are to continue to sell our
products abroad we must be ready to reciprocate. To the extent at least that we can
increase our purchases from all the Latin-

American countries, we shall make it possible
for them te increase their purchases from
Canada.
It is interesting te note that while the balance of trade between Canada and Argentina
and Brazil was favourable te Canada in 1938,
it became favourable te these two countries in
1940. The volume of trade in both directions
bas in fact expanded, which is a satisfactory
In 1941 Brazil increased its
development.
favourable balance, but the balance became
favourable te Canada in regard te Argentina.
With respect te Uruguay, we find that taking
1939 and 1940 together, our exports te and imports from that country are about balanced,
whereas in years prier to 1939 the balance of
trade bas been in Canada's favour. In 1941 the
balance was again substantially favourable te
this country.
The six countries of South America visited
by the mission are inhabited by 75 million
people. Brazil bas about 45 million inhabitants,
Argentina about 13 million, and Chile a population of 5 million. The total population of this

group of countries, therefore, is 63 millions, or
approximately 84 per cent of the total popula-

tion of the six countries visited.
The total imports of these six countries
amounted to an aggregate value of $956,800,000
in United States dollars in 1938, Argentina,
Brazil and Chile together accounting for 88 per
cent of this total (United States, $838,500,000).
This gives an idea of the purchasing power
available in these three countries alone.
The aggregate experts of these six countries
were approximately $1,020,000,000 in United
States dollars in 1938, the share of Argentina,
Brazil and Chile being 86 per cent of this total
(United States, $872,400,000).
In 1938 Canada's experts te the six countries
totalled $9,961,000 (in each case United States
dollars), of which $8.801,000 or 87 per cent were
consigned to Argentina, Brazil and Chile. In
1940 our total exports te the six countries
amounted to $14,874,000, of which Canadian
experts te Argentina, were $6.107,000, te Brazil
$5,063,000 and te Chile $1,436.000, or 85 per cent
of the total. In 1941 the total was $20,092,000
te Argentina, $8,097.000 te Brazil
-$7,172,000
and $1,788.000 to Chile, these three countries
again taking 85 per cent of the total.
Canada's total imports from the six countries
in 1940 amounted te $14,129,000 ($12,960,000 or
92 per cent from Argentina. Brazil and Chile).
and in 1941 the total was $28.134,000, of which
87 per cent came froin these three countries.
As a matter of reference, I should like te
put these figures on Hansard in tabular form:

Previous to our visit Canada had no direct
trade treaty with Chile.
In 1931 Chile and the United Kingdom
concluded a trade arrangement on the basis of
most-favoured-nation
treatment, and in the
past certain countries had been granted special
concessions by Chile in trade agreements, but
these advantages had not been extended to
Canada.
Negotiations between Canada and Chile had
been undertaken early in 1936 on the basis of
most-favoured-nation
treatment,
but
little
orogress was made, one of the main reasons
being that the balance of trade between the
two countries was unfavourable
te Clile.
Another problem was the granting of foreign
exchange by Chile for the purchasing of
Canadian goods. Chile, ho-wever, ivas anxious
to obtain the advantages of the Canadian intermediate tariff as regards one of its most
important exports-nitrates.
A trade agreement between Canada and
Chile was signed at Santiago on September
10, 1941.
Based upon mutual concession of
most-favoured-nation
treatment
in
matters
pertaining te tariffs, import quotas and foreign
exchange control, the treaty providesI do not know whether the particulars are of
interest to honourable members, but I will give
then for Chile, taking it for granted that they
cover similar ground in the other treaties. I
mention them also for the benefit of honour-

able senators who have had something to do
Right Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

with negotiating trade treaties. These matters
appear as difficulties to be met and solved in

every trade treaty negotiated by Canada. The
treaty provides:
(a) For the extension to Chile of the benefits
granted under Canada's intermediate tariff as
regards imports into Canada from that country.
In return, Canadian goods exported to Chile
enjoy the rates of duty under the minimum
tariff.
(b) On the basis of nost-favoured-nation
treatient, Canada enjoys the benefits of any
reductions which may be granted to other
countries by Chile, and, conversely, Chile is
granted any reductions under the intermediate
tariff which Canada may grant as a result
of tarifï negotiations with othler countries or
etherwise.
(c) The tariff advantages which Canada may
grant to imports from Empire countries are
excluded under the provisions of the agreements, as well as the treatment which Chile
iay
reserve
to imports
from contiguous
countries.

Where governments have established monopwhich affect the production, sale or
olies
importation of certain products, provision is
made for fair and non-discriminatory treatment by the respective signatories of the trade
agreement.
The agreement also provides against discrimination with respect to internal taxes and

charges on imports.

MARCH 10, 1942
Provision is made for consultation between
Canada and Chile on the various matters
covered by the agreement so that mutually
satisfactory adjustments may be effected when
measures are taken which may impair any
of the objects of the agreement.
Exemption from the provisions of the agreement is made with respect to measures relating
to public security, the enforcement of police
or revenue laws and regulations, and the
measures affecting imports and exports of gold
and silver, and of war materials.
Special advantages granted to adjacent countries in order to facilitate frontier traffic and
any advantages accorded to a third country
resulting from a customs union are also
exempted from the provisions of the agreement.
The agreement is for a period of two years.
I am outlining the agreement with Chile
in detail as the agreements signed with
Argentina and Brazil are practically identical,
except that in the agreement with Argentina
the special situation existing between that
country and Peru as regards matters pertaining to foreign exchange is recognized. This
agreement also recognizes the situation which
exists as regards the conditions which govern
trade between Argentina and the United
Kingdom at the present time, although this
matter is not referred to in the text of the
agreement.
In brief Canada and Chile extend to each
other most-favoured-nation treatment as regards
tariff and all matters relating to control of
foreign exchange and imports, with certain
derogations relating to advantages granted by
Canada to the British Empire on the one hand
and, on the other, by Chile to its contiguous
countries.
The agreement also provides that products
of Canada and Chile imported into the other
country are not to be subject, with certain
specified exceptions, to internal taxes, fees,
charges or exactions higher than those payable
on like articles of national origin or any other
foreign origin.
Provision is also made that nitrate of soda
and iodine, two important natural products of
Chile, shall not be subject on importation into
Canada to any form of quantitative control of
imports less favourable, nor to duties or charges
higher than, like products, natural or synthetic,
originating in any other foreign country.
The trade agreement provides that it is to
come into force thirty days after exchange of
ratifications, and provides that it is to remain
in force for two years.
Advantages to Canada. By assuring reciprocal
most-favoured-nation treatment in respect to
tariffs and exchange control, the trade agreeCanada and Chile
ment signed between
guarantees Canadian exports against discrimination in the event that Chile should conclude
agreements with other countries providing for
reductions below Chile's minimum tariff.
There are in force in Chile some conventional
rates of duty, lower than the normal tariff,
which will be accorded to imports from Canada
under the agreement. These arise mainly from
a trade agreement between Chile and France
signed January 16, 1936. Among the products
to which these reduced duties apply are preserved meats and vegetables, certain cotton yarn
and cloth, medicinal preparations, gloves and
certain other leather manufactures, wool and
silk clothing, certain chemicals, structural iron
and steel, toilet preparations, wallpaper and
some other paper manufactures.

Advantages to Chile. The trade agreement
assures Chile of the benefits accruing from
Canada's intermediate tariff and removes the
3 per cent special excise tax on the duty paid
value of imports when such imports are dutiable
under Canada's general tariff. Canada's imports
from Chile have consisted mostly of sodium
nitrate, manila fibre, field seed and fresh
onions, manganese oxide and undressed furs.
The principal commodities which Canada exports to Chile are: newsprint, rubber tires,
farm implements, asbestos, rubber, boots and
shoes, electrie apparatus, iron pipes and fittings,
rubber belting, wood pulp, soda and sodium
compounds. Sawn lumber bas recently been
added to this list. Among the minor items are
herrings, dry-salted; whiskey; canvas shoes with
rubber soles; artificial silk manufactures;
veneers and plywood; wallpaper; needles;
hardware; storage batteries; telephone and
telegraph apparatus; medicinal preparations
and brushes.
I see a note here that may be of interest.
We have instituted an intensive study of
what additional purchases can be made from
Chile, for an unbalanced trade can not be
continued with satisfactory results indefinitely.
With European wine supplies eut off indefinitely
there might be a market in Canada for the
excellent Chilean wines which are held in high
favour wherever used.
Then I come to Argentina, and the advantages that we hope to derive from the agreement with that country, and, those which
that country may expect under the agreement.
ln order not to tire the Senate with the
details, I would ask leave to place them on
Hansard without reading them.
The trade agreement with Argentina is the
first direct arrangement concluded between the
two countries, and in many respects it is a
most important agreement. It places our trade
relations with Argentina on a secure basis.
Up till November 15 last, Canada's trade
with Argentina had been regulated under the
provisions of a Treaty of Amity, Commerce and
Navigation signed by Argentina and Great
Britain in 1825, or 42 years before Confederation. This treaty placed trade between Argentina and the British Empire on a reciprocal
most-favoured-nation
basis, but there had
arisen doubts as to the rights which Canada
enjoyed under the treaty. There was uncertainty, for instance, that Canada would be
assured of the benefits of the reductions in rates
of duty which Argentina was to grant the
United States as a result of the trade negotiations which had just been carried on between
Argentina and the United States. These were
nearing conclusion when the Canadian trade
mission arrived in Argentina. There were also
uncertainties resulting from Argentina's foreign
exchange control system.
As a result of the new trade agreement, the
situation as regards foreign exchange control
has been clarified. The agreement came into
effect provisionally on November 15, and is to
come definitely into force thirty days after the
exchange of ratifications. It is to remain in
force for a period of two years, and thereafter
until termination by either government.

78

SENATE

As Argentina was already enjoying the advantages of the intermediate tariff of Canada,
it was not necessary to pass an Order in Council
to implement the agreement.
The trade agreement contains an article
(Article II) dealing with foreign excbange control which recognizes the special situation
whereby the trade between Argentina and the
United Kingdom is regulated under a payments
agreement.
Argentina agrees to grant Canada treatment
not less favourable than it accords to other
countries in natters l)ertaining to the rates
and the allocation of foreign exchange which
Argentina makes available for commercial
transactions, excluding, however, the special
advantages which Argentina extends to imports
from countries contiguous to Argentina, and
to Peru.
This means that Canada is assured of as
favourable treatment in the granting of exchange
as that whicli Argentina may accord to the
United States and other countries not excepted
under the provisions of Article II.
It may be added that the United States,
under a treaty signed with Argentina on
October 14 last, also made substantially the
same reservations that are provided for under
Canada's trade agreement with Argentina.
Under the new agreement, Canadian exporters are assured against discrimination during
the life-time of the agreement.
Canada will also enjoy, under the nostfavoured-nation clause, the benefits of certain
reduction in duties granted by Argentina to
the United States under a treaty between the
two countries which was signed at Buenos
Aires on October 14, and which was applied
provisionally on November 15 last, w'hich by
coincidence, is also the date on which our
agreement with Argentina also, provisionally,
came into force.

Canada's total trade with Argentina during
1932 and 1933, at the bottom of the world
economie depression, averaged $4,096,000 yearly.
In 1941 the value of the total trade between the
two countries amounted to $11,935,856, imports
from Argentine being $2,408,000 less than Canadian exports to that country. Statistics for the

Right Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

(Note.-Imports from Argentina reached a
high level in 1936 because of large imports of
maize.)
Canada's main exports to Argentina in recent
years have been newsprint, farm implements,
seed potatoes, electric apparatus. Other exports
include apples, lumber, asbestos, calcium carbide, manufactures of iron and steel, wrapping
paper, woodpulp, wallboards, fox skins, paints,
dried cod and other fish products.
Canada's chief imports from Argentina are:
hides and skins, flax seed, maize, canned beef,
quebracho (tanning extract), raw wool, horse
hair, casein and glycerine for refining.
Under the new trade agreement, Argentina
is assured of continuation of most-favourednation treatinent, whereby goods imported into
Canada from Argentina are subject to the rates
under Canada's intermediate tariff, and te the
benefit of reductions which may be granted to
other countries.
Canada concluded
a most-favoured-nation
trade agreement with Uruguay in 1936.
The
provisions of this treaty, however, had not
been fully implemented, as certain difficulties
had arisen regarding the granting of foreign
exchange for the payment of imports of Canadian goods into Uruguay.
The discussions, therefore, had as their
objective the removal of the difficulties which
existed.
A very satisfactory understanding
with the Government of Uruguay was arrived
at, which was embodied in a signed memorandum.
The effect of this agreement should
be reflected by an increase in our exports to
Uruguay, our trade in seed-potatoes and agricultural implements standing to benefit most.
Uruguay is a imost progressive republie and
Montevideo a most beautiful city of over
800,000 people.
Its people are very prodemocratic.
We spent four days in al] in
Uruguay, returning to Buenos Aires before
leaving for Brazil.
On October 6 we landed in Brazil, at Santos,
the port for the tremendously rich Sao Paulo
province, travelling the fifty miles from Santos
to Sao Paulo city by a railway which carries
trains up from the coast valley by a series of
cables, some 2,500 feet in ten miles. The city
of Sao Paulo is one of the most rapidly growing
cities, I believe, of the western hemisphere.
The city bas a population of one million and a
quarter and is fully moder and well planned.
While the Canadian trade mission was in
Brazil we were at all times the guests of the
Government. We were in Rio ten days.
Canadian exports to Brazil are thus assured
against discrimination in respect to tariffs and
exchange control.
The Brazilian tariff consists mainly of a
minimum tariff and a general tariff under
which the rates are approximàtely one-quarter
higher than the minimum tariff. Some rates,
lower than the minimum, granted to the
United States under an agreement with Brazil
in February, 1935, are also extended to imports
from countries enjoying most-favoured-nation
treatment.
Prior to the war, Brazil was second to
Argentina among the Latin-American markets
for Canadian products, but an increase in
Canada's exports to Brazil since 1938 made
Brazil our most important Latin-American customer in 1941.
Concurrently with an increase
in Canadian exports to Brazil since the war

MARCH 10, 1942
began, there has been a substantial rise in
Canadian imports from that country, mainly
due to our purchases of Brazilian cotton.
Canada's total trade with Brazil since 1932
is shown in the following table:

Canada's most important exports to Brazil
in recent years have included sewing machines,
newsprint, lead in pigs, wood pulp, dressed
furs, asbestos, malt, manufactures of felt,
upper leather, iron pipes and fittings, rubber
tires, rubber belting, electrical apparatus, farm
implements, machinery, apples and dried fish.
Among the items of lesser importance the
following may be mentioned: whisky, rubber
goods, textile products, wall-board, hardware,
lamps and lanterns, abrasives, fertilizers, mineral pigments, paints and calcium carbide.
Brazil's main exports to Canada include
cotton, cotton seed oil, coffee, rice, iron ore,
castor oil, and cattle hides. Under the agreement, Brazil enjoys the benefits of the Canadian intermediate tariff and any reductions in
rates which may be granted under the tariff to
other countries.
The officials of Brazilian Traction, both at
Rio and at Sao Paulo, arranged that we inspect
their huge projects at these points, and at all
times during our Brazilian stay the officers of
these great Canadian developments did everything to make our visit interesting and profitable. Time does not permit of an extended
account of the kindnesses and hospitality extended to the Canadian mission in this entraneingly beautiful and interesting city of Rio de
Janeiro and at Therezopolis and Petropolis.
Canada's new Minister to Brazil had arrived
shortly before us and the result of this was that
we participated in the great reception that
Brazil extended to Mr. Desy. Brazil has welcomed Mr. Desy with open arms, and Canada
is very happily represented in this great country
larger in extent than the United States. Our
Minister to the Argentine and Chile, the Honourable Mr. Justice Turgeon, passed us on his
way to these countries while we were leaving
Brazil.
The Latin-American countries are among the
few markets which have remained open to us
since the outbreak of the war in Europe over
two years ago. They constitute markets which
we did not cultivate sufficiently before the war.
Our trade statistics show that we can, and
have been able to increase Canadian exports to
Latin America. In 1938 the value of our aggregate exports to the 20 Latin-American republics
totalled $17,739,000. In 1940 these exports had
risen to $26,190,000 in value, au increase of
approximately 50 per cent. For the first ten
months of 1941 the value of our total exports to
the Latin-American republics exceeded by about

79

$850,000 our exports during the twelve months
of 1940, so that the figures for the twelve monthe
of 1941 will show a considerable increase over
1940.
The three trade agreements signed in the
course of the mission's tour in South America,
the modus vivendi concluded with Ecuador, the
arrangement effected with Uruguay as regards
foreign exchange, the goodwill created and the
publicity accorded to Canada in these countries
and in Peru as a result of the tour constitute,
we believe, very modestly, much progress in the
right direction. These trade agreements were
concluded with a view to improving reciprocal
trade relations between Canada and the countries concerned, and the necessity of that trýade
being reasonably reciprocal must be borne in
mind by our importers and exporters and by
Canadians generally.
With this information, I will move the
adoption of these resolutions. If there are
any questions that any honourable member
of this House desires to put to me concerning
Argentina or Brazil, I shall take pleasure in
endeavouring to answer them, but I feel
confident that the answers will be found in
the statement, which will appear on Hansard.
Hon. C. MacARTHUR: Honourable senators, I am wondering why such an important
matter as this was not considered in committee in the other House, or why that House
did not have some details of the concessions
granted. Usually when you make concessions
there is a quid pro quo, and we ought to
know whether we are gaining or losing. It
seems that the Minister of Trade and Commerce is handling this matter entirely on his
own, and, as there are several other countries
in South America, they no doubt will be coming along with other agreements. Boiling
down all the verbosity we have had, what
does it amount to? What is it we have given
to these countries, and what are we getting?
So far as I am able to see, in all this long discourse there is no mention of the articles
manufactured in those countries, what their
industries are, or what we are getting from
them or are giving to them. I think matters
of this kind should be considered in committee in the other place, and that we should
have upon Hansard some definite information
as to what items of the manufacture of these
countries are being exported to us, and what
we, in return, are exporting to them. In short,
I should like to know how this ail works out.
It may be favourable or it may not. I have
every confidence in the ability of the Minister
of Trade and Commerce to make a good
bargain; but in order to make a bargain
there have to be concessions. There must be
give and take.
What bothers me is why this matter should
come to us in this form. It seems to me we
should have some idea of the articles on which

SENATE
these countries are making concessions and the
articles on which we are asked to make concessions, so that we might strike a balance and
see how we stand. The right honourable
leader referred to our trade with several countries in South America that are not mentioned
in the three agreements. That does not come
into this matter. What we have te deal with
are the agreements with these three countries.
We should be told something of what their
imports have been and what ours have been,
and then we should try to strike a balance between what we are giving to thern and what
they are giving to us. I am positive that another resolution will be introduced in the House
of Commons with regard to several countries
in South America, and I cannot understand
why the Minister of Trade and Commerce did
not make a job of it at one time, instead of
doing the thing piecemeal like this. We talk
about reciprocity with the United States, and
it is still a live question whether we are gaining or losing under our arrangements with that
country. It is just as important to know how
we are to come out under these agreements
with the South American countries. We desire
to be friendly, of course. We do not want to
bicker about a few dollars, but we should know
whether or not we are on the right side of the
books.
Hon. J. A. CALDER: Honourable senators,
by these resolutions this Chamber is asked
to approve three treaties. We have had a
very lengthy and, in many ways, interesting
statement from the right honourable gentleman who leads the House (Right Hon. Mr.
Dandurand), but I feel certain that the
majority of honourable members present
at this time. at any rate those who are
interested, would like to have an opportunity of at least peeping at the treaties. I
have not yet seen one of them. I do not
know whether they have been distributed.
Nevertheless, we are asked by these resolutions
to approve them. It seems to me we should
take a little time about this. Personally, I
thoroughly approve of the idea of mostfavoured-nation tariffs, or whatever they are
called. There are tariffs that we have with
nations that make reciprocal arrangements: I
an net acquainted with the technical terrms
that are used with regard to them. As I say, I
thoroughly approve of the idea. It is a very
desirable thing; there is no question about
that. In the past this House has approved
a goodly number of treaties of the character
of the ones now before us. But as to these,
all the information we have had is what has
been given us hy the right honourable leader
to-night. While he was speaking there was a
good deal of whispering going on around me,
Hon. Mr. MacARTHUR.

and a good deal on the other side of the
House; so I very much doubt if we have taken
in all the information and understood what it
all means.
I am convinced that honourable members of
this House would like to know a little more
definitely just what they are being asked to
approve. I think it is desirable that we should
let this matter stand over until at least tomorrow, and in the meantime it would be an
advantage if we could get a copy of these
treaities, so that we might look thern squarely
in the face and see just what they are. Then
we should be in a better position to justify
any vote we might give.
There is no question at all in my mind
that from now on Canada will have to do all
she can to improve her trading relations
throughout the world. We all now have a
fairly good picture of tLe conditions that exist
in what was to a very large extent a good
market for us, a vast territory on another
continent, probably on two other continents,
that has been completely overrun and left in
a terribly disorganized condition, in so far
as purchasing power is concerned. That is
the situation we have to face, and it seems
to me the more attention we can give to a
continent like South America, where such
conditions do not exist, the better for Canada.
I feel quite sure that the Government has
proceeded along well defined lines that have
been followed in the past, and that everything in the treaties is reasonably sound.
Nevertheless, -I believe it would be wise to
allow the resolutions to stand over long
enough to give honourable members who may
be interested an opportunity to look over
these documents.
Right Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I desire
to state that these agreements were laid on
the Table in November last, but were not
printed nor distributed. I would suggest to
my honourable friend that we might refer
these resolutions to the Committee on Banking and Commerce.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: I agree.
Righit Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: We could
have the Minister and Mr. Wilgress, the
Deputy Minister, appear before the committee
and tell us whaýt these agreements would mean
for Canada. If that is satisfactory to honourable members, I shall gladly arrange to have
these gentlemen present. I should like to
remind the House that all senators, including
those who are not members of the committee,
are free to attend its meetings, ask questions
and join in the discussion. All non-members
who avail themselves of this opportunity will
receive the same first-hand information as

MARCH 10, 1942
senators who actually are on the committee.
If it is agreeable, instead of moving that the
resolutions be adopted n.ow, I will move that
they be referred to the Committee on Banking and Commerce.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: When I rose I had
intended to move that the resolutions be
referred to the Committee on Banking and
Commerce, but I forgot to do so. I think
the proper procedure is to deal with this
matter before that committee. As stated by
the honourable senator from Prince (Hon.
Mr. MacArthur), what this House will want
to know, as exactly as possible, is what we
are giving to each of these nations and what
they are giving to us. What priviileges are
we granting to Chili, Argentina and Brazil?
On the other hand, what advantages do we
get from them? That is the meat of the
question. It should not take very long to
get that information in the Banking and
Commerce Committee.
Hon. C. P. BEAUBIEN: 'I thank the right
honourable gentleman for the suggestion he has
made. May I point out that the treaties themselves probably contain very little; usually they
have only three or four clauses. We cannot
judge the merits of these trade agreements
unless we have a detailed 'list of imports and
exports. By these trade agreements we are
to give to Chile, Brazil and the Argentine
Republic the best possible tariff treatment
apart from what is accorded to Great Britain.
Is it dangerous for us to do that? Since the
Minister of Trade and Commerce recommends approval of these trade agreements, I
assume there is no danger in our taking this
course. But the Argentine produces a tremendous quantity of beef.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: And wheat.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: Yes. Their beef
is forwarded to Great Britain in competition
with ours. I know how cheap cattle are in the
Argentine, for I have been there. They are
brought to Buenos Aires practically on the
hoof, and slaughtered, and the beef is sent
directly to Great Britain in refrigeration boats.
There its high quality commands a substantial
price. The Argentine also exports wheat to
Great Britain. I assume the Minister has
given very serious consideration to those two
items. Chile exports tobacco-another commodity which we produce. Thereforé we
have to protect our farmers with respect to
cattle, wheat and tobacco. There may be
other items as to which we must be very
prudent, in giving substantial advantages in
our market to exporting countries. I do not
know how long these trade agreements are to

81

run, or what notice is required for their
termination, whether six months, a year or
two years. We should also bear in mind the
Atlantic Charter, sponsored by Great Britain
and the United States, which clearly intimates
that after the war there must be a much freer
circulation of commodities throughout the
world, the intent, it seems to me, being to
get rid of tariffs as far as possible.
Hon. Mr. DUFF: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: I do not know
whether that policy is possible so far as
Canada is concerned.
Hon. Mr. DUFF: Why not?
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: I do not know
what would happen if we abolished our tariffs
altogether. It might lead to economic disaster. But at any rate it is important that
we should have full information on these
points. So when the Minister of Trade and
Commerce or someone from his department
appears before our committee, I should like
him to produce a detailed list of all exports
from those countries.
From
Right Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
those countries?
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: Yes; their exportation. Their importation is not important.
We have sold them all we can.
Hon. Mrs. WILSON: The Minister's speech
contains very full details.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: I have not read
the Minister's speech. Neither have I heard
the right honourable leader of the House
mention in detail the exports from those
countries.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Here are two paragraphs.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: It should be explained, for instance, how it is that beef from
the Argentine will not be in competition with
our own; and there may be other items in the
same classification.
Hon. Mr. COTE: Before the resolution is
submitted to the committee, may I say now
wha.t I had intended to say before the motion
was made? I have a feeling that no member
of this House would refuse his willing and
ready assent to the resolution, for the treaties
which have been signed are, I think, the
expression of a popular desire in this country that Canada should by reciprocal arrangements increase its trade both ways with the
South American republics. Whether we are
giving more than we are receiving under the
treaties I do not know, but I am not assuming
that we are.

Commerce.
But I do wish to add this in connection
with South America. I for one welcome the
enlargement of our diplomatie service by the
accrediting of representatives to the Argentine Republic and Chile and Brazil. It is
given to me so seldom to compliment the
AdministrationSome Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. COTE: -that I think I should
net miss this opportunity to commend it very
highly for the two diplomatie appointments
recently made. First is the appointment of
Mr. Justice Turgeon as our Minister to the
Argentine and Chile.
Hon. Mr. Turgeon
needs no introduction to the members of this
Hose or to the Canadian public. He is a
man of'high commercial and legal attainments.
The other is the appointment of Mr. Désy
to Brazil. I know him well. I met him in
Paris when ha was Secretary to our Legation
there. Later he went as our Minister to the
Netherlands. He is well known as a man of
broad culture, wide knowledge, and great
skill and tact.
The names of these two
Ministers have net been mentioned during
the course of the debate, but I feel that by
their presence and their work in the capitals
of the Argentine and Chile and Brazil they
must have been in large measure responsible
for the very successful mission that the
Minister of Trade and Commerce headed to
Latin America.
Some Hon. SENATORS:

Hear, hear.

The motion to refer the resolutions to the
Standing Committee on Banking and Commerce was agreed to.
PRECIOUS

METALS MARKING BILL
SECOND READING

Right Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND moved
the second reading of Bil. 4, an Act to amend
the Precious Metals Marking Act.
He said: This is a very short Bill. Its
purpose is to bring the Precious Metals
Marking Act of Canada into line with the
Hon. Mr. COTÉ.

regulations of the United States regarding the
marking of precious metal, as imposed by the
Bureau of Standards in that country. A large
part of the spectacle ware used in Canada is
imported from the United States and complications have arisen owing to the fact that
there is a slight difference between the
imported article and the domestie product.
At the almost unanimous request of the
Jewellers' Association of Canada-an association which comprises all manufacturers as well
as retailers-there being only one dissenting
voice, this legislation is introduced to make
the regulations uniform. The effect is trifling,
and as regards the protection of the general

The motion was agreed te, and the Bill

PRIVATE BILL
SECOND READING
Hon. L. COTE moved the second reading of
Bill B, an Act to incorporate the Canadian
Dental Association.
He said: Honourable senators, the Canadian
Dental Association is an unincorporated
association which has been in existence for
forty years. Its membership consists of the
dentists and-the dental surgeons in the various
provinces of Canada, in each of which the
association has a branch. The object of the
association is to promote the art of dentistry;
to elevate and maintain professional standards; to disseminate knowledge as to the
necessity of dentistry, and, as it is expressed
in the Bill, of "oral hygiene" throughout the
country.
The members of the association now desire
to become incorporated in order that they
may better achieve their objects, and the
purpose of the Bill is simply to incorporate
the existing Canadian Dental Association and
give it powers which seem to be wholly proper
and within the province of this Parliament
to give.
When the Bill has been read a second time,
I shall move that it be committed for study
to the Standing Committee on Miscellaneous
Private Bills.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: Does the Bill purport
to give the dentists powers of regulation and
discipline?

propriety of postponing the discussion in committee until the associations in all the provinces

Hon. Mr. COTE: Oh, yes. The Bill can

HONG KONG ATROCITIES
STATEMENT IN REPLY TO INQUIRY

Right Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND: Honourable senators, I have the statement which
was made in the other House by the Prime
Minister this afternoon, and to which the
honourable gentleman from Winnipeg SouthCentre (Hon. Mr. Haig) drew my attention.
It reads as f.ollows:
The following is the text of a question and
answer given in the House of Commons at
Westminster at 12 noon to-day, March 10, on
the subject of Hong Kong atrocities.
The
question was as follows:
"To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign
Affairs whether he is yet in a position to make
a statement regarding treatment of military
prisoners and civilians by Japanese army at
Hong Kong after capitulation."
To this question the following Government
statement was made in reply by the Right Hon.
Anthony Eden, Secretary of State for Foreign
Affairs:
"Yes, sir. Out of regard for the feelings of
the thousands of relations of the victims, His
Majesty's Government have been unwilling to
publish any accounts of Japanese atrocities at
Hong Kong until these had been confirmed
beyond any possibility of doubt.
"His Majesty's Government are now in possession of statements by reliable eye-witnesses who
succeeded in escaping fron Hong Kong towards
the end of January or early in February. Their
testimony established the fact that Japanese
army at Hong Kong perpetrated against their
helpless military prisoners and civil population
without distinction of race or colour the same
kind of barbarities which aroused the horror
of the civilized world at the time of Nanking
massacre of 1937.
"It is known that 50 officers and men of the
British were bound hand and foot and then
bayoneted to death. It is known that ten days
after capitulation wounded were still being
collected from the hills, and Japanese were
refusing permission to bury the dead. It is
known- that women, both Asiatie and European,
were raped and murdered, and that one entire
Chinese district was declared a brothel, regardless of status of inhabitants.
"All the survivors of the garrison, including
Indian, Chinese and Portuguese, have been
herded into a camp consisting of wrecked huts
without doors, windows, light or sanitation.
By the end of January 150 cases of dysentery
had occurred, but no drugs or medical facilities
were supplied. The dead had to be buried in
a corner of the camp. The Japanese guards are
utterly callous, and the repeated requests of
General Maltby, the General Officer Commanding, for an interview with the Japanese Commander have been curtly refused. This presumably means that the Japanese High Command have connived at the conduct of their
forces. The Japanese Government stated at
the end of February that numbers of prisoners
in Hong Kong were British 5,072, Canadian
1,689, Indian 3,829, others 357, total 10,947.
"Most of the European residents, including
some who are seriously ill, have been interned,
and, like the military prisoners, are being given
only a little rice and water and occasionally
scraps of other food.

84

SENATE

"There is some reason ta believe that conditions have been slightly improved since the
date on which the eye-witnesses, whom I have
quoted, escaped, but the Japanese Government
have refused their consent to a visit to Hong
Kong of a representative of protecting power,
and no permission has yet been granted for such
a visit by representative of International Red
Cross Committee. They have in fact announced
that they require all foreign consuls to withdraw
from all territories they have invaded since the
outbreak of the war. It is clear that their
treatment of prisoners and civilians will not
bear independent investigation.
"I have no information as to condition of
our prisoners of war and civilians in Malaya.
The only report available is a statement by the
Japanese official news agency of March 3
stating that 77,699 Chinese have been arrested
and subjected to what is described as 'a severe
It is not difficult to imagine
exan:ination.'
what that entails.
"I am sorry that I have had ta make such
a statement to the House. Two things will be
clear from it, to the House, to the country and
to the world. The Japanese claim that their
forces are aniiated by a lofty code of chivalry,
bushido, is a nauscating hypocrisy. That is
the first. The second is that the eniemy must
be utterly defeated. The House will agree
witli me that we can best express our sympathy
with the victims of these appalling outrages by
redoubling our efforts to ensure his utter and
overwhelming defeat."
The Prime Minister, Mr. King, added these
remarks:
I am informied by our High Commissioner in
London that. on the basis of information so far
received, United Kingdon authorities agree
that of all the reports of specific atrocities
received to date none are alleged to have been
committed against Canadians, but no reports
show that in so far as general treatment of
prisoners of war is concerned Japanese have
made any differentiation between Canadians and
other British troops.
Words cannot begin to express the sense of
outrage and the feeling of bitter resentment
to which this announcement of Japanese
atrocities at Hong Kong is certain to give
rise, among civilized peoples everywhere, and
nowhere more than in the different countries
of the British Empire and in the United States,
with which Japan is at war.
Retribution for barbarie behaviour of the
kind will follow in full mîeasure in due course.
Meanwhile, nunbers of Canadians, both soldiers
and civilians, in Hong Kong and in other parts
of the Far East, are now and will continue
for sonie tinie to be at the nercy of the
Japanese forces. Remembering this fact, it is
of the utnost importance that no act of
vengeance should be permitted or taken against
persons of Japanese origin in our country,
since any such acts might be made an excuse
for acts of retaliation upon Canadian soldiers
or citizens in the Orient.
I may add that the Canadian Government,
in conjunction with the Governments of
Australia, India, the United Kingdom and the
United States, are making every effort, both
through the countries which are protecting their
interests in eneny countries and through the
International Red Cross, to get into personal
touch with prisoners of war and others. The
object of all these enquiries is twofold: to
Right Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

secure all possible authentic information, and
also to bring such measure of relief in the
nature of medical supplies, food and personal
comforts, as can possibly be arranged.
EASTER RECESS
INQUIRY

On the motion to adjourn:
Hon. J. T. HAIG: Honourable members, I
should like to ask a question of the leader of
the House.
I notice the Prime Minister
has announced that the House of Commons
will adjourn for the Easter recess fiom
March 27 to April 20. Can the right honourable leader tell us what suggestion ha will
make for the Easter adjournment of this
House?
Right Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The House
of Commons arranges its sittings and its
adjournments ta suit itself, and of course likewise the Senate is master of its own procedure.
I have not yet looked into the
question of when our Easter adjournment
should begin and end.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Honourable members, if
I am permitted, I shall explain in a few
words why I raised this question.
It bas
been raised in this Chamber a hundred times
before, I suppose, and I presume that after
w-e all are gone it will be raised a hundred
times more. We who live in distant parts
of the country-and our number includes at
least half the membership of this Househave to sit around day after day for considerable periods, kicking our heels. We certainly
should like to have some idea of the dates of
the Easter adjournment. Some of us have
not much business, it is true. but we have at
least a little to attend ta, and I say to the
right honourable leader that iL is very unfair
to us not to be informed of such dates at
least two or three weeks in advance, in order
that we may make certain necessary arrangements. The Prime Minister is giving the
House of Commons nearly tirce wecks' notice
of the adjournment of that House, and I think
the Senate is entitled to at least as much
notice.
Right Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: My honourable friend will recognize that my first duty
is to find out what legislation must come to
us before we adjourn. I shall try to get that
information, througb contact with my colleagues, as soon as possible, in order that I
may maRe a statement to the House without
any avoidable delay. It will be obvions that
I must ask the Minister of Finance whether it
is necessary that a money bill, in one form or
another, be passed before we separate. I have

MARCH 10, 1942
already made that inquiry and been told that
that will have to be done, but I do flot know
when the bill may reach here, nor what it
will cover.
I would remind my honourable friend that
I arn constantly preo.ceupied in trying to learn
in due tirne what I can do in the interests
of the country-for it is the country's interests
that we are serving here-at the same tirne
keeping in mind the convenience of honourable
senators, especially those whose homes are
distant. I repeat what 1 have often said,
that I have considerable sympathy for honourable members who corne from the extreme
ends of the country, especially for those from
the extrerne West, who are unable to reach
their homes in less than three or four days.
They must naturally feel that we who live
within one hundred miles of Ottawa are
privileged, as we can pass our week-ends at
home whiIe they are waîting around bere,
sometimes doing nothing. I am aware of all
this, and it is my particular interest to see that
this family of ours whicha constitutes the rnemabership of the Senate is treated as fairly as
possible.
Before we adjourn I would express the hope
that the Banking and Commerce Committee
may meet to-morrow morning at eleven o'clock,
to deal witb the South American -trade treaties.
And if there is nothing on the Senate's order
paper, we may continue to study these treaties
in committee during the afternoon.
The Senate adjourned until to-morrow at
3 p.m.

TRADE AGREEMENTS WITH CHILE,
BRAZIL AND THE ARGENTINE
REPUBIO
REPORT 0F COMMITTEE-AGREEMENTS
APPROVED

Hon. F. B. BLACK presented the report of
the Standing Committee on Banking and
Commerce on a message from the House of
Commons acquainting the Senate that they
had approved the trade agreements entered
into with Chile, Brazil and the Argentine
Republic and asking the Senate to concur ini
the said approval.
He said: Honourable senators, I may say
for the benefit of those who were not at

85

the meeting of our committee this morning
that we had before us the Minister of Trade
and Commerce and bis Deputy, wbo gave us
a very clear exposition of the points on these
trade agreemnents, and answered ail questions
put to them to the satisfaction, I believe, of
ail members present. I move that the report
be concurred in.
The motion was agreed to.
Hon. J. H. KING: Honourable senators, the
right bonourable leader (Rigbt Hon. Mr.
Dandurand) will not be present this afternoon, but hie is desirous that we proceed
with and approve these agreements.
As the Chairman of the Standing Committee
on Trade and Commerce (Hon. Mr. Black)
lias stated, the committee this morning had
before it the Minister of Trade and Commerce
and his Deputy. I tbink their evidence was
satisfactory, not only to members of the
committee, but also to other honourable
senators who attended. It should seem tbat
we are f ortunate in baving concluded these
trade agreements with the South American
republics. The Minister, in bis statement to
the House of Commons, dealt very fully with
the trade carried on by these countries witb
Canada up to the year 1941, and anyone who
takes time to read tbat statement will find it
very instructive. The Minister very properly
and wisely, I think, referred to tbe courtesy
and hospîtality shown. to bim and to bis delegation while they were visiting those great
republics to the south. We in Canada do
not fully realize the development that bias
occurred ini those countries, and the great
opportunity for trade and commerce with
tbem.
I do not tbink it is necessary to extend my
remarks further. I would move the resolutions,
tbree in number, relating to tbe countries of
Chule, Argentina. and Brazil. The first is:
That it is expedient that tbe Senate and the
House of Commons do approve the Trade
Agreement hetween Canada and Chile, signed
September 10, 1941, and that the Senate do
approve the samie.
Hon. J. A. CALDER: Honourable nierabers, frorn what I hear, the clouds which
appeared on the horizon yesterday have ail disappeared. This, I understand, is chiefly because the agreements contain no details at ail.
They do not refer to specific imports or exports
or anything of that kind. Ahl they do, as I
understand it, is to provide that each of the
countries concerned shahl give favoured-nation
treatment to the other. Consequently I should
think there can be no objection on the part of

W0

SENATE

any person. These agreements are very similar
to, if not the same as, agreements we have
made previously with other countries.
The motion was agreed to.
Hon. Mr. KING: I would move:
That it is expedient that the Senate and the
House of Con:inons do approve the Trade
Agreeient between Canada and the Argentine
Republie, signed October 2, 1941, and that the
Senate do approve the same.
The motion was agreed to.
Hon. Mr. KING: In regard to the agreement between Canada and the Republic of
Brazil, I would move:
That it is expedient that the Senate and the
House of Commons do approve the Tiade
Agreement between Canada and Brazil, signed
October 17, 1941, and that the Senate do
approve the saine.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK:
Honourable senators, I do not know anything about these
agreements, and I doubt whether there are
three members of this Chamber who have seen
them. While it may be quite right and proper
to adopt them, we are just being asked to
become rubber stamps and approve of something we have never seen or read, and probably shall not see for sorne time, if ever.
Hon. Mr. KING: I think my honourable
friend is hardly fair. This matter bas certainly
been discussed in the House of Commons, and
the Minister made a very comprehensive
statement there. My honourable friend, as a
member of this Chamber, surely cannot have
acquainted himself with all the information
which was given in the House of Commons.
Hon. J. T. HAIG: Honourable senators, I
had the pleasure of attending the meeting of
the Committee on Banking and Commerce
this morning. I went there in a quite critical
frame of mind; my attitude was very much
like that which bas just been expressed by
the honourable gentleman from Parkdale
(Hon. Mr. Murdock); but when I heard the
explanation given by the Minister, and
especially that by the Deputy Minister, I
had no criticism wbatevcr to offer. They
simply told us that they made the same
agreements as are made with other countries.
The Government of each of these countries
agrees to extend to us whatever preferences it
may give to any other country, and we in turn
agree that any preferences we give to other
countries shall be extended to these three
countries. There are no special concessions on
anything. These three nations apply favourednation-treaty provisions to us, and we do the
same to them. It is not a case of our signing
something blindly.
Hon. Mr. CALDER.

Last night I agreed with the honourable
senator from Prince (Hon. Mr. MacArthur),
but I changed my mind after attending the
committee meeting this morning. ýI think I
can say that at the committee we were completely convinced by the Minister, and
especially by the Deputy Minister. I might
say under my breath that I was delighted
with the Deputy Minister. In my opinion
the Government bas made a good deal. The
agreement will not result in a great volume
of trade just now, on account of the war and
the lack of shipping. That is the problem,
the Iack of shipping. But a good atmosphere
bas been created. I gathered from the
Minister and the Deputy Minister that these
countries feel friendly towards Canada, and
that these agreements are but the beginning. I
am not trying to defend the Government; I
am simply saying that after what I heard at
the committee I consider that a good deal,
a reasonable deal, was made.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: May I ask my
honourable friend a question? Is it mostfavoured-nation treatment that is involved,
or the intermediate tariff?
Hon. C. P. BEAUBIEN: It is the same
thing.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: It is favoured-nation
treatment. If one of these countries negotiates with the United States, for instance,
and makes some special concession to that
country, it would have to make the same
concession to us.
That is favoured-nation
treatment.
We have to extend the same
treatment to them. If we make any special
concession to any nation in the same territory
as Chili, Brazil or Argentina, we must extend
that same concession to these three countries.
Hon. Mr. DUFF: That is, if we make any
special concession to any country outside of
the British Empire-to any foreign country.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Perhaps the Minister did
not intend to emphasize this, but I know what
impressed me was the statement that these
treaties created a good feeling among these
South American nations towards Canada. The
United States bas been exerting itself to
build up a good spirit with South America,
and Canada so far bas not been very well
known to the countries down there. Now
they are welcoming us as traders. I honestly
think that agreements like these will help
not only Canada, but the British Empire, to
have a better understanding with the countries
involved.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: We had an unfavourable balance of trade of $11,346,000 with
Brazil last year.

87

MARCH 11, 1942
Hon. Mr. KING: I just want to inforrn the
Senate that these agreements were tabled in
the Senate on November 3 last year. If
honourable senators did not familiarize themselves with these papers, it is surely a reflection
an no one but themselves.
The motion was agreed to.
Hon. Mr. KING: Then I would move:
That a message be sent to the House of
Commons to acquaint that House that the
Senate has approved trade agreements entered
into with Chile, Brazil and the Argentine
Republic.
Hon. CREELMAN MacARTHUR: Honourable senators, one might consider that the
adoption of the report brought in by the
Chairman of the Committee on Banking and
Commerce would bring about the happy consummation of these treaties, if the three South
American countries concerned had ratified
them; but now we find several further resolutions to be passed. I may be wrong, but
I think they are superfluous. We certainly
expected when we went to the committee this
morning that something would be placed
before us in the way of a paper that would
show the industries of the different countries
affected, their exports, their imports, and the
total amount of money involved in one way
or another. But we did not have that. However, it was felt generally by the committee
that the Minister and the Deputy Minister
made out a good case, and the committee
accepted the agreements. I do not think there
should be any apprehension as to their outcome. At the same time it seems to me that
this House has not been treated fairly in the
way of being given information; I believe we
should have more detailed information about
the whole transaction and the agreements.
Agreements will be made with five or six
other South American countries, in all probability, and we shall have to go all over this
kind of thing again. I do not understand why
the Minister did not line up all the republies
of South America when he was down there,
and why he did not present all the agreements
to us at one time, when we could have before
us details of the givings and the takings, so
as to know where we stood. We did not get
that information this morning. But there was
a disposition to be lenient to the Minister
and his Deputy because they seemed to
present a good case and to satisfy the conmittee that everything was lovely. Well, it
may be, but we do not know for certain. It
is not a big matter, in one way, but we should

know on which side of the books the balance
is struck and we should know more about the
items that are to be imported and exported.
I am not objecting to these agreements. I

have every confidence in the Minister of
Trade and Commerce, because lie married a
girl from my town, -and that counts for something. I do not think we need worry about
being at any disadvantage. At the same time,
when we are dealing with treaties we should
not have too much sentiment and too much
of this goodwill factor. We should know
where we stand with regard to our trade
undertakings and our rights. That is my
position.
Hon. B. F. SMITH: Honourable senators,
it seems to me that in this period of Canada's
life it is highly desirable that we should try
to reach out and secure all the markets we
possibly can, because trade bas been so disrupted by the war that we cannot tell just
where we shall be after the war is over. I
have read these agreements very carefully,
and I know they affect that portion of New
Brunswick from which I come; and I have
this to say, that I think they are highly commendable. There may be some points in them
that one could find fault with, but I wish to
voice my sentiment as being, generally speaking, in favour of them.

The motion was agreed to.
WAR PLANT EMPLOYEES
RETURN
On the inquiry by Hon. Mr. Sauvé:
1. Is the Government keeping any supervision or checking on the number, the classification and the protection of persons employed
in war plants?

2. Are those persons granted any indemnity

in case of disease contracted in war plants?

Hon. Mr. KING: I would, suggest that this
inquiry be treated as an order for a return, and
I table the return forthwith.

On the Order for the second reading of Bill C,

Life Assurance Company.
Hon. Sir ALLEN AYLESWORTH: Honourable members, the honourable senator from
East York (Hon. Mr. McGuire), who introduced this Bill, is not able to be here to-day,
and I would suggest that the second reading
of the Bill had better stand until next week.
Some Hon. SENATORS:

Carried.

SENATE
DIVORCE JURISDICTION BILL
SECOND

READING POSTPONED

Hon. A. B. COPP moved the second reading of Bill D, an Act to amend The Divorce
Jurisdiction Act, 1930.
He said:
Honourable senators, the Bill
standing in my name is exactly the same Bill
which this House passed late in the last session of Parliament. The Bill went over to the
House of Commons, but, owing to it being
put at the foot of the list of orders there, it was
not reached.
Hon. Mr. COTE: Does the honourable
gentleman know that the Bill has not yet been
distributed?
Hon. Mr. COPP: I know. I was going to
refer to that.
This Bill was referred to a special committee of this House, which gave it careful consideration and made some amendments to it.
Later it was passed by the House. I have no
desire to rush the Bill through if anybody
objects that it has not been distributed, but,
as I have said, it is exactly the same Bill as
the one passed by this House, and I thought
it might be accepted.
Hon. Mr. COTE: I for one should like to
have the Bill in my hand before it is proceeded with.
Hon. Mr. COPP:

Next sitting.

The motion for second reading stands.
SITTINGS OF THE SENATE
DISCUSSION

Hon. Mr. KING: Honourable senators, we
apparently have reached the end of the Order
Paper. The right honourable leader (Right
Hon. Mr. Dandurand) has expressed the desire
that when the Senate adjourns to-day it should
stand adjourned until eight o'clock on Tuesday
next, and I would so move.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Before the motion is
put, I should like to suggest that we adjourn
to the following Monday, the 23rd of March.
That would leave us a week in which to attend
to any bills coming from the other House.
The members of the other Chamber, I
understand, are discussing the Wheat Bill,
which is a very contentious measure, and I am
convinced that the discussion will take some
time. The only other bill they have is the
bill for the rehabilitation of returned soldiers,
which also will take some time. If we come
back next Tuesday, it looks to me as though
we should have to sit around on Tuesday and
Wednesday, and then adjourn again. Would
it not be just as satisfactory to the Government if we were to adjourn now until the
Hon. Sir Allen AYLESWORTH.

23rd of March. If some contingency should
arise, His Honour the Speaker could call the
House together again, as was done a week ago.
An adjournment to the 23rd would give
members who live at a distance a chance to
go home. I am not desirous of going home
if there is anything to be done here, but
it is a terrible job just sitting around Ottawa
doing practically nothing.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: The Divorce Committee will be sitting every day.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: The Divorce Committee
is not essential to life.
Hon. Mr. LITTLE: It is to some people.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I suggest that we adjourn
to the 23rd. The Government, of course,
will have an Appropriation Bill, but when we
come back that can be put through in a very
short time. I can see no reason for a long
debate in this House on the Wheat Bill. The
Rehabilitation Bill may require some consideration, but it does not need to be rushed.
So far as the Divorce Committee is concerned, it could sit during the recess.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: The honourable
gentleman is a member of the Divorce Committee, and it is going to sit every day between
now and next Tuesday.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Honourable members,
the right honourable leader on the other side
(Right Hon. Mr. Dandurand) has indicated his
desire to have the House sit on Tuesday.
We know from experience that when he
reaches a decision of that kind he does so
after consultation with those who are watching
very closely the proceedings in the other
House. I am inclined to agree that the situation is about as it has been outlined by the
honourable senator from Winnipeg SouthCentre (lon. Mr. Haig), but our leader must
have had sene reason for desiring us to meet
again on Tuesday night. In the circumstances
it secms to me that the motion had better
stand as it is.
Hon. Mr. KING: I may say, honourabIe
senators, that the honourable gentleman from
Peel (Hon. Mr. Marshall) made a suggestion
similar to that just made by the honourable
gentleman from Winnipeg South-Centre (Hon.
Mr. Haig).
However, after I heard from
the right honourable leader (Right Hon. Mr.
Dandurand) I was talking to the Prime Minister, and I learned it is the desire of the
Government that we should meet next week.
The day and hour for resuming have been
set by the right honourable leader of the
Senate, and I should hesitate to consider any

MARCH 11, 1942
change unless I had time to confer. I know
the Government is desirous that we meet next
Tuesday evening at eight o'clock.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Then I make this suggestion to the acting leader of the House
(Ho'n. Mr. King), that he ask the Government to send the Supplementary Supply Bill
over to us next week, so that we may adjourn
next week.
Hon. Mr. KING: I think that is the hope.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Let it be more than hope.
Let it be a fact.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: We cannot control
the House of Commons.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: It seems to me that
senators who live in Ontario or Quebec, as
well as those who live in remote parts of
the country, but do not go home often, might
give some consideration to those of us whose
homes are distant and who want to get to
them when there is nothing for us to do here.
Hon. Mr. LACASSE: It is another case
of being too near and yet too far.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I believe that if the
leader of this House asked the Government
to send over the Supplementary Supply Bill
next week, we could adjourn next week.
Hon. Mr. KING: I think that is the hope
of the Government, and the intention, if it
can be carried out. We may get through
next week and adjourn.
Hon. Mr. MacARTHUR: Honourable senators, I would suggest that we should. never
fix Monday as a day for resuming sittings of
the Senate; that it should be Tuesday at
the earliest; because it is impossible for any
person to get here on Monday from Prince
Edward Island, unless he leaves on Saturday.
There is no Sunday crossing to the mainland;
and if we leave on Monday it takes us all
our time to get here by Tuesday night. I
appeal to the honourable senator from Cardigan (Hon. Mr. MacDonald) and the honourable senator from Queen's (Hon. Mr. Sinclair)
to confirm what I say. What my wife and I
went through on Monday and Tuesday of this
week, in trying to get here for Tuesday night,
makes me even want to resign from the
Senate.
Most honourable members have no idea
how bad the C.N.R. service is at Sackville
and Moncton. The management-there is no
management. We do not intend to put up
with it. We are going to have a strong
delegation, with a view to shaking up the
C.N.R. and getting some kind of service.
When my wife and I were coming up here

89

we could not fly, because it was raining; we
had to take a train. There were broken
wheels on the Ocean Limited; a man was
killed by the Scotian which we were on; and
instead of arriving at Montreal at 8.55, we
got there only at a quarter to two. We took
the 4.30 train and arrived here just in time
for me to take my seat in the Senate Tuesday
evening. That kind of thing is too strenuous;
the indemnity is not enough to compensate
for it. I do not want to lose a day, to be
penalized $20 a day for not being in my
seat, but I do not intend to come here on
a Monday. Senators whose homes are on
the main line have no difficulty in making
connections and getting here in a reasonable
time, but our situation in Prince Edward
Island is far different. We intend to have a
delegation, and to shake up the Intercolonial
end of the C.N.R.
Hon. Mr. DUFF: What about a new ferryboat?
Hon. Mr. MacARTHUR: That does not
come into this. So far as Prince Edward
Island is concerned, in a very short time it
will either be a province of Canada or it will
not. It is the only province in the country
whose population bas decreased. We are not
getting the service we are entitled to. Here
is the Government about to spend $1,500,000
on a plebiscite, enough to get a new boat
to replace the one that was sunk. Evidently,
according to the latest reports, no attempt
is to be made even to salvage the former
ferry, although a million dollars of insurance
was collected on her; it seems she is to be
allowed to lie where she is. Down off New
Zealand, where the water is much deeper and
salvaging conditions are far more difficult,
millions of dollars' worth of gold were retrieved. But up here we can only let our
ferry lie on the bottom.
Hon. Mr. WHITE: Why not build a
tunnel?
Hon. Mr. MacARTHUR: When you get to
Sackville or Moncton you might as well be in
a village, so far as the C.N.R. is concerned,
for there is no information to be obtained
at either place, there is no management or
anything else. I could tell you of a business
man who came to Moncton and was given
three or four conflicting sets of instructions
about how to get to a certain place, and who
at last decided it would be wiser not to go by
train at all, but to go by bus.
As I have said, we came up on the Scotian.
We had no observation car, such as there was
on the Ocean Limited. We paid extra for a
Pullman, but we were put on a second-class
car; and when we got into Montreal it was

90

SENATE

nearly two o'clock, instead of 8.55, as it should
have been. That is the service we are getting.
Something must be donc. We intend to get
a delegation or a committee to see that something is done very soon.
The motion was agreed to.
The Senate adjourned until Tuesday, March
17, at 8 p.m.

THE

LATE

SENATORS DANDURAND
AND RHODES

TRIBUTES

TO THEIR MEMORY

Hon. J. H. KING: Honourable senators,
when we met last Wednesday I advised this
Chamber that the Right Honourable Senator
Dandurand would net be present, but that
it was his desire that we should carry on and
complete the business on the Order Paper, and
adajourn until Tuesday evening of this week.
That direction was characteristic of the right
honourable leader. Since that time the hand
of fate has removed him, and also the
Honourable Senator Rhodes. The passing of
these two senators, I know, has brought deep
sadness and regret te the heart of each and
every one of us in this Chamber.
Our late leader, Senator Dandurand, rarely
if ever complained that legislation was not
sent over ta us from the House of Commons
when, from time to time, many members of the
Senate thought it should have been. He was an
old parliamentarian and knew better than some
of us younger members the relationship of
the Senate with the House of Commons. He
tried to instil in the group on this side of the
House the idea that the Senate should so conduct itself as to be a revising body carefully
considering in a non-political way, and where
necessary revising, measures passed by the
House of Commons, and thus contributing to
the welfare of this country. Among us on this
side he discouraged political caucuses. I think
I can truly say that our caucuses were held
only for the purpose of selecting what is cornmonly known in parliamentary circles as a
whip, a party representative to consult and be
in contact with those who might have views
opposed to ours. At the time of coming to
this Chamber every senator is an adherent of a
political party. From my experience in this
House and in its committees over the last
twelve years, I believe it was the real desire
Hon. Mr.

MacARTHUR.

and hope of Senator Dandurand, while he was
our leader on the left of the Speaker, as well
as since we moved to the right, that in dealing
with legislation we should avoid partisanship,
and I am sure he did succeed in converting
many of us who when we came here brought
our political views with us fron the other
House or elsewhere.
Our right honourable leader was, I think,
the oldest member of this Chamber. He was
born in Montreal on November 4, 1861,
received his degree of LL.B. from Laval
University in 1882, was received at the Bar
of the province of Quebec in 1883, and was
summoned to the Senate by Lord Aberdeen
on January 22, 1898. He has at all times
actively engaged in the work of this assembly.
He presided as Speaker of the Senate during
the years 1905 to 1909. On the formation of
the King Administration in 1921 he became
Minister of State and continued as leader of
the Liberal party in this body until bis
passing last Wednesday.
He had a remarkable career, not only in the
political life of Canada, but also in educational
and university circles, having been honoured
with the degree of LL.D. by McGill University
in 1910, by the University of Toronto in 1925,
and by Queens in 1927. In 1934 be became
president of the University of Montreal.
In the financial and industrial life of
Canada he took a prominent part, being
president of the Montreal City and District
Savings Bank and the Fire Insurance Company
of Canada, and a director of the Montreal
Trust and Deposit Company, the Montreal
Cotton Company, the Sun Life Assurance
Company and the Western Canadian Collieries.
From a conversation I had with him, I understand that he joined the directorate of the
Sun Life Assurance Company as representative
of the stockholders.
He practised his profession in the city of
Montreal.
The late Senator Dandurand was also well
known in the international field of polities,
being one of the Canadian representatives
at the Assembly of the League of Nations in
Geneva in 1924. He became President of the
Assembly in 1925. He was a delegate ta the
Council of the League from 1927 to 1930. He
was also honoured by the President of the
United States, having been appointed ta act
as arbitrator under the terms of the Treaty of
Peace with the Republic of Brazil. I may
add that while connected with the League of
Nations be was always noted for his support
of minority groups in that organization.
He wilil ba greatly missed in this assembly,
and his going will be our loss.

MARCH 17, 1942
The Honourable Mr. Rhodes was born in
Nova Scotia, and was a graduate of Acadia
and Dalhousie universities. He became identified with the profession of law, and was a
director of the 'Rhodes-Curry operations at
Amherst, a very large and important industrial
activity in the Maritimes. He also was identified with the military life of this country, being
an honorary colonel of the Cumberland Highlanders.
He had an -outstanding political
career. He was first elected to the House of
Commons in 1908, and was re-elected in 1911
and again in 1917. He became Deputy Speaker
of the House of Commons on February 3,
1916, and was elected Speaker of that House
on January 18, 1917, continuing in that position
during 1917 and 1918. If one will look up
Hansard, I think one will find that it was
during his term of office that Sir Wilfrid
Laurier, who was then in opposition, suggested
to the House of Commons that it might be
wise te adopt the British practice and make
the Honourable
Mr. Rhodes permanent
Speaker of that House during his lifetime. No
greater compliment could have been paid te
any man.
In 1925, at the call, I suppose, of his party,
Mr. Rhodes went back te the province of
Nova Scotia and was elected te the Legislature. He became the Premier and Provincial
Secretary in July, 1925. He was re-elected at
the generail election of October, 1928.
On August 11, 1930, be resigned the premiership of Nova Scotia te accept the portfolio
of Minister of Fisheries in the Dominion
Government, a position which he held until
February, 1932, when he was appointed
Minister of Finance. I think all will agree
with me when I say that during the depression years of 1932, 1933 and 1934 Mr. Rhodes
had te carry a 'tremendous burden. No doubt
this did much to affect his health, for it was
only shortly after he came te this Chamber
in 1935 that he suffered an illness which curtailed his usefulness here.
As I feel certain that many other honourable members desire to speak of their association with these two men, I shall simply conclude with the statement that I am confident
of expressing the view and the wish of the
Senate of Canada when I say that we part
from these men with great regret and we offer
our sincere sympathy te the members of
the families they have left behind them in
their passage to the great beyond.
Hon. C. C. BALLANTYNE: Honourable
senators, I am sure that the heart of every
honourable senator here to-night is filled with
deep sorrow and regret as we remember that
just a week ago to-night our late dis-

tinguished leader was with us in his accustomed place, speaking and leading this Chamber with his usual dignity and vigour, and we
now realize that he will be with us no more.
The Right Honourable Senator Dandurand
was an aristocratie gentleman of the old school.
At the same time he was most unassuming
and kind-hearted. He died as I am sure he
wouild have wished-at his post of duty.
Senator Dandurand's demise was unexpected,
and came with great suddenness. He had
lived a full life, and he will go down in history
as one cf Canada's most distinguished citizens,
a man who for forty-four years in the Parliament of Canada, with great loyalty and
devotion, gave of his talents and ability for
the benefit of the country of his birth. His
activities were net confined exclusively to
Canada, for be was a figure in international
world affairs.
What a splendid record of
achievement!
I have mentioned the great services rendered
by our late leader during his long public
career, but I wish te emphasize another side
of his character, with which, perhaps, the
public are less familiar because of his innate
modesty. He did much for the poor and
the needy, but did it in an anonymous way.
He was particularly interested in education,
and especially in Stanislas College, which he
instituted.
I feel the loss of my old and good friend,
Senator Dandurand, most keenly. It has been
my privilege te know him for a very great
number of years. During the past few weeks,
while I have been acting leader on this side
of the House, I have been brought into very
close contact with him in regard te matters
coming before the Senate. I was always
gladly received by him and given a warm
welceome when I entered his office, and it was
an honour and a pleasure to be su closely
associated with him. The Senate of Canada
lias been fortunate in having many brilliant
leaders since Confederation, but none was
more experienced, more talented or more
highly thought of than the late Senator
Dandurand.
The honourable the acting leader on the
other side of the House (Hon. Mr. King) bas
mentioned the attitude and views of the late
distinguished leader of the Senate as te the
manner in which this Chamber should funetien. Speaking for myself, and, I think, for
those associated with me on this side of the
House, I certainly agree with the views of
our late leader. 1, like the acting leacer
opposite, came from the other House, where
there is a more partisan atmosphere than in

this Chamber. I know that on, coming here
first one must put a check on partisan feelings,

92

SENATE

because the Senate does not lend itself to
acrimonious political debate as does the other
House. The Senate of Canada performs a
very important work, and I am only sorry
that more legislation has not been originated
in this Chamber. I will go so far as to say
that the committee work of this House is much
more efficient and effective than that of the
other House, the reason being, as our late
leader would say if he were present with us
to-night, that we are not thinking in a partisan
way, but have in mind only one thing, namely,
the improvement of the legislation before us.
I am sure there will be many other speakers
to-night; so I shall close my remarks by
simply joining with the acting leader of the
Government in this Chamber in expressing
the heartfelt sympathy and sorrow of all who
sit on this side of the House.
In the death of Senator Rhodes another
distinguished Nova Scotian has passed away.
The province of Nova Scotia has given to
Canada not only since Confederation, but
before, many notable and illustrious men like
Sir John Thompson, Hon. Joseph Howe and
Hon. W. S. Fielding-to mention but a few.
The name of Senator Rhodes is justly entitled
to appear on that list.
I was in the House of Commons when Mr.
Rhodes was appointed to the exalted post of
Speaker, and I may say that he presided over
.hat House with great dignity and efficiency.
Hle was a master of the rules and his decisions
were always fair. I cannot remember any of
his rulings ever having been challenged by a
single member of that House. On the contrary,
I believe the acting leader of the Senate (Hon.
Mr. King) was quite correct when he stated
to-night that the late Right Hon. Sir Wilfrid
Laurier suggested to Sir Robert Borden the
wisdom and advisability of appointing Mr.
Rhodes as permanenýt Speaker of the House of
Commons.
Senator Rhodes entered public life at the
early age of 31. He could, of course, have
followed the profession of law, but his interest
in public affairs and his desire to do ail that
he possibly could, not only for his native
province, but for Canada as a whole, induced
him to enter public life. I need not recount
his political achievements, but may I concur in
what the acting leader bas said as to the difficulties of the time when the late Senator
Rhodes was appointed Minister of Finance in
1930. England at that time had gone off the
gold standard and the currencies of ail the
European countries were rapidly falling. Not
only did our own financial affairs have to be
adjusted almost daily to meet new situations,
but our tariffs also required attention. About
that time the Bank of Canada was formed.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE.

I believe that those trying years in which
Senator Rhodes performed the duties of Minister of Finance certainly impaired his health,
and I will go even further and say that I
think they shortened his life by at least ten
years. In these modern times a man of 66 is
not considered old.
I hope that the example set by Senator
Rhodes in entering public life at so young an
age will make an appeal to the young men of
Canada, especially to the young lawyers.
If ever there is a time when youth is
required in Parliament, it is now. I trust that
our young men will read about the life of
Senator Rhodes, be inspired by it and try to
do likewise. On behalf of those on this side
of the House, I join with the acting leader in
extending our most sincere sympathy to the
son and daughter and other members of the
family of Senator Rhodes in their great
bereavement.
Rigbt Hon. GEORGE GRAHAM: Honourable senators, I have sat here by the side of
our late leader, Senator Dandurand, for a good
many years and listened to remarks addressed
te him by honourable members opposite. They
always gave us something to think about. As
I have lookcd across at bonourable members
on the other side of the House I have always
known that they, like those who sat around
me, were my friends. I hope that as long as
I am a member of the Senate I shall be surrounded by friends, for nothing sustains a
man's life stream like friendship. There is
nothing better ýthan to be associated with
those who will say a good wordi for you,
whether they are wit you or against yo'u.
My sitting with Senator Dandurand was
al:ways a tonic to me. Every time I met him
he had something fine to say. Honourable
senators behind me, as well as those facing
me, believe that Dandurand was ýright in his
seul. One day shortly after I joined him over
bere he called me to his office. That was
nothing new to me, for I had been called into
offices often over a good iany years. He
simply told me a thing or two. I said to
1im, "That sounds reasonable, but do you
expect ail of us to bo reasonable?" He said,
"No." Our close association lasted until the
time of his deatb. I never knew a man casier
to get along with than Senator Dandurand.
You could live with him on a level keel all
the time.
The acting leader (Hon. Mr. King) wants
me to make a speech. I have given up making speeches, mostly because I do not like the
job. Besides, other chaps always get up and
make them ahead of me. In any event, there
is no need for me to say much about Senator
Dandurand's life work. It was almost bound-

political schools as far apart as it was then
possible to conceive. I say that because,
with my early political training, I was far
from sympathetically disposed towards him,
and I feel now that I certainly can judge his
life at least in full freedom and impartiality.
I well remember that continual and disheartening contest against Laurier at the
period when he really dominated the province
of Quebec. Virtually the whole merit of
Laurier's success was credited to the old
Liberal chieftain. I have often thought the
senator's services were not altogether appreciated as they should have been at the time.
Laurier was no doubt a great statesman, and
his shining glory threw most of his collaborators into the shade. But as Laurier spoke
before colossal and well-organized meetings,
Dandurand was constantly on the battlefield
organizing and directing the Liberal forces.
His unbounded activity, resourcefulness,
diplomacy, courage and optimism were a host
in themselves.
After the elections of -1908 a Liberal said
to a leading Conservative: "I was surprised
at your defeat. You had a good chief, a
good policy and excellent candidates. What
did you lack?" The Conservative answered
in one word: "Dandurand." I need say no
more to show the extent to which Senator
Dandurand was valued by his political
opponents.
But the senator was far from being a slave
to his party. At the beginning of this century

94

SENATE

gathered in their wake many of the other
delegations, and our colleague was elected by
a comfortable majority.
At his inauguration as president the senator
spoke first in French, according to tradition,
as 80 per cent of the discussions were carried
on in that language. As he ended his oration,
the official interpreter-a man of universal
reputation as such-rose, as usual, to give the
English translation. The senator waved him
gently aside and made his speech anew in
perfect English.
The audience, astonished
and enthused, gave him a rousing acclamation.
Statesmen of Europe are not accustomed to
such perfect bilingualism. Dandurand knew
but the rudiments of the English language
when he was young, but he toiled incessantly
and perseveringly until he mastered it.
Dandurand was an indefatigable worker.
The tasks confided to him were numerous
and often difficult. He accepted them all
without complaint, and fulfilled them with
devotion, and, by reason of his great ability,
almost always with success.
France could not but recognize the ontstanding merit of the senator, and a few years
before the war he was named a member of
the great Institute of France-a very rare
and highly prized honour. To celebrate his
nomination a magnificent banquet was tendered to the senator in Paris, at which most
of the important men of France were present.
Our colleague made a ringing speech which
brought the guests to their feet, cheering
lustily. The senator had made an appeal
for the collaboration of France in an effort
to spread the highest possible French culture
in Canada.
That collaboration he obtained from the
French Governient, from the French clergy
through that most eminent prelate, Cardinal
Verdier, of Paris, and from the Collège Stanislas, one of the outstanding educational
institutions in France.
Shortly after his
return he also procured the substantial support
of the Government of the province of Quebec
and' the city of Outremont, and secured contributions from some of his friends, and himself made the most generous gift. The Collège
Stanislas of Canada is now almost ready for
occupancy. It is a beautiful and most modern
building. The professors are all fully licensed
educators; none better can be obtained from
France. The college is affiliated to the University of Paris. In a few months, a few weeks
perhaps, hundreds of students will begin to
benefit from the highest education bestowed
in France or probably anywhere in the world.
Since 1937 the senator has devoted himself
to this highly meritorious purpose. He conceived and built the college almost unaided.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN.

Such help as he obtained was due to his
untiring efforts. Higher education, he knew,
was the most precious gift he could leave to
his compatriots, and his legacy will for all
time serve his compatriots and bear witness
to his public-spiritedness; for Dandurand, was
a great patriot.
There is a side of the senator's life that is
little known, except to the many people whom
he helped. Demands for succour abounded.
Every apparently meritorious case he had
investigated by the branch managers of his
own bank, and if their report was satisfactory,
his instructions were to give the necessary help
and charge it to his account.
But, beside it all, the senator was a lovable
man. Of that I need say nothing in this
House, where he was so well known and so
highly esteemed. A week ago almost to the
hour, after giving the Senate explanations
respecting the treaties of commerce with
Argentina, Brazil and Chile, as the House
adjourned and he passed before a group of
his colleagues, he was singing gaily an old
love song of Quebec. Some of us were filled
with astonisbment. Here were youth, vigour,
undiminished interest in life, optimism always
dominant. Life was an adventure for him,
each new task another friend. Every day
the sun for him seemed to rise brighter and
his work to be more attractive. In fact the
last day of his life he rose feeling in perfect
spirits. He told me se, shortly after being
stricken. He never uttered a complaint, and
he died peacefully, almost in the midst of his
intensive work. Such a death he would have
wished.
The State funeral was most impressive, as
many here can bear witness.
The Prime
Minister was extremely kind to his colleague.
Without his efforts I doubt whether accommodation could have been found at the
hospital. Twice he visited the senator during
the day. He took a keen personal interest in
the funeral. All the members of this House
and the many other friends of the senator
will be deeply grateful te him.
I have one more word to add. It is of a
personal nature and for that I crave the
indulgence of the House. As a result of a
Canadian delegation to France in 1916, the
purpose of which was to develop commerce
between that country and our own, a trade
agreement was entered into by the Governments of both countries. It was resolved
that an exhibition train laden with French
goods should circulate through Canada, and a
similar train bearing Canadian products should
be sent around France. The French train
came to the Dominion in 1921 and was such

MARCH 17, 1942
a success, and evoked such unbounded
hospitality to the French mission, that the
Government of France prepared for the
coming of the Canadian train with great
pomp and éclat. I was in charge of the
Canadian train and repeatedly, but unsuccessfully, endeavoured to obtain the presence of
a Canadian Minister at the opening function.
Knowing the preparations made, I feared that
the apparent lack of support from my own
countrymen would dampen the enthusiasm of
our friends in France and jeopardize the
success of the venture. At the last minute I
received a message from Senator Dandurand
stating that he was on the way to attend the
inauguration.
His wife, to whom he was
extremely devoted, was gravely ill. Notwithstanding, he took the first steamer, attended
the function, gave it the prestige of his
Government and the zest of a wonderful
speech, spent three days perambulating with
the Canadian mission, and returned by the
very same steamer that had brought him to
France. I cannot say how grateful I felt to
him. The project I knew was sound, but it
required to be dedicated on French soil with
the full authority of the Canadian Government. Dandurand had faith in the venture,
at a time when others feared its failure and
prudently preferred to give it a wide berth.
The venture was a colossal success, and the
senator was rewarded for his courage and his
generous help.
But I know that he had extended to me a
helping hand at no small sacrifice to himself.
Similar kindnesses were no doubt extended to
others during his long life, and so a great
many people mourn him-as I do myself,
deeply and sincerely-from the bottom of
their hearts.
The knell of the senator's demise resounded
mournfully in high and distant spheres. His
Majesty the King gracefully, and of his own
volition, sent the following message to the
senator's family:
The King bas asked me to convey to you and
your family an expression of his deepest
sympathy in your sad bereavement.
The Governor General kindly expressed his
sympathy in these terms:
My wife and I are deeply shocked to hear
of the sudden death of your distinguished
father, whose loss will be mourned not only
by his many friends in Canada, but also throughout the British Empire. Will you please accept
our sincere condolences in your sad bereavement?
In the name of all Frenchmen who strenuously
uphohd the cause of the Allies, General Charles
de Gaulle cabled the following message:
In my name and in the name of the National
French Committee, please transmit to the Senate
of Canada the expression of our heartfelt condolences at the demise of Senator Dandurand.

95

He was a stout upholder of the Society of the
League of Nations, and one of the first
Presidents of that institution in which the
nations of the world had placed their hope.
As Frenchmen we cannot but be mindful of the
part played by Senator Dandurand in the
Committee of France-Amérique in preserving
and fortifying the historical bonds existing
between Canada and France. Fighting France
as well as Canada is more than ever imbued
with the sentiment of spiritual fraternity of
which Senator Dandurand was the symbol.
The senator died as he would have wished,
stricken in the full activity of life, with recorde
cumbering his desk, his agenda full, and his
mind already turned to the daily task. All
that is over. We on both sides of the House
will deeply regret his passing. His friends
will miss his advice and support, and the needy
hands stretched out in quest of help will remain
empty. From the turmoil of the multitude
amid which he lived so strenuously he has
gone to the cold darkness and eternal solitude and silence of the grave. Great citizen
of his country-I might almost say of the
world-he has well earned a rest in peace!
Hon. FELIX P. QUINN:
Honourable
members, may I be permitted to blend my
voice with those which already have been
raised in tribute to the memory of our departed
colleagues.
I did not become personally acquainted
with our late leader until I became a member
of this Chamber, but from that time on I found
him most considerate of recently appointed
members, and kindly, courteous and gentlemanly on all occasions. I tender to the Government, and to the late senator's family, my
sincere sympathy.
I knew the late Senator Rhodes for many
years, our acquaintance dating from the time
when he attended the law school of Dalhousie
University in Halifax. As his parliamentary
career has already been referred to, I need
not elaborate on that. I was his colleague in
the House of Commons, and I came with him
to this Chamber.
Mr. Rhodes was an outstanding athlete,
fond of outdoor life; an expert rugby footballer
and an ardent fisherman. These qualities
developed in him a strong body and aIso a
cheerful disposition. Shortly after his appointment to this Chamber he was stricken, as you
know, with a severe illness, and it was this
which deprived us of his sound advice and
excellent judgment. His affliction he bore with
the remarkable courage for which he was noted.
One of his outstanding characteristies was his
chivalrous courtesy to everybody. On behalf
of the people of Nova Scotia, whom he served
so faithfully, may I add my tribute to the
memory of the Honourable Edgar Nelson
Rhodes.

SENATE

Honourable
Hon. A. K. HUGESSEN:
senators, I cannot refrain on such an occasion
as this from adding a few words to what has
aiready been said so adequately and so
eloquently by the speakers who have preceded
me.
We are met here to-day under a great sense
of loss in the passing of the leader of this
House, a iloss which not only affects us in our
corporate capacity as one of the Houses of
Parliament, but which is very close to each one
of us individually; for whatever may be our
political sympathies, we feel, each one of us,
that we bave lost a personal friend-a friend
of rare charm, kindliness, and distinction.
Senator Dandurand met that test which is
perhaps the most acid test of all huiman
relationships: the more closely you became
acquainted with him the more did your
respect for him grow into admiration, and your
admiration into affection for the man himself
That, during the last five years, has been my
own experience, and I am sure it is an experience which has been common to all the
members of this Charnber.
We shall no longer see in our midst that well
known and distinguished figure in which the
experience of many years of devoted public
service combined with an abundant and overBlowing energy to direct the proceedings of
this House. We shall miss equally the kindly
smile, the courteous bearing, and every now
and again the flash of fire when controversial
topics came under discusion.
Truly it can be said of the leader whom we
have lest that he was, to use his own mother
tongue, un chevalier sans peur et sans
reproche.
Our loss is grievous indeed, and
for many of us, I am sure, this Chamber
will never seem to be quite the same again.
We mourn our loss, honourable senators, but
fortunately that is the only thing we have to
mourn. As for our leader himself, the end
came in just the way in which I am certain
he wouild have wished and hoped for it to
come-suddenly, like a thief in the night,
while he was still in the full enjoyment of his
faculties and standing at his post of duty.
We, his colleagues who knew him well, will
agrce that for him the long, slow descent, the
gradual decay of faculties and narrowing of
vistas, which is the lot of so many men as life
draws to its close, would have been an unbearable, intolerable burden. As it was, one might
almost say he met death with the same quick
step, the same resolute energy and the same
indomitable spirit which he showed throughout his life, and which was so familiar to
all of us here.
There is, too, another sense in which it can
be said that the passing 'of our leader was a
Hon. Mr. QUINN.

happy one. Of how many men in public life
has it been said that they have outlived their
usefulness? Of many statesmen it bas been
remarked, "If only he had dýied at the highest
point of his renown, history would, have been
kinder to his memory, because then it would
have been spared the record of the mistakes
and failures of his later years." It is inconceivable that anything of that kind could be
said of Senator Dandurand. He was, indeed,
at the very peak and summit of his career.
Look over the record of the last few imontls.
Only last autumn he received the honour of
appointment to the Imperial Privy Council;
in November he celebrated bis eightieth birthday; and less than two months ago, in that
touching and nemorable ceremony within
these four walls which we all so vividly
remember, his friends and admirers in and out
of this Chamber presented him with that
bust of himself, a replica of which now stands
in our own entrance hall as a fitting and permanent memorial of bis long and distinguished
service to this Parliament and this country.
And so I repeat, honourable senators, that
for our leader himself there is nothing to
regret. He died, as lie lived for so long, in
the enjoyment of the esteem of the country as
a whole, and of the regard and affection of
all who knew him; and he of whom that can
be said is indeed a fortunate man! Our regrets
are for ourselves, for our own loss of hîim
and for the grievous loss which Canada bas
sustained in being deprived of one of its most
experienced and valued statesmen. And it is
fitting that we should pay our last tribute to
his memory in this Chamber, which, for so
many years, was the scene of his labours and
bis triumphs.
Hon. W. A. BUCHANAN: Honourable
senators, I have been inspired to rise and say
something by an observation that was made
by the acting leader on the other side of this
House (Hon. Mr. Ballantyne) when he was
speaking of the late Senator Rhodes' entrance
into political life at an early age and drawing
to our attention the importance of encouraging young men to participate in the public
life of this country. It is true that Senator
Rhodes entered Parliament in his early
thirties. I recall also that our late leader,
Senator Dandurand, came to this Chamber
in his thirties. But the thought that was
running through my mind as I listened to
the tributes to both these men who served
our country with such distinction was of
an evening last fall I spent with our late
leader at bis home in Montreal.
He was
speaking about the school in which he took
a deep interest, and his concern in that conversation was about the future of the young

MARCH 17, 1942
people not only in his own province, but
throughout the whole of Canada. He spoke
of his desire that we should have a trained
youth, skilled to make a living and also
trained in the mind so as to be able to serve
Canada in the years to come. I was much
impressed by the views he expressed that
evening upon the training of our youth for the
future.
Most of us who live in Western Canada
are perhaps not as intimately acquainted as
we should be with other parts of the country,
particularly with the province of Quebec, but
I think men of the distinction of our late
leader, andi men like the late Ernest Lapointe
and others who have been associated with
our public life since Confederation, have done
more than any one else to bring about a
proper feeling between the two races in the
different parts of this country. Senator
Dandurand was a broad-minded man. I
looked upon him also as one of the hardestworking men whom I ever met in public life.
He worked hardi as the leader of the Senate,
in his capacity as a member of committees
of this House and in other public spheres.
But above all, he was a courteous, kindly
gentleman. iI like to think of him also as
being probably the most distinguished Canadian in the minds of many people in other
countries of the world, for he came to be
known throughout Europe and
South
America as an eminent, cultured and scholarly
representative of this country at the League
of Nations. Whenever I have had occasion
to meet men from foreign lands, one of the
first Canadian names to be mentioned in
the conversation bas always been that of
Senator Dandurand.
I should like also to say something about
the late Senator Rhodes, because I had
intimate relations with him during the time
I served in the House of Commons. I can
truly say that I learned to love- the man.
It was in my early days in the House of
Commons that he was Speaker, and he was
always a good friend to me. No Speaker
was more kindly and considerate than Edgar
Rhodes. He deserves ail the tributes that
have been paid to him. I doubt if in the
whole history of our parliamentary Chambers
anyone has filled the position of Speaker with
as great distinction as he did.
We are thinking to-day in terms of men
falling on battle-fields throughout the world.
I wonder if these two friends of ours did not
fall on the battle-field of public service. One
suffered an infliction that undoubtedly came
from service he rendered during a period of
great strain in the economic life of Canada;
and the other, our late distinguished leader,

served Canada devotedly until the last moment
of his life, always industrious, always willingly assuming the tasks that it was his duty
to perform as leader of this House.
Both our departed friends were splendid
examples to us here and to Canadian citizens
everywhere. If the youth of this country
can follow the careers of the late Senators
Dandurand and Rhodes, we need not fear for
the future of our parliamentary institutions.
Hon. J. W. deB. FARRIS: Honourable
senators, so much has already been said in the
Press and in and out of Parliament by way
of warm-hearted tribute to the late Senator
Dandurand, that almost anything I might add
now would be repetition; but I have within
me a feeling that I should like to say a word
about him, and that feeling is not vicariously
satisfied, although what bas been said already
has been said more authoritatively, perhaps,
and certainly better than I could say it.
Some honourable members who have spoken
here knew Senator Dandurand for a long time,
and intimately. That was not my privilege.
I did not know him until I came to the
Senate. On the night that I was introduced
in this House, and before the introduction
ceremony took place, the present acting leader
of this House (Hon. Mr. King) took me to
Senator Dandurand's room, where I was
received with that kindliness and courtesy
which were so characteristic of him. I think
Senator Dandurand at that time had a suspicion that I was one of those fire-eating
Westerners who needed a little guidance, and
with great tact he led the conversation around
to the Senate, to its functions and to its
atmosphere of non-partisan co-operation. That
made a lasting impression upon me. I hope it
was not entirely necessary.
Years have passed since then, and my
admiration and esteem for the late Senator
Dandurand and his great ability as a leader
have progressively grown. My personal liking
for him became stronger and stronger. It may
be a matter of comment on the qualities of
those of us who are British, but of all the
men in public life whom I have known and
who have passed away, those who have left
with me the strongest feeling of reverent affection have been two French Canadians-Sir
Wilfrid Laurier and Senator Dandurand. I
feel, as the honourable senator from Montarville (Hon. Mr. Beaubien) said a moment
ago, that this Chamber will not seem the same
again without Senator Dandurand.
The
Senate has always been associated in my
mind with his presence and his leadership.
lis presence will abide in this Chamber, but
his memory will extend far beyond these walls.

SENATE

It will follow us all the days of our lives,
and it will remain with the people of all
Canada. To-night, just a week after he spoke
here, we pay tribute to the former leader of
this House, a great Canadian.
I would say a word about the late Senator
Rhodes. He was a leader of men, a man of
great ability in public affairs. There is no
occasion for me to repeat at this time what
has been said here and elsewhere about his
public achievements. But I would speak to
you for a minute about Senator Rhodes as I
first knew him. We were students at Acadia
University, at Wolfville, Nova Scotia, and
attended classes together. We took part in
the mock parliament of that institution, on
opposite sides. We played football together.
He succeeded me as the captain of the Acadia
team. I was one of the select group who
on Saturday nights used to go down to his
rooms for a little poker game. I look back
on those college days and our associations with
feelings of emotion. After college our paths
separated. He was in the East and I was in
the West; so it was very rarely that I saw him
again, until I came to the Senate. Then
he was in his last illness. You know how be
bore that affliction bravely and with a smile.
For me it is liard to picture Ned Rhodes
except as strong and vigorous, and I recall
him as he was in our younger days. He was
a vital personality, be was popular, he was a
good friend and he was a good sportsman.
And, honourable senators, during the years he
continued to be a good sportsman and to play
the game. This country to-day mourns him
as a distinguished Canadian who has gone to
rest.
Hon. ATHANASE DAVID (Translation):
Your Honour and honourable senators, fifty
years of public life, forty-four of which were
spent within the precincts of this Senate, have
given our departed colleague the opportunity
to evince qualities of heart and mind which
were reflected in his words and deeds. He
was one of the men who had the best allround qualifications among those I have ever
known. As a lawyer, he published a law-book;
as a public man, he brought to his party the
help of his fluent and wise words; as the
representative of bis country abroad, he
placed Canada in the limelight.
Whether at Geneva, as President of the
League of Nations, or in France, as Canadian
delegate, he evidenced by his speeches the
inborn qualities of the race from which he
had sprung. Through bis urbanity, his courtesy,
his kindness, as well as his distinguished bearing and his engaging personality, he formed
everywhere lasting ties of friendship of which
Hon. Mr. FARRIS,

Canada reaped the benefit. In the business
world he stood out as a sbrewd administrator,
and many financial or banking institutions
were proud to number him among their
directors.
With a deeply human insight, he knew how
to discover those qualities which make us
esteem our fellow-men and overlook their
weaknesses.
His industry and energy were such that on
many occasions he accepted tasks which would
have discouraged many others.
Above all a Canadian, in spite of the great
admiration he had for France, he always firmly
believed, like his former leader and friend
Laurier, that national unity could be achieved.
Through his integrity, his sense of honour,
bis moderation and his broadmindedness he
won among our English-speaking friends an
esteem that redounded upon the province of
whieh he was one of the most distinguished
sons.
Death has called him, as he had always
hoped, in the full discharge of his duties. A
worthy end to a noble life! This House will
long keep, and draw inspiration from, the
memory of that statesman who served his
country so well-Raoul Dandurand.
Hon. C. B. HOWARD: Honourable senators, I could not let this occasion pass
without paying my tribute to our mutual
friend, Right Hon. Senator Dandurand, and
expressing my most sincere sympathy with
his family in their bereavement.
On behalf of the people of the Eastern
Townships of Quebee, I desire to express
their deep regret at the passing of the leader
of this House. I shall never forget the first
It was
time I met Senator Dandurand.
during the election of 1925. I had accepted
the Liberal candidature for the county of
Sherbrooke on the night before nomination.
As I was somewhat late in the field, there
were no outside speakers available.
But,
for me, Senator Dandurand
fortunately
came to Magog on a Wednesday night. At
my request, he accompanied me to Sherbrooke, and he was the only speaker in my
first campaign for a seat in the House of
Commons. He addressed an exceedingly large
meeting, and bis frank and genial manner, his
wonderful command of both languages, and
his pleasant personality endeared him to the
people in my section of the province.
Throughout the years he has left with me
the most pleasant memories, and during my
eighteen sessions as a Commoner was my
personal friend. A great Canadian without
an enemy, a credit to Canada in foreign
lands, a man on whom from time to time

MARCH 17, 1942
well-merited honours continued ta be bestowed, hie was always ready ta befriend the
mast humble citizen. Canada has lost an
honoured son, the Eastern Townships a great
friend, the Senate a wise leader, and society
a Christian gentleman.
1 wish ta join wjth those who have
preceded me in expressing ta every member
of his family my sincere sympathy.
(Translation) I bow ta the memory of this
great Canadian, the Rigbt Honourable Raoul
Dandurand.
Hon. L. M. GOUIN: Honaurable senators,
I think it also my duty ta pay a brief tribute
ta aur bonoured leader, whose passing we al
deeply regret.
Senator Dandurand was bath a great aristocrat and a great democrat. He was also a
distinguished statesman, an accomplished
diplomat and an agreeable and forceful
speaker.
H1e believed ardently in freedom. and justice
for ail. In particular, he displayed admirable
zeal for the sacred cause of educatian, whicb
hie firmly believed ta be the foundation of
true and sound democracy. The honourable
senator from Montarville (Hon. Mr. Beaubien)
bas referred ta, the founding of the Collège
Stanislas. Our lamented leader used ta say
that it was the last of aIl his works, but
probably.the best.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, bear.
Hon. Mr. GOUIN: The honaurable senatar
from Montarville bas been taa modest, for
from the very beginning bie was one of the
patrons of the Collège Stanislas. Other members of this House, including myself, have
been glad ta co-operate with aur leader in
this great educational undertaking. Our 250
pupils are now receiving the kind of instruction which Senator Dandurand wanted for
young Canadians of French origin. To al
those boys aur leader was really just like a
dear aid grandfather. In the new building of
the Collège Stanislas we shahl piausly place a
replica of the bust which naw adorns the
entrance hall of this Chamber. Wben those
pupils pass in front of it they will salute their
benefactor as we, too, shahl salute aur friend
when we pass before lis bronze bere, and
with the samne emation make this solemn
resolve: Leader, rest in peace. We will carry
on. Your work shahl not die with you. We
will continue your work as yau wanted it ta
be carried on, combining what is best of the
great cultures 'we have inherited from aur
two mother countries.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.

Hon. ARTHUYR MARCOTTE (Translation): Mr. Speaker, honourable members, if
1 arn allowed ta do so, 1 should like ta add
a few words ta the eloquent tributes paid ta,
the memory of the hanourable senators, particularly ta that of the Right Hon. Raaul
Dandurand.
From what 1 can see and have heard, it is
quite probable that of ail those present here
to-day I have enjoyed the Iongest acquaintance with the right honourable senator. I
was under the impression that the honourable
senator from Montarville had known him
before I did, but I was wrong. My acquaintance with the Right Hon. Senator Dandurand
dates from fifty years ago, which. shows that
I, too, arn growing aid and that I may jain
himi before long.
In any case, it was in 1891 >that 1 left
college ta study law in Montreal, and one
of the first persans who came ta my attention
there was a young lawyer named Dandurand,
who employed as bis clerk one of rny former
classmates. I myself served in the samne
capacity with Augé, Leclair and Chaffers.
Those of my generatian will recaîl the outbursts of violence that marked the campaign
of 1887 in Quebec. Corning after the Riel
affair and in the heyday of the Hon. Mr.
Mercier, these cantests were bitter in the
extreme. And again in 1892 it was the samne
story. My employer was engaged in the
struggle, and lawyer Dandurand was already
one of the Liberal party organizers. That is
bow I met bim. Those who admired here
his unfailing zest for if e, the youthful way
in which hie carried his years, would have
enjoyed seeing himn in action at the age of
twenty-eight or thirty. I was just startîng
out in polities at the time, and, besides
listening ta more experienced men, sometimes
addressed political rallies. For the first time
in my life I was conscious of baving met a
great man. However, we were victariaus and
My employer, Mr. Augé, was elected. Like al
iaw students, I used ta carry legal documents
from one office ta another, as was the customi
at the time. On one such trip ta his office,
Mr. Dandurand said this ta me: "My yaung
friend, do not forget ta congratulate your
employer, but beware-we shahl meet again!"
Meet again we did in 1897, and the Hon.
Senator Gouin knows something of this, for
it was bis father, Sir Lamer Gauin, wbo
defeated my employer that year.
And there you have a glimpse of the Right
Hon. Senator Dandurand's character: his
industry, his ceaseless activity, his perseverance and his will ta win. "You won this
election," hae wauld say, "but we shahl meet

100

SENATE

again!" That was his whole life. He met
with rebuffs at times, but he persevered until
the obstacle was surmounted. We have been
in a position te appreciate this here for quite
a number of years.
I shall not undertake to repeat the tributes
already paid him, but I should like to recali
a scene that occurred when I entered the
Senate. One of the first Liberals to welcome
me was that great and gentle man, the Hon.
Jacques Bureau. and standing at his side was
the Right Hon. Senator Dandurand, who
said: "I remember you wel." How thoughtful
of him to remember me. He could easily
have forgotten the young student I was at the
time, whereas I could not forget him who had
become such a leading figure in the country.
lie stands as an example to youth and to
those who, with enough youth left to serve
the wisdom of their years, wish to tread in
the footsteps of the regretted leader of this
House.
As for our honourable friend Senator
Rhodes, whom I knew for a good many years,
he fully justified the reputation which the
province of Nova Scotia bas come te acquire
for producing eminent men, always frankly
Canadian, always frankly British.
Hon. E. S. LITTLE: Honourable senators,
I cannot add te the eloquence of the tributes
which have been paid to our late right honourable leader, Senator Dandurand, and the
late Senator Rhodes, but I feel I should be
remiss did I net at this tirne acknowledge the
great honour which it has been my fortunate
lot te have Lad paid me by Senator
Dandurand almost since the first month of
my membership in this Chamber. It was my
good fortune te be chosen, along with Senator
Horsey, te represent the members on ýthis
side of the House in certain work which has
te be done in the carrying on of our duties
here, and from the very first I had the confidence of Senator Dandurand, whom I
learned te respect and te love.
Te me his loss is a very personal one, and
I wish te join with those who have preceded
me in paying tribute to him and extending
sympathy te his bereaved family.
With regard te Senator Rhodes, I have
known him fairly well ever since I came into
this House, for at the time I left thome te come
te Ottawa one of my political Nestors, who
had been in the House of Commons with
Senator Rhodes, said te me: "Little, you are
going te Ottawa, and I want you te look up
Ned Rhodes. Yeu will find in him, I think,
the finest gentleman who ever sat in the
louse of Commons." That, we all know, was
not at all wide of the mark, and I join with
his closer friends in mourning 'his loss to-night.
Hon. Mr. MARCOTTE.

Before I sit down may I draw the attention
of honourable senators te what were virtually
the last words uttered by our leader a week
ago to-night. He then said:
I would remind my honourable friends that
I am ceonstantly preoccupied in trying te learn
m due time what I can do in the interests of
the country.
In those words there is surely a lesson for
us all.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
PRIVATE BILL
SECOND

READING

Hon. Sir ALLEN AYLESWORTH moved
the second reading of Bill C, an Act to
change the name of The Saskatchewan Life
Insurance Company te Fidelity Life Assurance
Company.
He said: Honourable senators, I move that
this Bill be now read a second time. I make
this motion on behalf of the honourable
senator from East York (Hon. Mr. McGuire),
who is net able te be present to-night, but
who hopes to be here to-morrow. If this Bill
is given second reading to-night, I am prepared te move that it be referred te a
standing committee, before which the honourable 'senator fron East York will be able
te make any explanations of the Bill that are
necessary. The Bill is se simple in character
that perhaps it needs no explanation.
I have not had any communication with
the company interested, or with any representative of the company; se I am not able
te offer explanations te any greater extent
than anybody else who read the Bill. But
the whole purpose of the enactment is te
change the name of the Saskatchewan Insurance Company to the Fidelity Assurance
Company. And the Bill provides that all
rights and liabilities of the company are left
altogether unaffected by the change.
The motion was agreed te, and the Bill
was read the second time.
REFERRED TO COMMITTEE

The Hon. the SPEAKER: When shall this
Bill be read a third time?
Hon. Sir ALLEN AYLESWORTH: I move
that the Bill be referred te the Banking and
Commerce Committee.
An Hon. MEMBER:

No.

Hon. Mr. KING: I rather think, after what
the honourable gentleman (Hon. Sir Allen
Aylesworth) bas told us, that the House would
be inclined te give the Bill third reading now.

MARCH 17, 1942
Hon. Mr. LEGER: I arn not objecting to
this Bill, but I would warn the Senate that 1
believe, thougli 1 ar n ft
sure, that there is
already an insurance company of that namne.
It may be an Arnerican cornpany. The existence of two companies with the saine name
might cause confusion. ýIt would be just as
well for us to look into the question.
Hon. Mr. KING: I think it might 'be welI
that the Bill go to committee.
Hon. Mr. HARMER: The honourable gentleman frorn North York (Hon. Sir Allen
Aylesworth) thinks it should be referred to
the Committee on Miscellaneous Private
Bis.
The motion was agreed, ta, and the Bull
was referred to the Standing Committee on
Miscellaneous Private Bis.

Hon. Mu. BALLANTYNE.

MARCH 17, 1942
In July last he received the highest honour
at present in the right of Canadians to receive
-membership in His Majesty's Imperial Privy
Council.
My own relations with him were friendly.
I often met him in Ottawa and on the trains.
He was an engaging personality and a firstrate raconteur. Many times I have enjoyed
my conversations with him.
He was a vigorous champion of his own
opinions and of the aspirations of his compatriots.
His passing leaves a very distinct blank in
the Government of the country. I desire to
extend to rry right honourable friend and to
his followers my sincere expressions of sympathy
and regret.
Mr. M. J. COLDWELL (Rosetown-Biggar):
Mr. Speaker, we join in mourning to-day the
passing of one whose life was both useful and
full. That Senator Dandurand was what we
seldom see in our own Dominion-and what
we hope we may see more of in the years to
come-a Canadian statesman with an international outlook, was recognized not only in
our own country but in other countries of the
world. He received distinguished honours at
the hands of the people not only of Canada,
but of France, from whose culture he derived
so much inspiration. I shall always associate
the late Senator Dandurand with the noble
efforts that were made after the last great
war to secure world peace. He was faithful
to the ideals of collective security-sometimes
called a noble experiment which failed; but I
believe the day will yet come when upon the
foundations laid by him and others like him
will be erected a structure which will not fall
and will not fail.
I did not îcnow Senator Dandurand well,
but I often used to see him in the corridors,
and the picture which I shall carry in my mind
as long as I remain in these associations is of
a noble and friendly figure standing beside the
Throne in the Senate Chamber, and bringing
to my mind the words of Geoffrey Chaucer,
"He was a verray parfit gentil knight."
Mr. J. H. BLACKMORE (Lethbridge): Mr.
Speaker, naturally when one passes who has
filled for so many years so large a place in the
public eye as Senator Dandurand, the first
reaction is one of shoeck and regret. But I
believe that in the contemplation of this
man's life and of his passing most people will
feel that he bas been blessed in his going
hence as he had been in his living bere. He
has had a long, rich and abundant life, full of
activity, full of striving for the ideals which
guided him; a life crowned with a large
measure of success. I do not know how anyone
could ask of life anything finer. Now that
he has closed that life without pain, without
regret, I think there is cause for satisfaction
and comfort.
We join with those who will extend sympathy to the bereaved ones, for no matter how
far advanced one may be in years, when he
passes there will be an empty place at the
fireside and there will be hearts that are lonely
because he is no longer here. To these we
extend our sympathy and condolences.

Mr. THOMAS VIEN (Translation): Mr.
Speaker, I have the honour to represent the
electoral division of Outrement, where the
Government leader in the Senate resided. He
often did me the honour of calling me his
member. He -was the most illustrious of my
constituents.
The death of the Right Honourable Senator
Raoul Dandurand, a member of His Majesty's
Privy Council. Minister of State, dean of the
Senate and Government leader in the Upper
House, is mourned by all Canada and particularly by the province of Quebec. Over
eighty years of age and suffering for some
time from an illness which was undermining
his robust constitution, Mr. Dandurand could
have looked forward to the enjoyment of a wellearned rest.
In the face of the daily worsening situation,
following the example of Sir Wilfrid Laurier
and of the Right Hon. Ernest Lapointe. whose
valiant comrade in arms he had been, he
remained at his post and in the service of his
country to the very end.
In the late Senator Dandurand Canada bas
lost one of her.foremost statesmen; Quebec, an
illustrious son who was an honour to ber in all
circumstances and who had the signal privilege
of becoming President of the League of Nations;
the French Canadians, an able leader and
intrepid defender; the Liberal party, a wise
and courageous adviser; the members of the
Senate and of the House of Commona, a distinguished dean, a faithful friend, a great and
generous soul.
We who for the past quarter of a century
have been associated with him in the public
life of Canada will ever miss his noble presence
and eloquent voice.
There remains for us to imitate his virtues.
His career is a shining example of what can
be accomplished by us and for us French
Canadians, when native ability is supplemented
by personal effort, study, uprightness and the
conscientious performance of the given task.
May our young men learn from him to improve with age, never to let obstacles discourage
them, to develop their natural gifts by ceaseless
effort. to cherish high ideals and ever strive
to attain them. May they learn that, while
the lower rungs of the ladder are overcrowded
in every sphere, there is always room at the
top for men of ability.
May they take from him lessons of wisdom,
level-headedness and understanding; may they
imitate him in his unshakable faith in the
glorious destinies which Providence holds in
store for the Canadion nation.
Inspired by his noble example, let us stand
up to our daily tasks; let us strive to break
the bounds of mediocrity, and to shake ourselves free of mental sluggishness. We shall
then find stregth to endure all trials, to over.
come all obstacles, to persevere until final
victory.
Thus shall we honour, as he would wish us to,
the memory of this great Canadian.
BUSINESS OF THE SENATE
DISCUSSION
Hon. Mr. KING: Honourable senators, I
had hoped that we might have some business
to carry on with to-morrow, but I am informed
that there will be no work for us this week,

SENATE
and I would move that when the bouse
adjournis to-night it do stand adjourned until
eight o'clock on Tuesday next.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: Could the honourable the acting leader give us any information as to when we may expeet the bis in
reference to the price of wheat, the acreages,
and so on?
Hon. Mr. KING:
being made on these
and it is hoped that
week, when we may
dealing xvith themn in
I would move that

I think that progress is
bis in the other House,
tbey may reach us next
have an opportunity of
comrnittee.
the House adjourn.

Hon. Mr. HAIG: Honourable members, I
did not hear the motion put that when this
House adjourns it do stand adjourned until
Tuesday next.
Hon. Mr. ROBINSON:
motion.

That is the present

Hon. Mr. HAIG: The present motion is the
motion to adjourn. Before that there ought
to be a motion that when we adjourn the
bouse stand adjourned until Tuesdny.
I want to point out to the acting leader of
the House that if he will look at the report of
March il hie will flnd that the words iîttered
at that time are coming truc to the letter. I
do not want to say, "I told yeu so," but again
I say I think it is very unfair to keep members
from the outlying parts of Canada here for
one night's work when they couid have been at
home for ten days or two weeks. I may say
candidly that I do not think the wheat bis
will be here on Tuesday, Wednesday or
Thursday.
Hon. Mr. KING:

They may be.

bon. Mr. HAIG: You wiii be very lucky
if you have them here by the 5th of May, because the bouse of Commons adjourres on the
27th of March and the discussion of the bis
wili undoubtedly go ever Easter. There will
be money bis here before the adjournment,
no doubt. Are we sure that we shall adjourn
next Thursday or Friday night? Again I protest most bitteriy against holding this bouse
here for one sitting when it was clearly pointed
out in uinmistakable language that there was
no possibility of any legisiation reaching this
Chamber from the other bouse, if by 'legislation" one meant the wheat bis. There is not
a possibility of these bis reaching this bouse
witbin any reasonable time. The wheat question is one of the most contentious subjects that
havep come into our politics sinr'p the wbeat
markets of the world were closed to free trade
in wheat, and it will continue te be contenHon.

Mr. KING.

tious, not only until the war is over, but until
the markets of the world are free te trade
again.
The way in which we have been carrying
on is ail right for men who are wealthy and
can afford to sit here and let their business go
to pot; it is ail right for honourable senators
from the province of Quebec and the province
of Ontario-it is fine business for them; but
it is not fine business for those of us wbo come
from some other part of the country. I am
willing to give my services te this country, but
I am net willing to twiddle my thumbs for ten
days in order te serve one day. I think that
is an imposition on us who cerne from the far
parts of Canada. Some of you may net feel
as 1 do about this tbing. I feel very keenly
about it. In an endeavour to impreve tbings
I tried the gentie metbod and I tried the
urgent method, but I feund both were
failures. Now I arn geing te try some other
method.
I intend te protest against this
Hlouse being held in session for one day and
then being adjourned fer seven days. I will
protest against that every time it is proposed.
I may be a voice crying in the wilderness,
but I will most certainly cry. bonourable
senators, I protest against tbis motion.
I
think wvesheuld be hield right here in session
until next Thursday nigbt, and then we sheuld
adjourn until Monday night.
If there is
nothing for us te do, let us meet and adjouro.
In any exeat, we ougbt te be here and ready
if there should be any business. I suppose
that tbe Goverement leader will net be
appointed until the Government hias a chance
te reconsider the wbiole situation; I tbink it is
reasonable te expect that. The Government
bias lest two of its most distinguished leaders
fromn one of oui great provinces. It is a very
severe blew te the Prime Minister of this
country te lose these men, on whom hie leaned
for advice and guidance, especiaily as to
public opinion in that great province. That is
sornething that maybe ail do net understýand,
but I can understand it. bowever, that deoes
net justify our adjourning to-night, after
this one sitting, and being turned leose again
on the city of Ottawa,-or wherever we happen
te be, until next Tuesday nighit. That is net
fair te the city of Ottawa and it certainly is
net fair te us.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: Henourable senators, might 1 suggest te the acting leader that
in the interim he try te get some clear idea as
te when the wbeat buis are likely te reach
this House? If they are net likely te came
for a week or more, as the honourable senator
frorn Winnipeýg South-Centre (bon. Mr. Haig)
bias suggested, then benourable members could
be notified. I think it might be better if the

MARCH 17, 1942

adjournment were for a longer period than
until next Tuesday, and should the wheat bills
be ready to be sent to us before the date set
for our resumption, His Honour the Speaker
could call us together, under the authority
given to him at the beginning of the session.
I do not know whether that would meet with
the views of the honourable senator from
Winnipeg South-Centre.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: We have to meet next
week to pass supplementary supply, not only
for current account, but also for the war
estimates. Both these items must be passed
by us and assented to before the 27th.
Hon. Mr. KING: I think my honourable
friend is quite right. It was suggested that
we might adjourn until to-morrow aftern-oon.
But we have nothing on our Order Paper and
there is no reason why we should meet
to-morrow just to adjourn again. My honourable friend from Winnipeg South-Centre
(Hon. Mr. Haig) suggests we may not have
these agricultural bills over here before the
27th. He may know more than I, and more
than the Government. It depends on the
attitude of the House of Commons when they
will come to us.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: The Opposition in that
House.
Hon. Mr. KING: Yes. But I do know this,
that there are certain financial measures which
should be passed next week, before the Easter
vacation. It is at least hoped that they will
be ready for us some time next week, and
that -is why I am suggesting that when the
House adjourns to-night it stand adjourned
until next Tuesday night.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: I am perfectly
agreeable to that.
The motion was agreed to.
The Senate adjourned until Tuesday, March
24, at 8 p.m.

The Hon. the SPEAKER: When shall this

Bill be read a second time?
Hon. Mr. KING: With leave of the Senate,
at the next sitting.
WAR APPROPRIATION (UNITED
KINGDOM FINANCING)
BILL
FIRST READING

A message was received from the House of
Commons with Bill 15, an Act for granting
to His Majesty aid for the purpose of
financing United Kingdom war requirements
in Canada and for national defence and
security.
The Bill was read the first time.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: When shall this
Bill be read a second time?
Hon. Mr. KING: Honourable members, as
this measure is different from the usual
financial bills that come to us from the other
House, may I suggest that the resolution
which preceded it, and which was moved by
the honourable Minister of Finance on the
18th instant, be incorporated in our Hansard.
I would suggest also that we proceed with
second reading of this measure to-morrow,
so that honourable senators may then have
an opportunity to express their views upon it.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: Honourable
senators, I do not think any objection can
be taken to the resolution presented in
another place being included in the report
of our debates, especially in view of the fact
that it contains much informative detail. In
regard to second reading of this Bill, I
understand that with the consent of the
Senate it can be taken to-morrow.
Hon. Mr. KING: Yes, to-morrow.

The Hon. the SPEAKER: Is it the pleasure
of honourable senators to adopt the suggestion just made?

PRIVATE BILL
REPORT OF COMMITTEE

Hon. C. E. TANNER presented the report
of the Standing Committee on Miscellaneous
Private Bills on Bill B, an Act ta incorporate
the Canadian Dental Association.
He said: The committee is reporting the
Bill without any amendments.
I might
explain there was some discussion on the
motion for second reading of this Bill, and

MARCH 25, 1942
it was suggested that th'e dental associations
of the provinces should be consulted on the
incorporation. It appears that this association has been carrying on for many years,
that it is an educational rather than an
administrative body, and that it has been in
close collaboration with ail the dental associations of the provinces. Correspondence produced before the committee indicated that
every dental association in Canada is very
much in favour of this proposed incorporation.
THIRD READING

The Hon. the SPEAKER: When shaîl this
Bill be read a third time?
Hon. Mr. COTE: With leave of the Senate,
in order ta expedite the Bill being sent ta
the other bouse, I move that it be now read
a third time.
The motion was agreed ta, and the Bill was
read the third time, and passed.

arrived at this decision on the ground that
the passage of the said Bill would flot be in
the public interest.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: When shahl this

Hon. Mr. TANNER: At the next sitting of
the House.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Has the motion been put,
Mr. Speaker?
The Hon. the SPEAKER: Next sitting of
the House.
Hon. Mr. CALDER:- May I rise just ta
make an inquiry rather than ta speak ta the
Bill? This is a measure that affects a company
in my own province. It bas been intimated
ta me, whether correctly or otherwise I do flot
know, that in the consideration of the Bill the
committee bad the benefit of the presence af
the Superintendent of Insurance, and that he
said he could see no objection at ahI ta
changing the name of the company as proposed. We ail know Mr. Finlayson, and we
ail have the very highest regard for him.
lie has proven himself a very strong administrator of the Insurance Act. From my
44567-8 j

lui

knowledge of Mr. Finlayson I should judge
that when he states something he means
exactly what he says. In these circumstances
I cannot understand why the committee
thought best not, to allow this company ta
change its name, and I should certainly like
to have some further explanation from members of the committee before a vote is taken
on this question.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Next sitting of the
House.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: Consideration at
the next sitting of the House.
WHEAT ACREAGE REDUCTION BILL
FIRST READING

A message was received fromn the Huse of
Commons with Bill 12, an Act respecting
wheat acreage reduction.
The Bill was read the first time.
SECOND READING POSTPONED

The Hon. the SPEAKER: For what date
shall this Bill be placed on the Order Paper
ta be read the second time?
Hon. Mr. KING: Honourable senators,
this is one of three buis relating to Western
farming conditions. I arn going ta ask consent
of the Senate ta have the motion for second
reading made to-morrow.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: As the honourable acting leader (Hon. Mr. King) knows, it
might be well ta take second reading this
afternoon, if the Senate is agreeable. Then
this measure could be referred with the other
wheat bis, if they are given second reading,
ta the appropriate committee.
Hon. Mr. KING: 1 appreciate that suggestion very much. If second reading could be
given this afternoon, it would be well, for I
know the Government is desirous of advancing
the measure. As my honourable friend suggests, after second reading is given, the Bill
could be referred ta a committee-to the
Committee on Agriculture.

PRAIRIE FARM ASSISTANCE
MOTION

FOR SECOND

BILL

READING

On the Order:
Second reading of Bill 14, an Act to amend
the Prairie Farm Assistance Act, 1939.-Hon.
1%1.King.
Hon. Mr. KING: Honourable senators, I
would ask that the honourable senator from
Peel (Hon. Mr. Marshall) move the second
reading of this Bill.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Is that Bill before
us?
Hon. DUNCAN MeL. MARSHALL: This
is an amending Bill of only one clause. Under
the Act no year can be declared an emergency

109

year unless wheat is less than 80 cents a
bushel. The probabilities are that the price
will be raised 10 cents above that level, and
so the amending clause provides:
The Governor in Council may. for the purposes of this Act, declare any crop year to be
an emergency year.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: Would the
honaurable senator bhe good enough at this
point to inform us ixnder what conditions the
Goveinor in Council would feel justified in
declaring any crop year to be an emergency
year?
Hon. Mr. MARSHALL: The Act pravides
that when there is a bad crop in a certain
territory the Governor in Council can declare
the crop year ta be an emergency year, and
assist the farmers under the Prairie Farm
Assistance Act. This Bill makes but one
change. It provides that the Governor in
C'ouncil may, if he considers there has been
virtually no crop in a certain district, declare
the crop year as ta that district ta be an
emergency year, even though wheat is over
80 cents a bushel, and may praceed along the
lines laid down in the Act, which, I helieve,
was passed last session.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: Wide open.
Han. Mr. MARSHALL: No. The Act defines crop failures and lays down the conditions
under which evidence is taken froan municipalities as ta crap failures, and the manner in
which applications for assistance ta farmers
are ta be dealt with. The purpose af the Farm
Assistance Act is simply ta help the farmer
live through the year after he bias had a crop
failure. As we know, same farma of national
insurance was suggested, but the decision af
the Privy Council discouraged any action alang
that line. For the last two years the Government hias, under the Prairie Farma Assistance
Act, been assisting farmers in those districts
where crop failures have been declared.
Hon. C. P. BEAUBIEN: The amendment
apparently leaves it entirely ta the discretion
of the Government. Is that discretion limnited
by tihe statute?
Hon. Mr. MARSHALL: The Government
had that discretion before, but if wheat was
80 cents a bushel, or 10 cents above the fixed
price, it was thought it would not be neceesary
ta declare any crop year an emergency year.
Now, as it costs more ta raise, wheat, the other
Bouse lias passed a Bill increasing the price
ta 90 cents, and cansequently under the Act
no assistance could be given ta the prairie
farmer at aIl. This amendment removes the
80-cent block, s0 ta speak, and allows the
Government ta proceed under the Act in any

Hon. Mr, MARSHALL:

Hon. Mr. BALLANTY'NE: Ail I desiro to
say about Bill No. 14 is that the proposed
statutory change, which Icaves it entirely to the
Minister or the Governor in Council to dotermine when and where an emergency exists, is
a most extraordinary one. I shouid have
thought the Government would be very carefui to place restrictions around such a proposai, and to iirovide that such and such must
be donc before it, wouid act. If I understand
the honourabie senator corrcctly, he says that
this matter is ieft entirciv to the Gox ernor in
Council.
Hon. Mr. MARSHALL: No. Under the
Act the Governor in Council could proclairn
any year an emergency year, provided the
price of wheat was below eighty cents. The
oniy thing this Bill dees is te enable the
Government te take the roof off that price
in dceignating an ernergency year.
The Act now on the Statute Book which
wýe passed two years ago, I think, provides
for the appointment of a Board of Review to
examine the applications made for this
assistance through the municipalities, and ta
report as te what shouid be done in the
different districts. The Executive Council, in
deciding whethcr an emergency exists or net,
acts upen the information gathered from the
municipal officers and the Board of Review as
f0 crop conditions.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Honaurabie senators, copies of Bill 14 are net yet before us,

the necessify for this Bill is predicated entirely
upon a bill, yef te cerne f.rorn the other House,

PRAIRIE FARM ASSISTANCE BILL
MOTION

FOR SECOND

READING

Hon. Mr. KING: Honourable senators, I
should like to return to the order which we were
discussing a few moments ago, for the second
reading of the Prairie Farm Assistance Bill.
My honourable friend fromn Parkdale (Hon.
Mr. Murdock) is quite right ini saying that
this Bill is based on one which has not yet
been received in the Senate. Nevertheless,
this Bill is properly before the House. It was
introduced last night, and it is quite proper
that it should now corne before us fur second
reading, though I do not wish to, press it if
there is any objection. True, the price increase
provided for in the other Bill has mnade this
amending Bill necessary, and I tbink t5he honourable senator is quite right in saying that
the other Bill should also be before the
House.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: This Bull is not on
the file.
THon. Mr. KING: I do flot k!no'w. The Bull
came over last night andL got first reading.
It should be on our file to-day. The order is

1

on the Order Paper, but, as I say, 1 h~ave no
desire to urge for the second reading to be
given now. We can let it stand.
Hon. A. L. BEAUBIEN: No Bill on the
file?
Hon. Mr. KING: If there is any exception
taken to the second reading, we will let the
order stand.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: There bas been
exception. I take very strong exception to it.
Hon. Mr. KING: The honourable gentleman insists?
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Yes.
Hon. Mr. KING: The *Bill could receive
second reading 110W, but I will not press it.
Hon. Mr. M-acARIHUR: What is the nurn*ber of the Bill?
Hon. Mr. KING: Bill No. 14.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: It is flot on the file.
Hon. Mr. MARSHALL: The other Bill is
coming. Is it flot in order to move tbe
second reading of this Bill?
An Hon. SENATOR: Yes.
Hon. Mr. MARSHALL: Then I so move.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: It is rnoved *by
Hon. Senator Marshall, se-conded by Hon.
Senator Stevenson, that Bill 14, an Act to
amend the Prairie Fýarm Assistance Act, 1939,
be now read a second time.
Hon.
Mr.
MURDOÇK:
Honourable
senatorsHon. Mr. KING: Just a moment, please.
The statement that the Bill is not on our files
has been confirmed; so the Bill is net properly
before us.
Hon. A. L. BEAUBIEN: It is on my file.
Hon. Mr. KING: I arn ad-vised by the
pages that it has flot been dîstributed. If it

Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: I do flot like to
jnterrupt rny honourable friend, but the
second reading bas not yet been moved.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: I have tried three
times to rise to a point of order. I distinctly
object to this attempt at a hurried consideratien of a Bill that is predicated entirely on
the passage of another bill in another place,
when that bill is flot before us at ail and the
one to wvhich it is suggested we should now
give second reading is not on our files.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. KING: I think, the objection of
the honourable senator frorn Parkdnle (Hon.
Mr. Murdouk) is wcll taken. If the Bill is
nlot on our- files here, we should not proceed
with second reading.
Sorne lon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCE: Stand.
Hon. Mr. KING: Stand.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: Then I understand that as Bill 14 has not been distributed
to honourable senators, the motion for second
reading must stand for the present.
The motion stands.
WAR APPROPRIATION (UNITED
KINGDOM FINANCING) BILL
SECOND READING

On the Order:
Second reading of Bill 15, an Act for granting to lus Majesty aid for the purpose of
fiuîaîneîg United Kingdoni wor requirernents in
Canada and for national defence and security.
Hon. Mr. KING: Ilonourable senators, this
Bill lias been in rny hands for somne time and
I hope it is on honourable senators' files. I
have asked the honourable sonator from
Vancouver South (Hon. Mr. Farris) to move
second rcading.
Hon. J. W. deB. FARRIS: Honourable
senators, I mox o the second reading of this
Bill. The Bill lias been printed and I think
wc ail have it bcfore uis. It is a measure that
I arn sure every honourable member of the
ouse lias alreaaly consitlored. lFor puIposOs
of explanation. it rnay he divided into two
parts: one contains provisions for rofinancing
obligations already incurred by Great Britain
in connection with war materials and foodstuifs; and the other part, which is in relation
to the future, proposes a gift of a billion
dollars' worth of goods as the British Government may re-quire them.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN.

I shaîl briefly explain the provisions of
sections 4 and 5, relating to the reflnancing of
past obligations. May I say, in connection
with this, that we nowv deal with billions as
we used to deal with millions. The change of
one letter in this word "million" involves an
increase to one thousand million dollars,
which in normal times would seem to be a
sornew bat large incerease.
Canada's war
expenditures are of a two-fold nature, and it
is necessary to keep that in mind in considering the provisions of this Bill. First there
are wbat are known as direct expenditures,
rnade for the production and use of our own
materials for our own war purposes and in
connection with our own war effort. 1 say "our
own" there as distinguished from those of
our Allies.
The second kind of Canadian
expenditures is indirect; and those in relation
to Gdreat j3ritain and other Allied countries
corne under that heading. The direct expenditurcs made last year have not yet been
entirely hefore this Ibouse. I heliex e there is
f0 ho n supplementary vote in that connection,
and wvhen the total amount bas bcen votedit Pas already heen expended-it will arnount
to $1,430,000,000.
The indirect expcnditures are whbat I amn
talking about for the moment. In this conoction there is this important fact to ho kept in
nd, that when another country purchases
froin us goods of any nature there are just a
limîited somuber of w ays in which they (an
ho paid for. Tbey may bc paid for hy gold.
w'bicbi is the normal method of payment wlion
it is possible. They rnay ho paid for by the
cancellation of debts wbicli Canada may owe
to that country. This rnethod rnay ho termed,
and bas heen terme(l in the other House,
repatriation of our clehts. In the third place,
they may ho paid for hy tPe exebiange of
other gonds and other services. which of
course is limitecl to the extent of our willingness to acccpt gonds and services frorn other
countries. The only other rncthod cf settlement is. to put it rather awkwardly, for the
purchasing country ot to pay for tPe gonds
at ill, but sirnply to ow e the debt and lot it
stand, with or without interest.
Bcaring thiat in mi, I caîl attention of the
Hlous.e to this fact, that since the war started
tho total net deficit on the arnount purchased
in Canada hy the sterling area has been
$1,770,000,000. I take that expression "sterling
%ieat" frorn the Minister of Finance. The
sterling area includes Great Britain and some
other countries which tise the pound sterling;
but prirnarily and for our purpose of thinking
if is largcly the United Kingdorn, Great Britain
and Northern Ireland. This sum-I do not
know whether Ponourable senators can take in

MARCH 25, 1942
these tremendous figures at one thought-is
the total net deficit, up to February of this
year, on the indirect expenditure of Canada;
for it is indirect expenditure when we are not
That has been financed in
paid back.
accordance with the outline I have just given.
Of that amount Great Britain paid some

$250,000,000 in gold, all her gold' payments

having been made prior to December, 1940,
considerably over a year ago. There has been
no payment in gold of any portion of this
tremendous suin of money to Canada since
that time. Of the balance, $400,000,000 has
been paid by repatriation of obligations of
ours in government or railway bonds or
debentures in Great Britain, securities which
had not matured, but were paid or cancelled
prior to maturity. That leaves a balance of
about one billion dollars that has not been
paid to Canada for good's already purchased
and received in connection with this war. That
is now an accumulation of sterling balances
in London. So honourable senators will see
from the statement up to date that except
for the $250,000,000 in gold paid prior to
December, 1940, the entire balance of this
$1,770,000,000 lias been financed by Canada,
and one billion dollars of that is simply an
accumulation of sterling owed to Canada in
London by the British Government.
I do not intend to refer to the details of
sections 4 and 5, for two reasons. They do not
affect the principle of the Bill; and, secondly,
the details of how these things are worked out
being strictly technical, I think that no one
other than technical advisers of the Department of Finance should undertake an explanation of them. It is provided by sections 4 and 5
that of the one billion dollars now standing
as a debt to us in sterling, $700,000,000 is to be
converted from a sterling obligation to an
obligation in Canadian dollars. I call honourable senators' attention to the fact that that
obligation for $700,000,000 is to remain in that
form without any interest to be paid by the
British Government during the rest of the
war period, on the understanding that at the
termination of the war adjustments will be
made, not with regard to the past, but as to
the future and the rate of interest then to be
paid. That is all I need to say about sections
4 and 5.
The other provision of this Bill, and one
that has been more in the minds of the public
generally, relates to the so-called gift of one
billion dollars. That has to be kept entirely
separate from these past financial transactions
about which I have been speaking. This
part of the Bill provides for the payment for
food-stuffs and munitions as they will be
required by the British Government, to the

113

extent of one billion dollars. As I have
already commented, the extent of the increase
in expenditures is indicated by our now
speaking of a billion dollars as we used
formerly to speak of a million dollars. I would
emphasize that by pointing out that this one
contribution is double the total expenditure of
Canada in any one year prior to the war.
Hon. Mr. HOWARD: For all purposes.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: Yes, for all purposes.
I think it is unfortunate that from time to
time the expression "gift of one billion
Somebody might
dollars" has appeared.
say: "That is a strange thing to do. Canada
is a new country, not financially a rich
country. Great Britain possesses the accumulated wealth of generations. It is a
strange thing for Canada to make a contribution of cash to Great Britain." The thing
to be kept in mind is the fact that this is
in reality nothing more or less than a contribution of food-stuffs grown in Canada and
shipped to Great Britain, of munitions manufactured in Canada and shipped to Great
Britain, of aeroplanes, of tanks and of anything else which we can produce here and
ship to that country.
Hon. Mr. MacLENNAN: Britain will not
be called upon to pay for those.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: No. What it means
is that the gift consists of these things. If
you wanted, to give a man a new suit of
clothes, you could do it in one of two ways.
You could either hand him over a suit you
already have or that you might purchase
specially for him, or give him a cheque and
tell him to make the purchase himself. But
in either case, if the money is ear-marked
for that particular purpose, the thing in
substance is not the gift of money, but the
contribution of the goods. That I would
emphasize in this connection.
This Bill has a preamble, a long Whereas
clause. I am not disputing in any way the
correctness of that preamble, but for the
purposes of my explanation of the Bill I
have written out what I think is a simpler
statement of exactly what we are proposing
to do by the Bill. It is this:
Whereas Canada in common with her sister
members of the British Commonwealth of
Nations and in common with the other Allied
nations is at war with Germany, Japan and
other countries; and whereas the safety of
Canada, her freedom and her national

SENATE

necessary for our success and in order to
make effective our Allied strategy in an
offensive programme to defeat and destroy
our enemies: therefore this legislation is
enacted for the purpose of providing foodstuffs, munitions and war supplies to be
made available to Great Britain in aid of
our common cause and in furtherance of our
united war efforts. It is one step in the
march to victory.
To summarize. Before the United States,
our ally, was as closely identified with us in
the war as she is to-day, there were some
people in that country who, for the ýpurpose
of stirring up misunderstanding, had suggested that Canada's war effort was not as
genuine as we claimed it to be, that it was in
fact nothing but a policy of "cash on the
barrel-head."
When I recall to honourable
senators that in the past year the direct contribution of this country was S1,400,000,000,
and the indirect contribution already mentioned was $1,700,000,000, a very large portion
of which was expended in one year, and that
for his year there will be, in addition t tihis
S1,000,000,000 contribution e are now making,
another vote of Parliament for a further
$2,000000000, or a total in cash to be taken
this year from the Canadian treasury, in
furtherance of our war effort, of $3,000,000,000three thousand million dollars-there can be
no suggestion that any cash-on-thce-barrelhead policy is governing the war effort of this
country.
Honourable senators, may I conclude with
this thought. W Thatever our cash contribution may be, the contribution of Canada
towards winning this war cannot be measured
by that alone.
Soce Hon. SENATORS: Hear, bear.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: It must be measured
by our ships and the sailors on our ships who
sail under and over the oceans; it must be
neasured by our planes and the pilots of our
planes who soar 'the skies in our defence and
in defence of our Allies; it imust be measured
in terms of our armed forces who stand guard
on every front and are prepared to fight the
enemy wherever duty shall demand; lastly,
it must be measured by the spirit of the Canadian people, which finds expression in their
determination to do all and to give all until
the foe is beaten and victory is ours.
Hon. C. C. BALLANTYNE: Honourable
senators, I am sure I am speaking for everyone
in this Chamber when I say how much we
appreciate the lucid manner in which the bonourable senator from Vancouver South (Hon.
Mr. Farris) has explained our financial relations with the Mother Country. May I add
Hon. Mr. FARRIS.

that I hope the changes he has made in the
preamble of the Bill wil be adopted, for certainly they are a great improvement on the
present drafting.
I heartily agree with the loyal and patriotie
sentiments so eloquently expressed by my
honourable friend. I would add one or two
measurements to those he bas already so
wisely mentioned. We can never estimate
the sacrifice of the 46,000 men, women and
children crushed by enemy bombs in the
United Kingdom, and of those persons, about
equal in number, maimed probably for life.
This measure most certainly will be approved
net only by the Parliament, but by the people
of Canada, and I think the Government are
to be heartily commended for what they have
done in a financial way. I am sure that Great
Britain and our Allies appreciate it to the
full. But we cannot compare any contribution Ihat this country may make in pounds,
shillings and pence, or dollars, to the sacrifices
in blood and treasure by Great Britain,
especially through 1939 and 1940, when she
stood alone; and even now, when she is aided
by gallant Allies, too much credit cannot be
given to ber.
I am delighted to know that this billiondollar gift is to be made to Great Britain.
It is not altogether a gift, for, as the honourable senator from Vancouver has so aptly
pointed out, this billion dollars is to be spent
in Canada not only for munitions and implements of war, but also for food-stuffs, and it
will be of benefit generally to our people.
Therefore it is with the greatest pleasure and
vith full-hearted appreciation that I agree
thoroughly with the purpose of this measure.
Hon. A. MARCOTTE: Honourable members, if I rise to make a few observations on
the present measure, it is not with the idea
of opposing its principle, for I faveur the
decision to grant England all possible help.
There are sone who say that they would have
favoured the postponement of such a gift,
because they thînk it is premature. We are in
this war until final victory, but we do not
know how long the war will last, nor how
much it is going to cost Canada. We could in
the meantime supply the goods and munitions
required and place the cost on the credit side,
either as loan or advance. When the war is
over and adjustment is made, it would be easy
to decide what discount Canada would grant
England. We should take into consideration
the difference between the financial standing
of the two countries. England has a tremendous power of financial recuperation, while
Canada, a vast country with a small population, will take many years to come back to
normal financially.

MARCH 25, 1942

This is a matter af opinion as ta the time
of making the gif t, nat as ta the gif t iteif.
The giving ta England of thîs maney in the
farm af supplies free af charge is samething
that should appeal ta everyone in this honourabie Chamber. I am one af those wha th'ink
that we awe England mare than, money when
we weigh what we have received fram lier.
1 refer ta aur British institutians and to the
liherties we have heen, and are, enjoying
under the British flag. It seems ta me necessary at tbi.s time ta bring back ta the memory
of our people some historical trutis easily forgatten in the turmail af present cantroversies.
Although we bave been at war for ncarly
three years, and have witnesscd the terrible
fate ai nations wanting peace and peace only,
still some ai aur peaple are saying that this is
England's war and that it is nane of aur
business. 1 always hear that with sarraw
and pity: with sarrow, because it proves the
ignorance of these people; with pity, because
they are ta be lorgiven as nat knowing any
better. And this ignorance is not their fault.
Their education is nat ai their mnaking- it is
given ta .them and it is faulty.
Over a year aga, wbile addressing members
of a Mantreal club and referring ta same
proposcd educational refarms in the province
ai Quebec then being discussed, I said:
Should we nat remember there is flot a
country in the world enjoying a measure af
liberty greater than that which we enjoy in
this province af Quebec? It seems ta me the
truth might well be inculcated that it is only
under the British regime that canquered peoples
may nat anly aspire ta liberty, but became
sister nations of their conquerars. We wha are
descended f ram one heroic race could without
hesitation proclaim ourselves proud ta be the
partners ai another race which in these terrible
days gives an example ai heroism comparable
ta anything knowni in histary.
Are we really appreciating the full value af
the liberties enioyed ýunder aur British institutions? In order ta give mare weight ta my
argument, allow me ta refer ta an address
dciivered sixty-five years ago by a man
dcstined ta become one af the greatest Prime
Ministers af this country. I refer ta Wilfrid
Laurier. Mis address attracted cansiderable
attention at the .time, but I tbink the excerpts
1 am about ta, read apply with even greater
is entitled,
The address
force to-day.
"Libéralisme Politique," and was delivered on
the 26t-h ai June, 1877, in the city of Quebee.
The present translation in English is my own.
Na daubt it could be improved, but it is
essentially correct.
Laurier stated at page il:
Effectually, we French Canadians are a conquered race. It is a truth sad ta state, but,
after ail, it is the truth.

With respect, but very firmly, 1 disagree
with that statement; I think it is flot correct.
It is true that our country was canquered, but
we as a race were flot conquered. By the
Treaty af Paris of 1763 this country ceased
to ,hp French; it became English. later British,
and to-day it is the Dominion of Canada,
one af the links of the British Commonwealth
of Nations. That we became English and
later British subjects was possible only under
British institutions and under the British
flag. But as a race we did flot change. We
were given the right and the means to remain
af the French race, cnjoyiog our faith, our
language, our laws. We have been free to
continue our traditions, to develop our culture, to educate our children as before.
Though of the French race, we were English
subjets, and happy sa to remain: so much Sa,
in fact, that we resisted the cajoleries of
French cnvýoys who in 1776 wanted us to
Join the English colonies then rebelling
against England. Then we fought to keep
the English flag flying over Canada, and, as
you ail know, we did so again in 1812. Our
loyaýlty was evoked by our freedom under
British institutions-by the enlightened British
system of ruling vanýquished countries.
And if in the intervening years we 'have not
changed as a race, is it to be deplored? We
have csnly to remeurber the visit of Their
Majesties, the entreaties of the King and the
Queen for us to remain what we are, to continue our French traditions, ta devel-op aur
own culture.
In the present war, with unfortuna-te
France prostrate under the German heel, did
not aur Governor General and our Prime
Minister appeal to us to save French culture
and French traditions, ta remain the last post
of French civilization?
Laurier cantinued:
But if we are a conquered race, we alsa have
made a conquest: the conquest of liberty. We
are a free people; we are a minority, but al
aur rights, ail aur privileges are preserved ta
us. And what is the source af that liberty?
It is the constitution which has been conquered
for us by aur f athers and which we are enjaying
ta-day. . . . We have no more rights, no mare
privileges, but we have as many rights, as many
privileges as have the ather populations which
compose the Canadian family.
And here in Laurier's view is the reason
for our inability ta grasp the real meaning of
British institutions. Wrhat 'he said was truc
then and it is truc ta-day.
Our French educatian naturaliy trains us ta
study the history of madern liberty, nat in the
classical land of liberty, nat in the histary af
England, but among the peaples ai the European
continent, the peoples of the same origin and

SENATE

Il fi

religion as our own. And there, unfortunately,
the history of liberty la written in bloody type,
in the snost sorrowful pages whicbi are contained in the liistory of the human race.
And further Laurier says:
I quite admit that liberty as generally understood and practîsed iii France has notbing
seductive in it. The French lhad had the naine
of liberty and flot liberty itscîf.
The better to illustrate bis ideas, Laurier
cites verses from a Frenchi poat, Auguste
Barbier, eeomparing liberty to a woman:
A la voix rauque, aux durs appas,
Qui, (lu brun sur la peau, du feu dans les
prunelles,
Agile et marchant à. grands pas,
Se plaît, aux cris du peuple, aux sanglantes
lu1 mles,

Auxê longs roulements des tambours,
A l'odeur <le la pendre, aux lointaines volees

Qui ne prend ses amours qjue dans la populace,
Qui ne prête son large flanc
Qu'à (les gens forts comme elle, et qui veut
qn'011 l'embrasse
Avc dles bras rouges de sang.
And Laurier liera uses Tennyson's limes to
dcscrUc England as tbe land of liberty:
It is the land tlîat frceinî

'I'at sober suited 1"rcedoni chose,
The land, whlere girt with frieiids or foes

and war materials to aid a cause in which we
are just as inuch interested as the people of
Britain. So I say that the word "gif t" is perhape
a mislorner. This measure is rather a bringing in of resources which we possess and are
con tribiiting to the common enterprise and
common purpose at the time when they are
most needed.
I think it shows to the world as a whole,
as well as to the United Nations, that we are
firrnly and irrevocably bound with Britain to
prosecute this war to the limit of our
resources. It indicates the unity of purpose
which exists between the people of Canada
and the people of Great Britain. Wben we
think of the situation as it exists to-day,
when we think of what we have been called
upon to do in the way of accepting restrictions
and making sacrifices, as compared to what
the people of Britain have been called on to
bear and face and endure, why should we not
join to the extent that this Bill proposes? We
must realize how much we have escaped of the
burdens, difficulties and trials they have
suffered. What would any person in Canada nlot give for an assurance that the trials
and tribulations so, nobly endured by the
people of Britain will flot be ours, but will be
kept from our shores if only we provide the
sinews of war, the materials and the manpower necessary to maintain this struggle and
bring it to a succes.sful conclusion?
I agree with the honoura-ble leader opposite
(Hon. Mr. Ballantyne) that the preamble,
amended as suggested by the honourable
senator from Vancouver South, should really
be incorporated in the Bill, because I believe
if more properly expresses the purpose and
intention. I arn whole-heartedly in support of
the principle of the Bill, and I rose to speak
only because I felt the occasion and the
matter too important for the pro-posaI to be
desît with perfunct-orily by a simple vote.
Hon. DONALD MacLENNAN: Honourable senators, may I ibe permitted to, say a
few words in conne ction with this Bill? I
should prefer to have it said that what is
provided for *by the Bill constitutes a contribution rather than a gift. While the sum
of $1,000,000,000 is a vast one, it is but a
small contribution when compared with what
Englandbas done and is now doing to, defend
Canada. There is no doubt in the world that
ex'ery effort put forth by England, no matter
in what quarter of the globe, is an effort
directly in defence of Canada, inasmuch as
Canada is directly threatened by enemies today. Consequently, as I say, I should prefer
to caîl this $1,000,000,000 a contribution towards
the success of the Allied effort rather than a
gift. There is no doubt that in one sense it

is a gift, inasmuch as England is not to pay
for -the $1,000,000,000 worth of food-stuffs and
war materials she will receive. Surely England
would flot desire food-stuffs or war materials
unless she needed them. Without this contribution shc' woiild have to pay $1,000,000,000
to get the goods and munitions she so badly
reqitires. When Canada says, "We shaîl furnish you goods and munitions to the value of
$1,000,000,000, for which you need not pay,"
the contribution is considerable and we may
be a little proud of being able to offer it.
Hon. F. B. BLACK: Honourable'senators,
I desire not to prolong the debate, but to
express my personal views on this matter. I
do not care whether wha-t is offered is called
a, contribution or a gift, or whether it is made
in the ferra of cash, goods or man-power, so
long as we assist in winning this war. It is
Our flrst duty to assist the Mother Country in
every possible way to carr to a successf.ul
conclusion the great confhiot in which we are
aIl engaged.
I arn heartily in accord with the gift of
31,000,000,000. 1 amn also heartily in accord
with our offering another gif t or contribution
of $1,000,000,000 should it be needed, and if
and when we can raise it. If we lose this war
everything is lost so far as Canada and the
Empire are concerned. If we win it, no contribution we or any other part of the Empire
can make is too great a sacrifice for the
success we shahl have achieved.
I have listened this afternoon with a great
deal of pleasure and patriotic pride f0 the flve
addresses made in this House, which are well
worthy of any public body in this country or
any other part of the Empire. I do not think
you would hear such addresses in any part of
the world but the democracies which are flghting for their freedomn and their very existence.
I want to express my hearty appreciation of
the Government's attitude in this particular
matter, and of the excellent addresses that have
been made in the debate. I arn sure every
honourable member on this side wholeheartedly supports this proposed gift or contribution to that part of the Empire, that
part of the British Commonwealth of Nations,
that part of the union of democracies which
we caîl Great Britaîn.
Hon. J. A. McDONALD:
Honourable
senators, I think that Canada, N orth, South
East and West, is unreservedly in faveur of
this gif t, or contribution, or whatever you wish
to caîl it, to Britain. May I add just a few
remarks, along an entirely different line from
those already expressed?
In my opinion the greatest story ever told
is the story of the Good Samaritan. A man
was robbed, beaten and thrown into the ditcb.

SENATE

118

The priest, whose duty it was ta look after the
fallen, had the eye ta sec hima Iying there, but
hie passed on. Then came the Levite, nearly
as important as the priest. He too had the
eye ta, see the man in the ditch, and hie had
the heart ta feel sorry for hlm, but lie likewise
passed on. Then came God's man, the man
fromn Samaria. He liad the eye te see the
sufferer in the ditch and the heart ta feel sarry
for him; but, more tlian that, bie said, "I must
do something." Like the rest of us, hie may
have committed sorte of the minor sins of life,
but hie picked the man up ont of the ditch,
took him away and cared for him. In helping
bis fellow-man hie was emphasizing God's greatest story. In short. bonourable senators, hie
was doing wbat Britain has been doing since
this war started, and what Canada is doing in
making a contribution ta Britain as provided
for ini this Bill.
In the last war it was rumoured that an
apparition at Mons had saved the British
Army. In this war it was rumoured that the
British Army and Navy were saved at Dunkirk because the waves were quieted and the
winds stilled, also in a mysteriaus way. And
there is a far more ancient rumour, that when
Toseph of Arimathea took the boy Jesus witb
dim on one of his trips ta Britain. Christ said:
'I love this land. b bless it and it will
endure."
I repeat, honourable senators, that in belping
Britain we are only imitating the deed of the
Good Samaritan. In this way we are doing
our part ta carry out the dtity taugbt ta man
in the greatest story ever told, and we are
privileged ta do this under the protection of
the greatest flag that has ever flown. God bless
the Union Jack, the emblemi of salvation
and liberty for ail.

our late lanîented leader, the Right Honourable Raoul Dandurand, I feel that with the
higb autharity hie enjoyed hie would have
voiced approval of this Bill in the name

of Canada as a whole, as well as in the name
of his native province.
Somte Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.

Han. Mr. BEAUREGARD: Senator Dandurand, as we knew him, was war consciaus.
In my opinion the degree of one's war con[Hon. Mr. McDONALD.]

sciausness represents the individual measure
of approval or critieisma of this war enactIn deînocratîc countries war conment.
sciousness is derived more from, sentiment
and reason than froma the gaverning power.
1 can safely say that the Allies declared war
long before countries concerned became war
consciaus. Is it flot generally adniitted that
France took the war seriously only after the
invasion of Poland, and that the United
lCingdom. itself becamte war cansciaus only
after the retreat from Dunkirk? If I am right
in that, honourable members, I migbt also
say that aur own people have begun to
realizc wbat this war means for them. only
since the fali of Hong Kong, Malaya, and
Singapore.
Right at the start of bostilities, witb full
confidence in the earnestness and the ability
of the presenit Administration, aur people gave
ample powers ta the executive body for the
conduet of the war. We know that Canadians
have generausly responded ta appeals to
subseribe ta war boans in arder ta hasten
production in war plants and sbipment of
supplies ta wberever they are required. On
the other hand, General McNaughton. whose
authority no one questions, bas expressed bis
satisfaction as ta enlistments.
'We now lcarn that our war effort, in addilion ta providing for the needs of aour awn
men, bas piled up a linige credit account of
1,700 millions of dollars against the sterling
area.
Sanie people wonder why at Ibis
moment, a long tirne abiead of tbe termination
of the war and of war expenditures, the present
Administration sbonld faveur the giviog away
of 1,000 million dlollars ta the United Kingdom, in addition ta the regnlarizing of aceounts
receiv-able of 700 million dollars already on the
books. The complaints, bonourable senators,
aeot so miuc ta the effeet that the Government was wrong in helping the Allies ta that
extent, or tbat it sbould refrain fromt doing
so in the future. Even those wbo complained
are aware tbat expenditures of this magnitude
bave artificially and abruptly ended ten years
of depression and brouglit t.bousands of workng mon ba('k ta the milis, wbere tbey are
leairning a trade anI earning a living. But they
wonder wbiy Canada, ont of taxes and borrowîngs. sbould make so, large a gift to a country
wealthier tban herseif. Sncb a criticismt bas
bren fully answered by tbe Minister of
Finance in bis remarks which we find in the
Hou7e of Commons Debates cf the l8th of
March instant. With your permission b will
quote this paragraph fronm page 1556:
1 need not emphasize that the Bill which
this resolution preeedes is one of first importance, and, indeed, mie without ceal precedent.
bts purpose is ta enable Canada ta miake the

MARCH 25, 1942
fullest and most effective use of its material
resources by feeding and equipping the people
and armed forces of Britain in order that they
may be able with us to win their fight and our
figlit againat a ruthicas and powerful foe who
threatens to make this year, 1942, the most
critical year in the history of civilization. The
f ree and unconditional gift f rom the people of
Canada to the people of Britain will express
emphatically the will of the Canadian people
to do everything in their power to help achieve
victory and thus assure their survival and ours.
Honourable senators, if such a candid and
comprehensive statement needs to be enlarged
by further comment, let me ask you this
question: Is this war a commercial venture or
is it a life-and-death struggle? If it is a commercial venture, let us kecp our books properly, as business men should do. Then our investments should keep pace with aaticipated
profits and partners' contributions. If. on the
other hand, this war is a life-and-death struggle, as to the vast mnaiority of us it appears
to be, shall we treat it as a business venture?
It is a fact that sinýce the outbreak of the
war Canada has been able not only ýto look
aftcr its own army, but also to> supply its Allies
with cquipment and other necessities to the
value of 1,700 million dollars. No one can
reasonably pretend that Canada aliould have
refrained f rom producing such equipment and
supplies, since it appears she <could afford to do
it in an ail-out war effort. May we not fairly
compare the waging of life-and-deatli war by
the Allies to the carrying of a very heavy
load by three or four men jointly? While
every man engaged in carryrng this heavy
load is contributing bis full strength to the
job, is it a proper time for any one of Vbemn
to lessen bis efforts if lie happens to think,
rigbtly or wrongly, that one of 'bis comrades
is bearing up a few'pounds lesa than lie is?
What should Canada bave done? Was it
right to lielp carry the load jointly with the
United Kingdom and lier other Allies, or
ahould she have devoted ber productive powers
to lier own needs only, whicb in 'terims of war
'would have meant the equipping and manning of mucli larger armed forces? I doubt
wbetber the very persons who bave compl*ained
would sugg-est that Vhs second course shouki
bave been adopted. I su'bmit, honourable
senators, that Canada adopted the riglit course.
We are proud to be described as the arsenal of
democracy. If we still deserve that name for
some time to come and keep .prod.ucing and
selling at full capacity, we ohall pile up furtber
large accounts receivable, large enougli to
upset our international 'trade facilities wben
the war is over.
If we already bave in mind the abandonment of týhis billion dollars, and possibly
more. at the termination of the war . we mrigbt
now consider making this gift as a token to

Britishi gallantry, wihicli we aIl agree saved
the situation by resistance to a daily downpour of steel and fire during the summer osf
1940. While the United K'ingdom was waging all alone the war on bebaîf of the Allies,
our war, we were piling up that account
receivable of a billion dollars. I remember
days in 1940 when we would readily bave given
up the billion dollars for the assurance that
London would withstand the treatment it was
receiving at the banda of thie common foe.
Wehave the billion dollars on our books under
the heading of accounts receivable. We are
not too sure that we shaîl bave the courage
to, colleet it, for we are already afmaid of an
alinormal balance in favour of the Canadian
dollar and againat the pound. Ia a large
measure the proposed gifit is a delit we owe
Vo British gallantry for not having bast our
war at a time twben we could volunteer only
equipment and supplies. I for one,,hlonourable
members, agree with t-his statement of the
Minister of Finance:
The free andl unconditional gift froma the
people of Canada to the people of Britain will
express emphatically the will of the Canadian
people to do everything in their power to help
achieve victory and thus assure their survival
and ours.

WHEAT ACREAGE REDUCTION BILL
FIRST READING
A message was received from the House of
Commons; with Bill 12, an Act respecting
Wheýat Acreage Reduction.
The Bill was read the first time.
9ECOND READING

Hon. Mr. KING: Honourable senators, I
think you now have in your bands Bill 12,
an Act respecting wheat acreage reduction.
I sbould like to bave this Bill considered on
the motion for second reading and then
referred to, the Committee on Agriculture and
Forestry. Perbaps my honourable friend from
Peel (Hon. Mr. Marshall) will make the
motion for second reading.
Hon. DUJNCAN MeL. MARSHALL: Honourable senators, as bas been said, this and
tbe two. other wlieat bills whicb bave been
referred to are more or less predicated one
on the other, but after all they can lie taken

SENATE
only one at a time. Honourable members
will recall that last year a wheat acreage
reduction plan was dealt with by regulations
published in the Canada Gazette of October
13. This Bill to some extent embodies those
regulations.
There is no doubt that the three wheat
bills are difficult to deal with, in that they
involve the expenditure of a good deal of
money, but this expenditure is rendered
necessary by war-time demands. It is essential that proper supplies of food be sent to
our Allies. Wheat, as a matter of fact, is
one of the main requirements in time of war,
but never in any previous war was there such
a surplus of wheat as we have to-day. We
are up against two difficulties. We must
avoid the risk of not having enough wheat
to sec us through the war; and we must
encourage our farmers to raise wheat when
the markets do not want it. If the wheat of
Western Canada or of the world to-day had
to bu sold on market demand it would not
command very high prices. Therefore the
Government has been supporting the wheat
market for the last two years. It is intended
by this Bill to continue that support, and also
to reduce the acreage in wheat and encourage
production of grains that we may need more.
In war-time we need meat, bacon, cheese
and eggs; and we may have to produce more
butter now that Australia and New Zealand
are not in a position to furnish supplies. Up
to quite recently Britain did not want any
butter from us at all, but was clamouring for
cheese and bacon. To-day she also wants
milk in large quantities, and wool. Now that
the United States, Australia and New Zealand,
the great wool-producing countries of the
world, are engaged in the war and consuming
more wool at home, besides finding greater
difficulties in shipping wool overseas, we
must make provision to supply the deficiency.
We must have wheat, but, as I have said,
we have to-day really more wheat than we
need. One of the purposes of this Bill is to
encourage production of the bacon, cheese,
eggs, milk, and wool that may be required
during the war.
As first drafted the Bill did not include flax
in the substitute crops, but a price was fixed
for flax at 82.25 a bushel. Afte-r some consideration it was felt that that was not sufficient
to encourage the growing of flax in Western
Canada. Those who have lived in the West
know that for a time we grew flax extensively.
Why? Because it was a kind of crop that
you got by the way. You started in with a
section of land and broke what you could in
June, July and August for wheat next year,
but in the meantime you could put in flax
Hon. Mr. MARSHALL.

and so steal an extra crop from the land. The
result was we grew great quantities of flax in
Western Canada when settlers were bringing
their farms into cultivation. That period is
past now, and flax is no longer a crop that
crowds out wheat. Land in Western Canada
has now a fairly liberal supply of weeds, particularly where the weather has been dry; so
the growing of flax there is, I am afraid,
likelv to b more or less disappointing.
As a matter of fart it is not flax at all that
we grow in Western Canada; it is linseed.
Linseed and flax are virtually twins, but not
Siamese

twins.

Flax is grown

to be

pulled

and woven to make linen, while linseed is a
grain we grow to make linsced-meal cakes or
oil. In saine parts of Eastern Canada flax has
been grown, but none in Western Canada so
far as I know. Linseed is really the correct
w-ord to use, but flax is a very common nane
and has, always been applied to the growing
of linseed in Western Canada. Whether as a
result of the passing of this Bill the growing
of this crop will be stimulatcd to any great
extent is problematical, for the reasons I have
already stated.
I have no doubt that several honourable
senators who are interested in conditions in
Western Canada have followed the discussion
of this Bill in the other House. When introduced there it contained a penalty clause for
misrepresentation in connection with returns
of acreage reduction. The penalty applied
whether or net the man making the return
knew it was incorrect. The penalty clause
was amended bv tho addition of the words.
"who bas been knowingly and wilfully guilty."
The la wyer members of this House will understand the meaning. A clause was added that
no moneys payable under the Bill should be
subject to garnishment or attachment, or be
assignable either at law or in equity.
I should add that the bonus to be paid for
simmer-fallow has been reduced from $4 to
$2 an acre, which is the amount paid with
respect to other coarse grains.
I move second reading of the Bill. I would
suggest that after it has been discussed it be
referred to the Committee on Agriculture, by
w-hom it can be dealt with clause by clause.
Hon. C. C. BALLANTYNE: Honourable
senators, I do net pretend for one moment
to be very familiar with Western conditions.
We are fortunate in having in this Chamber
many grain growers with first-hand knowledge
of the wheat business, and other members,
like my honourable friend from Peel (Hon.
Mr. Marshall), who have had experience in
Western Canada.
He has told us about flax or linseed oil.
That does happen to be a subject that I
know something about. Some thirty-six years

MARCH 25, 1942
ago, when I was managing director of a large
paint and varnish concern which owned linseed
oit milîs, I said to my friend Mr. Fielding,
then Minister of Finance: "Why don't you
put a duty on flaxseed? The beat flax ini the
world is grown in our Canadian West. It is
equal to the best Russian Baltic fiax. Stili
we have ta buy ail our flaxseed under the
Duluth market; flaxseed grown in North and
South Dakota." As a result a 15 per cent
duty was imposed on flax. Immediately the
production expanded and, if my memory
serves me right, the output was something
like twelve million bushels. The fiaxseed
itself was most excellent. The argument I
heard when in the West at that time was
that if you were late in getting your regular
crops in, fiax was a good thing to'use on a
first breaking.
I am flot opposîng this Bill, but it appears
somewhat strange ta me that when you come
to the allowance of $2 an acre for summerfallow-which is very generous-you also
include coarse grains, and flax and grass.
According to a gentleman in another place,
these prairie farm, bonuses would amount to
$10.000,000, and the acreage bonuses to
We haiýe not touched yet the
$30,000,000.
increased amount ta be provided if the price
of wheat is raised from 70 cents to 90 cents
a bushel. I merely draw the attention of the
honourable senator from Peel and the acting
leader to these things for this particular
reason, of which ahl honourable senators are
fully aware. While this country is not comnplaining, we are labouring under tremendous
taxation due to the war. We knowr that the
deadline for income tax is Tuesday next. It
behooves this Government to do everything
it can to retrench. If conditions in the West
are so bad that this legislation is absolutely
necessary, then of course I have nothing to
add, and I leave further discussion of the
Bill to those who know much more about it
than I do. But living where I do,' I arn
often asked: "Why are these demands in
regard to our Western friends recurring and
increasing?"
Before resuming my seat 1 should like to
direct attention to what my illustrious predecessor (Right Hon. Mr. Meighen) had to
say last session in regard ta extraordinary
powers given to the Minister. Section 13, on
page 5 of the Bill, provides:
The Minister may, with the approval of the
Governor in Council, appoint such administrative and technical officers and employees as
he may deem necessary for the purposes of this
Act and at such remuneration as may be
likewise approved.
These are tremendous and unusual powers ta
give to a Minister of the Crown, and I do

121

hope that when the Bill is in committee
honourable senators will agree with me that
some restriction should be imposed; flot that
1 have flot confidence in the Minister who is
handling these affairs now, but because I think
it is wrong for any Minister in any Government to have such unlimited powers as those
I have just referred to. I hope that we shaIl
hear from a nuinher of practical grain growers,
and that they will informi us as to why we
have to pass such legisiation as this. It appears
to be very wide ini its scope; but if it is
necessary for the people of the West to have it,
I have no further suggestions to offer.
Bon. W. A. BUCHANAN: The honourable
member from Vancouver South (Hon. Mr.
Farris) suggested a change in the preamble of
one of the Bis before us this afternoon.
If I were making any proposai at ail with
regard to this Bill, it would be to change
the titie so that it might explain exactly the
purpose of the Bill, which is to try to induce
the Western farmer to stop raising too much
wheat and go into the raising of something
else. I am inclined to think that without
legisiation of this kind the farmers would stay
in wheat and the surplus would grow, and we
should have a more serious problem than ever.
I know something of the operations of this
measure, and would illustrate them by mentioning the case of a man not far from my own
city of Iethbridge. By reason of the bonus
for summer-fallow last year, this man, operating a farma of many thousands of acres, put in
1,600 acres of corn, and to that extent got out
of the raising of wheat. There are people who
have doubted the possibility of raising corn
in Western Canada. I may tell them that corn
is being raised in southern Alberta, and the
man I speak of boasts that he has the biggest
field of corn in Canada, and probably he is
right. What hie did he was induced to do
by this legisiation. Otherwise he probably
would have raised wheat on that land and
would have added to the surplus. There was
a good resuit from the raising of that 1,600
acres of corn, because a rancher took down
five hundred steers and fed them there during
the late fall and winter. Some of those cornfed steers were shipped, and I am told that
the prices received for them topped the
market.
As I said in the beginning, the purpose of
this legisiation is ta get the farmers out of
the raising of wheat and into the raising of
coarse grains, such as corn, flax, oats and
barley. As one who has lived in Western
Canada for a considerable time and who has
been up against the problema of the farmers
throughout many years, 1 would say that this
legisiation is right along the line of what

122

SENATE

our Eastern friends have been advocating for
years, namely, putting the farmers of the
West into mixed farming as much as possible.
If we can get them into these other grains
we are doing something to encourage mixed
farming.
There may be some criticism in this
Chamber and the other, as well as in Eastern
Canada, of the amount of money which is
being appropriated to maintain agriculture in
Western Canada. There will always be a
difference of opinion as to whether that policy
is right or wrong. I am not going to enter
any controversy as between Eastern Canada
and Western Canada. I do know that because
of the needs in Great Britain to-day the
British farmer is being bonused to raise
many food-stuffs; and for many years assistance has been given in the United States to
all types of agriculture-cotton and tobacco
in the south, and other forms of farming in
the mid-west.
Western Canada is not to blame for the situation which exists there to-day. The whole of
Canada is responsible for the settlement of
Western Canada. People went into lands in
the West that are good only for raising wheat,
and we citber have to keep those people there
and allow them to raise what they can, or else
inake then a charge upon the country and
give them relief through the provincial governments, the Federal Government assisting. I
believe that this Bill is along the line of what
most people want. The bankers and induîstrialists who are acquainted with Western Canada
know that anything which tends towards diversified agriculture in the West is an advance,
and I believe that sooner than we expect we
shall pass through the period when anything
of this nature will have te be placed on the
Statute Book frem year to year, because the
farmer will have learnt that it is to his advantage to do what this law is encouraging and bas
been encouraging.
Hon. A. L. BEAUBIEN: May I offer just a
word or two on this Bill? Last year we bad a
wheat acreage reduction which was brought
about by a vote of the House of Commons.
This year the Government is bringing about
the same thing by means of legislation. It is
estimated that in 1940 we sowed twenty-nine
million acres into wheat in Canada. Through
the acreage reduction plan of the Government
last year that acreage of wheat was reduced to
twenty million acres.
But in spite of the
reduction of nine million acres we still have
a large surplus of wheat in Canada. The wheat
question is national in its scope, because the
whole economy of Canada is dependent to a
very large extent on the wheat production of
Western Canada. In years gone by I have
Hon. Mr. BUCHANAN.

met many industrialists who told me that
business was good in their line of activity
provided Western Canada had a good wheat
crop.
Now, in order te induce the farmers to continue the reduction in the number of acres
sowed to wheat, the Government is continuing
the acreage reduction bonuses. The Government's purpose in doing this is te induce
the farmers to produce a cereal which will
be consumed on the farm and sold on the
hoof. That is the main principle behind this
legislation. If we can achieve that result, we
may be able to reduce the carry-over and at
the same time induce our farming population
to produce a commodity for which there is a
market and a demand.
This legislation, or the principle of this
legislation, was in effect for the year 1941. J
saw it in operation. It was not perfect, but, on
the whole, if in that year we had had the
weather conditions we had in 1940 and there
had been no wheat-reduction legislation. there
would have been a tremendous surplus in this
country, and it would have been a much
heavier burden than it is to-day.
Flax was included, not at the request of the
farmers, but because it was asked for by the
people who produce linseed oil. They claimed
that the fixing of the price of flax at S225 a
bushel, and bonusing it to the extent of $2 an
acre, would produce this linseed flax.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE:
It has been
produced for the last twenty-five years.
Hon. A. L. BEAUBIEN: I may tell the
honourable gentleman that if he will ceme to
Western Canada with me and start growing flax
he will be broke in five years.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: I believe that.
Hon. A. L. BEAUBIEN: I do not know
anybody who bas grown flax continuously on
his farm and has not gone broke. And growing it pretty nearly broke my back, because
there are weeds to deal with. If you put
land in flax this year, you must summerfallow next year, even if it is new land,
because in the year following flax you cannot
sow any kind of cereal and have a crop.
As J say, flax was included because oil was
needed by the industrialists and for the war
effort; and the $2 bonus is te induce the
farmer to try to grow flax.
Hon. R. B. HORNER: Honouraible senators, I wish to make a remark or two, and to
inject something new into this discussion.
The honourable senator from Peel (Hon. Mr.
Marshall) spoke of "a large amount of money"
in connection with this Act. So far as the
coming year is concerned, there will be a very

MARCH 25, 194
small arnount of money paiid for summerfallow. Al.most ahl the farmers 1 know-there
are a faw ex.ceptions-summer-fallowed, last
year. Ia some cases they summer-fallowed
their wlioia acreage. It is not likely that that
land will be summer-fallowed a second year
in succession.
Then *there is this ta 'be remembered-and
paî'haps it will relieve the minds of honaurable senators from Eastern Canada: on evary
laad of wheatthat is sold tihere ià a ýdeduction
of ana par cent; sa that in a sansa the farmers
of Western Canada ara contributing ta tbe
fund for tha benefit of their neighbours.
One of the causas responsible ýfor discontinuanca of the grawing aof flax was the importation of cheap vegatabla aiýls and linsead into
this country. The price became so low that

Western farmiers could not graw fiax at a
profit. I do nat hesitate ta say that this

Sa 1 would suggest that this Bill should be

take delivery of 230 million bushels, but it
took less than 200 million bushels, because
that is ail that was offered. This year the
Government is willing to take 280 million
bushels; but I arn sorry to say that in my
view, which I hope is wrong. the condition
of the soil in Western Canada, beyond one
hundred miles west of Winnipeg, is such as
flot to give promise of a bumper crop.
The assistance provided for in aIl this
legislation is purely an attempt, and I think
a proper one, f0 keep farmers on the land
when they have a crop failuire. At best the
assistance is on the very minimum basis. As
to this particular measure, what was said by
an honourable member is largely frue, that
it is an attempt to induce farmers to switcb
from wheat to other grains. Therefore it is
commendable. But I arn one of those who
hold to the view expressed the other day in
the House of Commons Committee on Agriculture by Mr. J. H. Wesson, president of the
wheat pool in Saskatchewan, that we cannot
be sure of having a big surplus of wheat
when the war is over. I believe the Miniister
of Agriculture made a similar sfatement in
another place about a year ago. I arn ail in
favour of this legislation, because not only is
the switching from wheat to barley or oats
or other grains a good fhing in itself, but
if will also help to improve the soil. However,
I emphiasize that we mnust not be too sure of
having a big surplus of wheat when the war
is over.
I arn in very close touch wif h our farming
situation in the West, flot only through rny
contact with farmers, but also because I farrn
a little on my own account. Probably the
definition that William Jennings Bryan once
gave of an agriculturiat would apply to me.
H1e was once asked if he was a farmer, and he
replied: "No.
I arn an agriculturist."
In
reply to a further question as to the difference
between the two, Bryan said, "A farmer
makes his money in the country and spends
if in the city; an agriculturist makes his
money in the city and spends it in the
country." I think 1 belong to the latter class.
I w'ant to address a few remarks f0 Eastern
Canada; not so miich to Quebec and Ontario
as to the Maritime Provinces. We of the
West have a very warm feeling for the
Maritimes, because we know what it is to ha
a poor relation. We know how hard their
struggle is. If ever the Maritimes, or Quebec
and Ontario, face a problemr such as the West
faces to-day, they iîli flnd no one more eager
to give assistance through legislative means,
if that is possible. than the people of Western
Canada. I say that this legislation is for the
benefit of aIl Canada. I do flot know of any
Hon. Mr. HAIG.

more pofent influence for peace than the
fully-stocked granaries of this country. There
is no more useful food that can be offered
to the af arving people of Europe than our
wheat, for any other which will keep as well
in1 s' orage for an indefinif e period.
I arn heartily in accord with this legislation.
It will be of great benefit to the farrning life
of Western Canada in general, and specifically
it will help in the development of diversified
farming, w hich nlot only is highly important
for the West now, but will continue to be so
under the conditions that undouhtedly will
exisf when this war is over.
Hon. N.M. PATERSON: Honourable senafors, as the witnesses with respect f0 ali three
Bills wiil likely he the saine, I entirely agree
withi the suggestion that the Bills be referred
to the saine joint commiffees. I might drop
the remark that while if appears that in the
interest of Canada we should shorten our
crop, because of the surplus, we should
remember that sometimes our calculations are
not enfirely correct; and if we infend f0 get
200 million bushels or thereabouts fo England
if may ho necessary, in certain circumstances,
to ship a greaf deal more than that. If figures
were quoted showing the quantify that arrives
there, as compared with the quantify actually
shipped, the difference might surprise some
honourable senators. So we must be careful
not f0 shorfen our crop too rnuch.
With regard to flaxseed, if bas been stated
tlhaf production lias decreased from, I think,
12,000,000 hushiels f0 about 3,000,000 bushels.
We in flie elevator business have ibeen always
more or less happy f0 sc e
production of
flaxseed reducedý in thec West.
I do not
think an elevator owner ever handled flax
withouf coming ouf short. If is prefty slippery stuif and seeps flirougli aIl cracks. Consequently we have had f0 deal with many
shorfages. But in the intercsf of fthe West, I
think, we should ail he content f0 sec an inicrease in the growth of flaxseed or linzeed in
the West. This would save impurting large
quantifies.
Prohabiy the reason why the
production cf fiaxseed in Western Canada has
been more or ýless low is ftie severe comnpetition
from the Argentine. A great deal of flaxseed
was brouglit in through Montreal, but much
of it was re-cxported f0 fthe United States,
îvhich is also a large importer from the
Argentine. Now thaf that situation has been
corrected, I think we shall be glad f0 sec
an incrcased flaxseed acreage in the West.
Hon. W. M. ASELTINE: As I fhink honourabie members aIýl know, I arn very much
ioterested in the growing of wheat, and therefore in these Bis. I arn one of those who are
nlot at ail worried about the wheat surplus,

MARCH 25, 1942
of which we hear so much. At the present
time, the reserves of moisture in Western
Canada are the lowest in years. In Saskatchewan there was no ra.in last year after the
23rd of June, the resuit being a short crop
for us. Manitoba had heavy rains in the
faîl, but as you go West and get into Saskatchewan, and then into Alberta, you find the
moisture reserves are very Iow. Moreover,
we have had the miidest winter in years;
indeed, we have had no winter at ail in
Western Canada. There is no snow, no moisture of any kind, and I arn looking for a very
short crop, if flot a crop failure. Therefore I
think we need flot concern ourselves at al
about having a very -big surplus after this
coming year, and I ar n ot the only one
holding that opinion. In my experience since
1911, after a mild winter with very little snow
and moisture you are aimost sure to have a
poor crop; whereas an old-time, tough, cold
winter, with lots of snow and moisture, mieans
a great crop.
I arn pretty well in agreement with the
view of those honourable senators who have
said that the three Bis are closely related.
0f course, I arn not satisfied with the price of
90 cents a bushel. I think that if the Government is going to buy only saine 280,000,000
bushels, it will practically cover only the cropfailure areas, and, if we should happen to get
a big crop, the rest of the wheat will ail have
to remain on the farmis. I agree with the
honourable senator from Saskatchewan North
(Hon. Mr. Horner) as to the amount of money
we shahl obtain under Bill 12, respecting wheat
acreage reduction. In our district at any rate,
in West Central Saskatchewan, the summerfallow of hast year must be phaced in crop
this year, and so far as I know, hardly anyone
wilh obtain payment of a large bonus, if any
at ail, under section 4. However, there are
other sections of the West where a certain
acreage may remain in surnmer-fallow, and
those sections wihl of course find the proposed
hegisiation a great benefit. It wiIl help us to
go into the growing of other kinds of grain,
and if this Bihl does flot help in any other
way, that in itself, I think, will be a great
advantage.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bihl was
read the second time.
REFERRED TO COMMITTEE

The Hon,. the SPEAKER: When shahl thie
Bill be read a third time?
Hon. Mr. KING: It has been suggested
that it be referred to a joint committee composed of members of the Committees on
Agriculture and Forestry, and Banking and
Commerce. This is an unusual procedure, and
as the measure is to a considerable extent

125

financial, I propose that it be referred to the
Committee on Banking and Commerce. As in
well known, every honourable senator may
attend a standing cornmittee whether hie be a
member of it or not. I suggest to my honourable friend that hie proceed ini that way.
Hon. Mr. MARSHALL:- Then wîll the
honourable acting leader make the motion?
Hon. Mr. KING. I make the motion accordingly. I wouhd ask the comrnittee to try to
meet to-morrow morning in order that we
rnay have this legishation before the Senate
to-morrow afternoon.
Hon. Mr. LEGER: There is nothing in our
rules to prevent us from constituting t'he
Committee on Agriculture and the Committee on Banking and Commerce into a special
committee to consider the three Bis.
Hon. Mr. DONNELLY: I agree with the
honourabie leader of the Goverament for more
than one reason. The Committee on Agriculture is a smali committee. As chairman of
that committee, I have no objection to the
Bihl being referred to the Committce on Banking and Commerce, for I arn aware that three
of the members of the ýCommittee on Agri,culture are not present and will not he able
to attend to-morrow. As has been already
stated, senators have the right to be present
at meetings of any standing committce and
Join in the dicussion. I arn also a member of
the Comnmittee on Banking and Commerce,
and I amn sure ýmembers of that committee wil
be pleased to have nny senators who are
interested in the Bis exercise their right to
attend and give us the benefit of their views.
Hon. Mr. KING: Yes.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was

SENATE

He said: Honourable senators, this Bill bias
been considered by the committee, which
reports the samne with slight amendments.
These amendments are purely verbal and do
flot affect the import of the Bill.
Hon. J. W. de B. FARRIS: Ronourable
senators, I move in amendment that the first
and second amendments in the committee's
report be struck out. I understand that two
motions are necessary to do what I propose,
and I makze this first motion for the purpose
of moving a second one to amend an amendment wbicb the committee made this morfiing in section 4. This is donc after consultation with and on the recommendation of the
Law Clerk ot the Senate.

Bcfore subsection 2 of section 4 of the Bill
was amended by the committee it read:
Notw ithstanding a,,y provision ef the Senate
and House ef Conurnons Act or enly other Act
of the 1arliament of Canada, paynients under
this Act or any proviens Order ef the Governor
in Courncil mey bo niade to a Meniber of the

with respect to whieat acreage reduction subsequeuut to .1940 and ne sucli payient shall rendei
any such _Moner ineligible to sit or vote in
the Seniate or- House of Commnons of Canada.
Thcre are several things wrong with that
clause, some of whicli were cured this morning. Mr. MacNoill lias conferred witb, net
ail the lawycrs in the Senate, for hie has net
had an opportunity te do that, but with some,
including, ry honourable friond fromn Winnipeg Soîth-Centre (Hon. Mr. Haig) and
myseif, and it is his considcred opinion that
the amendments made by tbe committee are
net snfficient.
One deteet stili existing in the stibsection
is tînt it fails te make any exemption with
That

(lefect wonld be cured by the amendment I
am about te propose. The Law Clerk's opinion
was, before the matter was studied, that the
section wvas retroactive; but new, after consideration bias been gîven te the point, bis
opinion is that the effect ef tbe section as
now o orded is net retroactive. Censequently
an amecndaient is necczssary. Tbe second omission was partly cnred by the amendment made
in committee tbis morning. It related te, the
defcct in the original wording, wbich says
tbat îuaymients under tbe Act shahl net render

the Act would disquality a man freim being

Tberetore I move tbat the flrsf and second
amendments in tbe report et the cemmitfee

be struck out. If thaf is carrici I sball move
another amendment.

Hon. Mr. KING: Honourable senators, we
biad tbis section betore us tbis morning, and
the bonourable senater trom Winnipeg SouthCentre was in doubf as te the effecf et the
amendment wc then made. I am sure if these
gentlemen, having get fogetber with our
Parliamentary Counsel, are, after mature considerafion. et opinion the section sbotîld be

the Goveriinient.

MARCH 26, 1942
he saw the honourable member fromn Vancouver South (Hon. Mr. Farris), who had
taken the same view independently. I think
the amendment now proposed covers the
defeet. In my opinion, without this amendment a member of the House of Commons
is out of bis seat ex facto. Therefore it is

not a question of voting and sitfing; he could
not vote and sit.

I think that was not the

intention of the draftsman. Let there be no
misundcrstanding on the part of those honourable senators who were flot on the committee.

This is not special legisiation to protect
members of Parliament, either of the Senate
or the bouse of Commons; it is merely for
the purpose of clarification. A farmer, who
might be a member of the House of Commons
or of the Senate, would under this proposed
legislation be entitled to $2 au acre for
acreage reduction. It was, I submit, neyer
intended that the Senate and flouse of
Commons Act should apply to such a payment. In Manitoba the telephone systema is
owned by the Government, and somebody
threatened to take proceedings against a
member of the Government who had a telephone in bis house. We had to enact special
legisiation so that a member of the Legisiature
could rent a telephone.
I support the
amendment.
The amendment was a-greed to.
THIRD READING

Hon. Mr. KING moved the third reading
of the Bill as amended.
Hlon. Mr. FARRIS: I move in amendment:
That Bill 12 be not now read a third time,
but that it be amnended as follows:
For subelause 2 of clause 4 substitute the
following:(2) Notwithstanding any provision of the
Senate and flouse of Coinmons Act, or of any
other Act of the Parliament of Canada, payinents under this Act or any previous Order
of the Governor in Council. relating to the
payn:.ent of wheat acreage bonus, may be made
to a meiriber of the Senate or of the flouse of
Conunons of Canada, with respect to whcat
acreage reduction subsequent to 1940, and no

paymient as aforesaid or payments heretofore
made-

That is new.

disqualification,That is new.
-or vacate the seat of any member of the
flouse of Commons of Canada, or render such
memnber ineligible to sit or vote in the said
flouse, and no person apphying for or recerving
any such payment shahl thereby be disqualified
as a candidate at any Dominion eleetion.

Bon. Mr. MacARTHUR:
Honourable
senators, this question was taken up in the
Committee on Banking and Commerce this
morning, and I should like to have the views
of the chairman of the committee with regard
to it. Our Law Clerk and other lawyers were
present in the .committee when tihese matters
were discussed, and we came to an understanding. What is proposed may or .may flot
be superfluous. 1 do flot know. But the
honourable senator from Vancouver South
(Hon. Mr. Farris) bas referred to a member
of the Senate or of the House of Commons
having a contract with the Govern-ment, and
I should like to know if a -man who has
entered into a contract with the Government
is now immune from any penalty.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: No. This applies only to
contracts under the Wheat Acreage Reduction legisiation.
The amendment was agreed to.
The motion for the third reading of the
Bill was agreed to, and the Bill, as amended,
was read the third time, and passed.

TO

On the Orders of the Day:
Hon. Mr. KING: Honourable members,
may I briog to the attention of the Senate
that part of the Civil Service Act which
provides for the absorption into the public
service of private secretaries who have served
as suých for a minimum period of three years.
A case in point is that of Mr. LaRocque, who
was selected by the late Leader of the Govcrament in this Bouse, and appointcd by
Order in Council as Private Secrctary to the
Minister on October 23, 1935. In addition to
his secretarial duties Mr. LaRocque lias acted
for some six years as temporary Clerk, of
French Minutes of Proceedings and Journals
of the Senate, that position having been
vacant since the retirement on superannuation
of Mr. A. L. Garneau. I am advised that Mr.
LaRocque is experienced and is well qualified
to -perform the duties of that position. I
therefore have the honour to move, seconded
by the Hon. Senator Coté:
That under the provisions of sections sixty
and sixty-ooe of the Civil Service Act, chapter
twenty-two of the Revised Statutes of Canada,
1927, Paul LaRocque, Private Secretary to the
late Right Honourable Raoul Dandurand, be
appointed Clerk of French Minutes of Proceedings and Journals of the Senate, in the place
andi stead of Alfred L. Garneau, retired, and
that he be paid a salary of $3,120 per annuin
as from Ist April, 1942.

Hon. Mr. KING: I avas of that opinýion too.

No change in salary.

Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Honourable senators,
1 rise, flot for the purpose of opposing this

ask where the Cornmittee on Internai Economy
and Contingent Accounts cornes in. 1 bave
observcd during the last seven, eight or ten

without being unkind, mcrely a înakesbift
which rneets about the day before prorogation
to rosih throughi sorne things that presurnab]y
it bias not hiad under consideration. I am wondüring- if this is not a mnatter whiclî might
consistently and logically corne before that

te ibis proposal, but it scems to me that the
Committee on Internai Econorny and Contingent Accounts ouglit to meet cachier in tbe
.sssion-rnaybe more tban once-to conisider
qn(.stions relating to the personnel of tbe
Senate. In that connDection there are a number of questions on wbichi I sbould lik-e to
secure sorne information, and in order to
accomplish tbat purpose I have to undertake
to rnake an ioquiry, which I do net xxant to

I think that the pacticular matter before us,
even thougli it rnay be 100 per cent riglit,
should go to the cornmiittee for consideration,
and that a recommendation should coîne frorn
the cornrittee to tbis House.

Thei Senate proceeded to consider the report
of the Standing Cornrittec on Misceilaneous

Hon. W. H. MeGUIRE: Honourable nierabers, I wish to say just a few words witb regard
to this Bill. Unfortunately, being indisposed,
I w-as net able to bie present at the meeting
of the comrnittep yesterday. I understand
tliat, as other committees were sitting at
the sarne tirne, there was niot a full âttendance
of the imembers of the Private Bills Committee. Furtbcrrnore, the young member of a
lawî firni wbo put this matter 'beforeime severai
months ago lias sînce gene into the Covernment service and bias been unable to instruct
me. I amn told, bowever, that a member of a
iaw firm was present at the cornrittee's meeting yesterday. I thin'k tbe only matter for
enrsideratien is wbetber it is reasonabie and
proper to change the company's name as proposed .by the Bill, and rny opinion is that after
further study the cemmittee wouid arrive at
a satisfactory understanding. If it is necessary
te have any change made in tise new name proposed for the coînpany, that could be decided
in cornrittee. As I sbould like te have time
te get additional instructions, I would meve
that the Bihl be referred back te the coymmittee for furtber consideration after the Easter
recess. It is a srnall matter and the cernrnittee wouid net need te take long te deai
with it. I arn desirous of being presenit when
the Bill dees corne before the committee agamn.

been made, partly on the ground that the
.sponsor of the Bill (Hon. Mr. McGuire)
was indisposed yesterday. 1 may say that
I ar n ot a member of the Miscellaneous
Private Bis Committee, but I happened to
he present ,at its meeting yesterday, because
I was interested in another bill, and I stayed
to listen to the discussion on this Bill C.
The promoters of the Bill were represented
by very able counsel, and they also had the
assistance of the Superintendent of Insurance, Mr. Finlayson. But there was opposition to the Bill. There appeared before the
committee the president or manager of a
company called the Fidelity Insurance Company of Canada, a company which I understand bas been in business for many years
and is doing considerable business, but not
a business of life insurance.
From the
evidence given before the committee yesterday it would appear the business of this
objecting company up to the present tîme
has been limited to what is known in the
insurance trade as fidelity business, whereas
the applicant. company, whose present name
is the Saskatchewan Life Ingurance Company,
is a if e insurance company. This applicant
company has petitioned Parliament to change
its naine to Fidelity Lif e Assurance Company,
and the representative of the Fidelity Insurance Company of Canada said: "We object
to this naine being granted by Parliament
to the Saskatchewan Life Insurance Company.
It may be quite proper and legitimate for
the Saskatchewan Lif e Insurance Company
to wish to have its namne changed, but surely
it, can find a namne which does not clash witb
ours." That is an argument which bas a
great deal of strength, particularly in view
of the fact, as explained to the committee,
that although the Fidelity Insurance Company
of Canada has so far limited its activities
to fidelity insurance, it may, under its
charter and the general provisions of the
Insurance Act, apply at any time for a
licence to write life insurance.

.

129

provisions of the Insurance Act for a licence
from the Dominion Government, the issue
of which licence is, under the law, subjeet to
an order of the Treasury Board." So to a
number of members of the committee and to
myself the position appeared quite clearly
to be this: if Parliament now changed the
naine of tbis applicant company to Fidelity
Lufe Assurance Company, and if necxt year,
in the exercise of its general capacity, the
Fidelity Insuiance Company of Canada
applied to the Department of Insurance for
a licence to carry on the business of ljfe
insurance, it would be told, "We are sorîy,
but we caiinot allow you to do life insurance
business under your name, because there
already is a company doing life insurance
business called the Fidelity Life Assurance
Company." In that event this old company,
to which Parliament many years ago gave
the naine Fidelity Insurance Company of
Canada, would be effectively deprived of
the exercise of its capacity to enter the life
insurance field.
If I had had a vote on the committee I
would have voted against the Bill, because
it seems to me that objection is fatal to the
applicant. It is fatal to the applicant, I think,
because, in giving a namne to an organization
which it has created, Parliament should take
cane to make sure that that namne is not such
as to clash or conflict with the namne of an
organization already established. In other
words, although we are not bound by the law
that we made when we ounselves passed the
Companies Act, I think the provisions of that
Act with regard to the gnanting of a namne
indicate clearly the course of conduet we
should adopt. May I for a minute just nefer
to the Companies Act? Section 25 provides
as follows:
A company shahl not be incorporated with a

naine which is the saine or similar to the namne
under whieh any other company, society, asso-

law and proprietary rights which partnerships,
firms and corporations have to the exclusive
use of their own names.
Hon. Mr. BUCHANAN: Has the Privy
Counoil's decision in the Pepsi-Cola and CocaCola case any relation to this matter?
Hon. Mr. COTE: It has a very distant
relation. That was a trade-mark case. The
Privy Council decided that cola, being the
name of a substance, could not be trademarked by any person.
Hon. Mr. LITTLE: Fidelity is the name
of an attribute.
Hon. Mr. COTE: We are dealing now, not
with trade-marks, but with names. If we
were to apply the principle of trade-marks to
companies' names, I am afraid we should
destroy a good part of the body of our law
which regulates the exclusive rights of companies to their names.
I do not wish to take too much time in discussing this matter. I can say this about
yesterday's proceedings in the committee, that
the promoters' solicitor, a very able solicitor,
was allowed ample time to say everything that
he could say in favour of the Bill. He
acquitted himself tioroughly. The Superintendent of Insurance supported the Bill. As
was stated yesterday by the honourable
senator from Saltcoats (Hon. Mr. Calder), he
is a man for whose administrative ability we
have a great deal of respect. But I do net
know whether we should always abdicate our
own opinions on matters of law to even such
an aible official. He did say that be had no
objection te the Bill, and for the following
reason. A year ago the Saskatchewan Life
Insurance Company had applied to him for
his opinion as to the propriety of using the
name Fidelity, and at the time, without having
made any reference or given any consideration
to the fact that there was in existence a conpany called the Fidelity Insurance Company
of Canada, ho stated he had no objection to
the name being used; whereupon the Saskateisowan Life Insurance Company put
through the usual by-laws and took the usual
steps in order to secure the consent of its
shareholders and directors to the making of
this application. And Mr. Finlayson, having
once given his opinion, just stayed put. I do
net know what he thought after he listened
te the pros and cons in the committee yesterday. I know what I thought. I thought
that the committee had come te a proper
finding when they reported:
1. Your Conmittee find that the preamble of
the said Bill has not been proven to their
satisfaction.
2. Your Comnmittee have arrived at this
decision on the ground that the passage of the
said Bill would not he in the public interest.
Hon. Mr. COTÉ.

That is quite true. Similarity in the names
of two companies may lead to public confusion, and the committee said, "It is not in
the public interest to allow two important
companies to do business under names which
bear so much resemblance to each other."
The mover of this motion might have
said: "If the report is adopted, that is the
end of the Bill. The promoters having gone
to considerable expense, J would suggest that
in order te make the Bill acceptable te
the committee another name be submitted,
and for that purpose I move to have the Bill
recommitted."
There could be no possible
objection to that proposal. However, such is
not the case and I do submit that we should
net recommit the Bill for the sole reason
that the committee was not numerous. If
we do that, we shall adopt a bad precedent
and cast discredit upon the work of the conmittee. If the committee had studied this
Bill hurriedly, or declined to listen to all
the evidence, or to further evidence that
migbt be adduced, the situation would be
different. But the committee did nothing of
the kind. It listened to the pros and cons
witi great patience and keen interest; and
there were lawyers on the committee who know
something about the law regulating the riglst
to naines. It is truc the comnittee divided,
but its conclusions as contained in the report
are sound.
Personally, I am not going to support the
motion as made. If it were limited to reconmitting the Bill for the purpose of striking
out the word "Fidelity" from the fourth line
of clause one thercof. and substituîting such
other word as the committee and the piomoters might deem fit and expedient, I do
not think anyone would object. It may be
that the honourable sonator who moved the
amrendment has something like that in mind.
If he has and will say so, I shall be able
to support his motion. If net, I am afraid
I must vote against it.
Hon. Mr. McGUIRE: Honourable members.
I was glad te har the ionourable senator
(Hon. Mr. Coté) give so many good reasons
why this Bill should he reconsidered.
It
is true this comspany has gone to great expense
over a long period; it is true the Superintendent of Insurance is a remarkably capable
official, and it is true that he agrees to the
nane as proposed. Knowing Mr. Finlayson
as I do, I am certain he did not act in any
hiaphazard way, nor was ho taken unawares.
In short, I am confident he did net do anything which he had net considered deliberately.
No interests will be adversely affected if
this matter is deferred, and there is no rule
to prevent a standing committee of the Senate

MARCH 26, 1942
from reconsidering a bill. In fact it is often
done. If I were to adopt the suggestion that
the name "Fidelity" be removed now, I
should be doing the work of the committee.
I have no authority to do so, and, as I have
stated before, I wish to receive further instructions before considering the suggestion.
The argument with regard to the confusion
of names is a good argument, and should be
addressed to the committee.
Hon. Mr. COTE: It was.
Hon. Mr. McGUIRE: I am therefore asking that the Bill be referred back to the committee for further consideration after the
Easter adjournment.
Hon. CREELMAN MacARTHUR: I agree
with the honourable member from Ottawa
East (Hon. Mr. Coté) in everything he has
said. There is bound to be confusion if the
Saskatchewan Company is permitted to make
the change of name as requested. Why cannot the Saskatchewan Life Insurance Company
stick to its present title? Why does it want
to assume the name Fidelity? Is there anything so obnoxious or shameful in the name
Saskatchewan? I am rather surprised that a
man like Mr. Finlayson, so astute and capable, did not consult a list of all insurance
companies doing business in Canada. He
must have such a list. As the honourable
member from Ottawa East has said, if this
company were allowed to do business as the
Fidelity Life Assurance Company, considerable
confusion might result, for there is a Fidelity
Insurance Company already operating in
the Dominion. In fact the whole thing would
be a mess. I have no objection to the
changing of the name, but I do not think
we should take action without looking
into the list of insurance companies and making
certain that there can be no danger of
conflict or confusion. It seems to me it is a
matter for the committee to work out.
Hon. Mr. COPP: That is the motion before
us, to refer the report back to the committee.
Hon. F. B. BLACK: Honourable senators,
I am a member of the committee before
which this Bill came. I have no interest
either in the Saskatchewan Life Insurance
Company or the Fidelity Insurance Company
of Canada. I am inclined to support the
motion of the honourable member from East
York (Hon. Mr. MeGuire) to recommit this
Bill to the committee for further consideration.
In the past insurance bills have been very
largely, if not entirely, referred to the
Committee on Banking and Commerce, and
consequently the members of that committee
are perhaps somewhat more conversant with
44567-9j

131

applications of this nature. I think this Bill
should have been referred to that committee.
I recall an application made by an insurance
company to the Committee on Banking and
Commerce for a change of name. The
proposed change made it similar to the name
of another insurance or assurance company,
which opposed the application. Yet with such
able members as the late Senator Dandurand
and Mr. Meighen present, the committee
granted the application. In view of their
action I am not so much impressed by the
argument put forward by the honourable
senator from Ottawa East.
I might point out that the Superintendent
of Insurance recommended the change of
name. He told me he could see no objection
to the application. Mr. Finlayson's opinion
goes a long way with many of us who have
sat on committees and listened to his views
on insurance matters.
I recollect several bills of almost similar
nature recommended by the Banking and
Commerce Committee, notwithstanding opposition such as was presented to us yesterday.
For example, an application was made to
change the name of Imperial Underwriters
Corporation of Canada to Imperial Insurance
Officers. Objection was taken by the Imperial
Guarantee and Accident Insurance Company
of Canada and the Imperial Life Assurance
Company of Canada, but their objections
were overruled and the bill was reported
favourably. Another instance I have in mind
is an application by a Canadian company
to be incorporated as the Travellers Life
Assurance Company of Canada. The application was opposed by the Travelers Insurance
Company of Hartford on the ground that
"Travelers Insurance" and "Travellers Assurance" are similar names, but again the committee overruled the objection and recommended the passage of the bill.
It seems to me that the committee was
not thoroughly satisfied with the argument,
pro or con, for only nine members of the
committee voted. The vote was four for
and four against and the chairman cast the
deciding vote. In view of these circumstances,
I think it is only fair that we should give
the promoters of the Bill an opportunityHon. Mr. TANNER: I am entirely neutral in this matter, and I want to saySome Hon. SENATORS: Order.
Hon. Mr. TANNER:
My honourable
friend has no right to divulge the vote. I
do not care a button, but I repeat he has
no right to divulge the vote. The vote was
held at a private meeting of the committee.

SENATE
lIon. Mr. BLACK•:
If the honourable
gentleman objects, 1 apologize to the House
and to the chairman.
Anyway, under the
Hon. M.TANNER:
rules of tliih. House, when the vote is four
to four the motion is lost.
Hon. Mr. BLACK:
I will go further
and say the chairman votcd quite properly.
I do ot rare whether the company is pormitted to take the nmm Fidelity or any other
naine, but it seoms to me the reasons given
for the change are reasonable, and tbe Bill
should be referred back te the committee for
further consideration.
Hon. Mir. DONNELLY: ilonourable senators, I do flot wisb to express any opinion as
to the mnts of the Bill. Ail I desire to do
is to explain the position as I sec it. This
matter was considered before the Committee
on Miscellaneous Private Bis yesterday, in
the absence of the promoter of the Bill, and
if the cominittee's report is adopted by the
House the effect wilI be to kili the Bill. I
have a good deal of sympatliy with the viow
of the honourable memnber from ýOttawa East
(Hon. Mr. Coté) in regard to the names, but
under the circuîmstances I tliink it w'ould ho
very proper te refer the Bill back te tbe
comrnîttce.
Some Hon. SEN_ ATORS: Hear, hiear.
Hon. Mr. DO-NNELLY: If that were donc,
nobody would feel that hie had been unfairly
dealt with.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. COPP: Honourable senators, I
appreciate very mîuchi the remarks of my
honourable friend opposite. I ivas about to
say somethimg aleng the same lines. It seems
te me that the argument as to w'bat the
company shou-ld or should net do, and as te
the namne, wbilo ail very instructive, is net
relevant te the question befere the House.
If I rightly understood the motion cf the
honourable senater from East York (Hon.
Mr. MeGuire), it Ivas simply te refer the Bill
agiin te the cemmiittee for reconsideration.
The boneurable senator says an arrangement
might ho made and, if necessary, a new naine
selected whicb would ho satisfaýctory te the
company and te the country at large. It i,
net a question cf whethor the word "Fidelity"
should or should net ho usod, but of w'betbcr
or net the Bill shouid ho roconsidered.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: We are getting a
littie dayligbt on what the trouble is. Since
yesterday I have made some inquirios on my
ow'n, and I think I bave ascertained what is
the roal difficulty. Apparenitly it lies in the
fact that the namne "Fidelity," wbicb bas been
Hon. Mr. TANNER.

chosen by The Sas~katchewan Lifo Insurance
Company as it.s new namne, may lead te a
certain
ameount
cf confusion.
To my
a.stonisliment I foixnd tbat ne fewer than four
or five cempanies in Canada already make
use cf that namne. In the past. eitber hy
enactmient cf the Parliament cf Canada or
thîrougli the action cf the dopartmient, the
namne "Fidelity" bas been givon to at loast
four companies operating in this country.
Has any body oe or beard cf any confusion?
Hon. M\r. EULER: Is thero net some
qualifying adjective that distinguishes tbem?
Hon. Mr. CALDER: As in this case, the
names are net identical.
But more than tbat: there are operating in
Canada at the prescrnt time a number cf companies, I should say between twenty and
thirty, in regard te which the same kind of
confusion migýht exist. Have we heard about
any such confusion? 1 bave net, and I dou'bt
if anybody else bas.
Furthermore, 1 learned that when this comnpany made its application te the Insurance
Departmcnt or te those responsiblo for draf ting the legislation it subinitted ne fowcr than
five names. It was net tied dlown te the
one namne 'Fidelity." Se far as I have beard,
there bias net been a suggestion of any ulterior
motive; se I think we can banisb that thouglit
froým olîr minds.
As I understand the law, befoýre the namne
cf an insurance cempa;ny such as this is
adopted it must ho approved by the Governmont. Tha-t approval is given tbrough the
department, the De'puty Minister acting on
bebaîf cf bis Minister and fer tihe Governiment.
In this case the company itself wont to Mr.
Finlayson and said, "We want a ncw namne, and
bore is our sug-gestion." After consultation and,
full discussion, I understand, he approvedi the
name "Fidlelity." Well, what is the trouble
now? Lot us 'bear in mind the conditions I
bave mentioned, the past records cf companýies,
and the additional information just givon ýte us
*by the honourable senator fromn Wcstmorland
(Hon. Mr. B3lack) as te the attitude of the
Cominittee on Banking and Commerce with
regard te ùhis question. It sectms ýte me that
in theso circumstances, and in viow cf the
cemmittee's voe, the revelation cf which bas
been se strengly obýjected to by the bhonourable gentleman bebind me (Hon. Mr. Tanner),
and the fact that the promoter was net
present when the Bill was being considered,
the xvise thing for the Sonate te do would ho
to lot the committoe bave another whack ait
the Bill.
Somo Hon. SENATORS: Hear, bear.

MARCH 26, 1942
Hon. B. F. SMITH: Honourable senators, I
happen to be a member of the Committee on
Miscellaneous Private Bills. I was present
at the meeting yesterday, and after listening
to the legal arguments so clearly and forcefully advanced on both sides, I should have
found it possible to vote on either side with
a clear conscience; and so I was the one
member of the committee who refrained from
voting. The capacity of the cormpany which
my honourable friend from Ottawa East (Hon.
Mr. Coté) represents, was the only stumbling
block I had to get over. There is a possibility
that in the future the company will apply for
a licence to do a life insurance business.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: That applies to all
other companies.
Hon. Mr. SMITH: That applies ta all other
companies. I just thought I should make it
clear that I found myself in the very unenviable position I 'have described.
Hon. Mr. COTE: The honourable senator
who 'has just taken his seat made use of -the
words "the campany which my honourable
friend from Ottawa East represents." May I
say that in the committee yesterday, for the
first time in my life, I saw the caompany's
representatives. I did not know who they
were. I am not representing them. I sat
there as a member of the Senate, listening to
the discussion. I was impressed by the argument made by the opponents of the Bill, and I
must say that notwithstanding the respect I
usually have for the opinion of some honourable gentlemen who have spoken to-day I have
not yet changed my mind.
The motion was agreed to.

PRAIRIE FARM ASSISTANCE BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. J. H. KING moved the second reading
of Bill 14, an Act to amend The Prairie Farm
Assistance Act, 1939.
He said: Honourable senators, at our meeting yesterday the honourable senator from
Peel (Hon. Mr. Marshall) explained this Bill
and asked for second reading; but it was found
that the Bill was not on the files of honourable senators, and, objection being taken, the
second reading was postponed. I now move
the second reading.
Hon. J. J. DONNELLY:
Honourable
senators, I do not wish the few remarks I am
going to make to be taken as an approval of
the Prairie Farm Assistance Act, which was
passed in 1939. I thought at that time, and I
still think, it was class legislation, which it is
very hard to defend. But that is not before
us to-day. What we have before us now is
an amendment to that measure. I think the
amendment is a proper one, because when a
section bas had a total crop failure, the fact
that the price of wheat is 80 cents is no help
to the settlers there. I am quite satisfied with
the Bill.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was
read the second time.
THIRD READING

The Hon. the SPEAKER: When shall this
Bill be read the third time?
Hon. Mr. BLACK: Honourable senators,
at this morning's meeting of the Ban-king and
Commerce Committee we considered this Bill
and approved it without amendment. It was
taken up by unanimous consent of the committee, because we had present the Minister
who is in charge of the Bill. I make
this statement by way of indicating that it
will not now be necessary to send the Bill to
the committee, unless some honourable senators desire to refer it back for further
consideration.

WHEAT BONUSES AND OTHER AID
TO AGRICULTURE
INQUIRY
Hon. C. E. TANNER: Honourable members, we are living in days when the air is
vibrant with talk about the spending of
millions, hundreds of millions, and billions of
dollars.

I do not know whether we

really

think as much about these matters as we
should. I have in mind legislation which will
be passed during this session in respect to
the production of wheat and other grains in
the Western Provinces. I am not contesting
the wisdom of the policy just now; it may
be very defensible; but I am under the impression that we ought to know just what confronts us in terms of expenditure.
We are,
as I say, talking of huge sums, but I do not

MARCH 27, 1942
believe we are thinking enough about them.
Legisiation is caming through and will be
placed on the Statute Book, and 1 arn told
that it will mean flot less than 100 million
dollars to the country. 'I do flot know whether that is true or flot, but I should like to
know. In addition to that, there ie the risk
in regard to the sale of this wheat, the price
of which ie being set at 90 cents a hushel.
There ie a fear that the bass rnay be greater
in consequence of the higher price. Again
I do flot know, but I presumne the Government
knows, or has some idea of, wbat is likely to
happen. I ar n ot expecting an explanation
to-day, but shahl expect it when the Senate
resurnes after the Easter recess, and for this
reason I arn submitting the following inquiry:
1. What is the Governrnent estimate of
probable cost to the country under legislatin
they have subrnitted to Parliarrent during the
current session providing for acreage bonus
payments in respect to wheat, fiax, and other
grains and farm products; the increase to
ninety cents per bushel as fixed price of wheat;
and other expenditures, including cost of

administration, under Bill No. 12, an Act
respecting Wheat Acreage Reduction, Bill No.
13, an Act to amenci The Canadian Wheat Board
Act, 1935, and Bill No. 14, an Act to amend
The Prairie Farm Assistance Act, 1939?
2. Have the Government estirnated the probable or possible Ioss to the country ie consequence of the fixing of wheat price at nineity
cents per bush-el; and, if so, what is the
estimate?

This is one of four Bille which will corne

Hon. Mr. DONNELLY: Honourable senators, inasmuch as the rnoney asked for in this
case is to be used for national defence and
security, sornething which we ahi approve of,
I think, I for one do not intend to offer any
opposition.
Hon. Mr. MURD 0CR: Honourable senators, the Deputy of the Governor General
is not coming here before six e'clock. If
there is a chance that these Bille may be
distributed before that tirne, could we net
ad.journ during pleasure and at least look
over the Bille before we are asked te pass
tbern?
Hon. Mr. RING: I sbould be glad to pass
the honourable senator a copy of the Bill I
have here, and it wouhd not take him more
than four or five minutes te look over it.
If that is agreeable, we can proceed; te take
up the other bille. As I say, there has heen
corne delay at the Printing Bureau. We al
know it is essential that we pass these Bille
this afternoon. It wae rny hope that after
concluding our business we rnight adjourn
during pleasure, until about twenty minutes
ta six, when members of the other House
would corne over and the Royal Assent would
be given.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCR: Honourable senators, I have seen a copy of the first reading
of this Bill, and I arn entirehy in agreernent
with it. But, rightly or wrongly, a considerable number of newspaper carrespondents
and others throughout the Dominion are
taking the position that the Senate ie net
necessary under democratic conditions; that
it is only a fiftb wheel te the wagon. The
point I raise ie tbat we should net sug-gest
we are interested only in getting by with the
little work that cornes te us and týhen closing

our proper function in the interest of the
Dominion of Canada, we should neyer atternpt
te deal with a bill hefore it bas heen distributed

Hon. Mr. RING: I think the honourable
senater's pretest is sound, but I know he
dees net want te delay passage of thie
B-il. We are faniliar with the character of

senator will net object if we go ahead. I

To a very large
degree, with us it is only a matter of our
passing a supply bill, because we do not exercise the riglht of amending or changing such
a measure. Speaking for myself, I know I
never look at the details of a supply bill.
Why? Simply because I realize that even
though I might not agree with what is proposed, there is nothing we can do about it. I
say that in principle the honourable gentleman
from Parkdale is correct. Nevertheless, we
must remenber that this is a money bill, which
we cannot amend in any respect.

Hon. Mr. BLACK: I agree with the honourable senator from
Parkdale
(bon. Mr.
Murdock), who expressed disapproval of our
dealing with bills that have not been distributed. I did net object to the passing of the
first Bill, as it was a grant for national defence,
but it seems to me we should not proceed with
any other measures until they have been distributed and we have had a chance of becoming
familiar with their contents.
Hon. Mr. KING: I am now informed by
the Clerk that we shall not get these Bills
this afternoon, as they have not yet been
printed.
As I said before. there has been
some delay at the Printing Bureau. But it is
essential that we proceed with these measures.
The one before us provides for a supplementary grant to cover the ordinary expenditures of the current financial year. It is not
a large amount that is asked for, in view of
the business of this country, being a sum
not exceeding $3,530,840.
This sum
is
required to defray certain expenses, net
otherwise provided for, of various departments of the Government. A similar bill is
passed by us every session, but I think it is
usually much larger than this. I agree that
the honourable senator from Parkdale is
quite in order in the protest he has made,
and I hope it will do good. However, as the
Bills cannot be distributed this afternoon, I
hope honourable senators will accept my
explanation as sufficient.

CANADIAN

WHEAT BOARD BILL

FIRST

READING

A message was received from the House
of Commons with Bill 13, an Act to amend
The Canadian Wheat Board Act, 1935.
The Bill was read the first time.
SECOND READING

Hon. J. H. KING moved the second reading
of the Bill.
He said: Honourable senators, this is the
last of the tbrec interrelated measures that
deal largcly with Prairie conditions. The
other two, whieh have been passed, are the
Wheat Acreage Reduction Bill and the
Prairie Farm Assistance Bill.
The purpose of this Bill is to amend The
Canadian Wheat Board Act of 1935. The
amendments are very brief. Under the Act
of 1935 the price of wheat was fixed at 70
cents a bushel.
It is now proposed to
increase that price to 90 cents a bushel. The
aim of the other amendmnent in this measure
is to clarify the regulations controlling
deliveries of all kinds of grain by producers
to country clevators, loading platforms, mills,
mill elevators and terminal elevators. The
word "mills" is new. It was thought well to
insert it.
Any discussion there may be will, I think,
centre around the increase in price from 70
cents to 90 cents. As was stated in our
committee whcn the other Bills were under
consideration, it is deemed desirable that
the acreage of wheat should be controlled
and the production of the coarser grains
should be stimulated with a view to increasing the production of animal fats. It bas
also been thougbt desirable to increase the
growing of flax for the production of oil.
Although this Bill was not officially before
our committee when it met, I think it was
thoroughly discussed and inquired into at
that tie.
Mr. Gardiner, the Minister of
Agriculture, appeared before the committee
and gave us seme very useful information.
Therefore

it

seems unnecessary

dilate upon the matter.
Hon. Mr. RING.

for

me

to

Hon. J. J. DONNELLY:
Honourable
senators, yesterday we had before us in the
Standing Committee on Banking and Commerce the acreage bonus Bill, and we were
told by the Minister of Agriculture that one
of its main purposes was to prevent a great
increase in our wheat surplus. We beard
some strong arguments advanced along that
line, and a very convincing argument was
presented 'to this House by the honourable
senator
from
Lethbridge
(Hon.
Mr.
Buchanan).
But to-day we have a Bill
whicb raises the price of wheat from 70 cents
to 90 cents. If it had been the desire of the
Government to increase the wheat acreage
and bring about a greater production, nothing
I can think of would have been more helpful
for that purpose than the raising of the price
by almost 25 per cent.
I am not one of those who think we should
worry about a wheat surplus. We have, I
understand, a surplus of 400,000,000 bushels.
The surplus in the four principal wheatprodueing
countrics--the
United
States,
Canada, Australia and the Argentine-is
estimïated at, I think, 1,300,000,000 busbels.
This looks like a very large quantity; but this
war is net going to last for ever, and wien

peace cones there is going to be, I think, a

scarcit of wheat. The scorehed-earth policy
which has been followed in Europe will prevent the growing of wheat there for some
time to come, particularly in the Ukraine, and
I think we muight very well go on accurmulating
a surplus. All of it will be necded, for when
peace cones there will be a state of senistarvation in Europe. It may be said that
the countries of Europe will net be able to
buy our wheat. Even if they are not, it
would be an act of Christian charity to give it
te then, and I think it would be proper to
do so. This world will never come back to
normal conditions until the countries that have
been overrun have bad an opportunity to
recover, and we migbt help them in that way.
The Bill before us, it seems te me, is a
type of class legislation. I understand tbat
ir applies only to Western Canada, and, even
there, only to the producer of grain. We in
Ontario have crop failures, but wlien we do
we have to put up with the loss. I am not
exactly a pioneer, but in the part of Bruce
from which I come half the country was under
standing timber whben I was a boy, and we
could net get a ten-acre field that was free of
stumps. In those days the settlers had to
make good or go under. They went into the
country witb the intention of making good,
and they succeeded.
I am not entirely

MARCH 27, 1942
opposing the Bill, but I am pointing out that
Ontario may be taxed, though perhaps not
very heavily, to support it.
I think it was the member for Lambton-Kent
who gave some figures in regard to the cost
of this wheat legislation. He estinated the
expense of 90-cent wheat at $56,000,000 in
cash, the expense of the acreage bonus at
$30,000,000, and the expense in connection with
the Prairie Farm Assistance Act at $10,000,000;
a total of $96,000,000. That is not a small
sum of money. I remember the time, in 1913,
when the Government in power desired to
vote $30,000,000 to assist the Motherland in
the building of three dreadnoughts. It was
thought then that $30,000,000 was so terrible
a sum that the House of Commons was
kept sitting day and night for two weeks,
Sundays excepted, before the Bill went
through; and after it did go through the
Commons, it was killed in the Senate. Of
course I am not charging present members of
the Senate with that. I had the rather
unusual experience of voting for the Bill in
the other House, of coming here before the
Bill reached the Senate, and of voting for it
again. But it was defeated.
I do not think that what is proposed should
be a permanent policy. I think it would be
well for the Western farmers to understand
that when normal conditions return we shall
have to change our system somewhat. I think
we shall all have to learn that when a business
does not pay we must go into some other
business.
Hon. R. B. HORNER: Honourable senators, do not be alarmed. I do not intend to
go into any lengthy discussion that is likely
to stir up controversy at this time, but I do

wish to make a few remarks on this increase
in the price of wheat to 90 cents. It is well
known in Western Canada that when you
talk of 90-cent wheat you are referring to
No. 1 Northern at Fort William, and that
90-cent wheat at Fort William means an
average price to the producer of 70 cents. I
find that a number of my friends in Eastern
Canada are under the impression that we get
90 cents at the farm. The average price
received for No. 1 Northern in carload lots is
about 72 cents.
We Western farmers believe that this legislation will not necessarily impose any charge
on the Federal Government for the 1942 crop,
because millions of bushels of wheat are being
fed to live stock in Western Canada. Government statistics for 1940 show that so many
bushels remained in the bands of the farmers;
but the figures are misleading, as much of
the grain already had been fed to live stock.
For that reason the country is not likely, as
44567-1O

139

was suggested by the honourable senator who
has just taken bis seat (Hon. Mr. Donnelly),
to have to put up a very large sum of money
to assist the Western farmer.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Will the honourable
gentleman tell us where the 18-cent difference
between 72 cents and 90 cents goes?
Hon. Mr. HORNER: It goes in freight and
handling charges. That is quite simple. I
remember selling wheat for 72 cents at the
elevator, and loading by pail-there was no
loading platform-and getting 56 cents after
freight and other charges were paid. Owing
to rust or frost the grade may be low, and
before the crop comes on to the market the
Board of Grain Commissioners will decide the
spread. I have known years in which there was
a spread of possibly six or seven cents between
No. 1 and No. 2. The usual spread is from
three and a half to four cents.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: And is there the
same amount of extra cost for handling
charges, regardless of the price of the wheat?
Hon. Mr. HORNER: I think handling
charges have been somewhat reduced on street
grain; that is, for the man who bas not a
carload. They have narrowed in recent years.
There is just one comment that I have
to make. This is a personal idea, and
possibly I have expressed it before in this
Chamber. The Grain Exchange remains open
to deal with an imperishable product on the
futures market. but the facilities for marketing
live stock in Western Canada are far from
satisfactory. I maintain that if a grain exchange is useful, a live stock exhange and a
bacon exchange would be much more useful.
After all, the producer can keep bis own grain
for several months, but hogs and cattle must
be sold within a certain period of time or they
will be overweight. A good many men fed
cattle all winter in the hope of getting a fair
price for beef at this time, but if you look
at the market reports in the Western and
Eastern papers, you will see that the price
of beef is off 25 to 50 cents. These reports
say that buyers are determined to eut prices
for live animals.
We hear a great deal of talk to the effect
that the farmer does not do business as a
business man would. He is prevented from
doing so by conditions. If he had a bacon
and live stock exchange he could sell bis
animals for delivery in the spring, and he
would then be able to make a proposition to
bis banker. He would have, let us say, so
much feed on hand at home and so many
cattle; so in deciding upon whether the man
was a good risk the banker would simply
have to judge as to bis ability in the feeding

140

of stock. But under present conditions the
banker would probably say: "When you are
ready to sell your stock the market may be
off and the transaction may be unprofitable
for you. Therefore we cannot finance you."
This state of affairs prevents the using of a
great deal of grain for feeding cattle and
hogs. I do think, honourable senators, that
this is something the Government could very
well give attention to during the war. We
have government graders of grain, who render
a very satisfactory service. Abolish the live
stock markets which exist throughout the
Western Provinces to-day, put the employees
to some useful war work, appoint men to
grade cattle and hogs, have the animals
shipped on to the killing and processing plants
and let the producer receive the returns to
which he is entitled, without having deductions
made for yardage and other charges.
If you take in a load of cattle or hogs
to one of these markets-and in this respect
they are nearly all alike-they weigh all the

of that? The principal purpose, I maintain,
is to take the break of the beam from the
producer. You never get paid for any odd
pounds. If your animal weighs 874, you get
paid for 870. The stock-yards in Saskatoon.

could very well effect a great saving by
abolishing all these live stock markets, appointing a government grader of live stock and
having the animals go direct to the processing plants.
Hon. Mr. DONNELLY: With the permission of the Senate I should like to get a
little further information from the honourable acting leader (Hon. Mr. King). In 1939,
1940 and 1941 there was a fixed price for
Ontario wheat, based on Montreal. I know
a farmer up in Bruce county who when
attempting to make a sale in 1939 was told
by the buyer, "The price is 70 cents at Montreal, but we take off 23 cents for freight
rates." So we know something about freight
rates as well as the honourable senator from
Saskatchewan North (Hon. Mr. Horner) does.
At the present time there is a scarcity of
Ontario-grown wbeat for making pastry flour,
and instead of fixing a minimum price the
Government bas seen lit to put on our wheat a

ceiling of $1.26.
if this Bill goes through in its present form?
Hon. R. B. HORNER.

Nothing is said about the price at Montreal.
Will the minimum for Ontario wheat remain
at 70 cents?
Hon. Mr. SHARPE: We should be willing
to have a ceiling of $1.26 on our wheat.
Hon. Mr. DONNELLY: I am not objecting
to that. But I quoted a case to show that in
1939 a producer could not get more than the
Montreal price, less the freight rates. There
may be a surplus of pastry flour next year
and we may have to sell our wheat on the
basis of the Montreal price. I think the Bill
should provide for the same price at Montreal
as at Fort William.
Hon. A. L. BEAUBIEN: I understand that
Ontario would enjoy the same advantages as
the _West in this matter.

lon Mr. DONNELLY: There is nothing in
the Bill to provide that.
Hon. A. L. BEAUBIEN: It is in the Act
itself. The Act gives the Ontario producer
the same advantages as the Western producer.
All that this Bill does is change the figure
from 70 cents to 90 cents, which would apply
to Ontario as well as to the West.
Hon. Mr. DONNELLY: The explanation is
not quite clear. The Bill sets a minimum
price at Fort William-Port Arthur and Vancouver on wheat of grade No. 1 Manitoba
Northern, which is a grade we do not produce
in Ontario. That is the grade for which the
90 cents is being guaranteed.
Hon. A. L. BEAUBIEN: But I am sure
the Ontario farmer enjoys the same privileges.
Hon. Mr. DONNELLY: I should like to
know that the fixed price at Montreal will
be the saine as the price at Fort William.
Hon. N. M. PATERSON: Honourable senators. the Canadian Wheat Board Act, George V,
chapter 53, section 14, provides:
The provisions of this Act shall apply mutatis
mutandis to wheat produced in the Eastern
Division, and the sums certain to be paid
producers delivering such wheat shall be fixed
by the Board. . . .
I wonder if that answers the honourable
senator's question.
Hon. Mr. BUCHANAN: I understand this
90 cents is to apply only to 280 million
bushels. Any wheat produced in addition to
that will have to be sold at the market price.
Hon. Mr. KING: That is right.
Hon. Mr. DONNELLY: I think we should
clear up this point as to wbether the price
of 90 cents will apply to Ontario wheat
delivered at Montreal. There is plenty of
time to get the information.

141

MARCH 27, 1942
Hon. A. L. BEAUBIEN: The Canadian
Wheat Board Act was amended in 1939 in
order ta include Ontario wheat within its
provisions. The only change this Bill wauld
make in the Act as amended is ta increase
the price from 70 ta 90 cents.
Hon. Mr. KING: I think that is right.

Hon. A. L. BEAUBIEN: Under this Act the
price of ail grades of wheat is fixed hy the
Board at the beginning of the crop year. Our
proportion of No. 1 is nlot mare than 60 per
cent; No. 2 accounts for about 30 per cent, and
the other grades make up the remaining 10 per

Han. Mr. BLACK: Hanourable senatars, it

honourable gentleman from St. Jean Baptiste
(Han. Mr. Beaubien) may be quite correct,
but some of us are not quite sure as ta
whether this price of 90 cents applies ta any
other than Western wheat.

TUE LATE SEN-ý,ATORS RAINVILLE AND
SHARPE
TIBUTES TO THEIt AIENORY

On the Orders of the Day:

Hon. J. H. K•ING: Honourable .senators, it
is my painful duty to adixise the House that
,since our last meeting two of our distinguished
memnbrrs hav e departed this if e. I refer to
Hon. Senator Rainville, who died on April 14,
and Hon. Senator Sharpe, who died on April 19.
Senator Rainville was of French nationýaiity.
lie practised bis profession as an advocate
in the city of Montreal. He was interested
in military matters, being a lieutenant of the
85th Regiment for about ten years. ln the
provincial election of 1908 he ivas a candidate
for the Legisiature of the province of Quebec,
and in 1911 was elccted te the House of
Comînons. In 1917 he was again a candidate
for election te the House of Gommons, but
wvas not returned. Hie became Chairman of
the Montreal Harbour Commission in 1930,
and sers ed until 1932. He was surnmoned to
the Senate in October, 1932.
We ail know that Senator Rainville was a
regular attendant in this assembly and took
a considerable part in our discussions. Having
an intinmate knowledgc of conditions in the
harbour of Montreal, he conceived that, it
would be advantageous flot only to that great
harbour, but to) the people cf Canada, that
a free port should be established in that
locality. He mnade bis representations in this
Chambcr and1 succeeded in baving a, special
commnittee of this House appointed to inquire
into the advisability of adopting a policy of
frec ports in Canada. I was a member of that
comnmittee, and 1 may say tbat thanks te
the efforts of Senator Rainville much valuable
information was elicited. Honourable gentiemen who were members cf the committee will
recaîl that our discussions were cf great
intcrest and that the men wbo appeared before
us gavec us an insight into the free ports establisliîd elsew here, particularly in countries cf
Europe, ami showed bow well they were serving those countries. Oniy to-day I was thinking that the trail blazed by the honourable
senator is one that we migbt foliow wben tbis
w-ar is brought, te a successfui conclusion and
normal trade conditions are re-establisbed
tbroughout the worid. His proposai wiii then
be w'ortby of our consideration.
May I express my deepest sympathy with
bis relatives and associates in bis passing.
The Hon. Senator Sharpe was born ini the
province cf Ontario. Hie eventually establisbed himseif in Manitou, Manitoba, where

MAY 5, 1942
he had a general store and identified himseli
with the municipal affairs of the community.
He was a councillor af the village of Manitou
for six years, and was mayor in 1908.
H1e was active in the last war. H1e raised a
battalion, the 184tb, and took it to England.
In 1904 lie suffered defeat in an attempt to
become a member of the flouse of Commons,
but he was elected to that Chamber in 1908,
and re-elected in 1911. H1e resigned from the
buse of Commons in 1915 to become a
candidate for the Legisiature af Manitoba. H1e
was sumnmoned to the Senate on February 10,
1916. lis personality and gen.iality gained him
the friendship and respect of bis associates.
11e took an active part in the proceedings of
this Chamber, and the work lie did in our
committees was particularly valuahle.
is
clearness of thought and expression was mucli
appreciated. I desire to express my sincere
sympathy to the members of his family and
to bis associates.
Hon, C. C. BALLANTYNE: Honourable
senators, during the last few mantbs the Grim
Reaper bas taken a very heavy toîl of the
members of this Chamber: seven in ail. Even
since we last ýadi ourned, two of our outstanding colleagues have passed away, iii the persons of Senators Sharpe and Rainville.
Senafror Sharpe, as we ail are aware, was a
very valuable member of this Chamber for
twenty-six years. His wide connection with
and experience in Western affairs, and, later
in lufe, bis familiarity with business, enahled
bim ta render service of a very bhigli order.
As the honaurable leader (Hon. Mr. King) has
so truly stated, bis advice was indeed appreciated, flot only wben lie spoke an the floor
of this Chamber, but àlso in committee. It
can be said of Senator Sharpe that be was
really a pioneer. Very early in life lie left bis
native province of Ontario and went to Manitoba. Tbat was fifty-odd years aga, when
ta go aut ta tbe West was extremely difficult
and arduous. It bas been related that when
Senator Sharpe first wen.t out there be drove
ta bis section or quarter-section of land with
a pair of oxen. Owing to bis belief in the
West and in bimself, and because of bis dogged
perseverance, lie made a success of farming.
In tbose days if a Western farmer liad a
partial crop failure or a total crop failure, it
was of no use for bim to look to Ottawa in
the hope of baving tbe price af wheat fixed, or
of being given a bonus sucli as is granted taday. The hardy pioneers of that periad had
ta sink or swim, relying solely upon their own
initiative and liard work. After making a
success of farming, Senator Sharpe started

business in bis adopted town. H1e continued
fori' nany years in that business, wbicb also
proved ta be bighly successiul.
Senator Sharpe, as the bonourable leader ol
the flouse (Hon. Mr. King) bas stated, bac.
an outstanding and remarkably cbarming personality. lie was liked and rcspected by
cvcrybody wbo bad tbe good fortune ta know
bim. In bis borne town, as we sa well know,
bis fellow-citizens made bim one ai its cauncillors and tben its mayor. Hie was twice
elected ta the flouse of Commons.
Senator Sbarpe's record is one of which bis
iamily and bis friends can be truly proud. Ta
bave a bost af friends and fia enemies is certainly a great personal tribute, and bis reputation is -one ai tbe legacies wbicb the late
senator bas leit ta bis family.
I join with tbe bonourable leader ai tbe
Huse in expressing flot only my awn personal
sympatby, but tbe sympathy af ail tbose an
this side ta Mrs. Sharpe and tbe members af
ber family in their great loss.
Senator Rainville was one af Quehec's outstanding citizens, proud ai bis province, bis
race and bis creed, and lie bad every reason
ta lie proud ai tbem. Successful in law, lie
later turned bis attention ta mining, and, I
understand bis efforts in tbat direction were
also bighly successful.
Our late colleague was not a man ta confine bis abilities ta bis native province: lie
applied tbem ta the wbole Dominion, knowing Canada in the most familiar way from.
one acean ta the other. On bis election ta
the flouse ai Commons in 1911 ta represent the
electoral district ai Cbambly-Verchères, bis
abulities were soon recognized, and at the
instance ai the then Prime Minister, Riglit
Hon. Sir ]Robert Borden, lie was made Deputy
Speaker. Hie was nat successful in tbe Union
Government electian ai 1917. But I will say
tbis ai Senator Rainville: be remained true
ta the traditions ai the Conservative party and

SENATE

I arn sure that I arn expressing the keen
regret cf every honourable member when I
say bow mucb Senator Rainvifle wj]l be
missed in this House. It is truly to be
regretted that, as I said at the opening of
my rernarks, so many of our useful and
experienced senators have passed to the
Great Beyond.
But Senator Rainville-in
common with Senator Sharpe-bas left behind
hirn a record that must be a source of pride
for bis famiiy, bis province and bis country.
We ail join with the honourable leader and
those on the other side of the House in expressing our deepest sympatby with Madame
Rainvilie and the members of ber family.
Hon. A. D. MdRAE: Honourahie senators,
it is with great sorrow that I rise to pay tribute
to two of my best frieods in this Charniber
wbo have left us since we last met. As the
shadcws lengthen for most of us, the removal
of very dear friends cannot fail to impress
on us the frailty of human lifo, the uncertainty
of existence.
Senator Sharpe I had known for many years
before the first war, and it was my good
fortune on comiing to the Senate to have a
room adjoining bis. For ton years we had
very close association, and I want to pay
this tribute to bim, a tribute of whicb any
man might well be proud: Senator Sharpe
was a Christian gentleman and at aIl times
endeavoured to live up to the doctrines of
bis oburch.
Net one in ton ye'ars cao I
remember that the Colonel ever said an
unkind word about anone. He bad a marvellotis personalil 'v. Deep iii bis leart svas love
of bis fellow-men and a warm appreciation
of cver 'v niember of this bononiable House.
Jo bis long, careeer Scoator Sharpe bad
pros en bis usefulness to Canada. In my own
case I found lus guidance, bis judgment and
bis kindoesses most beipfui.
Tbiat debt I
now wisb to acknowledge.
Seoator Rioxille was aIse a personal friend
of mine. Probably I had no botter friend
froma the province of Quehec than Joe
Rainville.
1 learncd to admire ins very
mucbi. His lo3yalty was never open to question. His vision extended bcyood biis ow'n
province; bis interest wvas Donainionwide. Ho
svas anxious about our duial oationality, and
I remember tbe last time I met him he
spent an bour witb me deploring oaisuoderstandiogs betweeo our French and Eng-lish
sections, and urging on me the prime importance cf giviog oui- Eoglish-speaking, press
a better understanding of the situation in
Quebec in order te bring about doser national
unity. Tliat was tbe uppermost thougbt in
bis mind. He sNas a Canadian whose uutluok
one might well ho prend te share.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE.

I do not expect that for a long time any
heroavement of my personal friends wiIl
affect me more poignantiy than the ioss of
Senator Sharpe and Senator Rainvilie, and I
oniy wisb I could do fuît justice to the many
fine qualities cf botb my departed friends.
Hon. G. V. WHITE: I desire to associate
myseif with bonourable senators who have
preceded me in expressing the loss wbich the
Senate bias sustained in the departure of
two of or distinguished colleagues.
Tbe sudden demise of Senator Rainville
was, I arn sure, a sbock te us aIl. Joe
Rainville was in bis seat just prier te the
Easter adjouroiment and at that time appeared
te be in bis usual good health.
Hie occupied a promineot position hoth in
the life of bis native province and cf the
Dominion as a whoie. As bas aiready been
said, hoe became a member cf the House cf
Commons in 1911, representiog at that time
the constituency of Chbamhly-Vercb ères. In
1930 bie was appointed te the cbairmansbip
of the Montreai Harbour Commission, an
office wbich he vacatcd in 1932 on beingsummoned te this Cbamber.
As the bonourable leader cf tIse Sonate bas

MAY 5, 1942
We have heard something of Senator
Sharpe's war record. Feeling that it was a
duty to serve his King and bis country, he
offered ta raise in lis own district a battalion
for overseas service, and 1 think I can say
without fear of contradiction that he recruited
the 184th Battalion in record time. Although
neyer previously associated with the military
life of this country, he made a wonderful
record for bimself by the way in which he
raised that battalion. 11e took it ta Bngland,
and it was afterwards sent over ta France.
Mention bas been made of the fact that
Senator Sharpe was identified with the industrial life of this country. I arn happy ta
say that some of his interests turned out
very fortunately. My acquaintancesbip with
Senator Sharpe extended over some thirtyfour years, during which period we became
intimate friends. In bis. passing I feel very
keenly the loss af a warm friend and an
associate of long standing. I wish ta extend
t, Mrs. Sharpe and the farnily my personal
sympathy.
Hon. JOHN T. HAIG: Hon ourable memfbers, as one af the senators whom we are
rernembering to-nigbt was frorn tbe province
af Manitoba, I tbink I sbould be derelict in
my duty ta tbat province if I did nat say a
few words.
Since the last sitting of tbis House we
have lost twa of aur bonourable members.
As kind references have been made ta them
by the leader of the Government, tbe leader
af the Opposition, and otber members on
this side ai the Huse, it would be superfiuous for me ta attempt ta add anytbing ta
the historical record.
On this occasion, at. such a time as this
through which we are passing, it is a wholesome thought for us ail ta rernember that
our late colleagues were great, representatives
of the twa races in Canada. 1 think tbat
to-night, if I were able ta pierce the veil
of the place wbere we tbink men go after
they bave lived good lives, I sbould see
Joe Rainville and Billy Sbarpe sitting together, looking dawn at us and wondering,
"What would those boys say if we were
down there?" Tbese two men were af tbe
same temperament, and were friendly witb
eýach other. Eacb was an outstanding representative of bis race. Maybe tbey were flot
the greatest intellectual giants of aur country,
nar the greatest arators or parliamentarians
in aur history; but, pianeers bath, builders
bath, they represented tbe best in aur country.
Senator Rainville, wbase lot was cast in
thie great city of Mantreal, made, as tbe
leader of tbe Government bas said, a contri-

145

bution ta tbe future of aur country. It may
be alsa that be contributed ta the solution
of one af the prablems which we shaîl bave
ta face after the war. He bas left a record
on tbe pages of parliamentary bistary af
whîch any man born in the province of
Quebec and speaking the French language
might well be proud.
I pay my special respects ta Senator Sbarpe
because he was a great representative of tbe
Anglo-Saxon people of tbis country. He was
a pianeer, a business inan, a good fellow.
H1e went ta tbe province of Manitoba as a
very young man and entcred the implement
business in Douglas. H1e tben rnoved ta,
Manitou, wbere be established a record
as a
great farmer and business man. Later he
carne ta Parliament, where be spent thirtyfour years, and in bath the House of Cornmons and tbe Senate be'left bebind hirn a
very fine record.
Senator Sharpe's farnily, whorn I know
personally-bis wife, bis son and his daugliter
-ave
the happy knowledge that their husband and father contributed much ta the
welfare of Canada. We frorn Manitoba pay
ta hirn our meed of praise: we think tbat be
truly represented in Ottawa the men and
wamen of aur province.
As was said by the bonourable senatar frorn
Vancouver (Hon. Mr. Mcbae), bath of these
men were Christian gentlemen. I rnay say
quite candidly ta, this Chamber that I do not
knaw which rnan's record wauld be the
greater. Each made an important contribution ta aur country, and in tirnes ta corne
we shaîl need mare men witb their foresigbt.
To the families af aur two departed calleagues are extended, I arn sure, the condolences af nat only tbe members of this
bouse, but also a legion of friends outside af
Parliament.
Hon. EUGENE PAQUET (Translation):
We regret having ta bring ta the attention af
this IRouse the <lecease of Senators Sharpe and
Rainville. The loss ai my aid and goad
iriend, Senator Rainville, grieves me deeply.
I sbould like ta emphasize at this time a trait
of bis character: bis love ai educatian. and
bis constant efforts ta bring about a happy
solution ai our social problems. Senatar
Rainville passed away suddenly at bis
borne in St. Larnbert, at the age af sixtyseven. Lawyer, business man, actively engaged in politics, the late Senator Rainville
had many friends in ahl walks of lufe. Neyer
have I met anyone wbo worked more assiduously. His life was a full one, and bistary
will say that be was one ai Canada's mast
distinguished sans. Those af us wbo were bis

146

SENATE

colleague- in the House of Commons thirty
years- go will rcmemiber his energy and
activity. 1efeted a first time, le succeeded
in gaining a seat in 1911, and at the federal
election of 1930 became chief organizer of
his party in Quebec. His reputation as an
able administrator placed him in line for the
important position of chairman of the Montreal Harbour Board.
Our beloved collcague always endeavoured
to bring out into the open the social injustices
be cane across. As someone bas well said,
"To serve was for him the highest of buman
motives, and he practised what le preached,
by devoting ail his efforts to the defence of
the cause be bad espoused."
Hon. Mr. Rainville's career stands out as
a model for our youth and for all Canadians
who love their country. In 1911, our late
friend achieved a great victory over one of
our most brilliant political men.
His remarkable qualities brought bicm to
tc attention of the Conservative leaders, who
asked him to head their organization in the
promince of Quebce. Our friend was equal
to the task, and his endeavours were progressively greater as the field became more
difficult.
Senator Rainville revealed himself to be an
indefatigable worker. He belonged to the
most enterprising and energetic type of men.
To the families of the late senators I wish
to offer my most heartfelt sympathy. I am
sure that all honourable members of the Senate
share my feelings in this respect. In bereaving
us of our colleagues the Grim Reaper bas
struck down two great Canadians who loved
us all dearly.
Hon. L. COTE: Honourable senators, a
number of our colleagues have already reviewed the careers and praised the qualities
of the late Senators Sharpe and Rainville, and
well expressed our sense of loss at their
departure from our midst. In fact, those
feelings, whicb I fully share, have been so
well expressed tbct I hesitate to add anything. Nevertheless, I do wish te state, as
briefly as I can, how Senator Joseph Rainville appeared to me across the many years,
more than twenty-five, that I had the honour
of knowing him. He was a typical son of
Quebec, an idealist, a dreamer, a chaser of
the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow,
a lover of music and art, and had withal a
mind keen and clear, vivacious and active.
He was truly French to the very marrow of
his bones.
As has been stated by other senators, be
was deeply attached to, loved and was proud
of his racial inheritance. And I know that
be had delved into the story of the romance
Hon. Mr. PAQUET.

of its survival in Canada. I remember that
some yecars ago Senator Rainville delivered
in the Academie Hall of the University of
Ottawa a lecture of high literary quality, at
whici time be related an incident explanatory
of the survival of that inheritance. He told
his audience how after the cession of Canada
by the French king, a school teacher of Three
Rivers, who possessed the only French grammar in the city, used te teach that subject
to his pupils by placing the treasured book
on a reading desk to which they would come,
one at a time, and, without touching it,
lest it be damaged, read the lesson of the
day, a lesson on the rules of a language which,
as was said by a great orator in the other
House at the time of the last war, lias the
limpidity of spring water and the strength
of tempered steel-a language whieh our late
colleague spoke admirably.
But Senator Rainville was not only French.
He was a Canadian of French descent, who
knew and remembered the history of this
country. He remnembered tbat in 1775 French
Canadian swords, which had been dormant
since the days of Ticonderoga and of the
Plains of Abraham, leaped from their scabbards in order that Canada might remain
British; and be remembered that by that
(leed his native proince ceased to be se much
ceded territory, because its inhabitants liad
exercised the right of self-determination,

and

that thencefortb they were Canadians who
claiied all the rights of Canadian citizenship
and a-sumed their full share of the duties
wlin- are the price of those rights.
In 1917 Mr. Rainville was a member of the
House of Commons and be stood for reelection in his riding of Chambly-Verchères.
He supported the Goverrnment of the day,
and in that riding of Chambly-Verchères be
advocated and supported compulsory military
service. In doing that be did a sincere and
brave thing. I think that as be entered that
electoral conflict there must have come te
his lips the prayer which in olden days candidates for knighthood in France used to say
on the eve of their investiture, when they
went to churcb to have their swords blessed.
The words of that prayer, which I read the
other day in an old book in my home, have
so actual and poignant an appeal in these days
when our own Canadian airmen, sailors and
soldiers are giving the world sucb noble
examples of gallantry and sacrifice, that I
will read them to the House:
Almigbty God, You hold balanced in Your
hands the shafts of victory and the fulminations
of celestial anger. Deign from the beight of
Your glory to look upon him who has come
within Your temple to perform the duty of

MAY 5,1942
haviaig his sword blessed and consecratcd; flot
ta serve injustice and tyranny, nat ta plunder
and destray, but ta defand the Throne and the
laws, ta free all those who suifer and groan
under the whip of the oppressors. Therefore
give unto bim, ta enable him to perfarmn that
sacreri mission. the wisdom of Solamon and
the strength of the Maccabees.
"To defand the Tbrona and the laws, ta free
aIl those who suifer and groan under the wbip
of the apprassors." Such was the teaching of
ancient cbivalry and sucb was the spirit of
our late colleague. In that political campaign
of 1917 ha lost bis seat, and fifteen yaars
passed bafore bie again appeared in Parliamant,
baving antered through tha portaIs of this
House. However, ha bad accaptad dafeat witb

dictates of his conviction. In the book of bis
life, which is now closed, those things remain.
writtan, an inspiration ta ail of us wbo may,
at timas, for reasons of personal interest or
tbrough mare fatigue in the struggle, be tempted ta falter in aur task.
Our late colleagua's body will become integrated with the soul of bis dear homeland. This
is as hie would have it. And hae will anjoy
that etarnal peace wbich bis ancestral faitb

H1e also leavas bis fathar, who bias -lived ta a
ripe aId age ta find bonaur, consolation and
camfort in the son bie begot. To bis father
and ta that disconsolata but brave woman, bis
widaw, I am sure aur condolences go in the
fullest measure.
Hon. E. MICHENER: Honourable snembars, we bave heard the acting leaders on bath
sides of the House and other honaurabla members give us a résumé of the public service
of aur two colleaguas, the late Senators Sbarpe
and Rainville, wba have passed since we last
mat. It is givan ta few men ta serve se long
and se, continuously as did Sanator Sharpa.
Distinguisbed though bis public service was,
it is nat my intention ta repeat what lias been
said in that regard. I wish only ta give expression ta a few thougbts in memory of a friendslip witb Senator Sharpe of more than, twenty
yaars.
Some time ago I was taken with a stroka,
and it was not axpectad I would recaver.
Sanator Sbarpe came ta see me. Whan hie said
good-bya, I said ta bim, "Say a few kind
words." Little did I think it would be my
oppartunity ta say a few words ini tribute ta
bis memary. H1e bad a great cbarm of personal quality that radiated goodwill ta, everyone. H1e was of a ganial disposition. Honourabla members will readily recaîl the cheerful
greetings wbich lie gave f rom time ta, tima

147

upon entering this Chamber. H1e was always
calm and possessed of good cheer, through al
the vicissitudes of life. I was associated wjth
him in many ways for some twenty years, and
I neyer knew bim to be different. Wbatever
happened, he was philosophical. H1e accepted
fate as it came, and looked for the best. H1e
had a hopeful outlaak on life, which is a great
asset to any man. 11e looked flot only on the
briglit side of things and the world in general,
but also an the good side of bis fellow men.
Like the hanourable senatar from Vancouver
(Hon. Mr. McRae). 1 cannot recail that Senator
Sharpe ever made any unkind criticismn of anyone, whether a political friend or enemy. That
is a tribute whicéh, I fear, same of us would
flot deserve.
Senator Sharpe had withal a sense af humour,
which,' added to his other charming qualities,
made up his personality. As a friend hie was
always the samne. Whatever came along, hie
kept the even tenar cf bis way. 11e always
maintained a peaceful. trustful, kîndly attitude
ta life in general and to people in particular.
In vacations quite frequently hie and I were
associated in outings together, and we had
many pleasant journeys. I recali one Easter
holiday when we tank a trip together ta California, and in many other places we had
pleasurable times. Again like the honourable
gentlemen from Vancouver, 1 had a great
respect for Senator Sbarpe's qualities of mind
and he.art, wbicb neyer changed.
To-night, I do not think of him as dead. In
the words of Longfellow:
There is no Death! What seems SO is
transition;
This if e of mortal breath
Is but a suburb of the if e elysian,
Whose portal we call Death.
H1e bas but graduated from this material life
ta that bigher life which we are told is mare
abundant and is eternal.
Senator Sharpe has left behind a son and
daughter and a devoted wife. To the end, as
tbroughaut bis life, there were no camplaints.
and he seemed to find great comfort towards
the last in the fact that bis family were at
bis side. Tbey will surely miss a cheerful and
affectionate parent. H1e will also be missed
by bis many friends, but tbe memory of friendships which. bave lasted tbrough the years will
neyer die.
As I see one after another of my friands pass
on, I find some comfert in the inspiring linas
of tbe Quaker poat Whittier:
And when at last upon liie's play
The curtain f alls, I only pray
That Hope shaîl lose itself in Truth,
And age in Heaven's immortal youth.
My syrnpathy goes eut ta hie loved ones and
ta bis intimata friends in their bereavement.

148

SENATE

Hon. L. M. GOUIN: Honourable senators,
as a member on this side of the House, I too
wish to pay tribute to the late Senator
Rainville, whom I knew for at least twenty-five
years. He was indeed a very good friend of
all the members of my family, and my relations wi.th him were always most pleasant and
most charming.
From time to ýtime we used to meet and,
putting aside our political differences of
opinion, we would have long talks about our
national problems, and thus, as we say in
French, de cette modeste façon, nous essayions
de sauver le pays: we were in this modest
way trying quite earnestly to save our country.
The main topic of our conversation used to
centre around co-operation between our two
great races as it would affect the future of
Canada. He took a deep interest in such
questions.
Senator Rainville was also remarkably well
acquainted with our economic conditions, and,
as is well known, his addresses on the St.
Lawrence waterways were carefully prepared
and authoritative.
He knew intimately the country people of
Quebee, the good habitants, and also the
settlers in our colonization outposts. He was
a philosopher who knew how to smile-un
philosophe qui savait sourire. Happy on a
farm, he was happier still in the bush, or in
a yacht or canoe, hunting or fishing, for he
was an excellent sportsman.
Our late friend deeply loved his country
and had at heart the welfare of his race. He
was rager to promote peace and harmony with
our English-spealing fellow-countrymen, and
also with our great American neighbours.
Senator Rainville was a man of goodwill, and
lis friends will always remember him as a perfect gentleman whose greatest satisfaction was
ta be of service to others and to make all
those around him as happy as possible.
BUSINESS OF THE SENATE
lion. Mr. KING: Honourable senators, I
regret to say that our Order Paper is blank,
and that there are no messages from the

the measures engaging its attention are related
to Canada's war effort, and many of them are
now before its select or special committees.
I understand that we shall have some business before two of our committees next

WORK OF THE SENATE
DISCUSSION

Hon. J. H. KING: Honourable senators, I
have a statement which I wish to make to
the Senate.
I think you are all familiar
with the attitude of the late Right Honourable Senator Dandurand in regard to the
place in Parliament occupied by the Senate.
He had the idea, in which, I believe, many
of us concur, that this House as constituted,
although its members come from both political parties, is not really a partisan body. His
opinion-and I think it was in accordance
with the views of most of the Prime Ministers
of Canada-was that we should be a reviewing body. I may say truthfully that during
the twelve years I have been in this House
I have never until yesterday attended a
political conference of my party. Yesterday
we had a meeting, and that is why I wish
to speak now.
Our group met for the
purpose of considering our position in the
Senate, realizing, as we all do, the loss of the
distinguished leadership we had under the
late Right Honourable Senator Dandurand
and Right Honourable Mr. Meighen, who
has retired from his place in this House. We
know that the earnestness and activity of
these two distinguished leaders made it
possible for the others of us to rest on our
oars; in other words, we were inclined to
"let George do it." Now that they have
left this House. it has occurred to us that
thmere probably is an opportunity for members
of the Senate to do more work than we have
been doing. There is an opinion abroad that
senators have no work to do. It is not so.
We are here in Ottawa, in touch with the
House of Commons, where most of the legislation originates, and we have the facilities,
the opportunity and, I think, the duty to study

MAY 7, 1942
Government resolutions and bis, to listen
to the debates, and ta read Hansard and the
reports of committees. I arn sure that if we
as individuais will give attention and study
to these matters, as I deem, it, our duty to
do, our discussions in this Chamber wilI lie
freer and lietter, and aur work more effective.
I make this statement so that our confrères on the other side may understand that
the object of the members of aur party in
meeting yesterday was ta try ta, arrange their
affairs so that they miglit be hetter advised
as ta the activities of and the legisiation coming
from the other Huse, ta. the end that aur
activities should lie af greater interest and
usefulness.
Hanaurable
Hon. C. C. BALLANTYNE:
senatrs-(Hon. Mr. Ballantyne, who was reeently
chasen Leader of the Conservative party in
the Senate, was greeted with applause.)
Thank you ail very mucli. I will say only
this in reference ta yaur kind, generous and
unexpected applause, that yau will find a very
great difference between my leadership and
that of my brilliant predecessor. To my
hanaurable friends opposite 1 should like ta
express an assurance such as I gave ta my
awn colleagues yesterday, that with their
assistance I will do the very best I can. No
one can do better than his best. And let
me say once more that I greatly appreciate
the kind applause you were good enaugh
ta give me.
I rase ta say that I find myseif fully in
agreement with the remarks just made by
the lionourable leader of the bouse (Hon.
Mr. King). The Senate of Canada was constituted for the purpose that lie has outlined.
But different Prime Ministers follow different
palicies in delegating ta this Hause work
that it is prepared and welI able ta do. I
arn speaking now of peace times. When Riglit
Honourable R. B. Bennett was Prime Miný
ister, the Senate haci very few adjourminents.
As ahl honourable senatars are aware, legislation can lie initiated in this House as well
as in the other. With no reflection upon
the ather House, of which I myself was once
a member, I want ta, say this in favaur of the
Senate: that it is a non-palitical body, and
legislation is handled here, nat anly an the
floar of the House, but also ini aur committees, in a more efficient way than it is by aur
They must of
friends in another place.
necessity keep their eyes an political considerations, ta a certain extent, as we need
flot do. I know that in war times we canflot expect that a large number af bills will
lie initiated in the Senate, mast of tbem being

149

war measures. Nevertheless, same bills which
are initiated la the Commons could just as
well lie deait with here first, and we shauld be
glad indeed ta have them. I would say ta
my honourable friend the leader of the bouse
that I hope he will continue ta press the
Prime Minister and the Government ta
expedite legislation in the other Hause so
that it may reach us promptly. The public,
having no praper understanding or appreciatian of this Chamber, entertain the erroneaus
ides that the Senate is of littie or no use.
If they khew the facts they would certainly
have an entirely different opinion. This misunderstanding would lie cleared up if mare
legisîstion reached us. For the short time
lie lias occupied bis present position the acting
leader lis done extremely well ini bis efforts
ta effect an improvement, and I would urge
him ta continue ta work ta this end.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
ban. A. D. McRAE: Honourable senators,
I cancur in the remarks of the honourable
acting leader of the House (Han. Mr. King).
There are many people throughout Canada
who feel that this House should liusy itself in
inquiring into and considerîng the problems
which wilI surely face the cauntry wlien the
war is over. This would lie purely a nonpolitical effort.
Ini this cannection I have in mind what was
done by what I may term a self-appointed
committee of members from bath sides af
the bouse when, a few years ago, as same
honourable senators will recall, we gatliered at

Hon. Mr. MeRAE: Our Banking and Commerce Committee is the best judicial committee in Parliament, and is se recognized by those

MAY 7, 1942
Hon. A. C. HARDY: Honourable senators,
it is not my intention to attempt to controvert anything which has been said by my
friend to my left (Hon. Mr. Murdock). We
all know how to take him.
I want first to convey, in a very few words,
my personal congratulations to the honourable
senator who has just been promoted to the
important post of leader on the other side of
the House (Hon. Mr. Ballantyne).
Hon. Mr. DUFF: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. HARDY: He has taken this
important position at great personal sacrifice,
and I know that his action is appreciated on
this side of the House just as much as it is
on the other side.
In referring to what the leader on this side
(Hon. Mr. King) has said, I do not intend to
go into detail or to take up much time. One
thought has occurred to me, not only because
of the lack of work before us this session,
but also by reason of our procedure in various
debates over a number of years. When I first
entered this House, twenty years ago, we
used to deal fully with many bills, especially
public bills, in Committee of the Whole; but
for probably the last ten years-I do not want
to set any limit one way or the other-the one
object of this House has seemed to be to
finish its work as quickly as possible, and I
do not think it can be controverted that
on giving bills the first and second readings
we have immediately referred them to a
standing committee. Some bills must go to
standing committees, of course, but many bills
that have gone to standing committees should
have been dealt with in Committee of the
Whole.
If I have the permission of the House I
would refer, though it may be contrary to the
rules to do so, to one instance that occurred
this session. I have in mind the way in which
we dealt with the treaties with the South
American republics. You will remember that
the bills concerning them were referred to
the Committee on Banking and Commerce.
They were Government bills of outstanding
interest to anyone having the welfare of the
country at beart and desiring to know something of what was going on. I was not present
at the hearing before the Banking and Commerce Committee, but I understand a great
deal of enlightening information was brought
out there. None of that, however, was
reported to this House; there was merely a
report from the committee approving of the
treaties. The matter was dealt with in a
treaties. The matter was dealt with in a
summary way, and prabably from a business
the public know anything about what these
treaties mean? They came to us after a brief

151

debate in the other House. We had an
opportunity, had we wished to take advantage
of it, to discuss them in detail in Committee
of the Whole, and thereby make a great deal
of valuable information available to the
country. But we did not take advantage of
that opportunity. I refer to this instance only
because it is a recent one. The same kind of
thing has been going on for a good many years.
I should like to suggest to honourable
senators that every public bill coming before
us should, unless there is a very strong reason
for referring it to a standing committee, be
considered by the Senate in Committee of the
Whole. That procedure would not only give
us work to do-which perhaps is not of transcendant importance, for the chief consideration is to see that measures are properly
bandled-but it would also be a means of
keeping the public better informed on the
character of the legislation passing through
this House, and the care with which it is
attended to. We do know that throughout
the country there is a strong and growing feeling that th. Senate does very little, that our
members, especially those who live at Ottawa
or not very far away, are mainly interested in
getting through with their work as quickly as
possible and then going home. Consideration
of public bills in Committee of the Whole
would resul.t in our work being given more
publicity in the Press, particularly in the local
press, which now pays no attention at all to us.
I make these remarks by way of suggestion
only.
Fron time to time we hear suggestions as to
means of increasing our work and at the same
time relieving the House of Commons of some
of its work, especially with regard to bills that
need to be considered in committee. I fully
agree with the purpose behind these suggestions, as I am sure every honourable senator
does. But of course there is involved the
question of what measures may be properly
initiated in the Senate, and what ones the
elected representatives, who have certain
responsibilities to their constituents, may find
it convenient to have initiated here. These
are matters that may be brought up and discussed at any time in due course.
I want to corroborate what the honourable
leader of the House (Hon. Mr. King) has said
about meetings of senators who sit on this
side. In the twenty years during which I have
been a senator I have attended only one
caucus, which was the only one held in all
that time. If we continue along this line we
ought to be able to keep free of political bias.
We are now making a fresh stant, as it were,
with two new leaders, though I do not think
that anyone could accuse the late Right Hon-

152

SENATE

ourable Senator Dandurand, who was our
leader for so many years, of carrying political
affairs into this Chamber. I am only too
glad to pay tribute to the Right Honourable
Mr. Meighen also, for the way in which he
acted during his period of leadership here.
For most of that time he was supported by a
very large majority, but he carried on in a
very fair and open way, and I never had any
complaint to make in that respect.
Hon. J. A. CALDER: Honourable senators,
I should like to make reference to the last
remarks of the honourable senator from Leeds
(Hon. Mr. Hardy), about caucuses of members
of this Chamber. Members on this side of
the House have had frequent caucuses. After
all, why is a caucus held? It is not for any
political purpose, but to analyse some of the
measures that come before us and to ascertain what our varions viewpoints are. It is
not for the purpose of having a united party
stand one way or the other.
Hon. Mr. HARDY: I did not say that that
had been done on the other side.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: I know. But the honourable gentleman intimated it.
Hon. Mr. HARDY:
intimation at all.

No, I made no such

Hon. Mr. CALDER: The honourable gentleman intimated something about political
caucuses, though he did not use just those
words. I have been a member of this House
for twenty years and have attended virtually
every caucus held in that time. Let me say
that I have never heard a suggestion, either
from a leader or any other member, that
those of us on this side of the House should
act politically. Do I make myself clear?
Hon. Mr. HARDY: Does the honourable
senator say that I even intimated such a
thing?
Hon. Mr. CALDER: No, not at alil.
Hon. Mr. HARDY: Then, don't read me a
lecture, please.
Hon. Mr. CALDER:
you on that point.
Hon. Mr. HARDY:
know what this is.

I am not lecturing
Then I should like to

Hon. Mr. CALDER: What I say is this,
that since I have been here there never has
been a time when every member on this
side of the House has not been free to judge
every question before us on its merits.
Hon. Mr. HARDY:

Certainly.

Hon. Mr. CALDER: I say that definitely
and clearly. I well remember the caucus
Hon.

Mr. HARDY.

which was held when the late Mr. Willoughby
was appointed leader on this side. He said
at that time, "I want it clearly understood
by every member present that I shail at al]
times be free to express my opinion on any
public question as my conscience guides me."
That is the attitude which has always been
taken by members on this side of the House,
and I leave it to any honourable member
over here to say if that is not se. I say this
because our dear late friend Senator Dandurand prided himself on the fact that you
senators opposite never held a caucus. You
would be better off if you did hold caucuses;
not political caucuses, but caucuses to discuss
the principles and merits of bills coming
before us.
Some Hon. SENATORS:

Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. CALDER: For goodness' sake, let
us hear no more about caucuses. I repeat
that all the caucuses that have been held
on this side of the House since I became
a senator have been non-political.
I agree thoroughly with all that was said
by my honourable friend the leader of the
House (Hon. Mr. King). The question that
we were dealing with, before the interjection
about caucuses, is one that has been before
this Chamber ever since Confederation. I
refer to the lack of work in the Senate. What
are the reasons for that? Well, we know what
the reasons are just now. We are living in a
time of war. At present 90 per cent of the
Government's work is directed towards the
war effort. A large part of the actual law
required to deal with the situation is enacted
by Orders in Couneil and never reaches us
at all. The amount of what might be called
peace-time legislation that reaches us to-day
is exceedingly small. This condition will continue until the war is over, and we may as
well face it.
There is another reason.
As a rule,
Ministers bandling public legislation are
desirous that it should be introduced in the
House of Commons. That is a natural inclination and is very difficult to overcome.
We have had some instances where such
legislation came to us first, and I think it can
be said, and said truthfully, that the Senate
gave full consideration to several important
measures and amended them to good purpose. I do not think there can be any doubt
about that at all. My honourable friend who
leads the other side at the present time will
have difficulty in overcoming the desire of
Ministers to introduce their legislation in the
other Chamber. Nevertheless, he may succeed in getting a certain proportion of that

154

SENATE

Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: What about human
rights?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Possess your soul in peace
and I shall come to that point.
The question of world-trade ought to be
studied. When the war is over-if it concludes as we anticipate it will-we shall find
world conditions so changed that a great
impetus will be given to international trade,
and we shall have still greater opportunities
of expanding our commerce with the countries
of Asia and Europe, and with our friends in
the Americas. Canada ranks fourth or fifth
among the great trading nations of the world,
and in relation to population might well be
accorded first place. Therefore we ought to
study that problem of post-war world-trade,
and the Senate is the very body to study it.
Another question of urgent importance is
unemployment relief. Some will say that
we shall not have any unemployment after
the war. I hope it may be so. But to be
prepared for any contingency, should we
not study the systems of relief in the United
States, in Great Britain, and in our different
provinces? Can you tell me how relief is
handled in Manitoba? I think I can tell
you all about it, and I can tell you something
about Saskatchewan.
But can I tell you
how it is handled in Nova Scotia, in Quebec,
in Ontario or in British Columbia?
The
problem of relief is one that should be
studied. Should the relief be in cash or
should it be in kind? Or should there be
relief at all? Should the money be used for
other purposes?
Another problem which we should study is
that of social reform. The honourable senator
from Parkdale (Hon. Mr. Murdock) wanted
me to bring up this subject sooner, but I
left it till the last because I think it is the
most important.
Social reform-and what
I am about to say may sound somewhat
radical, but it is not-social reform is just
a question of human riglits. We in the
Senate are regarded with suspicion when we
mention the subject of human rights, but
we are the last people in the world who
should be looked upon in that way, provided
we carry out our own ideas. I hope I am
right in thinking that we believe that every
human being in our country, or in any
other country, has a right not only to freedom
in the matter of worship and religion, but
also to a job by which he may maintain
himself and his family in decent circumstances.
Some Hon. SENATORS:
Hon. Mr. HAIG.

Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. HAIG: That is what we, as
Canadians, believe. Perhaps you will pardon
a personal reference. In 1914 I ran in the
Manitoba provincial election in a district
where labour received the poorest wages in
the province. I called on every home in the
constituency, and I noticed that when the
men came home to supper their children ran
out to meet them in just the same way that
mv kiddies did when I got home at night. I
realized then that among these people there
was the same human bond of love that exists
elsewhere.
We nust recognize that fact.
Social reform is something that we should
study. We should approach it without prejudice and with an open mind, in an effort
to get at what is best for our country. You
can put more taxes on the rich, and put
them almost out of existence; but, while that
may give money to the Government, it will
not accomplish social reform.
You must
understand the problem, and you must desire
to solve it. That is one thing that we in this
House can consider, and it is our duty to
do so. If the members of the House of
Commons attempt to deal with it, the cry of
political prejudice is sure to be raised. We
should not be subject to that difficulty. I
nay remember in a moment of weakness, or
of pride, that I was formerly a Conservative;
but fundamentally I should be guided, as I
am sure we all should be, by the fact that we
as members of the Senate are freer than
the members of the other House.
Hon. Mr. KING: Honourable senators, I
am afraid I have led you into committing
a breach of the rules. When I entered the
Chamber I understood that the doors had
not been opened, and accordingly I made
the statement which I did. I had no idea
that we were going to launch into a debate
such as we have had. That debate has been
very useful, and I do not think there is any
reason why it should not go to the publie.
I would suggest, however, that we now
proceed in an orderly manner.
If it is
thought desirable to continue this discussion,
it should be continued on the Orders of the
Day. I would ask, therefore, that we proceed
to the Order Paper.
Hon. C. W. ROBINSON: I do not want to
dissent from the views of the honourable
leader, but I am afraid that we may miss an
opportunity.
Hon. Mr. KING: The honourable gentleman will have an opportunity on -the Orders
of the Day.
Hon. Mr. ROBINSON:
objections-

If there are any

MAY 7, 1942
Hon. Mr. KING: No.
Hon. Mr. ROBINSON: In the first place,
I want to congratulate the leader of the
House on initiating what I think is a worthwhile debate. At the same time I should
like to congratulate the honourable gentleman
and the honourable leader on the other side
of the House upon being elevated to the
positions which they now occupy. I am sure
they will fill those positions to the satisfaction
of everybody. We shall discover, perhaps,
that it is not the intellectual giant who makes
the best leader, but the real, worth-while,
all-round man.
There is just one point brought up here
to-day that I want to discuss, and that is
post-war rehabilitation. There seems to be
an impression that the public may not have
a proper appreciation of the work of the
Senate. I want to say that only this week
a prominent citizen of Montreal, after writing
to me, caine up and had lunch with me in
order to tell me that post-war rehabilitation
afforded a splendid opportunity to the Senate
to appoint a committee and investigate the
matter. He said he knew the public would
place much more reliance in work done by a
committee of the Senate than in that done
by any committee elsewhere. I mention this
so that honourable members may know that
there are prominent people who look to the
Senate to take action. Although I have not
asked permission to do so, I think it would
do no harm to mention this gentleman's
name. It is Mr. Sherrard. I told him he was
wasting his eloquence on me, but if he would
come again I might be able to get a group of
senators to listen to him.
I rose at this time because I did not want
to miss the opportunity to tell of this little
incident, so that honourable members might
realize that there are people who have considerable respeect for the activities of the Senate.
Hon. CREELMAN MacARTHUR: Honourable senators, in the first place we started
out with a constructive suggestion by the new
leader of the Senate, who received a promise
of hearty co-operation from the leader on
the other side. That was splendid; but we
got away from that into a somewhat contentious argument.
I think the honourable
senator from Parkdale (Hon. Mr. Murdock)
was a little hard on the honourable senator
from Vancouver (Hon. Mr. MeRae), and
that the honourable senator from Saltcoats
(Hon. Mr. Calder) was a little hard on the
honourable member from Leeds (Hon. Mr.
Hardy).
The honourable senator from Winnipeg
(Hon. Mr. Haig) said that in a moment of
weakness it might be difficult for him to
forget that he had bpen a Conservative.

155

Hon. Mr. HAIG: Louderl
Hon. Mr. MacARTHUR: I was thinking
about the leader on the other side, and his
views of a few years ago. I do not want to
get into any controversy with the honourable
senator from Saltcoats about caucuses, but I
may say that our leader would never allow
us to have a caucus before we voted. It is
quite probable, therefore, that I often voted
wrongly. I cannot be accused of political
bias, because I have been called down not
only by the late leader on the other side,
but also by my own leader and other gentlemen on this side, particularly the honourable senator from Parkdale.
There are two or three minor matters that
I think we should mend. I have no criticism
of the honourable senator from Westmorland
(Hon. Mr. Copp), who is Chairman of the
Committee of Selection, except that he followed the line of least resistance, proposing the
same number and kinds of committees, as
before, with only a few changes in the personnel. I have been here for sixteen years,
during which I have been on the Finance
Committee, but as yet I have never known of
anything being referred to that committee
by the House. That committee may have
brought in a report naming a quorum, but
that is the only thing it has ever done.
Reference has been made also to the Committee on External Affairs. And I might ask
what the Tourist Committee is going to do
this year. Its appropriation, which was
$500,000 last year, bas now been eut down
to $100,000; and conditions, as you know, are
not favourable. Some of our committees
should be reorganized. We have new members
coming in from time to time, but all that is
done in the formation of committees is to
change the names around a little, and now
and again to take off a name or put one on.
I think there could be an improvement there.
Some two or three years ago I made a
remark in this House about going home, and
spoke of the expense of travelling to and
from Ottawa, and of the disruption of family
life and business by reason of adjournments.
I also offered certain suggestions.
The other day reference was made to the
trade agreements with Chile, the Argentine
Republic and Brazil. If you turn to page
79 of Hansard of March 10 you will find
that I wanted these treaties discussed in Committee of the Whole. If that had been done
the Minister of Trade and Commerce could
have come here and sat in, and we could
have had the details on Hansard; but the
treaty went to a standing committee and in
a few minutes it was accepted. It was said,
"You eau do nothing else." The committee

SENATE

'56

was simply a rubber stamp. No information was given as to what we were giving
Chile, for instance, or what we were gettting
from that country in return.
It was the
old order; the report came in, and there is
nothing at ail in Hansard in regard to the
treaty.
I think some of these things can be
remedied, and I hope they will be. I think
the two leaders are going to work together,
and I hope they will get results.
Hon. R. B. HORNER: Honourable senators, I wish to make a few remarks with
regard to a work of necessity which I think this
body might take up, though I should much
prefer that someone who is better able than
I te present the case should do se. The
honourable senator from Vancouver bas
spoken, and properly so, about the planning
that we might now do for the return of the
thousands of young people who will come back
into civil life after the war.
As the father of a family of both boys
and girls who are eager to go into the
army, I am very much alarmed at some of
the things I have heard, which I hope are
not entirely true-things that result from a
lack of a proper sense of morality in teaching.
I noticed in to-day's paper a resolution passed
unanimously in the Quebec Legislature, urging
the Covernment to be careful to see that
nothing it does shall interfere with the
permanency of the home as the greatest institution and the backbone of the nation. I
entirely agree with that.
I do net know what steps the Government
takes to see whether enough chaplains are
appointed to the Forces, and whether there
are sufficient gymnasia and other facilities
for the athletic activities and the entertainment of our boys in uniform. From what I
have noticed I am afraid that there is a great
laek in these respects.
No doubt many honourable members have
read an article in the May issue of Magazine
Digest, dealing with certain causes of the
downfall of France. It is entitled "Smut and
the Fall of France," and is condensed from the
Hibbert Journal, of London. With your permission I will quote one paragraph, but I
commend the -article as a whole to ail who
have not yet read it.
By the middle of the nineteenth century, the
symptoms which in present-day France are
revealing themselves as a devastating disease
were already apparent to those who looked
closely for them. Chiefly in the character of
the popular plays and novels and in the press
were the msost noticeable signs to be found.
I do not krnow what cen-orship there is
of the books in our public libraries and in
Hon.

Mr. MacARTHUR.

our Parlianentary Library. I want to mention here one book whose circulation is, I
think, a disgrace to any country. It is
entitled, "For Whom the Bell Toils". There
was a time, years ago, when it would have
been illegal to publish anything of the kind
in this country. I am sure that nothing but
demoralization could result frorn reading it.
Surely there is a lack of proper censorship
when a book like that can be distributed ail
over this country. I still beliesve in the good,
old-fashioned methods and principles of raising a family and maintaining a home.
I should think there is a very good opportunity for the Senate to do valuable work in
studying the needs of our armed forces for
athletic and entertainment facilities. And I
want here to urge upon the Government the
importance of doing everything possible to
sec that these needs are adequately supplied.
DIVORCE BILLS
FIRST

READINGS

Hon. Mr. ROBINSON, Chairman of the
Committee on Divorce, presented the following Bills, whici were severally read the first
time:
Bill R2, an Act for the relief of William
Milroy Davidson.
Bill S2, an Act for the relief of Audrey
Meredith Mann Harrison.
Bill T2, an Act for the relief of François
Henri Drack.
Bill U2, an Act for the relief of Gladys
Irene Dale Weston.
Bill V2, an Act for the relief of Ruth
Ufland Fishman.
Bill W2, an Act for the relief of ýNorma
Brown Stevenson.
Bill X2, an Act for the relief of Mary
Cummings Bullock.
Bill Y2, an Act for the relief of Elizabeth
Gertrude DeSerres Gould.
Bill Z2, an Act for the relief of John
Clifford Stanley Darbyson.
Bill A3, an Act for the relief of Celia
Reynolds Schellenberg.
SECOND READINGS

Hon. Mr. ROBINSON: Honourable members, owing to special circumstances, as it is
expected the Senate will adjourn this afternoon for a considerable period, I would move,
with consent, that these Bills be now read a
second time.
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: Honourable senators,
I gathered frorn the Divorce Committee's
reports, as they were being read by the Clerk,
that there was to be a refund of fees to the
applicants in some of these cases. As the

MAY 7, 19412
evidence bas flot yet been printed, I think we
should have an explanation af the reason why
these refunds are to be made.
Hon. Mr. ROBINSON: I thought the general procedure for handling these matters was
well known. A small proportion of the petitioners for divorce apply for remission of part
of the parliamentary fees, on the ground of
inability to pay thema in full. This is flot a
rich man's Parliament, aithougli some people
appear to think it is. We discuss every one of
these applications on its merits. It is provided
in the Rules that the -committee, if satisfled
that the petitioner is not flnancially in a position to pay ail the fees, may recommend that
part of them be remitted. The initial
fee,'
if I remember correctly, is $210, which perlisps more than pays for 'the cost. I do flot
knýow -,hat the actual cost of the printing is.
[n very few cases do we reduce the fee ta
less than $100. In some cases, however, the
committee has felt justified in reducing it ta
$75, and even Vo $5W. Most of the persons
who apply for divorce have noV mucli means.
Many of them have very littie money and fia
property or other assets. Quite of'ten the
applicant is a woman who has been deserted
by her husband and lias Vo depend upon lier
cown industry to support herself and any child
or children she may have. Honourable ruerabers can well understand -why the committee
thinks it advisable in such cases ta reduce the
fees.
The motion was agreed Va, on division, and
the Bills were severally read the second time.
THIRD READINGS

Hon. Mr. ROBINSON: Honourable senators,
with leave of the Senate I would move that
these Bills be read a third time naw.
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: Do I understand
that the evidence in these cases has flot yet
been printed?
Hon. Mr. ROBINSON: That is right.
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: Surely we should
not give third readings ta these, Bills until
the evidence lias been printed and made available for consideration by hon-ourable members.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: Does the honlourable
gentleman wish ta read the evidence?
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: No.
Hon. Mr. ROBINSON: I do Roit know what
ta say about Vhis. We cannot have the third
readings this afteTnoýon except by unanim:ous
consent, and, if the honourable gentleman
objects, I suppose we shail have Vo wait until
-when?

The Hon. the SPEAKER: Next sitting.
lion. Mr. KING: About two or Vhree weeks.
Hon. Mr. ROBINSON: That is a long wait.
If we put the Bills Vhrough to-day, the honoura-ble gentleman would have an opportunity
ta read some literature laVer on. I should like
the Bills to be passed to-day, but I do not
know whether I can persuade him ta consent.
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: Honourable senators, I was impressed by the debate we had
a short while aga about the importance of
the duties of the Senate. It seemed ta me
that, as we had this work Vo do, and as it
was incumbent upon us to pass competent
judgment upan the Bis, we should at least
have the opportunity, mucli as we might noV
wish ta take advantage of itHon. Mr. HAIG: Does the honourable
senator wish to hecome a member of the
Divorce Committee?
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: No.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I wouid give him my
place.
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: We should have
an oppartunity of reading the evidence adduced
before the cammittee.
Hon. Mr. ROBINSON: Wifl the honourable gentleman withdraw his objection?
I may say the Divorce Committee lias quite
a lot of work ta do; and perhaps the Senate
and the public should 'know that at least one
committee hs doing same work.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. ROBINSON:- I think that so
far this session we have received 102 petitians.
They will not ahl came bef are us, but we
aVilI have a good deal of work Va do. IV may
interest honourable members Vo know that
during the last adjournment of the Senate aur
committee sat for a week or ten days, and,
if there is Vo be a further adj ournment now,
some of us will have ta stay over andi work
ail next week. I should be pleased Vo make
this motion Vo-marrow, if the Senate could
help us out with aur work.
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: I withdraw my
objection.
The motion was agreed Vo, on division,
and the Buis were severally read the third
time, and passed.

INTERNAL ECONOMY AND
CONTINGENT ACCOUNTS
ABSENCE OF COMMITTEE REPORT

Hon. JAMES MURDOCK: The honourable senator from Saltcoats (Hon. Mr. Calder)
gave me permission te start something, and
I am going to do se. This morning the Committee on Internal Economy and Contingent
Accounts met and passed a motion. I was
expecting that the committee would this
afternoon present to the Senate a report for
our consideration, and I was going to deal
with that report because what has been donc
is, I submit, entirely inconsistent with one's
conception of what in days gone by were
regarded as the proprieties between boss and
worker. We are all wishing our new leader
the best of luck, and are ready to give him
every possible assistance. But what happened this morning? The committee appointed
as his assistant a gentleman on the Senate
staff drawing a salary of. S4,400 a year, and
with that appointment goes a remuneration of
8600 a ycar, which means that for the futureHon. Mr. SINCLAIR: May I ask if my
honourable friend is discussing a report submitted by the committee?
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK:
I am raising a
question which I think should b- discussed in
this House in the absence of any report froi
the committee.
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR:
before us?

The report is not

Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: The point is that
the acting leader of the Senate gets $4,000 a
year, but the gentleman who is assisting him
will, by the action taken by the committece,
be placed on a S5,000 basis. This is entirely
foreign to my lifelong conception of what the
boss is entitled te. But if the honourable
senator frem Quecn's (Hon. Mr. Sinclair) and
other honourable members think we should
not discuss the matter, J shallHon.

Mr. TANNER.

Hon. Mr. ASELTINE:
Would not the
proper time for discussion arise when the
committee makes its report?
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: The committee is
net making a report. That is why I rose.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: Why net?
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: The members of
the committee tell me that a report is net
necessary; that all the authorities want is a
resolution of the committee authorizing payment of $50 a month to this gentleman who is
to help our leader. That is all that is needed,
apparently. Therefore a report is not forthcoming. And that is why you have te pardon
my bringing the question up at the only time
it could be brought up. I think the action
of the committee is wrong in principle, and in
my view the committee ought to be instructed
te reconsider the matter and bring in a report
for our attention.
Hon. E. S. LITTLE: Honourable senators,
I do net think there is really anything before
the House at the' moment, but for the benefit
of my honourable friend from Parkdale I
may repeat what I said this morning in the
Committee on Internal Economy and Contingent Accounts. The appointment in question had been made with full authority, but
the Auditor General requested that approval
of the committee be given te the appointment. There is notbing whatever mentioned
with regard te salary in the motion which I
presented to the comnmittee this morning.
The motion is simply that the committee confirin the appointment in ordur, as J then
explained, te neet the request of the Auditor
General. We had the assurance of the Clerk
of the Senate that nothing further was required relative to the appointment, nor was
it necessary te submit a report to the House.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: But the honourable gentleman will admit that this morning
the committee arranged to give $600 a year
to a man who is already drawing $4,400 and
who, J think, is net overworked, while his
chief is getting only 84.000 a year.
Hon. J. H. KING: Honourable senators, I
think I am the one chiefly concerned in the
matter under discussion.
In selecting Mr.
Hinds to do this work I was taking advantage
of his experience and knowledge. It was net
my intention at this time to bring in someone from outside to act as secretary to the
leader. Mr. Hinds is familiar with the procedure of the Senate and of our committees,
and with his full knowledge and wide experience of these matters it seemed to me be would
be very helpful to me, especially with my
lack of experience.
The salary is $50 a

MAY 7, 1942
month, and there is a sum of $600 set aside
for the purpose. He will draw $50 a month
only during the parliamentary session. Mr.
Hinds has been secretary to other leaders of
the Senate. I understand he did a great deal
of work for Mr. Meighen while he led the
House, and I have no doubt Mr. Meighen
chose him because of his ability and experience. I do not think my friend from Parkdale
(Hon. Mr. Murdock) need give the matter
a great deal of consideration. If at a later
date we think it wise to appoint a secretary
we can do so. I take full responsibility for
making the recommendation to the committee.
I am informed the committee accepted it.
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: Honourable members,
there is one point I think we should take
notice of, in connection with this matter which
has been raised by the honourable senator
from Parkdale. If the Committee on Internal
Economy and Contingent Accounts can pass
motions of the kind referred to without
reporting to the Senate, we should know
whence it gets its authority. It is a standing
committee of this House, and in my view its
members have a right to deal only with matters
referred to the committee in the order of
reference.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: They are afraid
to report for fear the facts will come out.
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: A motion of that
committee is of no force or effect until the

report is adopted by this House.
I just rose to point out that if our standing
committees are to function in that way,
without reporting to the House, their duties
are very different from what I have always
understood them to be.
Hon. Mr. WHITE: Honourable senators,
as chairman of the committee referred to, I
may say that I inquired of the Clerk of
the Senate this morning whether it 'was
necessary for the committee to submit a
report on this matter, and I was informed
that it was not. Therefore no report has
been presented by me.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: And yet you will
recall that a few days ago we had to deal
with the situation of the late Senator Dandurand's secretary.
Hon. Mr. LITTLE: An entirely different
matter.

Hon. Mr. ROBINSON: Surely the action
of a committee is of no effect until it is
ratified by this House. Are we to understand
that a committee can take action, and that
there is no obligation to report to this House?

159

Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: That is what we
are told.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: There is some misunderstanding. The man was appointed by the
leader of the House. The Auditor General
raised some question as to whether he could
pay the money or not, and said to the
senator from London (Hon. Mr. Little),
"I want a resolution passed by the Committee
on Internal Economy and Contingent Accounts." The senator then presented a
motion, which was carried unanimously, and
I took it for granted that the matter ended
there. The committee was not usurping the
authority of the House at all; it was simply
complying with the request of the Auditor
General. I think the honourable leader himself probably had a right to make the
appointment, but apparently the Auditor
General thought this resolution should be
passed. The honourable senator from Parkdale (Hon. Mr. Murdock) was on the committee and did not even say the proverbial
"Boo". I can assure the House that the
members of the committee were not trying
at all to avoid coming to the House, but
were simply trying to make it clear to the
Auditor General that they, as a committee,
were accepting and confirming what the
leader had done.
Hon. B. F. SMITH: You are establishing a
most dangerous precedent.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Let me answer the honourable senator right now. The whole question
of the rights and powers of the Committee
on Internal Economy and Contingent
Accounts is now before that committee. It
has had before it a legal opinion by the late
W. F. O'Connor, K.C., and the opinion of
the present Parliamentary Counsel. At the
next meeting it is to decide upon the policy
to be adopted; then it will bring a report to
this House. That will be the proper time to
raise questions as to what the committee may
or may not do. Whether it has been right
or wrong, I do not know. We shall thrash
that out later. The Sact is that the committee sometimes has to deal with small
items affecting temporary help and that kind
of thing, and apparently in previous years it
has not been thought necessary to make a
detailed report of these matters to this
House. That is how it comes that the
Auditor General wanted to get the confirmation of the committee. I can assure the
honourable gentleman from Queen's (Hon.
Mr. Sinclair), and the honourable members
from Victoria-Carleton (Hon. Mr. Smith)
and Moncton (Hon. Mr. Robinson)-these
Maritimers seem to want to know an awful

SENATE
lot-that when the report comes in the whole
problem can be discussed and thrashed out.
I for one, and I think I speak for the whole
committee, say that we never intended to do
anything to affront the House or to adopt
back-door nethods.
Ion. Mr. MURDOCK: The honourable
senator is absolutely right: I made no objection this morning. But why was that? It
was because I assumed that the report would
come to the Senate, and because I did not
know then that the gentleman to whom we
were giving 850 a month was already getting
84,400 a year, although the honourable leader
gets only $4,000. That is my only excuse for
raising this question now. I say, never mind
what we are going to do later when we go
into the rules, but let us decide if this is
riglit.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE:
Honourable
senators, I may say with respect to the payment of $600 a year to the leader's secretary,
that it is in accordance with what has been
done for several years, and I know that my
predecessor's secretary was paid the same
amount. The honourable leader of the House
could bring in a secretary of his own, and
if be did, the $600 would have to be paid.
But he prefers, very wisely, I think, to have
an experienced official like Mr. Hinds, who
will not only act as his secretary, but will also
assist him in a great many other ways in
regard to legislation, the debates, and so on.
The point that I wish to make very clear is
that the commit tee is only doing what has
been donc before, over a long period of years.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Will the honourable gentleman say whether or not his
predecessor did this same thing? Did his
predecessor's lady secretary get a cheque for
$50 a month, endorse it and turn it over to
the man we are now talking about? Is that
right? I am told that it is.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: I cannot answer
that. I know that Mr. Meighen's secretary
received payment.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: And endorsed the
cheques over to the man we are now discussing, I am told. I should like to be put right
if I am wrong.
Hon. Mr. KING: I have no knowledge of
that.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: What puzzles me
most in connection with this very interesting
discussion is the reason why the Auditor
General should require a resolution from the
committee.
Hon. Mr. DUFF: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. HAIG.

Hon. Mr. HAIG: We do not know.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: If that is the requirement, it puzzles me to know why the resolution did not reach us. What is there in connection with this appointment that requires a
resolution? The requirement comes from the
Auditor General himself. Where does the
authority come from that enables our Committee on Internal Economy and Contingent
Accounts to pass a resolution without reference to this House? It all seems very strange
to me.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: That is what I want
to know.
Hon. Mr. KING: I suggest that we let the
matter stand and make further inquiries to
sec if it cannot be disposed of in a way that
satisfies the louse. I am not familiar with
the matter.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. KING: The committee can meet
again and reconsider it.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: The question
stands.
P.E.I. CAR FERRY AND TUNNEL
INQUIRY

Hon. Mr. MacARTHUR inquired of the
Government:
1. Is it the intention of the Government to
attempt the raising and rehabilitation of the
car ferry sunk last summer?
2. Is there another boat being procured for
additional service between Prince Edward Island
and the mainland?
3. Has the Government up-to-date data re
cost of tunnel between Prince Edward Island
and New Brunswick?
Hon. Mr. KING: The answers to the
inquiry of the honourable gentleman are
as follows:
1. Salvage of the vessel is not regarded as
practicable. This view is based on the report
of the underwriters' surveyor, who is also
representative of the Salvage Association of
London, which reads as follows:
The undersigned conferred with officials of
the Canadian National Railways, also Maritime
Towing & Salvage Ltd., Halifax, and Messrs.
Merritt, Chapman & Scott Corporation, New
York, on the possibilities of salvage of the
"Charlottetown".

The salvage conpanies, after

careful consideration of the vessel's location,
and with the plans of the vessel at their disposal, consider the salvaging of the "Charlottetown" not practicable. It is therefore reconmended that no expense be incurred by attempting examination or salvage of the vessel.
In consequence of the above report, confirmed by a separate opinion by Foundation
Maritime Limited, the Department of Trans-

MAY 7, 1942
port duly approved the abandonment of the
ship to the underwriters, and made the eusto-mary dlaima for payment of the insurance.
Inasmucb as the dlaim bas been paid, any
further question of salvage would now be for
the consideration of the underwriters.
2. The possibility of securing a standby
vessel for additional service between Prince
Edward Island and the mainland continues to
engage the attention of thé Canadian National
Railway authorities and their marine advisers,
and if some arrangement of this nature is
found to be possible, it will he done.
3. In 1929 Canadian National Railway
engrneers prepared estimates of the probable
cost of providing direct rail communication
with Prince Edward Island. Three possibilitics were considered, (a) a tunnel, (b) a
causeway, or (c) a bridge, and the estirnated
expenditures as of that date were approximately as follows:
(a) Tunnel-i. 0f steel and concrete cylinders laid on hottom, 378,000,000. 2. Driven
through underground with shield and air pressure, $116,000,000. 3. Driven through ground
if no air pressure needed, $38,000,000.
(b) Causeway, $46,000,000.
(c)ý Bridge, $77,000,000.

articles a ship arrived f rom. the West Indies
with a cargo of bananas. Sorne of thern, not
being in a condition for shipment to Central
and Western Canada, were dumped into the

the waters of the Northwest Arm, and at the

so thick that the ferry operator had to use

his boat-hook for thirty feet from the shore
to push them out of the way in order to get
bis boat loto his landing. I submait, honourable senators, that in times like these, when in
some parts of the world many people are
starving, such valuable food as bananas, which
have a bigh vitamin content, shouid flot bo
destroyed. In the matter of food supplies we
are fortunate in this country, it is true, but,
in some parts of the world millions of people
wouild be glad of fruit such as was thrown
overboard at Halifax.
The newspaper stated that a highi officiai
of the importing company, which I gather is
a monopoiy, was approacbed with rcgard to
this food and asked if he could flot find some
way to have it distributed to institutions and
to the poor. His answer was, "No." Then it
was urged on him that the public ivas intorested
in this. H1e said, "It ia none of the public's

I submit, hononrable senators,
that it is the public's business and I regard
it as a matter ut sufficient importance to be
brought to the attention of Parliament. I
would ask the honourable the acting leader
of the Government (Hon. Mr. King) te report

for Canada, are so formulated as to prevent the
only oil producing company in the Maritimes
from marketing its produet to the public, thus
reducing tbe supply of gasoline in that part
of Canada?

Mr. RýING.

me a note saying tliat the amount asked for in
the Bill as originally drafted, one-sixtb af tbe
total supply for the year, bas been cut ta
one-twelfth. It will be remembered that same
weeks ago we passed a bill for one-sixth of tbe
year's total. It is common practice for us ta
receive every session one or more bills for a
fraction of the total appropriation, and usually
they do not result in any debate bore. Honourable senators wi]l notice that thore are two
money clauses in this Bill. The first asks for
one-twelfth of aIl items in tlie main Estimates,
$19,401,568.20. Tbat is required ta, carry on the
business of the Coverninont during the next
few weeks. The next clause asks for S550,655.91, whicb is an additional one-twelfth of
certain selectcd items, made necessary by tbe
seasonal nature of the work, provided for. A
schedule is attacbed showing that this money
is needed for the Departments of Fisheries,
Agriculture, Mines and Resources, and Public
Works, and the House of Commons.
Hon. C. C. BALLANTYNE: Honourable
senators, I bave not a copy of this Bill
before nie. After listening ta the explanation
given by the honourablo leader of the House
(Hon. Mr. King), the only thing 1 bave ta,
say is that I hiope the Governmnent is exerting
keen vigilance xwith regard ta ordinary expenditures. There soems ta be an impression, right
or wrong, that a very large number of persans
are employed by the Government in this city
and elsowbore, and I sincerely trust tbat they
ail are usefully employed. I know that the
time and tboughts of ail the ministers are
concentrated more on the war effort than on
ordinary activities of governmont, and I risc
inerely ta express the hope that the Coveroment will exert evcry effort-especially ns aur
war expenditures are so heavy-ta kcep ordinary expendittires down ta the very lowest

WELLINGTON STREET, OTTAWATRAFFIC CONTROL
INQUIRY

Hon. Mr. TANNER
inquired of the
Government:
1. Is the title to Wellington Street, in the City
of Ottawa, or any part of it, vested in the Crown
in the right of the Dominion Government?
2. Has the Dominion Government any control
or right of supervision of traffic lights and of
traffic in general on said street?
3. If the title to said street is in the Crown
in the right of the Dominion Government, when
was control of traffic lights and traffic in general
on said street transferred to the City of Ottawa;
and by what means was the transfer made?
Hon. Mr. KING: I have an answer to
the honourable senator's inquiry. The answer
to questions No. 1 and No. 2 is No. The
third' question is answered by the answer

to questions No. 1 and No. 2.

That he will ask for a copy of all correspondence exchanged between the Government
and all competent authorities, Royal Canadian
Mounted Police, etc., concerning the supposed

Hon. Mr. SAUVE: Honourable senators,
in submitting this motion it is not my desire
to reflect upon anyone.
I am desirous of
knowing the facts as established after the
investigation carried out by the federal
police in the case of Hamelin, his victims
and his accomplices; and I should also like
to know if the postponement board sitting
at Montreal has taken into consideration the
errors of the said victims and whether these
persons have appeared before the tribunal.
If Hamelin had accomplices, have they been
arrested and sentenced? Hamelin seems to
have shown that he was aware of the board's
decisions. I would request the authorities
to produce this return at their earliest convenience, and after I receive it I shall comment upon the official documents.
May I add here that the newspapers, for
fear of censorship, did not dare to report my
notice of motion. Should censorship go so far
as to prevent reporting inquiries such as this?
On the contrary, I believe the widest publicity
should be allowed in cases like Hamelin's.
Is it not a sane policy to put the public on
guard against rogues of this kind? Such cases
were subjected to wide publicity and severe
criticism during the war of 1914-18.
Hon. Mr. KING:
Honourable senators,
I have noticed my honourable friend's remarks
and would ask that the notice of motion
stand till I have had an opportunity of making
an inquiry.

THIRD READING

Hon. J. H. KING moved the third reading
of Bill 81, an Act for granting to His Majesty
certain sums of money for the public service
of the financial year ending the 31st March,
1943.

He said:

Honourable senators, the Bill as

for one-sixth of the main Estimates, it being
the Minister's intention, apparently, to carry

through with this vote during the months of
June and July; but it was suggested that the

clause of the Bill to one-twelfth of the year's

total supply for the

SENATE

The third clause, which has been similarly
reduced, covers special conditions in regard to
farm payments and the conservation of salmon
in the Fraser River, as well as other items
that I mentioned last night. One-twelfth of
the total of the year's appropriation for these
items is being granted by clause 2 of the
Bill, but by clause 3 another twelfth is provided for, which would mean a sixth of the
total for the items therein mentioned. The
reason is that the items are seasonal and the
money will probably be required within the
next month.
I move third reading of the Bill.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was
read the third time, and passed.

PRIVATE BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. Mr. BEAUREGARD moved the
second reading of Bill B3, an Act respecting
certain transmission and distribution lines of
Saguenay Transmission Company, Limited,
Saguenay Electrie Company and Aluminum
Power Company, Ltd.
Hon. Mr. KING.

He said: Honourable senators, this Bill is
necessary in order to meet the requirement
of clause 4 of the Navigable Waters' Protection Act. The Aluminum Power Company and
its two subsidiaries whose names appear on
this Bill have constructed in the Lake St.
John district of Quebec a number of transmission and distributing lines across certain
rivers. The purpose of the Bill is to secure
from the Governor in Council ex post facto
approval of the lines so constructed.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: I understand
these transmission lines have already been
constructed. Has it been proven that they
interfere in any way with navigation?
Hon. Mr. BEAUREGARD: No. In fact
the lines were built at a time when there
was doubt whether the rivers in question were
navigable or not. The departmental report
is that the transmission lines do not interfere
with navigation. When they were built it was
not quite clear what constituted a navigable
river. I intend to move, after the Bill has
been given second reading, that it be referred
to the Standing Committee on Railways,
Telegraphs and Harbours. Before that committee I shall produce evidence that as a
matter of fact there is no navigation on these
rivers.
Hon. Mr. KING: I have no objection to
the Bill going to the committec, but I would
suggest that the chairman of the committee
ask the representatives of the Public Works
Department to be present.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Honourable senators, I
should like to ask a question. Do I understand
that a transmission linc cannot be built across
a navigable river without the consent of the
Department of Public Works?
Hon. Mr. BEAUREGARD:

That is right.

Hon. Mr. HAIG: And you cannot get that
consent after the lino is built?
Hon. Mr. BEAUREGARD: No. After the
line is built the Minister cannot grant ex post
facto permission on his own responsibility.
I may say that similar bills were passed last
year respecting bridges over the same rivers.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was
read the second time.
PETROLEUM

AND NAPHTHA INSPECTION BILL

SECOND READING

Hon. J. H. KING moved the second reading of Bill 2, an Act to repeal the Petroleum
and Naphtha Inspection Act.
He said: IHonourable senators, the purpose
of this Bill is to repeal an Act pased in 1877.

MAY 27, 1942

At that time natural oil products consisted
largely of kerosene, or, as it was called, coal
oil, and the enactment was passed by the
Dominion Government to control the dilution
of this coal oil by what we now know as
gasoline. Later, with the coming of the
internal combustion engine, a market was
found for gasoline, and to-day it is a product
much sought by oil companies.
The Dominion Government has maintained
a service at the refineries to check the coal
oil and the amount of gasoline in it, but that
has been found unnecessary by reason of the
fact that to-day various provincial governments, municipalities and public bodies control not only the production, but also the
transportation and sale of these products.
The Department of National Revenue has a
certain control, the railway companies impose
certain regulations, and the provincial governments in their field exercise a control. The
purpose of repealing the Act is to eliminate
an expenditure of $25,000, which has been
paid to certain officials sent to the various
refineries to make tests. Such tests are now
being made by the companies. This matter
was discussed at some length in the other
Chamber, and the repeal of the Act was consented to there.
I move the second reading of the Bill.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was
read the second time.
THIRD READING

When shall
The Hon. the SPEAKER:
this Bill be read a third time?
Hon. Mr. KING: Now, if there is no
objection.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was
read the third time, and passed.
NATIONAL RAILWAYS AUDITORS BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. J. H. KING moved the second reading of Bill 9, an Act respecting the appointment of Auditors for National Railways.
He said: Honourable senators, this Bill is
a hardy annual. It is necessitated by the fact
that from year to year Parliament appoints
the auditors to the Canadian National Railways. No change is proposed in the firm of
auditors, and, as the Bill has already passed
the Commons, I have no remark to make
except that it is in order for the Senate to
confirm the appointment of the auditors who
will act for the Canadian National Railways
for the year 1942-43.

Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: Could the honourable leader give us any information as
to what the charges have been in past years?
Hon. Mr. KING: Yes. The fee to be paid
to Touche & Company amounts to $51,800.
This involves an increase of $1,800, which is
caused by the inclusion of the Trans-Canada
Air Line Accounts and the Canadian National
Security Trust. In addition to the fee
mentioned the auditor is allowed such expenses, incurred when he is away from headquarters, as may be approved by the directors. These expenses average about $4,500
a year.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill
was read the second time.
THIRD READINGS

The Hon. the SPEAKER: When shall this
Bill be read a third time?
Hon. Mr. KING: Now, if there is no
objection.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill
was read the third time, and passed.
OTTAWA AGREEMENT BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. J. H. KING moved the second reading of Bill 11, an Act to authorize an Agreement between His Majesty the King and the
Corporation of the City of Ottawa.
He said: Honourable senators, this Bill
is similar to others which have come before
us since 1930. The period from 1920 to 1930
was covered by two agreements, each running
for five years.
There has been considerable discussion iL
regard to the demands of the City of Ottawa
and, as I was the Minister of Public Works
who in 1925 increased the amount from
$75,000 a year to $100,000 a year for a period
of five years-an amount which has continued
to be paid since-I think I may properly
offer a few comments on the situation. There
is an idea abroad that because the Dominion
Government owns large properties in Ottawa
the City is losing large sums that otherwise
would come to it in taxes. No government
has accepted that proposition or indicated
that it would for a moment consider paying
taxes on property owned by the Crown. To
do so would open a very wide field. Every
town or municipality in the Dominion of
Canada where the Government owned property would expect to be treated in the same
way as the City of Ottawa.
I think it was only in 1899 that the
Government recognized the right of the City

168

SENATE

of Ottawa to reccive a grant in some form;
not in lieu of taxation, but in recognition of
the fact that the Government had a certain
responsibility.
At that time Sir Wilfrid
Laurier, who, as we know, was very much
interested in the improvement and beautification of the Capital City, introduced legislation in regard to payments to the city, the
line of which has been followed ever since.
At that time he initiated the Ottawa Improvement Commission. By chapter 10 of
the Statutes of 1899 an annual grant of
$60,000 was authorized by Parliament, and
this was continued until 1920. I should like
to read from that Act a section which is
the basis of the action taken by various
governments in reference te the grant to the
city.
The annual grant payable under this Act
shall be in full payment, satisfaction and discharge of all claims and deniands by or on the
part of the Corporation on the Government of
the Dominion of Canada (hereinafter referred
to as "the Government,") in respect of water
supplied (including charges for street sprinkling) by the Corporation for use in and on all
buildings, lands and premises in the said City
of Ottawa.
In 1920 representations were made by the
City that the payment was not sufficient
for the services rendered, and an agreement
was entered into under which $75,000 was to
be paid annually in discharge of all claims
of the city against the Government for water
supplied for street sprinkling and for use in
parks and driveways under the control of the
Federal District Commission. This agreement
was for a period of five years. The main
clause of the agreement provided for an
annual grant of $150.000 to the Federal
District Commission for a period of ten years
from July, 1919.
In 1925 the claim was made by the City
that $75,000 was not sufficient for the supply
of water furnished to buildings used by the
Government, and the amount was increased to
$100,000. In that year the agreement was
renewed for five years, and since then the
annual payment of $100,000 has been continued. The increase was made te take care
of the cost of supplying water to Government
buildings, and the present grant is largely to
cover that cost. In 1914 the consumption of
water in Government buildings was 371,498,840
gallons, for whiclh the charge was $53,937.37.
There was also a charge of 10 per cent of the
purchase price of meters, amounting to
$1,459.34, making a total charge of $55,396.71
for water service. The agreement provides
that the City shall supply up to 200 million
gallons of water for these buildings at the
Hon. Mr. RING

rate of 13 cents per thousand gallons, and for
any additional quantity the charge is to be
increased by 25 per cent.
The City claims that the cost of providing
water service has been greatly increased, and
negotiations are now in progress between the
Department of Public Works and the City
with a view to ascertaining what the increase
in cost is, and whether it is necessary to
make an additional grant.
This year the Government's grant to the
Ottawa Improvement Commission was increased to $333,500.
On the whole, I think the arrangement made
for this year is probably acceptable to the
Corporation of Ottawa and the Department
of Public Works. It bas been concurred in
by honourable members in another place, and,
as I have stated, inquiry is being made with
regard te the City's claim that the cost of
providing water service has gone up. It is
felt that there should not be any increase in
the grant at this time.
Hon. L. COTE: Honourable senators, this
is a perennial measure which, as the honourable leader said a few moments ago, has been
coming to us every session since 1930. I have
already spoken on it at two or three past
sessions. There seems to be a feeling that at
this time, in view of the war, the allowance
to the City of Ottawa should not be increased,
although I understand negotiations are going
on just now with regard to the supplying of
water on a meter basis.
I think I am stating a fact when I say
that the citizens of Ottawa as a whole are
not at all satisfied that the present agreement with the Government affords to the City
a square deal. It is admitted that the Crown
bas a right te continue to claim immunity
from taxation. As I said once before in this
House, that is a right which came to the
Crown from the Middle Ages, when the Ring
owned property and you could net tax the
King or exact services from him on account

appreciate that, it being a money Bill, only
those in another place have the right to add
to or take from it. Everv session for the last
ten years a similar Bill has aroused criticism
from the representatives of Ottawa.
Right
now my honourable friend te my left (Hon.
Mr. Robinson) counters the complaint that
the amount involved is inadequate for the
civie services rendered to the federal authority
by stating that maybe Moncton and other
towns are entitled to some such consideration.
As I understand our leader, he told us that
the $100.000 is largely in payment for water
used in Government buildings.
If that is
the case, perbaps more water is being used
now than in former years, for the other day
I was advised that I could use my lawn hose
only on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays,
and taxpayers on the cast side of Bank street
are allowed te water their gardons on three
week-days and Sundays. This would indicate
a water shortage.
Of course we shall all
be glad to comîply with the rogulations. But
what does this water cost?
In respect of
my little home I pay $34 for water alone,
year in and ycar out.
That means three
homes similar to mine would pay more than
$100 a yoar and thirty homes up wards of
$1.000. and so on.
During flic pist vear
or eighteen months a number of proporties
have been taken over by the Coverinment
for war purposes, and no longer will they
be subject to city taxes. As a rcsuilt those of
us who are taxpayers willi have to dig into
our pockets and make good the deficit--and
we shall net complain very stronuously.
It is only a question of ascertaining what
is consistent and logical and what the Government should pay Ottawa for the civic services
which it receives.
During the past twelve
years conditions have changed; undoubtedly
1n war-time they have changcd materially;
and it may be that in consoquence the federal
authorities should increase their payment to
the City. Of course, we could net amend the
Bill in tis direction, even thoughi we found
that an increase would bc equitable; but
surely we can make a thorougli inquiry into
the matter.
There is no hurry about the
passage of this Bill.
A few days ago we
were looking for work, and I know many of
us honestly desire it now. All right, let us
refer this Bill to our Standing Committee
on Banking and Commerce.
Then we can
have the officials of the City and of the
Department of Public Works come before us
with all the facts in relation to the question,
so that we and those in another place will
know whether in future S100,000 is too much
or too little. For these reasons I shall second

second reading.
Hon. Mr. KING: Personally I sec no great
objection to the proposal. But this is a
money Bill. and though a similar suggestion
was made in the House of Commons. it was
not accepted. The Minister stated that his
department was engaged with the officials
of the city of Ottawa in an attempt to arrive
at what is fair compensation for the services
rendered by the City to the federal authorities.
Therefore I am inclined to think we should
leave the matter with them, se that next
session we shall have the benefit of their
report for our guidance.

Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: For ten years past
we have followed pretty much the same course
-always going to inquire into the merits, but
never doing anything. Thon along comes the
annual Bill for $100,000 paymîent to the City.
This may be enough, but we ought te know
whether it is or not. They are too busy in

All right, lt
this Bill be referred to our
Banking and Commerce Conmmittee, where we
can getr all the facts from the city fatliers,
the Public Works officials and everybody else

Hon. JOHN T. HAIG: I can sec some
reason in my honourable friend's argument.
In Winnipeg we have a similar issue with
our provincial Government. But the situation
bas become accentiated during the past two
years on account of war conditions. It is
manifestly unfair to ask the taxpayers of
Ottawa to pay extra taxes for the benefit of
the other taxpayers of Canada; for that is
what it amxounts to. True, this is a Government Bill, but, knowing humwan nature as I
think I do, I can assure the honourable leader
opposite that if this Bill were referred to our
Banking and Commerce Committee, and the
city officials of Ottawa were able to demonstrate to us beyond shadow of doubt that
insteal of paying $100,000 the Government
should pay $150,000, the officials of the Department of Public Works would be eager to
move a little faster in their negotiations with
the City.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK:

Hear, hear.

MAY 27, 1942
Hon. Mr. HAIG: That is usually the
effect on Government officials. I do not blame
them for their attitude, which probably would
be mine were I a Government official. This
is the Capital of the Dominion, and we ought
not to forget our obligation to the City. If
the Government desires to move any of its
departments, I can promise accommodation
in the city of Winnipeg free of taxes. For
instance, we should be glad to accommodate
the Department of National Revenue and the
Department of the Interior. In the United
States the Government has, since the war
started, been moving some of its nonwar departments out of Washington.
Hon. Mr. MORAUD:

And some of its

Hon. Mr. HAIG: I was not aware of that.
But I want to warn Ottawa: if any of our
Government departments are moved out of

Hon. A. D. McRAE: Honourable senators,
I agree entirely with the honourable member
from Moncton. I think the suggestion to
refer this Bill to our Standing Committee on
Banking and Commerce would open up what
is a burning question in many of our cities,
and you would have the representatives of
city corporations from Vancouver to Halifax
coming here to present their case and appeal
to us for support. This, I fear, would distract
the attention of our people at a time when
they should be devoting their every effort
towards winning the war. I think we should
be ill-advised to attempt to deal with the
matter, particularly in view of the fact that
negotiations are proceeding between the

Department of Publie Works and the Corporation. Every municipality would like to tax
Government property, and if once we open
up this question we shall have them on our
doorstep. I for 'One would certainly not support any proposal to refer the Bill to
committee.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Question!
Hon. J. A. CALDER: Since this discussion started, one thing has been turning itself
over in my mind: why we continue this tax
exemption of Government buildings. Why
should not the State pay civic taxes on its
buildings? The people of Canada, through
their Government, may decide to put up a
building in the City of Toronto to carry on
certain Government work for the people.
Why should not all the people of Canada
pay a tax on that building just as the citizens
of Toronto pay a tax on every building which
they erect? Take all the Government buildings across Canada: why should they continue under the protection of a law, at least
ten centuries old, exempting the Crown from
payment of taxes? After all, the Crown now
is the people; and if certain properties and
buildings are required for the purpose of
carrying on business in the interest of the
people as a whole, then why should not those
properties and buildings be subject to taxation? Tax exemption of Government property
is merely a perpetuation of the medieval right
of the King to be exempt from taxation.
That right does not exist now. The King
does not own this building. The people of
Canada own it and all the other buildings we
occupy and use. Why should the State not
pay taxes to the municipalities in which its
buildings are located?
Hon. F. B. BLACK: Honourable senators,
I agree, I
this is a very large question.
think, almost entirely with the remarks of
the honourable senator from Vancouver (Hon.
Mr. McRae). It is quite true that the system
of exempting Government property from taxation is inherited. It has come down to us
from the days when the King owned all
the property under his jurisdiction. But, as
the honourable senator from Moncton (Hon.
Mr. Robinson) and the honourable senator
from Vancouver (Hon. Mr. McRae) have said,
if we undertake to investigate the Ottawa
situation we shall be asked to investigate the
situation in Moncton, Saint John, Vancouver,
Toronto, and every other town where there
is Government property.
After all, we must remember that Government property is not the only property that
is exempt from taxation. Churches, hospitals,
buildings used for charitable purposes, and

172

SENATE

properties of that kind are exempt throughout
Canada.
They, like Government buildings,
are ownud by the public, and if we are to
remove the tax exemption from Government
properties, why should we not also remove
it fromn other properties which are exempt?
I thmnk the question is a very dangerous
one, and that we had better leave it alone.

Hon. Mr. HORNER: The second reading
ivas taken some time ago.

Hon. Mr. COTE: I moved that the Bill
be referrud to a committee-

Hon. Mr. HORNER: I wish to make a few
remarks merely for the information of lionourable members fromn the cities. In the rural
municipalities of Western Canada a great
deal of land is held by the Crown.

Hon. Mr. COPP: 1 submit that my honourable friend is entirely out of order.
We
have flot yet hiad the second reading. If we
had hiad the second reading, my honourable
friend*s motion would be in order.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: The question
is on the second ruading of the Bill.
Hon. Mr. KING: Honourable senators, I
spoke before, and I rather thought we were
through with the discussion, but I should
like to say that the question raised by the
honourable senator from Moncton (Hon. Mr.
Robinson) and discussed by the honourable
miember from Vancouver (Hon. Mr. McRae)
and others is somnewhat broader thian what is
proposed by the honourable senator from
Ottawa East (Hon. Mr. Coté).
Times have changed vcry much since the
day whien the Crown was first exempted
fromn taxation. To-day the Crown owns property and buildings for the use of
the people.«
I think the governments of Canada have buen
very caruful in regard to this question. They
have recognized the principle that certain
services should be paid for; but I do not
think that any goveroment herutofore hias
accepted. or that any goveroment to, come will
accept, the principle of making an allowance
in lieu of taxes on property it owns.
I hope my honourable friend will not press
his motion. These are difficult times. This
stibject lias been thoroughly reviewed in the
House of Commons. and the miembers there
were satisfied to allow the matter to stand
over until the officers dea]ing with it have

Hon. Mr. COPP: I suggest that the hionourable gentleman is speaking, not to, the
second reading of the Bill, but to the motion
to refer it to a committue. That is his
argument.
Hon. Mr. HORNER: I merely wish to, point
out that not only have the cities lost money
as a result of this exemption, but rural
municipalities in Western Canada also have
lost huge sums of money by rea.on of Government-owned lands being frce from taxation,
although the lands of individual farmers across
the road are taxed every year.

SENATE

Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: As a matter of
information I should like to know just what
form these negotiations between the Government and the City of Ottawa are assuming.
If they are merely a repetition of what has
been going on for ten years, I can see no
particular reason why we should not make an
exception this year and have some light
thrown on the subject in the Banking and
Commerce Committee. There is need, and great
need, it seems to me, for more light to be
thrown upon the relations between the Government and the City of Ottawa, for the
benefit not only of members of both Houses
and of the people of Ottawa, but of all the
people of this country. Possibly the position
of Ottawa as the Federal Capital of Canada
would be much more impressive and effective,
from a national point of view, if instead of
having dual authority in this aiea we had
something like the form of government prevailing at Washington.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: Formation of a
District of Ottawa would obviate all these
petty discussions which arise every year in
regard to payment by the Government for
services rendered by the municipality of
Ottawa. It seems to me there is a great deal
to be said in favour of taking steps, even
at this stage. towards the formation of a
District of Ottawa. That would suggest
national growth, for one thing. It would
suggest there is a prospect that after the war
this country will be much more definitely
national in its proportions than it has been
in the past. And I think it would be a
complete answer to the rather isolationist
suggestions of my honourable colleagues from
Moncton (Hon. Mr. Robinson) and Saskatchewan North (Hon. Mr. Horner), if we had
here a community identified with the dignity
of a capital city for the Dominion.
At any rate, no one wants to feel that
$100,000 is merely se much money thrown
into a pot every year without ary consideratien for the balancing of the accounts. I happen to live in a suburb adjacent to Ottawa,
which is helping to pay some of the water
charges that seem to be a point at issue
just now. It has been urged that the village
of Rockcliffe should protest vigorously that
the charges made to it for water supplied
by the City of Ottawa are at present beyond
all reason. If that position is correct, I might
be justified in assuming that the Government
should bc paying more than it is for its water
service. However that may be, I feel there
is a real case for having this whole subject
referred to the Committee on Banking and
Commerce.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK.

Hon. A. B. COPP: Honourable senators,
I dislike being one te place any obstacle in
the way of my honourable friend from Parkdale (Hon. Mr. Murdock), who wants to do
a lot of work in regard te this and other
matters, but I suggest we should think very
seriously before we refer a Bill such as this
to a committee with the object of carrying
on an investigation into matters that may
come under review later.
The purpose in referring a bill to a standing
committee is that the bill may be revised
there, if necessary. But, as I understand it,
no honourable senator recommends that this
Bill ought to be revised. I do net think
we should use this Bill as an excuse for
carrying on an investigation. If honourable
members feel it would be a useful undertaking for the Senate te have an inquiry into
the various matters that have been mentioned
here, it would be quite in order te appoint
a committee to study the whole question, and
we could then employ our brains upon it.
It would also give us an opportunity to take
advantage of the desire on the part of a
number of honourable members for extra work,
a desire with which I do net entirely agree.
But, I repeat, it would be a mistake to refer
this Bill te a committee for the purpose of
carrying on an inquiry.

Hon. J. H. KING moved the second reading
of Bill 16. an act te authorize the Governor
in Council te enter into agreemOnts with the
governments of the provinces of Canada
respecting the vacation by the provinces of
the personal income and corporation tax fields
for the duration of the war.
He said: Honourable senators, there are two
companion Bills here, Nos. 16 and 17.
In
Bill 16 it is proposed to give the Governor
in Council the right to enter into an agreement with the various provinces whereby
they will vacate the fields of income and cor-

MAY 27, 1942
poration taxes and permit those fields to be
occupied by the Federal Government alone.
At this time when the Dominion Government's
need of money for war purposes is so great,
such an agreement seems advisable, and,
indeed, absolutely necessary. The Bill provides that the Dominion will compensate the
provinces for their loss of revenue from these
sources. It is also agreed that the provinces
will give up the taxation on gasoline, and
in lieu of their expected receipts from that
source the Dominion will compensate them
on the 1940 basis.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Will the honourable
leader permit a question? Is he sure that
last statement is correct?
I thought the
intention was to compensate the provinces
for loss of revenue arising from restrictions
on the sale of gasoline.

The provinces will

continue to impose the tax.
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: That is right. Section 5 shows that.
Hon. Mr. MORAUD: The provinces will
still collect the tax.
Hon. Mr. KING: I know the intention of
the Minister is that the provinces should
not suifer loss of revenue because of the
restrictions on the sale of gasoline. Under
this arrangement they stand to gain, because
it is based on the revenues of 1940. The provinces will also continue to levy succession
duties.
I may say the agreements with five of
the provinces state the amount to be paid
to them for their ceasing to levy personal
income and corporation taxes is calculated
on the basis of their 1940 receipts from these
sources. These provinces are British Columbia,
Alberta, Manitoba, Ontario and Quebec. The
amount to be paid to each of the other four
provinces-Saskatchewan and the Maritimesis calculated as equivalent to the net debt
service paid by the province during its fiscal
year ending nearest to December 31, 1940.
Hon. Mr. MORAUD: Has Quebec signed
the agreement?
Hon. Mr. KING: Yes, Quebec has signed.
I have a note here that the necessary Bill has
been passed by the Quebec Legislature, and
the agreement has been signed, and has been
received by the Minister to-day. The agreement, which, it would seem, has now been
entered into with all the provinces, is to continue from year to year, until one year after
the war. Every province has the right to
complain at any time if not satisfied, and
upon giving thirty days' notice it may withdraw from the agreement.

175

Hon. C. P. BEAUBIEN: After the war?
Hon. Mr. KING: No; at any time.
I have given a brief outline of the Bill.
The matter is very important, and it seems to
me that it would, be well to have it referred
to the Banking and Commerce Committee
for consideration to-morrow morning. We
could have officers from the Department of
Finance present to tell us how they arrived
at the various amounts to be paid as compensation and to give us any other detailed
information required.
In moving second
reading now, I do so on the understanding
that the Bill will be referred to committee.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: The honourable leader has pointed out that the provinces
are to be compensated on the basis of the
taxes collected on gasoline during 1940. Well,
there will be a great difference between the
tax returns on gasoline in 1942 and in 1940.
Unless the provinces are willing to make some
adjustments with the Federal Government,
they will gain very handsomely.
Hon. Mr. KING: Of course, at the time
of the negotiations for these agreements there
was no indication that a gasoline shortage
would occur. I think the agreements were
not discussed on that basis.
Hon. C. P. BEAUBIEN: Will the Minister
explain a little more fully what is the basis
of the agreement with Saskatchewan?
Hon. Mr. KING: The province of Saskatchewan and the Maritime Provinces have
taken as the basis their debt service paid
in carrying on the public business for 1940,
and the Federal Government has agreed to
pay them the amount required for that purpose rather than a subsidy such as the
equivalent of the total revenue from income
tax.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: Rather than make
up the loss?
Hon. Mr. KING: Yes. They had the option
of taking one form or the other.
Hon. Mr. COTE: I have been expecting a
speech from the honourable senator from
Westmorland (Hon. Mr. Copp) against referring a money bill to a standing committee for
study.
Hon. Mr. COPP: This is not entirely a
money Bill. It is essentially an agreement to
do certain things.
Hon. Mr. COTE: An agreement to pay
certain money-just the same as the Ottawa
Bill.
Hon. Mr. COPP: It is an enabling agreement; quite a different thing.

Hon. Mr. KING moved the second reading

that in lieu of the Maritime subsidies which
were granted in pursuance of the recommendations of the Duncan Commission, additional
subsidies shall be paid; namely, to Nova
Scotia $1,300,000, to New Brunswick $900,000,
to Prince Edward Island $275.000.

TORONTO HARBOUR COMMISSIONERS
BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. Mr. KING moved the second reading
of Bill 68, an Act respecting the Toronto Harbour Commissioners.
He said: This is a short Bill and provides
that the Toronto Harbour Commissioners may
borrow money to the extent of $5,000,000 for
the purpose of refunding a portion of a
refunding Joan.
The explanatory note reads:
The Toronto Harbour Commissioners in 1937
issued debentures totalling $20,456,000 in connection with refunding operations under the
authority of its Act of incorporation, chapter
26 of the Statutes of 1911, and the provisions
of chapter Il of the Statutes of 1936.
The Commissioners now wish to refund an
instalment of principal of the refunding debentures issued in 1937, antounting to $5,000,000,
which becomes due on September 1, 1942, and
doubt has been expressed as to the power of
the Commissioners under existing legislation to
borrow money by the issue of debentures to pay
and redeem debentures which were themselves
refunding debentures such as this instalment
of $5,000,000.
Upon application of the Commissioners it is
now proposed to clarify the matter so that no
doubt will arise as to the power of the Commissioners to renew or refund original or
renewal or refunding debentures.
I think this note fully explains the purpose
of the Bill.
Hon. Mr. COPP.

DESTRUCTION OF BANANAS

AT

ANSWER TO INQUIRY

Hon. Mr. KING:
Honourable senators,
before adjournment I wish to present a report
in answer to certain articles which appeared
in the Halifax Herald with reference to the
destruction of bananas in Halifax harbour.
The matter was brought to our attention by
the honourable senator from Bedford-Halifax

concerned:
On April 30 there reached Halifax a cargo of
bananas, a considerable portion of which was
in an overripe condition and proved to be

appears to have been due to war shipping conditions, causes entirely beyond the control of
either the exporter or the importer. I understand that part of the shipment was given away
by the owners to certain charitable institutions.
None of the shipmeint was dumîped in the harbour proper. The spoiled bananas were ren.oved
from the wharf by the Harbour Board and put
in a special dump at pier 40. It moay be possible that some of the bananas were removed
from pier 40 by truck drivers entirely without
the consent of the Harbour Board. I understand it is reported that some exven turned up
in the Northwest Arm. If so, I an assured by
the harbour authorities that they were nmoved
by truck drivers or other unauthorized persons
from the harbour dunp and placed there.

REPORT OF COMMITTEE

Hon. F. B. BLACK presented, and moved

Bill 16, an Act to authorize the Governor in
Council to enter into agreements with the
governments of the provinces of Canada
respecting the vacation by the provinces of
the personal income and corporation tax
fields for the duration of the war.
He said: Honourable senators, the Banking
and Commerce Committee have had this

the same with the following amendments:

It will be noted that the total payments
required to be made to the provinces, excluding
any payments on account of the guarantee of
gasoline tax revenues, amount to $84,427,643.90.
This compares with a total yield from personal
income and corporation taxes temporarily
vacated by the provinces and their municipalities of $77,140 during the fiscal year of the
provinces ending nearest to December 31, 1940.
(It is possible that had the provinces and the
municipalities retained these taxes, their revenues from these sources of taxation might
have gone on increasing during the war, particularly revenues from corporation taxes.)
The total fiscal need subsidies amount to
$3,234,436.63, which compares with a total of
(P.E.I.

Another slight amendment, simply a change
in wording, was suggested by the Minister of
Finance. I shall move that amendment on
the motion for third reading.
The motion was agreed to.
Hon. Mr. KING: Honourable members,
during our discussion in committee this morning the honourable senator from Pictou (Hon.
Mr. Tanner) intimated that it would be well
to have on record a statement showing details
of the payments required to be made to the
provinces each year as a result of the
Dominion-Provincial tax agreements. With the
consent of the Senate, I now place this information on Hansard:
The following table shows in detail the payments required to be made to the provinces
each year as a result of the Dominion-Provincial

SUBSIDIES BILL

REPORT OF COMMITTEE

Hon. F. B. BLACK, Chairman of the Committee on Banking and Commerce, presented
the report of the committee on Bill 17, an
Act to provide for the payment of additional
subsidies to the Maritime Provinces.
He said: The committee have examined this
Bill and hig to report it without amendment.
I may add, hovever, that a change has been
agreed to by the Law Clerk and the representative of the department. The necessary
amendment to effect this change will be
moved on the motion for third reading of the
Bill.
THIRD READING

Hon. Mr. KING mioved the third reading
of the Bill.
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: Before the Bill is
read a third time I should like to move the
following amendmcnt:
Page 2, lines 16 and 17. Leave out the words
"of the said provinces" and insert the words
"such province."
As amended the proviso will read:
Provided the said subsidies shall not be payable to any such province while an agreement
under the provisions of the Dominion-Provincial
Taxation Agreement Act, 1942, remains in force
with respect to such province.
Hon. Mir. HAIG: Is that change agreed to
by the Minister?
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: Yes.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: I am very sorry,
but I really do not know what it is that we
are asked to vote upon, and I should like
the honourable gentleman who moved the
amendment, or someone else, to explain in
such a way that we can hear.
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: For the benefit of
the honourable senator from Parkdale (Hon.
Mr. Murdock), and others, I may say that
there was some doubt as to the meaning
of the language of the proviso to section 2
of Bill 17 in the form in which it originally
appeared. It was feared that it might mean
that any province withdrawing from the
Dominion-Provincial Taxation Agreement, so
long as any other province remained within
Hon. Mr. BLACK.

the scope of the agreement, could not claim
the benefits of this Bill. It was felt that the
words "such province" should be substituted
for the words "of the said provinces," to make
it perfectly clear that any of the Maritime
Provinces by withdrawing from the DominionProvincial Taxation Agreement ecould get the
benefit of the payments provided for. It is
for clarification.
The amendment was agreed to.
The motion for the third reading was agreed
to, and the Bill was read the third time, and
passed.
MILITARY TRAINING-ALLEGED

Hon. Mr. ROBINSON moved the second
reading of Bill P3, an Act for the relief of
Leah May Jarvis Traver.
He said: Honourable senators, the reason
I did not include this Bill in the motion I
made a few moments ago was that I thought
an honourable gentleman might want to say
something about this case. I now move
second reading.
Hon. Mr. GOUIN: Honourable senators,
the honourable gentleman from Sorel (Hon.
Mr. David) desires to make some remarks
concerning this Bill, and he asked me to
request that the second reading be not proceeded with before ou. next sitting.
Hon. Mr. ROBINSON: That is agrecable.
The motion for second reading stands.
CANADA

EVIDENCE BILL

SECOND READING

Hon. J. H. KING moved the second reading of Bill 66, an Act to amend the Canada
Evidence Act.
He said: Honourable senators, this is an
enactment to enable governments, banks,
railway and express companies, telegraph and
telephone companies and insurance companies
to use as evidence photographie copies in lieu
of original records. The idea is that much less
space is required for storage of films than of
the actual documents themselves. It is said
that 2,600 sheets of letter size can be recorded
on one photographic film of 200 feet, at a cost
of about seven dollars a film. The process is
so speedy that twenty-five sheets can be
photographed on both sides in one minute.
By the use of a projecting machine, which
throws an enlarged picture upon a screen,
the photographed record can be examined
When a particular document is
readily.
required for evidence, an enlarged print may
be easily obtained from the film.
This process, I understand, is in use in the
United States, and five of our provinces have

passed legislation along the lines of the
present Bill. If a government body, bank or
company covered by the Bill wished to destroy
old records which it is now obliged to keep,
a microfilm would be made and an affidavit
executed by the photographer and the person
who destroyed the original record. If in
future it became necessary to use any of
these records in evidence, an enlargement of
the film, submitted to the court with a copy
of the affidavit, would be received as evidence
of what the original record contained. I
think that is all I need say. Some of our
legal friends may care to discuss the matter.
Hon. L. COTE: Honourable senators, I
have read the report of the discussion on this
Bill in the other House. The Bill was promoted by the Minister of Justice, who, I
should judge from the discussion, considered
it very thoroughly and in his usual able way.
That in itself is a recommendation in favour
of the measure. I think nothing can be said
against the principle of the Bill. The moment
this measure became law it would be applicable to procedure in federal courts and with
regard to matters governed by federal law;
for instance, in cases under the Criminal Code.
But I understand that provincial legislation
would be required before the new rule of
evidence would become effective in other
places.
Hon. Mr. KING: Except in the provinces
that have already adopted similar legislation.
Hon. Mr. COTE: Except in provinces where
similar legislation has already been adopted.
That is quite right. Personally I have no
objection to the Bill. I certainly do not
object to second reading. It has been suggested by some members on this side of the
House that in order to understand better,
not only the meaning, but also the scope of
this proposed amendment to the Evidence Act,
there should be a reference to the Committee
on Banking and Commerce. I wonder
whether the honourable leader would consent
to that procedure, as there is no urgency
about the Bill.
Hon. Mr. KING: There is no urgency, and
I cannot see any objection to a reference to
the committee.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill
was read the second time.
REFERRED TO COMMITTEE

On motion of Hon.' Mr. King, the Bill
was referred to the Standing Committee on
Banking and Commerce.

General was pleased to retire.

ASSENT

Hon. Mr. KING: Honourable senators, I
move that when the Senate adjourns to-day
it stand adjourned until Tuesday, June 9, at
8 o'clock in the evening.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: May I suggest what I
believe will be acceptable to the honourable
leader of the Government,-that the Clerk of
the Senate be instructed to notify by wire
those senators who live at a distance from
Ottawa whether there will be a further adjournment shortly after June 9. I do not like
to find, on coming down here, that the Senate
is about to adjourn after being in session only
a couple of days.
Hon. Mr. BARNARD: I would say the
trouble of the honourable member who has
just taken his seat (Hon. Mr. Haig) is that
he does not live far enough away from
Ottawa. If he did, Le would accept these
adjournments quite philosophically.
Hon. Mr. KING: It would be pretty hard
for the Clerk to determine what distance from
Ottawa should entitle a senator to receive the
notice suggested. So J think we shall have to
leave things as they are.
The motion was agreed to.
The Senate adjourned during pleasure.
THE ROYAL ASSENT
The Honourable Thibaudeau Rinfret, acting
as Deputy of the Governor General, having
come and being seated at the foot of the
Throne, and the House of Commons having
been summoned, and being come with their
Speaker, the Honourable the Deputy of the

INQUIRY

Hon. Mr. TANNER inquired of the Government:
1. What was the total expenditure of the
Government in acquisition of properties, construction work and other incidental costs
(including the value of the old Post Office
building and its dernolition, and costs of providing a new Post Office building; but not
including the cost of the War Menorial) for
the purposes of Confederation Park and the
boulevard between Sparks street and Laurier
avenue in the City of Ottawa?
2. What was the total cost to the Government
of the lands that are leased to the Lord Elgin
Hotel Company at Elgin street; and on what
terms is such property leased to said company?
3. Does the Government now own all the
properties between Queen street and Laurier
avenue at the west side of Elgin street? What
does the country pay for each of those
properties?
4. Is the Government providing for and paying through its Federal District Commission the
costs of repairs, renewals and caretaking of
Confederation Park and the boulevard roadways?
5. Did the Federal District Commission perform the work and pay the costs of reducing
the size of the traffic island at the junction of
Elgin street and Laurier avenue?
6. Did the Federal District Commission perform the work and pay the costs of restoring
sidewalks and grass plots and making roadways
at the west side of Elgin street fronting the
hotel building after the hotel was erected?

181

JUNE 9, 1942
7. Has the Government or any branch of
government service any control or supervision
of traffic and parking on the said roadway
boulevards?
8. Is the Government aware that the boulevard roadway at the west side of Elgin street
is constantly used for car parking purposes, and
that the sodding alongside the sidewalks at
both roadways is being persistently destroyed;
and will steps be taken to correct this vandalism
and preserve the park and boulevards on which
great sums of Dominion and city public money
have been invested to create a district of
historic interest and scenic beauty?
9. It is a fact, is it not, that the total War
Memorial outlay was $292,796 or thereabouts?
Hon. Mr. KING: Honourable senators, in
reply to this inquiry I would give the following information:

Total, $2,828,635.46.
$1,080,667.59.
There is no information as to the value of
the old Post Office building at time of demolition. The original building was built in 1876
at a cost of $242,856.73. A further expenditure of $341,897.99 was made for the restoration of the building after the fire of 1904, and
for alterations and repairs since erection.

protocol entered into at Washington on the
4th day of March, 1942, by the Government of
Canada and the Government of United States
of America concerning rates of income tax upon
non-resident individuals and corporations, the
avoidance of double taxation, the prevention of
fiscal evasion in the case of income tax, and the
exchange of certain fiscal information, and that
this House do approve of the same.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: Honourable
senators, there are two points I should like
the Minister to throw some light upon.
Canadians who pay a sizable income tax have
been allowed to deduct the United States tax
of 27J per cent, and I notice in the remarks
of the Minister in another place that refunds
will be made. How will these refunds be
made? And how will Canadians who have
already had the 27J per cent deducted from
their income tax be dealt with?
Hon. Mr. KING: I think the arrangement
is that United States corporations will return
to Canadian investors the amount of taxation
over and above the rate now fixed.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: Will the Gov..
ernment raise no objection in regard to those
who have already benefited by the 271 per
cent deduction?
Hon. Mr. KING: Benefited?
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: Yes.

182

SENATE

Hon. Mr. McRAE: I should think it would
be obvious that the Government might be
expected to revamp the return for 1941 so
that our income tax would apply to the
exemption allowed on the tax already paid in
the United States. Canadian taxpayers, when
they get a refund on the 27½ per cent deduction made in the United States, will be so
much ahcad, uniess the Government of Canada
collects a percentage as tax on that refund.

BUSINESS OF THE SENATE
Hon. Mr. KING: Honourable senators, it
is disappointing to flnd there is no other business on the Order Paper. We had hoped to
deal with a number of bills to-night, but
unfortunately there bas been delay in another
place. However, I believe legislation will
reach us to-morrow. I move that the Senate
do now adjourn.

Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: I should like
to get that statement direct from the
Minister.

The Senate adjourned until to-morrow at
3 p.m.

Hon. Mr. KING: I think that is the understanding. However, I am only giving notice
of motion now, and the point raised by my
honourable friend opposite will be open for
discussion to-morrow. The benefit which the
individual receives in the refund from the
American corporation will undoubtedly be
taxable when it appears in his 1941 or 1942
tax return.

THE SENATE

Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: I do not want
to rise too often, but that explanation is not
cloar enough for me.
Hon. Mr. KING: That is the information
given me.
Hon. Mr. COPP: There is only a notice of
motion now before the House. The time for
discussion will come to-morrow.
Hon. Mr. McRAE: I think if the honourable leader of the House would ascertain from
the Treasury Department how the refund will
be dealt with, the explanation could be given
to the Senate to-norrow, and there would be
no disappoiniment throughout the country.
Hon. Mr. KING: I think the Minister
cleared up the matter in the other House.

INCOME TAX CONVENTION BETWEEN
CANADA AND UNITED STATES
RESOLUTION OF APPROVAL

Hon. J. H. KING moved:
That it is expedient that the Houses of
Parlianent do approve of tho convention and
protocol entered into at Wasbington on the
4th day of March, 1942, by
ic Governmnent
of Canada and the Government of United States
of Amserica concerning rates of incone tax upon
non-resident individuals and corporations, the
avoidance of double taxation, the prevention of
fiscal evasion in the case of incorne tax, and
the exchange of certain fiscal information, and
that this House do approve of the same.

JUNE 10, 1942
He said: Honourable senators, this motion
becomes necessary in order that the Parliament
of Canada may formally approve of the convention and protocol for the avoidance of
double taxation and the prevention of fiscal
evasion in respect of income tax.
It might be well to review briefly the history
of these extraterritorial taxes. In 1933, for
the first time, Canada imposed a 5 per cent
tax deduction in respect of dividends and
certain interest payments leaving the country.
It was not until three years later that the
United States imposed a corresponding tax
deduction at the rate of 10 per cent. In 1936,
as a result of negotiations. a convention was
entered into between the two countries
whereby parity of deduction was brought
about and the tax fixed at 5 per cent. That
rate remained in effect until April, 1941, when
Canada increased her tax on dividends arising
in the United States to 15 per cent. This
automatically abrogated the convention. At
that time the law of the United States required
a tax deduction of 16j per cent. In 1941 this
tax was raised to 27 per cent, and during the
last three months of 1941 it was deducted at
the source from dividends or interest originating in the United States and payable to
Canadian resident holders of United States
securities.
The discrepancy between the 271 per cent
tax imposed by the United States and the 15
per cent levied by Canada became the subject
of negotiation with a view to parity of deduction. The agreement arrived at is embodied
in the present convention. Broadly speaking,
it reduces the United States tax deduction at
the source from 271 to 15 per cent, which
brings it into line with our tax deduction.
Certain extraterritorial features are eliminated. By way of example: the United
States law imposed a tax on any Canadian
company 50 per cent or more of whose
revenue was derived from sources within the
United States, if the income was accumulated
by a recipient Canadian company, and a
Canadian who received dividends from a
Canadian company which got 50 per cent of
its revenue from the United States was liable
to taxation under the United States extraterritorial law. We are excluded from those
provisions by the agreement.
Prior to 1936 the United States revenue
officials undertook to collect taxes from
Canadians who had dealings, through Canadian brokerage houses, with the stock exchanges of the United States. Many claims
ante-dated 1929. It was represented that
profits or gains made on the sale of securities
would be taxable. In many cases the claims
were resisted by Canadian taxpayers on the

183

ground that they were not carrying on business in the United States, and were not
subject to the revenue laws of that country.
For a tine the United States authorities
ceased to press these claims, but in 1932 they
again undertook to enforce their laws, insisting on the right to tax such transactions. This
convention provides for the settlement of
these claims on the basis of the 1936 tax
rate of 5 per cent in respect of any dividends
or interest received from United States securities; and there will be no claim in respect
of any capital gains on stock market
transactions.
It should be noted that any person in
Canada who wishes to take advantage of this
convention must within two years from the
date of the convention apply to Washington
for a settlement on the basis outlined. If he
does not do so, the law as formerly asserted
by the United States may again be imposed
against him.
It is pointed out that if a United States
company doing business in Canada, or vice
versa, is being taxed on more than 100 per
cent of its profits, by reason of the apportionment of profits, it can ask for a conference
between representatives of the two governments with a view to securing an adjustment.
The convention also provides for an exchange of information pertaining to the payment of dividends, interest and other fixed
periodic payments; and, finally, if the authorities of one of the contracting states are
under the belief that the other country is
being used as a basis of perpetrating fiscal
fraud, a request may be made for special
information in relation to the person who is
believed to be committing the fraud.
There are minor features of the convention
which are self-explanatory. Charitable organizations, if they come within the terms of
the American law, are exempted.
The convention will be beneficial to all
Canadians who receive income from sources
within the United States, not only in the tax
reduction from 271 per cent to 15 per cent,
but by reason of the fact that they will have
returned to them the amount in excess of
15 per cent that has been collected since
April, 1941. It will also be beneficial to the
revenues of Canada, inasmuch as amounts
which have been deducted in the United
States from income taxable in Canada will
now come to Canada and be taxable here.
I think that is all I have to say in regard
to the resolution.
Hon. C. C. BALLANTYNE: Honourable
senators, in view of the complete and full explanation the Minister bas been good enough

SENATE
t.o give to the Huse, I for one can take no
objection to the convention. I tbink it is a
very good thing that we have made such an
arrangement with our neighbours to the seuth,
and I arn satisfied that it will work out beneficially to both sides. The convention, wben
it becomes law, wilI be especially helpful to
the Canadians wbo, in a small way, have
bought American securities. Heretofore 27ý
per cent was dedueted; now the deductien
wilI be only 15 per cent.
I have great
pleasure in gix inýg my entire approval to the
convention.
Hon. A. D. McRAE: Honourable senators,
1 think the convention is a splendid working
arrangement. The United States Government
last, year increased its withlbolding tax te 27-2L
per cent for the obvious reason that securities
held in the United States by people of other
countries, particularly of Europe, were not
contributing sufficicntly to the war, and that
tax was probably the one avenue tbrough
which it could get a substantial contribution
from foreigners who were taking advantage
of the Amnerican invest.rnent market for
securities. As the honourable leader lias stated,
the prcvious convention was nullificd by oui,
increasing the Canadian tax to 15 per cent;
so, we wcre left in the samne position as Europeans icvesting in the United States and
became subject to the deduction of 271, per
cent.
It would hiave been very natural for our
Governmcnt, in the ncw budget, if the present
arrangement had not beon mnade, to increase
its witbbolding tax from 15 per cent to 271.
per cent; and 1 tbink it is not, amiss to state
that te do so would bave been very advantageous to the treasury of Canada. As it is
said, there is eight times as mucb Americau
money invested in corporations in Canada as
there is Canadian moncî inve,,tecd in the
United States; consequently, by making our
witbbolding tax tbe samne as tbe American.
we probably could bave brougbt back to oui
treasury eiglit times as mîieh as wo sboul'l
have liad to pay out through licheeduction
made on the othor side of the boundary. I
tbink that is clear. So, froni the point of
vicw of the treasury alone, the logical tbîng
would probablv bave bcen for us to increase
ocr tax rate to make it equal tha t of the
United Statos--a procodîîrc Io wbich no objection whatcx or could have been takon.
On the other hand, a good many complications bave arisen under these witbbiolding
taxes. Smaller invcstors bave been obliged
te suifer, inasrnucbl as flic xx iolding tax ie
the United States was more tlîan the withholding tax bore. This adjustmcnt, corrects
that, at loast to some extent.
Ilon. Mr-. BALLANTYNE:

I was interested in the remarks of the bonourable leader in regard te what are called
capital gains, for whicb dlaimis have been
made in the United States for a number of
years. I notice that those who have net
settled heretofore can now settle on the basis
of 5 per eent.
Wbat I amn intorested in,
however, is whother the provision is retroactive, and whetber those w-ho bave met the
demands of the United States cani now state
their case with any hope of getting a refund,
se that ail may be treated aliko.
By and large, I think Ibis convention is
(lesirable, and I sec ne objection te it except
for the one peint I have raised.
If the
bonourable leader could find eut abeut that
for us, I arn sure it would ho of interest te
many people who have paid the tax.

TRAVER DIVORCE BILL
TIIIRD) READING

Hon. C. W. ROBINSON moved the third
reading of Bill F3. an Act for the relief of
Leabi May Jarvis Traver.
He said: Honourable senators, in mevieg
the third readixîg of this Bilt I have thougbt
it advisable te put on record sometbing as te
why the eemmittee recemmeeded its passage.
The potitioner. Mrs. Traver, is 47 years of
age; the rospondent. Mr. Traver, is 51. They
were marricil in April, 1927, and livcd together
until 1933. Ie 1933, as Mrs. Travor stated in
evidonce, conditions became unbearable and
slie could net live with ber husband; and in
Octeber cf tba-t vear a ,Judgment was rendered
by tbe Superior Court in Qucbec, separating
the parties as maci and xxife.
Mrs. Traver stated in evideece that ber
biîshend never supported lier; that she was
taking roomers, and going out at niglit te look
after otlier people's cbildrcn; that she sold
coal on a commission basis and Mr. Traver
collccted the money duc ber, beforo she bcd a

Mr. Traver opened the dçoor; that they got
into the shack; that there was only one room
in the place; that there was just a double bcd,
and that a woman was covered up in the bed.
Later evidence from the respondent, Mr.
Traver, and also from a Mr. Charles Budd
(page 33 of the, evidence) woyuld appear to
prove conclusively that this shack in the
woods-one, it is said, of about eighty similar
shacks-was not a one-room shack or cottage,
but that there were three or four rons in the
place.

The two investigators also stated, and
repeatedly insisted, that when Mr. Traver
opened the door and let tbem into the shack
he turned on an electrie ligbt. Later evidence
appeared to show conclusively that there were
no electrie

ligbts within five miles of that

partieular spot.
From the evidence of the detectives it would

appear to be possible that they did not geV
into tbe shack at aIl, but only saw the inside
of the shack through the open window wben
Mr. Traver was turning a flashlight on them
and answering their questions.

Later it was sworn by Mr. Traver that Miss
Empey was not at the shack on October 10,
1941, but bad gone away some days previously.
By reference to page 27 of the divorce proceedings it will be noted tbat Mr. Traver
admitted he and 'Louise Empey lived in tilis
shack for many weeks or months. This being
the case, and the background being that man
and wife had been separated since 1933,
divorce appears to be duly warranted.
It should be here noted that Mr' Traver
himself admitted that this cottage or sback was
about eighteen feet by eigbteen feet, and (on
pages 26 and 27 of the report) that he and
Miss Empey lived there during the summer
time. H1e said that she had ber portion of

VILLAGE 0F LIDICE
DISCUSSION

On the Orders of the Day:
Hon. A. K. HUGESSEN: Honourable
senators, before the Orders of the Day are
called, I wish to direct the attention of the
Senate to a matter of urgent national and,

186

SENATE

Words, of course, are quite insufficient to
describe the horror that every one of us feels
at this crime, and to express our deep commiseration with the inhabitants of the unfortunate land of Czechoslovakia, and also with
those in this country who are of Czech blood
and ancestry.
But it is not for that purpose that I have
risen this afternoon. It is to make a suggestion by which this foul outrage can be
avenged and its repetition perhaps prevented.
I hasten to say that this is not a suggestion
originating with myself. It was made about
a week or ten days ago by that well-known
columnist Dorothy Thompson in her daily
column; and no doubt a number of honourable
senators have read it. But it derives additional significance from the crime of Lidice.
It is a suggestion which is made possible by
the great and growing superiority of the Allied
Nations over the air of Western Europe.
It is this. The Allies should now announce
over every radio, to occupied Europe and to
Germany, that Lidice has been destroyed, and
that they intend to take immediate vengeance
by bombing out of existence one or more
villages in the beart of Germany. The general
districts in which these villages are situated
should be specified, but not, of course, the
villages themselves.
That would ensure a
general state of terror and alarm throughout
the districts mentioned. Then the Allied forces
should proceed at the first favourable opportunity to wipe out a German village in each
of these districts. After that they should make
the widest possible announcement over the
European radio of what they have done and
why they hiave donc it, and give notice that
it will be donc again if the Nazi authorities
perpetrate any further crimes like the crime
of Lidice.
Quite apart from the question of vengeance,
as Miss Thompson says, such a course of action
would have two obvious advantages. Firstly,
if anything will deter the Nazis from repeating
this crime, that will do it. Their own people
will have suffered as a direct result of their
action. and every village throughout Germany
will have a vital interest in preventing a repetitien. Second]v, and far more important, it
will have a grcat effect on the morale of the
conquered peoples of Europe. They wilI know
and will realize that their sufferings are being
watced by powerful allies, and that each
specific crime committed against them by the
masters of the German people is being at once
avenged in kind upon the German people.
After all, honourable senators, these Czechs
are our allies. We count on them now for
acts of sabotage against the German forces,
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN.

and we shall have to count on them still more
when the Allied Nations invade the continent
of Europe, as they inevitably will. I say we
count on them. They in turn have a right to
count on us. We are in honour bound to do
everything we can to bolster their morale, to
show them that their heroic struggle is not
in vain, and to encourage them to go on.
That is one thing that our military chiefs can
do now, and that is why, it seems to me, Miss
Thompson's suggestion should now be brought
to their attention. It is, of course, merely a
suggestion. No civilian could do anything
more than make a suggestion to the Allied
military authorities. No civilian is in a position to judge and properly estimate all the
factors of material, power, munitions and so
forth that are involved. Therefore it can only
be a suggestion coming from the civilian
population. But I think I can confidently say
this: if the Allied military authorities decide
to adopt such a course, it will meet with the
enthusiastic approval, net only of this House,
but of this country.
Hon. J. A. CALDER: Honourable members, may I say a word in reference to this
matter which has just been brought up? I
am sure we are all absolutely horrified at what
took place and bas been reported. When I
read it in the Press I could net help saying
to myself, "Something must be done te stop
wxhat is occurring in the world." I had net
read Miss Dorothy Thompson's article and did
net know thit she had made the suggestions
just referred te.
The United Nations have very distinctly
told Germany that if she uses gas, they will
use gas in abundance. We all know what the
use of gas means, and the results of it.
Briefly, what the United Nations have done
is this: they have simply said, "You shall
eot use that horrible thing and cause those
terrible sufferings which result frein gas; but
if y-ou do use it, you shall be punished."
In the saine way the Allied Nations have
served very definite notice on Japan. Japan
lias been using gas on civil populations. Cas
could not be used iover England to any great
extent without reaching the civil population.
Weil, to my mind, this horror that is
occurring in Europe is worse than any gas
used in war, and I thoroughly agree with what
the honourable gentleman from Inkerman
(Hon. Mr. Hugessen) has said, that it is
time to do something about it. We do net
like the idea of vengeance, but how in the
world are these horrible things to be stopped
uinless the people who are doing them are
taught a lesson? They would never be
stopped; they would go from bad to worse,

JUNE 11, 1942

as they have done already. The United Nations
Must tell Germany and her allies very
definîtely that they cannot do these things
unless tbey are prepared to take the consequences. And let us see to it that, if the
things are done, the consequences shall be
applied. What action should be taken and how
it should be taken, I do not know, but I amn
thorougbly in sympathy with the idea that
has been put forth by the honourable senator
from. Inkerman.
WAR APPROPRIATION

BILL NO. 2

SECOND READING

Hon. J. B. KING moved the second reading
of Bill 95, an Act for granting to Bis Majesty
aid for national defence and securit.y.
He said: Bonourable senators, uEually this
House does not spend a great deal of time on
financial buis corning from the Bouse of
Commons, but this measure is a littie different
from the ordinary supply bill, in the fact
that it provides the appropriation which the
Government is asking Parliament to grant
for carrying on Canada's war effort during
the fiscal ycar ending March 31, 1943. The
appropriation for our direct war expenditure
during the year will amount to two billion
dollars, less the $500,000,0O0 which we voted
before Easter in an interim. supply billI. It
will also be remembered, and I think I should
refer to it, that at that time we passied what
is known as the War Appropriation (United
Kingdom. Financing) Bill, providing one billion
dollars. A srnall portion of that appropriation
had been expcnded during last year. The
rest will be used this year ta finance
Great Britain's purchases in Canada of foodstuiffs, munitions and so forth. So in these
two Bills the Canadian Parliament is voting
this year three billion dollars ta be used
directly or indirectly for war purposes.
An examination of the Bill will show that,
in the first place, it votes at this time a
maximum of two billion dollars for war purposes; secondly, that it authorizes the Governor in Council to borrow, by the issue and
sale of securities, up ta two billion dollars,
ta pay for any of the expenditures covered by
this Bill and the War Appropriation Act No.
1; and, thirdly, that it empowers the Government ta act as agent of any British or Allied
Governrnent and in this capacity ta incur
ternporary obligations or costs, which are
recoverable fromn tbe Governmcnt eoncerned
In introducing this measure ta the other
Bouse, the Minister of Finance indicated the
allotment that would be made ta each of the

187

war departments. I think it wouhd be well ta
place these figures on our Bansard. They are
as follows:
National Def ence
Army Services.... $997,000,000
Naval Services. .. 259,000,000
585,000,000

Some Hon. SENATORS:

Rear, bear.
Hon. Mr. RIN'LG: As to the original Air
Training Plan, I notice this morning in tbe
Press a rather interesting staternent which I
sîud
like to place on Hansard. The Rigbt

JUNE 11, 1942

Hon. Malcolm MacDonald, British High
Commissioner to Canada, in addressing the
Canadian Club in Toronto last week, had this
to say:
Two years ago Prime Minister Winston
Churchill was inclined to underrate the imaportance of the Commonwealth Air Training
Plan in Canada, believing that other things
were more important and po-werful itemat in
the war plan. But to-day Mr. Churchill believes it to be one of the greatest and most
irresistible forces at our command.
Some Hon. SENATORS:

Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. KING: I should like to direct
the attention of bonourable senators to the
rapid increase in our war expenditures since
1939. For the fiscal year 1941-42 the Estimates
showed total war expenditures of $1,431,000,000,
as against a total of only $118,000,000 for
the fiscal year ending Mare.h 31, 1940. A
comparîson of these figures shows bow rapidly
our war effort bias been growing and its cost
increasing, ilonourable members may recaîl
that the total cost to Canada of the last
war was estimated at about $1,680,000,000.
This year we are likely to spcnd on our direct
war effort alone substantially more than the
total cost of tbe last war.
If we examine the Bill in detail we shall
find that section 2 is the main operative section. It provides for the grant of 82,000,000.000,
less the sum already votcd, towards defraying
any expenses or making any advances or loans
that may be incurred or granted by or under
the authority of the Governor in Council during the year ending March 31, 1943, for war
purposes. In this section provision is made
for the allotment of funds hy the Treasury
Board. It has been found that in practice it is
desirable to provide that the Treasury Board
shall check estimates and allot funds after
the Governor in Council bas approved of the
principle of specific projects. It may also
be noted that any money received as a rcfund
or repayment of any advance, boan or expenditure made under the authority of previous
War Appropriation Acts or of the new Act
may, with the approval of the Governor in
Council, be expended, advanced or loaned for
the purposes mentioned in tbe Bill.
Section 3 enables the Government of
Canada to act as the agent of the Government of any British or other Allied country
for any purpose which will aid directly or
indirectly in the prosecution of the war,
and any obligations or costs incurred temporarily or assumed by tbe Government of
Canada, acting in its capacity as sucb agent,
may be paid out of any unappropriated
moneys in the Consolidated Revenue Fund.
This provision, which is subsection 1 of
section 3, bas been in aIl War Appropriation

189

Acts since the heginning of tbe war. Subsection 2 bas been added in the present
Bill to make it possible for tbe Government
to advance funds for the payment. temporarily of expenses that may be incurred by
Covernment-owned corporations set up to
place orders for any British or foreign country
allied witb His Majesty.
It is understood
that this La desired primarily to enable the
Government to advance funds to War Supplies Limited, a Government-owned corporation whicb accepts war contracts fromn United
States Government agencies. The Corporation
must, be enabled to make progress payments;
to, Canadian manufacturers, and wben the
project bas been completed and delivered
to the United States agency it will be recouped for the payments so made.
Section 4 is a standard clause giving the
power to borrow, if necessary, for the purposes of the Act up to a maximum of
$2,000,000,000.
Section 5 merely gives the Governor ini
Council power to make such orders or regulations as may be deemed necessary to give
effect to the purposes of the Act.
And section 6 provides that when the
Treasury Board bas made an allotment of
any part of tbe appropriation to provide for
the cost of any service, tbe Minister of
Finance shall cause an accounting record to
be maintained in a formi tbat will disclose
the financial commitmnents entered into and
the expenditures made.
With this explanation I move second reading
of the Bill.
Hon. C. C. BAILANTYNE: Honourable
senators, as tbe bonourable leader bas pointed
out, it is a well-known fact, in theory at least,
that this Chamber bas flot authority to alter
a money bill. Furthermore, we should bave
no desire to do so, especially in tbis case,
wben the $2,000,000,000 is required principally
for war purposes. I tbink I arn safe in saying,
however, tbat neyer before bas there been
placed before Parliament a money bill that
covered so wide a field, including, as it does,
flot only the three fighting services, but also
price control, subsidies, and other expenditures
that you see listed on the last page of the

Bill.
The present Prime Minister said to me flot
long ago tbat be regretted that senators were
flot more active in debate wben legislation
came before this House.
There is a fine
opportunity here for honourable members to
enter into debate in regard to tbe subjects I
bave just rnentioned. Every senator in this
Chamber bas a special knowledge of flot only
one particular problem, but many. Tberefore,

190

SENATE

if this afternoon there is a more general debate
than usual, I for one shall be much pleased.
I rise, however, this afternoon for one
particular purpose. The greatest problem that
confronts Great Britain and her gallant Allies
at the present time is the shortage of shipping.
All the American ocean ports, including those
of Canada, are chock-a-block with war equipment and supplies, as are also the railways in
both countries, as the result of a great bottleneck caused by a shortage of shipping space.
I regret that the Minister of Munitions and
Supply has been so reticent in giving information with regard to our shipbuilding programme. In fact, he has, so to speak, drawn
a veil of secrecy over it. I cannot understand
why be should do so, in view of the fact that
his colleagues in the Government, such as the
Minister of Defence, the Naval Minister, and
the Minister of Defence for Air, give out full
information about the men in the three combined forces, both here and overseas. As a
matter of fact, only a few weeks ago the
Minister in charge of Naval Services visited
Halifax to drive rivets in the keels of two
destroyers on which construction had just
been commenced, and he was not as modest
as my friend the Minister of Munitions and
Supply: he had movie-camera men there, and
reporters, and the widest publicity was given
to the laying of the keels for these destroyers.
I am not sure, myself, that that was the wise
thing to do. While it nay bu all right to
give out information about cargo ships, I
doubt if it is wise to do so about naval construction, especially when the ships are being
built in the most vulnerable port of Canada.
I desire to read a very brief article to show
what wide publicity the American Press gives
to the shipbuilding programme in the United
States. The heading of this article is: "With
the Victory Fleet. Let's go." Then there is
a song which I will not read. The article says:
Morale building is the big idea behind observance of Maritime Day this year, and this whole
shipbuilding programme is something to give
your spine a tingle. It is not just something
to celebrate on salt water, either. . . . Not
completed ships, of course, but completed subasseniblies. For, thanks to American assembly
line production genius, the building of ocean
vessels now begins with the making of lifeboats, complete with oars and ready to swing
from the davits, at Kokomo, Indiana; the
making of steel plate assemblies at Denver,
the making of switchboard installations at
Plainfield, Connecticut, the making of turbines
at Schenectady, N.Y., and so on.
A full million men are building parts of ships
at these inland plants-parts so complete they
can be timed to arrive just when they are
needed, hoisted into the hulls of the shipyard
ways, riveted or welded into place and be ready
to function.
These million workers are just as much entitled to break a bottle of champagne over a
Hon Mr. BALLANTYNE.

boiler or a reciprocating engine, give a cheer
and sing the song of the Victory Fleet, as their
fellow workmen at tidewater.
Perfection of this technique for shipbuilding
bas done wonders. Originally it was figured
that six months-one hundred and eighty dayswould be required to build a Liberty ship from
keel-laying to comnissioning.
But the time was soon eut to one hundred
andifive days, and as a record of eighty-three
days bas been set, marine engineers now figure
that the average ti me will soon be ninety days.
That's building ships, Mister, in any language.
Let me discontinue for a moment to say
that out in one of the California yards, not
long ago, the building of a 10,000-ton Liberty
ship took only forty-five days from the time
of the laying of the keel until she was fully
commissioned and ready to go to sea.
By the end of 1943 it will be three thousand
new ships completed. Half of them, one thonsand five hundred, will be the 10,000-ton Liberty

ships tiat started out to be called ugly ducklings. Five hundred will be the modern C-type
vessel tiat will form the nucleus of America's
post-war merchant marine. Threa hundred will
be tankers.
Seven hundred will be smaller
ocean tugs and barges.
Smnall wonder, then, they sing the interlude
to this new song of the Victory Fleet.
I quote that merely to show that the United
States authorities do net hold the same view
that my honourable friend the Minister of
Munitions and Supply does. They give the
fullest information of what they are doing in
regard to the construction of ships.
Hon. Mr. KING: I do net wish to interrupt the honourable gentleman, but I think I
should interject here that Mr. Howe informed
me just recently that he is under obligation
to the British and American Governments, for
whom the majority of these ships are being
built, net to disclose the number.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: I am coming to
that. If Mr. Howe does net disclose it, perhaps I may state that the Chairman of the
Shipbuilding Committee does.
Hon. Mr. KING: He may have erred.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE:
Oh, no. Here
is what the Chairman said in making a speech
before the Canadian Club in Montreal. He
said the Canadian Government had contracted
for one hundred and seventy-two ships,
eighteen being of 4,600 tons, and the rest of
10,000 tons. That is the Chairman's statement.
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: What is the date of
that?
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: A few weeks
ago.
In addition to that, the Chairman of the
Shipping Board came back from Washington
and announced that he had an order froin the

191

JUNE 11, 1942

United States Government for 125 ships ta be
built in Canada and paid for under the Hyde
Park agreement. There does not seem ta be
very much co-operation between the Minister
and the Chairman.
Hon. Mr. COPP: The information being
given, it does not much matter who gives it,
I suppose.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: There is nothing
secret about the building of cargo ships, and
my honourable friend will agree, I think, that
Parliament bas a right to know how this shipbuilding programme is going. It is the duty
of the Minister to tell Parliament from time
to time, in a full and complete way, what he
is doing and how he is getting on, just as it
was my privilege to inform Parliament during
the last war.
Now I quote a few brief statements the
Minister made recently. I will give the best
one first:
We have perhaps two yards in Canada that
are fully manned; the other seventeen yards
are still in process of expansion. One new
large six-berth yard in Montreal laid down its
first keels last week. At the present time we
are launching a 10,000-ton merchant ship every
four days, and we expect later on ta bring
this period down ta three days.
He does not make very long statements.
Then again, in referring to the type of 10,000ton cargo ships that we are building to-day
and the statement that it might be greatly
improved, lie said:
I may say that this ship was designed particularly ta meet present-day war conditions.
All the designers in England pooled their ideas
to produce the design, which came from England,
and I might say that in the United States and
in Canada that design was accepted with very
I understand that the
slight modifications.
Liberty ship in the United States is slightly,
but only very slightly, different from the
10,000-ton freighter which we are building in
Canada. Both follow the design which is being
used in England for common-type cargo ships.
I have only one more statement, but I
think honourable members will be interested
in hearing from the Minister himself. He
said, speaking in another place:
I might give the committee some information
which would be of interest. To-night at midnight two West Coast yards are each launching
a 10,000-ton freighter. One of them was completed at the yard, in every way, in eighty days
from the time the first piece of steel was laid
for the keel. That is a record up ta this date.
Those two shipyards have just begun a threeshift, seven-day-week operation. They are the
only two yards we have been able ta staff up
fully. I expect that later launchings will show
a still shorter time of construction up te the
point of launching. However, as I have said
ta the committee, we are at the present time
delivering one ship, complete for sailing, every
four days.

Then he makes this further statement:
The industry is constantly expanding. We
never close the door on any industry; we are
always expanding. We have laid keels in a new
six-berth yard within the last week or two in
Montreal. We are expanding berths at Vancouver Island, and we are also bringing in new
berths at Pictou and Sorel. We attempt ta fully
staff one yard before we start on the next.
We have made mistakes; we have opened new
shipyards too soon. Once a yard is fully staffed
and on a full-tin:e basis-we have only two
yards in the country on that basis-it may be
worth while ta start another yard; but while
a yard in a locality is expanding it is not considered good business-and we were so warned
by experts from the United Kingdom-to start
another yard.
Hon. Mr. COPP: May I ask the honourable
gentleman if what he bas just been reading is
a statement by the Minister?
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: Yes.
of the salient
I wish ta indicate some
points of these very brief statements of the
Minister. You will note that he said we
had nineteen yards in Canada, and only two
of them partially manned.
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: Fully manned.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: Oh, no.
Hon. Mr. KING: Only two fully manned.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE:
he said that.

I do not think

Hon. Mr. ROBINSON: Would the honourable senator speak a little louder, se that we
may hear?
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: I do not think
I shall have any trouble in doing that. The
Minister said:
We have perhaps two yards in Canada that
are fully manned.
My honourable friend is right.
Hon. Mr.
"perhaps".

COTE:

The

Minister

said

Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: Yes. Out of
our nineteen yards only two are perhaps
fully manned. After the British expert advised
the Minister that it would be well net to
build any more new yards unless the present
ones were manned, it does seem ta me a
strange procedure for the Minister to be busy
erecting new yards now, especially the one
that he refers te, the six-berth yard at
Montreal.
The Minister makes another statement
that I cannot quite understand, though it
may be clear te my honourable friend from
Westmorland (Hon. Mr. Copp), a Maritimer.
He says:

SENATE
We can hardly build to the capacity of the
yards unless somebody is prepared to man the
boats when built. The department does not
just run wild on a particular type of boat. If,
during the next eight months, the plan is to
train men for, say, twenty boats, we build the
twenty boats. Britain nay ask us to build
fifty for thein; we do it.
I do not see why shipbuilding should be
retarded because Canada is unable to man
the boats.
Every effort should be made
by the Government to build cargo ships as
speedily as possible, and if more ships are
built than we can man, the surplus should
be turned over to England, the United States,
China or Russia.
I will refer to the contracts that have
been awarded for the construction of steel
cargo ships in Canada. I may say bore that
I should net have had this information if
my honourable friend from Pictou (Hon. Mr.
Tanner) bad not placed a question on the
Order Paper.
In response to his question
In January
this information was obtained.
and April, 1941, twenty-six ships were ordered
on account of the United Kingdom, and from
May to October of that year seventy-seven
ships were ordered on account of Canada.
Here is the break-down that was supposed
to bo so very secret:
Total number of ships now contracted for:
(a) On United Kingdoni orders and account26 ships, 10,000 tons, dead weight, each,
approximately.
(b) On Canada's orders and account124 ships, 10,000 tons, dead weight, each,
approximately.
18 ships, 4,700 tons, dead weight, each,
approximately.
But only two ships have been fully commissioned and sent to sea.
There may be reasons for the strikingly
slow progress that bas been made in the
building of ships, and perhaps the honourable
leader (Hon. Mr. King) will be able to
Posenlighten the House when he replies.
sibly there has been a shortage of skilled
and unskilled labour, or structural steel, or
ship-plate.
If any such shortage bas been
responsible for the delay, would it not have
been the right thing for the Minister to say
so in the other House?
While I am on this subject of plates, I
may say I understand that a new plate mill
We have never
bas been built at Sydney.
been informed that that mill is in operation.
Why should Parliament not have been informed about that?
We have never been
told whether or not sufficient plates are being
turned out there to take care of the requiremonts of the shipbuilding programme.
I
have no desire to eriticize unduly or to retard
the Government's efforts, but I do strenuHon. Mr. BALLANTYNE.

ously object to the long delay in this important
matter of shipbuilding, especially when there
is such a fearful shortage of ships. Happily,
on the Atlantic ocean the loss bas been only
one per cent, but in the Caribbean and the
South Seas the losses have been very serious.
I hope my remarks will lead te a greater
effort on the part of the Government, and
particularly of those charged with the duty
of seeing that ships are constructed. If there
actually is a shortage of skilled and unskilled
labour. why net have an announcement made
over the radio, stating the need for men
and the rates of wages? But to go along as
we have been going and t receive a statement that after fourteen months only two
ships have been put into commission-well,
all I can say is. that information is very
disappointing to Parliament and to the public.
I may bo permitted to make a brief reference to the shipbuilding programme in the
last war. We took over all the existing berths,
in fourteen yards. We did net spend any
money on the expansion of those yards, and
we had our ships built at a fixed price. But,
as I mentioned at the commencement of my
remarks, I understand that this Government
bas spent vast sums of money on the expansion
of shipyards, berths, and so on. I sho.ld very
much like the honourable leader ., tell us
the amount that bas been spent in this way,
and aiso whether these yards are Governmentowned. It would be very interesting to know
tlat. I should also like the honourable leader
to tell us, at his convenience, when it is expected the seventeen partially manned yards will
be fully manned, and to give us some indication as to when shipbuilding is to be speeded
up. Why build seventeen yards, at a cost of
millions, and net bo able to man them? Would
it net have been the part of wisdom to sit
down, in the first place, and study the available labour, skilled and unskilled, as well as
the possibilities of getting structural steel and
ship-plates, and thon to expand your shipbuilding programme as you bad the men and
material to carry it along? I shall be very
glad if the honourable leader can show that I
am wrong, but it does look to me as if poor
judgment was used in launohing out quickly
and constructing nineteen yards, with the
result that I have mentioned.
There is only one more subject I want to
touch on. The honourable leader referred to
the expansion of the Canadian Navy. I say
Amen to all his words in commendation of
the Canadian Navy. A splendid effort bas
been made in connection with the Navy, and
there bas been a very fine development. But
somewbat over a year ago, in this House, I
differed with the Minister of National Defence

JUNE 11, 1942
for Naval Services and urged the Government
not to proceed with the construction of
destroyers. I will give now the same reasons
that I gave then. We have not the necessary
expert technicians here, although I understand
the Minister went .to England and probably
has been able to have some experts brought
over. A destroyer will cost at least $5,000,000;
two of them will cost a sum of $10,000,000.
They are armed with 4.7 guns, anti-aircraft
gùns and torpedoes. Of course, destroyers are
néeded, but the need for them is not as pressing as it is for cargo ships. Five or six
cargo ships, each of 10,000 tons, could be built
in a relatively short time for the $10,000,000
that would be spent on two destroyers, whose
construction would require two years. My
honourable friend the leader (Hon. Mr. King)
may not agree with the suggestion I will
make now. He has a good deal of influence
with his Cabinet colleagues and the Government, and I should like him to urge the Goverament to stop this destroyer-building business and to put every man, every dollar and
every ounce of energy possible into the building of cargo ships.
Hon. CREELMAN MacARTHUR: Honourable senators, Prince Edward Island is
considered a pretty poor province. We are
the smallest province in Canada and we are
getting no consideration from the Government. In the recent plebiscite Prince Edward
Island voted Yes; Quebec voted No. Our
gasoline ration coupons are good for two
gallons each, but Quebec's are good for five
gallons. There you are. We have a car
ferry which is nothing but a glorified scow.
Our $2,000,000 boat went to the bottom, and
we can get no satisfaction as to what is being
done about replacing it. Now, Prince Edward
Island will either go along as one of the provinces of Canada, under Confederation, or it
will go otherwise. We will not continue to
put up with things as they are. We have no
transportation service, and we cannot find out
when we are likely to get any. I left home
Sunday to get here. There was no train connection at Tormentine, but we got the bus to
Moncton. We have no car ferry-nothing.
Now, this condition must be remedied; that
is all there is to it. We must have our
transportation difficulties cleared up. We want
honourable members from the Central and
Western Provinces to support our claim for
better transportation facilities. Either Prince
Edward Island will have adequate train and
car ferry services, as one of the nine provinces, or she will go out.
Hon. B. F. SMITH: Has the honourable
senator the full say for Prince Edward Island?

Hon. Mr. MacARTHUR: I have something
to say for it, and you in New Brunswick
should also have something to say in our
support. I repeat, these Prince Edward Island
transportation deficiencies must be made good,
and we are looking to honourable members
from the West and the Middle West to give
us a break. At the present time we are
getting no satisfaction whatever.
Hon. C. E. TANNER: Honourable senators, I have something to add to the remarks
with regard to shipbuilding so forcibly made
by the honourable leader on this side (Hon.
Mr. Ballantyne). I think one is quite safe
in saying that the cargo-shipbuilding programme of the Government has proven to be
the most calamitous and futile of any of its
efforts.
Of course, this Bill comes to us after having
been discussed for a long time in another
place, where relatively few members endeavoured to get information as to how the
war effort is being carried on. I endeavoured
to follow the proceedings in the other House,
and a perusal of the Debates convinced me
that it was very difficult for members to get
information, not because of any lack of d.iligence on their part in seeking it, but because
those in a position to do so were most reluctant to furnish any information.
I think it is worth while calling attention
to the fact that this country has now been at
war for two years and nine months-and, mind
you, we were not dragged into the war. Of
our own volition we declared war, first on
Germany, then on Italy. Parliament met
and authorized those declarations of war.
Then the Government, while Parliiament was
not sitting, forgot all about the pledges it had
given to the country that Canada would never
become involved in war with any nation
without prior parliamentary approval. What
happened? The Government declared war
on Rumania, on Hungary, on Finland, and
then, right off its own bat, on Japan. It
might have been all right for the Government
to do so in the absence of the pledges to
which I have referred, but, these pledges
having been given, it certainly was not all
right for the Government to act without parliamentary approval. I often pondered, when
the Government declared war on Rumania, and
Hungary and Finland, and then on Japan, what
plan of action it had in mind. What did it
intend us to do-to sit down pat and wait for
those nations to invade Canada, or to go out
and meet them? I have never heard any
member of the Cabinet explain just what the
Government intended. Perhaps my honourable
friend opposite (Hon. Mr. Ring) can enlighten us.

walking along after the mob, accosted him
and asked, "Who is the leader of this mob?"
The straggler fellow replied, "I am the leader."
Now I come to the shipping business, and I
have something which I want to put on record
because it corroborates what my honourable
leader bas been saying. In 1941, on January 8,
a man who was in the public service here as
Controller of Ship Construction and Repairs,
was in the city of Halifax. He was interviewed by a representative of the Halifax
Chronicle, which is known to be an historic
supporter of the Liberal party. In that brief
interview this gentleman, made a statement
which is reported in the Chronicle as follows:
The naval and ship construction programme
cannot be extended to Nova Scotia in any great
degree, because you have not got the men nor

the facilities
required.

for

building

the

steel

ships

That is what Mr. D. M. Carswell said-"You
have not got the men nor the facilities for
building the steel ships required."
I saw that statement, and after I came up
to Ottawa I undertook to write a letter to
Mr. Carswell-and I am going to read that
letter. It is dated January 20, 1941, and is as
follows:
The Controller of Shipbuilding and Repairs,
Department of Munitions and Supply,
Ottawa, Ontario.
Dear Sir:
I an referring to a news item (copy enclosed)
that appeared in the Halifax Chronicle, Halifax,
N.S., of the 8th instant. It credits you with
saying at Halifax: "You haven't got the men
nor the facilities for building the steel ships
required." I assun:e that you had in mind the
big steel ships for which Britain has let contracts in British Columbia and on the St.
Lawrence.
I agree that at this moment there are not
in the province plants to take on construction
of such large ships, but that does not dispose of
the matter.

I remind you of certain facts. In other provinces that were not equipped for large war
orders for war materials, great plants have
been created and equipped, and existing plants
have been expanded and equipped, at a cost
to the country of millions of dollars.
These war materials mnust be delivered at the
war fronts. Is it not of vital importance that
there be shipping to make these deliveries, and
also to deliver products of Canada which we
are selling to England?
You will not say,
"Leave it to England to provide the shipping."
I suggest that if it is good policy, and it is,
to create manufacturing plants, it is just as
necessary to establish shipbuilding plants so
that production and transportation will go
band in band.
As to the large tonnage-on what reasoning
are we to be convinced (a) that ships of
snaller tonnage than those ordered by Britain
vould not be of vital service; or (b) that
wooden bottoms would not give practical service?
44567-13J

I have viewed fleets of cargo ships assembled
at eastern Canadian ports. Certainly a large
percentage of them are below the tonnage in
your mind.
J lived in Nova Scotia through the era of
wooden ships. Keels were laid in the winter;
ships were afloat in the spring; and those ships
sailed every world ocean and carried every
description of cargo. That could be done again.
Facilities for wooden shipbuilding are available.
Others could be provided. Relatively they are
not expensive.
When will the big ships contraeted for be
launched? A year hence, or two years? Many
vital events may happen in the meantime.
I suggest that there should not be cornplacency because we are to build freighters for
England.
We are ourselves at war up to our necks.
We declared war on Germany. We declared
war on Italy. We are not merely a country
to which England may come to buy supplies
and carry them away in her own bottoms.
Sone people appear to suffer under that
delusion. We are war-makers; and as Mr.
Churchill says, "There is not a week, nor a
day, nor an hour to be lost." If you read what
he said at Glasgow on Friday last. you will
remenber his words: "Before us lie dangers.
dangers which, if wie neglect anything, will be
fatal, mortal."

Coming to your saying at Halifax, "You
haven't got the men," without any idea of discourtesy, J suggest that you do not really know
Nova Scotia.
During the session of Parliament, last spring,
I listened impatiently to a lot of that kind of
preaching from Government benches. I resented
it, and declared that Canadians. given the
chance, could do anything needed for our war
services. I repeat that.
The decisive answer to such defeatist talk is
that now Canadians are either making or preparing to make what we were told last spring,
they could not make. And it is not long since
the Minister of Munitions gave out to the
public a resounding tribute to the "remarkable
efficiency" of Canadian craftsmen.
J enclose a copy of a letter from Senator
Thomas Cantley, of New Glasgow, published on
the 6th instant in the Halifax Chronicle. I may
say that Senator Cantley was during many years
managing director of the Nova Scotia Steel
Company. While be was head of the company,
they built a fleet of steel cargo ships. In the
steel industry and shipping he ranks high in
practical knowledge and experience.
Last year I was in one of the smaller
comnunities in Nova Scotia. I saw men who
never before worked at naval construction
engaged in converting large private yachts into
naval craft. I have reason to believe that
their work was considered to be very satisfactory. I hope they are not forgotten; that
employment for winter months bas been
provided.
I find corroboration in an article on shipbuilding in the Ottawa Citizen of Friday last,
data for which I have no doubt was supplied
by you. In that article it is pointed out that
with comparative case thousands of competent
men have already been mobilized in Canada for
shipbuilding.
When we hear the almost daily appeals that
come out of England for ships, and more ships,

196

SENATE

and still more ships, many of us are dismayed
by the hesitancy of Canada to leap forward
with a practical and substantial shipbuilding
policy-a shipbuilding policy labelled. "Ship
Construction

in Canada at Canada's Cost for

Canada's War Services."

That, it seems to me,

would bc timely action for a nation like Canada,

that proudly and boldly stepped into the fighting
ring and hurled defiance at Germany and Italy.
Wiat is the radio news to-day fron Canada's
front line of defence, the British Isles? Three
thousand eight hundred men, women and children killed in Deceniber and 7,000 others injured
by German bombs.
And here we are in perfect safety, living on
the fat of the land. while in England those who
are not moassacred must he content with reduced
food rations. Why? Because the ships that
were carrying food-stuffs have had to be
diverted to the carrying of guns and munitions.
Yet Canada hesitates, halts, and debates about
building ships for Canada's war service.
Yours very truly,
(Signed) Chas. E. Tanner.
Now, I do not want to repeat that, honourable members. That is the position I took with
the department in January, 1941. The honourable leader on this side of the House has
mentioned a return, brought down at my
request, which shows that after the letting of
the contracts mentioned in the return, twelve
months elapsed before two ships were put into
the sailt water. The other day there came a
report from Sir Lyman Duff about the Hong
Kong expedition. It showed that we had to get
a British ship to take our men to Hong Kong,
and that 'we had to get an American ship
to carry the niechanical appliances for that
force. And that ship with the mechanical
appliances was diverted, Sir Lyman said; so
it did not reach Hong Kong. He stated:
This miscarriage was not in any way due to
any fault or mistake of any officer of the
Canadian Forces or of any official of the
Canadian Government.
Certainly not. It was wholly the fault of
the Government, not of its understrappers.
The Government had no vision at all with
regard to shipbuilding and ship supplies. It
lot montlh after month after month go by,
and here we are to-day without ships, our
ports crammed with goods. As Sir Lyman
said, that is not the fault of the officials. It
is the fault of the Government, because it
liad no vision of future requirements.
I want to say a word or two about this
wooden-ship business. In the other Chamber
honourable members tried to interest the
Government in the construction of wooden
bottoms. I took a little part in that too,
because I saw wooden ships built, I saw them
sail, I knew the commanders and the seamen on them when they sailed out of Nova
Scotian ports, and I know they sailed to
almost every port in South America, that
Hon. Mr. TANNER.

they went to the Indian Ocean, to the North
Sea, to New Zealand, to Australia, China,
the Dutch Islands-in fact, almost everywhere
-carrving
all sorts of cargoes. But no one
could interest this Department of Munitions
and Supply in wooden ships. Apparently the
head of that department said to himself:
"It is botter to be without ships, if we cannet get steel to build them, than to have
wooden ships; better to let cargoes rot than
to have wooden bottoms built to carry them
to England and other parts of the Empire."
That is the conclusion one would come to,
because nobody could interest him in wooden
ships. In the fall of 1939 and the winter
of 1940 he could have had hundreds of wooden
bottoms constructed in Nova Sceotia, New
Brunswick and Prince Edward Island and
on the Pacific coast, and they could have been
carrying valuable cargoes. But no, nothing
but steel bottoms would be satisfactory. And
he was not building steel bottoms. After we
actually embarked on the building of steel
bottoms we got two ships in twelveo months.
It may appear to be a wa.ste of time to
discuss those matters now, but I think the
people have a right to know the facts. That
is my justification for relating the facts.
The people ought to understand why this
shipbuilding business has not been carried
on vigorously and successfully, as it should
have been.
Hon. Mr. COPP. Would the bonourable
gentleman permit a question? He read an
interesting letter that he wrote, with regard
to shipbuilding, to a certain gentleman.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: Mr. Carswell.
lon. Mr. COPP: I should like to inquire
from my honourable friend if he received a
reply, and, if so, what it indicated Mr.
Carswell's reaction to be. My honourable
friend bas placed his letter on Hansard and
I think it would be well to have the reply
there too.
Hon. Mr. TANNER: I omitted to mention the reply, and I am glad my honourable
friend bas called my attention to it. In his
reply the Controller denied that he made the
statement. Later, when I was in Halifax, I
checked up the matter with the management of the Chronicle, and they assured me
that be did make the statement.
Hon. Mr. COPP: Then it is a question of
veracity between the Chronicle and Mr.
Carswell.
Hon. Mr. TANNER- Yes. Mind you, they
are not political friends of mine.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill
was read the second time.

JUNE 11, 1942
TIIRD READING

Hon. Mr. KING moved the third reading of
the Bill.
Hon. B. F. SMITH: Honourable senators, I
should like to make one or two observations
that I probably should have made on the
motion for second reading. I listened with a
great deal of interest to the explanation given
by the honourable leader of the Government
(Hon. Mr. King), and to the remarks of the
honourable leader on this side (Hon. Mr.
Ballantyne), and I cannot say that either one
of them touched the vital point in connection
with this Bill. It seems to me that the Government to-day is on a spending orgy and is to
a certain extent glorifying spending, and I
believe the people throughout this country
appreciate that fact. The procedure seems to
be: tax, borrow and spend. Now, I feel that
in this country we have not a proper system
of checking expenditures. Neither ithe leader
of the Government (Hon. Mr. King) nor the
leader on this side (Hon. Mr. Ballantyne)
made any reference to this matter, which to
me is of more importance than anything they
referred to. As honourable senators know,
taxing the peopic and spending their 'nuney
without telling them where it goes have disrupted many countries in the past. Such procedure would disrupt this country as well.
Let me say that the Government will not get
by with the glorification of spending money
and with no proper system of checking its
expenditures.
I corne of United Empire Loyalist stockof people who had a strong belief in thrift.
My mind goes back to the time when I was
a boy and listened to the school meetings that
were held in our district every year. At those
meetings there was criticism of every dollar of
expenditure.
The people wanted to know
where every last cent went. Later I attended
meetings of municipal councils, which I believe
are pretty good safeguards of economy, and I
found that they kept a very careful check
on expenditures. Still later I went to the
Provincial Legislature in New Brunswick,
where I found a public accounts committee,
which had authority to criticize every expenditure made by the Provincial Government. But
to-day the Government of Canada is spending
huge sums-I heard the honourable leader
(Hon. Mr. King) read off millions and billions
as though they did not amount to anythingand when you stop to think, honourable members, you realize that we have no adequate
check on those expenditures.
The suggestion that I had in mind to make
when I rose was this, that after this Bill is
passed-I would not attempt to obstruct it in

any way-we ask the Government to approve
the appointment of a committee by the Senate
to scrutinize the public accounts and the expenditures which are being made by reason of
the war. I believe it was the honourable
leader on this side who said the Prime
Minister had remarked to him that he regretted
the Senate did not have more to do. Well,
what I am suggesting would mean some
work for us. Such a committee might be
composed of, say, eleven members-two from
Quebec, two from Ontario and one from each
of the other provinces. I think that recommendations by a committee of that sort would
go a long way towards assisting the Auditor
General in making up his mind.
I really think that under present circumstances we have not a proper check-up of
expenditures the Government is making. The
people are getting tired of this state of affairs.
They are taxed such and such an amount, and
they are willing to pay their taxes; then the
Government asks them to lend money by
buying bonds, and they are will-ing to buy
bonds; but they know there is not that rigid
check there ought to be on expenditures.
Hon. J. A. CALDER: Honourable members, I have on previous occasions referred
to this feature of the present situation, that
the expenditures in this country and every
other country of the world are simply appalling. And an amazing thing about it is that
the public take this attitude: "Oh, well, let
the Governm.ent have what it thinks it needs."
I have ne doubt at all that our Auditor
General has full power to check the Government's expenditures, and that he does check
them. I doubt very much if anything gets
by him. If it does, lie should cease to be
Auditor General, because he is appointed to
his position, where he b independent of the
Government, for the very purpose of checking
all expenditures. But what I fear-and I
believe my fear is well grounded-is that all
sorts of expenditures are arranged for that
never should be arranged for. That is a very
different thing. About a year ago I strongly
urged the Government to set up a committee
of thoroughly able men to keep a check on
the countless obligations that are being incurred ail the time, not only when Parliament
is in session; a committee that would sit
day after day and decide, upon proper representations being made to it, whether or not
there was good, sound, valid reason for proposed expenditures.
Honourable
senators
follow me?
Hon. Mr. COPP: That is, whether contracts should bu awarded?

SENATE
Hon. Mr. CALDER: As to whether or not
the contract is necessary.
Hon. Mr. COPP: And should be awarded?
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Yes. From day to
day I hear from persons in all parts of the
country criticizing various expenditures which
in their judgment should never have been
made.
Sorne Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Whether there is any
basis for their opinion I am not in a position
to know; but I can conceive that a board of
four. five or six able men sitting in Ottawa
could from day to day decide whether proposeid expenditures are justified, before permission to make them is granted. I am merely
intimating what is in the mind of many
people, that at the present time there is a
great deal of wasteful expenditure.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: I say again, I do not
know whether that is the case, nor am I prepareil to put my finger on any expenditure of
thtt clas, but I hear members from British
Columbia, the Prairie Provinces or the Maritime Provinces grumbling about certain things
being done which are costing large sums of
noney, and which in their judgment should
never be donc at all. What I fear in connection with the present situation is this:
officials and ministers of all departments can
ask for what they like, and get it, whether it
is necessary or not. It seems to me there
should be a proper system of .control. The
Minister of Finance cannot deal with it; ho
has not the time. Neither can the Minister
of Supply; he, too, has net the time. If
there are any men in Ottawa overburdened
with work to-day, it is those two men. You
must liave a body te exercise that control.
Wlien the heads of the departments concerned
think certain expenditure is necessary, let
thern go to this board and the Minister himself and show them why it is necessary. It
would not take a month to do that. Suppose

an expenditure of $10,000,000 or $15,000,000, or
$800.000, is recommended for this, that or
the other thing: I should net think it would
take long to convince a business board that
such au expenditure is or is net ne-cessary.
I may be reminded of the Treasury Board.
That is a purely routine board. I have been
on the Treasury Board, and I say yeu cannot
depend upon it for two seconds to look after
anything of that kind properly, and you cannot expect the Minister of Finance or any
other busy Minister to do it properly. You
must have a separate board to deal with that
Hop. Mr. COPP.

control and nothing else. I would suggest
again that after a lapse of a year or two,
unless this thing is taken in hand, the day will
come when there will be a reckoning for huge
expenditures which should never have been
made. Yeu do not hear much about them in
Parliament just now, simply because there is
more or less a political truce and members
of Parliament do not wish to make trouble
for those in authority.
Hon. Mr. KING: I do not wisi to continue
the argument, but I do desire to call the
attention of my honourable friend opposite
and other honourable members te section 6
of the Bill. The section reads:
Upon the Treasury Board naking an allotnient of any part of the two billion dollars
($2,000,000,000) granted by this Act aid by
The War Appropriation Act, No. 1, 1942, to
provide for the cost of any service, the Minister
of Finance shall cause an aecounting record to
be inaintained in a form that will disclose the
financial connnitnients entered into and the
expenditure made as a consequence of the
allotrent being provided for the service
concerned.
I am net in a position to say whether the
Minister bas made that arrangement, but it
is his duty to sec that these commitments
are carefully scrutinized. I quite agree with
what my honourable friend opposite bas said.
The control he suggests is most important,
but we all know that in the varions departments an effort is being made to check carefully each and every one of these expenditures.
To-day Ottawa is full of men constantly in
conference with the various Ministers to insure
that these moneys are properly expendled.
Hon. B. F. SMITH: Honourable senators,
we are aware of the section to which the
honourable leader opposite has referred, but I
would ask him whether he does net think
that a committee specially appointed to look
after matters of this kind could deai more
satisfactorily with them thsan could a Minister
who is over-burdened with other matters.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: May I say a word in
reply ? I have already stated that in my
judgment-and I have had some experience-Hon. Mr. KING: I know you have.
Minister does
Hon. Mr. CAkLDER: -the
net begin to handle what I have spoken of;
he cannot possibly do so. So far as the
Treasury Board is concerned, I have had long
experience with treasury boards, bofth provincial and federal, and I know that to a very
large extent they are merely routine bodies.
The Treasury Board is called just on the eve
of a meeting of Council, its members have
two hundred things te deal with, and they go

JUNE 11, 1942
through them like lightning-in many cases,
if not in the majority, without consideration
or discussion. They will not and cannot
exercise control. So the provision in the Bill
in that regard is not worth a snap of the
fingers.
Hon. Mr. COPP: My honourable friend
asserts that the Minister of Finance and other
Ministers are overworked and cannot handle
this thing, and we all agree with him. But the
Bill reads, "The Minister of Finance shall cause
an accounting record to be maintained." It is
not necessarily to be donc by the Treasury
Board; it may be done by a committee or a
commission or a body of men whom he selects
to represent the Finance Department, which
assumes responsibility for these expenditures.
The Minister does not act in person. I quite
agree with my honourable friend that great
care should be taken to see, so far as possible,
that every dollar is properly spent. There
will of course be a certain amount of wastage;
nevertheless I agree that every effort should
be made to prevent it. I think this Bill
provides that such an effort shall be made.
I take it for granted, as J think we all should,
that the Minister of Finance has assumed this
responsibility and has a committee or body of
men or experts to look after the control in
the very way my honourable friend suggests.
Hon. A. L. BEAUBIEN: The House of
Commons last session appointed a committee
to investigate every war contract entered
into by the Government with individuals
and corporations. That committee sat throughout the session and during the greater part
of the recess. It was reappointed this session
and has been continuing its work. I think
it may be assumed that, that special committee having gone into war expenditures very
extensively, and having to report its findings
to the Commons, the treasury is pretty well
guarded.
Hon. B. F. SMITH: With reference to the
committee just mentioned by the honourable
senator from St. Jean Baptiste (Hon. Mr.
Beaubien), a great deal of dissatisfaction has
been expressed because the committee held its
sessions in secret and many important things
were never disclosed to it. I think my honourable friend will agree that such a committee could not effectively look after the
interests of the people of Canada with respect
ta such expenditures as are covered by this
Bill.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: One word more to
make myself clear. I am not referring to
accounting or auditing at all.

199

Hon. Mr. KING: I know.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: I am referring ta
control over expenditures that are not necessary. Let me give an illustration. It has
been represented Vo me that a large sum of
money has been provided for removing a
rock in the Seymour NarrowsHon. Mr. KING: Ripple Rock.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: A rock that has been
there thousands of years. If my information
is correct, the cost of this work is ta be somewhere in the neighbourhood of three or four
hundred thousand dollars. Did you ever hear
of such nonsense in your life? Do you mean
to say a board of sensible men would permit
an expenditure of that kind in these days?
Well, I should say not! That is the kind
,of thing I am aiming at; not the ordinary,
everyday ex-penditures of Government in
connection with the war, but the extraordinary
expenditures that are being made at this
time in large amounts. I say an effective
control should be placed upon that class of
expenditures.
The motion was agreed ta, and the Bill
was read the third time, and passed.

LOAN BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. J. H. KING moved the second reading of Bill 96, an Act to authorize the
raising, by way of loan, of certain sums of
money for the Public Service.
He said: By this Bill the Governor in
Council is authorized: to raise money (1) ta
pay or redeem the whole or any portion of
any loans or obligations of Canada; (2) ta
purchase unmatured securities of Canada;
(3) for public works; (4) for general purposes. The main purpose for which it is
intended ta use moneys ta be borrowed is
to pay off securities of Canada which mature
or are callable within the next year or two.
Moneys borrowed under the authority given
by the Bill may also be used for public
works and general purposes by the Government of Canada. It is ta be noted that the
proceeds of the sale of securities issued under
this authority have to be paid into the Consolidated Revenue Fund, and can be paid
out of that fund only under parliamentary
authority.
The amount ta be authorized is $750,000,000. The Loan Acts of 1931, 1933, 1935, 1936,
1939 and 1940 have all authorized the borrowing of 3750,000,000.
There is no particular
magic in that amount.
In fact it would

SENATE
appear to me that probably another Loan
Act will be required next year, although
two years have elapsed since the passage, of
the last Loan Act. I think honourable members are aware of the fact that a bill of this
kind comes to us at intervals of one or two
years.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill
was read the second time.

POOLING OF BRITISH AND AMERICAN
PRODUCTION
INQUIRY

On the Orders of the Day:
Hon. A. D. McRAE: Honourable senators,
I rise te ask the honourable leader of the
Hous (Hon. Mr. King) whether he can give
us any information on a subject that is of
deep concern to me and, I am sure, te many
Canadian producers. I have reference to an
article which appeared in the Press a few
days ago to the effect that Great Britain and
the United States have pooled their resources,
particularly production, and that the pool is
to be administered by an American and a
British representative. The American representative is to have charge of all of North
America, which includes Canada. We in this
Dominion produce many commodities which
are more or less in competition with those of
the United States, and while I have the highest regard and warmest friendship for our
neighbours to the south, I do net know that
either I or the producers of Canada would feel
content te leave the administration of that
pool, so far as our interests are concerned,
entirely in the hands of our American friends.
We have, as honourable senators are aware,
occupied a favourable position in the British
market for many years. Both before the war
and since, we have had the benefit of very
full co-operation by the British authorities,
especially in the marketing of our agricultural
products, and I have been wondering whether
this pooling arrangement is likely to interfere
with that co-operation. Will the honourable
leader of the House tell us whether this Press

JUNE 12, 1942
report is correct? If he is not able at the
moment to reply to the inquiry, I would
request that he get an explanation of the arrangement and give it to us at the first opportunity after we reconvene.
Hon. Mr. KING: I should not care to make
any statement at the present time, but I will
bring the honourable gentleman's remarks to
the attention of -the Government and will try
to supply the information for which he has
asked.

EMERGENCY SITTINGS OF THE
SENATE
Hon. J. H. KING: Honourable senators,
before we adjourn to-day I should like to call
attention to the resolution which we adopted
on January 27 of this year, providing that
in the event of an emergency arising during
any adjournment of the Senate the honourable the Speaker may notify senators, at
their addresses as registered with the Clerk,
to meet at a time earlier than that set out in
the motion for such adjournment. I do this
so there may be no misunderstanding as to
the motion which I am about to move for a
somewhat long adjournment. It is quite
possible that before the end of the proposed
adjournment the Senate may have to reconvene to deal with the Bill to amend the
Mobilization Act, which is now under discussion in the other House. Subject to this
reservation, I move that when the Senate
adjourns to-day it do stand adjourned until
the 14th of July next, at 8 o'clock in the
evening.
The motion was agreed to.
The Senate adjourned during pleasure.

DISCUSSION

Hon. W. E. FOSTER rose in accordance
with the following notice:
That he will call the attention of the Senate
to some features of the report of the auditors
of the accounts of the Canadian National Railway Systen to Parlianent, together witii the
report of the directors for the year 1941.
He said:
Honourable members of the
Senate, pursuant to the notice which appears
on the Order Paper, I wish to direct the
attention of the Senate to certain features of
the report of the auditors of the accounts of
the Canadian National Railway System. I
realize the difficulty of interesting members
of the House in any topie other than that
whiclh is tippe rmost in the minds of us all at
this time; nevertheless, I shall endeavour as
far as possible to fulfil my duty and to evoke
some interest in this report, which in reality
is a very interesting one and concerns the
people of Canada generally.
I have the report in question under my
hand. While it contains a great many figures
and inucli detail, all of which is set forth very
clearly, i tlink wo must bear in mind that the
transactions of this great undertaking are
very large and very nmierous, and tîat in
addition to the report of the auditors, as
tabli in the House, there is an internal audit
conducted Py a department of the railway
sys tem itself.
One can approacli the report which bas
been presented to Parliament with the idea
that it is a very satisfactory one as compared with sone of those presented in previous years. Certainly it brings some degree
of cheer to the taxpayers who own this great
undertaking. The predictions of those who
were of the opinion that financial difficulty
faced the country by reason of accumulating
deficits still ccho from the walls of this
Chanber, but I think I am safe in saying that
if this property never earned another surplus
dollar it has justified its existence, because
without it Canada could net have effectively
perforied ier
part in the great conflict in
which we are now engaged.
lion. Mr. TANNER.

In looking over these reports, which are
very extensive and contain a great mass of
figures, one naturally finds some striking
features. I find, for instance, that tied in
with this system there are some ninety-six
subsidiary companies, and that the revenues
of sixty-six of them are embodied in the
accounts of the Canadian National Railways.
One cannot but be impressed with the magnitude of this, the people's property, and the
responsibility of those charged with the administration of its affairs.
Before dealing with the figures in the report
itself, I should like to review very briefly
something of the history of this great undertaking. Honourable members of the Senate
will remember very well that some few years
ago, because of the decrease in traffic, deficits
on the Canadian National Railways were
becoming alarming. This situation was due
in part to the establishment of other means of
transportation, such as the air lines and the
motor transport system over an almost perfect
network of highways provided by the various
provinces. Revenues were dropping rapidly.
As a result of this situation sorne of the members of this House conceived the idea of
investigating in order to see if in some way
it were net possible to reduce operating
expenditures and thereby lessen deficits. A
committee of the Senate was appointed, and
made a very extensive and exhaustive inquiry
into all the ramifications of the Canadian
National and the Canadian Pacific railways,
and there emanated from that committee a
report which was the basis of certain legislatien known as the Canadian National-Canadian Pacifie Bill. The main features of that
Bill were, first, the provision made for greater
co-operation between the managements of
our two great railway systems in order to
bring about a reduction in operating expenses,
and second, the elimination of certain duplicating lines which miglît be abandoned without affecting the efficiency of either road. It
was thouglht that some economies could be
effected bv the elimination of these lines;
that traffic should move over the shortest
route, irrespective of whether it originated
on one road or on the other.
So little heed was paid to the directions
issued to the railways after this extensive
investigation, that I always thought the heads
of the two roads should be brought before
the House to explain why greater efforts had
net been made to carry out the provisions
embodied in the legislation; but perhaps, in
view of the changed conditions brought about
by the war, it was just as well that the
eliminations provided for in the legislation
were net effected.

JULY 14, 1942
During the course of the investigation the
railway men themselves advanced certain suggestions. To one of them I am going to refer,
because it concerns the province from which
I come. One man, who was supposed to be
an expert in railway matters, suggested at that
time that the part of the Transcontinental
Railway which extends from Diamond Junetion, in the province of Quebec, -to the city
of Moncton, in the province of New Brunswick, should be abandoned, and that the
Canadian National railway via Campbellton
and the Canadian Pacifie line across Maine
could look after the traffic so far as the
Maritime Provinces were concerned. As to the
line from Diamond Junction to Moncton,
which was criticized so severely in this House,
I may say that if it never earns another dollar
it bas justified its existence during the war
period, because the increased volume of
traffic originating in war industries in Upper
Canada could not have been moved over the
other two roads to the eastern ports.
It is my intention, honourable senators,
not to discuss the question of the national
importance of our railways, but rather to
point out in my own way some features of
the auditors' and directors' reports as contained in the two documents laid on the Table
of this House. These reports, meagre as they
are in many respects, form the basis of my
statement. With little effort one can bring
out information of a pleasing character. On
the other hand, one might find some fault in
connection with certain matters. It is not
my intention to throw bricks at anybody;
neither do I wish to lavish undue praise. My
purpose is to point out what I find, and to
present a little information which I have
gleaned from the mass of figures contained
in the report presented this year.
The first item that strikes one on reading
the report is the statement of liabilities and
assets. One finds that the liabilities of the
Canadian National Railways at this time reach

the tidy sum of approximately $1,500,000,000.

This is a substantial figure, though it does not
bulk large when compared with the items we
read about in these stirring times. These liabilities are made up as follows: there is a
long-term debt outstanding which amounts to
$1,134,000,000, there are loans from the Government of Canada amounting to $195,343,000,
and there is a sum of about $17,000,000 apparently loaned by the Government to the
Canadian National Railways for working capital. In addition there are certain current
liabilities amounting to $43,000,000-a sum
which does not seem very great in view of
the large financial transactions of the railway
-and there are deferred liabilities of about
$8,000,000, and items of unadjusted balances

due te other railways amounting te about
$45,000,000.
These sums bring the gross
liability of the Canadian National Railways to
$1,500,000,000 in round figures. In passing I
may say that last year the liability was increased only to a very slight degree, this fact
being due, of course, to the revenue derived
from the transportation of war materials
during the year 1941.
Having dealt with the liability of $1,500,000,000, we naturally turn to the asset side of the
account. Here we find that the assets of the
Canadian National Railways amount to
approximately $2,100,000,000, the difference
between the two accounts being about $660,000,000, known as the proprietor's equity.
The total of the assets is made up mainly
from the valuation placed on the railway system's properties. We all know that in financial
transactions one can always ascertain what is
owing by any company with which one may
be connected, but that it is not easy to ascertain the value of the assets. However, as I
say, the assets are put down here at $2,112,000,000, and are made up principally of properties
which are valued at $1,944,000,000. There are
other assets, of course. For instance, there is
a sinking fund of $711,000, which is not a very
large sum of money when we consider the
liabilities and the securities that are issued
against the property. How the value of the
assets is arrived at, the report does not disclose, but I presume it is on a cost basis, with
certain depreciation.
That completes the matter of assets and
liabilities.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: Would the
honourable senatorHon. Mr. FOSTER: This question will be
open for discussion later, and I should like my
honourable friend to wait until I am through.
I should prefer to continue without interruption, se as not to break the continuity of my
remarks.
The next matter of interest in a statement
of this kind, after you have dealt with the
assets and liabilities, is the matter of income
and outgo. When we look at this report we
find it enumerates the various sources from
which income was received. It shows that
operating income for the year 1941 amounted
to some $304,000,000. That is an increase of
$56,000,000 over the year 1940. The operating
expenses increased by $35,000,000. The railway, by reason of its operation, was able to
pay all its outstanding fixed charges; that is
to say, the interest on the debt held by the
public, and interest on Government loans,
and all expenses in connection with operation;
and after all these were paid there was left
over a cash surplus of some $4,000,000, in
comparison with a deficit of some $16,000,000

206

SENATE

the year before. That is, the showing is better
by something more than $20,000,000 than that
for the year 1940.
In considering that, I think it is well to
bear in mind that this $4,000,000 of surplus
might have been largely increased if certain
additional write-offs had not been allowed for.
I find that. besides making this cash surplus
of 84,000,000, the company paid in the year
1941 wage increases amounting to $6,000,000,
brougit about by the war-time cost-of-living
bonus which the law made applicable to
railways. In addition there was an increase of
wages on the United States line by reason of
legislation passed at Washington for increasing
wages of United States railway employees.
This amounted to $800,000.
Then, perhaps because during the lean years
sufficient money had net been spent on
maintenance, there was an additional expendituro of $6,000,000 on the trackage of some
23.000 miles, or an average of about $250 per
mile over the whole system. This was made
necessary net only for the reason I have
stated, but also, no doubt, because of the
heavier equipment now used on the lines and
the heavier trains being hauled over them.
The report also shows that last year an
additional amount of $2,000,000 was provided
for depreciation of equipment. I think this
was a very good provision to make, considering the railway's earnings at the time.
The next item to which I should like to
refer briefly is the amount expended by the
railway last year on capital account. That is
a very important matter. Crities of the road
say sonetimes that too much is being charged
to capital account. The capital expenditures
for last year were only $13,700,000, and of this
amount $6,700,000 was for the purchase of
equipment. .Honourable members will no
doubt have read in the Press lately that our
railway shops are turning out locomotives of
the 6200 class, which are the heaviest locomotives used on the American continent.
They will haul about 100 loaded cars over
existing grades without much reduction in
speed, thanks to the ingenuity of man in
being able to transmit additional power to the
driving wheels. I think it is a matter for
pride that in this country we are able to
manufacture and place on the rails of the
Canadian National Railways the most powerful type of locomotive in use on this
continent.
In addition, locomotive shops were built
at Moncton, costing $540,000, and yard extensions at Moncton cost $313,000. I mention
these items particularly for the benefit of my
honourable friend opposite who comes from
the city of Moncton (Hon. Mr. Léger), who
Hon. Mr. FOSTER.

no doubt has from time to time heard
criticism that the Government does not spend
much money down there.
Tien there was an expenditure of $1,381,000
on what the report refers to as centralized
Honourable members will
traffic control.
recall that at the last session the honourable
gentleman from Westmorland (Hon. Mr.
Black) disoussed the proposed installation of
this centralized control. I do not say that
he did this in a critical manner at all. He
had been informed. I suppose, that the installation would cost more than a million dollars
and that a great deal of the equipment would
have to be imported from the United States.
A system of centralized control was installed
on the Atlantic division of the Canadian
National Railways, between Moncton and
T may say that there has been

some criticism of this, but it must be realized
that at the junction where that electrical
control operates three railway lines converge
-the line from Saint John te Moncton, the
Transcontinental railway line from Diamond
Junction to Moncton, the Intercolonial railway fron Montreal via Campbellton; and in
addition there is the traffic to and from
Prince Edward Island.
The traffic over the line from Moncton to
Halifax is very heavy. On making inquiry
I was informed that if this electrie control
had net been installed it would have been
necessary to double-track the whole line from
Moncton to Halifax in order to carry the
traffic that is passing over the single tracks
at the present time. So far as I know, this
is the only ccntralized traffic control of its
kind in use in Canada, and I think it is
safe to say that the expenditure on it is
justified by the existing situation there. I
am told by railway men that the control is
working very well under normal conditions,
although in the winter there is a little bit of
bother from ice; but, all in all, it is felt that
the installation was justified. In my opinion
the railway management deserves a great
deal of credit for installing such up-to-date
apparatus for the movement of trains. Just
here I might refer to a little personal
experience I had two years ago when travelling froin Moncton te Halifax with a member
of my family. I was going on what was to me
a very important mission. Three trains tried
to pass on the same track, with the result
that the train I was on tried to pass the
others via the ditch. I will say nothing
more than that I am thankful to be here to
tell the tale.
One other item in these capital expenditures,
to which I should like to refer-it is one that
has been a matter of considerable criticism

JULY 14, 1942
in the country-is the Montreal Terminals
development. I see that some $3,000,000 was
spent on this in 1941. I am informed that
$1,900,000 will be spent this year to complete
that project. The total expenditure to the
end of 1941 was approximately $25,000,000,
and I do not think this can be regarded as
unjustified when one considers the conditions
existing at Bonaventure station. Those of
us who travel by that road know the facilities there are very much out of date and
something had to be done. I am not an
expert and do not know whether a joint
terminal would have been better, but I do
know that the terminals when completed
will be a credit to the railway and to the
country, and that they will provide very
much better accommodation for all the
people who travel in and out of Montreal
via the Canadian National. After ail, with
the cost of money what it is to-day, the
annual interest on the capital investment
for providing these facilities is a matter of
only $750,000.
Last year the increased freight and passenger
traffic necessitated the employment of 6,700
more men, but notwithstanding the additional
expenditure in wages the increase in net earnings was very satisfactory.
The annual report informs us that in 1941
the management applied to the Board of Transport Commissioners for the abandonment of
certain branch lines. Of these applications the
Board approved three and rejected eight. In
my humble judgment, honourable members,
under present conditions it is not good policy
to abandon branch lines, whether owned and
operated by the National System or by the
Canadian Pacifie. In this connection I wish
to deal particularly with a short branch line
referred to in my inquiry, which was answered
earlier this evening. This line runs through
two counties-the county in which I had a considerable interest in my active political days,
and where I was born, and the county represented by my son in the Legislature of New
Brunswick before he left Canada, which constituency I have to look after while he is
away. I find two applications were made for
abandonment of this road. The first was
refused because of the strong protest raised
by some of us. Later a second application was
made, but apparently those affected were somewhat tired of protesting and offered no opposition. Thereupon an order was issued for the
abandonment of the road. Workmen appeared
on the scene, tore up the rails and took away
everything loose. They left only the old ties
along the right of way, and these are an eyesore to the local people and a remembrance
of better transportation days. Now, with the

207

war-time scarcity of rubber and gasoline, the
people are hamstrung in regard to transportation. It is all very well for those who draw
monthly salaries to be disinterested in this
matter, but the people in the country formerly
served by the abandoned railway depended on
that transportation for the weekly sale of their
pulpwood and farm products, and now they
are very seriously inconvenienced. I repeat,
I do not think that under existing conditions
there should be any further abandonment of
railway lines.
I desire now to refer to some of the
auxiliary services. Last year the Canadian
National Railway System derived from its
express service a revenue of $11,400,000, against
an expenditure of $5,800,000, leaving a profit
of $5,600,000. Its commercial telegraphs produced a revenue of $5,150,000, as against an
expenditure of $4,000,000, or a profit of
$1,150,000. The dining-car service, on the contrary, was operated at a loss of $350,000, the
receipts being $2,150,000 as against expenses
of $2,500,000. I had expected that the deficit
would be considerably larger. The hotels
were operated at a profit of $600,000, which is
about 90,000 odd dollars more than the profit
for the preceding year. I do not suppose that
interest on capital investment is taken into
account; nevertheless I think the result is
satisfactory, and I believe the investment in
these hotels is well justified both from the
national and the railway point of view. Those
of us who have the privilege of staying at
the Chateau Laurier appreciate its home-like
atmosphere and courteous service. True, the
Canadian Pacific Railway was the pioneer
in this auxiliary service, and its hotels enjoy
an enviable reputation for efficient management and friendly service. It is greatly to
the credit of the Canadian National System
that the very high standard set by those in
charge of the hotel system has won for its
hotels an excellent reputation for efficient
management and courteous service.
The report states that Mr. Hungerford has
resigned his position as president, but will
continue as chairman of the board of directors.
I think the National Railways are fortunate in
being able to retain his services in this
capacity. I know Mr. Hungerford personally,
and I am sure that other members who have
had occasion to visit him on business will agree
with me that he has a charming personality
and was always very courteous in his contacts with us. His gentlemanly, unassuming
attitude inspired confidence in those who had
the pleasure of meeting him, and I repeat, the
Canadian National Railway System is fortunate in being able to retain him as chairman. He was president during the period of
falling revenues, when he had to meet a very

208

SE-NATE
SENATE

208

difficult situation, but he handled it successfully and administered the systen carefully
and thoroughly. Mr. P. C. Vaughan has
succeeded him as president. I understand that
Mr. Vaughan has had considerable experience
in railroading, but I think it would be better
not to judge hin by this very admirable
report; rather we should wait until the return
of more or less normal conditions. For
undoubtedly war conditions have greatly
stimulated both freight and passenger traffic,
and this stimulus is what I may term artificial.
There is, however, nothing artificial about the
very satisfactory performance of the systemt
during the past year. The Canadian National
Railway System has stood the test of war.
Will it stand the test of peace? I do not think
anyone would venture to forecast the operating results of the systen after war activities
cease. But one thing is certain: the people
of Canada will be in no mood to provide for
large deficits in the complacent and willing
way in which they treated demands for
assistance in the past. They will want more
detailed information of the financial operatiens of this great company. The people will
demand, if I know their temper, greater efforts
at co-operation between both transportation
systems, more particularly in the elimination
of long hauls on a fair and reciprocal basis.
In closing, honourable members, I have three
suggestions to make. Members of a committee
of this House which a few years ago investigated the operation of this great property are
familiar with its ramifications. I do not know
whether my suggestion is practicail. but I would
urge that the conmittee which in another
place examines each year the accounts and
activities of the Canadian National Railway
System mtight very well be enlarged to include members of the Senate; in other words,
that it be made a joint committee of the
two Houses.
Some Hon. SENATORS:

Hear. hear.

Hon. Mr. FOSTER: One bates to mention
local conditions. but since the outbreak of
the war there have ieen c tallished in the
city front which I cone two fleets of pick-up
motor trucks, one bv tie Canadian National
Railways, the other by the Canadian Pacific.
Although we have bren eut down to a twogallon gasoline unit, and as a consequence
those of us who live ont in the country have
to join with our friends to economize in gas
by using one anothers cars in alternate weeks
to get to our duties in tie city, we find these
great pick-up trucks chasing one another
around the streets of Saint John in their
efforts to pick up freighît. Now, my second
suggestion is that the Oil Controller miglt
Hon. Mr. FOSTER

well look into the question of greater ceoperation between the two railways in this
respect, so as te conserve consumption of gas
and wear and tear of tires. And it is probable
that action of this kind might very well be
taken at other points in Canada where similar
conditions exist.
My third suggestion is that there should be
no further abandonment of railway lines during
the continuance of the war, unless it can be
shown that very special conditions indicate
that such abandonment is advisable.
To sum up, the report is, I think, a very
satisfactory one, and such as to bring some
degree of cheer to the taxpayers. They are
the owners of this great system, which comprises 23,560 miles of track, employs approximately 100,000 persons in its operation, and
pays 8237,000,000 per annum for wages and
supplies. To employees who have retired on
pension it pays the goodly sum of $4,700,000
per annum, and this year it will pay into the
Unemployment Insurance Fund $1,000,000.
Surely the Canadian National Railways, which
are the Canadian people's greatest business
enterprise, have at this particular time fully
justified their existence.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: Would the honourable senator be good enough to explain the
change made in the balance sheet some years
ago when $900,000,000 were written off?
Hon. Mr. FOSTER: As I understand the
honourable gentleman, I presume ho refers to
the debt due to the Government. I have net
that information. I have not gone outside the
report, and in it there is no reference to a
write-off in years gone by.
Hon. CREELMAN MacARTHUR: Honourable senators, I am sure we were all very
much impressed by the constructive and informative address of the honourable senator
front Saint John (Hon. Mr. Foster) and by
the criticisn lie made. I should have thought,
however, thiat as a member frein the Maritimes he would give special consideration to
New Brunswick. Nova Scotia and Prince
Edward Island. He took in too much territory: he covered all the ramifications of the
railway situation.
In the Maritimes we have a serious problen, of which lie is cognizant, and though he
knows how important it is, especially to Prince
Edward Island, he bas net referred to it. Prince
Edward Island must be treated as a member
of the Confederation or must go out. I think
the honourable member fron Saint John
should have dealt with our transportation
conditions and made sone observations on
wxhat we can do to imtprove them. We do

JULY 14, 1942
not know whether the necessary steps are
being taken. Prince Edward Island is getting
no consideration wbatever in this respect.
Something must bc donc about transportation to Prince Edward Island. It bas been

than baîf that amount, and would be more
In these days 350,000,000 or

$60,000,000 is a very small amount of money,
and if expended on a cau.seway it would give
us perfect transportation, and iA would be
only ten or twelve minutes from one province
to another.
I intend writing to Captain Maguire, of the

car ferry. ta get the details of what happened
recently in the St. Lawrence. According to the
statement of Mr. Roy, the member for Gaspé
in the House of Commons, three of the vessels
in a convoy were lost. As the matter bas
been mentioned in the House of Commons
and in the Press, 1 can refer to it now. Berlin
claimed that ail but one of the vessaIs in the
convoy wcre sunk. People wbo are afraid to
cross to Prince Edward Island by boat are
taking the plane. We want to find out wbetbcr
submarines can operate there or not. We
cannot get any information.
As I have said, the bonourable member
from Saint John goes over ail the ramifications of the railway business tbroughout Canada, and in (loilLg so takes in too much
territory. What he says is very instructive
and very informative, but 1 should have liked
him to pay more attention to the Maritimes.
Hon. Mr. McRAE: Honourable senators,
I risc to a point of order.
Hon. Mr. MacARTHUR: I would ask the
honourable gentleman to refer to the Maritimes.
Hon. Mr. McRAE: I tbink the honourable
gentleman is out of order.
Hon. LOUIS COTE: Honourable senators,
I arn sure that we all feel grateful to the
honourable senator fromn Saint John (Hon. Mr.
Foster) for having raised this question to-night,
and for having discusscd it so ably and given
the bouse the constructive information which
be bas placed before us. Speaking personally,
when the honourable member graced the

others, the task of winning the war, but in
doing this we should flot overlook other
problems, problems of vast magnitude, such
as that of our national railway system. Personally I arn very glad that the honourable
member bas at this time made the comments
to which* we have listened on the statement
of the auditors of the Canadian National
Railways as presented to this House.
The picture which the honourable senator
paints of the progress made during the year
il a rosy one, and no doubt we have reason
to be pleaf3ed and gratified at the resuits.
We have lived through many years of tragic
deficits, deficits wbich accumulated year after
year and were becoming a burden which the
country was almost unable to bear. Although
the improvement in the position of our
national railways il due to the tragedy of the
war, it is gratifying to hear that they are
now carrying themselves, at least so far as
operating is concerned. But, as was hinted
by the honourable leader on this side in the
question which. he asked a few moments ago,
we must not forget that some years ago, by
the elimination from the balance sheet of
the railway's $800,000,000 or $900,000,000 of
liabilities, we made possible the presentation
of such heartening statements as the one to
which we have listened to-night.
I was particularly plcased- witb the remarksof the bonourable member from Saint John
in which he pointed out that at the end of the
war, when the present colossal dcmand on the
trans.portation facilities of this country, now
lessening the necessity of co-operation- between
the railways. will have ceased, the people of
this country will Dlot look upon deficits witb a
kindly eye, but will scrutinize the accounts and
will want to know the reason for t'hemn. It is
my hope that the railways will flot allow their
enthusiasm. to run away with them, and will
flot take these few years of artificial prosperity
as a guide for the future, but will refrain
from entering into some vast scheme of capital
expenditure. the carrying charges on which
would add to future deficits.

much interested in the eight or nine hundred
million dollars written off. That is all water
over the dam. Still we may feel in these days
of tremendous war expenditure that we got
consideration for it. But what I am interested
in is what we are going to do with our railways in the post-war period. I think we all
realize that they have been the victims, so far
as local traffic is concerned, of motor transport, the truck and the lorry. These captured
pretty nearly all the local business, which
formerly had been very profitable to the
railways. In the future there will be further
competition from another type of carrier,
which is developing rapidly these days-the

otherwise. After peace is restored, one opportunity for employment will be the need for
revamping our railways, bringing them up to
date, putting into effect the necessary economies, and so on, and there will never be a
time when that kind of work will be more
necessary than in the post-war period, or could
be done better.
This is not a pleasant outlook for the
future of our railways. In these remarks I
am expressing only my own opinion. In my
view, the responsibility for heavy transportation will never again be a remunerative one
for shareholders. It will be a responsibility
of the Government, just as our Post Office
Department is. Having said this, I do not
want anyone to feel in any way discouraged
or worried about the situation. On the contrary, we all should be prepared to meet it
as it develops in the post-war period.
I thank the honourable gentleman from

up this question.

I do not wish ta raise any contentiaus

They will have to centralize their whole transportation systemn over there, under the control
of the State, in some way or ather. They are
aiming at that in Great Britain at the present
time. It was clearly demonstrated before our
committees that there is a great deal of
duplication in our railway services and that
vast sums of money could be saved if by some
means the two systems could be brought
together. I arn not saying the Goverument

am not in favour of any particular scheme as

REINSTATEMENT IN CIVIL EMPLOYMENT BILL
SECOND R EADING

Hon. J. H. KING moved the second reading of Bill 5, an Act to provide for the
reinstatement in civil employment of discharged members of His Majesty's Forces
or other designated classes of persons.
He said: Honourable senators, this Bill
speaks for itself. It is intended that men
and women who have served in the armed
forces, the merchant marine, or the fire fighting forces shall be included in the Bill. I
may say that an Order in Council was passed
which pretty well covers the same subjectmatter. After an inquiry made by the leader
of the Opposition last year, an undertaking
was given to supplement the Order in Council
by legislation, and this Bill is the result.
It is similar to logislation now in effect in
Great Britain. the United States, Australia
and New Zealand. It was submitted to and
consideiredl favourably by the major labour
organizations in Canada, an employers' association and the Canadian Legion, and was also
given cireful study by a special committee
of the other House.
I do not think it is necessary for me to make
any further remarks. I had it in mind that
the Bill should go to Committee of the Whole;
but as a question bas been raised by the Law
Clerk in regard to the last section, which sets
no limitation to the penalties that the Governor in Council may impose for violations of
orders and regulations, I should like to have
the privilege of consulting the Minister.
Therefore, if the House agrees, I would move
that the Bill be now given second reading,
after which I shall move that it be referred to
the Standing Committee on Banking and Commerce, in order that any desirable amendments
may be made expeditiously.
Hon. C. C. BALLANTYNE: I should like to
direct the attention of the leader of the
Government to clause (b) of the Bill, which
reads:
"employer" in relation to any person accepted
for service in His Majesty's forces, means a
person carrying on any undertaking or service
in which the person accepted for service had
been employed for at least three months immediately prior to the date on which he was
accepted for service.
I have in mind the many thousands of employees who have been taken on by munitions
plants, and who will not be retained in that
employment after the war is over. According
to this Bill a man who has been employed for
three months in a munitions plant, and who
then joins the service, has the right to go back
Hon. Mr. SAUVE.

to his employer and ask to be reinstated in his
former position at the salary he was earning
when he enlisted. We all know that after the
war is over these munitions plants will be discharging thousands of employees, and I should
like to inquire how this clause can operate.
Hon. Ir. KING: I think section 4 of the
Bill covers that situation, in part at least.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: Section 4 provides that it shall be a defence for the
employer to prove:
(a) that the person fornerly employed by
him did not, within three months after discharge iii Canada from the service or from
hospital treatment following discharge
in
Canada, or within four months after discharge
overseas or froin hospital treatment following
discharge overseas, apply to the employer for
reimstatement-

Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Look at paragraph (c) of section 4. I think that covers
the point raised.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: Paragraphs (c)
and (d) say it shall be a defence for the
employer to prove:
(c) that, by reason of a change of circuistances, other than the engagement of some
other person to replace him, it xwas not reasonably practicable to reinstate hii or that his
reinstatemient in an occupation and under condii tiens not less favourable to hun than those
which would have beenî applicable te him had
he not been accepted for service wxith the armied
forces was iipracticable, and that the employer
has offered te reinstate him in the imost favourable occupation and under the most favourable
conditions reasonably practicable; or
(d) that hie was physically or imentally incapable of performinig xwork available in the
emrployer's service.
It is a different matter if the employee is
not physically or mentally fit. In such circumstances he could not ask for employment.
I cannot see that that changes my argument.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Section 9 provides
for a showdown where necessary to determine
whether the employer or employee is right.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: In that showdown the man who is seeking to be reinstated
will incur no expense. All the onus and all
the expense are on the employer of labour.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: That is right.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: And the deci-ion night be ag
aint the cm over, requiring him to reinstate a man when he is laying
off employees by the hundred.
Hon. Mr. COPP: If an employer has gone
out of business he cannot reinstate his former
employees.
Hon. Mr. COTE: I have not read this Bill,
but after listening to the honourable leader's

213

JULY 15, 1942
explanation I am in doubt as to whether the
intention is that the Bill should continue in
force after the declaration of peace, at the
end of the war. If that is the intention, how
can this Parliament legislate to govern the
relation of employer and employee, which is
purely a matter of contract, and, it strikes
me, a matter wholly within the jurisdiction of
the provinces?
Hon. Mr. KING: I should think it is
intended to apply after the war.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: Surely.
Hon. Mr. KING: As men return from
service, now or after the war is over, and seek
employment with their former employers, it
will be obligatory on those employers to find
positions for them, unless there is some good
reason why this cannot be done. And the
employer in each such case will have to show
good reason.
Hon. Mr. COTE: If that is so, will the
honourable leader bring my remarks to the
attention of our Law Clerk, in order that when
the Bill comes before the Banking and Commerce Committee he may enlighten us on this
point of law, which to my mind is rather
important?
Hon. Mr. KING: It would be well to have
the Bill sent to the committee.
Hon. C. P. BEAUBIEN: Honourable senators, it seems to me that in a great many
cases this Bill would be absolutely impractical.
I know of companies that had four thousand
employees before the war and have more
than twenty-five thousand now. What can
you expect these employers to do? It seems
to me quite evident that if you place on them
the obligation imposed by this Bill they will
be absolutely incapable of meeting it. The
employees in such cases are really the charges,
not of the employers, but of the Government.
If this Bill goes to committee we should perhaps have the Minister or someone else
present to answer this question. It is a very
disturbing one for employers who are operating without any profit. Do not forget that
in a great many cases employers are carrying
on for the purpose of helping their country
and are making virtually no profit at all.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: I am not on the
Banking and Commerce Committee. I agree
largely with what has been said by the honourable senator from Montarville (Hon. Mr.
Beaubien), and I think the question he has
raised makes it necessary that the Banking
and Commerce Committee should consider
paragraph (b) of section 2 and define the
term "employer" more clearly and definitely.

Many employers who at present have large
staffs were not in business before the war,
and will not have any business after peace is
declared.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. LEGER: Honourable senators,
what bothers me at the present time is the
question whether Parliament bas jurisdiction
to pass such legislation. It is certainly a
matter of civil rights, and that is within the
jurisdiction of the provinces.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill
was read the second time.
REFERRED TO COMMITTEE

On motion of Hon. Mr. King, the Bill was
referred to the Committee on Banking and
Commerce.
WAR RISK INSURANCE BILL
MOTION FOR SECOND READING

Hon. J. H. KING moved the second reading of Bill 56, an Act to make provision with
respect to insurance of property against war
risks and the payment of compensation for
war damage.
Hon. Mr. McRAE: Honourable senators,
I would ask the honourable leader whether
it is his intention to move that this Bill be
referred to the- Banking and Commerce
Committee.
Hon. Mr. KING: Yes. I will make only a
brief explanation of this Bill. I found it very
intricate and difficult to understand, although
I gave it careful study and also read the
debate in another place. I may say it was
only after December 7, 1941, after Pearl Harbour, that it seemed necessary to the Minister to have legislation of this character in
Canada. At that time he made a public
announcement that a bill would be introduced
to provide for war risk insurance and the
payment of compensation to persons whose
property suffered war damages. Since then
careful study bas been made of conditions
in Canada. A prominent and capable man,
I understand, visited the Atlantic and Pacifie
coasts and examined into the situation there;
and the situation in the interior was also
fully considered.
The Minister has utilized information in
the possession of the insurance companies,
and through departmental committees he has
endeavoured to determine what form of insurance would best cover war risks. He has
familiarized himself with the British scheme
of insurance as applied in the last war and
in this war, as well as with the scheme that

SENATE
has been set up in the United States. It was
not until the whole subject had been thoroughly studied by the Minister and a number
of experts that this Bill was introduced in
another place, where certain amendments
were made before it was sent over to us.
It will be noted that the Bill provides for
two things: first, compensation payable for
damages incurred before the Bill comes into
force, and, secondly, war risk insurance. It
is the purpose of the Minister to spread the
cost of this insurance over the whole of
Canada, so that it will be equally borne.
That is, places more vuilnerable than others
to damage or risk will not be penalized on
account of their location.
Some confusion has arisen regarding insurance for the smaller fishing craft that
operate off the Atlantic and the Pacific coasts.
These boats, though not of great money
value to the owners or their associates, are
essential to them as a means of earning
their livelihood.
In ordinary times such
boats are usually not insurable.
In any
event, it is commonly the case that the
fishermen do net earn enough to enable
them to pay for adequate insurance. The
Government is taking care of that class of
boat, net in this Bill, but by Order in
Council.
I ar stating this now in order
that we may be clear on the point. It was
thought better to provide separately for
insurance on such small craft. and the intention is that the minimum risk acceptable
shall be $300 and the maximum $2,000. Similar protection will be available for the nets,
the minimum being $25 and the maximum
$300.
Our Law Clerk has suggested several
amendments. I am informed from the Minister's office that an official will attend before
our committee to-morrow in order that we
may get a clear perspective of this Bill.
Hon. A. D. McRAE: Honourable senators,
it is not clear to me whether the provision
with respect to fishing vessels would apply to
our seiners or the more valuable craft. The
limitation is in fact of little importance to
the fishing interests of the Pacifie coast,
where our boats run into values ranging
from $40,000 to $50.000. Other major issues
affect us on the Pacifie coast, and they can
be diseussed in committee. I would suggest
to the honourable leader of the House that
the expert on whom the Government has
been depending for the preparation of this
Bill siutild attend our comittee to-morrow,
in addition to our Superintendent of Insurance and any other departmental officials
who have any information to offer on the

subject. I think it important that we should
have a pretty thorotigh discussion of this
Bill, because I have fouînd in my recent trip
west that many people are somewhat in the
dark as to whiat is intended to be done by
this proposed legislation.
Hon. WILLIAM DUFF: Honourable senators, I am sure we all appreciate the
honouraible leader's explanation of this Bill.
Last night I presumed that the proper time
to explain a bill was on its first reading, and
I have to apologize for my lack of knowledge
of the procedure of this Chamber.
As honourable members are aware, on a
motion for second reading of a bill we discuss its principle; that is, what it means and
what will happen upon its enactment. As I
remarked yesterday, after arriving in the city
I endeavoured to give a little thought to
this Bill. To that end I read it over at least
threce times, but, as I said then, I was still
at sea regarding the purpose of the measure.
Althiough the prospect is a little less eloudy
to-day, I am still in a dense fog and, as
you will notice, my siren is still blowing.
It seems to me that legislation of this kind
îs dangerous. The Bill is entitled "The War
Risk Insurance
oct."
We have been told
by the ionourable leader of the Covernment
that one of the reasons for its introduction
was that insuîrance could not he had with the
regular line fire or marine insurance coinpanies, and that some boats are of such low
value thiat it would be impossible to insure
them in the ordinary way. I regret to say
that I cannot agree with this contention. In
miay experience, which I admit is not very
extensive, I have found no diffieulty in
getting war risk insurance. covered by marine
underwriters. Just tiis morning I put $24,000
war risk insurance on goods aboard a fishing
vessel now on the Grand Banks, and returning to the port of Lunenburg within the next
fortnight.
I think that business men in
Halifax and other Canadian ports have no
trouble in covering their marine risks. I am
thinking
paricuilarly
of my
honourable
friend in this Chamber who knows a great
deal more about marine matters than I do
(Hon. Mr. Paterson). J am pretty sure he
will agree with me, though sometimes he
may object to the rates which the insurance
companies charge, that he loes not have
mueh dificiulity in securing coverage for his
ships.
I do not like this idea of the
Government going into the insurance business. In the last few years we have been
getting awx'ay from what the Fathers of
Confederation meant when they took action
which was crystallized in the British North

JULY 15, 1942

quite capable of looking after war risks. Therefore I am opposed to the principle of the Bill.
If I read correctly the statement of the
Minister in the House of Commons who sponsored this Bill, I infer that he was sorry he
had ever introduced it. I hope that is not
stating the case too strongly, for I do not want
to put words into the Minister's mouth. I say
again, there is no need for this type of legislation. If, for instance, a German or Italian
warship comes around the point in Lunenburg
and, seeing the Union Jack floating on the
flagstaff near my home, takes a pot shot, I
think the Government should say: "You are a
loyal fellow; you believe in keeping the British
flag flying; and we are going to recommend
that you be paid for the damage you have
suffered."
To my mind this Bill is something like a
cross-word puzzle; it is not at all clear. One
clause provides that the maximum compensation shall be $3,000. But the honourable leader
of the Government bas said that compensation
to a boat-owner would be limited to $2,000.
The honourable senator from Vancouver (Hon.
Mr. McRae) said that not only on the British
Columbia coast, but also on the Great Lakes,
there are ships which cost as much as $50,000,
and on the Atlantic coast we have fishing and
other vessels valued anywhere from $15,000 to
$250,000. Under this legislation, if I understood
the leader of the Government aright, all the
owner of a boat would get for a total loss
would be $2,000.
Hon. Mr. KING: My honourable friend has
misunderstood me. The $2,000 compensation
is to take care of certain types of craft which
are not dealt with in this Bill, but will be

America Act. I do not think it is the function of any Government to enter into business. Government has certain functions with
regard to regulating those who do business.
In my opinion that is what should be done
in this case, instead of setting up a bureaucracy. I doubt very much that the proposed
legislation will be found workable, but if it
should be, I am certain we shall have a
central office here in Ottawa with anywhere
from 500 to 1,000 employees, at great expense
to the taxpayers. Further, in order to make
the operation of the Act effective in regard
to the risks it deals with, you will need
agents of the central office in every little
village and hamlet throughout Canada. This
will cost the taxpayers millions and millions
of dollars at .a time when in my opinion
there is no necessity for such expenditure. I
am in hearty agreement with the idea that
the Government should come to the assistance
of our people, especially those on our two
coasts, where there is greater likelihood of
war damages to homes or fishing boats or
chattels than anywhere else.
My honourable friend the leader of the
Government has said that insurance of the
class of boats which he mentioned would be
worked out by Order in Council. This being
so, why is it necessary to have a Bill oft his
kind? Why not effect its purpose by Order
in Council? Or, if it is considered necessary
to pass such legislation as this to provide for
compensation for war damage to houses and
chattels, why was no provision made with
regard to damage to fishing boats which
might be sunk or lost by enemy action?

day after the commencement of this Act, both
inclusive, lias sustained or sustains loss from
war damage, and if he makes application to
the Minister on or before such thirtieth day
aforesaid, to enter into a contract of insurance
in respect of such property, the Minister may
enter into a contract of insurance in respect
of such property effective from the beginning
of the twenty-fourth day of December, one
thousand nine hundred and forty-one, but the
amount of the indemnity payable under any
sucli contract in respect of war damage to such
property during such period shall not exceed
fifty thousand dollars.
First of all we have this 83,000 indemnity.
Then it is provided that the owner of a
property which has been destroyed between
the 24th of December, 1941, and the thirtieth
day after this Act is passed by this Parliament and receives the Royal Assent, can get
$50,000. In other words, if I insure my house
two mconths after it burns down, I can get
an insurance policy to compensate me for my
loss. Surely there has been no damage in
Canada so far as enemy action is concerned.
Why is that clause in the Bill at all? It is
Such indemnity should become

effective only after the Act bas been passed
and ratified by the Governor General. J want
to know to what class of people the S50,000
indemnity is to be paid.
But the worst clause is the one with regard
to the payment of premiums, and I am
opposed to the Bill because it means that the
Government of Canada is interfering with
private business and private rights, for it is
going to issue policies, perhaps at a lower
rate than that at which the old line conpanies can afford to issue them. Of course
it is possible they may be higher. In any
event, under this Bill the Minister nay decide
the rate or rates of the premium, and the
amount or arnounts of the indennity payable
under the contract. As my honourable friend
has said, the maximum amount as far as
fishing boats are concerned is $2000; but the
Bill provides that the Minister may decide
the amouint that is to be paid, and be may
decide that it shall be $5,000 or $10,000, or
less than the $2.000.
I do net think the Goverrnment has any
right to interfere in any way with, or to go
into, the business of insurance. I can understand that the Government bas a right to
regulate; and if the insurance companies were
to corne to it and say, "There is likely to be
a great deal of damage from the bombing of
towns and cities, and we cannot afford to carry
these risks, but will agree to insure them if
you will stand behind us and make up the
difference should the rates charged net cover
the loss." it would have a right to act. That
would be the sensible thing to do.
Hon. 'Mr. DUFF.

Just a few weeks ago the Government decided, and quite properly, to ration sugar.
It was realized that with the sinking of ships
in the Caribbean and on the Atlantic coast
tonnage had been greatly reduced, and that
we could not hope to get our usual quota of
sugar from Cuba, Jamaica, Trinidad or
Demarara. Unless something was done there
was going to be a shortage of sugar. First
of all, the Covernment appealed to the good,
loyal citizens of the country to curtail their
consumption of sugar, and I am delighted
to know that throughout the country the
people entered into the spirit of the suggestion, and thousands of them voluntarily
reduced their consumption of sugar. Since
then the Government bas decided that sugar
should he rationed, and sugar ration cards
have been issued. But the Government did
net go into the business of buying sugar and
of opening stores to sell half a pound to each
of the citizens of this country.
If the
Government is going into the insurance business, why should it not have gone into the
sugar business also? Why should not the
Minister of Agriculture, instead of controlling
butter, open stores and sell it?
This legisiation is unnecessary because the
insurance companies are in a position to look
after our insurance rtquirenents and to take
care of every loss that may occur in Canada
or on the Atlantic or Pacifie ocean, or on our
inland waters. Therefore I say this legislatien should not pass. The Government could,
if necessary, enter into a contract with the
insurance comapanies and stan(l behind them.
Tîat would be a much better proposition thon
for thte Governmîient to open up a whole suite

SENATE

Lunenburg (Hon. Mr. Duff). I was more
than impressed by what he said, and I
have become convinced I should say at
this stage that my vote in favour of second
reading will be given to facilitate reference
to a committee and should not be interpreted
as indicating my support of the Bill. I
think that from the discussions will emerge
this thought, that any damage caused to
the property of citizens f this country by
enemy action, on the coast or inland, or any
damage attributable directly to the war,
sueh as from explosions of dangerous materials in the course of transit or while in
warehouse awaiting export, should be taken
care of by this country to the limit of its
capacity.
Hon. Mr. CALDER:

Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. COTE: Surely the principle of
indemnity which was applied in the case of
the Halifax catastrophe is a good precedent.
The indemnity receivable by each victim niof
war damage sLould not depend upon whether
or not le las contributed personally to any insurance fiund or purchased a policy. He is
part of a national risk, and if a bomber goes
over his louse it is net through Lis neglect
or on his invitation. It is an act of war.
If ever the principle of solidarity among
the citizens of this country should be recognized, it is wLen one suffers from enemy
action through the choice of the enemy and
net of himself. We all should come to the
rescue in such cases. The cost of compensation should be paid by us all collectively.
In other words, the premium should be
collected, not from the individual sufferer, but
at large, through the process of taxation, over
the whole country.
Hou. Mr. BALLANTYNE:

Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. COTE: It seems to mie that is
the sound principle. I should prefer a scleme
of war indeninity to come out of public
funds; not to indeninify completely the
sufferers from wsar damage-for we could never
hope to do that if the damage were at
all substantial-but to indemnify them in
sone reasonable mueasure. It may be that in
the elaboration of such a scheme exceptions
should be made as against those risks which
the individual, on account of sorne special
feature of his business, would cover by his
own insurance. For instance, if a man desires
to engage in an occupation to which extra
risk is attached, such as Shipping goods by
lon. Mr. COTE.

sea, and if Le hopes to make a profit thereby,
Le possibly should be asked to pay Lis own
premium for protection through an insurance company. But if an ordinary citizen
suffers damage by enemy action simply on
account of the fact that he happens to be
residing in Canada, then I say the country
should extend to him a helping hand, and
his eligibility to reccive help should net
depend upon whether or not Le had the
means to subscribe to an insurance fund
or purchase an individual policy.
Hon. Mr. MacARTHUR: May I ask the
honourable senator what he thinks about increased premiums on soldiers' policies?
Hon. Mr. COTE: I should not like to express an opinion on that feature just now,
because I do net think it Las anything to do
with this Bill, which deals with insurance
against damage on material property.
Hon. Mr. MacARTHUR:
with the war effort.

It all Las to do

On motion of Hon. Mr. Farris, the debate

VOCATIONAL TRAINING
CO-ORDINATION BILL
SECOND

READING

Hon. J. H. KING moved the second reading
of Bill 64, an Act respecting the carrying on
and co-ordination of vocational training.
He said: Honourable senators, the object of
this Bill is the continuation or re-establishment
of the work that was carried on under the
Youth Training Act, which was passed in 1939,
when the late Hon. Norman Rogers was
Minister of Labour. While that Act was in
operation the provinces and municipalities
throughout the country co-operated with the
Dominion Government by making their technical schools and other facilities available, and
some 300,000 young persons were given valuable training. The Act expired last March. It
is proposed to bring the usefulness of that Act
within the scope of this Bill, and to include
other activities that are carried on by the
Air Force in training men; also some of the
work that is being carried on by the Army.
Those activities, combined in this Bill, will be
placed under the Minister of Labour.
This is an important measure and I think
it will receive the endorsement of the Senate.
It is proposed to continue co-operation with
the various provincial governments, so that
men returning from overseas may enjoy an

219

JULY 15, 1942
opportunity for vocational training. After the
last war a department set up for that purpose
did some very effective work. This Bill provides for vocational training not only for
young men and women and older men who
want to go into industry, but also for men
returning from overseas.
I move second reading of the Bill.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill
was read the second time.
REFERRED TO COMMITTEE

Hon. Mr. KING: Though there are not
many amendments to the Act, I think it would
be well to send the Bill to the Standing Committee on Banking and Commerce. Therefore I move that it be referred to that
committee.

The motion was agreed to.

MOTION DROPPED

On the notice of motion by Hon. Mr.

That the Standing Committee on External
Relations be directed to-conduct an inquiry into
the best means of promoting co-operation, in
the spheres of economie, legal, social and cultural
relations, between the Dominion of Canada and
the other nations of the American continents,
and to report the result of such inquiry to the
Senate, and that the said Committee have power
to call for persons, papers and records.

Hon. L. M. GOUIN: Honourable senators,
some time ago I gave notice of my intention
to present this motion for the purpose of
promoting Canada's co-operation with the
other nations of the American continents.

however, that this very important question
should receive the careful consideration of the
Senate as soon as possible next session, for our
country bas a glorious part to play in fostering

inter-American fraternity and solidarity. I am
convinced the time has come for Canada to
co-operate more fully with the other twentyone American nations, which have always regretted our absence from their councils.

We

all have the same vital interest in matters of
defence.

COMMITTEE
Hon. Mr. BLACK: Honourable senators, the

morning.

on the interest it has shown in the development of commercial and diplomatic relations
with South America, and in particular with
nations
and very friendly
those great
Argentina, Brazil, Chile and Ecuador.
Recently the Press has mentioned the fact
that negotiations were being carried on between
Mexico and Canada with a view to the establishment of a legation by each country at the
other's capital. I am convinced the Canadian
people in general will welcome any steps to
secure closer economic and cultural relations
with Mexico, our ally in the present war.
Senor Calderon, the Consul General for

Mexico, a few months ago took the initiative
with his colleagues of the other Central and
South

American

countries

to organize

the

Inter-American Canadian Association. Our
Minister of Trade and Commerce, Hon. Mr.
MacKinnon, was the guest of honour at the
dinner which marked the inauguration of the
newly-formed organization, to which I have

:2U

SENATE

the honour to belong.
Such praiseworthy
initiative really deserves our heartiest encourigement.
By way of conclusion, let me remark that
:ne-third of the population of Canada has
the samne cultural source as the Spanish and
Portugýuese countries
of South America,
namely, Mediterranean civilization. The unfortunate land of our origin, France, has been
the intellectual mother of South Americans
in general evor since the birth of freedom
among them.
Canadians of French origin
are eager to contribute their utmost te the
preservation of this spiritual legacy, not only
in Canada, but in the entire western hemispbere. Our Latin affinities are for us indeed
a source of pride and moral comfort.
An excellent book bas just heen puhlisbed
by my good friend and confrere Professor
Johin Humphrey, of MeGill University. In
his remarkahle study, "The Inter-American
System," the author very ably refers to tbe
future of our intellectual intercourse with
Latin America, which hoe calls the home of a
riclb new-worlcl culture hased on the cultures
of France, Spain and Portugal. I wish to
'link Professer Humphrey very particulariy
for baving so admirahly expiained the part
whîch Freuch-speaking Canadiaus should play
in Latin America as the representatives of
the classie culture that we inherjted from
France in the sevcuteenth century.
In this field of our cultural relations a confereoce entitled "Journées Pan-latines" took
place hast wiuter at the University of Montreal. The consuls representing Latin America
met our distinguished rector, Monseigneur
Maurault, and hiad most friendly contacts
with otir professors and students. A spirit of
real intollectual brotherhood marked ail these
gatheriugs.
A permancnt organization has
becn created under the name of "Union Culturelle des Latins d'Amcriquce." The association thus formed by the intelligentsia of our
youuger goncration bas continued to grow,
and I arn convinccd that it xviii develop into
a most fruitfui exebange of professors and
pupils hotu ecu the universities of Canada and
those of Latin America.
I have this suhject very much at heart, and
I regret that it wiil be necessary to wait until
next session before we eau proceed witb the
study of this most iuteresting question. I
beg leave te asic that, for the time being, this
motion be dropped.
The motion wvas dropped.
Hon. Mr. GOUIN.

WAR RISK INSURANCE BILL
SECOND

RlEADING

The Sonate resumed from yesterday the
adjourued debate on the motion of Hon. Mr.
King for the second reading of Bill 56, an Act
to make provision with respect te insurance
of property against war risks and the payment
of compensation for war damage.
Hon. J. W. deB. FARRIS: Honourable
senators, we hiad yesterday a very interesting
discussion on this Bill, particularly by the
honeurable senator from Lunenburg (Hon.
Mr. Duif). Ho was cautious enougb to state
in opening that he did net understand the
Bill and was labouring in the fog in which hoe
found himself.
Notwithstanding that, my
bonourable friend made a very strong impression, I think, especially on some honourable
merubers opposite.
And that impression
appoars te have extended abroad, since I
notice it bias heen featured in this morniug's
Montreai Gazette and other papers. Iu ordi.nary circumstances seme of the difficuities
rnight ho ciearcd up in conimittee, when the
Bill reaches that stage, but in view of the
puhhicity that bias hoon gix on the subject I
think il well that we should briefly review the
Bill now in this Houise. I feel that some of
the criticismn mado ycsterday by mv honourable frieud frein Lunenburg would net have
heen made if ho liad waited until the fog hiad
ciearcd up. ln saying that, 1 take it 1 amn
paving him a bigh compliment, hecauso it wvas
oniy on account of bis strong personality and
persuasiv e words that in the circumistances hie
was able te makýe the vcry deep impression
hoe did.
1 gatbered the impression from him that
this Bill had heen prepared in a rather
haphazard way and had net been carefully
thoughit through, but if honourable members
wilhl check up they xviii fiud this was net the
case. The Bill was introdueed in another
place at March, at whicb time the Minister
explained its principle. It was thon left over
util after the Easter vacation, and since the
sittings of the other House wore resuimed it
bas been under discussion and consideration,
ecither in Committee of the Whoie or at other
stages in the House itself or iu its Banking
and Commerce Committee, until oniy a few
days age. Besides. before the Bill was introdîied, eue of the most capable aud distingiii.,hc cotinsel who could ho sc cured for the
work was engaged te go ail over the couutry,
from Halifax te Victoria, and aise te Washington, te make a special study of this question.
1 refer te Mr. D'Arcy Leonard, wbo, as
bonourable members wbo are lawyers know,
bas specialized in this branch of the lauw. Ho

JULY 16, 1942
made a full and exhaustive report te the
Minister. In addition a competent interdepartmental committee was appointed and
worked with Mr. Leonard. The services of
our well-known and efficient Superintendent
of Insurance were secured, and repeated conferences were had with high officials of
insurance companies and others competent te
pass judgment on the question. All this
indicates the thorough care given te the
preparation of the measure.
I ask honourable senators te consider with
me what the Bill really does, because a
knowledge of that will answer some of the
This Bill
criticisins made here yesterday.
deals distinctly with three matters. First, it
provides for insurance by the Government
against war damage te property on land, the
governing section being No. 3. May I read
the first paragraph?
The Minister may, on behalf of His Majesty,
enter into a contract of insurance with any
person te insure against the risk of war damage,
any property in which such person bas an
insurable interest.
In the interpretation clause we are reminded
what is included and what is not included
in the term "property."
It will be observed that in this section there
is no limit te the amount of the insurance. We
heard reference yesterday te coverage of
$50,000, $3,000, $2,000. In the working out
of the Act the usual principles governing
insurable interest will be applicable.
For
instance, in the payment for loss the weilknown insurance principle will apply that you
will be paid, only for the loss sustained.
But I would impress on honourable members
that, except for such qualifications, there is no

limit te the amount of insurance that may
be effected in the contract made with the
Minister.
The scheme of this Bill is for insurance of
property in Canada. It is not a marine
insurance bill. And "property" here has certain exclusives; that is, it does not include
land on which there are no structures; nor
growing crops nor trees; nor ships after they
are launched and equipped for sailing; nor
freight on the seas. It does include freight on
our inland waters, which in general terms
means wheat in transit across the Great Lakes
and on to the ocean. Such is the primary
purpose of this Bill. The Bill does not provide for hazards on the sea-marine insurance.
There was a good deal of discussion yesterday about the insurable value of ships and
the opportunity te place marine insurance.
My honourable friend from Lunenburg (Hon.
Mr. Duff) said that you could place marine

insurance, for he had had that experience,
having arranged for $24,000 insurance on a
vessel out of Lunenburg now on the Grand
Banks. That simply confirms and does not
attack the policy underlying this Bill.
In support of my statement that the Bill
provides for land insurance, since the insurance companies are not handling that business,
and does not touch marine insurance at all,
I read this paragraph from the speech which
the Minister made in the other House when
the Bill was under consideration there:
I have the most deep-seated objection to
mixing a marine insurance scheme with a land
insurance scheme. They do not do it anywhere,
so far as I know-neither in Great Britain
nor the United States nor anywhere else. The
two kinds of business are different. Everything about a marine insurance scheme is
different from a land insurance scheme, and
I must stand firm on that-that we shall not
run these marine risks in with land risks.
What is proper for a certain rate on land is
different from a rate on water. The risk is
different, the nature of the business is different,
the adjustment is different, the rules are
different. For one thing, losses on land are
adjusted on the basis of actual loss. It is like
fire insurance: if I take out $10,000 insurance
on my house, and it burns down, and the bouse
turns out to be worth only $6,000, then I get
only $6,000. The reverse, I am told, is true of
marine insurance; the value is determined in
advance and adherea to regardless of what the
actual loss may be. That is a vital distinction.
I cannot mix up these two plans.
We have no Canadian Government plan of
marine insurance, but commercial insurance is
available.
As I have already stated, my honourable
friend from Lunenburg has confirmed the
fact that commercial insurance is available,
for be said he had placed insurance on a
vessel sailing out of Lunenburg.
Hon. Mr. DUFF:
Will my honourable
friend pardon me? I said war risk insurance.
That is what this Bill covers; not marine
m.surance.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: This Bill does not
cover war risk insurance on ships sailing on
the sea. That is the point I make. The
Minister has said in the paragraph I have
just quoted from his speech that according
te the policy of the Government war risk
marine insurance is still to be handled by
the commercial insurance companies, just as
my honourable friend said it should be
handled. That fact should be kept in mind.
But I think
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE:
that in fairness te the honourable senator
from Lunenburg it should be pointed out that
he was referring only te the $2,000 insurance
on small ships.

222

SENATE

Hon. Mr. FARRIS: This Bill has nothing
to do with that at all. I shall come to that
point later. I am not criticizing my honourable friend from Lunenburg; I am simply
stating what are the principles of this Bill.
i say its primary purpose is to provide for
insurance of property on land in Canada, and
the only exceptionHon. Mr. COTE: Or'on water in Canada.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: The only exception to
the land phase is freight on the inland lakes
and waters of Canada. The Minister in the
other House intimated that the time might
corne when it would be necessary to introduce a bill dealing with marine insuranceor, as my honourable friend from Lunenburg
prefers to put it, dealing with war risks in
regard to ships sailing on the sea. We are
not here to discuss whether that time bas
arrived or net. I am only indicating the
scope of the present measure. In his report,
which I have before me, Mr. Leonard points
out that in the United States and in Great
Britain there is a scheme by which war risks
on the sea are at least in part covered, and
ie intimates that the time might come when
we should seek co-operation with Great
Britain and the United States to get the
advantage of their provisions in this respect.
The Minister said that so far no request had
been made of the Government to take such
action.
From my study and analysis of the Bill I
think this explanation disposes of what is its
basic principle, what it contains, and what,
for the purrpos-s of our discussion, is of equai
importance, wiat it does not contain.
Honourable members will recall that what
we have been discussing under section 3 is
more or less a business relationship between
the Government and the person seeking insurance. I doubt that you can say it is entirely
a business relationship, because, if it were,
the matter might have been left to the insurance companies. But it is of necessity a
bursrness relationship in which the Government unecrtakes for a premium to carry insurance on property on land.
In contrast to this I desire to direct the
attention of honourable members to another
feature of this Bill-one contained in section 7. This provides that if the dwellinghouse in which a person ordinarily resides
and of which lie is the owner is destroyed by
one of the hazards of war, be may receive
compensation, without his having effected any
rnsurance, to a maximum of $3,000. Section 8
provides that in the event of damage to
chattels in the house the householder may be
compensated, on a sliding scale, up to $800,
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE

whieh may be increased by $400 if he is
married, and by an additional $100 for each
child. That is not insurance at all; that is
straight compensation after the event. It is in
a sense the very principle that my honourable
friend from Lunenburg was advocating yesterday. These sections do not attempt, of course,
to cover fully every devastation that may
happen in Canada by compensation after the
event; but they do undertake in advance,
should a householder lose his home by a
bomb or other explosion, to compensate him
up to $3,000 on that account, and also to
compensate him for damage to his chattels.
I come now to the retroactive feature of
the Bill in section 6, where the maximum
figure of $50,000 appears. I agree with my
honourable friend from Lunenburg that the
section is peculiarly worded. I think if I had
hîad the responsibility of drafting it I would
have adopted a less ingenious method of
expression; but that is neither bere nor there.
However, the purpose of the section is clear.
All it means, in short, is this. Canada bas for
some months been threatened with danger of
war damage, and presumably the Government
thougbt that during the delay between the
preparation of this Bill and its enactment
everybody ought to bave some provision for
security in the event of damage happening
before there was an opportunity to place
insurance. For that purpose this Bill provides
that if a man's property is damaged by a
war hazard before this Bill is operative, be
may seek compensation therefor just as if he
had been insured; but withr this 850,000 limitation.
Suppose ie bas a property worth
$500,000. When this measure is enacted he
might insure for that amount, and if the
property were destroyed be would be paid his
full insurance.
But under this retroactive
provision, it was recognized, the Government
could not possibly pay that, and so it set a
maximum of $50.000. That figure is simply
a maximum in regard to retrospective
damages in cases of the kind for which insurance may be effected after the Bill comes into
force. So there should be no attempt to draw
a comparison with the $50,000, the $3.000, and
the $2,000. They relate to different things
and different purposes, and are based on
entirely different principles.
Yesterday some honourable senators discussed a feature that is not in this Bill at all.
I refer to the compensation of S2,000 to
fishermen. That is provided for by an Order
in Council dated July 3 of this year. It will
be found in the Votes and Proceodings of the
House of Commons for July 6. That Order
in Council was passed under the War Measures

JULY 16, 1942
Act and places the administration of this particular provision in the Department of
Fisheries. The measure now before the House
is under the Department of Finance. The
Order in Council defines a fishing boat and
fishing gear, and provides that if a fisherman
has hais boat destroyed or damaged by a war
hazard, the Minister of Fisheries may7 pay to
hiim on ffhat account a ýýum nlot excceding
S2,0007 and for lis nets a sum flot exceeding
$400. provided hoe has. fot been indemnified
by insurance.

Hon. Mr. MacLENNAN: Also that insurance is free.

H-on. Mr. FARRIS: If is not insurance at
ail; there is no premium or anything else
paid for if.
Now, honourable members shuuld not,
because of that, say tliat the present Bill is
open f0 criticism; neither, I think, should
they cven say th-af the Order in Council is
open to criticism. It was not intended to
make provision for ships worth $250,'000,
such as my bonourable friend mentioned. If
was not intended f0 make provision for s ips
worth 850,000.
1 have read to you the
Minister's policy in regard f0 marine insurance for war risk. It is that until some new
necessity arises, until some demand comes
from the owners of ships, it wiil lie lef t to
the owncrs to t ake ouf war risk insurane
wif h companies that write that kind of
insurance.
But complaint was made that
there are small fishermen on the Atlantic
coast and on the Pacifie coast who are unable
to get marine insurance, and others who, even
if they are able to get it, sometimes neglect
to do so. In the result the country cannot
afford to have these men taking fhe hazards
and losing their means of livelihood without
compensation.
So, purely on the basis of
that idea, and under the administration of
another department alfogether, this provision
of $2,000 was put in. To repeat: this has
nothing f0 do with the question of insurance
for large ships, and it has nothing to do with
fhe Bill now under consideration.
That, honourable gentlemen, covers the
scope of the Bill we are now considering,
except for its details, whieh we shahl have to
discuss in committee.
There are, however,
certain other criticisms which were very
forcibly made against the Bill yesterday.

The

honourable

senator

from

Lunenburg

said that fhe Government should not go into
the insurance business. WIy not, I ask. I

gathered

that

one of the reasons for his

statement was that f0 do so would be to
enter into unfair competition with the insur-

ance companies.

I submait, honourable memr-

bers. that there is nothing unfair about if.
The' insurance companies are flot wvilling f0

wvrîfe this kind of insurance.

I am falking,

flot about marine insurance, but the brand
of insurance covered hy tbis Bill. We know
this f0 be s0 from Mr. Leonard's report;
and if was ascertained also by ftie members
of fhe other buse in their long discussions.
Insurance is effecfed in consideration of
premiums wvhieh are fixed on the lasis of
the liazards involved, and in fthe liglif of
pasf experience in regard f0 such risks. But
when we come f0 the situation now facing
this country, and flie possibilify of some
munitions plant exploding, thie repetition of

what happened in Halifax, or the effeef of the
dropping of bombs, no mechanics of flguring
by tlie insurance companies can give us the
information required. As a matter of facf,
the insurance companies do not want this
type of insurance, and for f bis reason my
honourable friend is not speaking on their
-bebaîf or with their sanction. Therefore, if
the business is flot wanfed by the insurance
companies, if they are refusing f0 liandle if,
and our people are confronfed wif h the
peril which makes this kind of insurance
necessary, who except the Governmcnf can

meet fthe necessity of the occasion?
This projeef may be underfaken in one
of two wsys. If may be undertaken in the
way which is proposed in this Bill, or by
ftle Government saying f0 the insurance
companies, "You do the business and we
wili guaraotce you ag-ainst loss," or, as someone lias expressed if, thougli I am not quite
sure that it is correct in the circumrsfances,
"Wc wili underwrif e the insurance."
My honourable friend from Lunenburg said
yesterday, and if was repeated by others, that
the great objection f0 flic metliod adopted
by the Government is fIat it would require
a vast organizafion witb from 500 f0 1,000
officers or employees; fliaf there would be a
large central office in Ottawa, and agents
scatfered ail over flic Dominion of Canada.
Now, I have liere Mr. D'Arcy Leonard's
report, and I fhink if is important fIat
lionourable members should understand fliat
bis report. made affer thorougli investigation,
is flic basis of f bis Bill. What does lie say?
This ilisurance -would bie made availabie
througli the insurance comipanies, who have
offered their services to the Government on a
non-profit basis, as have also the Association
of Agents.

Thaf means thaf fhe insurance companies of
this country, and flic agents, as a contribution
f0 the war effort-a contribution sudh as
'everybody is making in some form or another

SENATE
-have offered their services and facilities at
cost. These will be very valuable. There will
be some abuses, of course, as there always are
abuses by someone; but on the whole the
offer will be fairly and honourably carried
out. Mr. Leonard says:
In contemplating the administrative set-up
for sueh a scheme, it appears to me to require
the minimum of machinery of any plan that
might be adopted.
I miglit point out to honourable members
that I had the pleasure this morning of
conversing with Mr. Matson, who is to be the
new controller. He is the head of an insurance
organization in Montreal to-day. No doubt
many bonourable senators know him and are
aware of bis excellent record in business.
From him I gathered that apart from the
central office there will be no organization
set up by the Covernment, and the central
office will be required chiefly to receive and
keep account of the returns sent in by
insurance agents throughout Canada. That,
it would seem to me, largely removes any
apprebension
on the score of expense.
Furthermore, let me point out that it is Mr.
Leonard's studied opinion that that is the
cheapest way in which that work can be done.
But there are other factors. My honourable
friend from Lunenburg said that we should
not have this insurance at ail; that we should
do as was done in the case of the Halifax
calamity-wait for the event and then come
in and compensate everybody. I say that
to a limited extent, in regard to householders,
that is provided for in the Bill. But surely
in this great industrial country no form of
business enterprise should be allowed to go
without insurance, and left so that after the
event we should pay the whole cost. How
impractical that would be! Take the grain
business, for instance. I am told by grain
men that banking is closely associated with
the grain business, and that financing is
essential to the trade. I am told that inability
on the part of those engaged in that trade to
show the banks that they have insurance has
a direct effect on their financing. Will it be
sufficient to give an indefinite statement that
something like what happened after the Halifax
disaster is going to happen again? Business
cannot be carried on by such methods. The
practical thing to do is to enable these men
to place insurance on their property, so that
when a loss occurs the matter may be dealt
with in a business-like manner.
Then when it comes to the question of cost,
let us compare the cost of this method with
that of reinsuring. If this matter were left
entirely in the hands of the insurance companies they would be entitled to a profit, and
they would not be prepared to give their
Hon. Mr. FARRIS.

services at cost. Under the present scheme
the Government assumes no more liability than
it would under the other, and the whole operation is carried out without profit in any
quarter.
It has been suggested that to be effective
this insurance should be compulsory, as it is
in England. But the need is urgent, and if
this legislation is to be of any use we should
have it this year. Therefore we must have a
scheme which will be put into operation as
quickly as possible. If we make the scheme
compulsory we shall run into complicated
questions in regard to valuations. If it is
voluntary we need not worry about overvaluation, because the values will be appraised
when the loss is adjusted. If we have compulsory insurance we shall encounter the problem of people under-insuring in order to escape
the payment of premiums. Every municipality
has its own basis of valuation, and it would be
necessary to set up new machinery throughout
the country-local machinery-to adjust these
differences.
If the presaut system shows the necessity
of compulsory insurance at a later date, such
a system can then be put into effect.
Now, that covers about ail I have to .ay in
explanation of this Bill and ln reply to the
criticisms which have been made. My honourable friend from Saint John (Hon. Mr. Foster)
was good enough to give me last night a copy
of the rules and regulations of the War Damage
Corporation of the United States. These
became effective on July 1. That organization
is a subsidiary of the great Reconstruction
Finance Corporation of the United States, and
makes provision for the insurance of war risks
in that country. As we were told yesterday,
the British Government also has made provisions of this nature. These systems were
studied by officials before this Bill was prepared. There is one thing I want to point out
in connection with the United States regulations which came into effect only this month.
In the American scheme there is provision for
the coverage of standing timber. There is no
such provision in our Bill, the reason being, I
understand, that it was said it would not be
practical.
On the Pacifia coast, in British
Columbia, we have great timber areas, and
adjoining them are the great timber areas of
Washington, Oregon and California. If under
the American policy coverage can be provided
for war damage to those areas in the United
States, I feel that the Government of this
country should make it possible to have our

exception it seems to me we are following
very closely in the steps of countries which
have experimented with war risk insurance. I

amrn ot one who thinks we 8houid adopt a
policy simply because it has been adopted elsewhere, but I firmly believe that every progressive nation should be ready at ail times to
study what is going on ini others and to profit
by their experience.
For these reasons I support this Bill.
Hon. C. C. BALLANTYNE: Honourable
senators, the bonourable gentleman from Vancouver South (Hon. Mr. Farris), with his
clear mind and great ability, has very lucidly
explained the details of this Bill. But the
details were not under discussion yesterday;
it was the principle of the Bill we were dealing with. My honourable friend bas missed
the trend of the argument by the honourabie
senator from Lunenburg (Hon. Mr. Duif),
who feels, as do some of us on this side,
that the Government should flot enter into
this war risk, insurance at ail. I arn not prepared to say there will neyer be any war
damage in Canada. My honourable friend
opposite (Hon. Mr. Farris) seems to assume
there will 'be some, tbough hie does not say
so. What I feel is that the Government ought
to leave land insurance alone. Does the
honourable senator think the tirne bas arrived
for the Government to undertake land insurance and war risk as outiined by this Bill?
It is just possible that we may flot suifer
any war damage on land at ail. Let us hope
that we neyer do. Wouid it not be as well ta
wait, and, if damages occur, have them
adjusted equitably at the time? The Halifax
disaster is not a fair analogy at ail, because
that was caused by a great explosion and the
damage was on a very beavy scule.
if we are ever sheiled by the enemy on
either coast, there will be some d-amage bere
and there, but surely my honourable friend
does not expeet that in this country enemy
action wili have the saine devastating effeets
it bas had in some of the large cîties of
England, such as Coventry, London and Liverpool. Great Britain was perfectly justified
in providing war risk insurance, but can we
not let things simply go on just as tbey are?
I know that to do so would be to assume
a certain amount of risk; but wbat is the
matter with that, and wby should the Government not adjust any war damages as they
occur, and reimburse the actual suiferers on
a fair and bonest scale? My honourable
friend does not toueh on that at ail, and. I
should lilce to know bis opinion about it.
Tbe motion was agreed to, and the Bill
was read the second time.

VETERANS' LAND BILL
FIRST READING

A message was reccived from the House of
Commons with Bill 65, an Act to assist war
veterans to settle upon the land.
The Bill was read the first time.
REINSTATEMENT IN CIVIL EMPLOYMENT BILL
REPORT OF COMMITTEE

Hon. F. B. BLACK presented, and moved
concurrence in, the report of the Standing
Committee on Banking and Commerce on
Bill 5, an Act to provide for the reinstatement
in civil employment of discharged members
of His Majesty's Forces or other designated
classes of persons.
He said: Honourable senators, the committee has made certain slight amendments in
this Bill, which do not in any instance affect
its meaning or purport.
The motion was agreed to.
THIRD READING

Hon. J. H. KING moved the third reading
of the Bill.
Hon. L. COTE: Honourable senators, this
Bill was fully considered in the Banking and
Comnerce 'ommittee, where I was present,
anud I will not deal with the measure at any
length now. From the explanations given
in cooimittee it

appears that the purpose of

the Bill is to place on employers of labour
ion. Mr. COTE.

the statutory duty of reinstating in their
employment persons who have been discharged from the armed services of this
country and who at the time of enlistment
had been employed by such employers for at
least three months.
This duty becomes
operative whenever the former employee
ceases to be a member of the armed forces
and seeks re-employment, whether during the
war or after the cessation of hostilities. That
such an obligation should be imposed upon
employers of labour no one will dispute.
Indeed, it is the kind of patriotic obligation
that every employer should himself be ever
ready and willing to assume, without the need
of any law making failure to assume it an
offence punishable by way of prosecution and
summary conviction. The obligation to treat
ex-servicemen in a fair way-I will net say in
a generous way, because it is only a question
of fair dealing-should really flow from the
employer's own conscience, but, as I said in
committee, I am not opposed to making the
obligation more than a moral one, and 1
favour the purpose of this Bill, to make the
obligation legal.
During consideration of the Bill in conmittee the point arose and became abundantly
clear, and the evidence there given supported
it, that, whatever might be our hopes regarding the operation and effect of this measure,
unfortunately only a small portion of exservice men could be reinstated under this
proposed law. The reason is quite obvious.
We know now that, as a result of abnormal
conditions brought about by the necessity
of manufacturing great quantities of munitions and war supplies, an employer of labour
whose normal working force is 50 men may
have had to increase it to 1,000, and that the
turnover due to enlistments may be another
1,000. We know full well that when the war
comes te an end that employer of labour will
not be able to re-engage his returned men.
His manufacturing activities will return to
normal and ho will only be able to take on
his pay-roil 50 men all lold.
In committee I expressed the hope that this
Bill will not be offered as an inducement to
our yong men to enlist, and with that
reservation I shall vote for the measure. I do
not think that it would be either fair or
honourable for the Parliament of Canada to
make an express promise to our young men
by statute and induce them to enlist by
saying to them: "Go and serve your country.
W e have passed legislation so that upon your
return the job you left will be still available
to vo."
Suppose this Bill, when enacted, is used for
such a purpose. It gives me the shivers to

JULY 21, 1942
think what will happen when, after the war,
these young men who enlisted upon the
strength of such a representation come back
to Canada battle-weary and battle-scarred,
eager te get married and establisb a home,
and hungry for, and entitled to, a job through
which these legitimate desires of theirs can
be carried into effect, and we say to them: "We
are very sorry, but you cannot have that job."
They will retort: "It was promised to us
by Parliament." And suppose, repeating that
we are very sorry, we add: "But we passed
that legislation to induce you to enlist. It
was necessary to do se, because we did net
want te have any other system of enlistment
for overseas service." Well, should we have
te make that reply, I could not possibly tell
you what the answer of those men would be,
for certainly it would not be couched in any
language that could be uttered in Parliament.
This brings me to another point. The other
day when the Bill was read a second time I
asked the leader of the Government: "Is this
law intended to be enforced after the ceasing of
hostilities?" He promptly answered "Yes."
The answer is according to the terms of the
law. Then I asked: "What about the question
of legality? Can this Parliament now enact
a statute dealing purely with a matter of civil
rights, that is, a contract of eniployment, that
statute to have effect after the emergency is
over?" That point was discussed in committee. The Law Clerk of this House gave it
as his opinion that it was at least doubtful
whether, after the cessation of hostilities, this
law could be sustained; but he indicated a
circumstance which, to my mind, would weigh
in favour of its being sustained even after the
war comes to an end: that circumstance is the
necessity of passing this law to induce men
te join the armed forces.

Hon. Mr. COPP: Do I understand the bonourable gentleman te say that someone suggested that the Bill was for this purpose?
Hon. Mr. COTE: No. He suggested that
that would be a ground upon which it could be
supported after the war. In other words, we
could pass this statute now to help Canada in
its war effort by offering this as an inducement
for men to enlist, and no court could say that
such a motive was not connected with the
emergency, or that such use of legislation was
improper. If we can pass the measure now to
help in the war effort, we can defend it in
court after the war and say that the re-employment feature is a part of the same transaction.
The first part of the transaction is the passing
of the statute as an inducement to bring men
into the army. The second part, the reinstatement-that is, the delivery of the consideration
44567-15J

-would

become effective after the war. If the

measure could be defended on that ground, my
fears as to the constitutionality of the law

after the war would, I think, be dispelled.
But unfortunately I an still left with the
great fear that in our attempt to embody in
the law the principle of compulsory re-employment we are doing something which I will not

qualify as dishonourable, but which may net
be quite fair te the men who are going to act
upon it.

Hon. J. A. CALDER: May I ask the bonourable gentleman a question? I understand
that he has some doubt as to the constitutionality of the law in se far as its operation after

the war is concerned.

I can understand the

passing of such legislation under the War
Measures Act, which gives the Government
power to do almost anything it pleases in connection with the war. But Parliament is
separately passing this particular law. Has the

honourable gentleman any doubt in his mind
as te the constitutionality of Parliament pass-

ing this law at this time?
Hon. Mr. COTE: That is exactly the point
I raise. There lies my doubt. If the Government bad acted by way of Order in Council
under the War Measures Act, then, according

te the very terms of that Act, if my recollection is correct, the effect of the Order in

Council would terminate with hostilities.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Yes.
Hon. Mr. COTE: But this Bill is net se
framed. Its operation will continue after the
end of hostilities. In fact, if it did net, the
Bill would net mean very much, because it

would be of advantage only to those men who
come back during the war. It would net mean
anything to those who come back after the
war is over, and they will easily be the greater
number. For that reason, instead of proceeding by Order in Council, the Government bas
introduced this Bill. It is only by means of
a Bill passed by Parliament that the Government can attempt te project into the future
the operation of what is by its very character
a war measure. By war legislation, of course,
we can trench directly upon civil rights and
the powers wich belong exclusively te the
provinces. As war legislation for the duration

of the war this Bill is good, beyond any doubt.
But will it continue to be good when the war
comes te an end?
Hon. J. A. CALDER: Honourable members, I did net have an opportunity te attend
the meeting of the committee when it was
dealing with this Bill, but it appears te me
that the honourable gentleman who has just

SENATE

2z

spoken has raised a question of the very first
importance.
We know what the Bill purports to do. If it becomes law, it may not
be sound law. In a word, we are telling all
the enlisted men, "Here is the law which we
are passing,

but according

to the statement

we have just hoard, this law, not only after
the war, but at the present time may be unconstitutional." It seems to me that before
the Bill is read the third time we should have
a clear statement from the Department of
Justice to the effect that it believes this law
to be constitutional.
I doubt very much
that without such a statement we should place
our stamp of approval on the Bill.
I am not opposed to the principle of the
Bill, but it is my opinion that if the law, with
all its promises, should turn out to be unsound and ineffective, there would be a terrible
row in this country. If a statement from the
Department of Justice such as I have referred
to bas not already been made, I would ask
that it be given to us before the Bill is read
the third time.
Hon. JAMES MURDOCK: Surelv, honourabie senators, it is consistent te go as far as
we possibly can to guarantce to those who go
and fight for Canada that when they return
from the war they will be reinstated in their
former jobs.
Hon. Mr. CALDER:
the power to do it.

But you have not

Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: We all know that
when the war is over tens of thousands of the
jobs that men are going from to-day will no
longer exist, because those jobs have been
created to meet the artificial demand of war
industries during the past two years. But what
has that to do with a reasonable application
of the policy that where the jobs are in
existence men returning from the war should
be reinstated?
Undoubtedly tbousands of
young fellows will be disappointed on their
return because, by reason of the war being
over, the jobs they left will no longer exist.
It seems to me, however, that what we are
trying to do in this Bill is to provide, as far
as possible, that they iiiav go back to their
former employment.
Hon. C. P. BEAUBIEN: Honourable senators, one point, I think, lias been missed. It
is said that certain powers which now reside
in the Federal Government will cease witi
the war, and that if they do, any undertakings
which we project now, and which we have a
right to project, will be of no effect after the
war. Personally I cannot bring myself to any
such conclusion. Either we now have a right
to make contracts, whatever they may bo, or
we have not. If we have tîat right we are
Hon.

aIr.

CALDIE.

bound by the contracts we make, and after the
war is over we shall still be bound by them,
because we made them at a time when we
had full power to do se.
Just think of the consequences of any
different interpretation.
Thousands of contracts, I tlink J could perhaps say hundreds
of thousands, have been made under the War
Measures Act. Are they to be of no avail
after the war? Verv few of them, I think,
will b eut short by the declaration of peace.
As we all know, a great nany contractors
have made special arrangements with the
Government to carry out their contracts. If
peace should come all of a sudden, are these
contracts to be invalid? If such a conclusion
is correct, then the legislation we are passing
is net only absurd. but impossible. In a word,
it is a swindie.
One of the essentials of validity in a contract is that both parties when they enter into
it-not later on-shall have the power to
make the contract.
J cannot imagine that
the Government believes otherwise.
That
must be the Government's interpretation; it
cannot bo anything else. Again, this contract
is an undertaking whîich, like thousands of
others, will have its application; and te
conclude that it lias no application would to
my mind result in a situation which would
be incredible. I cannot bring nyself te such
a conclusion at all.
Hon. A. C. HARDY: Honourable senators,
I want to express in a very few words my full
concurrence in what bas been said by the
honourable senators from Ottawa East (Hon.
Mr. Coté) and Saltcoats (Hon. Mr. Calder),
both as to their agreement with the principle
of the Bill and as to their ideas on its
constitutionality and the almost complete
impossibility of xvorking it out. There is no
question that once peace has been declared
this matter will become one of civil rights
ond will be within provincial jurisdiction.
The reason I intend to support the Bill
is that I regard it as only a temporary
measure.
For the next year or two years
we shall have men coming back in comparatively small uumbers, and it is possible,
even probable, that tbis measure may be invoked in order to assist these relatively few
men.
As has been pointed out, when men
begin to come back in great masses, after the
cessation of hostilities, it will be quite another thing. Jn my opinion the Bill will
last for the duration of the war only. As one
honourable gentleman has pointed out, the
measure may lead to confusion worse confounded when we have tens of thousands of
men coming back. But we are in a confused
state now-I do not know that there could

JULY 21, 1942
be a very much more confused state than we
have at present-and I be-lieve we shall just
have to meet conditions when tbey corne. If
anyone could produce a better 'bill than this,
every mernber of the Senate wouId ha gIad to
support it, but I doubt whether at this
date in the session 'the measure could be
arnended so as to get rid of the objections
that have been pointed out. I cannot see a
chance of our getting anything better, and for
that reason I shahl support the Bill, though
with no littie rehuctance.
Hon. Mr. KING: Honourable senators, I
do flot in.tend to diseuss the ýconstitutionality of the Bill, except to say that the
question was raised in cornnttee of the other
Huse, and it was there stated that the
Department of Justice considered tbis to
be good hegisdation, witbin tbe power of
Parliarnent te pass.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: May I ask the hionourable leader a question? Who gave that
evidence before the cornmittee?
Hon. Mr. KING: I understand it came
from the Departrnent of Justice.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Such a statement
should corne official]y before this Chamber.
Hon. Mr. KING: I can get it, if that is
desired.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: We shouhd have that
offlcially, before this Bill gets its third reading.
The Governm*ent must take the
responsibility.
Hon. Mr. KING: I think the Government
bas taken the responsihility, on the advice
of the Departrnent of Justice.
Hon. Mr. CALDER:
The Governrnent
must take the responsih.ility of stating that
in the opinion of the Department of Justice
this measure is constitutional.
Hon. Mr. KING: I tbink the Goveroment
bas already taken that responsibility.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: Did the Department of Justice say this legishation- would be
valid aftcr the war?
Hon. Mr. KING: I believe the statement
was that this legislation is wi'thin the power
cf Parliament te pass and is good legisiation.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE:
Now. But
what about after the war?
Hon. Mr. KIN-,G: I wÀiii
deal witb that later.
I wish te rephy te rny honourable friend
frein Ottawa East (Hon. Mr. Coté). I think
ho over-extend-ed bis argument wben hie indicated that tbe Bill was being used as a

229

bribe te get men to enlist. I do net
heliex-e tbat that has been in the mmnd of the
Governrnen-t at ail].
Hon. Mr. COTE: I said an inducement.
Hon. Mr. KING: Or an inducernent. We
know it bas net been used as an inducement
up te date, and I tbink the inference is quite
unf air. My honourable friend knows that
simihar hegishation bas been passed in Great
Britain, New Zealand and Australia, for the
sarne reason tbat we are seeking to bave tbis
Bill passed bere, in order te impose a legal
obligation upon employers te reinstate former
emphoyees at tbe end cf tbeir period cf
service in tbe armed forces. Tbat is the onhy
desire cf the Geverninent, and tbe Bill bas
.net been used te induce men te enlist.
On the question wbetber tbe hegisiation
weuhd be enforceable after tbe war, I arn
informed that tbe Departrnent cf Justice
advised tbe Government tbat it would be.
If rny honourable friend wouhd like further
assurance on tbat peint I shall try te get it
fer birn.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: There is a
question that botbers me, as a layman. Tbe
bonourable senater from Ottawa East (Hon.
Mr. Coté) made it very chear tbat tbe
Government couhd bave put tbrough tbis
hegisiation under the War Measures Act and
it would bave heen quite constitutional, but
that tbis measure, if passed by Parliament,
weuhd net be censtitutional even during tbe
war.
Hon. Mr. COPP: My honourable friend's
colleague did net say that.
Hon. Mr. COTE: Oh, it is good during tbe
war.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE:' I understood
my bonourable friend te say that inasmucb
as this bad not been passcd under tbe War
Measures Act, it was unconstitutional new.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: He wilh net say that.
Hon. Mr. COTE: I muàt bave expressed
myseif badly.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: I understood
bim to doubt that the hegishation wouhd be
constitutional after being passed by Parliament.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: What, in principle,

drew from my remarks? I was endeavouring
te make it quite clear that so far as the period
of the war is concerned, whether the provision
is passed by Order in Council, under the War
Measures Act, or by statute, there is no doubt
about its validity. I did say that if it had
been passed under the War Measures Act
the operation of the Order in Council would
undoubtedly terminate at the end of the war;
and with regard to the Bill before us I expressed some doubt as to whether its operation
could bc projected into the peace period.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Honourable senators,
I withdraw any objection I raised to the Bill.
I understood, as did the honourable leader on
this side (Hon. Mr. Ballantyne), that there
was a doubt whether this measure would be
constitutional even at the present time. The
honourable senator from Ottawa East (Hon.
Mr. Coté) now says that is not so. Therefore, and in the light of the assurance given
by the honourable leader of the House (Hon.
Mr. King), I withdraw any objection I had
to the Bill.
Hon. JOHN T. HAIG: Honourable senators,
I like the principle of the Bill, but I am afraid
I cannot agree with the honourable member
from Saltcoats (Hon. NIr. Calder). The honourable senator from Ottawa East (Hon. Mr.
Coté) stated we had the constitutional right
to pas the legislation now, but he was concorned over another point, and that is the one
that worries me. When the war is over will
thre Act be any good, or will some enterprising
soli(-itor succeed in contending that it no longer
is constitutional? What I should like to have
an opinion on fron the Department of Justice
is whether the legislation will be constitutional
when peace is restored. As was said by my
honourable friend from Leeds (Hon. Mr.
Hardy), some fev men will be reinstated while
the war is on. But the real problem will come
after peace has been declared. I raise the
objection if my honourable friend from Ottawa
East (Hon. Mr. Coté) did not raise it-I
thought he did-that this legislation will then
Can we obtain the
be unconstitutional.
opinion of the Department of Justice on that
point? That is objection number one.
My' second objection is this. The principle
of the Bill is that every person who goes to
the war is entitled to reinstatement in his
former position, provided he had occupied it
for at least three months prior to enlistment.
Truc, there are certain exceptions in favour of
the employer. But let me give you some figures, which to my mind are very interesting
and raise a problem that the Bill does not
solve. One of our financial institutions bas

in the institution's employ prior to the war,
the other 227 having obtained their positions
since the war and served in them for more
than three months each. These are all men,
and to take their places the institution has
employed 1,556 women. It takes five women
to do the work of three men.
Hon. A. L. BEAUBIEN: That does net
necessarily follow.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: It is a large financial institution, which is net in business for philanthropic purposes. It would net take on fifteen
hundred employees uniles it needed them.
Hon. Mr. HARMER: The re must have been
an increase in business.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Oh, no, none at all. In
fact. they tell me the profits are down.
Hon. Mr. HARMER: That does not make
any difference.
lon. Mr. HAIG: I can quite understand why
we should have a Bill to guarantee re-employment to the 700 men who were employed with
the institution before war broke out. What
about the 227 other men? And what about
the 1,556 women?
Hon. Mr. COPP: They may be married
bv the time the war is over.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: That wias not the experiin1ce wtii wi-en emplovcs in the last war.

Hon. Mr. LEGER: The honourable gentleman's point is cov-ered by section 3 of the
Bill.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I know what the Bill
prov-ides; I read it several times and was at
every meeting of the committee. I am unable
to justify this Bill, because it is a false representation to these 227 men and others like
them. And we know that. I contend the
Bill is unfair to the returned soldier, and I
make the prediction, on my responsibility as
a senator from Manitoba, that it will net help
one per cent of our armed forces w-hen the war
is over. If you doubt what I say, read the
c u<eption- in ice Bill. I hoiuld like to be
acting for the employer rather than for the
employee in any action under this law. I
think that after the exceptions were pointed
out to the judge or magistrate a former
employee would have a hard time getting his
old job back. That is why I do net like the
Bill. I am in faveur of the principle that
a man whio volunteers for war service should
be reinstated in his former position when his
military service is ended, but I think we
shouldh luiit the Bill to what we know is
possible.

JULY 21, 1942
Then, what right have we to ask women to
go into such an institution as I have mentioned, or any other place of employment,
and work for one, two or three years or longer
and then be forcibly replaced? The Department of Defence suggests the war may last
four or five years yet. I submit we should
protect these women, if we intend to force
them out of their jobs when the war is over.
We have not faced that issue. A proportionately small number of the women will
marry; that was the history in the last war.
The Bill does not deal with this situation at
all. Therefore I think it is unsatisfactory,
and I urge that before next session it should
be reconstructed so as to cover the whole
problem. It is a desperate problem, one that
will become worse before the war is over, and
bills of this kind tend to make it worse still,
because they deal only with the fringe of the
question in failing to make any provision for
the people who will be thrown out of work
when peace is restored.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was
read the third time, and passed.
VOCATIONAL TRAINING CO-ORDINATION BILL
REPORT OF COMMITTEE

Hon. Mr. BLACK presented, and moved
concurrence in, the report of the Standing
Committee on Banking and Commerce on
Bill 64, an Act respecting the carrying on and
co-ordination of vocational training.
He said: Honourable senators, this Bill has
been considered and passed by the committee,
subject te certain minor amendments. The
Bill lias been before our committee on two
occasions and has been most thoroughly discussed. However, for the benefit of honourable senators who have not attended the
committee's meetings, I may say that, generally speaking, the Bill provides for aid by
the Federal Government, in co-operation with
the universities, for vocational training in
relation to the war, particularly with respect
to doctors, dentists, chemical scientists, and
engineers.

After the Assistant Clerk has read the
amendments I shall be glad to deal with any
questions which may arise on them.
Tle motion was agreed to.
THIRD READING

Hon. Mr. KING moved the third reading
of the Bill.
Hon. C. C. BALLANTYNE: Honourable
senators, as a number of members of this
Chamber are not members of our Standing

231

Committee on Banking and Commerce, I
intend to refer to certain observations that
I made this morning when the Bill was before
the committee. I shall do it as briefly as I
can. In principle I faveur this measure. I
question only the university project. If I
am inaccurate in any of the statements I
am about to make, I shall be very glad to
have the leader of the Goverpment set me
right.
As I understood the arguments placed before
the committee this morning, there exists
overseas and in Canada a great shortage of
medical men. I agree that this is so. It was
also stated that both in Canada and overseas
there was a shortage of engineers, chemists
and men of science. I understand that if
this Bill passes in its present form a student
who has attended any of our universities for
one year will be allowed to complete his
course, though it may take three or four
years more. I was under the impression that
it would be well not to insist on that point
with regard to engineers, chemists, scientists,
and so on. I asked: "How many students
would enroll in the various universities?" I
was told that the Government could not give
me an answer. I think it is fair to assume
there would be several thousands.
As every honourable member so well
knows, the war is now at a very critical
stage. I may be permitted to quote the
words spoken by Oliver Lyttleton when he
was addressing the British House of Commons a day or two ago. He said that the
war was at its most crucial stage since the
Battle of Britain in 1940, and that the next
eighty days would certainly be a testing time.
I think military experts are all agreed that
when this war is ultimately won it will be
won by our armies-a view that does not
imply any lack of appreciation of the magnificent achievements of the Allied naval and
air forces and the splendid services rendered
by the merchant marine. I do net think
anyone will seek to contradiet such a sane
statement.
That brings me to the crucial situation in
relation to our man-power. Possibly I did
not understand correctly the information
which the honourable leader of the Government furnished the committee, and I should
like him to inform the House very clearly
whether these students will, after they have
attended university for one year, be exempt
from military duty for the defence of Canada.
I asked him, "If the Government imposed
compulsory service for overseas would these
students come under such a call?" I think I
am correct in saying I was told no. If the
Government ever does introduce compulsory

232

SENATE

service, it will no doubt be selective, and I
should like to get a very clear and definite
statement from the leader of the Government
as te whether in such event these thousands
of young students, most of them of military
age and medically fit, will be exempt or not.
Fathers whose sons are not attending university will resent very much the calling of their
sons for military service while young men of
similar age and medically fit are exempt just
because they are attending university and
their services may be required in four or
fivc years from now. In England the authorities have been much more careful about
registration of man-power than we have been
in this country. There they are careful on
rEgistration to ask a man what vocation he
follows, and if they are satisfied with what
he is doing they order him to continue at his
work, or may move him to some position
where he can make a more effective war effort.
In the case of university students who show
great promise and: who require only one or
two more years to complete their course, the
British authorities say, "Continue and finish
your university training." As I understand this
Bill, such is not to be the system here. After
Young men have attended university for one
year their militarv service. either in Canada
or overseas, will be defirred until they have
completed their course.
As I said at the beginning of my remarks,
if I have misinterpreted what was discussed
this morning before the committee, or if I
have made any inaccurate statement, I should
be very glad to have the leader of the Govcrnment set nie right. I think it is due
Parliamoent and the people of Canada that the
Governmient should give a clear-cut statement as to whether these students. after one
year, are to be allowed to continue their
university courses until such time as they
arc graduated.
Hon. Mr. KING: Honourable senators, I
think we had sufficient evidence before our
committee to establish the fact that the
Department of National Defence has found
it necessary to enter into an arrangement
with the various universities in order that
there shall be a continuous supply of trained
medical men, dentists, engineers and scientists
to perform certain duîties which the department considers more essential than their enlistment at this time. It was pointed out that
enlisted men are being called back now in
order that the may qualify as practitioners
in medicine and dentistry. Similar action is
being taken in regard to engineers and
scientists. who are being given suitable opportunities to acquire practical training during
their vocational pcriod. I Io not think there
Hon. NIr. BALLANTYNE.

is any doubt that that phase of the Bill is
the result of a recommendation from the
Department of National Defence, and upon
its enactment the Minister will enter into an
arrangement with the universities to carry on
the cour-es described. The provincial governments and the Dominion Government are
financing the students. Ordinarily these young
men would go te work during the summer
to earn their tuition fees. It was pointed out
before the committee that after they are
qualified they will repay to the universities
certain sums of money so advanced, and these
funds will, in turn, be paid back to the
Government.
I do not think it is fair to suggest that
these men are being given an opportunity to
continue their university courses simply in
order to evade military service. That was
not the evidence from the department which
has to do with drafting these men. The
Minister supported the principle of the Bill
and said it was absolutely essential we should
have more doctors, net only in Canada but
overseas as well; and he spoke to the sane
effect in regard to scientists and engineers.
I think we may take it for granted from the
evidence adduced this morning that the
Department of National Defence and the
Department of National War Services consider this a very practical measure.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: But my bonourable friend bas not given an answer to the
most important question.
I bave asked
whether, if the Government did enforce compulsory service for overseas, these young men
xxho are now in the university would be
subject to call.
Hon. Mr. KING: Yes, they certainly would.
They are being drafted in just the same way
as others. but those who draft them may be
advised by the Department of National
Defence. "Don't take that man out of school;
]eave him there." In that event he will be
left there. But these boys are subject to
draft and exemption in just the same way as
any others.

there were two or three boys on a farm, only
one was exempted. I know the situation that
existed. It was only the man needed on the
farm who got exemption.
I did not intend, honourable senators, to say
as much as I have said. I am opposed to the
Bill. I know the House will pass it if the
Government needs it, but I wonder whether the
Government realizes how much trouble it is
laying up for itself. This legislation will be
bitterly resented the very day the Government
declares for conscription, and it will cause
so much trouble that honourable members will
wonder why they ever passed it.
If I may refer to a former debate-perhaps
it is out of order to do so-I would remind
the Senate that we on this side of the House
warned the Government that it should not
do certain things, and we stated what would
happen if it did. But the Government went
ahead, and what we had prophesied came true
and the warning was justified. The subjectmatter of this Bill will come up again and
again, and the bitter cry will be raised that
we as a Parliament deliberately granted
exemption to young men of education and
training-training at our expense-and that
they did not have to go to war.
Hon. J. A. CALDER: Honourable members,
the honourable senator frorn Winnipeg SouthCentre bas, I think, put his finger on the
difficulty that we as a legislative body meet
in connection with all such measures as this.
If Canada were in the same position as Great
Britain at the present tiie. we should have
none of these difficulties. The law of Great
Britain provides that all men and women. and
in sorne cases children, are liable to be called
for whatever service the Government may
require of them. Here in Canada we are a
long way fron any such condition. We have
a sort of muodified or contracted forn of conscription, but we have no conscription of all
our people. We shall always have difficulties
with this kind of legislation until we have
the condition that exists in the Old Country.
I am not going to debate the merits or demerits of this Bill at the present time, because
in my opinion it is based on a wrong foundation. Here we are at the very climax of the
greatest war in history. Every word we get
over the radio is to the effect that right at
this minute we are in extreme dangerSome Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: -and
yet we hear
people saying there is no need for Canada to
get into this war up to the hilt. I agree with
the honourable senator from Winnipeg SouthCentre that the time is coming, and coming

very quickly, when we must do everything
possible for our self-preserv ation. Already we
are late. To say there is as yet no need of an
all-out effort is absurd. Will there ever be a
time when the necessity is greater than now?
I am getting away from the Bill itself,-Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: -but I was simply
pointing out that until we reach the stage
when we have conscription, if you like-I do
not like the term-or the selective draft of
men and women for war services, so that we
may put them where they will be most useful,
we shall have difficulty with legislation of
this character.
The honourable senator fron Winnipeg
South-Centre has spoken of men being
exempted because they happen to bu attending the university.
Think of it!
Because
they happen to bu attending the university
men are put into a certain class and cannot
bu touched.
Hon. Mr. KING: They are subject to call.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: I am accepting the
honourable gentleman's statement that they
cannot bu called.
Hon. FELIX QUINN: Honourable senators,
I d'o not agree with the last two speakers. I
was at the meeting of the committee and heard
the argument pro and con regarding this Bill.
Although I was net a member of the conmittee, I offered an explanation with regard
to these students who are under discussion.
I told the committee, and Major-General
LaFlèche concurred, that every one of these
young men to whom I referred, students of
engineering and science, must-must, mind
you-join the Canadian Officers' Training
Corps when they begin their courses. I know
that to he a fact. Upon entering the Canadian Officers' Training Corps they become
part of the Canadian Army, and as such they
are liable to call at any time. So when my
honourable friends say these students are
exeumpted I cannot follow their argument.

Hon. Mr. QUINN: Why persist in sucb an
argument? I resent it, because it bits me
personally. I have a son who is finishing his
second year in engineering. He is no slacker.
He has offered to join the Army already,
before be finishes bis course, but, as I told
the committee, the President of the Nova
Scotia Technical College told the boys he
wanted them to finish their courses. He said

235

JULY 21, 1942

to tbem: "I am advised by the authorities at
Ottawa that you can perform a greater service
to y.our country by finishing your courses than
by joining the Army or any of the other services at the present time. But if an emergency anises at a.ny time, you can be called in
immediately." In such an event they can be
taken "right into the services-conscripted, if
you like-and placed wherever the Army,
Navy or Air Force needs them. That should
be made clear and understood by every honourable member, and it should not have to be
explained again.
Hon. SALTER A. HAYDEN: Honourable
senators, I agree entirely with what has just
been said by the honourable senator from
Bed'ford-Halifax (Hon. Mr. Quinn). May I
point out that the discussion so far has been
concerned principally with the agreements
made between the Government and the
universities. What we have before us is the
Bill empowering the Government to make
these agreements, and the general provision
governing this reads as follows:
The Minister may undertake projects to provide vocational training
(a) to fit persons for employment for any
purpose contributing to the efficient prosecution
of the war whether in industry or in the armed
forces.

Under that provision the authorities responsible for our armed forces-the Army, the
Navy and the Air Force-may decide that
it is in the best interests of Canada that the
young men who are taking engineering,
medical and dental courses at the various
universities should be kept at their studies.
And if they consider that to be so, I am not
prepared to express a contrary opinion. If
they think the national interest demands that
we assure ourselves of a continuity of supply
of engineers and other trained men, I submit
that, in war-time, we have to bow to their
judgment. Apparently that was the notion
which prevailed even in 1917, for I find by a
hasty perusal of the then Military Service
Act t.hat application for a certificate of exemption could be made on any of the various
grounds, including this one:
That it is expedient in the national interest
that, instead of being employed in military
service, hethat is, the applicant for exemptionshould continue to be educated or trained for
any work for which he is then being educated
or trained.
The language used in this Bill is not the
same as that, but I think the meaning in both
cases is the same.
These young men who are continuing their
special training at our universities are, if
44567--161

they come within the categories that have
been called up for service, members of the
Army, and in the event of conscription for
overseas service being put into effect they
can be sent overseas at any time, on the
order of the authorities at Ottawa charged
with administration of the military services.
Hon. Mr. QUINN:

Certainly.

Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: Some persons have to
exercise judgment, discretion and power in
this matter, and those charged with that duty
at Ottawa say that for the present the medical,
dental and engineering students at our universities are performing a service in the national
interest by continuing their education. If
the question is approached from that point of
view it will be seen, I think, that postponement of military service for these students
means, not that they are being granted a
special privilege. but simply that they are
required to continue their training and education so as to be better fitted to render service
as and when their country needs them.
Hon. Mr. COTE: Honourable senators, this
morning I expressed in committee my approval
of this Bill in so far as it relates to the
vocational training of persons in order to
enable them to serve better in the prosecution of the war, and to the training of exservice men. I have not changed my mind.
Frorn the explanations given us in committee
by a very able official of the Crown. MajorGeneral LaFlèche, I think the situation we
are trying to rectify, in part, has resulted from
the method adopted by this country in the
recruiting of men for military service overseas. We have relied on the voluntary system.
The choice as between the Army and other
occupations has been left to the individual.
It has been left to the judgment and conscience of every man of military age to decide
whether he should enlist for service abroad
or continue in his present position. In scores
of thousands of cases the patriotic fervour of
young men has moved them to join the
Active Forces. Incidentally, as Major-General
LaFlèche told our committee, this enlistment
has depleted the universities of their students
in medicine, engineering, science and chemistry. It has even depleted the professions.
When we consider the demands of Canada for
scientifically trained men, we can readily
accept the evidence given this morning that
we have now reached a point where we are
exceedingly short of doctors, dentists, engincers and chemists, and that something must
be done to rectify. to some extent, what is
a result of the voluntary enlistment of men
in these classes.

1 th.ink ýthat anyone who has scrutinized this
Bill and lias heard the expianations given by

resist the conclusion that the Biii is a bona

rectify and equailize the existing situation.
For that reason I do flot agree with the
criticismn that has been made 'of the Bill. To
my miod it is a useful and necessary measure.
After ail, it is easy to argue that if we
had had compulsory selective service from. the
beginning of the war we should flot be
faced with the situation that faces us to-day.
But this is no't the time to discuss whether
or net we shouid have had a different
system. I have my own views, but for the
purpose of this Bill I -must take the situation
as it is. It is a situation of shortage in ail
those professions-medical, dental, engineering
and chemicai-for whiceh young men are being
encouraged and assisted to continue their
training and become quaiified as early as
possible. Some wili finish their studies next
ycar, but others wiii require two or three
years longer. I for one should nlot like themn

TAFFERT AND ZWINGEL DIVORCE
CASES
REPORTS 0F COMMITTEE

Hon. W. M. ASELTINE presented the
eightieth and eighty-first reports of the Standing Committee on Divorce, with respect to
the petitions of William Taffert and Vincent
Zwingel, respective]y.
H1e said: Honourable senators, with respect
to the committee's report on the petition of
William Taffert, I wish to state that this case
was very carefully considered by the coinmittee, and after the evidence was transcribed
it was read by every member. A final decision
was given yesterday, this being unanimpus,
except that one member dissented.
The eighty-first report deals with the petition of Vincent Zwin'gel. The committee
recornmends that this petition be refused.
Hon. JAMES MURDOCK: Honourable
senators, I should like to get a little information. The Acting, Cliairman of the Divorce
Committee stated a few minutes ago that the

237

report Of the committee on the Taffert case
was unanimous, with one exception. As a
matter of fact, the voting wasthree to one.
I arn the one dissenting. My judgment is
that an absolute crime is heing committed
against a virtuous and honest woman and
hier sixteen-year-old daughter. I notice the
rule provides that a minority may bring in
a report stating the grounds upon which they
dissent from the report. I have neyer heard
of a minority report having heen submitted,
and I am n ot clear as to when it should be
brought in, and how. I want to comply with
the rules. I want to oppose in any way I
can this crucifixion of a virtuous woman by
a man who on his own sworn testimony is
admittedly a rotter. I arn seeking advice as
to .iust how I arn to proceed. When shall I
bring in my minority report?
An Hon. SENATOR:
An Hon. SENATOR:

Neyer.
Now.

Hon. A. B. COPP: I think that my hionourable friend, hefore submitting his minority
report, should withdraw the statement that
the other members of the committee have
comrnitted a "crime."
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: I should have said,
and I now say, that I think a crime would be
committed against a virtuous and honest
woman if this divorce were granted on the
ground of hier immorality, which I do flot
believe exists.
Hon. Mr. COPP: In so far as the comnmittee is concerned, the recommendation for
granting a divorce lias been made, and the use
of the word "crime" implies that we other
members of the committee committed a
crime in bringing in our report. I think the
terni should he withdrawn.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Well, we will do
whatever the gentleman with his touchy
conscience thinks we should do. I will withdraw thatHon. Mr. COPP: Thank you.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: -and say, I think
it would be unfortunate, unfair and almost
criminal.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: I think the hionourable gentleman should also withdraw the
words "touchy conscience."

Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: That is not a withdrawal.
Hon. Mr. COPP: I would also say to my
honourable friend that he is entirely Out of

Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: But I am asking
for advice, for the rules of the Senate say the

report of the committee.
friend the Acting Chairman of the committee
said the vote was unanimous except for one
member. The fact is that the vote was three
to one. I tlink that if the Chairman of the
committee had been here-I may be mistaken-he would have been with me. The
case was heard on the 17th of March, and
it was decided yesterday, on the 21st of
July. All I want to know is what to do
and when to do it.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: The question is
whether this report shall he accepted.
Hon. Mr. COPP: Honourable members, the
honourable gentleman who has just sat down
(Hon. Mr. Murdock) says that he is going to
bring in a minority report, and he is asking the
Sonate, or some member of the Sonate, I
assume, how it is to be done. I do net think
lie is entitled to ask the Senate to give that
He is entitled to bring in a
information.
minority report if he so desires.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: When?
Hon. Mr. COPP: Whenever the honourable
gentleman chooses.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: On the first or second
reading. In view of the fact that the committee has disbanded for the session, I do
not think we have any right to go into this
matter.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Aha! I thought that
was what was going to be pulled when the case
was kept pending from the 17th of March to
the 21st of July. I thought that would be the
argument.
But a minority report will be
made just the same.
Hon Mr. KING: I ajn net an authority on
the rules of the House, but it seems to me
that if the honourable gentleman is really
serious, and asks for delay on this question, he
should be given time to prepare his report.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK.

Hon. Mr. CALDER: I would suggest that
the honourable member consult the Clerk of
the Sonate and the Law Clerk as to the proper
procedure to enable him to get his report
before the House.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: I have never heard
of a similar case before.
Hon. Mr. COPP: I have.
Hon. Mr MURDOCK: Have yeu?

Good!

Hon Mr. ASELTINE: I would move that
consideration of the eightieth report be deferred
until the next sitting of the House, and that
the eighty-first report be adopted.
The motion was agreed to.

PRIVATE BILL
IIEFUND OF FEES

Hon. Mr. HAIG moved that the parliamentary fecs paid upon Bill B4, an Act to incorporate the Felician Sisters of Winnipt'g, be
refunded to Messrs. Morkin & Monk, Winnipeg, Manitoba, solicitors for the petitioners,
less printing and translation costs.
He said: Honourable senators will recah
that the object of this Bill, which was read
the third time yesterday, is to incorporate a
charitable organization.
Hon. Mr. HARDY: Will the honourable
senator explain the reason for his motion?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: The incorporation is for
charitable purposes only. It is a hospital at
Grandview, Manitoba, organized and being
run by the Felician Sisters of Winnipeg.
Hon. Mr. HARDY: Is that the general
practice, to refund the fees in such cases?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Yes, always.
Hon. Mr. KING: I think it is the custon
to refund the parliamentary fees in these
cases.
The motion was agreed to.
ARTICLE IN "TIME" MAGAZINE
QUESTION OF PRIVILEGE

On the Orders of the Day:
Hon. J. W. deB. FARRIS: Honourable
senators, before the Orders of the Day are
called I rise to direct your attention to an
article in a magazine called "Time," which
cornes out of Chicago and circulates freely in

JULY 22, 1942
Just why it should have
this country.
circulation here I do not know. No doubt

it is because it comes from a country long
our friend and now our ally in the war. In
the issue of July 20 this magazine purports to
give a review of news from Canada, and with
the aid of amateurish doggerel alleged to be

a paraphrase of the Twenty-Third Psalm it
debases its page with an attack on the Prime
Minister of Canada. I call attention to this
article to record publicly a protest. I do so
for several reasons.
First: It is an abuse of neighbourly tolerance
for a publication in the United States to
circulate a scandalous diatribe against the
head 'of the Government of its most friendly
neighbour.
Second: The assertion in the magazine that
this rubbish is going the rounds in Canadafor that is what the article says-is a false
reflection on our discrimination and sense of
the fitness of things. This so-called paraphrase may be good enough for the columns
of "Time," but any rounds it makes in Canada
must be in disreputable quarters where its
anonymous
author fraternizes
with
the
anonymous "Time" reporter. Perhaps they
are one, or perhaps they "did time" together.
Third: To call such trash a paraphrase of

the Twenty-Third Psalm is absurd. Coming
from any intelligent quarter, it is sacrilegious.
No doubt the uninformed editor of "Time"
did not know the difference in meaning
between a paraphrase and a parody. In any
event, honourable senators, this doggerel in
itself is cheap. It is in poor taste, and it is
an insult to intelligent readers wherever the

magazine circulates.
Fourth:

Limited to

tioned, one might

the objections men-

ignore the incident as

trivial, making allowances for the smart Aleck

kind of writing this paper affects. It is,Hon. Mr. COTE: Pardon me. Will the
honourable gentleman read the article?
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: No, I will not do that,
sir. If anybody wishes to read it, I will not
be a party to putting it on the pages of the

proceedings of this House.
Hon. Mr. HARDY:

Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. COTE: But what is the honourable member speaking to? A matter of privilege, is it?
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: I am speaking to a
matter of privilege of this House.
Hon. Mr. COTE: It is with regard to an
article that we have not seen.

239

Hon. Mr. FARRIS: I say there is, however, a more serious complaint, with regard to
the reference in the article to the conscription
debate in the House of Commons. This part
I intend to read.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Honourable senators,
it seems to me that the honourable gentleman
from Vancouver South (Hon. Mr. Farris) must
be out of order. What is he speaking to? Has
any honourable member of this House the right
to rise at any time and ask about a matter of
this kind or any other kind that he chooses to
select? He will not even read the article to us.
Is he asking us to form a judgment?
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: I have given the reference to the article in this magazine, and I may
say to my honourable friendHon. Mr. CALDER: Pardon me. I am
rising to a point of order, which I want to
make quite clear. I want to know what
right an honourable gentleman has to refer
to a document that he will not quote. He
will not read it. He will not furnish us with
the means of forming our judgment as to
whether there is any justification for the statements he is making. It seems to me he
should not proceed along this line.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: Mr. Speaker, I may
say that when I decided to make this complaint in the Senate I consulted the honourable leader of the Government (Hon. Mr.
King) and the honourable leader opposite
(Hon. Mr. Ballantyne), and had assurance
fron them both that this was a matter about
which a protest should be made. My objection to reading the article is only this: I do
not think honourable members of this HouseHon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: Pardon me a
moment. When the honourable senator spoke
to me about his proposed protest, I said I
did not have any objection. But I thought
he would read the article before he criticized
it.

Hon. Mr. FARRIS: I do not think honourable senators would wish to have a scurrilous
article of this kind, described as a paraphrase
of that great Psalm, the Twenty-Third Psalm,
placed- on Hansard.
Hon. Mr. CALDER:
The honourable
gentleman has criticized a paper in very strong
language, which will go out all over Canada,
but the people will not know what was written
in the article complained of. Not everybody
reade "Time." Is it fair, is it reasonable, that
he should make a statement of this kind
without laying the basis for it? I say not.
I would ask for a ruling of the Chair on that
point.

SENATE

Hon. Mr. FARRIS: May I say this, Mr.
Speaker?
I have the article here. I will

Hon. Mr. FARRIS:

Neither am I.

Hon. Mr. CALDER: But you are talking
to the people of Canada.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: We are representatives
of the people of Canada, and as one of the
representatives of the people I am stating
in this House that there is circulating throughout the country an article which I think is
not fit and proper literature to be so circulated.
I will hand my honourable friend a copy. If
after reading it be thinks it proper, and if
he feels that, in refutation of what I am saying, it should be recorded on the pages of
Hansard, there will be plenty of opportunity
to have this done. But personally I prefer
that it should not be done.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: I doubt if that
practice would be advisable in this House.
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: Honourable senators,
if my honourable friend from Vancouver
South <Hon. Mr. Farris) will excuse me for a
moment, I should like, just in the interest
of consistency, to remind my honourable friend
from Salteoats (Hon. Mr. Calder), and any
other honourable member who is objecting, of
the exception that was taken by the right
honourable the former leader of the other
side of the House (Right Hon. Mr. Meighen)
to what many regarded as a very harmless
story in the Saturday Evening Post.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: He quoted from it.
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: He did not read
the whole story, nor did he attempt to. He
castigated the Saturday Evening Post, the
author and the title of the story, so much so
that bis statement prompted a most fitting
reply from my colleague the honourable
senator from Inkerman (Hon. Mr. Hugessen).
I would suggest that some measure of consistency be adopted.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: I am speaking on my
point of order. I well remember the criticism
that the former leader on this side of the
House made of the Saturday Evening Post
article. I was sitting right here next to him.
He criticized the magazine, not on one
occasion onlv. but on several occasions. But
ho quoted what was said in the magazine.
Some Hon. SENATORS: No. no.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: I beg your pardon.
Hon. Nr. CALDER.

CALDER: But in addition to

Not until he had

Hon. Mr. FARRIS: I was about to quote
a portion of this article when my honourable
friend from Saltcoats (Hon. Mr. Calder) interrupted me. I say. so far as the alleged paraphrase of the Twenty-Third Psalm is concerned, I decline to quote that, but I had
just reached the point in my statement where
I was about to quote from other parts of
the article when my honourable friend took
objection.
Hon. Mr. CALDER:

Oh, well, go on.

Hon. Mr. HAIG: Honourable senators.
according to the rule, the honourable gentleman cannot proceed with his criticism of any
article unless he reads that article.
Some Hon. SENATORS: No, no.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: That is the rule. True,
as the honourable senator from Inkerman
(Hon. Mr. Hugessen) has said, w'hen the
former leader on this side dealt with the
Saturday Evening Post article he did not
read from it until he was challenged. He
then read certain portions of it, but he could
have been compelled to read the whole article.
Some Hon. SENATORS:

No.

Hon. Mr. HAIG: So long as no one objected
to the way he was proceeding, no. I might
be proceeding contrary to rule on a certain
occasion, let us say. If no one objected, I
should continue as I was going, but the
moment anyone raised an objection I should
have to comply with the rules.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: What is the number
of the rule referred to by the honourable
gentleman? I have the book here.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: You will find the rule in
the book.
I do not blame the honourable senator from
Vancouver South (Hon. Mr. Farris) for not
rcading the article. I would not read it either.

241

JULY 22, 1942
To be quite candid, I did not like the article
at ail. I amrn ot sure, however, that bringing
it up here is doing any good. On the contrary, 1 arn afraid this will advertise the
article very widely.
On the point of order, Mr. Speaker, I submit this. If honourable members on this side
insist that the article should be read-I feel
we ought flot to do so-if honourable members do insist, I think they are within their
rights. It is no answer for the bonourable
senator from Ottawa (Hon. Mr. Lambert) to
say that someone once got away with criticizing an article that he did not read. We
may break the rules as often as we lie,
provided ne one objects; but tbe minute

anyone objects, we rnust comply with the
rules. I submit te you, Sir, that the rule
requires the reading of any article criticized
in this Bouse.
Some Hon. SENATORS: No.

Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Let me read the
rule.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: The honourable senator
can bave his say afterwards. He is likely te
have it, anyway.
According te the rule, the part of any article
that is objected to must be read. But I would
ask honourable members on both sides of the
House not to insist that the rule be adbered
to in this case. I think we should allow tbe
honourable senator from Vancouver South
(Hon. Mr. Farris) to proceed witb his statement without being required te read tbe
article he is criticizing.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Rulc 42 reads:
Any senator complaining to the Senate of a
statement in a newspaper as a breach of privilege, shail produce a Popy of the paper containing the statement in question.
"Produce a copy of the paper containing tbe
statement in question."
Some Hon. SENATORS: Produce.
Hon. Mr. COPP: Lay it on the Table if you
want te.

Hon. Mr. FARRLS: Honourable senators,
the paper in question is "Time," the date
July 20, the page 30, thc title "Canada."
I gather it is the wish of thc House that I
proceed.
Henourable senators will recaîl that at the
point of interruption I was stating the resens
for my protest. To preserve the context I will
repeat the feurth reason.
Fourth: Limited te the objections mentioncd, one might ignore the incident as trivial,
making allowances for the smart Aleck kind of
writing this paper affects. There is, howcver,

a more serieus complaint. The article, referring
te the conscription debate in the Bouse of
Commons, says:

In the 126 conscription speeches in Parlia-

meut since June 10 net one M.P. mentioned that

590 Quebec municipalities were reperted te bave

signe(l a pledge neyer te accept overseas conscription under any circumstances.
Se far as that purports te give news from
Canada, I think the statement may be properly
descrihed as a lie shamelessly fabricated.
Circulated in Canada, it may do some barma,
but net much. Circulated in the United States,
the whole article is obviously intended te
intensify the belief, alrendy fostered in that
country by fifth-column propaganda, that there
is something wrong witb Canada's war effort.
Many Canadians are critical of their Gevernment.* Many Canadians feel that our war effort
should be even greater than it is. Bu~t we are
all a unit in our pride in what we have done
and we know that, measurcd by any test, it
will compare favourably with the effort of our
neighbours. We are a unit in resenting prepaganda circulated te belittle our effort and intended te cause friction. The vicious-minded
individual who sends such stuff from Canada
should be fcrreted eut by tIc authorities. He
will bear watcbing. As ta tIe magazine, any
editor with a sense of responsibility should
know that stories like this about a neigîbouring country and its Government are mischieveus and ought net te be permitted.
Fifth: This is net an isolated offence. For
a considerable period items in "Time" covering Canadian news have heen unfair, inaccurate and entirely eut of perspective. My cernplaint is directed in particular te recent mentIs
since the United States bas been a belligerent
and our associate in fightîng a common enemy.
The items of Canadian news, se -called, appearing in this magazine have net truly
reflected Canadian affairs or Canada's effort
in the war. On tIe centrary, trifling events
have been magnificd eut of their sctting and
reports have been designed te give a false and
misleading impression calculated te belittle
Canada's war activities and te bring discredit
on her Govcrnment.
The article 1 have
breught te your attention to-day is only tee
characteristie of a consistent policy promptcd
hy a malice I cannot understand.

The fricndly relation between this country
and the United States to-day is one of the

brightest spots in this saddened world.

We

arc more tlan allies; we are friends and good
neigîbours. Anything which tends te disturb
this relation is a crime, and anyone a party
thereto is a major offender.
Some Hon. SENATORS:

Hear, hear.

SENATE

non. A. D. McRAE: Honourable senators,
the point of order bas received a great deal
of discsion. I know I am out of orderSome Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. McRAE: -in getting up to make
some observations on the incident which the
honourable senator (Hon. Mr. Farris) has
just called to our attention. But, with your
permission, bonourable senators, I wish to
occupy a few minutes of your time in order
to comiient on this situation. As I hear no
objections, I take it that you grant me this
privilege. I thank you.
J an sure we ail sbare the honourable
senator's regret that incidents of this kind
bave occurred. Those of us who have the
opportunity know that our standing for what
we bave so far donc in the war is being
gradually lowered with the American people,
and of course articles like that te which the
honourable gentleman
bas referred only
hasten the downward trend.
The
honourable
gentleman
mentioned
"Time." wbich is publi-hed in New York.
I bave been an occasional reader of the
magazine, and I think tbose of you who
bave read it from time to time will agree
with mne that since the beginning of the war it
bas bcen a staunch supporter of Great Britain.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. McRAE: True, there have
occurred from time te time incidents that
were net so favourable. If my information
is correct. this paper maintains a staff of
representatives in various capitals throughout
the world-fewer, however, in Europe to-day,
and since Germany bas overrun se many
countries there. The management has maintained a staff to gather news, and I think that,
by and large. the news dispatches and comments of "Time" on Britain, Germany and
the othjer countries engaged in the war have
been very fair. I do not necessarily agree
al
vs witi "Tim," and tihat is one's attitude towards most publications; but, speaking
generally. "Time" bas been a consistent supporter of Great Britain and ber Allies, and
in many cases bas been very friendly te
Canada.
J should not like the pretty severe statement of the bonourable senator to pass
without some reference to the good work
whicb "Time" bas done for the Allied cause.
We should not expect every article to be
entirely pleasing to us. nor should we seriously
criticize its literary style. "Time" is written
in a way which is undoubtedly popular with
the rank and file, judging by its large circulation and its influence, which makes it ail the
more unfortunate that this incident should
have occurred.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS.

But, after ail, honourable members, are we
net just camouflaging a situation that we
know only too well? Dissatisfaction is rife
througlout every province of this Dominion
to-day. Yeu have net to visit them ail te
know it. I am speaking of what I have found
in journeying from Vancouver to Toronto
and to and from Montreal. Honourable
members from the Eastern Provinces know
their own situation.
The reason for that
feeling you are ail as familiar with as I am.
Anybody who comes into Canada will hear
much worse things said about our Prime
Miuister ilian those quoted from "Time." Is
it net obvious tbat any journal's representatixe coming to Canada will notice that
atmosphere?
Hon. Mr. KING: I think my honourable
friend is entirely out of order. His remarks
are likely to lead to a political discussion on
a matter that is not before the Senate.
Hon. Mr. McRAE: I know I am out of
order.
Hon. Mr. KING: I think you should desist.
Hon. Mr. MeRAE:
I an pretty nearly
throiigli with my remarks.
Hon. Mr. KING: I think you should desist.
There is a time for what the honourable
gentleman desires to say, but this is net the
time.
Hon. Mr. MeRAE: This is pertinent to the
discussion. I only ask that we be fair to ourselves and net be too critical of a publication
that bas been helpful to our cause. Let us net
be too critical of a magazine for publihing
what, te say the least, is occasioned by local
conditions.
Hon. Mr. COTE: Honourable membersHon. Mr. HARDY: Mr. Speaker, I rise to
a point of order. The question of privilege
raised by the honourable senator from Vancouver South (Hon. Mr. Farris) is net
debatable.
Hon. Mr. COTE: I do net wisb to debate
the question.
Hon. Mr. HARDY: I think the discussion
is entirely out of order.
Hon. Mr. COTE: I wish to give a word of
explanation.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Mr. Speaker, I rise
te a point of order.

The Hon. the SPEAKER: It seems to me

I had expected that to-morrow afternoon we

Hon. Mr. CALDER: No.
Hon. Mr. KING: We bad better go on for
the time being.
As one who was a member of the Provincial
Government of British Columbia when we
undertook to do certain work in connection
with the settiement of soldiers on the land
after tbe hast war, I may say that those who
had sorne responsibility at that time, in either
provincial or Dominion Government affairs,
do not look back with much satisfaction or
comfort upon the results of their efforts.
From our experience of those days, in both
the Dominion and provincial fields, much has
been hearned, and for the past year or more
the Dominion Governrnent has had interdepartmentah committees conferring together
and with outside advisers upon the problern

243

of reinstating our fighting men when they
return from service ini this war. It has been
decided by the Government that a new
measure should be adopted for the purpose
of settling upon the land men who indicate a
desire to go upon the land and who show an
adaptability for farrning and seem likely to
make a success of it. If honourable members
read the Bill before them an'd compare it
with the Soldier Settiement Act, they will
find that it contains certain characteristics
which were absent from that Act-characteristics which will remove any doubts they may
have as to the success of the administration
of the measure now before us.
Only yesterday we passed two bis designed
to assist in re-estecblishing men after their
return from the war. One of these was the
bill providing for reinstatement in civil cmployment; tihe other was the Vocational
Training Bill, which affords an opportunity
of taking vocational training and of later
being placed in industry. Since July, 1941,
we have had the Industrial Insurance Act,
under which a fund has been set up to assist
men from the time of their return frorn overseas until they can re-establish themselves in
civil if e. Other measures with similar purposes have been considered and passed by this
Parliamefit.
Last year a survey was made in regard to
the matter of land settiement, and of some
200,000 answers receivtjd from men who had
joined the forces, about 33,000 indicated that
the men desired upon their return to Canada
to establisb themselves upon the land. That
is about 16-6 per cent. The survey also
indicated that many of the men who expressed
a desire to, settie on the land were the sons'
of farmers, or were men who had come from
rural districts.
Only men who enlisted frorn Canada or
were resident in Canada before the war, and
who have had at least one year of service
in the armed forces, will be entitled to corne
under the provisions of the Bill. Under the
soldier settiement pohicy following the last
wetr, not only Canadian soldiers, but also
soldiers of the Allies were permitted to take
advantage of the opportunities offered. As a
result, many men from overseas came to this
country with their families. Many of tbern,
unfortunatehy, did flot know conditions in
Canada and were unsuccessful. 1 could give
a history of the failure under that Act, but
as the subject is not a very pleasant one, I
shaîl refrain frorn doing so. As I have said,
of the 33,000 men Who îndicated their desire
to settle upon the land the maj ority were
farmers' sons or came from rural districts.
That is a very good basis upon which to

SENATE
work. These men are under no illusions at
all. They have been brought up in farming
communities and would like to return to the
occupation in which they were engaged before
they joined the forces.
After the last war we advanced money for
home building. In British Columbia, with
which I am familiar, the Provincial Government undertook the administration and the
collection of revenues. I am informed that
the experiment was very successful. Many
men who entered into the arrangement secured
homes, which they paid for, and in which they
are living to-day. It will be observed that
under this enactment provision is made whereby a man may secure a plot of land adjacent
to a community where industrial employment
is available. In other words, he may establish
a home in a place where he will not be
entirely dependent upon his earnings from
farming operations, but can augment his income
by working in some industry.
Another provision in this Bill has to do
with fishermen. It bas been ascertained that
many young men serving in the Navy come
from points on the Atlantic or the Pacifie sea
coast, or along the St. Lawrence, and that
prior to entering the service they were engaged
in the occupation of fishing. Under this enactment those young men can secure homes in
localities where they will be able to carry on
their previous occupation, and they will be
assisted in securing the necessary equipment,
such as tackle, boats, and so on.
Those are the main features of the Bill. I
shall just briefly indicate what is contained in
other sections of the Bill as it will corne before
us in committee. The measure will be administered by a Director, who will be responsible to the Minister of Mines and Resources.
It will be remembered that the Soldier Settlement Act was administered by a board of
directors. Experience proved that that was
not the best form of administration, and later
the administration was placed in the hands of
a Director.
I have spoken of the eligibility of men to
secure assistance under this measure.
An
amendment was made whereby the term
" eteran" shall include a British subject who
was ordinarily domiciled or resident in Canada
at the beginning of the war, and who is in
receipt of a pension in respect of a disability
ncurred while serving upon a ship during the
said war. Under this plan sailors along the
sea coast will have an opportunity to reestablish themselves.
On turning now to sections 3, 4, 5, 7 and 8,
it will be observed that there are general conditions relating to the Director and the
emplovees, and to the corporate powers of
lon. MIr. RING.

the Director. The Director will have authority
to buy or acquire land or other farm property.
This property will be vested in him as a corporation sole, and shall be subject to taxation
in the ordinary way by any duly constituted
taxing authority. I think honourable members
will agree that this is a proper provision. They
will remember that there was much confusion
and grief under the Soldier Settlement Act
because of the uncertainty as to whether
soldier settlement lands were taxable or not.
Under this measure the issue is squarely met
at the outset, and the Director, as a corporation sole, is liable for taxation on the lands
held by him.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: If the taxes are not paid,
will the municipalities have a right to get title
by means of the usual proceedings?
Hon. Mr. KING: No. The Director must
protect the property. That will appear as
you read the measure.
It is provided that the Director may purchase suitable land, and that the ceiling or
the maximum cost he may incur for any
individual property shall be 84,800, which is
made up of 83,600 for the land, buildings and
improvements. and $1.200 for equipment and,
stock. If the cost of the land, etc., is tlie
maximum, $3,600, the returned soldier settlier
must pay down ten per cent of the $3,600
when he enters into the contract, and nust
agree to pay, over a period of twenty-five
years, the sum of $2,400, which is two-thirds
of the sale price of the land.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: I understand
that the ceiling is $4,800.
Hon. Mr. KING: Yes. Three thousand six
huîndred dollars will be expended for land
and buildings only.
In section 9 you will find the conditions of
the sale te the settler. The sale price to himu
of the complete enterprise, including live
stock and fari cquipment, shall be two-thirds
of lthe cost, to the Director, of the land.

While it is. provided that the Director shall
not incur costs in excess of 34,800 upon any

JULY 22, 1942
single property, there is nothing to debar a
veteran from undertaking a larger venture if
out of bis own resources be is able to put up
the additional amount of money required. It
is understood that the veteran shall fot
encumber the land with mortgages or other
charges. Rie will be under the control of the
Director and will flot be permitted to
embarrass himself by incurring otber debts.
The titie to live stock will remain within
the Director's control, but opportunity will
he provided for the veteran to dispose of his
berd and to reap any profit obtainable from
this source. The original stock must flot be
depreciated, however.
Should occasion arise wben tbe veteran
needs a loan in order to extend bis property,
he will not be permittcd to borrow until he
has proved to the Director that hie is
financially capable of taking care of the
loan.
The veteran must insure bis property. He
must pay ail taxes and assessments, and
should bie be unable to do this the Director

is rcquired to proteot the dlaims. In another
place an amendment was moved limiting the
Director's control in the selection of advisers
in the matter of disputes or liquidation. As
I understand it, the Director will make bis
recommendation to the Minister, upon wbom
will rest the responsibility of the decision.
Provision is made for disposition of the
property in the event that througb illness or
unforeseen circumstances the veteran is unable
to continue on the land. Any surplus after
the sale will be paid to the soldier; and under
certain conditions the down-payment may be

refunded to hlm. If after he bas been on
the land four or five years a veteran finds
hie cannot succeed, because of unadaptability

to farming, hie will be allowed to get out and
his property will be taken over by the
Director.
It is probable that
scheme adopted after the last

under

the

war much
hardâhip occurred becauce men were induced,
by the granting from, time to time of goverfimental concessions in the way of reduction of
interest and of capital charge, to remain on
fa=rn under impossible conditions. In such

cases it would have been better if they had
been permitted to leave the land as soon as it
was reason'ably clear that they could flot make
a success of farming, and 'before they had
become too old to find suitable employment
elsewhere. It is hoped that unfortunate mistakes in this connection will be generally
avoided under the present plan.
Section 35 provides that the Minister may
enter into agreements with the provinces for
the settlement of veterans on provincial
lands.

Since the last war the agricultural industry
bas benefited greatly from scientific developments with respect to soul chemistry. To-day
the prospective purchaser of a farm. may
apply to the provincial Department of Agriculture or to the nearest university and
obtain a great deal of knowledge that was
not available some years ago witb regard
to the characteristies of the land and the kind
of crops it will best produce. It is hoped
that in selecting lands under this measure
the Director and bis a.ssociates will avail
themselves of these facilities, in order that
properties on wbich veterans settle may be
suitable, as regards not only location, but
also fertility of soul.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: What size of
f arm is obtainable for $3,600?
Hon. Mr. KING: I do not know. That
varies. The ceiling for land and buildings is
$3,600; and for equipment, implements and
stock it is $1,200.
I think, bonourable senators, I need not
say more at this time. The Bill will be sent
to committee. I feel it is reasonable to hope
that ail who study the Bill, even those wbo at
first blush may feel we bave already had
enough to do with soldier settlement scbemes,
will find mucb menit in this one. Everybody
will agree, I think, that the agricultural
industry of this country should be able to
contribute very materially to the re-establisbment of our war veterans. It is to be
hoped that a large proportion of the men wbo
take advantage of this seheme will already
have had some experience at farming or fishing and will seniously desire to make a success
at their occupations after the war. And in
that event, the Bill should be of great benefit
to a large numiber of war veterans.
Hon, C. C. BALLANTYNE: Honourable
senators, I do not for one moment pose as an
authority on farming. 1 have some knowledge
of mixed farming in Eastern Ontario, but of
grain growing or Western farming in general
I know very little. We alI agree that everything possible should be done to assist in the
re-establishment of our fighting men when
they return to us. The bonourable leader
(Hon. Mr. King) bas mentioned the difficulties
encountered by the Union Government througb
the creation of a land settiement scheme for
veterans of the hast war. I agree that that
Government did meet with a great deal of
difficulty.
Hon. Mr. KING: That was true of provincial governments too.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: And I amn afraid
considerable grief is ahead for my honourable friend and the present Government in

SENATE
ronnection with the acharne now proposed.
My honourable friend states that soe 33.000
men in the forces have expressed their wiilingness to go on the land atter the war, and that
many of thein have already worked on farina
or lived i11 rural districts. I take it that
for the most part their experience bas been
in Eastern Canada. Farming in Eastern Canada
is totaily different frein farming on the
Prairies. Climatit conditions are not the samc'u.
The land is net the saine and cannot be
worksd in the samne manner. I do not knew
whcther the intention is that the settiement
untier this Bill is to be in the three Prairie
Provinces exciusiveiy, or in ail the provinces.
Hon. _Mr. KING: I thick the seheme is
to appiy generaliy, throughout Canada.
Hon. Mr. BALLÂNTYNE: May I suggest
te the honnurable leader that before veterans
are settied on land in any of our provinces
they eughit to be interviewed by a board whichi
bas a complote kcowledge of farmicg condinions., net oniy in the West, but also in the
East. I feel satisficd if that were done rnany
applicants xxho now appear eager anoughi te

JUILY 22, 1942
Hon. JOHN T. HAIG: Honourable senators, I did flot intend to speak to-day on this
Bill, as I understood it would flot be given
second reading until to-morrow.
I believe every-bodýy is desirous cf evolving
som1e scheine thst will afford aur returned muen
an opportunity to re-establish themselves in
civil lii e. Like the Government after the hast
war, this Government has decided to settie
soldiers on the land. Prior to the Soldier
Settiement Act the Government of Manitoba
undertook to lenti money te farmers actually
on the land, but it lost over haif the money
loaneti, in addition te the cost of management.
Notwithstanding this unsatisfactery experience,
the Provincial Government next again trieti te
help the farmers by loaning themn money to
buy chattels. The administration coat runs
from $27,000 te $30,000 a year, and at the end
of twenty years the provincial treasury will
net receive sufficient repayment of loans te
balance the cost of management. Faxm settiement or farm loan schemes are likely te be
even more disastrous as you go farther west,
because in Manitoba aur landi will produce
average crops more eften th-an land in the
other two Prairie Provinces.
I suggest te the honourable leader of the
Gevernment that the soldier settlement scheme
under the Act now in force failed for twe
basic reasons. First, the men themselves were

net experienced farmers.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: As there are ne farmers
in this House, I cannot be accused cf flattering
the farmers when I say there is ne business that
requires sounder jutigment and greater experience and tenacity than dees the business of

the man on a farm. He has te be there morning, neen and nigbt, and hie must love the
werk for tbe work's sake, not for any other

reasen.
I de net think it could be done under this
or any oCher scheme, but it would be well if
you ceuld limit the operation of this measure
te soldiers who came from the landi. At least
haîf the young men who have volunteered
came from farm homes where the parents
would be glati te get them back ta work the
farms. In many instances a father would be
enly tee pleased te turn over the farm te his
son. This would apply generally throughout
Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta. A gooti
proportion of the other half are men who
formerly worked on farms. It may be taken
for granteti that after two, three, four or five
years' service in the army, and aIl the excitements of soldier life, they weuld finti it
extremely duhl on a farm five miles from town.
Such was our experience with our returneti
men after the last war. At least haîf the

247

failures under the Soldier Settlement Act were
brought about by the saldier settlers net being
willing te stay on the land.
Let me give an illustration. In 1914 two
yeung fellows volunteered fer ambulance
service overscas. Although their duties teok
them up into the fighting line, they were
neyer hit. During their three years,' service they ae anti slept together andi were
devoteti ta each ather: they were pals. After
demobilization they landeti in Winnipcg. One
hati been an insurance agent in a small way,
the other hati been engageti in a printing
office. They were vigeraus men about twentysix or twenty-seven years olti. Each had
saved some meney, anti one had received a
legacy frem bis father's estate. They bought
a haîf-section ef pretty goati lanti east of
Winnipeg. Two years later I drew up an
agreement for dissolution of their partnership.
They were sa utterly tired af each ather that
they werc flot on speaking terms, and I hati
to put them into separate rooms in my office
Something
ta prevent their quarrelling.
similar happened in hundretis of cases.
This very month the premiers of Manitoba,
Saskatchewan anti Alberta were dewn here
asking your awn Gavernment, Mr. Leader, te
introduce legishation for compulaary adjustment of debts. Hall the farmers in those
three provinces say they cannot make farming
pay. With thase experienceti farmers applying, net by hundreds, but hy tens of thousands,
fer adjustment af their debts, how can we as
sensible business men expect this land settlement scheme ta succeeti? I submit it cannot
succeed. I am net a prephet ner the son
of a praphet, but I make bold ta state that
if we get back 50 per cent af aIl the money
wre pay eut, nat enly by way ai lean, but also
fer administratian expenses, we shaîl be doing
welh.* But, worse than that, farce af circumstances wihl, in three or four years, drive
thase men back ta our urban centres, discontenteti, disillusianeti anti bitter against those
whom they wilh then blame for thicir
misfartunes.
Let me tell yeu something that I heEeve
wilh prevent such a disaster. First. letý us
take the one or two hundreti million dollars
requireti ta finance this seheme anti use it for
making loans ta farmers te the extent. say.
of net more than 60 per cent of the appraiseti
value af their farms. If you get the Soldier
Settlement baartis te value land under this
mneasure on a hasis simihar ta that which bas;

different cities, towns and villages of this
country on a proper basis. 1 would suggest
]oans Up to 60 per cent of the value of the
bouses. Then those men who secure work
will gradually get back into their old
occupations.
Tben there is reforestation, which was dis<-usseil in our committee this morning. Money
could be 1)rofitably spent on work that men
(-an do undcr instruction.
1 amn strongly opposed to trying to put a
man on a piece of land, in the hope tbat he
wiîll succoed, wben our provincial governrnents
in the Prairie Provinces, and indeed in the
other provinces too, tell us that at tbe present
lex-el of prices for farm producte farmers cannot pay the debts they now owe on their land.
That is w-bat discourages me in considering
this proposed legisietion. I think this is a
folloxx-up of wvhat was said ycsterday in confEction with another bill. In effect, you will
be saying to the returned soldier: "Go farming; but you cannot make it a success."
In the Western Provinces, the fermers who
are successful are, with few exceptions, those
bandling big farms with mechanized equipment. Because of the scarcity and bigh. cost
of labour, rnecbanized farming bas taken a
niucb more forward position on the Prairies
than for many years. The bonourable ruemaber from North Saskatchewan (Hon. Mr.
Horner) is a better nîîtbnrity on this point
tban I am, but I venture to say that a farmer
w-orking a quarter-section w'ith borses cannot
raise wbeat et less than 90 cents a bushel;
wberes on a tbree-eection farm with mechan.zed equipment the cost is only baif that
figure. That is w-bat the small farmer is up
againfit. We are asked, "Wbat about mixed
farming?" Well, you cannot mix-farm. very
miuch in Saskatchewan, the nature of the
(limate and tbe distance to markets not permitting it. It ie possible in Manitoba and in
certain parts of Alberta.
The Bennett Government in 1931 passed
thie farmers' debt adjustment legislation.
Later it w-as repealed as to aIl provinces but
Saskatcbewan and Alberta. Now Manitoba
is asking to bave tbe Act apply again to its
farmers. The premiers of tboso tbree provines w-ant the legisiation brougbt up to date.
When our experienced fermere cannot make
farîning pay, how can w-e expect inexperienccd men to succeed on second-class land
witb inadequate equipment? For $1,200 will
not buy much farma machinery; and you cannot in Manitoba, Saskatchewan or Alberta
buv first-elass farm land, with buildings, for
8S3,600.
Hon. Mr. HORNER: Oh, yes.
H on.

NI,-. 11IALO.

Hon. Mr. HAIG: Oh, no. You rnay be able
to do so eround Blaine Lake, buti I arn
talking about farm land around Indien Head,
Regina, Winnipeg, Portage la Prairie, and in
tbe Red River district. I do not know wbat
f ams can be bought for in Ontario, but I
tbink similar conditions prevail.
Surely a
farm in Ontario with ample equipment must
represent an investment of mucb more than
$3,600.
Maybe you can buy smell farms
there. But, again, 1 wonder wbether our boys
will want to go back on tbe land under those
conditions. Do you tbink tbey will be et att
eager to do so after being used to the bright
ligbte of our industriel cities and earning as
much as $6 to $8 a day? 1 do not tbink so.
We bave to face tbat situation.
I amn opposed to this Bill in every respect,
for I helieve its underlying principle is fundamentally wrong, and therefore I arn convinced
it will be a feilure.
We bave been told there will be no commission paid to anybody on the purchase of
land under tbe Bill. It is common knowledge
that if you want a farm you get into touch
with. a real estate man who liste farm lande.
XVe will call bim Mr. Jones. Youi tell bim
you want to buy a farm. witb buildings on it.
He informe you ho bas a list of twenty or
thiî-ty properties, and he aeks you to look
them over. He says, "We want $5,000 for
that baîf-section."
You say, "I will think
about it," and you get a fermer friend to go
witb you to look et it. Thsen you offer
$4,500 for it, and the dealer negotiates for you.
In thiat way you cen make e better bargein
than if you liad been dealing witb the owner,

because I find it is the most ecenomical
metbod for both parties concerned. What
the Goverament has in mind, no doubt, is
the fact that under the previous legisiation
frauds were committed on the Government
by certain persons who bought tracts of land
cheap and sold them at exorbitant prices.
So far as this legisiation prevents ail that
sort of thing, it is aIl to the good; but I
stili think it would be better to permit the
payrnent of commission, because otherwise
you will not get the hast service and the
widest choice.
The location of the land is important. The
Dean of the University of Saskatchewan said
about two years ago that the average rainfaîl
in bis province was about twenty-four inches
a yaar, and that if ramn faîl at the right time
there was a good crop. That would ha very
important to me if I were a farmer who bad
been brought up in the northern parts of
Saskatchewan, wbere dry farming is carried
on very successfully. There must be a certain
kind cf farming to suit particular conditions.
That is sornething which the agent bas in
mmnd. In trying to avoid one evii yeu are
creating another that is worse. This, I suggest,
is something that the Government should
consider.
I think we are going at this tbing in the

boans in Manitoba, Saskatchewan end Alberta,
and Dominion Govarnment farm boans in one
form or another, have ail been, without
exception, failures. The eniy loans with
regard to which there was any degree of
success were the ones made on buildings in
cities. That type of lending was d-one in
Winnipeg, and it was a' success because the
purchaser had to pay so much a month and
returns *were not dependent upon one crop
a year. Here you 'are dependling on one crop,
and on the success of a business that is difficuit at any tirne.
I arn persuaded that the only man who can
su*cceed on a farm is one who has been brought
up on the farm or who has gone out and
learned farming for himself. I think the
scheme will be a failure.
Hon. R. B. HORNER: Honourable senaters,

setting himself up as the representative of the
greatest agricultural province in the Dominion
of Canada.

Hon. Mr. HORNER: I should like te ask
the honourable senater from Winnipeg SouthCentre how, after the war is over, any Government is going to continue to build houses in
Winnipeg or anywhere else. Wh'at are the
men who live in thern going to work at? Are
they to go on relief in the city o! Winnipeg?
Soine Bon. SENATORS: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. HORNER: It is not many years
since I met in Montreal a gentleman who had
lent money on what had been described as
"iperfectly safe" property in the city of Winnipeg. He said: "What arn I going to do? The
taxes on my property in Winnipeg are greater
than the revenue I get from it, and if I cannot
find money to pay those taxes the city is
going to take my property." I said, "You
would be safer to have your money invested
in f arm lands."
Spaýaking of the price of land, I agree with
the honourable leader on this side of the
House (Hon. Mr. Ballantyne) that the Govarnment will have te reverse its position on
the cost of land and the cost of implements.
The figure for the land should be $1,200, and
for the implements $3,600. You cannot work

JULY 22, 1942
practical experience in dealing with farm
settlement in Western Canada in the past. I
feel we must divorce our minds entirely from
the experiences of the last post-war period, if
we are to get a proper view of the problems
likely to confront this country in the indefinite
future.
As we all know, there are with respect to
the future two broad points of view, encouraged
and stimulated by experience in the war
itself. There are those persons who, because
of Canada's present performance in all fields
of production, believe that the standard of
living established in these years will continue
and that there should be abundance and a
full life for everybody. But in more practicalminded quarters-I was going to say, less
idealistic quarters-the view is held that
nothing can possibly prevent a very serious
decline in the standard of living in this country
and throughout the whole world when the
time comes for taking stock of the devastation of this war and making the readjustments
that will have to be made if we are going
to continue any sort of civilized relationships.
Personally I am rather inclined-at this
stage, at any rate-to agree with the latter
point of view. And if this view should prove
to be correct, then I think the attitude
towards farm settlement plans, such as those
provided for in this Bill, will be very different from that which would be adopted by
what we might call economic planners, a group
of people who look forward to the maintenance, by some miraculous arrangement of
economics, of a standard of living equal
to or even better than that which we are
now enjoying. It is quite possible that a
great many people, including not only some
who have taken an active part in the war,
but numbers who have worked in factories
in this country, will be willing to engage in
farming on a subsistence basis. And while it
is impossible for any of us to blue-print the
conditions that will obtain in this country
after the war, I think it is well that the
Federal Government should prepare itself to
meet problems of a very profound economic
and social character by planning for the
settlement on land of men who know something about farming and those who are at
least desirous of supplying themselves with
food and shelter without being a charge on
the public treasury.
After all, we know very well that the experiment of maintaining unemployed people had
not reached its logical conclusion when it was
interfered with by the war. No doubt most
of us, in trying to form some kind of picture
of post-war conditions, think of the mass
unemployment, the idleness and shiftlessness,
the dole and all the other demoralizing factors

251

which we saw all about us in the years preceding the outbreak of war; and I believe that
everything which can be done now conscientiously to prepare for some protection against
that condition should be undertaken.
This Bill, to my mind, bas a good many
features that will have to be tried out. I
think a great improvement over the farm
settlement plan of the last post-war period
is seen in the provision for inspection and
supervision. As my honourable friend from
Winnipeg South-Centre (Hon. Mr. Haig)
knows very well, the adoption of a similar
policy by loan companies in the West has
resulted in some outstanding examples of
successful farm management. The principle
of supervision and intelligent direction is
sound and has worked out satisfactorily, not
only in fields of private investment, but also
in the provinces where agricultural agents have
shown what can be done to improve the
economic status of farmers.
The degree to which some 35,000 soldiers
will be absorbed on the land after the war
is over is to my mind an insignificant consideration at this time compared with the
thought that the Government of Canada is
conscientiously endeavouring to lay the foundation for meeting an unknown problem of
reconstruction and rehabilitation in the postwar period. To indicate some of the difficulties and the vagueness and uncertainty connected with that future picture, may I
suggest that the whole agricultural economy
of Canada has been in process of change
within the last three years. Because of the
disruption of international lines of trade
which have ordinarily taken care of our
agricultural surpluses and been the economic
mainstay of farming in this country, the prospect for our future agricultural economy is
wrapped up in the lap of the gods with the
outcome of this war. In this country we have
been taught to regard the British market as
our chief outlet for farm produce, but after
the war we may have to make an entirely new
orientation in this respect. So economie factors underlying the farm picture of the future
are such that no one can say just what the
general foundations for any scheme of land
settlement may be, or the economy that may
accompany the industry as a whole.
I know that much thought and consideration
are being given to these different phases of
reconstruction. In many quarters a hesitancy to discuss problems of post-war
reconstruction exists on the ground that
psychologically it does not help the war effort.
In some quarters the suggestion bas been
made that these problems might better be
defined as post-war objectives. Possibly that

SENATE
is so. At any rate, I know that the committees and subcommittees of earnest-minded
people who are already giving attention to
these matters haive publicly discussed, and
expressed sympathy for, such projects as the
one covered by this Bill. Last week at a
private session in Ottawa representatives of
the departnents of agriculture and the agricultural colleges from all the provinces of
Canada considered these matters in conjunetion with the federal subcommittee on Agricultural Reconstruction, a subcornmittee of the
general committee headed by Principal James.
The consensus of opinion of that representative group of agriculturists was to the effect
that we aIll muSt walk along together. keeping
as closely as possible in touch with actual
conditions that are developing during the war,
in the knowledge that sooner or later we
shall have to come to close grips with the
most profound and serious question this
country bas ever had to face. I regard this
Bill that is before the Senate to-day as
dealing with a small but very important phase
of that future problem, and I hope it will be
approached and sympathetically supported
from that point of view.
Hon. N. M. PATERSON:
Honourable
senators, may I make just a few comments
im regard to farming? Like the honourable
senator fron Winniieg South-Centre (Hon.
Mr. Haig), I am not a farmer, and also 1ike
himn, I baive seen a good deal of distress among
larmers; so I can appreciate his remarks.
Still, I think soen honourable senators--the
honourable gentlemen fron Marquette (Hon.
Mr. Mullins) and St. Jean Baptiste (Hon. Mr.
Beaubien). for instance-have made money
out of farming and know others who have
made noney. However, I want to speak on
the situation with regard to wheat.
At the present tirne we are faced with one
of the nost serious situations I have ever
seen, owing to the fact that we have on hand
404 million bushiels of wheat. that there is a
virtual embargo against the shipment of grain
to the hcad of the lakes, and that we are on
the eve of harvesting a very bountiful crop,
grown on 21 million acres as compared with
27 million acres orlinarily, and one which will
yi<Id sornething like 450 million bushels. The
storage problem is therefore a very difficult
one.
The question of the farmer's future is one
that should be handled with patience and
courage. and a great deal of public sympathv
and assistance. We assume that we shall win
the war. We astume that when our young men
return ti
will want sonething to do. and
that living conditions in the city will net be
attractive to many of then. Those who go on
Hon.

Mr. LAMBERT.

farms should find the markets of the worid
open to the grain grower, a condition that
does not exist at present. We are now bonusing the non-growing of grain, but when the
war is over and conditions assert themselves
in normal channels, we should encourage the
growing of grain and ail kinds of farm products with freer markets all over the world
and better transportation to these markets.
I think the picture is not as dismal as it
appears to some honourable members. Certainly the scherne will require a great deal of
patience and courage. not only on the part
of those who administer the Act, but also
of those who accept farms under it when they
come back from the war front. But I would
say that the scheme is well worth while even
if only one young man makes a success for
every five that fail.
The motion was agreed te, and the Bill was
read the second time.

WAR RISK INSURANCE BILL
REPORT OF COMMITTEE

Hon. F. B. BLACK presented, and moved
concurrence in, the report of the Standing
Committee on Banking and Commerce, on
Bill 56, an Act to make provision with
respect to insurance of property against war
risks and the payment of compensation for
war damage.
He said: Honourable senators, I may say
that this Bill bas been considered at some
length by the committee, which had before it
the representatives of the Insurance Department and the individual who is going to be
in charge of this legislation when it goes into
effect.
I submit the Bill with various
amendments.
The motion was agreed to.
THIRD READING

The Hon. the SPEAKER: When shall this
Bill, as amended, be read a third time?
Hon. J. H. KING moved the third reading
of the Bill.
Hon. Mr. BLACK: I neglected to state
that I understand there is another amendment
to be moved to the Bill on the third reading.
Hon. N. M. PATERSON: Honourable
senators, I should like to move an amendment,
that this Bill, as amended, be not now read
a third time, but that it be further amended
as follows:
Page 12, line 30: For "Fund" substitute
"Account."
I was asked by the Law Clerk to move this
amendment, which is purely clerical, the
object being simply to substitute the word
"Account" for the word "Fund." The phrase
"Special Account" is used throughout the Bill,
except in this one instance.
The amendment was agreed to.
Hon. J. W. deB. FARRIS: Honourable
senators, I wish to say a word before the third
reading is given. When this Bill was in committee my honourable friend from Vancouver
(Hon. Mr. McRae) moved an amendment to

strike out the words "and trees" in section 2,
the effect of which amendment would have
been to include in the Bill the right and
possibly the duty of the Minister to make
provision for war insurance in regard to standing timber. I stated then that I intended
to vote against the proposed amendment,
although on the motion for second reading,
in this Chamber, I had spoken in support of
the principle of the amendment, and although,
of course, I was still in favour of that principle. I decided to vote against the amendment because of the statement made in committee by the honourable leader of the Government (Hon. Mr. King), which I said then
I thought should be placed on record in this
House, to the effect, as I understood, that
during the recess the Government would consider the question of making provision for
standing timber and growing crops; that it
would hear representations, if any should be
offered, and would investigate the matter
with a view to including standing timber and
growing crops in the provisions of the present
measure, or in separate provisions, if this is
found practicable and justifiable. I also understand that the Government will feel free to
deal with these matters by Order in Council
if occasion requires.
It was for those reasons that I apparently
forsook my honourable colleague from Vancouver (Hon. Mr. McRae) in the vote in
committee, and not because I was not heartily
in support of the cause he advocated.
Hon. A. D. McRAE: Honourable senators,
I think it might be well for me to repeat
at this time some of the arguments used in
the Banking and Commerce Committee for
and against my amendment. I do this, first,
to place them on record, and also for the
benefit of honourable senators who are not
members of the committee.
I think this proposed legislation is very
necessary, particularly to those sections of
Canada located on either coast. The scheme
itself I regard as a mixture of compensation
and insurance, for it is obvious from the
statement of the expert who investigated this
matter for the Government and who, I understand, estimated that the premiums payable
under the scheme would total 37,000,000, that
these would not provide sufficient coverage to
meet damages resulting from a bombardment.
Consequently, I think it is only fair to say
that in such a case the Government will have
to contribute that part of the compensation
not covered by insurance. After all, this
would be equitable, because the Government
as a rule assumes responsibility for payment
of part of the compensation for war losses
where there is no insurance.

JULY 23, 1942
Hon. J. H. KING: Honourable senators, in
reply to my honourable friend the junior
member from Vancouver (Hon. Mr. Farris) I
would inform him that the Minister of the
department interested has instructed me to say
that the insurance of timber as a war risk is
now being considered, and that he and possibly other members of the Government will
be available to hear representations from persons interested in the matter, at a time reasonably convenient to the Government. I would
point out that if it should be decided to insure
timber against war risks, it would be a matter
of Government policy whether this should be
effected under the War Measures Act or by a
special enactment like this Bill.
I should like to say to my honourable friend
the senior member from Vancouver (Hon. Mr.
McRae) that if he and his associates are really
serious in the objection which he has so ably
presented to us, they should go to the source
where timber is now controlled. Our provincial
governments control the various timber areas,
much of which is in the hands of licensees, the
governments collecting fees and royalties.
Large blocks of timber, particularly on Vancouver Island, are in the hands of investors.
Some of the timber is being taken oeff now.
Although the provincial Government has
divested itself of its rights in the timber, it
still exercises control through royalties and
licence fees. I have no doubt that if those
interested can convince the provincial Government-and from what my friend has said it
seems to me he would be a good representative
to impress the provincial Government with his
argument-and if its members desire to come
te Ottawa, they will get a fair hearing.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was
read the third time, and passed.
VETERANS' LAND BILL
REPORT OF COMMITTEE-CONSIDERATION
POSTPONED

Hon. F. B. BLACK: Honourable members,
as those who sat in the Banking and Commerce Committee this morning will remember,
we spent a good deal of time in examining
Bill 65. We amended the Bill in several
particulars. Most of the amendments are
merely clerical, but some are important. As,
however, the report has reached me since I
came into the Chamber, I have not been able
to check the amendments against the memorandum I kept during the passage of the
Bill through the committee. It will net, I
think, delay the passage of this Bill to post-

pone the consideration of the report until
to-morrow. That would give me an opportunity of checking the report.
Hon. Mr. KING: Agreed.

TAFFERT DIVORCE CASE
MINORITY REPORT

On the order for the consideration of the
eightieth report of the Standing Committee
on Divorce with respect to the petition of
William Taffert, together with the evidence
produced before the said, committee:
Hon. JAMES MURDOCK: Honourable
senators, I understand that the honourable
the Acting Chairman of the Divorce Committee (Hon. Mr. Aseltine) is net here to-day,
but possibly the House will permit me te
couple up with the report before us my
minority report. It is as follows:
Minority Report
In the matter of the petition of William
Taffert, of Montreal, P.Q., praying for a Bill
of divorce from Annie Gross Taffert, otherwise
known as Amy Gross Taffert, of the said city.
I, the undersigned member of the Standing
Committee on Divorce, dissent from the recommendation contained in paragraph 2 of the 80th
report of the Standing Committee on Divorce
with respect te the above petition, on the ground
that, in my opinion, the woman in the red hat
was net the respondent, Annie Gross Taffert,
and that the allegations contained in paragraplhs
8 and 9 of the petition have not therefore been
proven. Also in respect to paragraph 10 of
the petition, the evidence appeared to disclose
that the petitioner deserted the respondent, and
not what is charged in paragraph 10.
The above minority report is filed for the
following reasons.
Respectfully submitted.
James Murdock.
July 23, 1942.
The reasons are as follows:
The Petition of William Taffert for a Bill
of Divorce from his wife, Annie Gross Taffert,
was heard by the Divorce Committee on March
17, 1942, but a decision granting the divorce
was not given until July 21, and was given
then in the absence of the Chairman, the
Honourable C. W. Robinson.
These people were married in the State of
New York on March 1, 1920, and were both
young at that time.
They only remained in New York a few
months after their marriage in 1920, and for
sore years, or until 1936, they lived in Montreal, where Mr. Taffert appears to have been
associated with his father in business.
About 1937 these people, with a young
daughter, went back to New York and lived
there

for

some

time,

and

while

there

Mr.

Taffert, according to the evidence, was employed
as the representative of certain liquor interests.

THE SENATE

The Hon. the SPEAKER: The question,
honourable senators, is on the adoption of
the report.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: I rise to a point of
order. Rule 143 of the Senate of Canada,
relating to divorce, provides:
After such hearing and inquiry the committee
shall report to the Senate, stating whether the
requirements of these rules have been complied
with in all material respects; and, if it shall
have been then found that any such requirement has not been so complied with, stating
in what respect there has been default, and
also stating the conclusions arrived at and the
action recommended by the committee.
2. The report shall be accompanied by the
testimony of the witnesses examined, and by
all documents, papers and instruments refer-red to the oommittee by the Senate or
received in evidence by the oommittee.
I take the position that without the printed
record before us we cannot deal with this
motion at the present time. Someone will
say, of course, that we have often done so
before. Yes, I know that; but we are not
going to do it now unless we set aside these
rules. I think that the evidence in this
particular case was sent to the printer two
or three days ago, and that the printed
evidence is to be available to-morrow. Your
Honour, I submit that in the meantime we
cannot deal with this particular motion.
Hon. A. B. COPP: Honourable senators,
this order is in the name of the Acting
Chairman of the Committee, the honourable
senator from West Central Saskatchewan
(Hon. Mr. Aseltine). He did not speak to
me about it; but, inasmuch as I am a
member of the committee, I may say to the
the honourable senator from Parkdale (Hon.
Mr. Murdock), after listening with a very
great deal of interest to his essay in regard
to what may or may not be assumed, and
after hearing the rule cited to the effect that
we may not go on to-day, I was going to ask,
in the absence of the Acting Chairman, that
the matter stand until his return.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: He will be here to-morrow.
Hon. Mr. COPP: At that time, I presume,
the evidence will be before the Senate.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: Is it suggested
that the report be laid on the Table?
Hon. Mr. COPP: That the order stand.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: Stand.
The Senate adjourned until to-morrow, at
3 p.m.

Friday, July 24, 1942.
The Senate met at 3 p.m., the Speaker in
the Chair.
Prayers and routine proceedings.
NATIONAL RESOURCES MOBILIZATION
BILL
FIRST READING

A message was received from the House of
Commons with Bill 80, an Act to amend the
National Resources Mobilization Act, 1940.
The Bill was read the first time.
VETERANS' LAND BILL
REPORT OF COMMITTEE

Hon. F. B. BLACK presented, and moved
concurrence in, the report of the Standing
Committee on Banking and Commerce on
Bill 65, an Act to assist war veterans to settle
upon the land.
He said: Honourable senators, the committee has had this Bill under consideration
and beg leave to report the same with a large
number of amendments, more than thirty in
all, none of which changes the intent of the
original Bill to any material degree.
The motion was agreed to.
THIRD READING

Hon. J. H. KING moved the third reading
of the Bill.
Hon. A. D. McRAE: Honourable senators,
I think we all are in agreement with the
objective of this Bill. The committee took
a great deal of time and care in considering
the similar measure which was passed after
the last war, and the steps which will be
taken to profit by the mistakes made in
connection with it. Speaking generally, I
think the department made a very favourable
impression on the committee. The type of
land to which most attention was given was
farm land, whether at present occupied or
unoccupied.
It was stated that a large
number of farms were being operated by aged
men who had no sons over fourteen years
old to carry on the work, and that presumably
many of these properties would be available
for purchase under the Act. As was the case
after the last war, the matter of purchase
is one that will involve great care. It is
necessary to make sure, first of all, that the
farm is worth the price to be paid for it,

44567-17
REVIRED EDITION

SENATE
and, secondly, that it is a farm on which
a war veteran can make a living. In these
respects I think the department is well
aware of the risks which should be guarded
against.
Only brief reference was made in the department'.s report to what might be called virgin
development, or the settlement of land which
has not yet been brought under cultivation.
In general, vacant farms which are capable of
production and are located conveniently to
transportation, and farms which, though now
occupied, are likely to become vacant soon
because their owners are too old to operate
them much longer, would have first consideration and perhaps be deemed most desirable.
But with regard to this programme I should
like to call to the attention of the House
this other feoature, the opening up of some
new districts in the last few years, a development wlich has brought them within the
sphere of farm settlement. This is a mechanical war, and after it is over many of our
returned soldiers will be competent to operate
modern machinery. Much of the land with
light timber on it, heretofore considered undesirable for setilement, could at no great
cost per acre be cleared by returned soldiers
operating modern equipment. In this way
farms could be made available to our soldiers
without much capital investment for the land
itself.
In

colonization work we have never in the

past been favourable to what are called community settlements. However, if we take into
consideration the developments of the last
twenty-five or thirty years, it would seem
that to ensure succ'essful farm settlement farming communities should be established and
furnished with those comforts and conveniences which are essential to keeping
people contented on the land.
An outstanding opportunity in this regard
is now presented to us by the construction of
the Alaska highway. I have in mind the
district in British Columbia extending north
from Fort St. John to Fort Nelson and
then across to the foot-hills. I have flown
over that country several times, en route to
and from the Yukon, I have talked to the
tirappers and the odd storekeeper at Fort
Nelson, and to the best of my information
I would say that that district covers an area
of probably 200 by 150 miles. It is parklike country with small timber, little of it
of commercial value. There is a heavy growth
of grass and other vegetation. The land as
a whole is good, though in spots there is
considerable muskeg. The country is similar
te, and may be regarded as an extension of,
the Peace River district, with which I am
Hon. Mr. McRAE.

quite familiar. From the information I have
there is a ridge of very hcavy timber between
the Peare River district and what we may
call the Fort Nelson district.
On referring to the map honourable members may be inclined to think that the
'winter climate of a district so far north must
be very cold, but I would point out that
as a matter of fact it does not vary a great
deal frorn that of Edmonton, for as you
go north and the Rocky Mountains become
less prominenit the Chinook winds exert a
moderating influence, the result being a livable
winter climate. Indeed, the winters there are
not as cold as in districts further south. I
doubt that winter temperatures drop as low
as around Winnipeg.
Hon. Mr. HAIG:

That is a warm country.

Hon. Mr. McRAE: In some respects. Certainly winter is less severe in the Fort Nelson
district than around Kapuskasing.
The point I wish to call to the attention
of the House-and I hope it will receive the
attention of officers of the department concerned when they come to consider this
matter-is the fact that there lies a virgin
country, not complicated by any homestead
or other settlement whatever, and it affords
ample scope for our returned men. Without
doubt, that district wili be colonized after this
war is over, for then people will follow the

new Alaska highway into it.
It may be that this matter could well be
considered when our post-war employ-ment
problem comes up. The opening up of that
district in a large way would certainly take
care of many of our returned soldiers, since
it would represent very useful employment
following the war, tbus helping out not only
settlers, but also returned men for whom we
have to find work.
I have taken up the time of the House
simply to call attention to this vast area
in the hope that the opportunity to develop
it in connection with soldier settlement and
the solution of our post-war labour problem
will not be overlooked.
Hon. Mr. BLACK: I am sure the honourable gentleman's proposal has aroused the
interest of all members. I should like to be
quite clear on one point. Does he suggest
that a number of returned men be engaged
and supplied with adequate mochanized equipment to build roads, clear a large area, and
make the land available for any returned
soldiers wiho may desire to settle there?
Hon. Mr. McRAE: Yes. I should think
that in the carrying out of a scheme of that
kind a pretty efficient organization would have

JULY 24, 1942
to be set up. It probably would not be in
order to clear ail the land, but perhaps forty
acres in a quarter-section could be cleared
and broken. The soldiers whe diid the clearing would probably settle there to a large
extent. and they would have employment in
opeoing up the land. The scheme would
require careful preparation, and should be
carried out on a really large scale.
I mention this matter at this time because
later on the situation may become complicated by liomesteaders and others going
into that area. The land is now completely
virgin. There are no settiers in the country,
only the trappers and the men at the Hudson
Bay posts.
lion. Mr. FAiRRIS: What is the extent of
the area?
Hon. Mr. MeRAF: I would say that as
yo>u fly in to Fort Nelson from. the west,-from
White Horse, the country is good from about
sixty miles west to the foothilîs. To the
north of Fort Nelson it extends for about
sixty miles, and to the east for easily one
hundred miles. As you go south from Fort
Nelson you have good country for seventyfive or eighty miles. Then there is a ridge of
bis and you corne into the Fort St. John
district, which extends north for about forty
miles and which has a certain amount of
settlemeot in it. The whole area, elîminating the Fort St. John district, miglit be said
to be one hundred and fifty miles square. It
is a large area, and would be good for a
scheme of community settlement, if that should
be decided upon. I think I have answered
the question.
This is something that sliould not be engaged in piecemeal. It ought to be thoroughly
investigated and, then deait with i a large
way. It would not oniy provide farms without any considerable capital investment, but
would aiso provide employment for returned
men.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Is that the same
territory the honourable senator was interested i in 1931 or 1932, when lie proposed in
this Chamber that the Government should
inaugurate a plan to bring a considerable
number of settlers out to that part of the
country?
Hon. Mr. McRAE: I think the honourable
senator fromn Parkdiale (Hon. Mr. Murdock)
refers to a speech on the Peace River district
that 1 -made in the House of Commons. I do
flot remember making such a speech in this
House.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: I think that if I
had a few minutes I could find it.
44567-17J

Hon. Mr. McRAE: I think my real speech
on the developrnent of the Peace River district was made in the Huse of Commons.
The territory I arn speaking of now miglit
well be considered as a westerly extension of
the Peace River country, with a ridge of timbered hilîs inýtervening. It is much the same
as the Peace River country, but not quite as
rich.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Who owns it?
Hon. Mr. McRAE: At the present time
it is owned by the province of British
Columbia.
Ilo n. R. B. bORNER: 1 amn very MUC11
interested in what bas been said by the
honourable senator. Only the day before
yesterday I was speaking to a contractor Whlo
built some of the airports which partially
follow the route of the Alaska highway. In
asking him about the country I was very
much surprised to learn that the most advanced crops he had seen were in the Fort
St. John region, in the eastern end of this
territory. I should have expected the crops
there to bie later, but lie informed me that
they were the finest and the most advanced
lie had seen across Canada.
Hon. LOUIS COTE: Honourable senators,
may I add just a word, and say how interested
I was in the remarks of tlie honourable
senator from Vancouver, and particularly hie
suggestion that the undertaking should be
carried on as a community settlement scheme.
We all know that in the past the various
provinces, eitlier with or without the lielp of
the Federal Government, have engaged in
land settlement schemes for the alleviation of
the liardships of unempioyment, or for other
reasons. We know also wliat a relatively
small measure of suceess has been achieved
by them. Sometimes the reason for this has
been bad land, sometimes bad settlers, but
very often it has been that the settler has
been allowed to pick some isolated spot, far
fromn any community and far from neigliboure,
wliere from the moment of settiement lie has
been deprived of association with his fellow
men and the benefits of eommunity 111e of any
kind. That lias been a great deterrent to the
success of settlement schemes.
Hon. Mr. MIJRDOCK: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. COTE: That is why 1 heartily
welcome the suggestion of the lionourable
senator from Vancouver, that i the development of the schemes for returned men very
serious consideration sliould be given to cernmunity settiement.
It is strange, in view of the lessons of the
past, that i modern times we have been so

260

SENATE

unsuccessful in our endeavours to settle land.
Those who know the history of the settlement
of Lower Canada, even when it was New
France, will remember the well ordered and
well considered scheme of Colbert, who was
the real power behind the settlement in the
province of New France. In his scheme that
feature, which is so essential, was not overlooked.
In those days seigniories were
established. The seignieur, who was an overseer or overlord, would establish himself, and
the settlers would all settle around him.
Furthermore, in each settlement there would
be a certain number of trained and skilled
artisans, such as blacksmiths and the like, and
professional men, such as doctors. If there
was not a doctor in the community there was
at least a man who knew something about
drugs. In other words, it was made sure that
in each seigniory or settlement the essential
elements of community life were present. That
went far towards the success of the settlement
of New France.
Something of the same kind took place in
Upper Canada, although there the seigniorial
system was not adopted. There the Government of those days made sure that the settlers
would take up one township at a time, and
would settle and develop that township. The
saine result was achieved: there was brought
together a group of human beings who could
enjoy the benefits of human companionship
and the other advantages of community life.
Hon. JOHN T. HAIG: Honourable members, in order that nobody may misunderstand
my position, I want to say that I am opposed
to this legislation. I have been opposed to it
from the very beginning. The other day I
listened to the Director while he gave a
history of experiences in connection with such
schemes as this. It it not necessary to publish
it by and large. I have followed the settlement schemes of Manitoba, Saskatchewan and
Alberta, and know that they were net successful; and I am advised that British Columbia
had the same experience. No matter what
rosy pictures may be painted, a scheme cannot be a success if the basis of it is wrong.
The plan suggested by the honourable senator
from Vancouver bas much to commend it, but
such schernes have failed before and will fail
again. It is true that from experience the
Director bas learned much that is to be
avoided, but there is a fundamental difficulty
which nobody can avoid. Farming is a most
difficult operation to carry on. I know nothing
about farming in Eastern Canada, but I know
the situation in Western Canada pretty well. I
lived on a farm there from the time when I
was a small boy until I was twenty-five years
of age. My father was a homesteader. I
know the history of farming in the West.
Hon. Mr. COTE.

Furthermore, as a practising solicitor in the
city of Winnipeg J have had on opportunity
of observing conditions in agriculture for forty
years.
Under ord-inary circumstances farming cannot pay. In order to make a success of it a
man must be highly skilled, and he must be
a good business man. I do net want to
repeat what I said the other day, but I would
ask honourable members to get the report on
any farming scheme undertaken in the past
and see what happened to it. I suggest that
under this scheme, even if you are lucky,
you will lose net only the interest on your
capital investment, and the cost of management, but 50 per cent of your capital as well;
and you will not settle as many men on the
land as you could establish in homes in
rural communities in Western Canada, and
provide with annuities, at an equal expenditure. This is in accordance with the history
of every one of these schemes. I could give
you the figures of the Manitoba Farm Loan
scheme and the Manitoba Rural Credit
scheme, in which Government expenses came
out of public funds and were net charged
against the scherne at all.
I an all for helping the returned soldier,
and I believe that educational schemes for
soldiers are all to the good. Such schemes
will be more costly than we might expect,
and many mistakes will be made. Still I
say these endeavours are all to the good.
I know there are net many in this House
who agree with me upon this matter. It is
tasy to pass legislation, but, having spent
seventeen years in the Manitoba Legislature,
where I lcard similar schemes propounded,
I have made up my mind that I am net
going to sit silent here when we are asked
to support this one, which in my opinion
can never be a success. I repeat that I am
opposed to this measure. In the first place
it will be disastrpus from the point of view
of cost to the people. I do not care how
good the management may be, nor how highly
the officials are paid, the scheme cannot
succeed. Farming is a kind of business that
requires a special ability. Yeu can go through
any district in Manitoba and SaskatchewanJ mention these provinces because I know
them best-and you will find some farmers
who have succeeded and others who have
failed. All had much the same start in life
and all are on much the same type of land.
I do net know of any profession or occupation
that requires greater skill than farming does.
After a man has gone to war, has been
paraded down the streets and shown the
bright lights, it is extremely difficult to get
him to go back on the land. The comparative

JULY 24, 1942
dreariness of farm life causes a restlessness
that makes it almost impossible for him to
succeed as a farmer. What is the history of
farmers' soifs who have been educated in
our agricultural colleges and universities? I
think that of all the graduates in agriculture
-I mean, not the short-term men, but those
who took the four-year course-fewer than
10 per cent are back as farmers now.
Hon. Mr. MARSHALL: I just want to
say to my honourable friend that if that is
true of Manitoba, it is not true of any other
province.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: It is true of every other
province. My honourable friend is thinking of
mon who take the short course.
Hon. Mr. MARSHALL: No.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: The men who have taken
the B.Sc. degree in agriculture, after graduating from the four-year course, may have
become directors of agricultural undertakings,
or editors of agricultural magazines, or may
be similarly engaged, but they have not gone
back to the farm.
Hon. Mr. MARSHALL: Will my honourable
friend allow me? They are farming in every
concession in Ontario. I will take him around
and show him, if he will give me a chance.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I know of the situation
only in my own province. I am speaking not
by guess, but in accordance with information
that I acquired in the Manitoba Legislature.
Not ten per cent of the four-year graduates
are back on the land. The rest may be instructing in colleges and schools, acting as
directors of various undertakings, or editors of
magazines, and doing all kinds of other things.
They may be performing very useful service.
I am not questioning that. The money expended on their education may have been well
spent. I am not questioning that. It may be
that they have helped to place agriculture in
this country and elsewhere on a more scientific
basis. I am not questioning that. The point I
make is that once a farmer's son puts in four
years at a university or college it is very
difficult to get him to go back to the old life.
And once a man has spent three or four years
as a soldier, he will find life on the farm very
dull. Such was the experience in connection
with the last scheme. More than 50 per cent
of the men have gone from the land.
I am raising my voice in protest because I
do not want to have it said I sat here and
allowed this measure to pass without opposing
it. I am opposed to the Bill. I think it will
result in a terrifie waste of money, money that
you could spend far better by helping in many
other ways the very men you are trying to
help by this measure.

261

Hon. A. L. BEAUBIEN: Honourable senators, I had not intended to say anything on
this motion, but after listening to the honourable senator from Winnipeg South-Centre
(Hon. Mr. Haig), I think I probably should
suggest that the chances of success for those
who go on farms under this scheme are not
as poor as he indicates. The soldier settlement scheme of the last war was put into effect
in a period of general inflation. At that time
we had had no experience with any plan of
the kind, and as a result many mistakes were
made. Large numbers of war veterans were
settled on very inferior land where no man
would have any chance of success. High prices
were paid for the land purchased, as well as
for equipment and stock. The honourable
senator referred to the Manitoba Farm Loan
scheme and the Manitoba Rural Credit scheme.
They were put into effect near the end of the
last war, or shortly after peace was declared.
Loans were made on land which was valued
at an inflated figure. I know, for I had a loan
myself. Not only that, but it seemed to me
with my knowledge of Western Canada-and
I have lived there sixty years-that some of
this land was not very good.

Stock and equip-

ment also were bought at highly inflated prices.
Although the application of those provincial
schemes was not successful and resulted in the

loss of a good deal of money, and a large
sum was lost under the soldier settlement
scheme of 1919, that is no reason why the

land settlement provided for by this Bill
should not succeed. The experience we have
gained in the meantime will be very helpful.
Besides, this plan will be put into effect under
different conditions. My honourable friend
from Winnipeg South-Centre says that exservice men will find farm life dull in comparison with the bright lights, but I would say
to him that if we are taxed after the war as
we are being taxed to-day, instead of bright
lights we may have a blackout. The bright
lights may not be as attractive after this war
as they were after the last one.
When the war is over, among the men who
will have fought to defend our country will
be many who have worked on farms and will
want to go back to the land, but whose parents
could not afford to establish them. We are
no longer getting $2.25 a bushel for wheat.
How would it be possible to place these
young men on the land without a scheme of
this kind? My honourable friend from Winnipeg South-Centre is objecting to the scheme.
but so far as I can find out he has not offered
anything in its place. When men who have
been brought up on the farm reach the age of
twenty-four or twenty-five or more, you cannet put them to work in the cities. They

SENATE

262

would feel out of place there. You must have
a scheme of some kind for settling them on
the land.
There are some features of this Bill that I
do not like. For instance, the Government
will allow up to $3,600 for the purchase of a
farm, but only $1,200 for equipment and
stock. If a man settles on 240 acres or on a
half-section, 320 acres-I am thinking of
Western Canada, where these are the usual
sizes of farms-he will not be able to do much
with the stock and equipment that can be
bought for $1,200.
Hon. Mr. HARMER:
he started.

The motion was agreed te.
The Senate adjourned until Monday, July
27, at 3 p.m.

THE SENATE

He would fail before

Hon. A. L. BEAUBIEN: That is only one
of the features of the Bill that I do not like.
However, the administrators of the scheme will
gain experience from its application, and if
they find that $1.200 is not sufficient for stock
and equipment they can come back to Parliament next year or the year after and suggest that this allowance be increased by probably $800. While the war is on we must
provide some means whereby, when peace is
restored, our ex-service men who were brought
up on farms or in the rural parts of Canada
will not be forced to live in the cities, but will
be able to get suitable employment in the
country. where they will be with God's nature
ail the time.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: Honourable senators, the question is on the motion for third
reading of this Bill, as amended. Is it your
pleasure to adopt the motion?
Some Hon. SENATORS: Carrid.

REINSTATEMENT IN CIVIL
EMPLOYMENT BILL
COMMONS DISAGREEMENT WITH SENATE
AMENDMENT

The Hon. the SPEAKER: Honourable
senators, a message has been received from
the House of Commons in the following
words:
Resolved, that a nesage be sent to the Senate
to acquaint their Honours that this House
agrees to their first ane iment aindl the anendment in the title of Bill No. 5. an Act to
provide for the reinstatement in civil employmnent of disetarged mieibers of His Majesty's
Forces or other designatet
ltas.ses of persons,
and disagrees with their second amendmtent for
the following reasoni:
The operation of the said amendment would
detract froi the enforcmient of the Act.

Hon. Mr. KING moved that the message
be taken into consideration forthwith.
The motion was agreed to.
Hon. 'Mr. KING: Honourable senators will
notice that the reason given for the Commons
disagreement with our second amendment is
that it would detract from the enforcement of
the Act. I have had an opportunity to speak
to the Minister of Labour and he has told
me there would be difficulty in administering
the Act. In his speech in the other House
he said:
There is no intention of im1prisoning anyone
under these provisions.
Section 9 is the
penalty section, anñt it provides for a fine not
exceeding $500 and a sun not exceeding an
amount equal to twelve weeks' remuneration
received by the indlividual appealing to the
courts. That clause gave the eommitteethat is the committee of the House of
Commons-considerable concern. Some mnembers thought
that it should be even stronger.

JULY 27, 1942
In view of what has been said, I would
move with the consent of the Senate:
That the Senate do not insist upon its second
amendment to Bill 5, an Act to provide for the
reinstatement in civil employment of discharged
members of His Majesty's Forces or other
designated classes of persons.
Honourable
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE:
senators, I concur in the change suggested by
the Minister, provided that it meets with the
approval of the Senate.
The motion was agreed to.
Hon. Mr. KING: I would further move:
That a message be sent to the House of
Commons to acquaint that House that the
Senate does not insist upon its second amendtnent made to Bill 5, an Act to provide for the
reinstatement in civil employment of discharged
members of His Majesty's Forces or other
designated classes of persons, to which the
House of Commons have disagreed.
The motion was agreed to.

POOLING OF BRITISH AND AMERICAN
PRODUCTION
INQUIRY

On the Orders of the Day:
Hon. A. D. McRAE: Honourable senators,
on June 12 last, prior to our adjournment, I
asked the honourable leader of the Government if he could make a statement to us in
connection with the reported arrangement
between Great Britain and the United States
whereby the United States assumed direction
of all production on this continent, including
Canada. I would again ask the honourable the
leader if he could give' us that information.
Hon. Mr. KING: I am very sorry to inform
my honourable friend and the other members
of the Senate that the information has not as
yet come to hand. I am hoping to be able to
give it before Parliament adjourns.
Hon. Mr. McRAE: Honourable senators, I
think I should state to you that through certain sources I have received information which
leads me to believe that the arrangement is

2w3

now in being and that conferences are being
held between officials in Canada and officials
in Washington with regard to the marketing
of products formerly sold direct by Canada
to Great Britain. I think the matter is of
such importance that the Government should
explain the arrangement to the producers in
Canada, because trouble will arise sooner or
later unless they know the basis on which
they are producing.
I would press the honourable leader of th 2
House to give us this information. There
are no war secrets to be disclosed by so
doing. The arrangement may be advantageous for many reasons, but on the face
of it there appears to be danger that we may
lose the position we have been working up
to for a generation or longer in the British
market.
Hon. Mr. KING: I shall do my best to
get the information.
Hon. Mr. HARDY: Unless I am out of
order, I should like to join with the honourable senator from Vancouver in his request.
TAFFERT DIVORCE CASE
REPORT OF COMMITTEE

The Senate proceeded to the consideration
of the eightieth report of the Standing
Committee on Divorce, with respect to the
petition of William Taffert, together with the
evidence produced before the said committee.
Hon. W. M. ASELTINE: Honourable
senators, I regret very much that the honourable gentleman from Parkdale (Hon. Mr.
Murdock) has seen fit to oppose this petition
for divorce. Of course I have no objection
whatever to his filing a minority report. That
report, as I read it, is based on the question
of identity, and in my opinion, and in the
opinion of the others who voted in favour
of the divorce, is not in accordance with the
evidence nor the weight of evidence.
The honourable senator also advises me that
he is sending a certain memorandum to members of the House of Commons dealing with
this matter. I hope he has not done this,
because in my opinion-I may be wrong-an
honourable senator, particularly a member of
the Divorce Committee, should not act as
counsel for the defence and send a memorandum of that kind. I say that because the
functions of the Divorce Committee are different from those of other committees of the
Senate. These functions are of a semijudicial nature, in that the members of the
committee sit as trial judges. They hear the
sworn testimony of the witnesses produced by
the lawyers who appear before the committee
in their gowns, and the whole procedure is the
same as that followed in the courts of the

264

SENATE

different provinces, and is in accordance with
the procedure in England. The committee
includes four lawyers who, before they
became senators, had a good deal of experience in divorce matters in their respective
provinces. The other members are four laymen and one doctor. Since I have been a
member of the committee very careful consideration has been given to every petition
that has come before it. I wish to pay tribute
to the late senior senator fron Winnipeg
(the late Hon. Mr. McMeans), who was
Chairman of this committee for a number
of years and did wonderful 'work. The present
Chairman of the committee is the honourable
senator from Moncton (Hon. Mr. Robinson),
who in his kindly and fair way considers all
the evidence and gives his decision accordingly.
This committee works bard. It sits net only
in the morning, but also in the afternoon and
evening, and sometimes when the work is
not finished on Friday there is a sitting on
Saturday. Time and time again the Divorce
Committee is in session when the Senate itself
is adjourned and all senators except members
of the comnittee are away. The work is not
very congenial.
In fact, it has certain degrading features about it, and in the past it
has been difficult to get lionourable senators
to serve on it. After these few introductory
remarks I wish to deal briefly with the
evidence in this case.
I say this without fear of contradiction,
that there was no reason to doubt the identity of the woman in question in this case.
Only one member of the committee had any
doubt in that regard.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK:
May I ask the
honourable gentleman if he heard the evidence
of the petitioner and the two detectives, or
any one of them?
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE:
I heard all the
evidence in this case with the exception of
the evidence in chief given by the petitioner.
I heard all his cross-examination and all the
witnesses for the respondent, and I paid very
careful attention to everything that was said.
The 'respondent was represented by two very
capable counsel, who cross-examined all the
petitioner's witnesses in great detail, and I
think I can safely say that in no particular
were these counsel able to cast any reflection
on the evidence given by those witnesses.
With respect to the evidence of the respondenit,
Mrs. Taffert, I would say that I was net at all
impressed by her. Before she had been on
the stand very long I came to the conclusion
that she had. come there with the intenit and
purpose of denying everything. Her daughter
was one of her witnesess, and I also concluded
that Mrs. Taffert was very anxious to satisfy
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE.

her daughter that she, Mrs. Taffert, was of
chaste character. I might say further that the
respondent was very positive in her remarks;
too positive, in fact. For that reason I did
not accept her testimony. I do net believe it
was true. In my opinion the evidence of her
daughter was not satisfactory, either, owing
to the fact that she first denied her mother
ever went out at niglt, but later, on crossexamination, she qualified that statement.
On the question of identity of the woman
in the case I wish to refer honourable members
to pages 30 and 31 of the committee's printed
report. This is from the evidence of Mr.
Green:
At about 5.15 a.m0. we entered 96. 'Mr. Taffert,
MNr. Manel and my1self. aund I knocked ou the
door of number 10.
A man's voice answered,
asking who it was. T said it was the boss. He
said, "Just a inuiite."
We waited several
miniutes and the door was sligitiy opened and
we entered, the three of us. There was no
light on in the rooi: there w as a streak of
dayliglit comuing throughBy the Cliairian:
Q. Tell us a little more about our entering.
-A.
Ie opened the door siilitly. and I pu sied
the door, walked in.
Manel was behinl me
and MNfr. Taffert was lait.
Q. Mou were not invited in?--A. Certainly
not. Senator. We were uninvited and unwelcune gutests.
This mn
said who are we. and
what did we want. I said, "This nian is this
woian's
husband."
He said.
"We' w eren't
doing any thing, we are not doing anytiiiiig."

Q. The man said that?--A. Yes. And if J
rcînemeber rigltly. I think Mrs. Taffert also
said, "We didn't tIo ainy thing."

The same witness gave this evidence, as
recorded on pages 27 and 28:
By Mr. Garber:
Q. You went away?-A. Yes, sir.
Q. When did you return?-A. We returned
on Thursday, May 1.
Q. What tiie?-A. Seven p.m.
Q. Did anything happen on that evening?A. Yes, Mrs. Taffert left at 10.20 p.m. and she
wentQ. How did you come to know it -was Mrs.
Taffert?-A. Mr. Taffert identified ber.
Q. You saw the lady going out of the house?
.A.
Yes.
Q. Where did she go?-A. To tic drug-store
at the corner of Prince Arthur and Park
Avenue.
Then the Chairman put this question:
Q. Is this lady here the one you saw?
He had reference to the lady who was before
the committee at the time, the respondent.
The answer was:
Yes, senator.
Therefore there was no doubt at all in my
mind-nor, I presume, in the minds of other
members of the committee who voted in faveur
of granting the petition-as to the identity
of the woman. The woman in question was
clearly the respondent. Since this matter came

JULY 27, 1942
up I have read the evidence over carefully
many times, and I think it clearly discloses
that fact. I am therefore asking the House
to adopt the majority report of the committee,
and I so move.
Hon. JAMES MURDOCK: Honourable
senators, I do not quite understand my status
here. I made a minority report a few days
ago, but I do not find any reference to it in
the Orders of the Day. I presume my position
will be determined by the action taken on
this motion just moved by the honourable
Acting Chairman of the Divorce Committee
(Hon. Mr. Aseltine). In his opening remarks
he expressed the hope that I had nýot sent anything in connection with this matter to members of the House of Commons. Well, let me
say I have. I sent two copies of my minority
report and reasons therefor to the Rev. Mr.
Hansell. Why to the Rev. Mr. Hansell?
Because he and another honourable member
of the House of Commons had expressed great
interest in the work of the Divorce Committee.
On one occasion they were present at a full
session of the committee, sitting in the judges'
seats there and taking cognizance of everything
that went on. Incidentally we had bef'ore us
that day a rather peculiar case, and I think
Mr. Hansell agreed with the committee's
decision upon it. My honourable friend the
Acting Chairman states the Rules prohibit
me from conveying any information to these
gentlemen; the reason being, I presume, that
I may not give them my personal view.
The Acting Chairman is right when he says
the Divorce Committee works hard and puts
in a good deal of time. Is it unfair for me to
say that for the last two or three years, since
I have been a member of that committee, I
have spent more hours on it than any other
honourable member? And is it not proper for
me to add that in no single case that has come
before our committee have the Rules of
the Senate been complied with? I can prove
that, but we will not go into that just now
unless someone insists. However, we shall do
so a little later, if I should be sitting on the
Divorce Committee again.
What is interesting in this particular case is
the fact that it was heard as far back as the
17th day of March. Maybe I should not
say this, but I think the Chairman of the
committee (Hon. Mr. Robinson) held virtually the same views as I do on the case.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: I do not think the
honourable senator should make that statement. I had the other impression.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: All right, but that
was my opinion. In any event, from the
17th of March to -the 21st of July, until my
honourable friend was acting as Chairman
44567-18

265

of the committee, we did not hear a single
contention such as has been put before us
to-day. But my honourable friend the Acting
Chairman comes on the job, this is the only
case left undecided, and he says that we will
put it through.
Now, what is there to this thing? Why
am I interested? I am thinking back a few
thousand years to the case of the first man
I recall hearing about who contemplated
getting behind the statement that a woman
tempted him. He said, "The woman tempted
me and I did eat." Ever since that time
certain lazy, selfish, over-sexed males have
been trying to unload something upon some
woman. In the work in which I was engaged
all my life before I entered this distinguished
Chamber I came to know something of
what I am talking about. I have seen it in
other walks of life. And, in this particular
case, what have we before us? We have
a man and a woman who as care-free and
happy young people were married in New
York in 1920. Shortly after their marriage
they came to Montreal, where some of the
woman's people and the man's father lived.
The man went into business to some extent
with his father. It is intimated that he
helped-I am not sure this is in the evidence,
but I infer from the woman's testimony that
he helped to wreck his father's business. They
went back to New York about 1936, when our
friend the petitioner started in the liquor
business and collected money for the sales he
made. Whether the business was legal or
illegal I do not know. In any case he spent
the collected money to the tune of about
$1,000, and was liable to be sent to jail
only that the woman's people gave him the
amount of the deficiency. A little while later
he was out of the liquor business and was
interested in something else that he was trying
to get into in New York, and he put up an
argument that he needed $500 in order to
join a union to protect himself. He got the
$500 from the woman's relatives.

He did not

need the money. It was only a "phoney'
claim, a frame-up. He spent the money. A
little w-hile later, having fallen down a
couple of times in New York and sand-bagged
his wife's relatives for money, he returned
to Montreal, declining to bring, or being
financially unable to bring, his wife and child
with him. About eleven months later his wife
got tired of living in New York alone and of
trying to support their daughter, or having
her folks support the two of them, and she
sent him word she was coming back to
Montreal. She came back. He met her and
their daughter and took them to a room in
a "dump"-pardon the expression, but that is
what it means in the evidence--a room not

266

SENATE

fit for his wife and daughter to live in.
They made a complaint and were transferred
to a room on Hutchison street, and Mr.
Taffert undertook to pay the rent for that
room. So things went on until the latter part
of April, 1941-a year ago last April, remember.
Then Mr. Taffert served notice that he would
no longer pay the room rent.
He proceeded to hire a couple of detectives.
My friend the Acting Chairman laid considerable stress upon the evidence of these
detectives. Pardon me if I do not. We have
positive proof, both the Acting Chairman and
J, that one pair of detectives before us were
absolute and unqualified perjurers.
Hon. Mtlr. HARDY: In this case?
Hon. Mr. MURDOCE: Not in this case,
but in another.
In my humble judgment
there are two othi sets of detectives that are
just as much porjurers, only they are more
foxy and deliberate and careful about the
way they present their evidence. I do not
believe a single word of the evidence given
cither by Green or Manel. By the way, as
to Manol, if ever you saw a subservient
understuly in your life it was that fellow.
You could tell lie was only parroting wbat
had been given to him by Mr. Green in conversation with Ir. Taffert.
And so we come to the actual circumstances. Is anybody in this Senate or elsewhere gullihle en.ough to believe that a case
of this kind, lasting eight hours and thirty
minutes, could occur, of all places, around the
corner of St. Antoine and Windsor streets,
Montreal, just outside the Canadian Pacific
elevator? Then, to make it better, along they
went. they say. up .to Sherbrooke street, and
after they had all been on duty for ten hours,
why, Mr. Green magnanimously offered to
drive Mr. Manel and Mr. Taffert home. He
did so. Between five and six o'clock in the
morning ho loaded them into his car and
took them home, where t-bey needed some
"shut-eye," being tired right out. But Mr.
Green was not. He had a fellow back on the
job, and a "stoogie" woman, in my judgment,
to whom he wanted to bid good-night before
he put them off the job. Then, of all things,
we are asked to believeHon. Mr. ASELTINE: I wish the honourable gentleman would stick to the evidence.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: I am deliberately
doing so. I will quote it for you if you want
to take up that ýmuch time. Back went Mr.
Green, and at six o'clock in the morning he
was just in time to see this pair of his, who,
I think, were either his or Taffert's employees,
come out of the bouse on Sherbrooke street
and get into a car and start driving home to
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK.

the Hutchison street address.

Unbelievable

lies! Surely it could not happen except in
the wildest dreams of some fellow who wanted
to build up a case. And' yet. to make it
better, ho drove carefully after this pair to the
so-called home of the woman on Hutchison
street, and when the woman got out of the
car she shook her fist at him-at six o'clock
in the morning.
Is there anybody here who will believe
anything of that kind? I certainly do not.
That is the reason why I made a minority
report and am undertaking to protect a
woman and a girl whom I dem to be just
as honourable and decent as the wife or
daughter of anyhody in this place. That is
ny judgment.
Now, go as far as you like when you pass
on my minority report, but again I savand we shall have something more about it
later-no single divorce case that bas been
litfore the Divorce Committee since I have
been a member of it has complied with the
rules laid down right here in the Senate. That
is all I have to say. and I shall h satisfied
with the decision of this body.

Hon. A. B. COPP: Honourable senators, a

debate of this kind is not one that anybody
desires to participate in. I have, unfortunately, been a member of the Divorce Committee
for a number of years. I have given its work
as strict attention as I could. I realize full
well that mistakes may be made. The Acting
Chairman says that the Divorce Committee
is a semi-judicial body. I differ with him.
I think it is a 100 per cent judicial body.
I have listened with a great deal of pleasure
to the dramatic effort of my honourable friend
from Parkdale. No member of the committee
has any objection whatever to the honourable
gentleman taking exception to the committee
report and filing his minority report. He may
be right in his interpretation of the evidence
as adduced. Like my honourable friend the
Acting Chairman, I did not hear all the witnesses, but I heard most of them, and I read
the evidence over as carefully as I could. At
the meeting when the committee decided the
case, irrespective of my feelings for the poor
woman whom my honourable friend defends
so ably, I could not help coming to the conclusion, on the evidence, that the committee
could do nothing else than approve the petition and so report to this House.
My honourable friend laid a good deal of
stress on the fact that this case has been standing from March 17 until the 21st of this
month. We all understand there is very good
reason for that apparent delay. The evidence

JULY 27, 1942
was long and conflicting, it took some time to
consider, and our decision was deferred from
time to time until the 15th of June.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: July.
Hon. Mr. COPP: Pardon me; the 15th of
June. The Senate adjourned until the 14th
of July, then the Chairman of the committee
was absent, and the case was held over so we
could give it better consideration. There was
similar delay in dealing with the second case
reported last week. My honourable friend did
not take exception to that case not having
been decided until the 21st of July. On the
contrary, he joined the other members of the
committee in the report.
Speaking for myself, I do not for one
moment contend that I never make mistakes
in the interpretation of evidence. It must be
realized that cases of this nature require very
serious consideration. I do not think we have
ever heard a defended case in which we were
not convinced that some of the witnesses were
committing perjury. Unfortunate as it may
be, from that evidence, perjured or not, we
have to come to the best conclusion we can
as to whether or not the petitioner has proven
his allegation of adultery.
I gave the present case, as I have given all
other cases, my best consideration, and after
taking everything into account I could not
help agreeing with the opinion of the majority
of the committee. My honourable friend from
Parkdale took the opposite view, and he was
perfectly at liberty to do so. I have no particular interest in this matter. It is for the
House to accept or reject the report, but I
want to state, in so far as I am able to speak
for the committee majority, that every member of it gave the case most careful consideration, and after long deliberation we came to
the conclusion that we could do nothing else
than report in favour of the petition.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: May I add a word?
My honourable friend-I know, in errorsaid he heard a part of this report. He was
not in town.
Hon. Mr. COPP: The report or the
evidence?
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Part of the evidence.
He was not in town.
Hon. Mr. COPP: I beg my honourable
friend's pardon. I did hear part of the
evidence.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Then the record
does not convey the information that the
honourable senator was here that day.
Hon. Mr. COPP: What day do you mean?
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: The 17th day of
March.
44567-18à

267

Hon. Mr. COPP: I was here and heard
part of the evidence.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: There were only
three members deputized to hear this caseSenator Robinson, Senator Haig and myself.
The other three members of the Divorce
Committee at that time were deputized to
deal with three other cases. They got through
them very soon, and as this Taffert case was
the last one on the list, I thought, before my
honourable friend made his statement, that
they were back on the job to hear the
evidence of Mrs. Taffert and her daughter;
but the record does not say my honourable
friend was here on the day the case was
heard.
Hon. Mr. COPP: The record is wrong. I
was here.
Hon. E. S. LITTLE: Honourable senators,
I think all this discussion is but another
argument in support of the view that this
foul mess ought to be taken away from
Parliament and placed in the courts, where
it belongs.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. LITTLE: I have on more than
one occasion stated that I dislike undue
publicity being given to divorce petitions,
and I rise now, not to add to that publicity,
but mercly to state, as a member of the
Divorce Committee who heard this case
with the exception of the testimony of the
first witness, and then at the request of the
Chairman, as a result of the minority report,
read over all the evidence, I support
the decision of the committee. I do not
think it is necessary to say anything further.
There is not much doubt that every member
of the Senate has during the last week or
ten days read the evidence and is able to
decide for herself or himself what should be
donc in regard to this report.
Hon. J. W. deB. FARRIS: Honourable
senators, there are some features of this case
to which 1, as a member of the Senate, attach
some importance. Whether divorce should
be dealt with by Parliament or by the courts
is a question not immediately before us. But
the fact is, as the honourable senator from
Westmorland (Hon. Mr. Copp) has said, we
are discharging, not a semi-judicial duty, but
essentially a 100 per cent judicial duty, the
same as the courts would do. As I see it,
when the matter comes before us we exercise
our powers of review, and I think we might
well be guided by the practice which our
appeal courts have adopted after long experience in that connection.
The first observation I make is on the
suggestion of an honourable member of that

268

SENATE

committee (Hon. Mr. Murdock), who was in
fact a judge for the time being, canvassing
either this court of review or the House of
Commons in regard to this particular case.
I do not know what the rule is, but I am sure
it would be wiser for a member who sat on
the trial to content himself with his minority
report and the statement he makes in this
House, and then allow the other members who
sit in review to decide on the merits.
In the second place, as to our functions
here, I would make this comment. When, the
other day, the honourable member from Parkdale spoke of his minority report, I got an
impression which now I do not think was
quite right. At that time I rather gathered
that the chain of identity depended on the
husband's testimony alone.
Of course, if
that were so, we should Le entitled to review
this exvidence and say it could not stand. But,
having read the evidence, I find that the testimony of the hsband on that point was corroborated not only by the one witness whose
evidence the Acting Chairman read to-day,
but also by the other detective. They said that
the lady who Lad been identified by the husband as his wife and whom they had seen in
this compromising situation was the same
lady
elion court and admittedly the wife of
in
the petitioner. So you have the evidence of
three or four persons, including the husband,
on the question of identity.
I hink my honourable friend rather weakens
his position when lie tests the evidence of the
dctectiveis in this case with the evidence of
detuctives in other cases. Anyone with long
expierience in the courts may be sceptical to
this extent, that lie appreciates that hired
procurers of evidence nay commit perjury;
but whcn le cornes to a particular case he
must judge the witnesses on their merits.
I liave no desire to review the evidence,
keeping in mind that most of the members of
the committee bad the advantage of seeing
the witnesses. Having perused that cvidence,
I -liouldbela
v
reluctati
to r fu-e
o accept
the
diiigmirt of tie majority of the court.
Hon. JOHN T. HAIG: Honourable senators,
I was present throughout the hearing of this
case. I adroit that I do not like the work
of the Divorce Committee, and that I am a
little prejudiced against the petitioner if there
are children involved in the case. And I am
a little prejudiced in favour of the wife where
she las been getting a separation allowance
from the petitioner. I try not to, but I do
go into court with some of that prejudice
still in my minid. If you look up the records
you will find frequently that when we refuse
a petition I am on the side of those members
Hon. Mr. FARRIS.

of the committee who would dismiss the
petition on the ground that the case bas not
been clearly established.
Now, having made that statement, I want
to say further that, from start to finish in this
case, there never was any doubt in my mind
as to the identity of the woman. There was
not the slightest doubt. In fact, if the Chairman of the committee were bere to-day be
would tell you that be just asked the questions
as to identity pro forma. It is always done
so that there may be no doubt. The solicitor
for the defendant did not raise any question
on -that point in lis cros-cxaminîation.
Now we come down, as the honourable
senator from Vancouver South (Hon. Mr.
Farris) las rightly said, to the matter of
judgment. I cannot tell you what makes a
man judge things in a certain way; but when
I hear the evidence of witnesses, lear their
cross-examination, and see their demeanour,
I coie to miy own conclusion as to who are
telling the truth.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Hear, hear. I ton.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: The only trouble with
the honourable senator is that Le hears the
first witness and is either for or against him
all the way through.
The other day we had a case in which three
witnesses said one thing and one witness said
another. I believed that the one witness was
telling the trutb and the others were not, and
I voted accordingly. We did not talk about
it, but eaci of us came to his own conclusion,
and we refused the divorce. The honourable
senator from Wellington (Hon. Mr. Howard)
was silniug on itt ci-i
n hil exrced
bis
own independent judgment.
In the case before us, if I Lad any prejudice
at all, it was in favour of the worman. I did
not like the situation. Nevertheless, after
hearing the whole of the evidence, I came
to the conclusion that there was absolutely no
doubt at ail either as to identity or any other
essential matter; and I am absolutely clear,
if I ever was clear on anything, that we should
grant the petition.
The motion was agreed to, on division.

NATIONAL RESOURCES MOBILIZATION
BILL
MOTION FOR SECOND READING

Hon. J. H. KING moved the second reading of Bill 80, an Act te amend the National
Resources Mobilization Act, 1940.
He said: Honourable senators, we have
before us to-day a Bill to amend the National
Resources Mobilization Act. That Act was
passed in June, 1940, and under it the Government was given very great powers. It
provides in section 2:
-the Governor in Council may do and authorize such acts and things, and make from time
te time such orders and regulations, requiring
persons to place themselves, their services and
their property at the disposal of His Majesty
in the right of Canada, as may be deemed
necessary or expedient for securing the public
safety, the defence of Canada, the maintenance
of public order, or the efficient prosecution of
the war, or for maintaining supplies or services
essential to the life of the community.
That enactment gave the Government the
right to take persons, their property or their
wealth, and to make use of them towards the
successful prosecution of the war. But the
first line of that section contains the following words:
Subject to the provisions of section three
hereof.
Section three of the Act reads as follows:
The powers conferred by the next preceding
section may not be exercised for the purpose
of requiring persons to serve in the military,
naval or air forces outside of Canada and the
territorial waters thereof.
The Government has now thought it wise to
amend this enactment so that whenever the
Government may think it expedient or necessary, our man-power can be utilized in the
armed forces of this country either within or
without the limits of Canada; in Great Britain
or anywhere else in the world.
It might be well to review briefly what the
Government has done under the Act passed in
1940. That Act was accepted by Parliament
without any very great objection that I know
of. Why? At that time Hitler had not only
overrun Austria, Czechoslovakia and Poland,
but had invaded Denmark, Norway, Belgium
and Holland, France had capitulated, and
the people of Canada were beginning to
realize

the seriousness

of the

war.

Great

26l

Britain was left alone with her Dominions to
carry on the battle against the foe. Parliament did not hesitate to give the Government
authority to make use of our man-power and
wealth as it thought best in order to carry on
the war. When Parliament was called together
in September of 1939 there was no question
as to whether Canada should join in the war
or not. His Majesty was advised that it was
the desire of the Canadian people to declare
war against Germany, and this was done.
Much water has run under the bridge since
then, and I think that we as Canadians may
to-day look with some gratification at what
has been accomplished by the efforts of the
people, Parliament and the Government, during the past three years.
We have succeeded in building up an armed
force, including the three services, of from
500,000 to 600,000 men. We have a number
of army divisions in Great Britain. Prime
Minister Churchill has spoken in glowing
terms, and in much better language than I
could hope to use, of the Canadian army in
Britain.

We know something of what has been done
in regard to the Naval Service. Starting from
scratch, we now have some 30,000 men in that
service, which is engaged not only in convoying ships between Canada and Great Britain,
but also in protecting our coasts and, more
recently, in co-operating wi-th the navies of the
Allied Nations in the protection of southern
Atlantie waters. Units of our navy are also
to be found in the northern Pacifie, where they
are co-operating with the American navy in
guarding the coast of British Columbia.
In addition to our military and naval forces,
we have developed, along with Great Britain,
Australia and New Zealand, one of the greatest
air training programmes in the world. This
is one of the bright spots in the war, and is
something of which I think we may well be
proud. The President of the United States
bas described Canada as the Airdrome of
Democracy in the world to-day. We learn
from day to day that men trained under this
plan are to be found on every battle front.
They have been in Russia and in Libya, they
have been in Ceylon-they are there yetand they are patrolling the coasts of Great
Britain and defending Britain itself. Night
after night squadron after squadron of Canadian airmen fly over Germany, inflicting such
damage as has never before been inflicted.
All these things which I have mentioned
have been accomplished during the last three
years, and I think Canadians may look upon
them with great pride, particularly when they
realize that between 400,000 and 500,000 of
these men volunteered for service.
What else have we done? We in Canada
have also carried on a very large industrial

270

SENATE

campaign in order to utilize the machinery
and other facilities of this country for the
making of munitions, tanks and all other
kinds of war equipment. At times we have
complained that our forces overseas and those
in training in this country have not had
sufficient guns or other equipment. That is
true. But war materials made in Canada have
been sent not only to Britain, but to virtually
every war front. We know that in the first
Libyan campaign it was the product of Canadian workshops that provided the transportation used by the British in their drive; we
know that the first tanks to arrive in Russsia
were Canadian-made, and we know that many
rifles manufactured in this country were
furnished to the British forces at Singapore,
and that much in the way of munitions is
still being sent to every part of the world
where the war is being carried on.
The Minister of Munitions some time ago
placed on Hansard figures which I think it
might be well to give to this House
He
estirnates that there are now 800,000 men and
women engaged in munitions plants throughout
Canada. He estimates that by the end of
this year 85,000 additional workers will be
required, and that early in 1943 there will be
a total of 910,000 persons employed, directly
or indirectly. There are now 120,000 women
engaged in war work, and 60,000 employed in
connection with our naval and shipbuilding
programme. In the production of tanks and
mechanical
transport 67,000
persons are
employed. One single plant constructed and
operated by the Government employs more
than 14,000 persons. War production and the
armed services have absorbed approximately
1,300,000 persons, and an additional 200,000
will be needed between now and the early
part of 1943.
In agriculture we find that,
exclusive of housewives, 1,350,000 persons are
employed.
In addition to all this, about
3,000,000 persons are necessary to carry on
essential industries in this country. So we
have arrived at the tine when the man-power
problem is extremely urgent.
I am sure it is the desire of the Canadian
people that we should maintain and strengthen
our armed forces as far as it is w-ithin our
power to do se. We have arrived at the stage
where at any time it may become necessary to
do what it has not been neccssary to do so
far, namely, to conscript men for overseas
service. So in the Speech from the Throne
delivered at the opening of this session the
Government stated it wished to be released
from a certain promise or pledge that had
been made during the 1940 election campaign.
That pledge, to the effect that there should
be no conscription for overseas service, was
Hon. Mr. KING.

made not alone by members of the Government, for a similar pledge was made by the
leaders of every party. Many people may
say, and some do, that such a pledge made in
an election campaign should not be regarded
as binding now. But I have always contended,
and I think it should be contended, that a
pledge of that character was a personal pledge,
made to each man personally in this country.
It was not an ordinary kind of promise such
as is frequently made in an election campaign.
A direct pledge was made to each and every
citizen.
I think the Prime Minister was
correct in t.aking the stand that owing to
the exigencies of war, to the serions war situation all over the world. the Government
should be released from its pledge. Means
were taken to obtain the necessary release
through a plebiscite, the result of which is
well known.
The majority of our citizens
voted to release the Government from its
pledge. and in doing so they released not only
the Government, but all members of Parliament who had made a similar pledge in the
campaign.

We know what happened in the United
States. In 1940 a good nany Anericans were
in favour of war against Gernany, and I
think tiat if the hands of the Prcsident had
not been tied he probably would have declared
war in that year; but the influence of the
large group of people known as isolationists
was sufficient to stay the hand of the Government. It is true that after Great Britain and
France declared war against Germany certain
American regulations prohibiting the giving of
assistance to belligerents in war time were
modified so that the Allies could purchase
munitions and, other war materials in the
United States.
But I think it w-as after
France capitulated that the American people
first realized how very serious the war was
for them. Congress then passed the LendLease Act, under which war materials were
purchasable by the Allies on credit. That in
itself was a great help. However, there still
was a large body of public opinion in the
United States opposed to the sending of
Americans abroad to engage in war. According to that school of thought the best way of
defending the United States was to keep its
army at home.
That was how things stood until December 7,
1941, when the Japanese. who for years had
been planning and waiting for a suitable
occasion, struck out of the night at Pearl
Harbour.
What was the reaction in the
United States within the next few days? There
was ne delay.
The American Government
declared war not only on Japan, but also on
Germany and Italy and their allies. And

JULY 27, 1942
did the American people -then say, "We will
remain in the United States and1 figlit off the
invader"? No. Stops were immediately taken
to send American armed forces to. those portions of the earth. where -they could render the
m-ost valuable service in fighting their
focs. To-day large bodies of American soldiers
are in Great Britain, Ireland, Australia and
Libya, and in ail probability some are in
Russia. Why have they go-ne there? Not to
prote-ot those countries. They have gone
there to proteet the United States. They
believed that by going wbere the enemy hud
already taken the war they would be more
effective in pro tecting their o:wn country.
In the light of the American experience,
surely in recent weeks we in Canada have had
sufficient warning to adopt, as a people, a differont perspective. We cannot afford to go
back in our minds to the political contest of
1911, which caused some disturbances and left
some sores. We cannot go back to 1917, when
the Military Service Act was put inta effect.
It was a different; story at that time, and
mucli water bas gone under the bridge since.
We must be realistic and face conditions as
they are to-day.
It is true the Government has been sending
our volunteer troops to many parts of the
world. Canadians have been on active service
in the West Indies, in Hong Kong, in Iceland,
in Newfoundland and Great Britain. As 1
have already stated, our airmen are ail over
the world to-day. There can be no doubt in
the minds of Canadians that we, with our
powerful Allies, are now engaged in a world
struggle, flot to conquer new lands, 'but ta
maintain our freedom against savagery and
domination which the Germans, claiming to
be supermen, feel Vhey bave the riglit ta
impose upon us.
If that is the situation, why should there
be any great hesitation over this Bill ta amend
the Mobîlization Act of 1940? A great doal
of good lias been accomplished under the
Act. We are more fortunate than was the
Governinont in 1917, when it foît the need ta
bring in a conscription measure, for under this
Act some 13,000 mon known as one-month
trainees and some 23,000 kn.own as fourmonth trainees have been brouglit into the
Canadian army, and within the next three or
four months the number wil'l have risen ta
100,000. The Act has had a very important
rosuit in that it bas creatod a large reservoir
of trained men, many of wham after a relatively brief experience in the army have expressed their desire ta volunteer for overseas
service. I believe the porcentage of sucd.
volunteers is somewhere 'between thirty and
forty.

271

A suggestion bas been made-I do not know
whether thore is any truth in it or not-that
pressure bas been oxerted ini some quarters ta
compel volunteers ta enlist for active service
abroad. If that is sa, it has been a trexnendous
blunder. I am of the opinion that capable,
officers could easily make clear in a proper
way, ta the young mon under their charge, the
desirability of their doing Vheir aIl ta help
defeat the enemy.
I do not wish ta prolong the discussion.
The Bill was debated at considerable length,
not only in another place, but in the Press
througbout Canada. The debato in another
place was carried on in good tempor, I think,
and in the general hope that the difference of
opinion about the measure must not ho permitted ta result in national disunity. I was
pleased witb the Hon. Mr. Cardin's speech
of a few niglits aga. He lias very strong
views, but in concluding bis addross lie pointed
out that the majority of the people expressed
their dosire ta release the Government from
ifs pledge not to bring in conscription for overseas service, that the will of the maj ority must
evontually prevail, and that if the Government
found it expedient or necessary ta conscript
mon for overseas service bis province, Quebec,
would accept the law enacted by the Canadian
Parliament. That boing so, sbould we ahl nat
approacli this question thoughtfully and carefully? After aIl, as I have stated, this is no
ordinary war ini whicb we are engaged. The
United Nations are not seeking canquest, nor
are they fighting merely ta preserve their own
lands. Our abject is, by the use of ail the
power and resources we bave, ta Bave the
liberty we prize s0 bighly.
Hon. C. C. BALLANTYNE: Honourable
senators, it is a remarkaýble coincidenee that
exactly twenty-five years ago to the day this
House had under review the Military Service
Act, theoabject of wbicli was the pu'tting into
effect of conscription by a Conservative
Government under Sir Robert Borden. Ta-day
we bave before us a Bill ta amend the
National Resources Mobilization Act of 1940.
No do-ubt honourable senators realize, as I do,
that wlien this amending Bill is carried and
Royal Assent is obtaîned, conscription by
the present Liberal Government, under the
Riglit Hon. Mackenzie King, will be -the law
of Canada. I for one certainly have no
objection ta that. When I was speaking for
bonourable members on this side of the
buse on the Address in Reply ta thie Speech
from the Throno, I expressed our objection ta
tbe plebiscite. The objection we made st
that time bas been fully justified by the
unfortunate result of the plebiscite. In my
opinion the voters of this country paid very

SENATE
little if any attention to the argument of the
Prime Minister and his followers, that while
under the War Measures Act he had the
legal right to bring into effect compulsory
service for Canada and overseas, he was
under a moral obligation to the people because

of a commitment he had made to them, and
he was applying for release from that commitment. I for one am satisfied that those
who voted Yes-the majority-voted for conpulsory service, and that those who voted No
were against compulsory service.
We are now at a stage of the war almost as
critical as that at the time of the Battle of
Britain after the collapse of France. Our
Army, Navy and Air Force are at this moment
putting up a terrific battle on the hot sands
of Libya to hold on to Egypt, the Suez canal
and the Mediterranean, and our gallant Allies,
the Russians, are being rolled back across the
Don. And our shipping losses are certainly
serious. I believe the people of Canada will
be bitterly disappointed that this Government
does not intend immediately to bring in
compulsory service for overseas. The Prime
Minister and his followers state that they
are prepared to do so when it becomes necessary, but not now. If the present state of the
war, which I have only briefly touched on, is
not sufficiently serious te prevail upon the
Prime Minister and his colleagues to make an
all-out effort, then I do not know what will.
Parliament will adjourn in a few days. The
Prime Minister states that if ever he finds
the situation se acute that compulsory service
is necessary, he will prepare an Order in
Council under the War Measures Act and
ask the Commons for a vote of confidence.
When will he decide that the time is necessary? When will he summon the House of
Commons?
All these delays, especially at
this critical heur, are worrying the majority
of the Canadian people. They want bold,
quick action now.
The Prime Minister has also made the
remarkable statement that under the voluntary system we are getting all the volunteers
we require.
The voluntary enlistments in
both the Air Force and the Navy have been
satisfactory, I am sure. But when we come
to the Army the situation is different. I shall
confine my remarks exclusively to the Army,
for, notwithstanding the wonderful service of
the Air arm and the Navy, the final devastating battle will be fought and won on
European soil. Therefore this Government,
and especially the senior Minister of National
Defence, must maintain a sufficient number
of reserves in England to keep our present
Army corps, which I am confident is a very
efficient one, up to strength.
Hon, Mr. BALLANTYNE.

I have read what the senior Minister of
National Defence has stated in the House of
Commons and elsewhere about our Army. He
says we have in England three infantry divisions, which would be about 50,000 men. We
have a tank brigade or a tanks corps-I do net
know which is the correct title. I am not
sure what the strength of that would be.
The mechanized division, the fourth, so far
as I know, bas not left this country yet. Let
us suppose that the Fourth Division bas
arrived overseas. What is the total strength
of our Army in England, our fighting force
that will go across the channel and fight with
our Allies for the victory which we are sure
to gain? It cannot be more than 75,000 or
80.000 men. Military experts tell me that
you require frem 50,000 to 75,000 reserves, and
that these should be not here, but across the
ocean. Maybe we have from 50,000 to 75,000
reserves in England; I am sure the Government leader will never tell us the exact number; but without trying to be unfair to the
Government, I do not think we have.
Then there is another thing. Parliament
and the public have never been told the
number of voluntary
enlistnents in the
Army. You pick up a paper and read that
such and such a number of men have joined
the armed forces of Canada.
No doubt
correct, but the enlistments are amalgamated.
What Parliament and the country are desirous
of knowing is ho- many voluntary enlistments
there have been in the Army since war broke
out, and how many we are getting now.
I make this statement, and it cannot be
cballenged by either the Prime Minister or
any of his .colleagues: voluntary enlistment
for the Army has broken down, just as it did
in the last war from 1916 to 1917. There
is not a commanding officer in Canada to-day
who can raise an infantry battalion under the
voluntary systcm and bring it to full establishment, which is about 900 men. The Minister failed in his attempt to get d.ivisional
commanders to raise undier the voluntary
system two divisions for overseas. Therefore
I urge my friend the honourable leader
opposite, and the Covernment, to lose no
more time, but to put compulsory service
into operation for overseas forthwith, net
only in order that we may keep our Army
corps up te strength, but also that Canada,
as one of the independent Dominions within
the British Commonwealth of Nations, may
take its proper iplace with our Allies who
are fighting so gallantly with us.
I want to pass to another subject: manpower. In my view the Government could
not possibly have an accurate registration of
manpower, and I shall give my reasons for

JULY 27, 1942
coming to that conclusion. There was a
registration of man-power taken in 1940. I
understand it was not very efficiently handled
here, but I do not know whether that is
true or not. Be that as it may, that registration of man-power two years ago cannot be,
and is net, up to date. What followed then?
The census. Well, if the experience of others
with regard to census-takers was similar to
mine, they would not attach much importance
to the accuracy of manpower figures thereby
obtained. Unemployed men from 16 to 69
were given ample notice to register. What
happened in my city? A lot of men took temporary jobs and never registered at all. One
indignant man told me: "I am 63. I had to
register, but the man who cuts my grass and is
many years my junior did not have to register
at all." Therefore I may be permitted te
urge the Government to take a new registration of man-power. It could be dono within
a comparatively short time. While the registration is under way, why not also register
women from 20 to 40 years of age? I make
bold to offer another suggestion. Why should
we not have a strong, able man in absolute
charge of man-power? Instead of the Navy,
the Air Force, the Army, and the Munitions
Ministers each asking for men, why not do
as our neighbours to the south, who have
appointed Mr. Paul McNutt to deal with
their manpower problem. If we had a man
in charge of man-power to sit in with the
Ministers of the armed services and munitions, he would say, "These men are available
for the armed services, and these for munitions," as the case might he. Surely we ought
to have co-operation and co-ordination, and
I think honourable senators will agree with
me that we have not now.
My spirits went up a little when I was listening to my good friend the leader of the
House. He got very, very close to saying
that the Government was going to put conscription in at once, but he hesitated at the
brink and did not go so far.
I have no political motives in speaking as
I have done. I have a long lapse of years
behind me. I have prospered in this country.
I was born and brought up a Canadian and
am proud of it. I am proud also that Canada
is an integral part of what is known as the
British Commonwealth of Nations. Sufficient
credit has not been given to the great effort
the United Kingdom has made in this war.
Sometimes we are asked: "What is wrong
with the British generals? What is wrong
with the British Army?" There is nothing
wrong with the British Army at all. As we
know, they have had to retrea-t from certain
occupied countries, and in Libya, but no
finer generals or soldiers tread the face of

213

the earth than those that compose the British
Army. England has always given prominence
and credit to the efforts of the Dominions. I
do not find any fault with her for that. When
you pick up the paper at night you will read
that the South Africans or the Australians
did so and so in Egypt, and, as was the case
in the last war, the efforts of the Imperials
are kept in the background.
The leader of the Government spoke, and
very properly so, about the important part
played by Canadian airmen in the war. I
saw the statement the other day that 23 per
cent, I think it was, of the Air Force in the
United Kingdom came from Canada, and the
rest were Imperials. Words of mine will not
carry very great weight, but I should like to
say to the men who are younger than I am,
that since Canada has been British territory
England has done much for us and has spent
huge sums of money. This, combined with
our own efforts, has given us a country te be
admired. Our future is linked up with England, and it would be a sorry day for us if
we ever eut the painter, for then Canada
would be but a puppet state, and we should
lose all the rights and privileges we have
enjoyed under the British flag.
I will close by expressing the sentiment
voiced by Sir John Macdonald, with which
you are all familiar: "A British subject I
was born, and a British subject I will die,"
and I shall couple with that the patriotie and
eloquent utterance of Sir Wilfrid Laurier,
who said that Canada was the brightest gem
in the galaxy of nations known as the British
Empire.
I think I have kept away from controversial
subjects. I could have said m-uch about the
last twenty-five years in the political field,
but I passed that by. I want to join with
all honourable senators in urging our Canadian people to stand shoulder to shoulder,
with the rest of our Allies, until victory is
attained.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Sir THOMAS CHAPAIS: Honourable senators, before coming directly to the
Bill whieh is now before us, may I be allowed
to indulge briefly in a personal remembrance?
I know that, to use the words of a great
French writer, "Le moi est haissable,"-self
is hateful-and I beg the forbearance of my
colleagues.
Twenty-five years ago a Bill which had the
same purpose as the one we are now debating
was presented to this House. I had not then
the privilege of sitting here, but my esteemed
leader, Sir Robert Borden, had been kind
enough to offer me a seat in the Senate.' I

SENATE

2ï4

felt obliged to refuse the proffered honour, because my conviction was such that I could net
conscientiously support that Bill.
Here is a Bill of the saine kind, and I
must declare that I feel bound toý take the
saine stand as I did twenty-five years ago.
Now, as then, I am against conscription. I
am against conscription for three reasons:
first, because I honestly believe that it is not
needed; second, because I believe that it
would be inefficacious; and third, because I
am convinced that it would be against the
national interest.
I think that conscription is not needed.
If we can rely on the figures given to the
publie and to this Parliament, Canada has
already provided more than 500,000 men for
the arn-ed services, and under the present
plan this figure will be increased by approxiinately 100,000 before the end of the fiscal
year. Rcntlv a Minister of the Crown,
the ionourable the Minister of Agriculture,
made tlic following statement:
Tlieie aie somtething over 600.000 men up to
the end of the present fiscal year. and 750,000

wxould provide us with the necessary troops to

carry ou during a three-v3ear period of time. if
the troops at the front were in action. Under

these circutmstances we have the 1 ossibility of
carrying out in Canada the present policy in
relation to the ariy, without conscription.

Another statement. this time frein the
ionourable the Minister of War Services,
gives us this information:
Vomiitar einlistments for the Arrny, Navy

and Air Force up to the end of the thirtvthird mionth of the presetit wae totalled 505,574,
not iiti-liiIg

y enlistients

for the Nav,

and with the figures for the Air Force not
îjuite coiplete for May.
According to these figures the voluntary
systen has already provided more than half
a million men for our Army, Air Force and
Navy. And enlistments are continuing. The
voluntary systei is surely doing well, and we
should bear in mind the fact that it gives
to the arned forces of this country a far
better quality of soldiers than conscription
would tIo. I readily subscribe te the assertion
that
A[ servic-es requiiring special skill and initiatie
cati best he perforied b.v voilnteers.
Ctonscription wou h iln t iiiake for as effective an

arimy as the Canadiai overseas army is at the
present time.
The foregoing figures and statements lead,
surely, te the following conclusion, for which
the honourable the Minister of War Services
is also responsible:
As a mîatter of fact we are mîuch closer to

the total mnobilization of our man-power reserves
than maost persons would imagine. Over 500,000
men have enlisted voluntarily for service overseas mn our aried forces. In addition ire
have raised over 56.000 men for active service
Hon. Sir Thomas CHAPAIS.

in Canada, for the duration of the war. Over
800,000 persons are engaged in war industry,
and about 1,350,000 men are engaged in agriculture . . . The supply of man-power in Canada
is not unlimited. For the last year we have
added approximately 20,000 men a month te
our armed forces . . . Since the beginning of
the war, war industry has been adding 28,000
persons a mtonth to war production.
The
nonthly leduction of persons from the production of the nation cannot continue indefinitely.
for the supply of nan-power is definitely
ljumited.
It seems undeniable that, without compulsion, voluntary enlistment can provide
over 700,000 men for our Canadian Army. Add
to that number the 800,000 people engaged
in war industry, and you have a total of
one million and a half of our people devoted
te war. Out of a total population of about
eleven millions and a half, I think that is a
very big proportion. I therefore contend that
the enactment of compulsory military service
for overseas is net needed, and I now add
that, even if it were needed, if would be
thoroughly inefficacious.
To enforce a law for compulsory service
involves a complicated procedure, difficulties
of all kinds, large expenditures, ugly cases of
bribery, and very poor results. We had a sad
experience of all that in 1917. The conscription policy of the Canadian Government in
that ycar was an immense fiasco.
When
Sir Robert Borden introduced that legislation
some time in the spring of 1917, he said:
We imust have 70,000 more men by
i)eceeiîur 31.
Well, how maany had been enlisted at that
date? Only 7,000. Four hundred thousand
and four men had been called, and there were
383,000 applications for exemption.
These
facts are recorded in a book written by a man
of the highest reputation, the late Dr. Oscar
Skelton, for many years Under Secretary of
State for External Affairs. In that book,
entitled "Life and Letters of Sir Wilfrid
Laurier,'' we rend the following lines:
No effort or expense was spared in its enforcemont-

That is the conscription law.
A huge administrative staff was set up, eaci
office wxith its full equipment of shining desks
and elaborate files; forms, instructions and
regulations rained from the Printing Bureau:
iedical officers and reviewing boards, local
tribunals. appeal courts, and a central appeal
judge were appointed, wxith militia representatives to check exemptions, and police were enrolled to round up defaulters. In Quebec, as
elsewhere, once the issue was decided at the
polls, the Act was accepted, and its operation
given full scope. Yet the legions promised did
not appear. The first shock to the sanguine
supporters of the Act came when it was found
that of the 404,000 first-class, unmarried men

from twenty to thirty-four, who bad registered,
by the end of 1917, 380,000 had claimed exemp-

JULY 27, 1942
tion. The next shock came with the announcement that there were 118,000 claims for exemption from Ontario, as against 115,000 from
Quebec.
By March 31, 1918, the net yield was less
than 26,000. To use the terms employed by
the Montreal Gazette at that time:
The spectacle offered by the operation of the
draft system has not been encouraging.
In the face of such a poor result the
Government took the bold decision of cancelling all exemptions regularly granted ta
men of twenty, twenty-one and twenty-two
At last, by the end of
years of age.
November, 1918, the total actual yield was
61,000 men; but the war was over; and it
bas been stated that during the same period
101.000 men enlisted voluntarily.
Sir Wilfrid Laurier surely foresaw such a
result when he wrote at that time the following
lines:
How many men will conscription bring in?
Just a few slackers, exactly the same as in

infinitesimal number, so that the actual figures
have never been given to the public. Sir John
Simon was supremely right, but Northcliffe and
Carson and Toryism insisted and won their
point, but won nothing else. It will he the
same here: the number of men who can he

infinitesimally small.
Later on Sir Wilfrid was able ta write this:
The conscription measure was introduced in

that many, have
thousand men, if indeed half
been brought into the ranks by this measure.
By next June you will not have one conseripted man across the ocean, and I doubt if
you will have any number by the first of
January next.
Honourable members, history often repeats
itself. It would not be very hazardous ta assert that in 1942 we shall have ta face the
same difficulties, the same hateful complications and the same paltry results. Even if a
compulsory war service law could meet with
some success, it surely could not achieve a
result of such magnitude as ta be a really
telling asset in the gigantic struggle, in which
millions are desperately clashing every day in
the Old World. Quoting the question put some
time ago by our Minister of War Services, I
ask: "Would not the additional army so raised
by Canada be relatively small in comparison
with the vast armies now engaged in the war;
and would that not be a relatively small contribution to victory, as compared with the
potential production which would be lost?"
At the present moment our Allies urgently
need weapons rather than men. Remember
Mr. Churchill's word, "Give us the tools and
we shall finish the job." And, with the weapons,

275

food is urgently needed. Let us ponder over
these lines published three months ago by an
English journal:
Food is for us the crux of the war . . . Our

farmers cannot produce enough food for our
own people; yet we are feeding armies of
Canadian and American soldiers we have
shipped here. These soldiers hamper our war
effort by needing extra food cargoes . . . Our

ships ought to bring raw materials and food
instead of bringing hearty-eating Canadians
and Americans . . . It would greatly help our
war effort if all Canadian and American
soldiers here were sent back to Canada and
America.
That was written on the 23rd of April this
year.
I dare say that my second reason for opposing this Bill, namely, its lack of efficiency,
stands on pretty solid ground. I now come ta
my third reason. I firmly believe the proposed
legislation is detrimental ta our national
interest. Compulsion for military service has
been a boae of contention in our country as
well as in other countries. Wheh enacted for
the defence of the native land it is accepted
as a sacred duty. This is our case at the
present moment. Conscription for military
service in Canada has been in force here for
more than two years. No dissenting voice has
been heard on that account during the last
thirty months. But compulsion for overseas
service-in Europe, in Africa, in Asia, at the
Antipodes, at the other end of the world-is a
different thing. It bas formerly aroused and it
now meets again with a strong opposition.
This should cause no surprise. For more than
one hundred and fifty years the policy of no
service outside Canada has been followed. If
you lay your hand on the old statutes of
Lower Canada you will find that in 1796 what
was probably our first militia law was adopted,
and you will read therein the following section:
And be it further enacted by the authority
aforesaid, that it shall and may be lawful for
the Governor, Lieutenant Governor or person
administering his Majesty's Government in this
Province for the time being to form the Militia
called out under the authority of this Act, ikito
regiments, battalions or companies, in such
manner as he in his discretion shall think
proper, and under the command of such officers
as he shall appoint, and them to march ta and
from such place or places, and in such manner
as to him or to the officers whom he shall for
that purpose appoint, may appear necessary.
Provided always that no part of the Militia
called out and embodied under the authority of
this Act, shall march out of the Province,
except for the assistance of the Province of
Upper Canada, in case the same shall he
actually invaded or in imminent danger thereof,
and except in pursuit of an enemy who may
have invaded this Province . . .
And sa on.
A few years later a similar law was adopted
in Upper Canada. And that principle of no

276

SENATE

compulsion for military service outside Our
country was to be followed always as a standing enactment. Nobody could be surprised
at that. It was absolutely consonant with the
British mind. Freedom has always been the
main passion of the English nation, and compulsion has always been hateful to the free
men of England. The strong feeling against
coercion asserted itself mightily in 1916, when
the Asquith Government reluctantly introduced a conscription Bill. The Prime Minister
himsef voiced that feeling. A few weeks
before presenting the Bill he had said:
My proposition is that compulsion, if resorted
to, ought only to be resorted to, and can only
from a practical point of view-or, in other
words, be made a workable expedient for filling
up the gap which you have to supply-with
something in the nature of general consent.

Later on Mr. Asquith stated that there were
differeoces of opinion among the members of
the Cabinet. And even when introducing a
Bill enacting a modified forn of conscription,
he said:
I am of opinion that no case bas been made
out for general compulsion. I. at any rate.
would be no party to a measure which bad
that for its object.

Notwithstanding its modified form the Bill
gave rise to a ministerial crisis. The Home
Secretary. Sir John Simon, went ont of the
Goveroment and said in the debate that
followed:

I confess te having regarded the voluntary
system as a vital principle of national life.
The ensuing discussion was very bitter, as
can bc seen when one reads the following
words of the Right Hon. J. H. Thomas:
I resent to the full the suggestion that has
been already made, that those who are likely
to oppose this are not in faveur of winning the
war. Not only are they in favour of winning
the war, but they genuinely believe that the
course they adopt is the best course in the
interest of winning the war. Therefore I do
net think it will help matters to hurl charges
of that kind.

The strong opposition against conscription
in England during the Great War of 1914-1918
was in accordance with the old popular feeling, the principle of compulsion being absolutely un-Britisi.
It is this sane popular feeling which now
prevails in the peovince of Quebc. But it
should not be inferred therefrom that Quebec,
to use the words of the Right Hon. Mr.
Thomas, is "net in favour of winning the
war." To make such assertion would be to
misunderstand the situation utterly. At the
present moment there are in this country
different states of mind as to the participation
of Canada in the world struggle. Some people
deem and argue that our country has absolutely nothing to do with the conflicts of the
Hon. Sir Thomas CHAPAIS.

Old World. They maintain that we should
always kcep aloof, and, as they say, mind our
own business. Utter abstention is their watchword. They have bren "isolationists."
There is another class of persons who assert
that it is Canada's duty to take an active
part in the deadly conflict which is shaking
the foundations of the eastern hemisphere.
According to their views, we should net only
help, but we should rashly throw ourselves
into the terrifie maelstrom, we should even
go beyond the limits of our strength and
resources. This is what they call "total war."
What really is total war?
As Las been
asked in another place:
Does it mean squeezing the last possible
mau out of the population and putting hin in
uniforn. or coes it mean inaking the iaximum

war effort by a balanced distribution of manpower between the armed services, on the one
hand. and, on the other, agriculture, war
industry and civilian occupation?

We may weil put that question to ourselves.
Perhaps we may also put the question in

another form. Snatching from the limited
virile population of Canada 700,000 nien, for
the purpose of sending them towards remote
and bloody battle-fields, is that not total war?
Enrolling 800,000, perhaps 1,000,000, men and
women of Canada, heretofore busy in peaceful pursuits, and putting them to work. often
day and night, for the production of deadly
tools, is that not total war?
Raising the
public debt of Canada within three years
from three to five billions of dollars, is that
not total war? Increasing our war expenditure
within three years from $127,000,000 to $1,394,000,000, is that not total war? Making
the Canadian people stagger and pant under
the crushing load of enormous and always
increasing taxes, is that not total war? Perhaps in the minds of some people total war
means bankruptcy of men and bankruptcy
of money. That would probably be total war,
but it would surely be total wreck.
Coming back to the different states of mind
towards our participation in old-world conflicts, I hasten to say that there is a middle
one. Large numbers of good Canadian citizens, deeply devoted to the welfare and the
good nane of their country, deem Canada
could not possibly stand aside in 'this tragic
emergency.
They are conscious that the
present war, even more clearly than the preceding one, is not what is usually called an
imperialistic war, is not a war to serve
ambitiou designs of lust and conquest, but
that it is a defensive war, a war whose supreme
aim is to save the world from the hateful

of all other nations under the odious yoke of
the Teutonic and anti-Christian Empire. I

JULY 27, 1942
do not like to use the stereetyped slogan,
"We are fighting to save democracy." We are
fighting for a higher aim; we are fighting to
save human freedom and what remains of
Christian liberty.
The crowds of good Canadians whose feelings I am now trying to translate faithfully
therefore deem that Canada is serving a good
cause when helping England, the United
States and those who side with these two great
nations, to stem the mighty and destructive
tide of Nazi-ism. But in the meantime they
hold that there is some difference, some disparity between our duties, our responsibilities,
our obligations, and the duties, the responsibilities, the obligations of the nations directly
threatened, who are desperately fighting with
a treacherous enemy, and for whom the event
of the fierce struggle is death or life. They
say that Canada has no direct interest in
European problems, that they are going too
far who assert that our collaboration should
be as intensive as-let us sy-the superhuman
strain on Great Britain. And they maintain
that our present effort, our heavy sacrifices,
our weighty obligations, our accepted responsibilities, are perhaps exceeding the claim of
our national duty. However, they sincerely
remain pro-Ally. They simply say that we
should keep a sense of proportion.
This state of mind that I have tried to
expound was described most happily by the
Prime Minister, Mr. Mackenzie King, two
years ago. Here is his felicitous analysis:
Canada, it is contended, is not a country of
unlimited powers; it bas not the capacity to
stand indefinite strain. We have tremendous
tasks to do at home in housing the people, in
caring for the aged and helpless, in relieving
drought and unemployment, in building roads,
in meeting our heavy burdens of debt, in
making provision for Canada's defence, and in
bringing our standard of living and civilization
to the levels our knowledge now makes possible.
There is no great margin of realizable wealth
for this purpose; we must, to a greater or less
extent, choose between keeping our bouse in
order, and trying to save Europe and Asia.
The idea that every twenty years this country
should automatically and as a matter of course
take part in a war overseas for democracy or
self -determination of other small nations, that
a country which bas all it can do to run itself
should feel called upon to save periodically a
continent that cannot save itself, and to these
ends risk bankruptey and political disunion,
seems to many a nightmare and sheer madness.
This very clear outline may shed some light
on the feeling which is extant in the province
of Quebec, and in other provinces also, at the
present moment. Such a feeling is likely to
clash with that of the totalitarians. It is that
clash which the Minister of National Defence
in 1941 urged us so strongly to avoid, in the
following terms:
If the method which has been suggested
were adopted, it would be a method different
from what the Commonwealth of Australia has

277

adopted. I point out that this country, in
1917, was seared, was divided by the very issue
which is mentioned. We have unity in this
country. Let us try to preserve it rather than
attempting to drive a wedge of disunion into a
war effort of which I think Canada ought well
to be proud. I deprecate in public men and in
others the attitude of advocating something
different for which no need has been established, because I believe it interferes with our
war effort.
Such words should have special weight
to-day. They strongly uphold my third reason
for opposing the Bill, namely, that it seems
to me detrimental to the national interest.
Honourable members, I have tried to explain
on what ground is based the opposition of
many of those who cannot accept the present
Bill. I have no right to speak in the name
of my native province, but I do believe that
the feeling therein is adverse to this Bill:
that this piece of legislation is not needed, that
even if it were needed it would be useless, and,
at all events, that it would be contrary to the
national interest. Such is, if I am not mistaken, the general state of mind in Quebee.
But this does not mean that the province is
lacking in patriotism, in spirit of sacrifice, in
the stubborn will to help the cause of freedom
and to assume her due share in the common
effort towards victory.
Those are not vain words. Quebec can show
facts. Thousands of lier sons have freely
enlisted, notwithstanding unavoidable impediments like the difference of tongue, and others.
The citizens of that province subscribe earnestly to war loans, buy constantly war certificates, accept most willingly all restrictions
and regulations. And all this is done in a
spirit of duty; peThaps more meritorious in
her case than in others, for she has less
European links than other provinces. She is
purely Canadian. She is the most Canadian
province of our Confederation. She has behind
her three centuries of American history.
Montreal, ber great metropolis, has just passed
the threshold of her fourth century. And my
old city of Quebec could lately have celebrated
her three hundred and thirty-sixth birthday.
But the province of Quebec is not chained to
her past. She feels the beating pulse of the
present emergency. She shares the anxieties,
the fears, the hopes, the passionate will of the
nations fighting for the liberation of the world.
In lier churches lier people offer up to the
Almighty this ardent supplication for victory
and peace:
We humbly pray Thee, O God of Mercy, to
have pity on us and to give us victory. Give
to humanity the victory of right over might,
the victory of justice over injustice, the victory
of charity over egotism, the victory of Thy
divine rights over sacrilegious usurpations.

SENATE
And always, on every Sunday, before the Host
enthroned on the altar, we hear the beautiful
anthem: "Domine Salvum Fac Regem,"that is to say, "God Save the King." At the
present moment these words have a wider
meaning than ever before. God Save the
King! Yes, God save the noble prince who is
the worthy head of this commonwealth of
nations! God save England! God save our
poor France! God save our beloved country,
our dear Canada!
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. C. P. BEAUBIEN: Honourable senators, it is not amiss, perhaps, that two voices
in succession should be heard from this side of
the House, particularly with respect to a subject on which they must be absolutely discordant. I need not say that I have for my
honourable friend from Grandville (Hon. Sir
Thomas Chapais) a very deep admiration. I
have followed his career since my youth, and
I know that he has been accepted, without
contradiction by anybody, as one of our greatest historians and one of our greatest orators.
But while listening to him a moment ago I
thought of what had been said about France by
a certain author-that France was often lost
through her eloquence. That is terribly true.
I do not want to follow my honourable
friend stop by step in his argument. I do not
think it is necessary to do se. What is needed
from Canada now is, not words, even though
they may be marvellously eloquent, but deeds.
We shall not defeat the enemy with wonderful
speeches.
The honourable gentleman says that Great
Britain has always been in favour of liberty.
Yes, she has; but she has always been in
favour of justice too; and one of the main
reasons why the Conservative party-to which
I am proud to belong-enacted conscription in
1917 was justice. I have never heard a refutation of the argument that it is unfair that the
entire burden of war should be borne by those
citizens who are patriotic and devoted. Is it
fair, or is it required by any law of nature, that
one man should pass on to another, for
defence, his home, his family and all that is
dear to him? I say that is contrary to the
fundamental law of nature. Every man, if he
is a man, is obliged to defend his home and
his children. Shall we allow our boys to go
overseas, to die if necessary, on the battlefield, with the vision before them of other boys,
like themselves good and strong, tucked away
at home in more comfortable, happier and
more prosperous conditions than ever before?
Is that justice? Are you going to claim in the
name of liberty that there should be no conscription? What about justice? I say that
Hon. Sir Thomas CHAPAIS.

if you have different rules for different people
in the land, so that one does his duty fully,
even to the supreme sacrifice, while another
stays at home, you will have in this country a
rancour that nothing will obliterate. It will
divide no t only the provinces and the races,
but unhappily it will divide families. In that
way you will divide brother from brother, because one thing that will not be downed is
justice.
My honourable friend said: "Look at Great
Britain! I will quote Asquith for the House."
Do I need to have any authority quoted for
me?
Not at all. What system has Great
Britain to-day, and why? The British people
have always been opposed to conscription.
Why is Britain so different from the continental nations? The continental nations, which
are so frequently visited by war, have always
had conscription. For what reason? It was
that they bad learned its necessity; they had
learned that the people would not stand for
one rule for one man and a different rule for
another. Great Britain, on the other hand,
very rarely sent troops across the channel.
As you know, she frequently paid her allies
on the Continent to fight for her there. She
did not require conscription. She continued
to manufacture and to export, and by this
means she was able to buy the armies that she
needed in Europe. That was the reason why
Britain did not have conscription.
My dear old friend-and I love him-said
that to-day everything must be in proportion.
He said we were a young country, we were not
rich, we had not an enormous population. That
is true, but when he says everything must be
in proportion, I ask: In proportion to what?
Answer that question, you who listen to me.
Did we ever in this world have a war that
approached this one in any way? Was there
ever a menace to our country equal to the
menace of to-day? Let any fair-minded man
answer me. I say never, and I ask: What is our
choice? What is to be our fate if we lose?
That is the only important question. One does
not need to be very eloquent to answer. Are
we prepared to make sacrifices of so much,
for so long as is necessary to win the waryes or no? That is all there is to it. I say
there is no question of proportion in this war.
There cannot be.
I am afraid, honourable senators, I have
been somewhat carried away. I will tell you
frankly the reason why. This question has
been a disastrous one for Canada. Yet it
had to be brought up. My honourable friend
says conscription is not necessary to-day, and
refers to others who say it is not required.
Count them on the fingers of your hands if
you like. But what of to-morrow? What if

JULY 27, 1942
a second front is opened, such as the Russians
are now praying for on their knees? What
will be the needs of our army in that event?
Up to now we have lost very few men, thank
goodness. The war has cost us more in money
than in men. There is a French proverb which
says, "Plaie d'argent n'est pas mortellea money wound is not incurable." But when
we open a second front, what then? Germany
will not yet be beaten. We know what happened in 1918, when Ludendorff recommended
that an armistice be asked for. He knew perfectly well that he could resist no longer; that
his game was up. Yet since 1918 Germany
has constantly claimed that she had never
been beaten. There is only one way to
down the beast and keep it down, and that is
to beat it at home, so that it will suffer and
will know that it is beaten. When the time
comes to open a second front can, anybody
say what number of men we shall require?
If we do not get the men through voluntary
enlistment, how are we going to get them?
Are we going to do without them and leave
our boys in the trenches without support?
Are we prepared to accept that policy? I say
frankly that I am not. I was for conscription
in 1917, and I am for conscription to-day.
I am going to tell my honourable friend
something. He says that in 1917 conscription
did not yield very good results. There are
a great many within the sound of my voice
who know why. The success of conscription
in 1917 was made impossible by the most terrible campaign that we have ever seen in this
country. Those who were for conscription
were hounded. I know it. I know two men
in this House-there may be more-who were
threatened with being blown up with dynamite. The people of the province of Quebec

were told that they were not bound in law,
in duty or in honour to submit to conscrip-

tion for overseas.

What was the result? Of

course conscription could not be successful
with the Liberal party appealing to the
country as it did. Mind you, I do not want
to attack the Liberal party. We are divided

enough.

I

arn

only stating facts.

The

Liberals in this House know what occurred,
and if I make any errors they can correct
me. You can understand the position of a
young man who, when expecting to go to the
battle-field, was told by his member of Parliament and his chief that there was no
obligation on hirm to go overseas. He was
advised: "Go voluntarily if you like, but in
law, in duty or in honour you have no

obligation to go." Do you think that was
conducive to getting an answer in favour of
conscription?
If the Liberal party are going to do in the
province of Quebec to-day what they did in

1917,

perhaps my honourable

friend from

Grandville (Hon. Sir Thomas Chapais)

is

right. But I sincerely hope they will not do
that. If anything could stop them, it might be
a reminder that the attacks made against the
French race in Canada since this question was
first mooted have been terrible. There is no
other term for thern. I do not want to
describe them, for that would be too painful a
task. But may I say to honourable senators
that in the province of Quebec from 1917 up
to the present date every election campaign,
provincial or federal, has been fought on conscription.
Do honourable senators understand what
that means? In 1921 we had just corne out of
the war. The sky was clear and everybody
thought war was a thing of the past. We
believed that for generations to come the
League of Nations would save us from another
terrible calamity such as we had just gone
through. But in that year the elections in
my province were fought on conscription, and
everybody who had been for conscription was
marked on the forehead with the sign of
malediction. Do honourable senators understand? Every such man was to go down,
and be went down.
In 1925 we were still farther away from the
war and it might have been thought that the
Liberal party, or at least the individuals making up that party, had cooled down a bit.
But what happened? Conscription again. The
Conservative party troops were mowed down
at every election. In 1926 it was the same
thing. Again, conscription. And so it was in
1930. I remember that in that year a desperate
call came to me. I was told, "Beaubien, you
must immediately answer Dandurand and
Lemieux, because both of them are again
using the conscription argument." At the last
moment I had to speak over the radio. Why
need I say these things? You know therm as
well as I do. But what I am coming to is
this question: In view of these facts, do you
not think it is only fair that the attitude of
the French race in my province with respect

to the war should be considered purely and
simply as a result of the political policy of the
Liberal party? It is nothing more nor less
than that. During the twenty-five years since
the last war every election campaign, federal
or provincial, in the province of Quebec has
been fought on that one subject, conscription.
I say that, not for the purpose of attacking
the Liberal party.
Hon. Mr. HARDY: Oh, no.

NATIONAL RESOURCES MOBILIZATION

BILL
MOTION FOR SECOND READINGDEBATE

RESUMED

The Senate resumed from this afternoon
the debate on the motion of Hon. Mr. King
for the second reading of Bill 80, an Act to
amend the National Resources Mobilization
Act. 1940.
Hon. C. P. BEAUBIEN: Honourable senators, I shall endeavour to atone for having
retained your attention so long, and for having
been, I am afraid, much more violent in my
cxpressions than I should have been in this
House. I confess that my expressions were
perhaps not in accordance with the atmosphere
appropriate to the Senate. If I were to plead
anything in extenuation, it would be that I
did net expect to speak on the subject as
it has presented itself. I want to say te my
Liberal friends that I did not utter a single
word that had not been said by Liberal
members in another place, and I have the
documents here to prove that. I repeated only
what was, so to speak, the leitmotiv of their
attack. They asked the Government, in effeet:
"How can y1ou expect us te change in eight
days the policy that we have Lad for twentyfive years? It was not possible for us te do
that.' I want to ask honourable members
of this House and eminent statesmen throughout the land: What would happen in your
provinces with respect te this very question
if the people there Lad been educated in the
sarae way as the people of my province were,
and bv men of the same calibre?
Do net forget, honourable senators, that that
educational campaign in my province was
waged by perhaps the most brilliant galaxy of
public men that Quebec has ever known. You
will remember that Laurier -came back fron
the Diamond Jubilee of Queen Victoria
heralded as the greatest stateman in the
British Empire. He was the cherished son
of my province. I can tell you of an incident
in which I once figured. I was discussing
before an audience a question that I had
very much at heart, the school question in
Manitoba, and I thought the audience was

281

JULY 27, 1942

in agreement with me. I noticed an old man
who scemed to be quite moved. In fact,
tears were rolling down his face. I said to
him, "My friend, you must be an old Conservative?" He said, "Yes." I said, "Well,
at any rate, you are going to vote for us in
this election?" Do you know what his answer
was? He replied, "Oh, no sir. I cannot vote
against Laurier." Do you know what Laurier's
name meant to these people, to whole sections
in my province? He was to them the greatest
man, not only in the British Em.pire, but in
the world.
And Laurier was not alone. What about
Dandurand? He was a member of the Senate
for more than forty years. Could you have a
finer man than Dandurand, from every point
of view? Intelligence, character-Dandurand
had everything.
And what about Lapointe? Lapointe had a
reputation that overlapped the borders of
this country. And what about the other ministers? What about Lemieux, for instance? He
was a man of great talent, for a long time the
right arm of Sir Wilfrid Laurier. All the men
who participated in that campaign in my
province were the most brilliant men the
Liberal party in this country have ever
produced.
I ask honourable members from the other
provinces: If your people had for twenty-five
years been educated in that way, would they
not have acted as my people? If so-and
this is what I am driving at-try to stop the
attacks against the French race. The rest
does not count. I may say to the Liberal
party: You have won the entire province of

representative in the other House, any more
than we had in 1917. You are stronger than
you have ever been. What does it matter
whether you assume the responsibility? And
your own members of Parliament reproach
you much more than I do myself. I am mindful of my country and I say to you, the loyalty
of the French race in this province is necessary to Canada.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: It is necessary to
Canada. These attacks are driving my people
from everything that is British. Laurier used
to say: "I love France because France gave
me life, but I love the British Empire because
the British Empire gave me liberty." Do you
hear that any more? There is an ominous
silence now on everything that touches the
English race within and without the country.
Why? Because my people are tending te be
anti-English. You must not allow that. That
is at the root of the trouble. The rest is not
important, but that is important. Sometimes

when I recall these appeals that were made
and are now made time and again by small
politicians, by people who sec an opportunity
come to the surface like scum on turbulent
waters, I am surprised that the province of
Quebec has donc so well. Why, only a month
or two ago we had the Prime Minister of
Quebec with figures in hand telling us that his
province had already three times more men in
this war than it had in the other war.

Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: Is it possible to
have five finer looking boys than are depicted

the province of Quebec must be preserved, for
it will become precious for this country. If
you want to turn back the leaves of history,
I ask you to sec if you can find in the records
of the British Empire a similar instance of

282

SENATE

treated us with a briad generosity that
our people appreciated thcrcughly. There is
no doubt about that. But there is another
reason. When our people were left here after
the conquest the Catholic clergy were their
only advisers and protectors. Most of the
nobles, those of the beautiful chateaux, had
left. The farmers grouped themselves around
the church, and their curé looked after them.
What did he say to them? I do not like
to burden my speech with quotations, but I
should like to cite the words of the Archbishop of Quebec, His Grace Archbishop
Briand. Six years after the conquest, he said
to them:
Do not forget that the King of England is
your king. Do not forget that the English
have treated you with extreme generosity.
They have not interfered with your language
or your religion. and they have made you
British subjects, with al] the rights that that
implies. Do not forget the oath you have
taken. Be faithful to your king and to your
country.
That is what Msgr. Briand said. I need net
say that the clergy have always preached
along the same line. During the last war no
man spoke more eloquently to the French
Canadians in urging them to do their duty
than Msgr. Bruchesi, Archbishop of Montreal.
He said many things te indicate to them
where their duty lay, and lately Cardinal
Villeneuve added these words, which I think
are( unpri-essne:
You know the British Empire is not an
assciiation of nations purely and simply for
economia or tinancial exploitation; not at all.
The firitish Empire is an association of nations
bound together by the same principles, the
priineiples of justice and of liberty. And for
that y on owe it to yourselves to defend the
British Empire at the cost of your blood.

Now, am I right or wrong in making this
appeal to those who attack the province of
Quebec? My people are not responsible for
what has occurred. They do not deserve to
be
iaed slackers, to be pointed at as a
people who prevent this country from doing
its duny thoroughly.
Do net forget that
the collaboration of the province of Quebec
is esscntial. It is searcely necessary for me
to tell you that the effort we are making we
must all make together. The effort is too
big for one group of the nation only. We must
whole-heartedly collaborate together.
And
do not forget that after the war you will find
there is no race more God-fearing, lawabiding, hard-working and olid in its principles than the people of the province of
Quebec.
Seme Hon. SENATORS:

Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN:
Yeu people of
the other provinces do not know my people.
lon. Mr. BEAUBIEN

But I could point to some honourable senators
who do, and I am confident they approve
every word I say. Those who come in contact with my people come to me and say
they have never seen such thoroughly loyal
people as the French of my province.
The war will come to an end some day.
Then persons interested in com'ing to power
by one way or another will make subversive
suggestions, and then the collaboration of the
province of Quebec will be necessary to this
country.
I have just one more word to say before I
close. What is the trouble with my people?
They are just as good as any of you, and they
will defend their country to the last drop of
their blood; but they do not know that they
are menaced.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: You will say, "Well,
why are they not informed?"
That is all
very well. But what about the people of
France? For eight months after war was
declared the French people went about looking at their smiling fields, but they never saw
the hungry wolves at their frontier waiting to
jump at their throats. And France had been
invaded a hundred and twenty times. The
last time nearly seven-eighths of their total
industry was completely wiped out.
Yet
these people did net think they were menaced;
they were behind the Maginot line, and they
thought they were perfectly safe. De Gaulle
and Reynaud warned them of their danger
repeatedly, but were not heard.
But that is not all. What about England?

Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: Yeu good Englishmen weill know that what I tell you is true.
What did we have up to the time of Dunkirk?
The Americans called it a "phoney war." The
English people called it a "bore war," because
they were bored by it. They slept, and spent
their week-ends as usual, and the labour
unions refused to work for longer hours than
in ordinary peace time; yet they were immediately exposed to assault by Hitler and his
hordes.
Was Churchill listened to?
For
years he was uttering warnings, but he was
not listened to by Parliament, let alone the
English nation.
The trouble is that human nature always
seas what it desires to see. The people desired
to see peace, and they saw peace. Well, if
what happned to the French people was possible with the enemy right alongside of them,

prudent, did not think they were menaced, is

JULY 27, 1942
of Quebec, who is bound by the following
pledge to the electors of his province, a pledge
from which the recent plebiscite did not
release him. This pledge, which he made on
the 30th of September, 1939, in order to win
his election against Mr. Duplessis, is as
follows:
I undertake in honour, weighing each of
these words, to leave my party and even to
oppose it, if even one French Canadian, between
now and the termination of hostilities in
Europe, is mobilized under a Liberal Government or even a provisional Government, if our
present Ministers of the Cabinet of Mr. King
join the same.
Others. said the Government would not
enforce
conscription
because the
Prime
Minister would net give that satisfaction to
Berlin.
I know that they referred to a
formal pronouncement delivered by Mr. King
at Calgary not very long ago, on June 27,
1941, and reported by the Canadian Press as
follows:
The Prime Minister replied to circulars
widely distributed in Calgary to-day, urging
Calgarians to insist that Mr. King answer the
question: "How can we fight total war without
conscription?"
"I an going to answer that question right
now. If every man does his own duty first
before he concerns himself about the duty of
his neighbours; if, having done his own duty,
every man tries to help his neighbour to reach
a personal conviction of his duty instead of
wishing to compel him. Canada will have no
need of conscription for overseas service and
Canada will not be divided on every conscription issue. If Canada had conscription for
overseas service who would be the first to say
that Canadians had to be dragged away
unwillingly from their homes to fight across
the seas? That is what the radios of Berlin
would blare forth to the world."
It turned out that the guessing was quite
wrong, because Mr. King produced Bill 80,
which should have been entitled, "An Act to
enable Mr. King's Government to have conscription and not to have it at the same
time."
Everybody should have been satisfied, but
Mr. Cardin was not. He resigned in order to
be freer to captivate the souls of the No
voters better than he had done last April. He
also captivated the souls of a number of
Liberal members of Parliament so that they
might be kept secure for the Liberal party for
one grand merger of souls at the end of the
war-after, perhaps, we have had no conscription.
Possibly some members, and particularly
those who are smilingHon. Mr. DUIFFUS: We all are smiling.
Hon. Mr. COTE: I hope so.
Hon. A. L. BEAUBIEN: We are enjoying it.

Hon. Mr. COTE: Possibly some honourable
senators may wonder why I put so much stress
on the political feature of this question. The
answer is that, in my opinion, the Bill is a
political one and not straightforward legislatien. It is part of a manoeuvre to get rid of
what the Government described in the
Speech from the Throne read in this House in
January as "the controversy with respect to
the methods of raising men for military
service." It was not indicated in the Speech
from the Throne that it had been decided to
adopt different methods of raising men; but
it is obvious that it had been decided to get
rid of the controversy, for the Speech from the
Throne states it is the controversy which
obscures Canada's war effort. I may say without malice that it might also have stated, "and
obscures Mr. King also." Only a, few days ago
the junior senator from Vancouver (Hon. Mr.
Farris) deemed it his duty as a follower of
the Administration to protest in very vigorous
language against an American magazine
friendly to the Allies and to our common
cause, because that magazine had criticized our
Prime Minister.
I have read that article
since. I had net read it before the senator
brought it to our attention. The article states
that our Prime Minister had already on the
question of military service turned three loopthe-loops. Well, what did the senator expect?
It is, then, quite understandable that the Government wishes to bury the controversy both
at home and in the United States. However,
it does seem to me that the taking of the
plobiscite, the debate in another place and the
discussion throughout the country have certainly failed to remove the controversy so as
to allow the light of fame to shine on the
Government and on our Prime Minister.
Therefore, from the point of view of the continental popularity of those who resorted to
these tactics, the plebiscite was also a fiasco.
But why should there be so much controversy and' difference at home? At this point
may I say that of all the speeches delivered
on the subject of compulsory service none
forces itself more upon our attention nor has
been expressed with more lucidity than the
speech delivered by Hon. Mr. St. Laurent,
Minister of Justice. May I quote a few lines
from his speech? Speaking of the citizens of
French origin in this country and their
attitude towards conscription, he said:
It is not a word they are opposed to; it is
the thing which the word "conscription" has
come to synibolize in their minds. In their
minds, conscription is the theory that they can
be forced to enrol, train, fight and die for some
other cause than that of their own country.
I stated te the electors of Quebec East, in
my address to them in opening my campaign
on February 2, that there were in this country

286
286

SENATE
SENATE

two very different concepts with respect to the
real patriotism of its people. One, which is
that of practically all Canadians of French
origin, and a great many I am sure, if not the
majority, of Canadians of other origins, has
found its expression in the famous phrase used
by Lord Tweedsmuir in 1937:
"Canada is a sovereign nation and cannot
take her attitude te the world docilely from
Britain or from the United States, or from
anybody else. A Canadian's first loyalty is not
to the British Commonwealth of Nations, but
to Canada and to Canada's King, and those
who deny this are doing to my mind a great
disservice te the Commonwealth."
The other conception seems to many of us
in Quebec te be characterized by a blind, sentimental, proud and even arrogant attachment
te England, not only as the Mother Country,
but as the real homeland toward which all loyal
British hearts should ever turn.
The speech of the Minister of Justice
contains a great deal of truth, but does net
explain some of the things which it asserts
as facts. It is true that to the mind of many
No voters conscription is the theory that we
"can be forced to enrol, train, fight and die
for some other cause than that of our own
country." But the Minister did net give the
explanation that the "other cause" means the
cause of Britain, and that the conviction of
the No voters is the result of the predication
of the Liberaï party in the province of Quebec
and elsewhere, under the leadership of Mr.
King. I think we all remember the denunciations in the elections of 1917, '21, '25, '26 and
'30, of the Conservatives and the Imperialists,
the men who loved England better than their
own country, who would conscript our sons
for England, and ruin our country for
England. These are the denunciations which
had such influence on the minds of the
inhabitants of the province of the honourable
member from Montarville
(Hon. C. P.
Beaubien). A moment ago he was seeking
some other explanation. He hinted that newspapers had net penetrated to the remote
concessions of his province, and that therefore full knowledge of current tragic world
events has net reached them. I have gone
te the province of Quebec and spoken to
farmers and habitants. I found their information was pretty good.
Hon. Mr. LACASSE: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. COTE: But when the leaders of
a great party come to those intelligent
Norman peasants and tell them, as they have
been telling them for twenty-five years,
"Conscription is only a method to take your
sons away from y-ou so that they may go and
fight te die, net for Canada, but for England"
-although
the honourable senator's people
may have a strong regard for England, the
argument was bound to tell, and I am net
Hon. Mr. COTÉ.

exaggerating when I say that the explanation
for a great many of the No votes can be
found in the argument of the Minister of
Justice.
I need net repeat that these
denunciations of the political opponents of
the Liberal party in Canada have been the
leitmotiv of the Liberal campaigns for the
past twenty-five years, and unfortunately
they are net through yet. Mr. St. Laurent,
seeking election in Quebec East on February
2, explained the two concepts of Canadian
patriotism. I read a number of newspapers at
the time, and he was reported as follows:
There are two concepts: There is mine, Mr.
King's, the Liberals'; we love Canada. The
other concept is Mr. Meighen's, the Conservatives'; they love England first.
At a meeting within a few days after that
speech Mr. St. Laurent brought his colleague
Mr. Michaud into his riding. Mr. Michaud
decided to explain the reason why Canada
had donated a billion dollars to Britain and
he said:
We are giving to England a billion in order
to redeem from that country our economie
independence.
Obviously after those two speeches it was
not necessary for Mr. St. Laurent or for Mr.
Michaud to say to the electors of Quebec
East, "We are the people who are going te
protect you against conscription."
Let us
look at the other part of Mr. St. Laurent's
speech:
The other conception

seems

to many of us

in Quebec te be characterized by a blind,
sentimental, proud and even arrogant attachment to England, not only as the Mother
Country, but as the real homeland toward
which all loyal British hearts should ever turn.
I am quoting those words because they
are the words, not of the ordinary political
campaigner, but of a man of great ability,
for whose legal attainments I have the
highest admiration, and are words which
he has not spoken lightly. I do not know
whether honourable members on this side
or opposite have for England an attachment that is "blind and arrogant." I know
honourable members on both sides of the
House very well. Possibly I know those on
my side better, and, speaking for them, I
am free to admit that they have for Britain
an attachment that is sentimental and prend.
I know that in the province of Quebec, netwithstanding Liberal propaganda, they entertain toward England and toward the AngleCanadian partnership a sentimental and proud
attachment. I am afraid that in his desire to
paint Canadians who are Conservatives as bad
Canadians, as Canadians who are victims of
colonialism, the Minister has slandered his
opponents and has slandered also the French
Canadian people.

JULY 27, 1942
For what I am. now saying I suppose I
shall be branded as an Imperialist or a man
who loves some other land better than his
own. Of course that would be a ridiculous
accusation. I can trace my Canadian ancestry
back for more than three hundred years. I
love my country above all, but I do cherish
Canada's association with England and with
the countries of the British Commonwealth,
and I say that that Anglo-Canadian friendship
is a thing to be preserved with reverence and
care and not to be undermined or threatened
in order that political purposes and ambitions
may be served. That friendship has grown
from a century of fair and loyal treatment of
this country and of its people by Britain.
For proof of this assertion I would refer
honourable senators to the records for the
last century. One cannot find in the English
statutes or ordinances or regulations one line,
one word of enactment or law, prejudicial to
the interests of this country or contrary to
its dignity. On the other hand, look at the
accomplishments.
We have the statute of
Confederation, of which we have just celebrated the 75th anniversary. We have given
credit to the statesmen in our land whom we
call the Fathers of Confederation. But do
the people who have been calling us bad
Canadians for a generation ever stop to
give credit to Britain, who at one time
owned one-half of North America, including
Quebec and Ontario, the old Province of
Canada, the colonies of Nova Scotia, New
Brunswick, Prince Edward Island and the
Northwest Territories to the Pacifie, and who
in effect granted to Canada dominion and
quasi sovereignty over this vast and rich
country and its inhabitants? In these troubled
times when party polities and party government find it necessary to hold plebiscites and
split the country in twain, and use worde that
destroy unity in the hope of destroying
opponents, I think it is well to recall these
historical and fundamental facts.
A moment ago I said that Confederation
had given us quasi sovereignty over Canada.
In the course of time, by the adoption of
new constitutional practices and appropriate
declarations by Britain, through its authorized
spokesmen, and particularly by Mr. Lloyd
George in 1921, Canada obtained full nationhood. That declaration uttered at the Imperial Conference of 1921 by the Prime
Minister of England reads as follows:
The British Dominions have now been
accepted fully in the Comity of Nations by the
whole world. They are signatories to the
treaty of Versailles and of all the other treaties
of France.
They are members of the Assembly of the
League of Nations and their representatives
have already attended meetings of the League.
In other words, they have achieved full national
status, and they now stand beside the United

Kingdom as equal partners in the dignities and
responsibilities of the British Commonwealth.
If there are means bv which that status eau be
rendered even clearer to their own communities
and to the world at large we shall be glad to
have them put forward at this Conference.
Yet, did Mr. King's Liberal party give
credit to our old friend England for this
new recognition, a recognition not exacted,
but granted as a matter of course? Not at
all. It simply could not, because the Lloyd
George declaration had been made under
the Government of Mr. Meighen, a bad
Imperialist.
Not only was this circumstance not used to
promote a feeling of regard for England, a
feeling which we all could have shared, Canadians of French, English and other origins,
but Mr. King pounced upon the occasion
to ask for the enactment of the statute
promised by the Prime Minister of England
in 1921. Mr. King attended a number of
Imperial conferences, from which he always
came back with a story 'presented in such a
way that it meant that he had won great
victories against Britain and had wrenched
liberties from an unwilling people, just as in
days of old the barons of England had forced
King John to sign Magna Charta on the
meadows of Runnymede.
There were other manifestations of this tondency. Everybody remembers that in 1938,
a year before the war, when the clouds of
tragedy were about to burst upon mankind,
Britain, through its representatives in Canada, asked Mr. King's Government for permission to train airmen in Canada. The
answer was, "Ne; that would conflict with
Canada's sovereignty."
Does it not seem clear now to everyone that
the duty of those who have engaged in this
game of endeavouring to undermine in the
hearts of Canadians, not only French, but
English as well, the spirit of friendship for
Britain is to admit that they were wrong, and
that instead of making promises to win elections and then holding silly plebiscites about
the releasing of electoral promises, their duty
was and is to say that in 1917 we were, and
that in 1942 we are, fighting with Britain for
Canada, and fighting one for all and all for
one?
That is what I had in mind last January
when I opposed the Plebiscite Bill and said to
the Government these words:
As soon as the Government in honour and
conscience comes to the conclusion that the
interests of Canada demand compulsory service
for overseas, let its Ministers and members go
into their constituencies and tell the people of
Quebec that the voluntary system has failed.
Let them say to the people, in all humility and
in all sincerity, that the time has come when
Canada, their country, needs everything, even
compulsory military service for overseas. What
will happen? They will follow you.

SENATE

An honourable member stood up in this
House to reply to me and he said: "Really
how can Senator Coté expect his advice to be
followed? He has used harsh words toward
the Administration." I am not paying any
compliments now, although I should very much
prefer to be obliged to do so, but how can I
be complimentary in the face of what I
sincerely think is a second display of political
adroitness? Surely we have had too much of
that already. The very Act which we are
now asked to amend was just part and parcel
of the saine sort of things.
We remember the circumstances which preceded and accompanied the passing of the
Mobilization Act of 1940. Central Europe and
France had been vanquished and the world
was thrown into a period of uncertainty and
of almost complete darkness. There was only
one thing to support our hope and to rally
our courage, and that thing was a light that
shone over Britain; a light of resistance that

publie opinion was agitated. Questions were
being asked: "Why has net Canada moved
faster in the path of preparation and in the
task of dealing blows to the enemy?" The
people wanted to know why more had not
been accomplished during the nine months
which had intervened since our entry into the
war. The popularity of the Administration
was on the wane. If popularity was not completely gone, it was very much weakened, and
the Government had to do something which
had a semblance of action to regain popularity. Without coming to Parliament at all,
the Government could have then, under the
existing powers, mobilized the whole nation
and trained men for the army in Canada or
for the worksbop. It could have ascertained
its man-power and allocated it to those
functions in the war effort where all classes
of man-power would have been most useful.
In fact, this could have been done before the
fall of France, under the War Measures Act,
which gires to the Government authority to
do all those things. The Government bas not
used the War Measures Act for that purpose,
and in order to make the nation forget its
omissions and to supply an explanation for
the lack of preparedness the Government
annonmced that it would seek, through Parliament, power urgently needed to mobilize the
whole nation: its resources in men, material
and wealth.
These were described as
resources. and the Act was called the National
Resources Mobilization Act of 1940. The
announcement was broadcast over all radio
systems, through the Press, and in speeches,
and popularity began to improve. The Bill
was introduced and put through Parliament,
conferring upon the Government the same
Hon. Mr. COTÉ.

powers that it had under the War Measures
Act, but the Government included in the
Act section 3, which stipulates that even in the
most dire necessity our men trained for military duty under the said Act could not be
sent overseas. The Government had taken
advantage of the situation to remove any
immediate controversy regarding the methods
of raising men for military service overseas;
this at a time when the nation as a whole
was ready for everything. But unfortunately
the controversy was not dead.
Notwithstanding the very creditable records
of enlistment for the overseas army, resulting
from the patriotism of our young men, and
brought about also by a systen of coercion
worse than conscription, the controversy was
still alive, and it became more acute when
the United States entered the war.
The
United States, who are not part of the British
Empire and who cannot be accused by the
Liberal organization of having a blind and
arrogant affection for Britain, had the draft.
Mr. Meighen became leader of the Conservative party and advocated compulsory selective
service across the whole field of war. The
controversy and the obscuration grew at home
and abroad. The obscuration became unbearable. In order to get rid of both, Mr. King
held the plebiscite, and he now presents to us
this Bill.
The Bill as a measure of conscription is an
affront to Parliament. Parliament is the body
that should decide if and when the country
should have conscription; and Parliament
should enact the rules of the game, the causes
regulating exemptions and the method of
appointing those who shall bave the authority to select.

Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE:

Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. COTE: Therefore, from that
point of view I think the Bill is bad, and it
is only subject to that reservation that I
can bring myself not to oppose it. It is bad
also because of its uncertainty.
Honourable members may be curious to
know why, having praised the Bill and its
nakers so faintly, I still support it. My answer
is this. I believe that total war demands
total effort. This Government is in power.
If it does not ise the Bill we shall not be
worse off than if it had moved no Bill at
all. Therefore, by voting for the Bill I am
not interfering with the conduct of the war. If
J voted against it I might be interfering, and
I should never forgive myself. So I will vote
for the Bill, but without enthusiasm and with
resentment at the thought that as a member
of this House I have been manouvred into
a position in which I feel I am being forced
to give my consent to a terrible harlequinade.

JULY 27, 1942
Before I conclude I wish to express one
more thought. It is along the line taken hy
the honourable senator from Montarville
(Hon. Mr. Beaubien), that the handling by the
Administration of the question of military
service has hopelessly failed to change the
convictions of those who are opposed to conpulsory service. Indeed, it would be very
suprising if it were otherwise. Unfortunately,
after listening to the speeches made in another
place and elsewhere, and reading the editorials
of leading newspapers in this country, including Liberal papers like the Manitoba Free
Press, one must realize that there is a growing
feeling of antipathy and animosity against
French Canada because a substantial part of
it has taken the stand which we know it has
taken on this question. Credit is not given
for sacrifices already made by French Canada
in joining the colours in large numbers and
submitting loyally to all demands made for
the war. I am aware that we are fast moving
into a period of racial misunderstanding. It
is unfortunate and tragie, the more so because
it could have been avoided but for the play
of party politics.
I ask my English-speaking co-citizens to
restrain their feelings, to which politicians will
appeal in order to fill the voids caused in
their ranks by the mishandling of this question. I ask them to realize and admit that
if so many of my compatriots are obdurate in
their views on compulsory service, English
Canadians have been the aiders and abettors
of those who have induced them to hold such
views.
I say that if the Government gives up manœuvres of party politics, and if insults, threats
and provocations are avoided, there is still
room for common understanding and for preservation of the spiritual acceptance by all
Canadians of a common concept of duty, the
basis of which is loyalty to Canada, loyalty
to our partners and loyalty to our past and
future.
Some years ago, at a Canadian Club luncheon held at Ottawa, Sir Austin Chamberlain
said of Canada:
I have seen a great nation, to the formation
of which two great nations gave of their best.
I have seen a nation rich already in historie
tradition, the early chapters of whose story are
as full of romance and chivalry as any novel
of Sir Walter Scott.
These words from a great Englishman, who
was also a lover of French culture, I have
never forgotten. I was proud to listen to
them and to contemplate the picture they
painted of the two partners of Confederation, English and French, forming a great
nation.
We 'have walked many roade

together; we have donc great things together;
we have given birth to this nation. We
shall be called upon to do greater things in the
future, because Canada's destinies are much
greater than her past. So let us travel the
glorious path of the future together in understanding and amity, with our respective qualities and defects-for neither of us is perfectand let our friendship and, the unity of our
country never be disturbed by causes and
circumstances that are temporary, to the end
that the greatness and happiness of our country may be more permanent.
Hon. ATHANASE DAVID: Honourable
senators, I fully appreciate under what circumstances I am rising in this House to-night
to state the truth, as I see it, by placing my
cards and the cards of the province of Quebec
on the table. I do not intend to follow the
example that has been set this afternoon and
this evening by some honourable members
facing us. They tell us this is no time to
talk politics, that we must win the war, but
they go on to say that the Liberal party and
the election campaigns that have been held
in Quebec in the last twenty-five years are
responsible for the province's mentality as it
has been throughout that period and is to-day.
That is false. The mentality of Quebec

election in Drummond-Arthabaska brought

honourable senator from Montarville (Hon.
Mr. Beaubien), who is a friend of mine, we are
supposed to have taught Quebec to despise
the British Empire. Well, what were we doing
in 1910? We were gathering around the old
chieftain, Laurier, who, with a clear vision
of the future, was asking the Canadian people
to accept as a necessity the creation of a
Canadian navy.
And at the same time that the Conservatives of Quebec were making their alliance
with the Nationalists of Quebec, another
party, the Tories of Ontario, came in to make
a triple alliance. I do not intend to be long on
this subject, but I want to say that in view of
what history teaches, it hurts us to hear some
Conservatives, members of Parliament, including even certain senators, contend that if
there is any disloyalty in Canada it is the
result of Liberal preachings. We shail sec a
little later what history has to say about this.
While the Conservatives made their alliance
in the province of Quebec against the Canadian navy, in Ontario and the West they were
fighting Laurier on the question of reciprocity.
But let us come back to 1910, which was the
beginning of the nationalistie ideas that have

prevailed since.
There is no use in not
admitting the fact. What happened then?
Sir George Foster, one of the most eminent
orators Canada ever had, and a statesmanbut at certain times a politician-when
asked if the Nationalists could expect some
financial
support from the Conservative
party, made this answer: "Surely. Anything
to beat Laurier."
That was. the time, I say to my honourable
friend from Montarville (Hon. Mr. Beaubien),
when the Nationalist party was created. And
in 1911 the Nationalists of Quebec defeated
Laurier. We know the consequences. But
before dealing with them, honourable senators, I crave your indulgence to refer to another matter. I shall try to be brief. Nevertheless, if it is your desire that in future there
may exist between us of different creeds
and languages real unity, it can be based only
on one element, which may be a guarantee
for the future: it is a knowledge of the
bistory of Canada from the original foundation of Quebec to the establishment of the
English
domination,
and
then to
the
Confederation of to-day.
I know that sometimes, judging from
speeches by certain elements whio represent
only a minority, you are inclined to believe,
and in fact are led by your papers to believ e,
that the French Canadian has no more fidelity
to British institutions, no more admiration for
English peoiple, and no more desire to retain
allegiance to Great Britain. I am not speaking
of the Empire. We are to-day as decided
in our minds, our hearts and our souls ta
remain loyal as our ancestors were after
1763. In spite of everything that was done
then to discourage them. notwithstanding
that appeals were made to them by Washington in 1775, when in his famous proclamation ho told French Canadians, "Come with
us Americans and be free citizens of America,"
and notwithstanding that Frenchmen like
Rochambault D'Estaing and Lafayette appealed
to the habitants in the province of Quebec,
they remained loyal. Do not forget it was
only sixteen years after the defeat on the
Plains of Abraham, when the habitants might
have had in their bearts, and could not be
blamed for hiaving, a desire to become French
again or to get away from evil domination.
What did they do? I will Jet the man of
whom you on the other side have reason to
be proud, Sir George Etienne Cartier, speak
for me. He said:
But with the disappearance of British power,
they too would have disappeared as French
Canadians. These historical facts taught that
there should be a mutual feeling of gratitude
Hon. Mr. DAVID.

from the French Canadians towards the British,
and fromn the British towiards the French Cana<liens, for our present position, that Canada is
still a British colony.
Therefore, in the opinion of Cartier, but for
the action of French Canadians in 1775 the
British connection would have been broken
and British domination on the American
continent would have completely disappeared.
I was saying a few mimites ago that sometimes we members of a minority make certain
claims.
They may strike you as being
extravagant, but when you read what, for
instance, such a great historian as Macaulay
thought of the possibility and at times the
necessity of providing for the independence
of the British Colonies, why should you be
surprised at our aspirations? Here is what
Macaulay said:
The doctrine that the parent State bas
suprene power over the colonies is not only
borne out by authority and by precedent, but
will appear, when examined, to be in complete
accordance with practice and with policy. During
the feeble infancy of colonies independence
would be pernicious or rather fatal to them.
Ujndoubtedly as they grow stronger and stronger,
it will be wise in the home government to be
more and more indulgent. No sensible parent
deals with a son of 20 as with a son of 10.
Nor will any government not infatuated treat
such a province as Canada or Victoria in the
way in which it may be proper to treat a little
band of emigrants who have just begun to build
their buts on a barbarous shore and ta whom
the protection of the flag of a great nation is
indispensably necessary.
Macaulay adds:
Nevertheless, there cannot really be more than
one supreme power in a society. If therefore
a time comes at which the Mother Country finds
it expedient altogether to abdicate ber government authority over a colony, one of two courses
ought to be taken. There ought to be complete
incorporation if such incorporation be possible.
If not, there ought to be complete separation.
Very few propositions in politics can be so
perfectly demonstrated as this, that parliamentary government cannot be carried on by two
really equal and independent parliaments in
one empire.
You nay ask, "Why are you citing this?"
I reply: Only because of this. We in the
province of Quebec have never desired, andt do
not desire for the future, that any decision of
the Canadian Government should be influenced as it was in the past by other than the
Canadian people, by other mentalities than
the Canadian mentality, and by other pride
than Canadian pride.
The honourable senator from Montarville
(Hon. C. P. Beaubien) said, with great justice, that we were the first in Canada. Our
ancestors came to the banks of the St.
Lawrence in 1608. Now, may I put this
question to honourable members who are not

what Disraeli thought of "these wretched colonies." In 1852, writing to Lord Malmesbury,
he said:
These wretched colonies will all be independeut in a few years, and are a millstone round
our necks. If I were you I would push matters
with Filnore and make an honourable and
speedy settlement.
Cornwall Lewis, the Minister of War in
1862, said in the House of Commons:
I for one can only say that I look forward
without apprehension, and I may add without
regret, to the time when Canada may become
independent.
Robert Lowe, in 1872, upon the nomination
of Lord Dufferin as Governor General for
Canada, said, as is to be found in the Life of
Marquis Dufferin and Ava, by Sir A. Lyall,
volume one, page 286:
Now, you ought to make it your business to
get rid of the Dominion.
This brings me back to one of the assertions
I made at the beginning of my remarks. You
cannot expect from the Canadians of the
province of Quebec the same kind of attachment that you may have for what you call
the British Empire-what we, with great reverence and respect, call Great Britain.
Now let us go a little further. You may

further. Perhaps the cause of the French
defeat was that the Canadian mentality had
already formed, and that this led to indecision in an army composed of Canadian
soldiers and French soldiers.
There is no one who has greater admiration
for British parliamentary institutions than your
humble servant. But when we hear all the
time, "You were given privileges--there is no
minority that bas ever been treated as you
have been-never bas a minority been conceded as much as you have been," I say,
"Please do not go so fast." True, in the treaty
we obtained magnificent concessions from
England, but if those who came here later
could have had their will those concessions
would have been taken away from us inside of
twenty years. In support of my statement let
me quote Murray, writing in October, 1764, as
appears in volume 261 of the Canadian
Archives. He said:

Lower Canada had a majority of 200,000.
Yet equal representation was imposed. The
debt of Upper Canada was £1,200,000, and
that of Lower Canada was £95,000. In Upper
Canada the annual interest on the debt was
£56,000, the revenue was £60,000 and the
deficit was £75,000. Despite the protests of
Lower Canada, union was imposed upon it
on unfair terms. Well, I say with all due
respect, there was a confirmation for once
of the sovereignty of a minority.
Nine years later, when Lower Canada had),
I believe, a right te complain of the treatment it had received, the annexation movement was created. That movement, which
brought under its banner some of the most
important men in Montreal, had as its cause
the refusal of Great Britain to grant a protective tariff on Canadian imports. Now,
honourable senators, I will leave it to two
professors to speak. I quote from a work
entitled, "Annexation, Preferential Trade and
Reciprocity," by Cephas D. Allin, Assistant
Professer of Political Science in the University
of Minnesota, and George M. Jones, English
and History Master, Humberside Collegiate
Institute, Toronto:
That very party, who had always pretended
to such extraordinary loyalty and affection for
the mother country, now, when they feared that
some measure was to be adopted hurtful to
their pecuniary interest, turned round, as he
(Mr. Roebuck) had told them they would, and
threatened them with annexation te America.
It was not the people of Canada, whom they
had deprived of all they held dear,-it was not
the Lower Canadian French population who
talked of annexation te America. It was the
English, Scotch and Irish merchants, who had
embarked their capital in a favoured trade,
supported as they believed by protective duties;
and who, the moment it was proposed to do
justice te the people of the country by the
adoption of free trade, threatened this country
with republicanism and annexation.
The famous manifeste was signed by many
prominent persons, one of whom, J. J. C.
Abbott, later became Prime Minister of
Canada.
Others included Robert Mackay,
one of the gracious former citizens of whom
Montreal is very proud; Mr. J. Rose, afterwards Sir John Rose, Minister of Finance in Sir
John A. Macdonald's Cabinet; John Redpath;
John and David Torrance; Robert Jones, a
prominent Conservative politician and member of the Legislative Assembly; Jacob
Dewitt and Benjamin Holmes, John and
William Molson; D. L. MacPherson, who
afterwards became Lieutenant-Governor of
Ontario; and L. H. Halton, later a member
of the Mackenzie Administration.
But let
us come to the reasons why the annexation
movement did not succeed. Professors Allin
and Jones say:
Among the chief factors in defeating the
annexation movement in Lower Canada was

29ý

the loyalty of the bulk of the French population. Lord Elgin had keenly realized the
importance of cultivating the friendship of the
French Canadians. In an early letter te the
Colonial Secretary he expressed the opinion
that "the sentiment of French Canadian
nationality, which Papineau endeavours te
pervert te purposes of faction, may yet perhaps,
if properly improved, furnish the best remaining security against annexation to the United
States.
I pause there. A little further on the authors
say:
The loyalty of the Catholic clergy, and the
devotion of their simple parishioners, saved the
day for the British connection.
I pray you to note that that was the third
time the French Canadians saved the British
connection.

JULY 27, 1942
Six years ago, on my return from Europe, I
was so impressed with the certainty of war that
I took the only avenue open to me to present
that serious situation to this House, in the
hope that Canada might be withdrawn from a
catastrophe that seemed to me inevitable. Much
has happened in the meantime. Then most
honourable members regarded me as a pessimist,
but who by their wildest stretch of the imagination could visualize the situation in which the
world finds itself to-day?
Conditions have
changed.
I do not think the worse of any man who
changes his mind, but I like better the man
who bases his declaration on reason and logic,
so as not to have to change his mind. And
that is Quebec.
Hon. Mr. MAcLENNAN:
should.

They

possibly

Hon. Mr. DAVID: I will come to that.
That is the kind of interruption I like. Honourable members will recall that one of the first
causes-may I call it?-of retraction in the
province of Quebec was the war against South
Africa. I do not know the opinion of honourable members, but I have met many of your
compatriots who say that that was an error
on the part of Great Britain. And it is quite
easy to understand that we did not very much
like the idea of a war against a little people,
a minority. But let that pass. I come just
for a few minutes to the question as it stands
to-day. In 1918 this motion was presented
before the Quebec Legislature to allow the
opinions of its members to be placed before
the Canadian people:
That this House is of opinion that the province of Quebec would be disposed to accept the
breaking of the Confederation Pact of 1867 if,
in the other provinces, it is believed that she
is an obstacle to the union, progress and
developnent of Canada.
It is not a very dangerous motion. As a
matter of fact it was withdrawn by the proposer, Mr. Francoeur, without any vote. On
this motion my honourable friend from Rigaud
(Hon. Mr. Sauvé), who was then, I believe,
leader of the Opposition in the local House,
made a very good speech, which I find at page
34 of this Hansard. He said:
The number of requests for military exemption as well as the number of those who refuse
to respond to the call of the military authorities proves that of all the provinces, Quebec
has obeyed the law the best. Here is a table
of official figures in support of my statement,
a table furnished by the Director of Information, an officer of the Government:

to-day, and that is what my honourable friend
(Hon. Mr. Horner) was driving at. Volunteers

Hon. Mr. DAVID: In Quebec the percentage of those who reported was 95, while in
Ontario it was 62. In Quebec the percentage
of those who failed to report was 5, while in
Ontario it was 38. If he likes I will take the
figures for Alberta. In Alberta 53,979 were
called, 28,105 reported, or 54 per cent; in
Quebec 95 per cent. In Alberta, 25,874, or 46
per cent failed to report; in Quebec only 5
per cent. Maybe my honourable friend from

Hon. Mr. COPP: That is only one.
Hon. Mr. BAIG: There have been twentyfive cases in the city of Winnipeg in the last
two months. Those men were called, but they
had died in Europe fighting for Canada. My
own boy was called up six months after he
joined the Air Force. The notice contained a
warning that if he did not report he would
be treated as a deserter. Such cases account
for many of the failures to report in 1917.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: Are the figures
quoted from the Militia Department?
Hon. Mr. DAVID: They were cited by the
then leader of the Opposition in the Legislature of Quebec, who was Mr. Sauvé.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: But Hon. Mr.
Sauvé got them from the Militia Department?
Hon. Mr. DAVID: Here is a table of
official figures in support of rny statement.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: From where?
Hon. Mr. DAVID: "A table furnished by
the Director of Information, an officer of the
Government."
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: But that is not
the Mi'litia Department.
Hon. Mr. DAVID: I do not know." I am
taking the statement of my honourable friend.
Now,
far as the bringing in of conscription is concerned, my very good friend from
Montarxille (Hon. Mr. Belubien) this afternoon said fhat a beautif.ui letter had been
written in 1917 1
Archbishop Monseigncur
Bruchiesi. Yes, I remember, it was a beautiful
letter. It wa written after the Prime Minister of the time had declared tiat national
registration would noer mean conscription for
the ountr y. Afor tho Minister of Justice,
Honourable
Carls Dolierty, had gone and
sen the Archbishop and givein his word of
honour, Monseigne ur Brmiicsi tried to convinre evervone who registre d that it did not
mean conseription. It was done the sane way
in this cao. We do not object. Nobodv
objected to national regi-tration, but the consequence of it is that to-day we have conscription.
This afternoon I listened with reverence to
the words of wisdom of a historian respected
not only in our province, not only in this
country, but in every place where history is
read. The honourable senator from Grandville (Hon. Sir Thomas Chapais) declared that
in his opinion conscription was unnecessary

so

Hon. Mr. HAIG.

and inefficient. This afternoon I also heard
60,000 mentioned as the number who were
recruited or drafted under the Military Service Act. I have a pretty clear recollection
that when the discussion took place in the
House of Commons the leader of the Opposition, Mr. Manion, decliared that conscription
was a fatal error, and that the number of
conscripts then mentioned-I will verify this,
though I am pretty certain-was 10,000. Also,
I have the opinion of a general of the army
that not 1,000 conscripts ever went to the
front.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE:

Nonsense.

Hon. Mr. DAVID: When we see the effort
that is being made in every province, I would
ask in virtue of what principle you want the
word "conscription" to come into our laws. It
is not a question of effectiveness. The word
"conscription" must be there. Conscription
against whom? Is it for Canada or is it
against somebody, some province or some
group?
You have heard the figures given by the
honou-rable senator from Grandville. What
strikes me is this, that instead of criticizing
wbat has been done in Canada, instead of saying tîat we are not doing enouîgh, we should
take the attitude that was taken by a very
good English lawyer only last Saturday in
speaking of all the United Nations-that no
other country is doing as much in proportion
as Canada bas been doing in the last three
years.
Sone lon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. DAVID: Why not be proud of
our efforts? Why not be proud of our Army,
our Navy and our Air Force?
An Hon. SENATOR:

Politics!

Hon. Mr. DAVID: But no; our soldiers are
doing nothing, our Naval Service is no good,
our aviators are worth nothing, and our production of tanks and corvettes is valueless.
Hon. Mr. McRAE:
lonourable senators, I
do net tbink the statemrent should go on
record that this Iouse or any member of it
has not thie greatest enthusiasm for and confidence in our Army, our Navy, and our Air
Force, which is one of the grandest in the
service of the Allies. I should not like that
statement to go on the record uncontradicted.
It is not truc.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: And if my honourable friend will permit me, may I say that
I should not like it to go on the record that
only 10.000 men were sent to England under
the Military Service Act. We had an army

JULY 27, 1942

corps of 80,000 men. There were 20,000 men
in a division, which consisted of four brigades.
The loss of man-power was so great that the
number of brigades to a division had to be
reduced from four to three. Notwithstanding
the heavy casualties, Canada kept her divisions fully up to strength; and we had reserves besides. In other words, we stood by
our men.
Hon. Mr. COPP: I would ask if the 80,000 came into the army through conscription.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE:

Oh, no.

Hon. Mr. DAVID: Surely the honourable
senator is in a position to know. Probably
the memory of Mr. Manion was not very
good.
He was not
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE:
in the Government then.
Hon. Mr. DAVID: No, but if you look at
the 1939 Hansard of the House of Commons,
Volume III, pages 2440 and 2441, you will
find that that is where the allusion is made to
the number of men who went to the front.
Now, to come back. Monseigneur Bruchesi
wrote the letter that he was asked to write;
but the honourable member from Montarville
did net say what happened to his health after
conscription was adopted.
Hon. C. P. BEAUBIEN: If the honourable
s.enator would allow me: Monseigneur Bruchesi made a series of speeches, and there
were none finer during the war.

is only valuable as being a regulating body,
ealmly considering the legislation initiated by
the popular branch, and preventing any hasty
or ill-considered legislation which may come
from that body.
I believe, as does the honourable senator
from Grandville (Hon. Sir Thomas Chapais),
that we are making -a very great effort, an
effort which is bringing on the citizens of
Canada such a burden that misery has entered
into homes where formterly there was comfort.
With a population of 11,500,000, we have

an Active Army of 320,000, half of whom are

in England. We have an Air Force of 115,000
men, with 22 squadrons overseas. We have
a Navy of 36,000 men. This makes a total of
471,000 in the active forces. We have a reserve
of 130,000 men, plus 1,100 naval reserves. These
figures make a total of 602,100.
We have employed in war industry 50,000
who are engaged in the production of aero-

planes and equipment, 60,000 in maritime con-

struction, 45,000 in the production of chemicals, and 67,000 who are producing tanks. The
total is 222,000.
The number of unemployed in Canada is
less than 70,000, including men and women of
all ages.
It would seem, therefore, that we have
drafted into the armed forces and into industry about all who can be drafted. To equal
the effort of Canada-I do not say this for the
purpose of reproaching our neighbours, but
just that we may appreciate our own effortto equal the effort of Canada, the United

The paper in which that appeared is not
a Liberal nor a French Canadian journal. It
is published, not in the province of Quebec,
but at Toronto. It is loyal to the Crown,
and, I am sure, devoted to the interests of
the British Empire.
My closing words will be a quotation from
a letter I received not long ago:
In the Field.
Canadian Army Overseas.
20th June, 1942.

It is moving in the extreme to be kept in
touch with currents of thoughts which are
running so strongly at the moment in Quebec,
encouraging to note that free discussion-in
the defence of which we are over here-has
not died in our beloved province.
I may say here that the writer is not a
French Canadian, nor a Catholic. He is a
Captain, of Scotch descent and of the
Presbyterian creed, serving in an English
regiment. He goos on:
I hope you will not misunderstand me when

I say I was surprised and a littie hurt when
I learned you had made a radio address in
support of a "Yes" vote in the recent plebiscite.
I feel sure there is one aspect of the Quebec
situation whicl
bas been overlooked
cousistently, both in Ottawa and in enlightened
circles in our province. More than a year ago
I wrote of this to English-speaking friends in
Ottawa.
But it has yet to be given proper
consideration.
It is this: Canada is the onily place left
in the world where men and wonen are still
free to decide wliere they will fit in in the
picture of their country's war effort. I feel
very strongly that the principle of voluntarv
military service, though it lias been forgottenî
alimîost universally, is still a great human prin-

ciple which Canada, at least, ought ta maintain.
I advocate it with confidence and witi energy
because I know the results which were obtained

last summer
in MD. 5 wlien wise, understanding
men were in charge of recruiting in that area.
That was before the recruiting organization

becanie political, of course . . . And I know
perfectly well that if the people of all nationalities, languages and religiouns in Canada are
informed, lonestly and resnectfully, of w-bat

our Dominion is doing, seeking to do and hop-

ing to do, the response by the voluntary method
will b overwhelming.

I regret to say that our Federal leaders have

shownî a shocking reluctance to lead the country
lu this war. They have fed the people stilted,

its causes and requirements before our people.
It is time the Government forgot services
rendered in political campaigns and studied
the human motives and spiritual fitness of its
agents in going to the people with the story
of our needs.
French Canadians, as I need not tell you, are
serions people who require to know what they
are to do and why they are called upon to
do it. I know the sons of French Canada
in the regiments overseas, and I tell you they
are the finest soldiers Canada bas. They are
not here fron a spirit of adventure and bravade,
they are here with the full knowledge that
they are offering their lives for a great principle.
They came across the Atlantic with
their heads high and the sure knowledge in

their hearts that sooner or later they must
walk a via dolorosa so that others at home

might not suffer the bestialities of Hitlerism.

The leaders of Canada owe it to the men
over here to raise our reinforcements by the

same serious methods which brouglit us. They
have no right to cover their terrible errors
of oversight, indolence and political favoritism
front the ugly, lazy, coward's "oct" of compulsion. If voluntary enlistment bas failedand none of us here believe it has-then it
is not the fault of the Canadian people, but
of Canada's self-styled leaders.
Enlistnent and active service can be matters
only of deep, serious feeling and careful thought.
No humîan beings who are not going to fight
themselves have any moral or ethical right
to force othters to go. But they Io have the

moral and ethiral duty of helping men

and

womten to reach a brave decision voluntarily.

This has not been done.

And util it is done,

My
iteneurabie leader (Hec. MrHlon. Mr-. HOWARID,

JULY 28, 1942
King) gave us yesterday a splendid picture
of what has been accomplished. I do not
intend to enlarge on it, but I would point out
to honourable members thaît at the outbreak
of war we had in Canada only the automobile industry equipped for war work. Let
me go further. The automobile industry, by
its production and shipment of motor transports at a rate never heard of before, is one
of the reasons why we held Libya during the
first German rush. My honourable friend
the leader opposite shakes his head. I mean
to say that was the only industry absolutely
ready for war production. I will turn to the
steel and other industries in a minute.
All honourable senators will remember a
new industry started in Ontario to manufacture the Bren gun. I think I am not
giving away any of the secrets which I have
here from the Department of Munitions and
Supply when I say that' the production of
Bren guns is beyond anything we ever
dreamed of, although during the start of that
undertaking about six months' delay was
caused by the criticisms of Colonel George
Drew. When I think of what is going on in
another House at the present time, I wonder
whether we are fighting George Drew or the
Japs, and whether, when this war changes,
as it will in the next twelve months, after
every battle we lose or win we are to be
faced with an investigation in the Parliament
of Canada.
I have before me an editorial from the
Montreal Star, which expresses my feelings in
the matter. I shall read only a portion of it.
The editorial appeared in the issue of July
23 under the heading of "Exploiting Grief."
I think it is one of the finest articles we could
have on the Hong Kong situation, and I
commend it to the attention of honourable
members. I direct attention particularly to
this paragraph:
What conceivable beneficial purpose can be
served, therefore, by simply repeating ad
nauseam charges already made it is impossible
to discern.
In many places throughout this country I
often hear this statement: "French Canadians
are hewers of wood and drawers of water.
In the business world they do not stand in
line with English Canadians." Let me give
one example in refutation. Three French
Canadians of Sorel, along with a former Minister of the Crown, had sufficient initiative and
foresight to go over to England and to France
to conclude contracts for the manufacture
of guns. Their factory produced the first
guns at Sorel in eight months' shorter time
than similar industries making the same guns
in England were able to get into production.

I appeal to any honourable members who
have not visited that industry to go to Sorel
and see what is being accomplished in the
production of admittedly the best 25-pounder
field gun, and shore battery and naval guns.
I come now to what I think the honourable
leader opposite had in mind when he shook
his head just now; that is, in regard to an
industry starting from scratch. That means
something. If you have a factory such as
the Canada Car Company or the Canada Steel
Company and one hundred other splendid
industries in Canada have, this implies
organization and personnel, and even then you
have to tool up your factory. But it is a
much bigger job when you start from scratch,
that is, put up your building, install machinery
and get into production in eight months'
time. I wish to pay tribute to those French
Canadians so prominent in the business world
of Canada.
We have accomplished something else that
is most interesting to the taxpayers of Canada. As I travel up and down this country
business men say to me that this war is
costing too much; and they usually search for
the reason. I believe I may say without
fear of successful contradiction that though
we have been in the war since September,
1939, we have yet to hear of one single war
scandal involving the Government.
We
have made remarkable progress in price reduction. In 1941 the Bren gun cost $300; this
year it cost only $192. In other words, we
can now build two Bren guns for the price
that one cost last year. That is important to
the taxpayers of this country. In Toronto
the Browning machine gun in 1941 cost $402;
this year that cost has been reduced to $220.
Similar reductions have taken place all down
the line.
As to tanks, I am not permitted to state
how many have been turned out in Canada.
We were not starting quite from scratch in
this case and I am not going to give details
of how long it took before certain parties
allowed us to have the plans and specifications necessary in order to get into production. The Canadian Pacifie Railway turned
out the first tank in Canada, and the Montreal.Locomotive Works the second. We have
shipped hundreds of Canadian manufactured
tanks into Russia. By this fall our tank production will run into thousands. And probably the tank is the second most useful war
weapon.
Then there is another phase of our war
effort. Everybody knows that before the war
Denmark and Belgium exported most of their
butter and cheese to Great Britain, that the
Argentine was Canada's greatest competitor

302

SENATE

in shipping beef and wheat into the British
market, and that Australia sent to Britain
wheat, beef, wool, cheese and butter. The war
cut off most of these sources of supply, and
Britain turned again to the one great source
for these commodities, Canada, and asked if
we would make good the deficiency. In June
this year thc production of crearnery butter
was 42ý million pounds, or a million pounds
greater than the production last year. True,
the United States are now co-operating in this
work.
I think it is cornmon knowledge that
Canada, with her undeveloped resources and
agricultural wealth, is one of the great war
prizes sought by the Germans. But Canada's
greatest wealth, in my view, is ber men and
women, lier boys and girls.
Sorne Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. HOWARD: ilonourable senators
will, I know, pardon a personal reference, since
it is necessary to preface what 1 arn about 10
say. My old dad, who passed away nineteen
years ago yesterday, said to me, "Charlie, in
order to fit yourself for the future in this
country of ours, you are going to learn the
French language." At fourteen years of age
I was sent to Beauce county to learn French,
and I lived with French people for twentythree years. I was taken into their hearts.
I can neyer forget the kindn~ese whieh the
families of Beauceville extended to me, a
green English kid going into an entirely
French country. One of the girls is to-day
the wife of the present Minister of Justice.
While there I went to church with them and
to social gatherings, and not only did I learn
something about tbe French people, but I also
learned to love their nationality. I arn convinced that every English-speaking Canadian
would feel exactly as I do if he had enjoyed
the privilege I had of living with French
Canadians. Honourable members, if there is
any misunderstanding in this country to-day
between French and English-speaking Canadians, it is because we do not know one
another.
Some Hon. SENATORS: That is right.
Hon. Mr. HOWARD: We have adopted a
different educational system frorn that of the
United States. They have wbat is known as
the steam-roller system. Wbether immigrants
corne frorn Germany, France, Switzerland or
any other country, they are passed under the

in fact, two civilizations. But our systern will
Hon. Mr. HOWARD.

be workablc and lend itself to co-operation
only if each of us bas respect for the qualities
of the other, and if that is so we shall bave a
still better situation than prevails under the
American system.
Tbe French Canadians are hero-worsh ip pers,
and sincere, loyal, bard-working people. They
are loyal to their borne, for the French Canadian is a home lover; they are loyal to their
parish, loyal t.o their leaders, loyal to their
province and loyal to Canada. Wben I see
articles such as I bave read in some papersI arn going to cite only one of them-I arn
surprised that wbile the situation bas been
allowed to continue we have been able to
accomplish in Ibis country as rnucb as wve bave
accomplished. I bave no desire to pass judgment on, or to condone or condemn, the conduct of any group or individual. My aim is
sirnply to prornote a better understandinig between the two great races. If we are to win
this war we must gel bhind the Governrnent,
and inistead of criticizing the other fellow we
rnust examine ourselves and ask, "What arn I
giving as my contribution 10, Canada's war
effort?"
For generations French-speaking Canada
bas been told by English-speaking Canada of
the advantages of the British connectionfreedom of thought and action in ahl circumnstances, and, above al cîse, the rights of
minorities. This is the democratic way. Are
the English Canadians now going to do the
foolisb thing, the dangerous thing? Let us
leave out comparisons with other countries.
Let us not forget that Ibis is not the only
country that bas problerns witb regard to

destroy a country and ils effort, just do as
the Germans did: create a rninority problemn
and it will learl t aIl kinds of trouble.
The French-speaking Canýadian resents compulsion in any formn, particularly when il is
contrary to wbat be believes 10 be right. His
temperarent is entirely different frorn that
of the English-speaking people. Once be is
sold on a principle he stays sold. Let us
remember that for twenty-fix e years the
Frencb-speaking Canadian bas resented conscription as imposed in world war No. 1,
without the people being consulted; let us
rernember that the Liberal party bas bold birn
for twenty-five years that there would be no
conscription; and finally let us rernember that
in the hast election the Conservatives told hima
that they were as much against conscription as

JULY 28, 1942
anybody else. Let us concede that every
Canadian bas a right to have bis own opinion
and to stick to that.
Insular egotism in men leads them to spend
their time applauding their own ideas, trends
of thought and principles and ignoring or belittling the intelligence and. capabilities of
other nationalities and nations. To this our
tardy start towards success in this and other
wars is due. Canadian unity is vastly more
important than the political survival of any
party or individual, and Canadian unity can
be assured only by forbearance and understanding, flot by domination. In domineering
arrogance you have the baeis of Fascism.
Now let us see what would be the effect of
conscription on this country. The other day
1 was at Ayer's C]iff, in the county of Stanstead, sitting and talking with a farmer of
that district. He usually employed two men.
One of them enlisted and is now in the
Canadian Air Force. A few weeks ago hie
came up and flew over the farm, and waved
to bis former employer to let him know how
pleased hae was to be in a position to do bis
share. The other man is in the Sherbrooke
Fusiliers, a regiment which. is either overseas
or just going overseas. And do you know,
hon-ourabie senators, that last year that farmer
milked seventeen cows niglit and morning,
witbout any assistance, even from bis wife?
During six weeks of that time, when the
waterworks were frozen up, hie had to haul
water for bis cattie. I tell you this story
only hecause I want people througbout this
country to know that in spite of tbe fact
that there is no help, or is much leasened
belp, to be bad, agricultural production in
Canada is still on the increase. We sbould
give fuit credit to the real, genuine farmers
who are doing tbings and assisting in the
present war.
Now may I put just a few figures of production on record? 0f butter, in 1939 we produced
287,000,000 pounds; in 1941, 286,000,000 pounds.
0f cheese we produced, in 1939, 125,000,000
pounds; in 1941, 149,000,000 pounds. Of
bacon, we produced ini 1939,- 187,000,000
pounds; during the past year, 464,000,000
pounds. 0f bogs we produced 3,700,000 in
1939 and 6,225,000 ini 1941. 0f evaporated
milk, in 1939 we produced 131,000,000 pounds,
and laÉt year 200,000,000 pounds. There was
a similar increase in the production of wool.
I wonder, therefore, if those wbo are advocating conscription are really sinoere, or
wbether it is flot really a political issue. If
you take any more men off tbe farm, how can
we continue te increase the agricultural production which is so essential to our war effort?

303

Take for instance an industry such as mining. Do we realize tbe situation in the mining
industry? Do we realize that Canada supplies
over ninety per cent of tbe nickel of the world,
and that that industry is 800 men short of the
number needed to, carry out its programme?
Do we realize that many mines have been
obliged to stop keeping up their stopes and
to cease work on reinforcing tbeir drifts.
Take the shipbuilding programme. At the
present time 40,000 men are required in this
industry, and are being used in just one
branch-the construction of freigbt boats,
wbicb are of vital importance.
That, honourable senators, is the situation
as I see it in agriculture, in mining, and in
shipbuilding; and we know what it is in the
munitions industry.
Now I want to say a word about en'listments
in the province of Quebec, and I say it ini ail
bumility. Those of you who know the emall
town I come from, the city of Sherbrooke,
will hie interested in figures showing the
accomplishment there, wbich. I am going to
put on tbe record.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: It is a city.
Hon. Mr. HOWARD: The 35th Field Battery went over to England, a complete unit,
in December, 1939, three montbs after the
declaration of war. The second unit to go was
the Base Depot group from the Sherbrooke
Regiment. The third unit was the Sherbrooke
Fusiliers, the only composite regiment in
Canada, consistîng of three companies of
French Canadian men and officers, and two
companies of Englisb-speaking men and officers. This regiment is overseas at the present
time. As if that were not enough, the Regiment of Sherbrooke and the Fusiliers joined
together to create the composite Sherbrooke
Fusiliers. Then the French boys said, "We
want a regiment of our own," and the Fusiliers
Regiment, ail French Canadians, moved out
of the exhibition grounds at Sherbrooke on
Friday of last week. Further, many people
in Sherbrooke, in Compton, in Stanstead, and
especîally in Bury, had husbands, eweethearts and brothers in Hong Kong and are
unable to get any news of them. We have
hundreds of men in the Air Force. We have
in the Air Force Cadets an organization that is
simply marvellous. This ie composed of boys
wbo are too young to go into the Air Force
at the present time, but who are taking their
training and getting ready to enter the Air
Force as soon as the dlock ticks off the
moment when they will be of age.
Last week the officers of the 'English regiment, the Sherbrooke Regiment, came to me
and said: "You are going to Ottaws, senator.

SENATE

304

If vou have a chance to say a word to Colonel
Ralston, tell him that all our officers, all our
non-commissioned officers and a big nucleus
of our regiment have already signed up for
active service, and cannot get taken on."
I give you these facts and figures simply
because I do not want anybody anywhere in
this country to think that we are not doing
our duty tunder the voluntary enlistment
system. I have a chauffeur who has been
with nie for thirty-four years. He bas one
boy and six girls: the boy is in the Air
Force. My gardener has four boys and two
gýirls: two of his boys and his son-in-law are
in active service. My secrotary in Sherbrooke
bas a husband and two brothers overseas
at the present time. My secretary in Ottawa
has two brothers overseas. My cook has a
brother overseas, and I learn that the parleur
maid also bas a brother overseas. And all of
these people are French Canadians. That is
the situation in Quebec.
Some Hon. SENATORS:

Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. HOWARD: I go further than
that. The people in my district in the
province of Quebec are mostly French, and in
travelling about it I have yet to go into
one single home which has not someone
directly serving in the present war. So I
think we are doing pretty well. But probably
it is still net enough.
I close witl this remark, and I think it is
most important to the whole subject. It
so happens that I, lýike many others here,
have a number of personal friends in the
newspaper game in the province of Quebec.
We have not very many -papers in that
province, but we have some good ones.
Everybody knovs John Bassett of the Montreal Gazette, J. W. McConnell of the
Montreal Star, the Hon. P. R. Dutremblay
of La Prcse, and the Hon. Jacob Nicol, my
business associate, who bas four papers and
two radio stations-not forgetting LAction
Catholique. These fellows are doing a real
job for the people of Canada with their
publicity and propaganda at the present time.
Nevertbeless, I believe they could do more.
If I were in charge, I would call in the
proprietors of all the newsvpapers in Canada
and would put the cards on the table. These
men know as wel as we do the seriousness
of the situation. I would not allow one single
French-language newspaper in the country to
publish one word which is detrimental to the
English-speaking population, and I would not
allow the English-language newspapers to publish one single word against the French
Canadians.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. HOWARD.

Hon. Mr. HOWARD: Surcly to goodness

enough news to make it unnecessary to slip

such as I have seen by the hundred.
I was sent yesterday a marked copy of a
paper, from which I want to read a few words.
A front page editorial which states, in big
type. "Quobec Won't Figlt Overseas," closes
in this way:

We fear the people of Canada outside Quebec
will not tolerate the presence of representatives

rotten stuff as that?
Some Hon. SENATORS: What paper?
Hon. Mr. HOWARD: Well, it comes from
Toronto.
Hon. Mr. BLACK: What paper is it?
Hon. Mr. HOWARD: The Canadian Mining Reporter, of Toronto. It came to me as
a narked copy; otherwise I should not have
ised it. I Io not take it.
Honourable senators, let us act as we should
in this matter. Since we have maintained in
this country two nationalities, two races, two
languages and two civilizations, each of which
las certain characteristics of which the other
should be proud, let us ask the newspaper
men not to print one single word detrimental
to either side of the picture until after this
war is over. If we do that we shall get a
new interest and a new stimulus in this
situation.
Sone Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.

I should like to end with these words from a
speech made by President Roosevelt on
February 16, 1942:
Let us then march forward together, facing
danger, bearing sacrifice, competing only in the

JULY 28, 1942

effort to share even more fully in the great
task laid upon us all.
Let us, remembering the price that some have
paid for our survival, make our own contribution worthy to lie beside theirs upon the
altar of man's faith.
These are my views in connection with the
present conduct of the war and the present
Bill.
Hon. A. D. McRAE: Honourable senators,
I think it was George Adams who had a
rather trite saying that he frequently used:
"There is no yesterday to-day." It seems to
me that in the seriousness of the situation
confronting us we cannot afford to waste a
single moment or effort on the things that are
of the past, and that we must confine our
every energy to to-day and to-morrow. Having said that, it is with regret that I have to
ask your indulgence for a moment while I
refer to a personal reference made last evening by the honourable senator from Sorel
(Hon. Mr. David). He was kind enough to
tell me in advance that he intended to refer
to the matter, and he was particularly kind in
reading, in the course of his speech, my
answer to the question asked me in 1940. I
feel I need not say anything more about that
answer, because it was quite complete.
The honourable senator mildly criticized me
for not being more careful to avoid reaching
conclusions from which I subsequently have
to recede. Well, I do not know that I need
offer any explanation to honourable senators
who were present eight years ago when the
matter in question was brought up. But I
would tell the honourable senator from Sorel,
if he were hereHon. Mr. DAVID: I am here.
Hon. Mr. MeRAE: I beg your pardon. I
can say to my honourable friend that I went
over to Europe well armed with letters of
introduction. I spent four months there and
had ninety important interviews, not countng
talks with dozens of people I met in various
countries, which included, of course, England,
France, Germany and Austria. It was the
hardest job I ever undertook, and I came
home about as tired as when I started. I wàs
a glorified reporter, if there ever was one, and
since that time I have had more sympathy for
press reporters than I ever had before. It
was only my certainty of impending war that
gave me the courage to introduce into this
honourable House that very unpopular motion
I made at the time. I have been grateful to
the Senate ever since for the kindly way the
motion was received. I think the discussion
on the motion did no harm. It revealed quite
a unity in this body, which was entirely
adverse to the motion, and I think it probably

had some educational results in the country.
Since I made that speech-I was going to
say that famous speech, because apparently
it is getting to be a hardy annual-I have not
read it, but I think on general issues it contains a number of points that have been well
borne out in the interval, and will stand up
even to-day.
I trust that I have now replied to the
honourable senator's admonitions. I have no
embarrassment whatever in talking about this
matter, for I am in very good company.
Literally hundreds of persons in Great Britain
have similarly changed their position in the
last eight years. No less a world figure than
Mr. Roosevelt himself said not very long ago
that Americans would not be sent abroad to
fight. And in discussing the present Bill the
Prime Minister of this country expressed the
feeling-with certain strings attached, I
admit-that conscription in Canada may become necessary. So I can assure honourable
senators that, in the good company in which
I find myself, I deal with this subject without
any embarrassment whatever. I would remind
my honourable friend of that old saying:
"Wise men change their minds." The rest of
it I will not repeat.
When this Bill goes through, as I am sure
it will, conscription will be on the Statute
Book. I intend to vote for the Bill. Personally, I think conscription is essential as a
back-log to proper and efficient compulsory
selective service. At the present time in almost
every village and certainly in every city in
Canada you will sec on the streets young men,
doing no useful war service, who would make
good soldiers. Further than that, our munitions
plants and other war industries are filled up
with young men who are doing a useful war
service, I admit, but who are fit for the
Army. I ask you, honourable senators, do
you think a young man who for the last two
and a half years has been earning six or
eight dollars a day at a munitions plant will
sign up now at Army pay and forgo his
present freedorn and enjoyment of life? I
think it is safe to say that these young fellows with the big wages and with their girls
are responsible for much of the increased
liquor traffic that is worrying so many people
to-day.
The point I am trying to make is that I
do not see how you can get these young men
from their present positions unless you have
some definite authority for calling them out.
I believe in compulsory selective service, and
I think it should apply to every Canadian with,
out regard to age or sex. Every person should
be in the position where he or she can best
serve the nation. Nothing less than that is
efficient selective service.

306

SENATE

With regard to the Bill now before us, the
question which concerns Canadians is whether
we have sufficient reinforcement for our Army
overseas. We do not need to worry about
the Air Force or the Navy, for both these
services-of which, as I said last evening,
every Canadian may well be proýud-have se
far obtained all the recruits they need through
voluntary enlistment. But the situation with
respect to the Army is different. I have tried
to ascertain just what the overseas situation is.
I find it a difficult matter to get information,
because there are no definite figures and one
is compelled te arrive at figures from deductions, which are not always a safe way to calculate. On March 26 this year the Minister
of National Defence said he expected to send
over in the fiscal year 100,000 men, of whom
25.000 would be for new units and 75,000 for
reinforcements. Those, I should say, would
represent ample reinforcements for our forces
overseas if those reinforcements were only
in England, where they are needed. The
Minister said that at the end of the fiscal year
about 175.000 men would be in the Army overseas, but he qualified that by adding that this
number depended on c:asualties.
It is rather difficult to ascertain the number
of casualties. It is reported that replacements
so far have totalled about 50,000. Naturally,
those replacements were larger in the First
Division because the older men who in their
enthusiasn volunteered for overseas service
were not able to stand the pace of present-day
war and had to be returned, to Canada. That,
of course, is net to their discredit. As we progress, these replacements will be fewer, but it
is very difficult to say what they will be. We
have the Fifth and Sixth Divisions diestined for
overseas this year. They are the fighting divisiens. The Seventh and Eighth Divisions are
for home service. So the total movement this
year would include the 100,000 referred to by
the Minister. The Fifth and Sixth Divisions
will number about 32,000 men. They too will
require reinforcements, and consequently between 130,000 and, 150,000 men should be
transported to England in, the present fiscal
year.
Aside from the difficulty of getting the
necessary men to make up that number, there
are the present difficulties of transportation,
which are very serious. We must recognize
that the men who have been willing to volunteer have largely gone overseas or are now in
training, and when we come to make up whatever the deficit may be between the men
available now and the 150,000 required, the
problem is much more difficult than it was
with our first divisions.
Hon. Mr. McRAE.

Witb reference again to reinforcements for
overseas, we have at the present time four
divisions in England, three infantry and one
tank. An infantry division when complete
numbers between 15,000 and 16,000 men, but
for the purpose of my caleulation I will assume
the 16,000 figure. A tank division has 12,000
personnel. Three infantry divisions of 16,000
men each and a tank division of 12,000 men
would give us a corps strength of 60,000.
Taking the number of men whom the Minister
of National Defence says will be in England
at the end of the fiscal year, 175,000, less, of
course, wastage and the 100,000 men whom he
says we shall send over this fiscal year, you
have left 75,000 men in the corps and in the
reinforcements in England. On that basis our
reinforcements available in England as at the
date he spoke of would be 15,000 men. In
arriving at that deduction I have taken the
units as complete. I have seen estimates, net
authoritative, that our reinforcements behind
the corps are 12,000 men. I think we can be
certain that 15,000 is net far frem the mark.
But I submit, honourable senators, that is not
enough; barely sufficient to make up natural
wastage. True, we have been fortunate in that
our Army has not had to go into action; but
if a second front were opened up next week,
our four divisions might be expected to be in
the vanguard of the attack, and the casualty
lists would soon take up all the men we have
in England as reinforcements. I do not think
it is too much to say that if our troops were
engaged in a serious conflict and subjected to
a real blood bath, we should soon have, not
four divisions, but three, and if the battle continued very long we might have only two
divisions. No army unit below strength can
fight efficiently. The only thing to do in that
case would be to consolidate the units in
order to keep two or three divisions, or whatever number it might be, up to 100 per cent
strength.
The forces we are raising here are composed
of green men. I think the honourable leader
of the House spoke of two or three months
being required to get under way. I would
point out that it takes at the minimum eight
months to train a soldier. Raw recruits
called up to-day would not be ready for
action until after eight months' training.
Furthermore, if we decide on conscription
for overseas service to-day, it will take
some little time to put it into operation.
It cannot be done overnight.
It is not
too much to say that our position is precarious.
I think it is very precarious. That is what is
worrying the Canadian people. They are net
worried particularly about our Air Force or
our Navy, but they are worried about the

much harder to raise men for that service.
How sufficient men can be raised without

we require almost twice as many men as we
have in the corps now. It is a huge task to
contemplate. It will be a grand effort if
accomplished, but we must have the men to

dangerous enemy. It stems rather from a
concept which is the fruit of certain teachings
and a certain popular education.
For over forty years, both as a journalist
and as a representative of the people, I have
taken part in national events, in the consideratien of our problems and difficulties as a
nation. I have seen Canada participate in
three external wars. I witnessed the birth of
military imperialism in, 1889, as well as the
controversvY it engendered among men of
great stature, in the forefront of whom stood
Henri Bourassa. the most gifted popular
representative of this generation, some of
whose predictions as regards the Canadian
problem would appear to be on the point of
materializing. To realize this one has only to
observe certain events which establish evolutionary trends, and to read over again his
writings and speeches without attaching undue
importance to the manner, method and temperament of the man. I am all the freer to say
this since I was never publicly regarded as
a follower of the Nationalist leader. Moreover. Lord Bennett could almost be said to
share my opinion. To judge by his statements in the House of Lords last week, lie
blames England for a deceiving coldness
towards the Dominions, believing the Canadians to be prouder of the British Empire
than are the people of the United Kingdom,
and foreseeing
possible resentment
and
political chalngcs during the post-war period.
Wliatever partisan opinion
nay bo held
against that emcinent statesman, no one can
gainsay that his frankness, if brutal at times,
is always illuminating, and worthy of our
attention. For my part, I am still loyal enough
to the former Canadian leader to believe that
the ex-Prime Minister of Canada still holds to
bis policy of "give and take" so soundly
enunciated in London in 1930, and again at
the Ottawa Conference in 1932. Living in the
very heart of the Empire, Lord Bennett can
perhaps all the better perceive the truth, first
of all with regard to his native land.
It is axiomatic with us French Canadians
that no one should be more Catholie than
the Pope nor more English than England.
Since the beginning of civilization evolutionary movements have always been started
by extremists and brought to fruition by
moderate, middle-of-the-road men, despite the
opposition of persistent reactionaries and
uncompromisimg traditionalists.

separatist unity, but of Canadian Confederation, because it remains to their mind the
constitutional form best litted to the needs of
the two main racial groups in this country,
and of all others who loyally unite with them
for the rational development of our immense
and wealthy land.
If for a long time justice has not been
rendered to whom justice is due, this is not
because of the Constitution, but rather in
spite of it. If certain destructive or weakening controversies, quite regrettable in themselves, persist in troubling Canada and impeding her progress as well as the attainment
of a very desirable understanding, this is
due to discrimination, to friction, to certain
remarks that always wound true Canadians
to the core.
We must reap where we have sown. The
best of grain always suffers from the weeds
that grow even in a good soil, if this is
poorly cultivated. The exploitation of certain prejudices in order to further political or
religious interests has warped the national
mind, fatally divided us, complicated our
problems and increased our difficulties, by
perverting our sense of right, of power and
of duty. It has turned out to be the greatest
headache in our federative existence.
Need I recall here the opinion of Stuart
Mill on the influence of education over the
will and actions of the individual? Or this
thought se well expressed by Jules Simon:
"Education is a process whereby a mind or a
heart shapes another mind or another heart."
Confederation, or rather our Constitution,
it is true. has been unable to prevent every
blunder or abuse or injustice. It remains
susceptible of improvement according to the
natural and inevitable evolution of the Canadian people. Consider Christianity. Is it not
the very charter of truth and justice and
virtue? Is it not the surest, the only means
of salvation? Yet how many Christians violate
its precepts and disdain its commandments,
to commit the gravest sins and enjoy an illicit
freedom? Does the parallel not hold true as
regards our attitude toward Confederation?
Every race has its model citizens. The two
main ethnical groups who built this country
may well be proud of having given birth to
many great men and honest citizens. But,
like the good grain, these men had to contend
with the encroaching weeds of prejudice with
its train of exploiters. For having preached the
truth and practised error, too many leaders
have created among our citizens a mutual distrust from which we are suffering more and
more in these critical d-ays of the war, and of
responsibilities which weigh heavily upon our
disillusioned people, who, at heart, feel them-

309

selves to have been deceived and exploited.
In this war, as in most others, the people must
reap the heresies their leaders have sown.
Ours like any other. We think and act logically
according to the education we have received.
That is how division, divergent opinions on
Canadianism, on militarism and on Canada's
participation in external wars, are born. We
must then consider such a split in opinion
not as disloyalty, but rather as the result of a
different conception of the higher interests
of Canada.
For example, the people of Ontario show
their loyalty according to the educational
leadership they have received. These teachings and this education have endowed them
with a certain mentality with certain beliefs
which are revealed in their way of viewing
national and even international problems. Ai
this time the contrary viewrpoint has been
taught and permitted to be taught in the
province of Quebec, with the result that we
have there, with different beliefs, a body of
opinion which nevertheless remains sincere
and logical. The people responsible for this
situation are the leaders, those who have
sought to derive personal benefit therefrom.
Those who are acquainted with our contemporary history will understand that in saying
this I do net intend to place the blame on
one political party more than on the other,
for, if the truth be told, both have erred considerably in this respect. However, even if I
do net share their opinions on military imperialism, I place well above the political
gamblers of every stripe these men whose firm
beliefs lead them to risk their careers in the
fulfilling of what they consider to be their
duty. I cao easily understand that a Canadian
of pure English stock should have a very high
regard for England and the British Empire.
He has every reason te. Notwithstanding 300
years of separation, despite the disappointments and the cold indifference France showed
us at times, I still feel the few drops of her
blood that pulse through my veins quicken
whenever her fortunes soar or decline. And
that is why I can understand the even stronger
ties that bind English Canadians to their
Mother Country, whose power has ruled the
world.
On the other Iand, is it so difficult to understand that those who have learned to be
Canadians before all else should wish to devote
aIl their attention, all their strength and care
ta the defence of their country, while recognizing the majesty of England's century-old
power, her claims and her rights?

Dormesson has so ably put it, no nation is
isolated in this world, and the national aims
of a people cannot be parmanently achieved
save through compromise with the acceptable
aims of other peoples. This principle we recognize in the field of political economics. But is
it not one of the reasons for our limited participation in the present conflict? We have
known ever since the signing of the reciprocity
agreement by Britain, Canada and the United
States, that President Roosevelt would eventually declare war on the Axis powers.
The French Canadians. I must confess, are
not without their faults. The truth of this
statement lias never been dirmmed by repetition. They pay for their own mistakes. Yet
a close analysis of the causes that brought
about this war and of the principal mistakes
made prior to and since the opening of hostilities in no way points to the French Canadians as those responsible for the war, for
the reverses suffered by the Allies, or for
delaying a British victory. Let us he honest
with each other. Are the criticisms voiced by
the French Canadians as violent as those
heard in England itself since the opening of
the war? Not at all!
The French Canadian remains honestly
attached to his conception of pure Canadianism, as well as to his beliefs based on the
teachings tbat have shaped his mind. He
remains. as in 1774 and in 1812, a true Canadian. He remains a Canadian because, in the
first place, he deply loves bis country, and
also because lie still follows the advice given

and duties of the Canadian citizen in the
British Empire, in war as in peace. Once this
definition were recognized, had become constitutional and legal, it could have been taught
in every school in the nation. True, it was
not to impede the natural and logical evolution of the country. The aim was to teach
all the true meaning of Canadian responsibility and Canadian spirit. Coming from a
rural district, my plea went unnoticed. If this
suggestion had been acted upon, the Canadian people would now find themselves much
better equipped to deal with the problem
of our national interests, with which bas been
coupled that of the Empire. They would be
much better prepared to consider wherein lie
our national interests, commercial or economie.
We sbould be spared the sight of political
acrobaties which blur our vision and trouble
our minds. We should not be labouring under
the burden of thirty years of broken promises,
pledges and commitments. We should not
have to fear a dangerous distrust of the
Government, so prevalent among the people.
We should have been spared, in time of war,
the siglît of a fanatically partisan administration cf incompetent budget-makers who have
wasted billions of the savings of our small
population, without seriously providing for our
efficient defence.
Why should the lessons,
the examples, of the last war have served only
to increase expenditures and internal division?
Had we wisely expended for the defence of
Canada the sums which the inexperience and
inefficiency have cost us since the beginning
of the war, would our unpreparedness be as
great as it is to-day? Would our people
be taxed to the limit? I do not believe so.
It lias been found preferable in certain
quarters to exploit the military problem in
an opposite sense, and to give on either hand
to Imperialism certain distorted, exaggerated
and detestable mcanings, which are dividing
instead of uniting the nation. This bas been

JULY 28, 1942
The present measure violates the solemn
agreement of which Mr. King and Mr.
Lapointe were the main authors, an agreement endorsed by all sections of the Government party and, to be honest, by the entire
Canadian people in 1940; an agreement made
public the day after the close of the provincial
election campaign in Quebec, which had been
directed by Mr. Lapointe and Mr. Cardin,
strongly upheld by the Prime Minister and
his colleagues and without regard for the
autonomy of the Provincial Legislature, against
the autonomous ýGovernment of that province. Mr. Ernest Lapointe stated everywhere:
"If you vote for Duplessis I shall resign with
my Quebec colleagues from the Cabinet, and
that will mean conscription."
Lapointe's
voice prevailed and the Duplessis Government was evicted in favour of a Liberal
administration. Ernest Lapointe is no more,
and bis voice is for ever stilled. Soon after
bis death, attempts were made to sully bis
memory and a great deal of disdain was
shown for bis pledges. The fact that all
those who accepted Lapointe's word are not
dead bas apparently been overlooked.. Yet
for giving this pledge Lapointe had been
proclaimed a great man and been covered with
praise in British and Empire newspapers.
During the 1940 federal election every province of Canada wished to hear and acclaim
him as the "creator of national unity."
The French Canadians who believed in the
pledge, in the solemn promise given them
that there would be no conscription, a commitment made by men who could not have
forgotten our bitter experience in that respect
during the Great War, the French Canadians,
I repeat, can no longer follow the leadership
of politicians who have so thoroughly deceived them, and who should bear any blame
attached to the people's opposition to this
measure. For my part, I openly opposed conscription during the last war for the same
reasons my fello'w-citizens then advanced-a
course of action I intend to follow at this
juncture.
My opposition is perhaps even
stronger this time, owing to the fact that the
present measure is far worse than that of
1917, as Messrs. Cardin, Raymond and others
have publicly admitted. After the war of
1914-18, did not Sir Robert Borden declare
that Canada could not repeat so strenuous
an effort? Yet, although the present war is
not over, we have already sustained in effort
three times as great. Other English-speaking
Canadians have opposed conscription in this
House and elsewhere, have even opposed our
participation in another war.
There can be no question of spreading
defeatism and helping the enemy. The French
Canadians are ready to do even more for

King and country and to help the Allied
cause. Since the Hong Kong disaster millions
of 'Chinese are asking to be supplied, not with
men, but with arms and munitions to fight
the enemy. China bas 400 million inhabitants
and Canada 12 millions, of whom five only
are engaged in production work.
It is wrong to assume and to repeat that
the French Canadians are the only ones
opposed to conscription as advocated by the
extremist faction or as introduced by this
half-explained Government measure.
It is
equally wrong to believe that the French
Canadians alone object to the principle of
conscription for service outside our territory.
It is wrong to proclaim that they are not doing
their share, while representatives of every
province hold in Parliament that voluntary
enlistments represent an effort surpassing all
forecasts. Has not the scope of our war effort
brought us praise from our Allies? It has
brought us statements of appreciation, much
Winston
flattering
.perhaps, from
too
Churchill, Lord Halifax and Malcohn MacDonald, speaking on behalf of Britain.
Anyone interested in locating the essential
faults in our military organization need not
look at the voluntary , system nor at the
French Canadians. Let him search elsewhere,
among the incompetent officials who hold down
jobs they are not fitted for. Are there no
French Canadians serving overseas? The 22nd
Battalion, which won great distinction in the
last war, was made up of volunteers, not conscripts.
Has not French Canada's share in the war
effort been called admirable? Tndeed, numerous and brave are our young men in the
fighting ranks, numerous and efficient our
workers in Canadian war plants, despite the
discrimination and prejudice shown in army
and factory pay lists. For them no sabotage
nor strikes. If there occurs the beginning of a
strike, it is simply because the workers demand higher wages, commensurate with their
responsibilities, the risks they run and the
provision to be made for their future. If there
is an abortive strike, it is due to the fact
that the authorities delay too long in granting
the workers a fair treatment, a treatment in
accordance with human dignity and interest.
Intolerable injustices do occur, and those responsible should correct them before Canada
and her Allies have to bear the consequences.
'Our French Canadian farmer nobly responds
to the appeal for a greater production effort.
He only asks that bis sons be left on the land
in order to increase its yield and to produce
more food-stuffs for England, her Allies and
our own men overseas. That is why our
farmers have demanded the setting up of

SENATE

county courts to pass equitably on exemption
or deferment requests. They simply want to
submit their requests to conscientious men,
well acquainted with conditions prevailing in
the district. They are complaining at present
of the lack of such understanding and of the
fact that their help is being drafted away at
the height of the harvest season.
I do not wish to be unfair to the Government nor to hinder in the least a decent war
effort on our part, but it seems to me, and to
many others no doubt, that a voluntary system
organized in such a way as to make the best
use of our man-power in every field of activity,
both as regards our war and our post-war
needs, remains the best solution of this problem. If there is waste and lack of co-ordination, it is not the soldier's fault, nor that of
any group of workers.
Pressure in the most revolting form has
been brought to bear on our young men to
have them enlist for overseas service, without
the introduction of a conscription measure.
The object was to enforce a disguised and
illegal form of conscription.
All this has
embittered our people to the point where
they unhesitatingly prefer the Act of 1917,
whose purpose was more clearly and frankly
set forth.
Freedom of speech commanded more respect
in 1917 than it does to-day. Contradiction
and lack of balance, of judgment and of
efficiency are everywhere noticeable. Parliament is dcprived of information it should
posses

as the sovereign representative of the

people, on the ground that such information
might benefit the enemy. At the same time
radio and newspaper dispatches stress the
increasing devxelopment and importance of
our war production.
The enemy is practically invited over for bombing practice,
while the employees demand protection.
As I Pave already said, I am opposed to the
principle of conscription because I have
alvays fought military imperialisn, detesting
the quarrels of the Old World and its military
aspirations.
I am even more opposed to
this amendmeni. first because the Government fears to state clearly the purpose of
this mcasure and the mianner in which it will
be applied once passed; then because the
Minister of Agriculture (Hon. Mr. Gardiner)
has said he fears that the present reduction
in man-power will affect our essential production: lastly, because the Minister of Munitions foresees an increasing labour shortage
in armament plants.
Even if I were in favour of conscription
I would oppose tbis amendment because,
lacking frankness and sincerity, it is danHon. Mr. SAUVE.

gerous; because the Government in violating
its pledges, in multiplying its mistakes and in
refusing to face our problems squarely, stands
as an increasing source of danger and useless
expense.
Having been deceived once, we
have cause to fear that it may happen again.
The Prime Minister's attitude before, during
and after the plebiscite is a sad spectacle.
His treatment of a former colleague, Hon.
NIr. Cardin. is another.
I feel that I must say this, although I
have for the Prime Minister, as be is well
aware, a bigh personal regard. I sympathize
with him for the position in which he now
finds bimsolf, forced to reap in sadness the
grain he sowed in the hey-day of power.
Here we have a Minister of the Crown
who urges bis fellow-citizens to vote in the
affirmative on the plebiscite question, and
gives tbem his word of honour that it does
not entail conscription.
Yet on the very
next dav after the vote the Government
introduces a Bill requesting authority to
enforce conscription. After hearing his leader
explain the consequences of this measure in
Cabinet Council, this Minister tenders his
resignation, adding that the Bill means conscription anid that be does net approve of it.
A few da vs later we hear the Prime Minister
state to the louse: "MY colleague did not
indie rstand this amenimient.'
Not a very
flattering reiark to make about a member
Nwith thirty years of parliamentary experience
bebind himt. The Prime Minister then added:
"This Bill moans, net necessarily conscription, but conscriptien only if it becomes
nocessary." How can we consider as serious
and appropriate a declaration of this kind
coming from a Prime Minister responsible
to the people? The ruse is transparent. It is
clear that the Prime Minister did not dare
to explain the seriousness of his amendment.
Why maintain this equivocal attitude?
I stand opposed to conscription because I
Io not wish to betray my fellow-citizens,
because I have no desire te deceive them, and
because the Government refuses to give us any
assurances in the matter. I oppose this policy
of 'conscription becattse conscription for the
defence of Canada has given rise to a general
discrimination against French
Canadians.
Many are the justified complaints the honourable Messrs. Lapointe, Cardin, Power and
Ralston have received with growing alarm. I
am opposed to conscription because in refusing
to betray my compatriots I also refuse to
betray this country. Far be it from me to
abandon them to their fate because I no longer
have any political axe to grind. I am opposed
to conscription because I find it unfair that

JULY 28, 1942
fathers and mothers should be made ta give
up

their sons, when

the

authorities

have

repeatedly told them, even since the opening
of the conflict, that it would not be necessary.
These authorities who, even in the light of
past experience, did not hesitate to foster
among the people a hostile attitude towards
military participation in external wars, towards

every form of militarism and conscription,
must bear their responsibilities. They are to
be found, not in one racial group only, but
in the two which form the Government, and

the larger and more blameworthy element is
not the French Canadian.
To my mind, a better organized voluntary

system such as Australia boasts would furnish
even more satisfactory results. I think that
te push enlistment figures over and above
a certain percentage limit would merely result

in a labour shortage and endanger production
facilities that our Allies are depending on now,
and that our people will depend on after this
war. I feel that before we go beyond such a

limit our people should be better informed
as to our present military organization for the

defence (in Canada) of our territory. I am
all the more opposed to this coercive measure
because the Government refuses to be anything but a party organization, and to adopt
anything like the national viewpoint that the
need of national unity would command.

We are reminded to-day that Russia, China
and even England are clamouring for munitions and more munitions, for guns, planes,
ships, tanks and destroyers. Why should we
be asked underhandedly to sacrifice our youth?
Why not come out into the open? If no one
dares te do this, why should we believe that
the need is very urgent? As I said before,
the French Canadians, like all others, are ready
to work night and day to produce munitions
and food-stuffs. Is that an example of defeatism? Is that a refusal to participate in the
war? Let the Government continue, but with
system, to give the French Canadians the
task of increasing production, and they will
undertake with a will to produce everything
this country and its Allies need, provided of
course that they are granted reasonable working conditions and a fair wage, and that their
employers do not wait until the eve of a strike
to give them their just due. It is not always
labour that is responsible for strikes. The

Government should see to it that justice is
done to the employees as well as to the
employer. The real saboteurs of our war
effort are not always those whom the Government condemns.
The need of replacements for those of our
troops who fall on overseas battle-fields has
been stressed. Although I am particularly
impressed by this consideration, and I have

3E.

personal reasons for wishing to give the greatest
possible protection to our troops overseas, I
do not think the argument peremptory. This
argument, to my mind, would be much stronger
if it were demonstrated that the other Allied
nations had already done more than their
share in that respect-a share proportionate
to their total population and to the importance of their position-and that their manpower reserves were consequently depleted.
Instead of sending soldiers to Hong Kong,
it would have been much better for us to
supply the Chinese with the munitions they
so badly need. When any of our young men
voluntarily agree to risk their lives, I can only
bow before their determination and pray God
to bless their courage and to grant victory to
their arms. But our most efficient contribution
as well as our best protection is, I repeat, the
production of munitions and food-stuffs. There
is the urgent need. We must dedicate ourselves to supplying the Allies wi.th food and
improved equipment and ammunition. To
this end we must, as far as possible, keep our
sons on the land and in the factory instead
of turning upside down, of weakening these
two production factors, and replacing experienced men with apprentices and inexperienced
women who will ruin their health before the
war is out. It is still on the land and in the
factory that our youth .can give the best
account of themselves in the Allied cause.
Honourable senators, I have just expressed
my opinion on this subject, an opinion which
is shared, I believe, by my fellow-citizens. I
think it is necessary, even urgent, in the
interest of order in this country, that public
men should show a great deal of care in their
teachings and in the pledges they give to the
people. The respect which a man in public
life must have stems from his own respect for
himself and for his fellow-citizens.
One of the greatest church orators in France,
Massillon, said of the princes and the great of
his country:
Their very rank which singles them out
presents them as models, and their morals will
soon shape public morals: the crowd knows no
other law than the example of those who
command; their lives are reproduced, so to
speak, in those of the masses, and if their vices
find crities it is generally among those who
foster them.
Hon. ELIE BEAUREGARD: Honourable
senators, I should like to make a few very
brief remarks to substantiate my opposition to
this Bill. I shall not deal at any length with
Conscription Bill No. 1, which was in operation during World War No. 1. We heard on
that subject a very distinguished historian, a
man who knew so much about it that he
refused at that time a seat in the Senate in

j14

SENATE

order to avoid having anything to do with it.
We heard also from some of the makers of that
piece of legislation. They showed no repentance; they just said: "Come on in, the water
is fine." While listening to the very sad story
of that period I was reminded of the cunning
fox of LaFontaine, who had lost his hairy tail
in some fox-and-chicken war, and who nearly
succeeded in convincing the younger members
of his tribe that he was better off without it.
I shall deal only with Conscription Bill No.
2. of World War No. 2, which is more
familiar to me. Bill 80 is said to be the logical
consequence of the plebiscite, and nothing
else. Both the Government and its die-hard
opponents agree on that.
They are the
majority; therefore they must be right. The
plebiscite obviously was offered as a compromise between the conscriptionists and the
anti-conscriptionists.
As such it displeased
evervbody. No bill ever had such a bad press.
The plebiscite was not to be confused with
a referendum, the result of which would have
been binding; nevertheless, the Government
was not indifferent to the answer to the
piliebit, ancd enlid for a "Yes" vote. The
Government's object was to be relieved of a
solemn pledge net to impose conscription for
overseas during the present war, and the question was drafted accordingly. The voters
were repeatedly warned that they must not be
nfluenced by what might follow an affirmative
vote, and that a negative vote might well be
taken as a vote of non-confidence and be
acted upon as such. They were repeatedly
warned not to confuse the issues, to wit, conscription-which was in everybody's mindand the mere relieving of the Government
of its pledge. One step at a time.
The proposal of such a plebiscite was
branded by tho conscriptionists as a farce.
They were dead against consulting the electors. The fact that the word "conscription"
was not inserted in the ballot appeared to
them to be a manouvre to delay ceonsideration
of the issue. On the other hand, up to the
time when they were as sure as one can be
that there would be no change in the wording
of the ballot, they did not strongly press the
point. Their only solace was to notice that
the Government showed signs of weakness.
Conscription, which up to then had been
vetoed, at last appeared to be a possibility.
This was a matter of satisfaction to conscriptionists, who do not shun politics in time
of war.
As time went on it was noticed that a fair
proportion of Liberals were likely to vote
"Yes" through heer confidence in the Premier.
Then they rallied to the idea of a plebiscite
and numbers of thema under the command of
Hon.

Mr. BEAUREGARD.

conscriptionist No. 1 started to campaign
alongside the Government for a "Yes" vote.
The Government campaigners did net always
agree as to the consequences of an affirmative
vote, but the Left had unity of command
and action.
As soon as the result of the ballot was
known, long before the official returns were
tabled, they-you know whom I mean-had
forgotten all about the wording of the bulletin
and the warnings of the Prime Minister. For
all purposes the vote was treated as an affirmative vote on conscription. They Lad been
unable to establish the necessity of conscription; past experience and the figures as to
available man-power were against thcm; but
it did not matter any more, since the will of
the majority secured under such circumstances
was

mianifest.

The plebiscite bas become their only argument. The Crusaders had a mette: "It is the
will of God." Modern Crusaders have changed
it to this: "It is the will of the majority."
"Vae victis!" They do not pray aey moro
for conscription: they exact it as a right,
and ihey succecd. Obviously the Covernment
bas heeded the pressure, since this Bill 80
was introduced with the sbortest possible deiay
as the logical consequence of the plebiscite.
The hand of the Government does not appear
any freer than it was before the plchiscite was
held. There is a change in the nature of the
impediment. The latter one is, to say the
Ieast, just as strong as the former.
Consciiptionists have turned defeat into
victory.
Those who voted "No" have a
solatium doloris. They may say, "We knew it."
The only ones left in the dark are those who,
like myself, voted "Yes" in all good faith, on
the strength of the question. Those are tho
real losers. "In nedio stat virtus" bas failed
to prove true.
In medio stand the losers, their
only solace the conviction that it is sheer folly
to take another chance on this paramount
question
of conscription, and that this
amîendiient should be accepted as verbal and
insignificant.

Consci îptionists are now on the war path.
They are not to be satisfied with this first
success. True, as soon as Bill 80 receives the
royal assent recruits for local defence mîay
be sent abroad. Those already incorporated
in regiments intended for service overseas will
naturally follow their regiment. But it is not
enough. This Government bas practised conscription for local defence by instalments. It
may be inclined. in order to save goat and
cabbage, te follow the same process even
after conscription for overseas service is the
law of the land. What is needed, since the

is securing as time goes on. In order to
induce the Government to release figures
they go on repeating time and again that
voluntary enlistment is a failure. They contend that to retard conscription for overseas

Unofficial critics abuse the province of
Quebec, btcause they want to see more Quebeckers in, khaki. Let us enforce conscription
for Canada and American outposts, and there
will be no more cause for complaints. Unofficial
critics have gone so far as to characterize
as traitors those who in Parliament have
opposed the principle of this Bill.
Such
abuse against parliimentarians of English
tradition should have raised vehement protest froui both sides of the lHouse. With two
or three notable exceptions ther
was no
protest.
Here niay I digress to pay a compliment
to the honourable senator from Wellington
(Hon. Mr. Howard) on being an Englishman

To the best of my knowledge, even some

and silence are two equally powerful weapons.
Wide publicity was given to the promoters
and supporters of this Bill, while space and
place were measured out to the opposition
group. In the meantime readers are invited
to believe that to support the Prime Minister
on Bill 80 is the best way to evade or retard
conscription. On this point, but, I am afraid,
on this point alone, they agree with the
honourable senator from Ottawa East (Hon.
Mr. Coté).
I do net know of any case submitted to
the consideration of a tribunal or a body of
legislators that bas been carried through with
less evidence in support of it. A good half of
the speeches of the most eminent supporters
of this Bill in the other House would justify
a negative verdict.

Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. BEAUREGARD.

Hcn. Mr. BEAUREGARD: This law is a
concession to sentiment against logic. That is
why it will be adopted without shadow of
justification. Conscription is not necessary,
but we may as well adopt it since it is likely
to please the majority.
The Government has changed its slogan.
The first was "No conscription." The new
one is "Conscription if necessary." The words
"if necessar-y," in my humble opinion, do net
add much in the present case. Who bas ever
avowed that he would faveur conscrintion
that would net be necessary? "Conscription"
1m 0e word and "Conscription if necessary,"
in three words, are identical. If the solemn
pledge was one binding the Government net
te impose unnecessary conscription, it was no
pledge at al, and therefore the pledge was
no impediment to carrying on conversations
withs the heads of the Allied countries.
My regrets are futile, but how can a good
Liberal of the minority race help regretting
rhat the Liberal party may be instrumental
mo forging a law which may bring about
disunion, thereby endangering not only the war
effort, but aiso the very life of the country?
A good French Canadian Liberal cannot escape
a feeling of regret that the shadow of the
defeated chief of the Left bas overcome the
great shadow of Laurier standing erect on
the terrace of Parliament.
I am tihrougi.
The principle of this Bill
is bad because the least we can sav is that
the Bill is useless. It provides for nothing
we cannot bave by voluotary enlistment for
service overseas coupled with conscription
for se-v ice in Canada and American outposts.
It is bad because it is liable to croate friction
and raciali hatred. It is bad because past
experience shows that it is costly and inefficient. It is ill-timed because it comes on
the norrow of the plebiscite.
Voters were
warncd net to be influenced by what might
follow an affirmative vote. It looks as if the
Government had net leeded its own warning.
Rightly or wrongly, the plebiscite was heralded
as a plebiscite on conscription. Just because
the plebiscite was so heralded by powerful
groups before tise Bill was brought down, this
Bill should net have been introduced on the
sole ground of logical consequence. It may
be the only logical thing in this wiole scheme,
but for once logic is out of place.
At six o'clock the Senate took recess.

I call attention, honourable senators, to
what the leader of that party said in June
last in connection with this proposal:
Since the Government is seeking power for
the final step in the conscription of man-power
for overseas, now is the time ta demand that
these principles be put into effect.
And only the other day, after the presentation
of the Budget, which contained probably the
most drastic measures ever imposed on this
side of the Atlantic for the conscription of
wealtb, as it is popularly understood, the
leader of that party said:
We voted against the second reading of the
Government's Bill on the ground I have stated.
We supported the Budget, it is truc, in spite of
our dislike of some of its features. We supported that Budget because in this war we
have never denied at any time the funds that
the Goveronient needed ta carry on the war.
What does that mean, honourable senators?
It simply means that these men have said:
"So far as money is concerned, we will vote
it to carry on the war; but if you need men
ta carry on the war we will not vote for that
purpose unless you grant what we demand."
I should not have any complaint as to the
conduct of these honourable gentlemen if they
had said, "We are opposing this Bill because
we are against conscription." They have not
said that. I should not have criticized their
conduct if they had said, "We are against this
Bill because conscription is not necessary."
But they have nat said that. I should not
have criticized them if they had said, "Collaterally to this proposai we also bring forward
other measures, which we think ought to be
adopted." But what they say is: "No matter
how essential this may be for the ultimate
defence of the country, we will not grant it
except on the condition that you pay our
price and let us start on the road to Socialism." I think, honourable senators, that that
should be considered at this time along with
what this party said in the House of Commons on September 9, 1939, when war was

leader and now the leader of the Co-operative
Commonwealth Federation, said this:
Nevertheless, the Co-operative Commonwealth
Federation recognizes that Canada is now implicated in a struggle which may involve the
survival of democratic institutions.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS.

I emphasize that, honourable senators, to show
that this party cannot plead to-day, "We did
not realize what we were faced with when our
then acting leader made this further statement."
In view of these considerations, the Cooperative Commonwealth Federation believes
that Canada's policy should be based first on
the fundamental national interests of the Canadian people, as well as on their interest in the
outeome of war. Canada should be prepared
to defend her own shores, but her assistance
overseas should be limited to economic aid and
must not include conscription of man-power or
the sending of any expeditionary force.
He enumerated four propositions, the third
and fourth of which I will now read:
3. No military participation overseas: Any
attempt to send a force abroad would rob us
of the man-power necessary for the defence of
our shores and for home pioduction, would
gravely endanger national unmty, would threaten
our civil liberties and democratic institutions,
and would ultimatelv lead to conscription.
4. Preservation of democracy at home: The
Co-operative Commonwealth Federation protests
against the encroachments on our civil liberties

honourable senators, in September nearly three
years ago.
and insists that democracy at home must be
preserved unnimpaired during the war.
It was worrving about democracv at home,
so far as our Covernment's orders were
concerned, but utterly inconsiderate of the
survival of democracy, for which the people of
this country would have to fight with their
man-power.
I noticed in the papers to-day that this
party is having a convention and is sending an
organizer into the province of Quebec. This
party, which stands for Socialism, is to make
an appeal in the province of Quebec for what?
I believe it will not get much of a reception
if it tells the people of that province, "Our
policy was that not.a single Canadian soldier.
volunteer or conscript, should go abroad. and
to-day our policy is that no matter how badly
our country may need mon for overseas service
in its hour of greatest peril, our price for our
support of the Government's action in supplying this need is the adoption of our Socialistie
doctrine." I call attention to this, honourable
senators, because I consider it to be one of the
serious situations that ought to be recognized
in this country.
Now we come to the attitude of the Conservative- party. As I follow it, partly from
what has been said in this House and partly
from what has been said elsewhere, the
criticism is directed, not against the Bill as
such, for most honourable members of the
party will support the Bill, but against the

JULY 28, 1942
Government's policy, and particularly against
the Prime Minister. It is contended that our
total war effort requires conscription for overseas now, or required it sooner.
The
criticism that has been made is, first, that
action should have been taken without a
plebiscite, and, secondly, that since a plebiscite
was taken, with the result that we all know,
a Bill for conscription, rather than the present
measure, should have been introduced in Parliament; and, in the third place, the criticism
takes the form of prediction of delay in the
future.
So, as I see it, the controversy boils down
to this question: Is conscription necessary?
At this stage, honourable senators, I want to
say that I have felt a great sense of satisfaction at the temper and high tone of the discussions on this Bill in the Senate.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: If I should get a little
warm to-night, please blame it on the hot
weather and not on my attitude in regard to
anything that hais been said in this House,
for I feel that the discussion here might well
be an example to other places and parts of
Canada.
I would ask consideration of this question of
conscription from two standpoints. I see no
other way of approaching it in my own process of reasoning. The first is this, that as
an abstract principle it is the correct way to
select men for national service. If I do not
appear somewhat egotistical, I should like to
submit my own view in that regard. Many
honourable members in this House, including
a number on this side, do not hold this view.
It is this, that when we are in a war in which
the existence of the State is threatened and
the freedom and safety of our citizens are in
danger, conscription is the proper method of
selecting people for service at home and
abroad.
Hon. C. P. BEAUBIEN: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE:

Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. FARRIS: Perhaps honourable
senators will not altogether approve of my
attitude when I have fully explained it. I
say, other things being equal, that is in my
conception the sound principle on which to
approach this question. In my opinion, the
thing being examined in an abstract way,
voluntary enlistment is very much like voluntary taxation. In this country to-day we have
compulsory taxation. When we pay our share

of taxes we are satisfied, in one sense at least,
for we know that no matter how much it hurts
us to do so, the money is needed, and that, so
far as is humanly possible, all pay alike. But if

319

we had volntary taxation what would be the
feeling? Some people would do their duty,
some would do more than their duty, and some
would do nothing at all. The result would be
inefficiency, dissatisfaction and resentment.
What I am about to say now I have pasted
on my notes from a statement I made in a
broadcast during the plebiscite. There is about

this word "conscription" a prejudice which is
not justified. The literal meaning of the
word is, "The act of writing down on paper-

an enrolment." Conscription of men, in short,
therefore is the orderly system of writing
down the list of men who are available for war
service and other services, and then after the
enrolment is complete it involves proceeding

in an intelligent way to select those who
from age, physical qualifications and freedom
from family ties should be the first to go, and
to decide, on the same basis, the time when
each man's turn should come. This should
be donc, not by guess-work, but intelligently,
according to established rules set up by competent public authority in the interest of the
State and according to the ordinary principles
of fair play. It should be regarded, not as
compulsion, but as intelligent and practical
selection. The theory is based on the assumption that every man who is a worthy citizen
is willing to serve, but that the State should
say who should serve, and when and where
he should serve. It is logical, it is fair, it is
democratic and it is efficient.
But when I say that, honourable senators,
I have not said all there is to be said about
conscription in the Dominion of Canada in the
year 1942. As every honourable senator knows,
what we are confronted with in this country is
not a theory, but a practical condition. If
it vas merely a case of theory, we should have
had, from the very day the war began, conscription based on this principle of selective
service imposed by the State. But no one,
certainly no one who was vocal, was in favour
of conscription when war was declared.

Hon. Mr. HORNER: Yes; W. D. Herridge
was.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: I was going to quote a
maxim that lawyers sometimes cite, "De

minimis," and so on. But the gentleman
referred to is not here, and it would not be
fair to make comments of that kind.

Broadly speaking, at the time of the election in 1940 the leaders of the major parties
in Canada, no matter what their private views
as to the theory of conscription may have
been, feIt that we should not have conscription in Canada.

Hon. C. P. BEAUBIEN: That is right.

SENATE
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: There was a reason for
that. And I ask of honourable senators and
others whio have changed their position, "Why
is conscription demanded now by those who
were against it a short time ago?" The answer
is an obvious one, namely, that we did not
consider ct necessary then, but we do consider it necessary now. I think that would be
accepted as the answer. To my mind it is a
fair answer, if it is correct.
So the whole issue in these circumstances,
as I sec it, comes down to this question:
My
is conscription necessary? "
"When
answer to that is this. In Canada, conscription is necessary when thereby our total war
effort is better served. Think that aver, honourable senators, and see if it does net meet
the test. Conscription is necessary in Canada
when thereby our total war effort is better
served. That is not confined to the question:
"Will you get more men to-morrow by conscription than you will by voluntary enlistment?" That extends to a survey of the
entire field. Are we prepared to ask, as a
government must: "Will the war effort be
better served?" When that question is asked,
and is answered affirmatively, I can see no
course other than that conscription must be
introduced.
I would ask you to consider the question
I have formulated in the light of three things:
first, experience; second, present conditions;
third, our immediate future.
I do net intend to speak at length about
the past, and I shall not refer to it in any
spirit of recrimination. There were stronger
differenices between some of us who were here
in 1917, and enough time has gone by for
every one of us to respect and honour the
views which others had at that time. Let me
recall the situation in the early spring of 1917,
when Sir Robert Borden returned from
England. He reported to his colleagues and
to Canada that replacements necessary for our
men overseas, who had been in the thick of the
fighting for some time, were not being secured
by the voluntary system. It was estimated
that there must as soon as possible be at
least 70,000 men sent overseas. I have before
me Sir Robert Borden's Memoirs. There are
many things Sir Robert could have said, and
some he did say. Here is a passage I think
it worth while to bring to the attention of
honourable members:
In all my experience I never encountered so
extraordinary a political atmosphere as that
which prevailed during that summer and
autumn. The varying phases of patriotic sentiment and fervour, of racial prejudice and
animosity, the rumeurs and counter-rumours
often finding credence although wholly absurd,
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN.

the alternation of hesitation and distrust with
frankness and confidence, the advances and
recessions in the loosening or rending of party
affiliations, the lack of balance and comprehension and the fluctuating moods affecting the
attitude of outstanding figures, created a
political kaleidoscope which even one who was
in the midst of all the turmoil finds it difficult

to recall in some of its constantly changing
features.
That comes from the man who was at the
head of the Government which brought in
conscription. He never writes, so far as I
have noticed, in extravagant terms. He makes
a moderate statement of the very serious
condition which existed in this country at that
time. My colleague fror Vancouver (Hon.
Mr. McRae) said this afternoon: "There are
But he will agree
no yesterdays to-day."
with me that there would be no to-days if
there were no yesterdays, and there would be
no progress or advancement if to-day we did
not learn from our yesterdays. Sir Robert
Borden is one authority I desired to quote
simply to refresh honourable senators' minds.
There are members here who could stand up
and make a much stronger statement than
that and be well within bounds in describing
the conditions which then existed.
Then I call attention to what the honourable gentleman from Grandville (Hon. Sir
Thomas Chapais) yesterday afternoon quoted,
in part, from Dr. Skelton's book. I think it
will bear citing again, with some comments.
He spoke of what had been predicted and
expected, and then be continued:
Yet the legions promised did not appear. The
first shock of the sanguine supporters of the
Act came when it was found that of the 404,000
of the first class, unmarried men from twenty
to thirty-four, who had registered by the end
of 1917, 380,000 had claimed exemption; the
next, with the announcement that there were
118,000 claims for exemption from Ontario as
against 115,000 from Quebec (out of 125,000 and
117,000 registrants). Local tribunals, particularly in Quebee, were charged with being
farcically lax; on the other hand, the military
representatives appealed nearly every exemption in Quebec, but allowed 90,000 in Ontario
to go unopposed. Exemptions were reviewed by
the appeal judges and later by Justice Duff;
by the end of March,-that is 1918-some 364,000 out of 372,000 cases had been
decided. In Quebec 108,000 exemptions had been
finally approved, and in Ontario 104,000. Sir
Robert Borden had insisted in June-that is June of 1917it was absolutely essential to have

70,000 men by December 31, 1917. By March
31, 1918, the number ordered to report for
duty was only 31,000 of whom 5,000 defaulted,
the net yield being less than 26,000. Supporters
of conscription were slow to admit its failure,
but in the face of this breakdown criticism could

how far our war effort is to be advanced
we must consider as essential the unity
of Canada. I proceed on this with some
hesitation, not because of any lack in my
own belief, but because it is so easy for anyone
who makes a statement in a situation of
this kind to be misunderstood.
I say it
wild be very unfortunate if the French Canadian minority in this country are made to
feel that they have been forced into overseas
conscription unnecessarily or unfairly. I for
one am a firm believer in the proposition
that every reasonable effort ought to be made
to avert any such situation, and I say, still
sticking to my text of the advancement of
our war effort, that I for my part am prepared to give the Prime Minister credit for
being prompted by that purpose and not
by mere political maneuvering.
I call attention to the speech which Mr.
Cardin made in another place only the other
day. I beard that speech, and I think there
were some fine things in it.
In many
particulars I did not agree with it. That is
not to be wondered at. He said:

I do not agree with that expression. I should

"before

I continue:
Exercise your authority. you members of the
majority, but with kindness, not in Hitler's or
Mussolini's way. Exercise it in such a way
that the feelings of those upon whom you
exercise it by the force of num.bers are not
hurt too deeply.

That statement, which I have read from
Hansard, is quoted in the Montreal Gazette
of a day or so ago. After quoting it, the
Gazette concludes as follows:
The Gazette lias been severcly critical of Mr.
Cardin in the past, notably of his w ithdrawal
from the Cabinet at a moment and under circumstances that seemeed to make the "Yes"
campaign in this province a mockery. But we
pay tribute, nonetheless, to the dignity of the
appeal above quoted, which spokesmen of the
majority may well take to hcart.
Now, having said that, honourable senators,
I have not yet said enough. I have declared
for a principle that I believed in. I have
pointed out how necessary it may be under
Hon. Mr. FARRIS.

certain conditions to be practical and sensible
and fair. I should not want to force my
opinions down the throat of any other person.
But there may come a situation where, as
Mr. RaIston, I think it was, said-I am speaking from memory-"There may be too big a
price to pay for unity."
Hon. Mr. LACASSE: What is that?
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: "There may be too
big a price to pay for unity." We must agree
that that may be se. I would go further and
would put it this way: it is possible to pay
a price for unity which will defeat the purpose desired.
I have already said that it
will be a blow to unity if the French Canadian
minority are made to feel that they have been
forced into overseas conscription unnecessarily
and unfairly. But I add a counterpart of that
statement. I say it will be an even more
disastrous blow to Canadian unity if the
majority in Canada are led to believe that
their will has been thwarted by the French
Canadian minority and that this has been
detrimental to our war effort. Now, honourable senators, do net misunderstand that
statement. I have made it very carefully.
If they were led to believe that, and consequences followed, I think it would be the mnost
serious situation that could happen in Canada,
and I think our French Canadian friends
would be the first to agree that that is se.
We are talking of necessity. There is such
a thing, honourable senators. as an emotional
necessity. It may be brought about by too
muci irresponsible talk on the part of
extremists on either side, or on both sides.
You and I know, honourable senators, that
in some part of Canada-not in this Housethat is true. The appearance in a newspaper
in the province of Quebec of an irresponsible
statement by some man in my province who
would not be listened to out there, will do
untold harm. We know also that someone
in the province of Quebec may make statements which, if quoted in other parts of
Canada, would have the sane result. In such
conditions yeu are heading towards what I
have termed an emotional necessity.
This will never happen if we can keep the
discussion of this question on the plane that
it Las occupied in this House. So I would

this controversy ever came up-as a professionel man who went tbrough two universities,
and who bas a string of degrees Vo his nerne,
some earned and sorne unearned, I feel tbat
it is a reflection on myself that I do not
understand both official languages of my
country. I tbink there is a wholes9me trutb
i.n wbet was said by Mr. Justice Harrison.
Every man in this Chamber or outside of
it who is pondering over tbe question, which
in the last analysis must be left to tbis Govment, "Is conscription necessary?" must make
sure thet the dernend of miilitary necessity is
made in the light of ahl the facts, and noV
from a feeling of resentment arising from
sometbing that bas been said hy some extramist in another part of the country. Furthermore, the demand mnust noV corne from a desire
Vo force conscription upon anybody. If you
tbink that someone in your town or province,
or even in another province, is noV doing bis
duty, that is a good reason for resentment;
but it is not a sound reason for dernending
conscription unless you can see that thereby
our war effort will ha hetter served.
In approaching this question of how far
Vbere is a present nouiessity for conscription, I
may say that the statement is rnade-and, at
first blush there is logic in it-that the fact
that the Governrnent called the plebiscite last
winter was of itself an admission by the Govarnimant thet there was an immediete necessity for conscription. Ahl you have Vo do Vo
sec t-hat that is noVt so is Vo read the speech
of the Prime Minister. The plebisicite was
called in anticipation of what threetened and
wbat migbt happen. Those who were on the
platforma and at the radio urging conscription
allowed themselves, I think, Vo dwell very
strongly on the necessity. They were seeking
to persuade the voters Vo vote '"Yes." The
people responded Vo tbet appeal, and in the
44587-21J

3M~

resuit, I think, because of the sort of appeal
that was made, rnany people feit a kind of
let-down when sornething did not happen immediately. They experienced an anti-climax,
not necessarily because it was justified, but
hecause of the incidents that had developed.
Let us look at this question. I followed
with great interest and much respect the
figures given by the honourable senator front
Vancouver (Hon. Mr. McRae) this afternoon.
But 1 arn sure hie rnust agree with me that
in the lest analysis bie is speculating somewhat
on this question. It was witb difficulty that

anything about conscription with respect Vothern. I was quoting the Minister of National
Defence.

Hon. Mr. FATIRIS: My honourable friend'

My staternent witb regard to these men is:
that whether tbey go as volunteers or as
conscripts tbe prohlemn is the sanie. It is a
mighty dificuit tbing to get themn over there.
Hon. Mr. McRAE: Agreed.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: Now, honourable senators, it seems to me there is one tbing overlooked by ail the~ critics who say that conscription is flot being brought into effect soorr
enougb. Sufficient consideration is not being
given to the fact that we have conscription
in Canada to-day.
One of Mr. Cardin'&
complaints was that this Bill will make, conscription for overseas retroactive. Just think
What is
about that, honourable senators.
meant by retroactive conscription?
It does
flot mean that advantage is being taken of
any man who has volunteered. The complaint
is with respect Vo men who have been drafted
for training. And when that complaint is
analy,5ed what do we find? We find that
when the Government does declare for conscription, for overseas service the m.en takei
will be more or less trained instead of
being absolutely raw recruits. Let ine read&
what the Prime Minister said the other night:.
Suppose we had conscription for service overseas in force et this hour. 1 think I arn right
when I say that not an additional man would
be called out, flot one more man would be
recaiving training et the present tirne, not one
man more would be sent overseas at the present
time, for the simple reason that we have more
men ready to go overseas to-day than it would
have been necessary to Taise by conscription
to meet the situation at the present time.
If the supply of volunteers fails there wilI be.no question of starting a new system.

324

SENATE

I pause there to ask honourable members to
note how much more advantageous the
present situation is than that which confronted
Sir Robert Borden in 1917.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: May I ask the
honourable senator one question? I suppose
lie recognizes, as I do, that the voluntary
system has failed now?
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: No.
How can I
recognize it? How can any man recognize it
until he knows the facts? And we have that
statement from the Prime Minister, which so
far as I know lias net been challenged on
authoritative grounds. May I continue with
the Prime Mini-tor's statement?
If the supply of volunteers fails tliere will
be no question of starting a new system; all
that will be required will be to extend the scope
of service of men already called up and trained.
That is the answer to the question as to the
effect of delay in putting this systeni into force.
My honourable friend the leader opposite
(Hon. Mr. Ballantyne) said you could not
have an army composed half of draftees and
half of volunteers. That is not an accurate
report of his statement, but I think it contains the substance. I say to my honourable
friend that tiere is nothing to stop training
ien, half of whom are draftees and half
voliunteers, and if after they Iad been
trained it became necessary to pass an Order
in Council under the authority of this Bill,
there would be nothing to prevent conversion
of those draftees into men ready and available for overseas service.
Hon. Mr. MeRAE: Will my honourable
friend allow me a question? As I listened
to the speech of Hon. Mr. Cardin, I understood his objection to be this, that trainees
or draftees, whatever you may call them, were
signed up for home service, and it did net
seem te be fair to pass an Order in Council
making them subject te overseas service. At
least, if Mr. Cardin did not make that objec'tion, others did. They did net think it was
fair te treat in that way men who had been
.drafted for home service.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: My honourable friend
is perfectly right. But, with all deference te
him, may I say his question is side-tracking
the issue I am now discussing. I already
discussed the fairness or unfairness of the
complaint when I said that the measure was
not retroactive in the sense of taking advantage of a man who had volunteered. You do
not take advantage of a drafted man if you
change his duties. That is the answer te
Mr. Cardin's objection. Some honourable
senators may net agree with me, but to my
mind it is a logical answer. If you said te a
Hon .Mr. FARRIS.

man who had volunteered for home service,
"We asked you te volunteer for home service,
but now that we have got yeu we intend to
send you oxerseas," that would be taking an
unfair retroactive action. But there would be
nothing unfair

in, saying

to

a draftee, "We

-alled vou into the armîy without consulting
you as to whether or not you wished te
become a soldier, and now we have decided
it is necessary to send yeu overseas" Legislation uînder the Order in Couneil could be
said to be retroactive in that it applied to
trained draftees rather than raw recruits.
That leads ba'ck to the reply I was making
to the honourable leader opposite (Hon. Mr.
Ballantyne). As far as a group of men standing before the sergeant-major are concerned,
they will take their training just the same
whether tbey are told their ultimate destination is the Yukon or Great Britain.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE:

May I put in

one word there?

Hon. Mr. FARRIS: Certainly.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: When half the
men are to go overseas and the other half
are not, there will net be the sane esprit de
corps as if they all were training for overseas.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: I <lo not know. I think
it would be very unwise for my honourable
friend, in advocating conscription, to talk
about esprit <le corps, because if conscription
affects esprit de corps, ny honourable friend
must want the effect to be one hindred per
cent.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: No.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: Conscription either
affects or it does net affect esprit de corps.
My impression is that if men have the proper
appreciation of their citizenship, as I think
they have in Canada. there will be a good
esprit de corps whether they are selected under
the voluntary system or under the other. But
I say to my honourable friend that if there is
anything in his argument it is an answer to
bis own contention.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: Oh, no. I do
net like to interrupt umy honourable friend so
often.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: I do not mind.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: He does net get
my point. I know that undue coercion is
applied by men who have volunteered for
overseas against men who have not, and
there is a certain amount of strain or illfeeling between the two groups. That is the
point I was endeavouring te make.

JULY 28, 1942
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: That may or may not
be so. It must depend a great deal on the
commanding officer.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE:
true.

I know it is

Hon. Mr. FARRIS: I have been told of
officers who have entirely succeeded in correcting a situation of that kind. I do not
think it is a thing of real substance on which
we should spend much time. It seems to me
we had better get a little closer to the
essentials.
Now, honourable senators, I do not know
whether I have made mysîf clear or not. May
I just briefly review the situation as I see it?
First, it is my belief that conscription is sound
in principle. Let me illustrate it in this way.
I believe in prohibition, although I may not
practise it. And although a majority of the
people of Canada may honestly believe in
prohibition as a principle, they found that
principle and praictice do not always work
out the same. Now, having found conscription to be sound in principle, what is the next
step? I say the next step. is to consider the
principle in the light of our past, present
and future conditions. And I say further that
in taking that step the authorities shouild look
at it as a practical matter in relation to the
unity of Canada. And in doing so they should
not overlook this fact: that unity requires
not only that minorities in this country be
satisfied, but that the majority also be satisfied, in order that there may not be brought
about in Canada what I have termed an
emotional necessity. And when we have gone
thus far, I say the next logical step, in considering the criticism of possible future delay,
is to recognize the policy of the Government
and the situation as it exists to-day, with the
form of conscription we now have, which is
accepted by everybody, and to keep these
matters in mind when dealing with proposals
for the future.
Honourable senators, I want to say a word
on another aspect of this case that seems to
me mighty important. That is the relation
of Parliament and the people to our Prime
Minister. After all, he is our Prime Minister,
and he is the leader, not of the Liberal party
alone, but of the people of Canada. It bas
been said against him-not in this House, but
eleswhere-that he is more concerned with
the unity of the Liberal party than with the
unity of the country. I am referring to these
things because they are vitally related to
what we are now considering. It bas been
repeatedly ýcharged against him that bis
methods are devious. Even my honourable
friend from Ottawa East (Hon. Mr. Coté),

325

in bis moderately tempered speech, mentioned
the allegation of political adroitness, and
recalled, seemingly with approval, a statement in the "Time" magazine about the Prime
Minister having looped the loop three times.
The sum total of the attacks on and criticisms
of the Prime Minister of Canada seems to
be the charge that he is putting party and
opportunism above country. I say that if
charges of this kind carried to their logical
conclusion are proved, not only should
Mackenzie King not be Prime Minister today, but he should never have been regarded
as fit to occupy that position. I for one am
here to say that I believe those charges are
not true, and though I sometimes.disagree with
Mackenzie King, yet when I look at bis record
in perspective I am proud to be a supporter
of bis.
Some Hon. SENATORS:

Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. FARRIS: This is a time when
our country is in such deadly peril, and all
human ambitions are so trifling, that no
patriotic citizen should give such charges
even passing thought. The Prime Minister
of Canada bas led us in this war for three
years, and I submit he does not merit the
attacks made against him. I have been out
in the West and I am conscious of them.
They are repeated to me by close friends of
mine, who express themselves very strongly.
It disturbs me greatly. I cannot help, bonourable senators, going back again for a
moment to Laurier in the last war, to refer
to some things that were said about him. I
am reading from Skelton's book at page 537:
But there were other motives not so commendable concerned: the racial hatred against
Quebec, the arrogant assumption of exclusive
patriotism; the twisting and suppression of
Laurier's statenients; the weak swirming with
the tide of prejudice. The Toronto "News"
criticizing Laurier as "a demagogue, a charlatan
and a mountebank," a Montreal Scotch-Canadian declaration that "if Laurier were to win he
would win leading the cockroaches of the kitchen
of Canada to vietory," advertisements of a
Toronto Citizens' Union Committee appealing
for "a solid Ontario to prevent the domination
of a solid Quebec," asserting that "a Laurier
victory will be the first Canadian defeat," that
"Laurier is the tool of Bourassa," that "our
Victory Loan must not be handed over to
Quebec to spend," the posters declaring that
"a vote for Laurier is a vote for the Kaiser."
Honourable senators, I was in Ottawa the
week Union Government was formed-and I
was not looking for a position in that
Government either.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: I was at that time
Attorney-General of British Columbia, and
was attending sittings of the Supreme Court.

SENATE

326

In company with the present leader of this
House (Hon. Mr. King), I had the great
privilege of calling on Sir Wilfrid Laurier.
He was not well. He was suffering what a
man of his sensitive nature must have suffered
that week, for some of bis oldest and most
tried friends found it necessary to disagree
with him. But he had a poise, a peace of
soul, that I did not observe in any other man
in Ottawa. He never suggested to us that he
could win this election; but that did net
disturb him. His message te us at that time
was this: "My life work bas been to preserve
the unity of Canada, and I do net intend
to sacrifice that for any present political
advantage. It is my belief that if I took
any other course than I am taking I should
be surrendering my province into the hands
of extremists."
That interview bad much to do with my
course in that election, and I was proud to
be a supporter of Sir Wilfrid Laurier. Looking back over the years that intervene, I am
prouder to-day than I was in 1917.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: I mentioned that I
had in my notes a reminder to quote some
of the tbings that Sir Robert Borden in his
book says about Laurier and the honesty of
I commend Sir Robert's
his convictions.
Memoirs te honourable senators, particularly
pages 726 and 727. but probably most of you
have already read his work.
I mention these things now, not to stir up
rancour. Oh, no. On the contrary, I do so in
the hope that as we look back over those
twenty-five years we may, no matter how
close we are to that period, get a little better
I believe that
perspective of the present.
when this war is over and the record of
Mackenzie Ring is seen in its true proportions
over the years, he will rank with Laurier
and Borden as one of Canada's greatest
statesmien.
If there is one contribution I should wish to
make at this time it would-be to help restore
confidence in the public mind. That confidence bas been, greatly disturbed. I believe
that Mackenzie King is leading Canada witb
vision and courage. Look at his conscription
record, his war record in that connection, in
perspective, if it is possible for us to do so at
this time. As I have already said, be led
Canada into this war a united people. I
still have a great admiration for Right Hon.
Mr. Meighen, though he used to stimulate
my opposition and very often I found I could
not agree with him. I heard him suggest,
standing where my honourable friend the
present leader (Hon. Mr. Ballantyne) is
to-night,-this happened three years ago, but
Hon.

Mr. FARRIS.

I think I can recall it with fair accuracythat if Mackenzie King had only taken a
stand before Germany moved against Czechoslovakia, it might have stayed Hitler's hand.
Honourable senators, suppose he had done
what the then leader opposite suggested, and
Mayor Houde had made the statements that
he did make after we entered the war. There
was no restrictive wartime law in force in
Suppose that Mr.
Canada at that time.
Coldwell, leader of the C.C.F., bad, because
of some militant statement by the Prime
Minister, been prompted to declare what he
did declare after the war started-and I
quoted it to-night. I wonder how much those
protests would have helped to stay the hand
No, honourable members, the
of Hitler.
Prime Minister of Canada, with pressure on
him before the war started, kept his head and
guided the Ship of State safely into port. We
were a united country entering the war, and
his stand on conscription was a contribution
to the unanimous position then taken. We
all know that.
Now, there was notbing devious about that.
It was a simple and direct action in the light
of three years' perspective. Then we had an
election. Of course, again be was charged with
devious political action. But the trouble was
net its deviousness; it was direct action, a
direct appeal to the people. If he had not
taken that action, honourable senators, what
would have been the situation? Either we
should have bad an election later, when war
conditions were much worse, or we should
to-day have a moribund House of Commons,
in no way whatever representative of the
people of Canada.
Somne Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: After that election we
had the Mobilization Act, section 3 of which
it is sougbt to repeal by this Bill. Does any
honourable senator contend there was anything
devious in that action? Why, the Act was
passed by a unanimous Parliament. Then
Oh! what allegations
came the plebiscite.
were made about the machinations of the
subtle mind whon that question was submitted
to the country! Yet what do we find? He
had one of three positions to take. First, te
continue as be was. The majority opinion
in Canada to-day would not say that be should
have so continued regardless of future possibilities. The next alternative was another
election; whicb was unthinkable. The other
alternative would have been to throw his
promise to the winds and bring in conscription
without consulting the people. I might ask
honourable senators te go back again to history, but you do net need to do that. Turn

JULY 28, 1942
rather to the present. Do you think that if
the Prime Minister of Canada had, taken that
course you would have had the temperate
speech from 'Mr. Cardin which we heard in
the House of Commons last week, and from
which I have read to you? It may be that he
would have broken up his party. It may be
that if he had ambitions only for leadership
he could have headed a Union Government
which would have said, "We will defy Quebec."
And undoubtedly he could have got a majority vote. But no man with the vision I
believe the Prime Minister has, and with the
sense of patriotism which I think we ought to
give him credit for, as we give it to ourselves,
could ever wish anything so disastrous to
Canada as that kind of racial cleavage would
bave been. So I say that even in short perspective the alleged deviousness disappears.
Then we have Bill 80, which, as I have
already said, is the logical sequence of the
plebiscite.
Lastly we 'have the future to look to. There
is nothing I need say about that. I have
already pointed out how men are being trained.
Do you think the Prime Minister is concerned with party advantage in that? Really,
honourable senators, what has the future to
offer a man in Mackenzie King's position at
bis age, except the laudable ambition which
ought to be any man's, that when his life's
history is written it will be declared of him
that he did his duty by his country as he saw
bis duty. No other tribute would be worth
seeking.
Again, I think of Laurier as he spoke to my
honourable friend from Kootenay East (Hon.
Mr. King) and myself. His life work was the
unity of Canada and the British connection.
But Mackenzie King has entered on a wider
field. He has a scope of responsibilities
greater than any in Laurier's time. He has,
as Laurier had in bis day, Canadian unity to
think of and to achieve. He has had a vision
of unity with Britain, as Laurier had-and in
that we are behind him. He had a vision of
neighbourly unity with the United States of
America at a time when that neigh;bourly unity
was the most vital necessity in the life of our
Empire.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: He had a vision of a
new unity-and he has it to-day-a unity
between Britain and the United States of
Anerica.
Then, honourable senators, in his position
as Prime Minister of this country he has had
a vision of unity in Canada in regard to
material things, such as production based on
the co-operation of capital and labour and the

327

consumer. He bas had a vision of the unity of
our forces in the air, on the land and on the
sea.
Honourable senators, I shall not take time
to analyse that group of unities in detail. I
have already spoken about them so far as
Canada is concerned. But let me group the
unity of Canada with Britain and with the
United States, and the unity of Britain with
the United States, and recall to your minds that
before this war started there were laid by the
present Prime Minister some foundations
which, I think, are more vital to our present
welfare than the question of just how the next
hundred thousand men are to be secured in
Canada.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: I go back to the month
of August in the year 1938. There was an
opening of the Thousand Islands bridge, and
Franklin Roosevelt made his famous declaration on unity and a revived Monroe Doctrine.
Mackenzie King responded. I do not say
that Mackenzie King is entirely responsible
for what happened, but I do say that what
happened was in line with the vision of the
things that he was trying to achieve.
Then I go back-oh, with What pleasure lto the spring of 1939, when Their Majesties
were here. They travelled across Canada and
into the United States. Mackenzie King was
the Prime Minister on whose advice, under
our new constitution, that trip was taken; and
he, as the constitutional adviser, accompanied
Their Majesties on that trip. We know what
that did even for us in Canada, and what it
did in the United States. It was such
beginnings as these that led to things which
mean so much to Canada as time goes on.
Then there was the Ogdensburg Agreement
in August of 1940, when the Joint Defence
Council was provided for. Remember, the
United States was not yet in the war. And
there was the Hyde Park Agreement, when
Mackènzie King sat in the home of the
President of the United States, and the two
of them worked out their common problems
in regard to supplies in the two countries and
for Great Britain.
I ask honourable members to look at the
broadcast which Lord Beaverbrook made in
March of 1941, and which is to be found in
the London Free Press. His statement was
as follows:
The Aircr.aft Production Minister said close
collaboration between the United States and
Britain was the "crowning good" made possible
by the war.
"And how bas it come about?" he asked
answering: "Through the leadership of (Prime
Minister) Churchill, through the vision of the
Prasident (Roosevelt), through (the foresight of

SENATE

328

my own countryman, Mackenzie King. Prime
Minister of Canada, through the heroic resistance of the British people and through the
ware of comradeship and resistance they have
awakened in the American nation."
T have many more quotations that I might
recite te you to show what bas gone on. The
honourable senator from Wellington (Hon.
Mr. Howard) this afternoon detailed some
things in connection with our war production.
I ask honourable members when they go
home from this session te try to look at this
question of conscription, not as closely as we
have been following it last winter and spring
and this summer, but as only one of the
incidents in this great policy of unification
which is at the very basis of a really successful war effort.
Honourable senators, we are about to commit the responsibility arising from this legislation to Mackenzie King, but not to him alone.
We commit it to bis Government as a whole.
and in particular to the Ministers at the head
of the Army, the Navy and the Air Service.
These arc the Ministers who, along with the
Prime Minister, will have the immediate
responsibility of saying what men are needed
in our fighting forces, and they are conscious
of no obligation save the performance of the
trust which their fellow Canadians have
reposed in them. We know that our cause is
in good hands. It is in the hands of men who
are honest, capable and fearless. To them we
commit this Bill, confident that they will not
fail us, and that they will not fail the men in
the fighting services. When our task is donc
and tiis Bill is law, let us all forget our controversics, let us suppress our hysterics, and
let us renember the sentiment expressed the
other day by Churchill in the British House
of Comnions, that leaders do their best when
they know that they can rely on the loyalty
and support of those for whom they lead.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
PREVOST
EDOUARD
Hon.
JULES
(Translation): Honourable senators, I think
it is uny duty to say a few words before casting my vote on the Bill before this House.
With slight differences and sometimes with
aggravating
circunstances,
history
often
repeats itself.
From 1914 to 1918, along with our civil and
religious leaders, I was in favour of Canada's
participation in the war, but I was opposed
te military conscription for service overseas,
because I thought it was worthless, harmful,
unjustificd and unnecessary for national
defonce.
In the present war, since 1939, along with
our civil and religious leaders, I have been in
favour of Canada's participation in this conHon.

Mr. FARRIS.

flict, in which ber best interests are at stake,
but again I am opposed to conscription for
overseas service until such a step is proven to
be necessary to save Canada from defeat.
The Bill before us is not in itself a measure
of conscription.
It is intended to give the Government,
responsible to Parliament, the freedom to act
according to the needs of national interest.
I have been and I still am an anti-conscriptionist. I shall remain so until I am convinced that compulsion is necessary to save
Canada from defeat, to safeguard ber most
preciuis liberties and ber very existence as a
free and Christian nation.
For the present, voluntary enlistments are
more than adequate according to the Minister
The Prime
of National Defence himself.
Minister bas often made the statement, which
he repeated only a few days ago in the House
of Commons, that conscription is not now and
may never become necessary. Is it likely that
it will become necessary?
Since 1939 and 1940 conditions have changed
grsatly. The dangers which threaten us have
increased and daily become more formidable;
the upheaval is universal; Germany and Japan
are engaged in securing universal domination.
Should the United Nations be defeated, Canada
would become the prey of the Germans and
of the Japanese.
In such terrible circumstances., if Mr.
Mackenzie King asks that Parliament and his
Gover.nment be released from certain promises
made in 1940 and before, it does net mean
that he is neglecting the defence of his country first and always.
Wien he asks to be given a free hand like
the other political leaders of the United
Nations, so as to be guided solely by the
nocessities which may arise and by the vital
interests of the nation, and when he promises
to submit his decisions to the approval of
Parliament, it would be an insuit to sav that
he is not aware of Canada's needs or that he
does not understand the necessity of providing
for the defence of Canadian territory.
I have not yet met a red-blooded Canadian
who is opposed to conscription for the defence

of Canada on Canadian soi.
never met a well-informed Canadian opposed
to cons-ription even for overseas service
if it should be really needed to win the war.
Conscription is a ticklish matter. Such a
means of raising troops bas become for the
Imperialists an objective which must be
realized at once, whether necessary or not.
Conscription so madly insisted upon is the
death-rattle of Imperialism in Canada.
For some, conscription is a disturbing and
It awakens in them the

JULY 28, 1942
memory of the nightmare of 1917, when conscription was resorted to without reason, and
unnecessarily, and was brutally imposed. It
was then a great mistake. Hon. Mr. Manion,
who was in favour of conscription in 1917,
admitted in the House of Commons, after
becoming leader of his party in 1939, that the
conscription measure of 1917 had been a
mistake.
I cannot admit that the principle of conscription, involved in the present Bill, is
something new. The principle of the levée en
masse for the defence of Canada, inside or
outside of Canada, is to be found in the
Militia Act (section 77), which was passed
in Cartier's time.
Section 3 of the Mobilization Act of 1940
suspended the application of that principle.
By removing that suspension, the amendment
before us enacts no new principle. It simply
changes the Act to comply with the plebiscite
vote that released the Government from its
commitments of 1939 and 1940. Through the
present Bill the Government is asking only
for the same powers that were granted te it
by the plebiscite. I had confidence in the
Government and I voted "Yes" on the plebiscite. I see no reason why I should' withdraw
my confidence and refuse to-day what I
accepted yesterday. The Prime Minister of
Canada asks for full power to govern in the
interests of the nation, just as Churchill in
Great Britain and Roosevelt in the United
States have done. The future actions of the
Government, which may result from this Act,
will have to be assented to by Parliament.
The members of the House of Commons and
of the Senate give their assent by casting a
vote. I reserve the right te give or te refuse
my assent according to the use which the
Government intends to make of the freedom
of action it desires and I am ready te grant.
It is said that we should' not give such
powers to the Government because Mackenzie
King is net eternal and another Government
might abuse them and enact a different policy.
It matters little what the legislation of yesterday and of to-day may enact if another Government should succeed to the present Government. It would be free to act and amend
that legislation, provided it had the support
of Parliament and of the people. Laws are
made by governments, but the governments
are made by the people.
What will happen to-morrow? God alone
knows. But we know that Canada is at war,
and we want to win that war. In accordance
with the noblest Canadian and French Canadian traditions, I am ready for all sacrifices in
order that Canada may escape defeat. God

329

knows the sadness that assails my heart when
I speak these words as father of a family.
But the Motherland is entitled to our best.
In these tragic days, I think, I am making
no mistake in placing my confidence in the
present leader of the Government, Mackenzie
King, whom I recognize as a safe, sincere,
courageous, clear-sighted, and loyal guide,
and whose Canadianism has often been tested
and found true.
Hon. EUGENE PAQUET (Translation):
Honourable senators, ever since Canada declared war on Germany I have refrained from
taking part in the discussion and I have tried
to help the Government in every way to secure
victory. Canada has entered this war of her
own free will for the defence of her liberty, of
democracy and civilization. Never before bas
humanity witnessed such a duel between the
barbarism of the attackers and the heroism of
her defenders.
We fight at the side of Great Britain and the
United States to repel the invaders and to
ensure the triumph of democratic ideals. At
the beginning of the war our political leaders
declared that Canada's participation was abso"Voluntary participation,
lutely voluntary.
voluntary enlistments, conscription only for
the defence of Canadian territory."
These are the words that were heard all
over Canada. Came the call to arms and the
most authoritative voices among the clergy,
the Press, and the political associations of
the country were united for the defence of
the Allied cause against an enemy who believes
in force only, who shamelessly makes light of
his atrocities, who tramples on the most
sacred promises, who pitilessly kills children,
women and the aged, who violates the principles of humanity, flouts international law
and bas no respect for the pledged word.
Odious doctrines have perverted the moral
sense of the German race. After Canada's
sublime sacrifices it would be unjust to conscript her sons by violent methods and to
In
collect the blood tax by compulsion.
accelerating farm desertion through compulsory recruitment we should be guilty of an
error which would react on our economie life.
I have always thought that Canada must
defend her soil and her freedom. From the
very beginning of this war the soil of our
country and the freedom of our people have
been threatened.
Germany could net find a more fertile
land to feed her immense population, to
expand her trade and her barbarous domination. In presence of the danger America is
awakening. The distances which divide the
New World from the Old no longer guarantee

our security. With the advent of modern
progress, the seas have become narrower and
airplanes wing their way across the ocean.
From the first hours of the war Canada has
seen the danger signal and her sons have
rushed across the seas, to the first line of
defence. Now that German barbarism is
unleashed in all its fury, we know that we
are fighting for what we hold most sacred.
We know that we are not fighting for England
only, but are fighting at her side, for Canada,
our country, for the safeguard of our freedom,
for the free exercise of our religion, for the
right to speak and to think in French, for
our own way of living in our own country,
which is our Motherland.
I think that the Bill before the House is
an unfortunate legislative measure, because
it might destroy national unity, which is
essential if we wish to be victorious. I have
faith in the results of the voluntary system.
I am convinced that it will answer our needs,
provided recruiting is well directed and supported by the people of goodwill.
We have entered this war voluntarily and we
want to continue voluntarily. The ministers
have bee n telling us over and over again that
the voluntary system was adequate. Have all
necessary efforts been made to ensure its
success? Or bas the voluntary system suddenly failed? Have not certain Imperialist
quarters tried to impede its functioning? Have
they not been purposely negligent in recruiting
so as to force the Government to apply the
final remedy? It bas been said: "Raise the
dependents' allowances and the number of
commissions; make the voluntary system
attractive and it will be adequate. Why not
spend a few millions more in the form of
allowances if we can maintain the voluntary
systen, which is the corner-stone of national
unity and of our war effort?"
Conscriptionists
uindoubte dly
wish
our
country to make the greatest war effort possible. I an protesting, not against Canada's
war effort. but against a political doctrine
which I repudiate to-day as I did in 1917.
Conscription for overseas service is repugnant to the people of Quebec. I am willing
that we should contribute money, food-stuffs,
munitions, volunteers for the triumph of Canada, of Great Britain and of the Allies.
In this grave hour, I believe I am serving
Canada most sincerely in refusing to vote for
a law which might divide the country and
destroy national unity.
The Canadian Government asks us to
increase our war effort. They want more
Hon. Mr. PAQUET.

planes, more ships, more munitions, more men.
How can that objective be attained if our
factories are emptied of the men who could
achieve the greatest production?
"Give us the tools," said Churchill.
We
have made a greater effort than was expected
of us.
Voluntary enlistments for overseas
must have reached the 500,000 mark by now.
After the declaration of war in September,
1939, Hon. Mr. Lapointe, wishing to prevent
disunity, suggested a compromise agreement,
which was accep'ted by the province of Quebec:
"Participation without conscription." Under
its terms, accepted by Parliament and ratified at the general election of March, 1940,
I supported Hon. Mr. Lapointe's policy, by
which the Government, Parliament and all
political parties were bound. Mr. Lapointe
had clearly specified,: "Never will the province of Quebec accept conscription for service
outside of Canada."
The Mobilization Act of 1940, which enforced conscription for home defence only,
is now to become a conscription measure for
service in any theatre of war. This amendment to the Mobilization Act of 1940 is a
violation of the agreement reached in September, 1939.
In this gigantie struggle the province of
Quebec has refused to free the Government
from its anti-conscription pledges; categorically so. The Government remains bound' by
its word. Yet once section 3 of the Act is
stricken out, our Statute Book will contain a
conscription law for overseas service. We
shall then be forced to fight outside of Canada.
Now I say it is impossible to change in a
few weeks' time a state of mind fostered in a
people for three centuries.
As a physician of fifty years' experience
and a representative of the people, I believe
I know sonething about the population of
our province. Though they are ready for any
sacrifice in order to win the war, they detest
coercion and will never willingly accept such
a measure.
The winning of the war must be our main
preoccupation, for defeat would have the
most tragic consequences for Canada as well
as the whole British Empire. The survival
of our democratic institutions demands that
we prepare our defence in the most efficient
manner possible. The enemy spares no effort
to maintain his fighting strength at the highest pitch. If the democracies are to survive,
we must prepare for even heavier sacrifices.
Instead of discouraging us, the critical and
painful hours through which we are now
living should make us ponder the situation
and impel us to react energetically.

JULY 28, 1942
The Action Catbolique of Marcb 6, 1942,
contained an editorial wbich ran in part as
foilows:
Is it worth endangering the success of the
present voluntary enlistment system. throughout

the country, the excellent understanding wbich
exists in the Army, the enthusiasm in our war
plants, peace on our f arms, wbich are expected
to yield more and more produce, and the
defence of our territory, for which. we bave
less than a haif million men lef t, merely in
order to gratify the whim of a conscriptionist
minority? We do nlot think so.
In tbis struggle to the deatb in defence of
bigh principles our first duty is to put everytbing we have into the pursuit of our war
effort.
The present confliet demands beavy sacrifices of us, and the French Canadians are
contributing magnificently to our war effort.
Wýe are nGw weatbering the foul fury of the
stormi, and tbe enemy is extremely powerful.
Wbile defending tbeir rigbts, the iFrencb
Canadians bave always striven for unity in
Canada. In tbeir opinion, tbe maintenance
of the voluntary system is an, essential factor
in the preservation of tbat unity. As in 1917,
conscription would engender iil-feeling more
than it would raise men for tbe Army. It
would weaken our defence both in Canada and
overseas.
As the Prime Minister of Canada bas said,
"The tragie fate of Francýe hequeatbs to Frencb
Canada the duty of bearing bigh tbe Frencb
traditions of culture and civilization, and bier
burning 1,ove of freedom."
This duty we intend to fuil with ail tbe
andour of our Frencb souls. The confiiet in
wbich we are taking part d'emands beavy
sacrifices of us, and the French Canadians
are contributing magnificently to the war
effort. We are now weatbering tbe full fury
of the storm and the enemy is extrem-ely
powerfui. Our very existence perbaps is at
stake, and the Frencb Canadian people in this
emergency stop forth unanimousiy ta do tbeir
share.
I am proud to heiong to a race that bas
written tbe most giorious pages of Canadian
bistory by its loyaity, its strengtb of purpose
and ils indomnitable courage. With a superb
sense of ioyalty and devotion, the overseas
Dominions bave vied with one another as

the victory of Canada and hier Allies, as well
as the unity and prosperity of the Canadian
people.
The Bill now under consideration establishes the principle of compulsory service
enforced by Order in Council whenever it is
d.eemed necessary.
The French Canadians are willing to do
their part in the war effort, and, despite the
insinuations of certain conscriptionists, we
are as desirous of victory as any other
province.
Canada is more deeply divided on this
issue than it has ever been, and we believe
that conscription will bring disunity with al
its fateful consequences. Moreover, neither
the need nor the efficiency of compulsory
service bas ever been demonstrated. Notbing
in the political bistory of Canada since Coufedieration has caused more bitterness and
resentment, or bas contributed, more to
setting one race against the other in this
country. Is it necessary to rcpcat our unfortunate experiences of the past? To-day we
are united. Let us therefore endeavour to>
preserve this unity, instead of sowing the
germi of disunity in the soul of a war effort
of whicb Canada bas every reason to be
proud.
Consid«r the case of the other Dominions.
Neither Australia nor South Africa nor
Nortbern Ireland bas conscription. These
countries 'bave ail rejected such a measure,
yet no one charges tbem with treason or
cowardice, an insuit speciaily reserved for
the French Canadians in Quebec. We are
readýy to defend tbis country. We are also
ready to assist in the war being waged overseas, but it must be of our own free will,
hecause tbe Government bas toid us time
and again tbat our war effort was to be
voiuntary as regards the sending of men
overseas.
Tbrougbout our bhistory tbe Frencb Canadians bave always voluntariiy responded to
tbe appeýais made to tbem. And since tbe
voluntary systemn is adequate for our needs,
wby cast it overboard and widen the guif
that divides our two races?
The bistoricai events of 1776 and 1812, of
1914 and 1939, clearly illustrate that the French
Canadians have aiways voluntarily responded
to the Mo>ther Country's appeal. Tbey intend
ta develop French civilization in Amerîca.
"Wben evil men unite, good men must band

Tbese nations naw occupying the posts of

sacrifice. They intend, as Pitt once saidý, to
save themselves by their labours, and to save
the world by their example.
What would
Canada's future be like in a German-dominated world? Why bas Canada entered this
conflict? Because Canada is a part of the
British Empire and the Empire is under attack. There can be in Canada but one aim
and one spirit. Canadians are proud of the
Mother Country, proud to see that she has
entered this war, net with aims of territorial
aggrandizement, but simply to defend ber
honour, fulfil ber obligations to her Allies,
keep ber pledged word and save civilization
from an adversary mad with the desire for
,conquest and domination.
The defeat of
democracy would unloose upon us a wave of
destruction and slavery which would engulf
and destroy the traditions, rights and privileges
acquired by our forefathers at the price of their
lives. Does such a picture not strike terror
into our hearts?
Let us never forget that
Canada, by the size of ber habitable areas,
the obundýance of ber natural resources and
the excellence of ber economie equipment,
would be a rich prize for a victorious enemy.
For an over-populated country what better
demographic estuary could be found, and for
an enemy who dreams of domination by the
force of arms what stronger bastion in North
America? In the final settlement of accounts,
the former German colonies in Africa would
soon be overlooked in faveur of a young
country with a temperate climate, where the
victor would find the essential raw materials
he needs te operate his industries. If we
consider the terrifying prospect of enemy conquest, we cannot fail to realize that we must
sacrifice everything for an Allied victory. It
must be a very powerful reason that brings
the people of the United Kingdom, Poland,
France, South Africa, Australia, New Zealand
and Canada to fight side by side in this war.
No other empire or country in history has
ever shown such determination.
Why are
these peoples of different races, religions, and
climates ready to lay clown their lives to defeat
the enemy?
Because they live under the
British flag, whicl flies at this very moment
above our heads, and bocause they know that
wberever the British flag flies, every citizen's
freedom is safeguarded, his life and property
are secure. In its folds we find freedom of
thought and speech, freedom of the Press and
of religion, and lastly the greatest measure of
freedom consistent with the security of the
State, based on the eternal principles of tolerance and justice. This war is for our very
survival.
The forces of aggression have united together and those of freedom must do the same

Mr. PAQUET.

if they wish to survive. The very existence of
world freedom is at stake and there can be no
compromise with an enemy who bas decided to
dominate the world by force. More than ever
do we understand that the world cannot continue to live in a state of half-freedom and
half-slavery.
In 1917 I opposed conscription for service
overseas. In 1939, an agreement was reached
by the two main Canadian elements: the
conseriptionist and the anti-conscriptionist.
On March 26, 1940, this agreement was ratified by both groups for the duration of the
war.
Canada entered this war of ber own free
will, because she believed ber vital interests
were seriously threatened. The conflict in
which our country is engaged has become so
widespread that we cannot hope to secure
victory save at the price of the heaviest sacrifices. The pursuit of this war requires constant and ever-increasing efforts on the part
of our citizens.
For us Canadians. these efforts must be
dcvoted to the establishrnt and miaintenance of an Armuy, an Air Force and a Navy

of suffiient strength to defend our territory
and help our Allies. Our countrv can play
a vital part in this conflict by continuing to
supplyc n through the voluntary enlistment
systeu. Wc ail know the grave disunity which
resulted frou the enforcement of conscription
during the last war. Ceercion wa odmittedly
the wrong mcthod to choose, and absolutely
useles:, both as rc gaids the furthering of the
w-or effort and the developm ent of our national
life.
I bhxve alwovs opposed conscription for
oveorseasservice and I shall continue to do se,
becaue t he reasons that motivated such a
tond ou n' part in the past still exist. This
is an unfai
and useless measure. bound to
prove

as disastrous in

the future

as it

was

in the past. It is useless to want te force upon
the people an effort so great that they will
ie unable to sustain it if the war lasts a few

years longer.
For us Frcnch Canadians Canada is the only
\,othber(Countrv, our truc and sole Motherland. It is here that we wish to live as our
forefathers have done before us. Russian soldiers are fighting for Russia, the English for
Englonid, the Americans for the United States,
and in the province of Quebec our fellowcitizens will fight only for Canada. In the
lefence of Canada, you will find none more
devoted, more eager and more enthusiastic in
this land than the people of the province of

Quebec.

JULY 28, 1942
Hon. L. M. GOUIN: Honourable senators,
on the great question which we are now
discussing it is very clearly the duty of every
one of us to ýadopt, consciously, the attitude
inspired by the patriotismn which is in him.
I say this even though it may inspire in others
a course absolutely opposed to my own.
May I remark that although I have participated in almost every election in. the province
of Quebec for the past twenty-five years, I
have neyer made any promise concerning
conscription. I think it would be a grave
error te exaggerate the importent part played
by that question, during the electoral campaigns
in1 my province. In any event, I was not
bound by any pledge; and during the camapaign on the plebiscite I feit perfectly free
to speak, as I did several times, urging My
fellow-rniintrymen to answer affirmatively.
The vast majority of the population to which
I have the honour to belong did not li.sten to,
my voice; they re.jected the views which I
had already expressed in this Huse on
January 27 last, when speaking on the Address
in Repiy to, the Speech from the Throne.
On that occasion I stated very clearly my
opinion that our Government should be given
authority to enforce military service outside
of Canada, if it deems that necessary. For
this statement I was severely criticized during
the plebiscite campaigo, by some in my own
province who were then organizing the "ýNo"
vote.
Such personal attacks, or any attaek on our
party or our race, or even an aur religious convictions, should not distract our attention
from the real menit of the very serions question which we are now eonsidering.
Here
we are, nil in perfect agreement that we want
te win ,this war. But when we ask ourselves

how we want te win this war we realize that
we have among us the same divisions which
are te be found in the country. We are
divided when it cames ta adopting the hest
meýans of achieving victery and of thus
securing a peace honourable for us and just
for ail.

We are terribly divided on this conscription
issue. Our Canadian demaeracy is now undergoing the most severe test in aur national
history. Our enemies are literally at aur
gates an the Pacific, as well as on aur Eastern
coast. At this grave heur of peril aur internal
unity is lest because of the present crisis.
Despite the verdict of April 27 last, a very
large majority of my people look on the
present amendment with great disfavour and
much dissatisf action. Yet Quebec is perfectly loyal. On this point I wish to corroborate ail the 'hanourable senatori fram. my
province who have spoken before -me. Yes,
Quebec is as eager as any other province te

333

win this war, and Quebec fully realizes what
would be the consequence of defeat upon the
preservation of our ideal of freedom, the
safeguarding of our most sacred traditions,
the faith and the culture which is dear te each
et us. But the majority of my race have hecorne convinced, and remain convinced, that.
the present Bill means virtually the putting.
inýto force of conscription for overseas, and in
their opinion there is ne necessity fer such a.
policy.

I cannot fail te take into account veryr
seriously the stand so clearly taken by thegreat mass of my own people, a stand which
was reflected by the vote of our representatives in another place. I have very seriously
considered ail those facts. I have weighed
very carefully ail the arguments which have
been preaented against the Bull before us.
First of ail, I believe that it is net accurate
te state that the purpose of Bill 80 is te'
impose the will of the majority upon the
dissenting minority. This amendment, in my
opinion, is the necessary and logical consequence of the result of the plebiscite. Is it
net true that the maI ority of the Canadian
people sheuld have absolute freedom of action
for the recruiting of our forces? Well, the
Bill purely and simply gives a free hand to
the Government in accordance with theverdict of the electors.
I trust that thediscretienary powers give'n te the Government, in which I have confidence, wiIl not ha,
abused. I still hope very sincerely that it
will net become necessary to impose ceercive
military service for everseas.
But, honourable senators, this is a lightningwar, a war of movement and of great surprises.
And every one of us has to ask himself very
seriously and earnestly: Is it net possible
that seener or later a day may unexpectedlycorne when cempulsory service eutside Canad'a
wil be necessary for the protection of our
country? The Gevernment states that such a
contingency may arise-and the Ministers;
have in their possession confidential information to which I have net access. It is true

that in a case of emergency the provisions of
the War Measures Act ceuld he inveked and,~

an Order in Ceuncil passed ta provide in anymanner for any expeditionary force requiredBut the Gevernment dees net want te apply-the War Measures Act te those who havaheen called under the Mobilization ActTherefore, the salvation of our country, victory
or defeat, might depend one day in the more
or less distant future upon the powers given
te the Government hy our Mobilizatien Act.
It is net with a light heart, but eut of a
sense of duty te my country and te My
fellow-country-men, t-hat I consider myaelf

SENATE
'obliged, before God and my conscience, to
allow the Government ta take any military
measures which may be required to assure
the defence of Canada. I arn confident that
~under the patriotie leadership of our Prime
~Minister the Ministers of the Crown will
fulfil conscientiously and in the best interest
of our nation the grave mission entrusted ta
them as representatives of all the Canadian
people.
This vital question, the most acute of aur
national problems, should be approached from
a hroad national point of view by alI of us.
I wish týo join in the cloquent plea made by
the honaurable senator from Wellington, (Hon.
Mr. Howard) for more co-operatian between
the two main elements in this country. To
the English-speaking mai ority I appeal for
a better understanding of the French Canadian. l ask the mai ority ta show to aur
minarity such a spirit af fair play, such a truly
Canadian patriatism, as ta make passible
again the fullcst degree af ca-aperatian and
that spiritual unanimity whieh must unite alI
classes, alI parties, all creeds and all races
for the success4u1 prasecutian of the mighty
and almast superhuman task naw ahead af

of Gad that wve can still avaid the warst
disasters and finally secure peace and victary.

Hon. ANT01NE J. LEGER:

Honourahie

senators, 1 do nat intend ta go over the
ground already cavered by honourable senators
who bave preceded me. Like some af these
hanourable members, I amn very critical of
the Bill now under consideration, for its proponents have nat satisfied me that the voluntary system of enlistment for overseas service
has failed, that the necessity for conscription
exists or that its adoption wauld pramote the
cause of the Allies. On the: contrary, it has
been stressed that the Allies' chief difficulty
arises from the lack af machines, nat the lack
"Give us the tools and we
of man-pawer.
will finish the job."
Should the necessity of conscription for
overseas serviîce, arise, a bill shauld be presented ta Parliarnent setting forth the several
principles of the Government's plan, so that

honourable members might know and appreciate the country's obligation. I arn not in
favour ai delegating ta any governrnent, however good and non-partisan it may profess ta
be, such authority as is proposed in this
measure, ta be later made use ai through
Order in Couneil.
There are those who claim that the plebiscite
bas settled the question. Well, I do not view
i-on. Mr. GOUIN.

In my humble opinion, to Say
that the "Yes" vote on the plebiscite was a
vote in favour of conscription is perhaps to
rnisread and misinterpret what was said and
printed in the advocacy of such a vote. Canadians were neyer asked whether or flot they
wanted conscription for overseas service. If
the intention was that conscription should be
imposed, or that a "Yes" vote wauld be a
vote in favour of conscription, the fair way
would have been to tell the electors so. But
the contrary idea, prevailed. The electors
were told that the suprernacy of Parliament
would be preserved and that the representatives of the people would be consulted before
any conscription policy was adopted.
If the propased Bill is meant as a consultation of Parliament, then, in my opinion, it
seems unfair to us, inasmuch as it gives no
details as to how, when and where conscription
is to be imposed. On the other band, if the
Bill is flot intended as a means of consulting
Parliament, then the pledge given to the
electors that the plebiscite was flot a vote on
conscription should be held as morally binding
as that pledge which the plebiscite sought to
g-et rid of.
I may say that the Acadians in many sections of my province voted "No" on the
iiIebiscite. Yet, althuugh wü rejresent but onethird of the population of the province, our
ratio of enlistments is between forty and fifty
per cent of the provincial total. The Acadians
voted "No" on the plebîscite because it was
not explicit enough. And I myseli criticize
this measure, not so much for what it says
as what it does not say. I arn not in favour
of making conscription possible by Order in
Council.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Laca.sse, the debate
was adjourned.

That he will caîl the attention of the Senate

I would not presurne at this tirne te present

believe to be very reliable information that
the arrangement referred to is now in effeet
and is being aeted upon.
I think all honourable senators realize the
great effort which bas been made by Canada
in the last two generations, and particularly
since the last war, to develop ou-r rnarkets in

Great Britain. On the whole, this effort has.
been very successful. .Prior to, this war our
economie situation was principally dependent
on our 'business with the Motherland, which
business I arn sure we ail hope will be resumed

33,1

when peace is restored. The magnitude of that
business is exemplified in several lines of our
production, particularly in agriculture.
It happens that at the moment I have at
hand the latest weekly report of the Commercial Intelligence Bureau, published under
the authority of the Minister of Trade and
Commerce, and on page 85 is a report of Mr.
G. R. Paterson, Animal Produets Trade Commissioner in Great Britain. Thie shows the
bacon and hog products which we shipped to
England in pre-war times, as well as last year,
and I trust the House will bear with me while
I quote a few figures to show the large exporta
we made last year. At this point it is only
fair .to say that our success with bacon is the
resuit of a policy that we have been following
ever since the Iast war, with the objeet of
establishing this product on the British market.
Mr. Paterson's report, which is dated June 12
of this year, states that prior to the outbreak
of the war we supplied fifteen per cent of the
bacon requirements of Great Britain. That
is, out of a total consumaption of 10,500,000
hundredweight we supplied 1,500,000 hundredweight. I arn speaking in round figures. I am
sure honourable members will be surprised to
note how that business grew last year. We
shipped to Great Britain in 1941 no less than
5,375,143 hundredweight. That is an increase
of 356 per cent and represents the product
from five million hogs. So it is easy to see
how important the continuation of that market

is to the Canadian farmer. While no statisties
are available as to the percentage which we
have been supplying to the BTritish mnarket
in the past year, Mr. Paterson said a conservative estimate would be 67 per cent of ail the
British requirements.
Mr. Paterson in his report says:
The British do flot favour overly fat bacon.
They regard it as neither desirable nor economie
to purchase.
That raises a question as to whether under
this arrangement, whereby the United States
will control the bacon production on this
continenit, we are going to maintain our
favourable position in the British market.
I know a little about the hog business. In
our country, under the direction of the
Governrnent department which has been
building up our bacon market in Great Britain,
we have corne almost entirely to producing
the British type of large Yorkshire hog-the
best bacon type in the world, the hog that
supplies the Wiltshire sides. In the United
States the only bacon hog is the Tamworth.
Most of their hogs, as farmer members well
know, are Poland, China, Berkshire:, Hamnpshire and several other breeds of what are
known as the shop or block hog. That hog

produces too much fat to make bacon such
as is produed in Great Britain and now in
As Mr. Paterson correctly points
Canada.
out, the fat hog is flot considered desirable in
Grcat Britain, although of course it cani ho,
and is, used in the United States.
You might well ask me how the United
States could produce s0 much bacon, because
thc Tamworth bog is net a large percentage
of their hog production. They do it by a
careful selection fromn the other breeds for
their dornestic requirements. When, however,
they corne to cxport bacon it is an entirely
different matter. 1 ean speak with some
knowledgc of the Amierican-cured smoked
sides wbich wcre supplied te us during the
last war. Tbev w-erc brought into Chicago,
proccased in Toronto, and shipped te us everseas. The bacon from those hogs, because
cf excess fat, did net cure sufficiently. Parts
around the joints werc tainted and bad te be
eut away as ivaste.
I mecntion the.se details te show yen the
great c'ire wv have taken te build up eut own
c
bog industry, which lias rcsulted in our baving
suha satisfactory place in the British mnarkct,
supplying, as I hav e said, 67 pet cent of its
b)acon requiremients; aise te justify the feeling

that kind of bacon; and, furthermore, te stress
the fear tbat the arrangement as now in effect
is likely te interfere with cur snccessful effort

Dominion, particularly in the post-war period.
Mr. Paterson in the closing sentence of bis
report gives ernphasis te tliis fear. H1e says:

best by reading a brief article which appeared
in the Saskatoon Star last week. This article
is as follows:
Grain terminals at many points in the West
are nearing capacity as harvest approaches,
and with visible stocks of grain totalling
418,000,000 bushels of all grains, Canada is
faced with the most acute storage problem in
history, it was indicated to-day in figures released by the Board of Grain Commissioners.
Stocks of all grains at the Lakehead are
reported at 130,809,000 bushels, with the
licensed capacity of elevators and annexes at
144,500,000 bushels, the board reports.
(A Fort William report yesterday said more
than 5,000 cars of grain are standing in Lakehead yards, and that more cars continue to
enter the yards, while less than 550 cars are
moving east daily.)
Grain in storage in principal elevators in
Canada was reported officially to be 373,105,000
bushels, not including stocks in transit in the
Dominion, and some 15,000,000 bushels stored
in the United States. Canada has a total
storage capacity of 601,191,319 bushels.
Grain sources said it is expected about
400,000,000 bushels will remain in Canadian
elevators as a carryover bv the end of July,
leaving room for perhaps less than 200,000,000
bushels' storage space to handle new crop grain.
How much of this crop, which has been forecast in grain circles at more than 1,000,000,000
bushels, would be available for delivery is not
known. Producers are limited to 280,000,000
bushels of wheat for delivery and it is expected
much of Western Canada's coarse grains will
be used on the farms as feed.
Present indications are that much of the
crop may have to be stored on farns.

the patience of my honourable friend from
Vancouver (Hon. Mr. McRae). He made his
inquiry in regard to this matter, I think, some
time early in June. It is a matter that covers
a wide area and involves many departments
of government. I have been pressing for a
reply for my honourable friend for some time.
I do not care to speak as to that this morning,
but I will undertake to give my honourable
friend and the Senate an answer to this
question before the House adjourns, or before
we leave here. I will also try to get some
information in regard to the matter referred
to by the honourable senator who bas just
spoken.
I move the adjournment of the debate.
The motion was agreed to.
SPECIAL WAR REVENUE BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. J. H. KING moved the second reading
of Bill 114, an Act to amend the Special War
Revenue Act.
He said: Honourable senators, I move the
second reading of this Bill. The honourable
senator from Toronto (Hon. Mr. Hayden)
has kindly consented to explain it. I am
satisfied that he will do it in a way which
will be more satisfactory to the Senate than
if I had donc it.

Hon. SALTER A. HAYDEN: Honourable
senators, before the motion for the second
reading of this Bill is put, may I give just
a brief explanation of what the Bill accomplishes? I am sure that most honourable
senators have read in the daily newspapers
the effect of the various changes in the Special
War Revenue Act, because these changes
increase taxes on items with which we come
into almost daily contact. I do not intend,
therefore, to labour the taxes which are levied
or increased by the Bill, but I shall state in
very summary form where there have beei
increases and where the imposts are in the
nature of new taxes.
May I recall that earlier in the year, with
the introduction of sugar rationing and the
increased cost of the movement of sugar from
the areas of production into uneconomic
areas, the Government made a reduction in
the excise tax of from 2 to 14 cents a pound,
to assist in the financing of that movement
and to make more effective the principle of
sugar rationing. This Bill confirms the reduction in that tax.
Then with respect to a large variety of
things there is an increase-a substantial
Hon. J. H. KING: Honourable senators, if
increase. For instance, there is an increased

statement made in Ottawa by Trade Minister
placed this figure at about
MacKinnon
200,000,000 bushels.
I think, honourable members, that the
farmers of the West will be required to store
on their farms much more than 200,000,000
bushels. In many cases storage space is not
available. Lumber is very difficult to obtain,
and many farmers who are not able to pay
the high prices for building materials will be
unable to store the grain and keep it from
I think the Government sbould
spoiling.
immediately provide some assistance to the
farmer in order that this acute storage problem may be avoided. It will be only about
three weeks before harvesting and threshing
commence; therefore, in my opinion, it is
very important that something be done without delay.
As I have stated previously, I am eager to
be able te tell the farmers upon my return
home after the adjournment just exactly what
this agreement means, and what effect it will
have on the sale of the enormous crop of
wheat that is now growing in Western Canada.

and long distance telephone calls. There is a
tax on telephone extensions. That is in the
nature of a new tax. There has been some discussion of that. There is an increase in the
tax on cigarette papers, cigarette tubes and
manufactured tobacco. This increase is substantial. The tax on soft drinks bas also been
increased a cent a bottle. The excise tax on
the dressing and dyeing of furs represents an
increase. It is also a change. Heretofore the
tax was a sales tax of 12 per cent; now it is in
the nature of an excise tax at the rate of 25 per
cent. There is an increase in the tax on playing cards, domestic wines, chocolates, candy,
confectionery, chewing gum, cigars and carbonic acid gas. There was introduced also
a new type of tax, which the Minister of
Finance chose to call a retail purchase tax,
but which I think may be popularly regarded
as a luxury tax. Its purpose is to curtail
unnecessary expenditures and to bring about
a greater saving for the purchase of war
savings certificates. etc. That proposed tax
bas subsequently been changed to some extent.
Some of the items enumerated in the
schedule as being subject to that tax have
been taken out of it and made subject to a
manufacturer's tax instead, at a higher amount.
In some instances, I think, the items lifted
out of the retail purchase tax were regarded
as not strictly in the nature of luxuries, but,
as tey would furnish considerable revenue,
the Minister felt that the change was justified. One tax which hits probably every person who travels is the tax on Pullman and
parlour car tickets. This bas been increased,
as has also the tax on berths on sleeping cars.
There is a new tax on photographie films and
projectors.
Ail these taxes, with the exception of the
transportion tax I have referred to, came into
effect on the 24th of June. The tax on tickets
for Pullman and sleeping car berths became
effective on the 29th of June.
On the 1st of July a tax on certain places of
entertainment came into force.
The provisions for this tax form a new part of the
Special War Revenue Act. The tax is imposed
not only on the cost of admission to places of
entertainment, but, as honourable senators
may have noticed here in Ottawa, on the price
of meals at places where facilities are provided
for dancing. So the scope of application of
this entertainment tax bas been very considerably increased by this measure.
With respect to chocolate, candy and confectionery, on which the Bill originally imposed
a tax of 30 per cept, a variation was made
during the progress of the Bill through the
other House, so that, effective as of July 14,
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN.

the tax on units of candy regularly retailing
at five cents, ten cents and fifteen cents will
be one cent, two cents and three cents,
respectively.
Honourable senators will also find in the
Bill an extension of the procedural sections,
the purpose of which is to take in the new
parts; and it will also be noticed that certain
sections are repealed because they no longer
have application.
In this summary way, without going into
actual percentages of increases, I have stated
the effect of the provision of this Bill 114.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill
was read the second time.
THIRD

READING

Hon. Mr. KING moved the third reading of
the Bill.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was
read the third time, and passed.
NATIONAL RESOURCES MOBILIZATION
BILL
SECOND READING-DEBATE CONTINUED
The Senate resumed from yesterday the
debate on the motion of Hon. Mr. King for the
second reading of Bill 80, an Act to amend the
National Resources Mobilization Act, 1940.
Hon. GUSTAVE LACASSE: Honourable
members of the Senate, most of you have
heard of the preacher who said no souls are
saved after the sermon has lasted for twenty
minutes. I could add that in a debate like
this no minds are convinced or opinions
changed after twenty minutes. That is why
I do not intend to speak at very great length
this morning. But even after two long days of
debate, there still are certain things that have
not been said about the very contentious
matter now facing us--things that must be
said and that I shall say.
I shall endeavour not to repeat what other
bonourable members have said, though I
realize if would be quite a feat if I entirely
succeeded in that respect. I do not wish to
imply that matter contained in previous
speeches was not interesting enough to justify
repetitio-n. Ail the speeches were most interesting. And I think that the debate we are
baving on this issue is a good thing for all
concerned, not only for those who have the
privilege of listening to it, but for the country
at large.
Nobody can say now that the
Senate of Canada is subservient to and only
a faint echo of another place. I emphasize
that point for a particular reason. We have
many times been called just a rubber stamp
office, and it would seem that events have

JULY 29, 1942

often justified that term, because ever since
I bave belonged ta this Chamber new legisiation, some of it tremendously important, bas
been diumped an us in the hast days of the
session and we have been asked ta deal wlth
it ixi a burry. The request to us bas rcpeatedly
been ta tbis effcct: "Place the stamp of your
appraval an tbis legisiation, because we must
adjourn or prarague at sucb and such a date,
or such and such an bour. Wbether yau have
donc anything throughout the session or nat,
you must nat put taa mucb timc an the
measures that rémain ta 'be dealt witb. Hurry
up, because we wan.t ta go bomne." Well, I
object ta tbat, and I arn giad that we have
had this debate an wbat happens ta be anc
cf the most cantraversial issues that bave ever
crept into Canadian polities.
1 feel most strongly about this because of
%what I have just read in a paper dated the
25tb of July. The article ixi question le
headed: "Con.scription in farce by autumn.
Earlier if second front, is forecast." 1 do not
cbject ta that, if it is the view af the writer,
for it is bis own business wbat he tbinks. But
wbat f'oiiows sbauid be very interesting ta
bonourabie mnembers. The writer says:
Now that Bill 80 bas given the power ta
bring conscription if or when necessary...
Tbis bonourabie Hanse is stili debating Bill
.80, but a newspaper publisbed a few days
ago speaks of the Bill as if it bad already
been passed. That is, the Senate is ignared
.aitogether. 1 believe every bonourabie member wiil take as strang exception as I do ta

sucb iack af respect for what is, after ail, the
higber pariiamentary Chiamber of Canada, a
legisiative branch set up by the Fathers of
Confederatian for some purpase. This Bill
80 is not law yet, and it will not become
iaw until the Senate of Canada decides that it
should.
But i6 conscription really the issue? 0f
,course it is, despite what we bave repeately
beard in the recent past. I refer, first, ta

what was said in speeches macle during the

plebiscite campaign and since. That the
people might be inducedi ta vote "Yes,"' they
wcre told that by s0 doing tbey would not be
voting i favour of conscription. It happens
that the maj ority "Yes"' does mean conscriptiaxi after ail. Why diseuss this naw, if it is
a foregone conclusion, that the Bill is aiready
the law, as Mr. Grattan 0'Leary stated in
the Toronto Star Weekiy, an July 25, in the
article ta whlch I have already referred?
Why discnss thc question at ail, since it has
already been decided by the Press? Well,
there is a very important reason why we are
justified ini having this discussion here ta-day.

339

On the 23rd of July this year the Prime Minister stated li another place, as reported at
page 4987 of House- of Commons Hansard:
I cannot make it too plain that when this
Bill passes bath Hanoses-Here is a maxi wba remembers there is a
Senate in Canada, after ail.
1 cannot make it toc, plain that when this
Bill passes both Hanses, as I believe it will
pass, and is assented ta, the Government will
have been given by Parliament power to conscript men for service overseas. That power
will rest in the Government. It will be there.
The policy of the Government is ta exercise
that power when it believes it necessary to do
so, when it is necessary ta resart ta conscription
ta make Canada's war effort more effective.
When the decisian is made by the Government
and when it is made-that setties the
-if
matter as f ar as conscription is concerned.
Conscription wiii have been enacted; the Government will have declared that it je necessary
for the carrying on of the war. There will be
no question of referring that matter ta Pariiarrent at ail. And may I add this, that if
that should happen hetween now and the end
of this year there could not he a debate on it,
even if some honourable inembers might wish
ta have one.
That is one important reasan why we are
justified in discussing this matter naw. It is
now or neyer.
May 1 say, at the very beginning of my
remarks, that I depiore the political and partisan turn or trend that bas beexi given
ta this discussion by one or twa bonourabie
members. 1 do not intend ta follow themn on
that ground. The situation is taa grave for
anc ta indulge in thundering one's resentment
against a party which, for a great many years,
bas beexi luekier at the polis than one's own
party, in Quebcc or eisewhere in Canada. I
may refer ta that later, however, fram a mare
serious point af view.
Naw let us came ta the issue of the day.
-No man-nat even my honourabie friend from
Vancouver South (Hon. Mr. Farris) or my
boxiaurabie friend from Mille les (Han. Mr.
Prévast)-has a greater admiration for the
present Prime Minister of Canada than I
myseif have. I cancur without any reservation in what was said about bim hast night
by these twa banourable gentlemen. and I
repeat, with the same sincerity as wben I first
uttered the words, wbat I said about the
Prime Minister in this Chamber on the 27tb
of January hast:
Ta be perfectly candid, I fuiiy behieve that
had we flot had a man of the prudence of the
present Prime Minister in skilfully choosing a
middle course poiicy, we should have seen civil
war. I amn absolutely frank about it. That in

JULY 29, 1942
I refer to the Financial Times of Montreal.
Its issue of the 3rd of this month contains
the following:
It is the belief of many more sound-thinking
people heremeaning Ottawa, for the dispatch is written by
its correspondent in the Capital-that there is no use sending good Canadian
troops into Quebec to round up any deserters.
Those who do not accept the conscription call
when it comesAgain taking a lot for granted.
-will be apprehended if available, but if they
take to the bush they can stay there. In other
words, it is not worth while sending a good
soldier after a bad one. This is of course al]
hypothetical, but it will be recalled that the
sylvan trail was a popular one in the last war.
This is the kind of stuff fed to our peoiple
to consolidate Canadian un-ity. I challenge
any honourable member to refer me to anything as sordid as that in the whole French
Press of Canada, whether Nationalist or not.
To those who may challenge my loyalty to
the Empire because of my opposition to
conscription, I would respectfully suggest they
examine the brand of their own loyalty to
Canada-their country and mine.
In taking my present stand I feel, I am in
fairly good company, for it is not se long
ago that it seemed to be a free-for-all race
among the leaders of all political parties in
Canada to declare themselves against conscription. The most spectacular c-hange of
front was that of our friend Bob Manion. He
felt the sentiment of the country as a good
doctor will feel the pulse of a patient. Su
he decided in 1940 that conscription was not
popular, and arranged his election campaign
accordingly.
I do not blame him for his
course Of action. Unfortunately for him and
his party, the results were quite disappointing.
Then along came his successor, Mr. Hansen,
who, if I remember correctly, in the late
fall of 1941 was net so enthusiastic for conscription, judging from what he said both
in the House of Commons and outside. He
too admitted that conscription was not popular throughout the Dominion-,although it
remained so, I suppose, in some hot spots,
such as Toronto. Honourable senators may
retort, "But conditions have changed." Indeed,
conditions have changed. In 1939 and 1940
the foe was three thousand miles away;
now he is hammering at our shores. That
is why I am firmly convinced it is wrong to
send young men abroad when this country
needs to be protected.
More than that, I feel that I am in very
interesting company when I observe that four
officers in uniform, four full-fledged members

of our Canadian Army, fearlessly took the
same stand, either by their votes or their
speeches, in another place. Will anybody in
this House be ungenerous or ungrateful enough
to go so far as to challenge the loyalty of
those four officers, three of whom were veterans
of the last war, and the fourth of whom was
the son of the man who gave his life to consolidate Canada's unity-Ernest Lapointe.
Now let us listen, honourable members, to
the voice of. someone who will speak to us
from the grave. Who will question the
patriotism of the great Canadian who for
many years was the respected and beloved
leader of this House, and whose memory we
all revere? Here is what Senator Dandurand
once told his distinguished friend, Mr. Gabriel
Hanotaux, one of the greatest writers and
statesmen of France, some time after the war
of 1914-1918. Here is what our dear old
friend said, as I had it from his own lips:
"Never again shall ,the boot-soles of our
Canadian soldiers kiss the pavements of
Paris." "Never" means a long time, honourable senators, and nobody can say that the
lips which uttered that solemn warning were
not those of a true son of Canada, one who
was probably more conversant with international affairs than anybody else on this side
of the Atlantic.
I have noticed that net one single argument advanced by honourable members who
take the same stand as I do in this House
has been answered. Not one single argument!
Other arguments have been made; dozens of
affirmations, most of them gratuitous, have
been made; but I am at a loss to find one
single instance in which one direct response
was made to one direct argument.
There is one point on which I want to dwell
for a few minutes. because I have thought
that, on the face of it, it is one of the most
captious arguments presented in faveur of
conscription. It was an argument advanced
by the honourable senator from Montarville
(Hon: Mr. Beaubien), which was based on
the ground of justice. The honourable gentleman has a way of dramatizing his views which
makes them very impressive. He asks: "Why
should a man enjoy the pleasures of his home
in serenity and security when his neighbour
goes abroad and sacrifices his life for the
rights and privileges whieh the man at home
enjoys?"
I think that is the argument
briefly put. Well, it is an argument of some
merit. But can that argument not be applied
to men in all callings of life? Is it not unjust
and unfair, for instance, that I should enjoy
all the benefits and comforts of the Senate
of Canada, and the sympathy and interest of
such a wonderful audience, while other men

SENATE

who are just as worthy as I am of such a
privilege should be excluded because they have
chosen to be confined in the cloisters of faraway missions, or to lead a dog's life in purauit of an ideal which we cannot fully appreciate? It is for anyone a matter of choice
and free will. That is where the true merit
lies. It may be that I am prejudiced-if so, I
admit it-but I happen to belong to a profession which during the last war faced all
kinds of incidents which were challenging from
the standpoint of charity and justice. It may
be that because of that I am liable to exaggerate in certain directions and to have a very
strong feeling against conscription.
Hon. Mr. HORNER: Will the honourable
senator permit me to ask him a question?
To whom was he referring when be spoke of a
"dog's life"? What life was that?
Hon. Mr. LACASSE: I was referring, not
to any particular person, but to men in
general.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE:

To the Army?

Hon. Mr. LACASSE: Oh. no. I am sorry
if my remarks were interpreted in that way.
I hope my honourable friends opposite did
not think I meant that.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: I did.
Hon. Mr. LACASSE: Then I will try to
make it abundantly clear, as Mr. Bennett
used to say. I was alluding to men who, of
their own choice, turned their backs on the
legitimate pleasures of life and, for instance,
became missionaries, Catholie or Protestant,
and were predestined to lead a dog's life in
some far-distant country, for the love of
God and the salvation of souls. Is that clear
now? I never had in mind the members of
our Army, and I hope my honourable friend
from Saskatchewan North (Hon. Mr. Horner)
believes what I say.
Now I come back to the incident which I
was about to cite, and which may be
responsible for the very strong feelings I have
about conscription. As I have said, it may
be that because of it I am prejudiced; but I
am referring to the same justice spoken of
by the honourable senator from Montarville.
During the war of 1914-1918 conscription
became law, and the officers of the Government began to search the country and line up
the boys. In those days, if I remember wellI was a doctor then, as I am to-day-I was
not called upon, as I am to-day, to examine
the prospective recruits. That was done by
semi-medical-semi-military
boards; so the
family doctor had no say in the matter. Here
was a boy of my own town who was picked up
by the "black-and-tans" of those days, if I

one camp to another, and kicked from one
hospital to another, until in some hospital in
Halifax ho reached the shores of the Atlantic.
He was called a slacker from beginning to
end. Then ho died. He just died! His death
was just an incident, was it not? He just
died! But the medical officer who was called
upon to sign the death certificate had to find
something to put into it, for never to my
knowledge has it been discovered anywhere in
medicine that being a slacker is a disease.
So he had to find something. He thoroughly
examined the case, and ho performed a postmortem, and then, but only then, ho discovered a tumour on that boy's brain. I do
not know of any tumour which is called
"slackeritis" or anything of that kind. But
that man had been branded as a slacker, as a
coward, and he had suffered the consequences
of being mistreated.
That is the kind of justice one finds in this
improved system of recruiting that is called
conscription. If I had not been the fa.mily
doctor of this young man, nobody would have
known anything about this case. And when
the body was brought home and I removed
that man's military cap, I discovered by feeling his scalp through his hair that an autopsy
had been performed. I am fairly familiar, of
course, with what a body looks like after an
autopsy. I found where the incision had been
made. That is how I discovered the whole
story.

That possibly is one instance out of a thousand, possibly one out of a hundred, possibly
one out of five, possibly the only instance of
its kind; but even if it be the only instance, I
cannot call it justice.
Let me say to the honourable senator from
Montarville (Hon. Mr. Beaubien), and to al[
honourable members, so far as that is concerned, that I take off my hat to our gallant lads
wbo are fighting overseas after enlisting voluntarily-wbich adds to their glory. I take off
ny bat also to the brave boys who, with an
equally cheerful patriotism, have bidden farewell te their folks and have gone to train in
distant camps, in order that they may protect
all that is dear to them against a menacing
foe. In the ranks of both groups stand our
own sons. They are entitled to the eternaI
gratitude of the nation of which they are
worthy children and heroes.
I know that what I have said is enough to
prove that the continuous preaching of many

JULY 29, 1942
Canadians, including myself, at election time
as wel as between elections, against the conscription of man-power for overseas service,
should not be regarded by anyone as political
expediency, but rather as a national doctrine
in which its protagonists have believed during
all those years, and in which they still believe
more than' ever to-day. I was not a nonparticipationist yesterday, and I am not an
isolationist to-day. I am dead against that
isolationism which my honourable friends have
in mind. But I am speaking right now of
another brand of isolationism which they have
not in mind, the isolationism of those who are
viciously trying to isolate one province from
the body of Confederation. Those are the
most dangerous isolationists of the day, and I
shall refer to them in a moment or two.
I have stated that I am also opposed to
this Bill because the fact which is invoked to
justify it has been and still is wrongly and
unfairly interpreted. I come to that point
now. Long before the plebiscite vote was
taken some persons connected with the Press
began to cultivate a certain public opinion
to the effect that a "Yes" vote would be
given in all provinces except Quebec. Those
persons did their best to create that impression from the start, and they succeeded, if
you want to look at it that way, for Quebec
voted "No" and the other eight provinces
voted "Yes."
After the vote these writers
declared proudly that their prophecies had
been right. They almost rejoiced over it.
It was bad for Canada, but it was good for
them. Well, did those people draw a correct
inference? I admit that Quebec is, constitutionally, only one-ninth .of Canada. But
it also happens that all French Canadians are
not living within the confines of that one
expression "French
When the
province.
Canada" is applied exclusively 'to Quebec it
is a misnomer. It may be all right for
tourist propaganda purposes, but it does not
express the truc fact. The point I want to
make is that French Canada is not merely
one province out of nine, but one-third of
the total population of the country. It is
precisely because more than 650,000 "No"
votes were registered by persons residing
outside the province of Quebec, French
Canadians and ot'hers, that I am speaking on
this Bill to-day, for I believe that such a
large number of people should, in a democratic
nation like Canada, have a voice in this
Chamber to express their views and explain
their stand. I am the first one to mention
this standpoint in the Senate, and I think I
am perfectly justified in doing so. If I am
not, Canada is no longer a democracy, and
we might as well admit it now.

Some honourable members might rermind
me that I did not oppose the plebiscite in

this House last January. Indeed I did not.
But no one can say I was over-enthusiastie
about it. To refresh the memory of honourable senators, may I just repeat what I
said on the 27th of January in connection
with it. This will be found on page 34 of
Senate Hansard:
What is Mr. King doing to-day? Realizing
to the full the situation in Canada, lie does one
thing: he makes a most generous concessionmuch more generous, in fact, than I would have
made were I Prime Minister of Canada.
And further:
I think that is the honest way to go about
it, and I repeat that I do not think I would
have gone so far myself.
And I want to draw the attention of honourable members to this particular statement:
I think the Government should make an effort
to place the matter before the public in the
most impartial way in order that the people
nay decide intelligently. There should be no
intimidation or terrorism.
But there was.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: May I ask the honourable
gentleman a question right there? Did the
Government do that?
Hon. Mr. LACASSE: What?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: What you said it should
do?
Hon. Mr. LACASSE: No. That is why I
voted "No." And I will explain why I did so.
I had just about made up my mind to- trust
Mr. Mackenzie King once more, to support
him even as far as the plebiscite, although his
stand was antagonistic to my own personal
views.
What happened?
My honourable
friend from Vancouver South (Hon. Mr.
Farris) mentioned last night the bitterness of
the opposition that was met by Sir Wilfrid
Laurier under similar circumstances, and
mentioned an article or poster which proclaimed: "A vote for Laurier is a vote for
the Kaiser." Well, will honourable members
believe this, that during the plebiscite campaign a Minister of the Crown said that in
his opinion whoever voted "No" was siding
with Hitler? Is there much difference between
the two?
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: Yes; a lot.
Hon. Mr. LACASSE: Well, that is a question of personal opinion, and I do not feel
the same way as my friend about it. I contend
it was the sane brand of terrorism in order
to intimidate the electors of Canada.
That was what turned me and caused me
to vote "No."
And I am not ashamed to

Hon. Mr. LACASSE: I have heard the
motto "Dieu et mon Droit," which is the
motto of the King himself, often quoted in this
Chamber, and nobody ever took any exception
to it. I think we may find in that motto a
solution of all our problems in just two words:
"Fearless and Faithful." Is it such a calamity
to quote those two words here? What is
derogatory in that quotation? Whatever may
happen, let us all be fearless of the foe and
fearless of the future, because we are confident that we are on the side of right and
justice. and that sooner or later justice will
prevail. Let us also be faithful to the traditions of our country, to all that is dear to
our hearts, faithful to the extent of defending
those traditions and those human, spiritual
and material resources by shedding our blood

The Senate resumed at 3 p.m.
Hon. SALTER A. HAYDEN: Honourable
senators, I am supporting this Bill. There
was much that I might have said and that I
had intended to say in support of the measure,
but as it has already been said, and well said,
I do not intend to indulge in any repetition.
I think I may say, however, that the Bill is
timely and necessary. I think it rounds out
a plan of compulsory service, and in the circumstances in which we find ourselves at the
present time, I believe it is necessary that the
Government should possess full and complete
power for the defence of Canada. It should
lie possible for the armed forces of Canada
to be sent wherever, in the opinion of our
leaders, tliey arc required to ensure safety,

scems te me that whether, in consequence of

JULY 29, 1942
the plebiscite vote, you give the Government
full and complete power to send men overseas
whenever in its opinion the necessity arises,
or whether you enact substantively some
form of Military Service Act to conscript for
overseas service, the effect is the same.
We are not sending men overseas simply
because we want to send them. We shall
send men overseas to wherever they may
be required to go, once it has been decided by
those charged with that duty that it is in the
interest of an efficient prosecution of the
war to send them; and the order for their
going would be exactly the same kind of
order whether it had been substantively
enacted that men must be conseripted for
overseas service or whether the Government
had the power, unhampered and unfettered,
to send them overseas whenever the need
.should arise.
I think that the leaders of the Government
of Canada, which is a member of the United
Nations, are in a position to know when and
where the need may arise, and we have to
trust some persons to take the responsibility
îor making such a decision. I am not prepared to assume that responsibility. Frankly,
I do not know enough about the situation.
I do know, however, that our enemies are
active in every part of the world, and I
realize that if we are to overcome them we
must work in co-operation and harmony with
the other nations, and must distribute our
forces in such a way as to make for the
greatest progress towards the end wh.ich we
.are all trying to reach, namely, the defeat of
the enemy. Whatever that may involve, however great the sacrifice, we must be prepared
to face it, because we are engaged in a war
to a finish.
As far as I am concerned, these discussions
assume a sort of academic significance, because
of the larger and the real issue which faces
us to-day. I say that we must be prepared
to arm our leaders with full and ample
authority to do whatever may be needed,
whenever needed, even if it involves the
disposition of our forces in various parts
of the world.
Something bas been said in the course of
this debate, and also, from time to time, in
the newspapers and by representatives of
various organizations, to the effect that only
a total effort for total war can assure victory
to our side, and that a total effort for total
war will be of no avail unless we have what
has been described as conscription for overseas service. Well, with the passage of this
Bill we shall, in effect, be in a position to
send our forces anywhere in the world for

service in the best interests of an efficient
prosecution of the war. That surely includes
conscription for overseas.
But in my opinion it is not enough to say
that once you have conscription for overseas,
or once the restriction or limitation in the
National Resources Mobilization Act has been
removed, you thereby and at once have a total
effort for total war. Those very people who have
been agitating pro or con-for both sides of
the question have been discussed, at times
with harsh and violent language-can show
their sincerity when this Bill becomes law
by joining one hundred per cent in support
of our total effort and thus makmg it a real
total effort for total war. It has been well
said that along the road of total effort for
total war lies the only sure means of gaining
eventual victory and peace. I think it can
equally. well be said that along that very
same road there must be sacrifice and understanding, co-operation and trust.
During the course of this debate, particularly, I think, in the utterances of the leader
of the Government and the leader of the
other side of the House, there has been a
high standard of calm and temperate discussion. The debate has been highly nonprovocative. I think we have reached a
stage in the prosecution of this war where
the seriousness of the situation is so apparent
that we should all firmly resolve that for the
duration of the war we will lay aside, even
if we cannot entirely obliterate them from
our minds, the political arts of peace-time and
attempt to be as constructive and co-operative
as we can to restore confidence among all the
people, to the end that we may make a total
effort for total war.
In ordinary times I might feel disposed
to take strong objection to some things that
were said in this debate, and particularly to
the manner in which they were said. However,
I am firmly convinced at this time nothing
can be gained by throwing in a few sticks to
feed the flame. Nothing can be gained by
talking about particular cases, for you cannot
argue anything properly in that way. By discussing particular cases you can inflame
passion and prejudice and stir up resentment,
but that would not be helpful to our country
just now. I must admit that in the province
of Ontario, from which I come and of which
I am very proud, we have not been entirely
guiltless in the matter of violent discussion
on certain issues. And in all the provinces we
have seen the spectacle of distrust stirring up
the people and to some degree estranging race
from race and class from class. We have even
heard it whispered: "Why should we be concerned about any person else? We are not

SENATE
our brofhiers' keepers." The probiem of how
to overcome this situation is the one that gives
me( the greatest concern, because so long as
we have divisions and dissensions, so long
as there is a possjbiljty of increa,.ed sectionaiin in Canada, we cannot bave a reai
total effort for total war.

can say is that it certainly lies beyond Canada
and its territorial waters. If that be so, then,
once this Bill is passed, the Government will
have power to make such disposition of our
armed forces as it may see fit, with a view to
the safeguarding of Canada and the efficient
prosecution of the war in which we are
engaged.
My main purpose in speaking to-day, honourable senators, is to ask of you, and through
you the people of Canada, that we throw
aside the spirit of dissension, quarrelling, and
bitter disagreement and try to cloak ourselyes
in a spirit of co-operation and trust. The
cause in which we are engaged at the present
time is too great to be endangered. The
stakes at issue in this conflict are the preservation of our way of life, of our freedom and
of our conception of Christian morality. The
outcome of this struggle will determine
whether in the future we shall be slaves or
free men. These stakes are so important
that we cannot afford to dissipate our energies
and strength on anything that will detract
from a concentrated total effort for total war.
I cannot think of any better way to close
my remarks than by quoting some words that
were used 'by Thomas D'Arcy McGee prior
to the passage of Confederation. He was
appealing to the people of Canada, as it then
was, to unite in the interest of the greater
Canada, and he outlined a course for theni
to follow. Among other things he said:
All we have to do is each for himself to
keep down dissensions which can only weaken,
impoverish and keep back the country, each
for himself to do all lie can to increase the
wealth of the country and its strength and
reputation.
I echo those words to-day. The present duty
of every one of us is, each for himself in his
own way and to the full extent of his power,
to attempt to restore confidence, trust, understanding and co-operation, to the end that
we may be able to harness all our talen-ts
and devote them to a total effort for a total
war.
Hon. J. FERNAND FAFARD: Honourable senators, I shall not take more than a
few minutes of the House's time to explain
my stand on Bill 80, now before us-the
National Resources Mobilization Bill.
For the last quarter of a century I have
talcen an active part in the political life of
the province of Quebec, and I am glad to say
that my views on Bill 80 are identical with
those I held in 1917, and my reasons are the
same. I shall not repeat the arguments in
favour of my stand, because they have been
ex'pounded more eloquently than I could do
it myself by the honourable member from
-Grandville (Hon. Sir Thomas Chapais).

I have no confidence in the conscription
measure submitted to us, especially since the
voluntary system has given splendid results,
and since military experts themselves say that
tbey would prefer a single enlisted man in the
Army to ten conscripts.
In all spheres Canada has contributed ber
share, in the Army as well as in the Air Force.
The people understand that we must be ready
to defend Canada, and that is the reason why
voluntary enlistments have been so numerous.
Conscription at the present time would impede
our war effort, because it would create bitterness between the different provinces of Canada and also undermine the confidence of
the people in their governments.
During the last two years, like many others,
I have advised those who came to me for
counsel to enlist because it was for the defence
of Canada only. If I were to accept the Bill
at present before the House, I should
approve of the Government sending overseas
the men who have. joined the Army for the
defence of Canada only. I have not the least
hesitation in saying that I cannot accept this
Bill, because it would mean betraying those
I have represented for a quarter of a century.
I regret that so many speeches have been
made criticizing Canada's war effort. The
criticism voiced by our opponents is unjustified. It is a political manouvre, but it does
us much harm in the other countries. Let us
try rather to publicize our war effort outside
of Canada. The manufacture of munitions bas
attained a level which I did not think possible
before the war. Our shipyards are producing
at an astonishing rate. Canada has become
the air training centre of the Empire. Such
facts and many others should be known, not
only by the British and American governmonts, but also by the British and American

peoples. A certain class of people in this
country have apparently chosen criticism as
their maximum war effort. The first object
of their criticism is the province of Quebec.
They also criticized the Hong Kong expedition,
but what would they have said if the Government had refused to send any troops? Then
they criticize the Admiralty on account of the
torpedoings in the St. Lawrence. They even
praise the skill and the courage of our enemies.
They criticize France, poor France, and they
already forget that in 1917 France was the
shield of civilization. Read our papers, all
the papers published in the Dominion. You
will seldom find a condemnation of German
barbarity and treaty violations. It is obvious
that they are more interested in embarrassing
the Government than in waging total war.
Canada has done ber share in this war, and
every province deserves to be congratulated.

SFNATE
Quebec also has done her share, ýand, a generous
share at that. Quebee desires victoýry for the
Allied armies. Quebec is opposed to conscription for overseas service, because Quebec
knows only one Motherland, Canada. The
blood ties whieh once bound us to Europe
have almost completely disappeared; we are
left with the lone British tie, which unites us
ail. After the battle of the Plains of Abraham,
60,000 Frenchmen were left in this country.
They were Sa poor that they did not have
the money to pay their fare back to France.
They armed themselves with courage, staod
around our missionaries, and cleared the beautiful farms that you now see along the shores
of the St. Lawrence. During the war of 191418 we had our share of the 60,000 Canadians
wlho naw sleep on the Euiropean battie-fields.
Nevertheless the original population of 60,000
bas grown to 5,000,000, two millions of whom
have rnigrated to the United States.
It is easy to understand why we have so
mach) love for a country which bas been sa
generous to us. When the nurnerous other
races of this country shall have learned ta
know Canada as weIl as we know it, tbey
wvill agree with aur feeling that Canada is the
only country wbere we want ta lire and die.
If ever this patriotic feeling is sbared througbout Canadýa, fromn ocean ta ocean, we shall no

to give it carte blanche to ensure the security
of our country and to do the utrnost to
achieve victory.
Let me quote from a speech I made in
Edmonton on the plebisci-te, of which this
Bill is the logical sequence. I said:
As far as I am concerned, I am so conscious
of the immediate danger menacing our country
that I am most emphatic about it, and think
it is the duty of every good Canadian to answer
by an overwhelming affirmative on April 27 for
the following reasons:
To give the Government complete freedom of
action in the best interests of our country.
Everyone knows it is not the time, when the
storm is raging on the sea and the boat in the
process of sinking, for the captain to ask from
the shore whether lie should push the bar to
the right or to the left to save it.
At the present time, the storm is raging with
fury everywhere, abroad as well as on our own
coasts, and very soon it will no doubt be in
the Gulf of St. Lawrence. Therefore, it is of
the utmost urgency that the great Canadian who
is in charge of Canada's destinies should have
complete mastery of the situation, and we in
return should have absolute confidence in his
Government.
There bas been, among some people, considerable confusion about the plebiscite. It
does not implicitly mean conscription for overseas service. It is up to Parliament to decide
on this later if it is deemed necessary for our
safeguarding. It means, before all else, unity
-unity of purpose, unity of action, freedom to
act according to circumstances, freedom to act
anywhere.
Canada actually is making a tremendous war
effort-an effort which, according to our population. is equal to that of any nation now at
war, and one has to be blind not to see it.
Surely it is not necessary to add conscription
for overseas service to that effort in order to
make it more evident or to convince the other
nations. Still, if things were becoming so bad
that our Government deemed conscription for
overseas necessarv as the sole neans of avoiding
defeat and ensuring our survival, I am sure
there is no one who would not esteem it an
honour to take a share in our defence. I for
one would gladlv endorse it, for the simple
reason that I have always believed and said
that it is preferable for us to win this war on
European soil than to wait for it on our shores.
It would then be too late.
I spoke again later, and I should like to be
permitted for a very few minutes to repeat
part of what I then said. It was this:
As a representative in the Senate, allow me
to appeal to your loyalty, and to request you
to vote "Yes" on April 27. We are going
through very tragic daysThose days were very tragic, but I think the
present is still more tragic.
We are going through very tragic days, through
moments of anxiety. We must get together;
each of us has a determined part to play in
this conflict, and we must resolve to win or die.
You may be assured that our fate is at stake
at this moment, and we should be wrong if we
closed our eyes to the danger which threatens

us. This is not a time to equivocate or to
debate upon the merits of conscription for
overseas service. These debates are useless
and are painful to hear in times like the ones
through which we are passing, and they throw
a discredit which will not soon disappear.
At present there is no question about conscription for overseas service; what we want is
to give Parliament a free hand to act according
to its judgment in the light of actual or future
events. We must give it a free hand to take
whatever steps are necessary to secure victory.
Then I painted a little word picture of the
war, after which I continued:
In the Atlantic, German submarines are near
our shores, and every day sink our ships. The
mastery of the Atlantic is at stake. The enemy
is drawing closer to us; everywhere lie is asserting his superiority; and you wonder, my dear
compatriots, that the Government, which is
aware of this threatening situation, is now
asking you to release it from its pledge not to
impose conscription for overseas service. You
are wondering why the change of opinion. There
is nothing surprising in that. A promise is
not a dogma. Have not circumstances altered?
Is not the whole world upset? Are we not
assisting in a universal revolution? Are there
not contradictions in everything which surrounds us? One would think that Providence
was actually laughing at human weakness, and
wished to test humanity to its extreme limits.
There is an old proverb which says: "God
helps those who help themselves." The Government is asking you to help yourselves by voting
"Yes," in order that all discussions and misunderstandings may cease, and that national
unity may be re-established and our own
preservation secured. Do not doubt that if
Germany wins the war in Europe we shall be
the next victim. And what a victim! Read
Colin Ross's book on Canada. It will be a
revelation to you of German ambitions in regard
to our country.
The Government could make use of its legal
right to have overseas service imposed by vote
of the House. Everyone bas been requesting it
to do so. The Government is empowered to
take all means to guarantee the security of
Canada. But our Prime Minister is honest;
lie is conscious of his duty as head of the
country, and respectful of his pledges, and so
did not want to use these powers. He is so
honest that he asks us to free him from his
pledges in order that lie may be given a free
hand to take the steps necessary to secure
victory.
This does not mean that conscription for
overseas service will necessarily be applied. It
does not mean that because conscription for
overseas was not on the programme Canada's
war effort has been negligible. One would be
blind who did not see the transformation which
has occurred in Canada's war production. We
are the arsenal of the Empire. Before a very
grave threat, common to all, the Allies
have pooled, without any restrictions, all their
resources, their man-power and their determination to win. Would the French Canadians
be the only ones to ask exemption from the
law? Would we be the only ones to bide behind
out-of-date pledges in order to avoid fulfilling
our duty, which consists .ist as much in fighting
overseas as in being prepared against the
destruction and invasion of our country? If,

want our sons ta hold their heads high after

their duty in the way of voluntary enlistment
for overseas service. If we register a negative
decision on the plebiscite, we shall counteract
the result of such noble and generous action.
We should be the first to take the initiative

Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. A. MARCOTTE: Honourable senators, at the outset of my remarks I would ask
your indulgence, not for what I have to say,
but for the manner in which I shall say it. I
still feel the effects of an operation that I had
some little time ago, and it is difficult and
painful for me to speak. I know of your patience, and I shall try to be concise and clear.
It has often been stated, and I believe it to
be so, that this Chamber is the bulwark of the
ininorities; that this is the place where rights
are preserved and will be preserved at all
times. As a representative of a minority I
feel it my duty to defend the rights of that
ininority and to protest against the abuses,
calumnies, lies and even threats which are
thrown at it.
We are living through terrible days. Wars
have at all times engendered hatred. This
may be understood as between belligerents,
but not between citizens of the same country
at a time when they are fighting in a common
cause against the same enemies, and praying
for the same victory.
Canada is not used to war. She never had
any on ber own account except this one. After
having enjoyed peace for over a century,
lon. Mr. BLAIS.

Canada went to war in 1914 as a part of the
British Empire and very nobly did, ber share.
That, for Canada, was not a war of conquest;
it was a contribution towards what was hoped
would be a lasting peace for the wonld at
large, and more especially for the British
Empire.
During the last years of that war a bitter
controversy arose between the two main elements of our people as to the ways of raising
men for our armies, and the word "conscription" became a word meaning hate, distrust,
vengeance. The story is repeating itself now,
under circumstances which in some ways are
vastly different, but the results will be the
same in the end if a study is not made of the
problem and a solution is not found.
During the years I have been in this Chamber I have on several occasions affirmed my
sincere belief in British institutions, and my
absolute conviction that under the British
flag, under British institutions, we French
Canadians have enjoyed, and are still enjoying, liberties unknown by a conquered people
anywhere else in the world.
Not only here in the Senate, but elsewhere
as well, in times of peace as in times of war,
I have preached that conviction, have written
on it, and have advocated it in my publie and
private life. I have always been in earnest
when I have asked my compatriots to study
conditions here and elsewhere and to compare
our fate with the fate of minorities in other
countries. I am satisfied that French Canadians, with few exceptions, will believe as I
do, if that study is made seriously.
What, then, is the cause of the present
controversy? So much has been written and
published on this problem, so many speeches
have been made on it during the last few
months, that it seems unnecessary to cover
the field. I shall confine myself, therefore,
to some historical facts, well known and undisputed, on which I base my own point of view.
The loyalty of the French Canadians to
Canada has never been doubted at any time,
nor by anyone. Canada is the only country
the French Canadian knows as his own.
Canada is his homeland, and has been since
1763. The French Canadian is not French;
he is not English; he is a Canadian and a
British subject who speaks French.
Just a few years after they became English
subjects, in 1776, the French Canadians gave
the first proof of their loyalty to England.
It was the sort of proof which has been
recognized throughout the history of the
world as a true test-the test of blood. The
same proof was given in 1812 and in 1914,
and it is being given now.

JULY 29, 1942
Engiand has beon at war several -times sinco
Canada became English, and for weli over a

century Canada was neyer cailed upon or
forcod to contrihute mon to these wars, except
for the protection of Canadian soi].
During the Sudan war in Central Africa,
Sir John A. Macdonald refused to send men
as a contribution by Canada.

Most homour-

able gentlemen wili remember that during
the war with the Boers in South Africa protests were muade by Quebec against the sending cf the first Canadian contingent. The
Govornment stated that it was not a precedenýt.
The same is true as te the second, the third
the fourth and the other contingents. It was
always promised-or pledged, since this word
is ini faveur now-that; the sending of these
contingents would net; croate a precedent.
Honourable senaters wilI remember aise the
bitter contreversies on the navy question and
the electiens cf 1911.
1 come te the war in 1914. The statement
w-as muade hy Sir Wilfrid Laurier -that wo
sheuld be in that war, alonggide England and
France, te the last man, the last dollar. But
it was te ho a veluntary contribution. Sir
Robert Borden had promised the same thing.
The conscriptien issue was created in 1917.

.Sir Wilfrid Lauricr epposed conscriptionfonglt it ail ever the country. It became Iamand was acccpte<l witli reinctance. But it tvas
accepted.
Ever since the w-ai- censcription lias becu
used by the Liberai party a-t every eleetion,
especially in' the province cf Quobec, wherle
w-o had what is call a "bloc selide." Tiore
w-as an exceptien in 1930, net in the use cf
conscription, as an argurment, but in the
resuit.
Came the war iii 1939, and tîte election iii
1940. AI] the parties seeking election declared
they were opposed te conscription for everscas service. The Liheral party was returned
te pewer with the largest mal erity oveïrecerded. Everyene knows that although every
leader had stated that ho was against conscriptien, in Quebec the people wore convinced
they would ho safer on that ground with the
Liberals in power than with the Censervatives.
In the Quehec provincial election cf 1939
that sentiment had prevailed, regardless cf the
Duplessis programme.
Even after the f ail cf Franco in June, 1940,
even after Dunkirk, and the mastering of
practically the whoeocf Europe by the Axis,
the same pledge was given by our Government. The more prenunciation cf the word
"econscription" was regarded as a crime against
unity in Canada, a detriment te aur war

353

effort. The Mobilizatien Act was passed, but
section 3 was a renewai of the pledge of no
change in policy.
Then came Pearl Harbour and our declaration of -war against Japan, and we had the
plebiscite. Let us pass over the Wording of
the question asked and consider the meaning
of it.
Just a few days ago the Prime Minister was
complaining that ho had been accused of
having inisled the public on the plébiscite.
Well, lot us take the Prime Minister at lis
ewn werds, giving to themn their true meaning.
We shall also beliove the leaders of the other
parties. What did they say? «I shall quote
from a copy of the House of Commons Dobates
which was sent out by the Bureau of Public
Information and no doubt received by, ail
honourable members. On Juno 10, 1942, the
Prime Ministor quoted from a speech he
broadcast on April 7, when he said:
The Goverumient; is not; askiug you to say
whether or neot conscription should ha adopted.
'That re?;ponsibility the (4overnment is asking
you to leave te itsolf, aud to Parliamout, with
P-itire freedom to decide the question on its
nierits.

He addcd later on:
Lý.t me etuphasize tinit fact. Tiiose who tell
c-ou that eonscription is the issue are misleadylg
ou. The sole purpose of the l)lehiscite is
teo obtain for the Governinent. and for Parliament, a pei-fectly- free hanci in dealing with
this, as Nvith ail other questions.
The Prime Minister also quoted Hon. Mr.
Ilanson, Leader of the Opposition, as saying:
That, primiarily, is the only issue involved.
Eiphati-ally. it is ot, iii this specific vote, an

issue for or agail)st t-oiulsory service for
overseas. It is irerey a vote to release or
refuse to relcaso. 'Ur. King froin a pro electioni
pledge.
And finally the Prime Minister quoted the
leader of tlic Canadian Co-operative Federa'ion,- as follows:
It
mieut

is a vote to release members of Parlis-

fromn their ptbedge not even to consider

surit eonscription.
Honourabie senators will remember the
solemn pledge given by Mr. Lapointe in his
own name and in the name of his Quehec
colloagues, with the acquioscence of the

Government, that conscription would nover
ho made law by a Government of which he
was a member.

because they said "No" when they 1ad the
right to say "No," and had been urged to
say "No" for so mýany years by the same people
who now wanted "Yes" for answer?
These peonle, who for years had put their
trust in Laurier, his lieutenant Lapointe, and
the present Minister, the people who followed
their leaders blindly, but faithfully, and who
were told up to the last minute that no
conscription would be imposed, could not
comprehend the stand of the Prime Minister
and lost confidence in him. If even an
astute man like Mr. Cardin found out too
late what the real meaning of the proposal
was, how could the average man find out,
except by instinct?
Why single out French Canadians for attack
when there is no conscription in the other
Dominions? Why call them traitors because
they used the right tu express their opinions?
If you want co-operation you should at
least state clearly what you want. The bonourable senator from Vancouver South (Hon.
Mr. Farris) stated last night that he was
pleased with the calmness of the discussion
in this Chamber. I agree with him. But is
it as calm elsewhere, in certain sections of
the Press, or in certain pulpits? For your
edification I will read from an article by
Mr. Grattan O'Leary in the magazine
"Liberty" for August 28, 1941. The article
is a year old now, but it seems to me it
applies with even more force to-day than it
did when it was written.
Why this eternal harping on Quebee? Harping that bas been-and is to-day-the curse
of Canadian politics? Why at this time, above
all, this implied proclamation to the worldand to Hitler-that if Canada adopted the
"all out" war method of conscription, the people
of Quebec, a fourth of our population, would
resist?
Isn't it about tine that Canadians who live
in Quebec should bc treated as other Canadians?
That they shouldn't be constantly held up and
dealt with as a race apart-as a nation within
a nation? Why should we have Mr. Ernest
Lapointe thanking Quebec, as Quebec, for its
contribution to the war loan? Isn't the implication that in some way Quebec's contribution
was extraordinary or unexpected?
That the
people there aren't as otler Canadians?
No Ontario Minister goes on the radio to
thank Ontario. No Nova Scotia Minister to
thank Nova Scotia. Whiy diffcrent treatment
for Quebec? Wly should Mr. Lapointe harp
constantly on "nmy race" and "my province"
and "ny people"? Isn't Quebec Canadian? A
part of the whole of Canada?
Yet year after year, and through this war,
this mischievous thing goes on. Talk of Quebec.
Talk of French Canadians. Maintained on the
one hand by politicians in Quebec who imagine
it politically profitable, on the other hand by
a few politicians who liate Quebec and think
it politically profitable.
The whole sordid
business is un-Canadian, un-British, treasonable
to Canada's life.
Hon. Mr. MARCOTTE.

I now come to the Bill. The Prime Minister
states:
A release from the moral obligation not to
resort to conscription for overseas service was
a necessary first step before Canada's war effort
could be placed in its true light.
What kind of light had we before? Who
was holding the candle?
Again, the Prime Minister says:
To claim that what had been sought or
obtained by the plebiscite was a mandate for
conscription is to assert that the plebiscite
was a mere subterfuge. Such a claim goes
further than that: it is equivalent te saying that
those who stated that the issue was not conscription, did net mean what they said; that
they were deliberately seeking to deceive the
electorate.
And again:
To-day, despite the magnificence of Canada's
war effort, the impression is being fostered
among other nations that because of a restriction on the powers of the Government, Canada's
war effort is not an all-out effort.
A restriction on the powers of the Government? Let us see what the Prime Minister
bas to say on that:
Up to the present, I have said nothing of the
powers which, under the War Measures Act,
the Governor in Couneil already possesses.
Under that Act, as interpreted by judicial
decision and by the legal advisers of the
Government, the Governor in Council bas
authority, notwithstanding section 3, to send
men enlisted under the National Resources
Mobilization Act te points outside the boundaries of Canada and the territorial waters
thereof. In other words, if, to-day, in the
opinion of the Government, the war situation
demanded the dispatch overseas of men already
called up under compulsion for military service,
the Governsent bas the necessary legal power
to order their dispatch.
The Prime Minister says that the plebiscite
was not a mandate. But what did be say on
the 25th of February and the 10th of June?
With reference to the specifie question of
enlistnent for service overseas, I said, on
February 25:
'Whin we find that wc cannot raise the
required numbers of men for enlistuient overseas

by the voluntary method, and it is absolutely
iecessary to raise more men by othier mxethods,
then we willii make our decision. present it te
Parliament and have if discussed on its mierits."
Unless the question of conscription for overseas service is to he twice debated, that, as I
see it, is the stage we have now reached.

If that stage bas been reached, it is because
the voluntary method bas failed. Still we are
assured that the voluntary method is at present sufficient-that conscription may never be
needed. Where is the truth?
The hcnourable senator from Rougemont
(Hon. Mr. Beauregard) stated yesterday that
the Militia Act could have been used. Personally I never could understand why it was

JULY 29, 1942
not used in 1917. The Act has been in force
since Confederation and was amended by
Laurier in 1904. It was the accepted iaw. It
is stili in existence. 1 wili read two of its
sections:
8: Ail the male inhabitants of Canada, of
the age of eightecn years and upwards, and
under sixty, not exempt or disqualified by iaw,
and being British subjects, shall be hiable to
service in the Militia: Provided that the
Governor Generai may require ail the maie
inhabitauts of Canada, capable of bearing arms,
ta serve in the case of a levée en masse.
64: The Governor in Council may place the
Militia, or any part thereof, on active service
anywhere in Canada, and aiso 'beyond Canada,
for the defence thereof, at any time when it
appears advisable so te do by reason of
emergency.
Have we at present a case of emnergency or
not? The answer is obvious.
The meaning of the words just quoted is
clear. "Levée en masse": that is conscription.
"Beyond Canada": that is service anywhere
when needed. To my mind the present BiH
does nlot give any new power to the Government. It simply cancels a moral obligation,
a pledge given by the Prime Minister to his
followers and to the country.
My main objection is that the Governinent
will act by Order in Co-uncil instead of bringing before Parliament not only the principle
of the measure, but also the details surrounding it. I cannot understand why the Prime
Minister, a deciared champion of the supreme
rights of Parliament, is discarding Parliarnent
on sucb an issue.
But the Government is in charge of the
war effort of Canada. That is ita responsibility ta the country. It .is in possession of
ail facts and circumstances. We want to
aefend Canada first. If for the needs of
that defence it becomes necessary to bave a
"levée en masse" and to have more men
beyond Canada, to j ain our Allies and assure
victory, it is the duty of every Canadýian not
to hamper that war effort. Sacrifices must
be made, politics forgotten, past and present
controversies put aside. In justice to the
minority I represent, I have to tell them
where their duty lies, no matter how unpleasant its fuifilment may be.
Outside wha-t we owe Canada, what we owe
the British Empire, aur Allies, we owe, 1
submnit, a special duty ta the American
people. Even before the war their President
promnised, in the namne of the United States,
that shouid Canada be attacked the American
nation would come ta the resdue. We owe
them the samne protection, and this means
sending our armed forces beyond Canada.
Let us unite, and let us make the necessary
sacrifices to win this war and secure peace.
God save our Kingl God save Canada!

Hon. R. B. HORNER: I think it might
not be out of place for honourable senators
to hear another voice fromn Saskatchewan. I
wish flrst of ail to compliment the honourable
senator from St. Albert (Hôn. Mr. Biais) on
bis very fine speech and the excellent manner
in which hie delivered it. The great city of
Edmonton, from which hie cornes, has something unique, a Moslem temple, it being the
oniy place of worship of that kind in the
whole Dominion. Coming from that Western
country, 1 think hie might have gone further
in his remarks urging a better understanding
between our two great races. I 'boo was
brought up in the province of Quebec. In
that part of the West where I have spent the
iast thirty-five years wili- be found men of
rnany nationalities. For example, our municipal counicil used to be composed of seven
men, of whom I was the oniy Engiish-speaking
member. It has been the aim, of my life to
endeavour to be toierant -to men of al
nationalities.
Hon. Mr. KING: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. HORNER: I think that before
this Bill is passed many of us ought perhaps
to express our views with respect to it. We
had considerabie discussion on the piebiscite
measure. I corne frorn the Prime Minister's
constituency, as honourabie members know,
and whiie I was opposed to the idea, once the
Plebiscite Bill was passed there was no word
of criticism frorn me. In fact I undertook,
with the defeated candidate, to look after the
voting in my riding, and 1 found myseif in
the position of defending the Prime Minister
and of being accused of having turned Liberai
entirely. I was, as the honourabie senator
from Ottawa said when speaking on this Bill,
manoeuvred into that position. I can understand the bewilderment of the honourabie
senator from Wellington (Hon. Mr. Howard)
as to whether we are fighting Conservatives
or the Japs. That is what we wonder at, too,
sometimes, and we shouid like the Liberai
party to attack the war effort with the saine
savagery-if I may use the term-as they do
anyone who rnight appear likely to become
leader of the Conservative party.
The honourable senator from Vancouver

It is, however, with respect to the state of
public opinion concerning our national status
th-at I wish particularly to speak to-day. Two
distinct aspects of our position in this war
are presented ta us by the Bill. One of thern
has ta do with the question of rnan-power and
the more effective techaical prosecution of
the war; in short, with the whole practical
job of administration in the field of war. The
ather is related, broadly speakîng, ta the
political situation in this country underlying
all activities pertaining ta the war. It is the
second of these aspects I wish ta discuss this

is in effeet an admission of mistakes that have
been made in the past in the naine of partisan
polities. I arn glad ta notice that headlines
in the paper this morning proclairned the news
that aur debate bas cut directly scross party
limes. The rnistakes which are being tacitly
adrnitted in this Bill are not the legacy of any
ane party, sud I do not intend ta pursue the
long, futile and barren trail of party recrirnination at this tirne in an attcrnpt ta fix
responsibility for the beginning of these mistakes. The fact is, I arn sure, that in the
mind of every member of this House there
is a distinct conviction that mistakes cavering the past thirty-fivc ycars have been made
in connection with statements and pledges
uttered in the province of Quebec duringthe course of election campaigns, and that
they arc not the responsibility of any anc
psrty or any anc individual.
Thc unfortunate result of these sins of
partisanship is that their effeet upon public
opinion, not only in Quebec, but in other
provinces as well, bas been cumulative, and
naw, in this hour of dire necd, we have in
Canada a messure of disunity and are dissipating energy and spirit which should. be dirccted
ta aur cammon national task.
I say this by way of introduction ta rny
subjeet, because I iihauld like ta sec an end
ta this era of self-destructive partîsanship, and
a period of decent political thinking and
talking reintroduced in Canada. No finer
national mernarial could be established in this
annivcrsary year of Confederation than ta
mark the mernorable occasion of this debate
in Parliament with the beginning of such a

period in aur histary. Let us resolve, for one
thing, that neyer again shall Quebec be used
as a pawn on thc great international chessboard of war and peace in order ta serve
pahitical ends in this country.
Sorne Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: To those whose
strang sud bitter feelings at this tirne are
incliaed ta find expression in acrirnoniaus
wards-and anc is glad ta observe that few
of thern have been uttcred in this debate in
Parliament-the imperishable hunes frorn ane
of St. Paul's epistles should rnake good rcading. I should like ta recitc them:
For ail the law is fulflled ini ane word, even
in this, Thou shait lave thy neighbour as
thyseif. But, if ye bite andI devour ane
another, take heed that ye hie not consunîei
ane of another.

I arn grateful ta my hanourable friend and
colleague from Ottawa for having placed an
the record yestcrday quatations frorn the
utterances of the honourable the Minister of
Justice and the late Lord Tweedsrnuir, because
they contain the central thought and ides, of
what I want ta say. Indced, I might quite
appropriatcly take thc marnarable declaration
af Lard Tweedsmuir as the text for my
rernarks ta-day.

For a long tîme much seriaus sud patriotie
thought bas been devotcd by an increasing
number of Canadians ta the subjeet of their
national status; but thcy have not been
articulate enough, they have not been militant
euough; consequentlyý their point of view bas
not heen adequately represented in Parliarnt
or in the gavernent of Canada.
May I say at this point, with aIl deference
ta rny fellow-Canadian friends of the province
of Quebec, that I arn quite williug ta concede
ta thern their historie position of long establishment on the soul of this country, even ta
the point of designating thern as an aristocracy
in the Canadian farnily. But I should deprecate on that account auy tendency tawards
an aloofness or a kind of class distinction in
relation ta those resident in the other provinces, who, like rnyself, also have a very
definite attachment ta the soil of this country.
We want only anc standard of loyalty sud
attachment ta Canada, rcgardlcss of geagraphy,
race, or auything cisc.
Some Han. SENATORS: Hear, haer.
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: Just here I should
like ta psy tribute, in words which I know
are inadequate, ta the great contribution
which bas been made ta the life of this
Dominion hy the people cf Quebec. To our
relatively srnall but preciaus store of art,
literature and music they have gîven much

SENATE

treasure.
Our cultural heritage is vastly
richer because of thoir presence amongst us,
and I am expressing heartfelt sentiments when
I say that the potentiality of our national
future will depend upon the continued gifts
which they can bestow upon our citizenship.
The time bas come for those who believe in
the existence of a Canadian nation to stand
up and say so in no uncertain tone. Let us
find out in this time of heart searching and
intellectual reasoning if insuperable obstacles
stand in the way of real Canadian nationhood;
and if so, let us be honest enough to identify
them and face them.
In this seventy-fifth anniversary year of
Confederation, as I read the declarations of our
fathers, so eloquently expressed in the days
preceding our birth, and try to interpret the
faith that was in them, I am inclined to think
that we have fallen far below the national
standards and objectives which they had in
mind.
Let me quote briefly from some of the outstanding statements of those great men. Sir
George Etienne Cartier, who was Macdonald's
lieutenant from Quebec in the Confederation
period, said:
Shall w-e be content to maintain a mere
provincial
existence,
when by
combining
together we could become a great nation? . . .
Objection bas been taken to the schene now
under consideration becauîse of the words, New
Nationality. Now, wlien we are united, if
union be attained. we shall forn a political
nationality with which neither the National
origin, nor the religion of any individual will
interfere.
Macdonald himself said:
One of the great advantages of Confederation
is that we shall have a united, a concentrated
and uniiform systei of defence-and be one
people acting alike in peace and war.
Thomas D'Arcy MecGee, whose poetic eloquence made him an outstanding advocate of
Confederation as the groundwork of a new
nation, said:
I hope to sec the day when there will be no
other tern for our patriotism but Canadian
without the prefix, either French, or English.
Alexander Galt, said:
Half a continent is ours, if we do not keep
on quarrelling about petty matters and lose
siglt of what interests us inost.
George Brown, who is given credit for
having first mentioned Confederation, said:
A federal union cannot be considered for
Canada alone, but must include all British
America.
The great Joseph Howe, from Nova Scotia,
declared:
Out of this discussion may arise a spirit that
may lead North America to cast aside ber
colonial habiliments, te put on national aspects.
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT.

And Charles Tupper, also from Nova Scotia,
said:
At great international conferences, Canada
takes her place side by side with other powers
upon equal terms.
Finally, it was Samuel Tilley from New
Brunswick who described the new federation
in the Scriptural words:
He shall bve Dominion from sea to sea and
from the river unto the ends of the earth.
The acid test of any nation's status comes
when it bas to deal with matters of peace and
war. Those were the subjects which concerned
the minds of the men who made Confederation. How have we dealt with them since that
time? By slipping as easily as possible between Imperialist sentiment on the one hand
and an entirely isolationist position on the
other. And this bas been done, in the final
analysis, by permitting our fortunes in war
and in peace to be determined for us by a
Minister of Foreign Affairs living two
thousand miles away, a member of a Government over which we have no control whatsoever.
Technically, when it comes to a
showdown, as it did in September, 1939, we
can say that Canada declared war by the vote
of ber own Parliament and entered the lists
at the side of Britain as a free nation; but
actually and realistically, apart from the
parliamentary procedure involved, Canada
committed herself in this war without a due
understanding or appreciation of all that was
involved in it, including the underlying
causes and policies which led up to it.
I like to say, and to think, that the
Canadians who are taking part in the present
war, regardless of where they are, have only
one thought, namely the defence of Canada.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE:

Nothing else?

Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: But we have the
spectacle to-day in this Dominion of a large
section of our population placing a definite
limitation upon that point of view. Why?
in my opinion it is because up to now the
matter of the defence of Canada, the position
of Canada as a nation in this world, if you
like, bas not been faced realistically. It bas
not been faced realistically because our
Governments and our people have been content, evidently, to concern themselves in the
main with all the domestic politics of an
internal physical development, and have left
questions of international relationships te the
more or less unknown channels running fron
our Department of External Affairs in Ottawa
to London and Washington. We have been
content with our own geographical position
of seeming security in North America, on the

JIILY 29, 1942
one hand, and with our dependence on
Downing Street and the British Navy, on the
other hand.
The point I wish to make is that we should
cease vain ta.lk about the status of nationhoud, and admit that we do nut possess the
full measure of responsible government befitting a nation; or do something actually to
establish our pretensions on a basis of reasonable representation in an international
sphere, the direction of which we have chosen
ini the past to leave largely to others.
I know that the signing of the Peace Treaty
at the end of the last war and the subsequent
provisions of the Statute of Westminster
theoretically placed Canada on an equal footing with any other part of the Empire, which
because of that fact became a "Commonwealth
of Nations." But in se far as the outlook of
the elec tors in the different provinces and
constituencies of Canada bas been concerned,
in relation to 'decisions on matters of peace
and war, the responsibilities consistent with
national status have not been brought home
to them at any time.
We are in the war now, however. No doubt
exists about thut fact. Its all-enveloping
character bas begun to crystallize something
more real in the way of a Canadian position
in the world than was possible even in 1939.
Present indications suggest that before the end
of this war is in sigbt Canada's position as a
national entity will be still more clearly outlined in the minds of hier people. To hring
this thought home, consider the possibiiity of
the ending of thýis war. We were in it at the
start, professedly at the side of Britain. Some
people say now that we are engaged in the
defence of Canada anywhere in the world.
However, since the beginning of the war another pantner bas taken up arms at our side,
namcely, the United States of America. We
may wcll 'be tbankful for that partnership.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, h par.
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: One notices many
evidences, however, of the increasing weight
and influence of our powerful American ally in
the prescnt world picture. T-here is no need
to enumerate them. London goes to Washington; Mr. Churchill says that is where things
are being done. Canada also goes to Washington, if she is invited by the President of
the United States. Will the fact that Canada
entered this war-as a free people making their
decision through a representative and free
Parliament-two years hefore tihe United
States entered it, ensure us a part and a voice
cornmensurate with that position, when the
time comes'for reconstructing a new world?

359

That fact will not stand for mucb to others
if it does flot stand for much to us. Over
against the background of a history wbicli has
been largely a record of great aspirations on
the part of a gradually increasing population,
scattered over a wide domain in isolated pockets, we are now condronted with a test of
strength and capacity which in the end will
qualify or disqualify us for real dlaims of
national citizenship.
The recent plebiscite has been described as
an X-ray plate setting up a picture of Canada
before our eyes in a way that eould not have
been done in any other manner. If that be
so and the picture is a real one, I am, afraid
it reveals some fractures in the body politie
at this time. Possibly it is just as well to
have them revealed; because if they are not
set and healed properly at this late date, the
danger of permanent erippling and dismemberment is surely very real indeed. To exert the
fuilest possible measure of united strengtb now
in resisting and overcoming the overshadowing menace to Canada and bier Allies, is an
immediate and vital need in so fan as the outcome of the present wonld conflict is concerned.
It becomes an even greater need in the light
of hopes and daims for a full national existence in the future.
It is because of these uncertaînties, because
clearer answers are requircd from our governments in these matters, and because I, for
one,' want to look forward to something cleaneut and definite in the way of a national
existence for the people who inhabit the
northern haîf of this continent, that I am in
favour of clause 3 being withdrawn from the
Mohilization Act as quickly as possible.
Hon. F. B. BLACK: Honourable senators,
I was ready to make some remarks on Bill 80,
but I told my honourable leader (Hon. Mr.
Ballantyne) that I would not speak unless
I felt there was a real reason for doing 80.
Mfter baving heard the debate thus far, wbich
bas been a most enlightening and pleasant
experience for me, as I feel sure it bas been
for nîl bonourable members, I do not intend to
make the remarks I was prepared to make if
occasion arose. I am very much pleased that
in this debate nothing, or almost nothing, bas
been said to whicb any of us could take
reasonable objection, and I do flot wish to
introduce any discordant note. My chief
desire, wbich I am sure is tbe chief desire of
every honourable member of either House
and, I hope, of everyone in Canada, is that
Canada shaîl do its utmost to win the war.
That is our first duty, and, as I conceive it,
our only diuty, at this time.
I think 1 should not have risen at all in
this debate but for the fact that I did not

3w0

SENATE

quite comprehiend the rcrnark of the honourable senator from Ottawa (Han. Mr. Lambert),
who bas .iust spoken so eloquentiy, in whieh hie
said in effect that our only interest is in Canada. True, aur first interest is in Canada. I
should like to hear the honourabie gentleman
explin bis point a littIe more fully. It is ta
our interest to save Canada, and in doing Sa it
is also to, our interest to save our British
connection and the British Empire.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: flear, hear.
Hon. Mr. BLACK: I shouid have ]ikcd my
honourable friend ta couple with bis remarks
a statement of the fact that we enjay the
favourable position which we do in Canada
because of the British Empire. We have
looked ta and depended upan the British
Empire for guidance, and 1 for anc hope I
shall fot live ta sec the day when there is
any severance between Canada and the British
Empire. Whenever in our history Canada lias
been able ta take a step forward, she bas been
encouragcd by Downing Street ta do so. If
we have independcnce-and we have-it is
becauise of Downing Strcct's desire that we
should have it rather than of any demand wa
made upon Downing Street.
I for anc hope that aur position in the
British Empire will be rnaintained throughout
My ]ife and the ]ives of my children and
grandebjîdren. for ta nie Canada and the
Empire are bound up indivisibly. If this
country is ta make any progress it must be
made hand in hand with the British Empire.
I do not visualize, I do not want ta visualize,
the separation of Canada from the Empire.
I prefer ta visiialize a tirnie whcen we shall
be living in anc political organization with
1
the rcst of the membersý of the British Comnmonwealthi and aur great neighbour ta the
south of uis. I think we may reasonably look
forward ta that, and not to (lisintegration of
the Empire.
While I arn an my fecd I want ta say that
the tenor of the speeches in the debate would
indicate that aur diilerenccs-which, after al,
are on oniy anc 1Point-are perhaps the result
of a misconception, and that this can be
straightened out if we and ail the people of
the varions provinces determine not ta accentuate aur respective viewpaînts, but ta do al
we can ta bring Qucbec and Ontario, New
Brunswick and Nova Scotia and ail the other
provinces into dloser harmony with anc
another. If we proeeed aiong that line wc
shaîl soon have no people rcferrcd ta as
French Canadians and English Canadians. I
deprecate 'the use of these expressions. W~e
are aIl Canadians.
Hon. Mr. DAVID: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. BLACK.

Hon. Mr. BLACK: Do not let us caîl any
of aur fcllow citizens French Canadians. I
(Io not refer ta myseif as an English or Scotch
Canadian. We are ail alike Canadians. We
love aur country. Let us serve it honestly
and well.
Hon. J. A. CALDER: Ilonourable senatars,
I had not intended ta say anything in this
(lebate, because for rny reamons I did not
deeni it necessary ta do so.
It may be said, and I thiuik truthfuliy, that,
Canada from coast ta caast lias had ample
opportunity, and, bias taken advantage of it.
ta consider and decide the merits of the question now before us. 1 doulit very muchi
whether I could add anything in any sense
useful to the debate. A decision bas heen
reached, and niow there is nothing to do but
give the Government the authority it nceds.
Nothing is ta be gained by going aver ail these
past differences of opinion.
If there is anc tb.ing I arn delighted with
to-day it is the temper of the discussion in
týhis Chamber on the Bill. We have a very
unfortunate situation in Canada at the prescnt
time. WVe aIl admit aur people are divided.
and that everything shauld be donc that can
bc donc to put an end ta that disunity. I
hav e m-y view, you have yours, as ta what
is the real basis for this difference of opinion.
In my judgment it shauid neyer have existcd
at ahl. I do hope that ail leaders in this
country, quite apart from any political considerations whatever, will do evcrything in
thieir power fromn now on ta sec that that
disunity is I)roughit ta ani end and nat stirred
up again.
Oaa of my great difficuties-and the same
ivas truc back in 1917, wlhcn I became a muember of the Gaveroment of that day-is how
people differ in opinion at ail] on the anc
question that divides thers to-day. Let us
look at the situation an the IOth of September, 1939, when we declared war against
Germany. I shall fot follow the argument
advanced by my honourabie friend from
Ottawa (Hon. Mr. Lambert), but I say Parliament, did know, or should have known,
exactly what it was doing. Parliament, speaking for the nation, declarcd war. What dues
war mean? It means flghting. Who lias ta
do the fighting? Is it ta 'be Icft ta the choice
of the individual? If a mistake was made in
declaring war, that is an entirely different
thing. If, when the British Government years
ago decided ta carry on a war in South Africa,
the people of Canada took the view that
some take now, I should not have objected.

JULY 29, 1942
But Canada itself is attacked; not necescarily on our shores. Everybody admita that
it is only a question of time before the
avalanche will reach us.
1 do not like the word "conscription" at
all. I agree with ail that has been said about
the necessity for food, munitions, and ail
kinds of services, but we 6hould have a compulsory selective service law under which the
State is at liberty to cail any and every man
for the service hie is best qualified to perform.
That is our duty as citizens. I do not care
where we live, what our forefathers were,
what religion we profess, or what language
we speak-we are ail Canadians, and it seems
to me that when our country declares war
ngainst an enemy we ought to give that fact
proper consideration and come to only one
,conclusion: that it is the duty of every
citizen to hold himèelf ready for any service
that the State may cail upon him to undertake.
I shall vote for the Bill. When it is passed
the Government will have a free band. I
do not agree at ail with the view that the
necessity for conscription doca not exist.
There was neyer greater necessity in the world
to get men ready for the struggle that is
bound te come. before this war is finished.
You cannot prepare men for active service
in a week or month; it cannot be done. We
should nlot wait any longer. The war is right
at our door-step now. If we give to the.
Government the powers called for by this
measure, it will at ieast be in a position to
act when it thinks the time is ripe. I repeat,
I intend to vote for the Bill.
Hon. JOIIN T. HAIG: Honourable senators,
1 want to make my position perfectly clear.
1 would not vote for this Bill at ail if I
thought an affirmative vote would be construed in Quebec or in any other province of
Canada as an attempt by the majority to make
the minority do something that in their con.science they think ought not to be done. I
have been particularly impressed iby three
speeches fromn the other side of the Huse,
one hy the honourabie member from Rougemont (Hon. Mr. Beauregard), the other by the
honourable member fromn DeSalaberry (Hon.
Mr. Gouin), and the third by the member
from St. Albert (Hon. Mr. Biais). They
brought home to me the seriousness of the
situation. I do not know *how other sections
of Canada feel, but 1 know the attitude of
honourable members from the four Western
Provinces. The people living by the sea, in
the mountains or on the prairies have no
desire to make our feilow-Canadians do something that they in their conscience think ought
not to be donc.

361*

Conscription has assumed a rather ugly
meaning. I do not agree with -the statement
of the honourable member from Ottawa (Hon.
Mr. Lambert) that we were not fully aware
of the meaning of our action ini entering t.his
war. When, in September, 1939, 1 for one
stood up in this House and voted for a.
declaration of war against Germany, I knew
what I was doing. Make no mistake about it.
I was ordering my boy to the front. I did nlot
vote because Anthony Eden or Lord Halifax
said something. I voted because I knew in
my own conscience that if Hitler won in
Europe we should be the next victim on the
Order Paper. Those of us who have boys in
the forces, especialiy if they are in suicide
squads, where they have one chance in a
hundred of coming back, do not need anybody -te tell us what conscription means. We
know what it means. It means, not conscription of law, but conscription of duty. We do
not want our boys to go into that fight and
be killed any more than we want anybody
else's boys to die for their country.
I did not like the iast part, but I did the
opening part of the speech of the honourable
senator from Vancouver South (Hon. Mr.
Farris), where hie said that we stand in the
shadow of one of the greatest moments in the
world's history. We know that if Hitler,
Mussolini and Hirohito win this war it means
the end of our civilization for 1,000, maybe
2,000 years.
I want my fellow-citizens fromn Quebec,
Ontario, Manitoba, or any other province who
happen to speak the French language-I wish
I didSome Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: -I want themn to understand that by our vote we do not intend to
say to them: "We are trying to make you do
something you do nlot want to do". We, are
voting for this Bill because we believe under
Divine Providence it is our duty to face the
greatest crisis in the history of the world.

JULY 29, 1942
Is my honourable
Hon. Mr. SAUVE:
frienci seeking an excuse or an apology for
bis conduct?
Hon. Mr. DAVID: In what?
Hlon. Mr. SAUVE: In what he is read.ing?
Hon. Mr. DAVID.- No, not at alI. I want
to eatablish that they are wrong who contend
that once the majority bas spoken upon any
question the minority should remain silent.
I say it with a pride that I do not try to
conceal, bonourable senators, that for twenty
years and more in the province of Quebeo and
ail the other provinces, I have given expression to the truth, as I saw it, with the one
desire of tryîng to brîng about a bonne
entente, a better understanding, between the
different parts of our country. I have always
thought and said that it will be impossible to
have Canadian unity as long as the cîtizens
of our country do not regard tbemselves as
Canadians, first, last and always. I do not
for one moment blame a man who cornes frorn
Scotland, Ireland or England for being proud
of hîs country of origin, but I contend, and
I think 1 arn not far wrong in this, that
every rnan-regardless of where he or bis
father or grandfather was born-who earns
his living or brings up a farnily in this
country, bas the duty of becoming a real
Canadian citizen. I say that at all times, in
peace or war, in periods of crisis or tranquillity, wjth regard to all questions affecting this
country lie sbould ha a Canadian in bis mind,
in bis heart and in bis soul.
In spite of the present disunity in the
country, 1 bave faitb iu the future of Canada.
For a few moments I shaîl try to follow in the
steps of the honourable senator frorn Ottawa
(Hon. Mr. Lambert) in stating frankly and
candidly my bopes with respect to the future.
Is it disloyalty to England to say that a
colony cannot permanently rernain at a certain stage, that it can neyer be at anything
more tban a stage of transition in the 111e of
its people, transition from infancy to manhood among nations? Wboever consulte bistory on this point will see that rare indeed
are the countries that have resisted this
universal law. In the far-off days of history
the colonies of Phoenîcia and Greeca proved
this bistorical truth, and in modem tirnes the
United States, Mexico and Brazil have also
dernonstrated it. Animated by this supreme
thought that we shahl follow this universal
haw, and that one day we shaîl graduate frorn
the rank of colony to the rank of one of the
free nations of the world, sbould we not prepare for developing our future as we tbink
it should be developed? I believe our country bas at this tirne tbe riglit to look forward
44567-24à

M

to the fullest possible measure of autonomy,
and that in the future we shall become a free,
independent and equal nation. We must neyer
forget that we are living history, which those
wbo corne after us wrnl write. They wrnl be
able impartially to relate our actions and
comment on our words. They will bless or
curse us according to whether we do or fail
to do our duty as pointed out to us by the
inner voice of national conscience.
It seems to me that it is only rendering
justice to those who brought about Confederation to say that it was the hope of the
mai ority of themn by this centralization of
power to develop harmony, peace, and concord between the Atlantic provinces and the
provinces of Quebec, Ontario and the West,
tbat these, united by a single ambition and a
single commercial interest, might join their
efforts to bring about the greatest possible
measure of industrial, commercial and intellectual develo'pment. Further, their declaration as regards the perfect auto'nomy that
our country was to enjoy, which tbey said was
determined by the very text of the Constitution, satisfied the aspirations of those wbo
placed the interest of Canada above everything. For these, between this satisfaction
and thbe realization of their aim to become a
nation enjoying perfect political and national
autonomy, there was only the distance that
separates an evident conclusion from a wellpropounded premise.
It must be admitted that these were reamons
sufficient te compel the men of that tine, to
wish for this union; or, after having refused
it, to accept it when it was decided upon. It
was an effort not only to foster harmony
and concord, but also to bring about the
development of a Canadian mentality, that
wvas attempted in 1867 by the statesmen who
drew up, proposed and put through Confederation. They had on their side this argument, that the union of Quebec and Ontario
had becomie intolerable from the political
standpoint, owing to the instability of the
governments and the continual agitation in
which the two provinces found themeselves.
Thus, after having fought with a vigour and
perseverance that we must admire, Dorion
and his friends, the opponents of this project,
when they found themselves defeated, that
is to say, when in spite of their opposition
the pact had beeu signed, believing that the
lot of the vanquished in polities as well as
in war was to make the best of the position
created by the change, endeavoured with
admirable moderation and tolerance to preserve the sympathy and goodwill of those

~364

SENATE

who, though making up the majority, yet in no
manner begrudged the French Canadian
minority its righ-ts, but entertained for it a
profound respect and a sincere sympathy.
Far be it from me to think of citing the
period that followed the adoption of the
British North America Act as a period free
from any conflict or difficulty between the
province of Quebec and the other provinces
of Confederation; but 1 arn pleased to draw
from the history of the last seventy-five
years the conclusion that the problemns which
arose and agitated our coun.try in the first
twenty years took on a purely Canadian
character, and if sometimes, too often, alas,
for us, religious or political fanaticism showed
itself, ail attachment and sympathy had flot
disappeared when ealm was re-establisbed.
Thiat was the period when a group of statesmen representing our race gave it power and
prestige. It was also the period whea the
English provinces wcre represented by men
best able to understand our state of mind
and to judge it. So the understanding betwcen thcm was easy. for in the higli sphcrcs
of intellectuality, as in those of science and
philosophy, fricndships are easily created, and
sympathies as easily born.
Unfortunately these poli tico-rcligious probleims arose too oftc.n in our country. Let no0
one, I pray, take this declaration as a condimnation of those who were the cause of
this f.act, but let it be taken only as a mere
statement that in their periodical recurrence
we shall find the germ of prejudice. the germ
of a union against us of the Englislî majorities
in the other provinces.
What has saved us up to to-day is Iliat at
every crisis men w'ho did not share our
religious beliefs, who wcre not of our origin,
wcre willing to flght cii our side for the principles which we wishcd to prevail, for the
liberties we wished to have respected. Unhappily the number of these friendships
diminished in proportion to the frequency of
the problems, and slowly, insensibly, for a
political purpose, there was ereated this perverse, fatal doctrine, catise of the distinion
that exists to day, that we wishcd to afflrm
French domination in this country. What
error! what absurdity!
Why had we for
sevcnty-five years, in order to avoid national
ýcrises, to accept compromises, conelude ententes, abandon fragments of our rights, only
to arrive at such a result, such a doctrine?

It seems to me thiat we never affirmed any-

thing but our righit to certain privileges, the
granting of w'hichi we have for a long time
attributed to the generosity of our Englishi
11,,n. Mr. DAVID.

compatriots; and for this, England, British
institutions and our English compatriots had
no more sincere and frank admirers than the
Canadians of Quebec.
I still believe, in spite of the immense wave
which seems to menace our country, and which

for nearly twenty years was kept in check
by a man in whom history will recog-nize a
wisdom that his contemporaries often failed to
see, even taking it for a desertion of his principles-I believe, 1 say, that the wave will
pass, and that the reaction caused by its
passing will revive in the provinces from

whichi it is useless to-day to ask any caIm or
collected thought, a great desire to mould once
more in oîir country a mentality in keeping
with its aspirations and destiny.
It has been charged that we care nothing
for the flag of England. They have gone so
far as to deelare in certain quarters that we
have no respect, Do loyaltv for it. Will you
permit. me, honourable senators, to reply in
ail frankncss te tlîis statenient, wIîicl they
have bce plcased to repeat se that little by
lit tic tiiere mnight bc created the impression
that we on the banks of the St. Lawrence are
a greup ef rc~w
ho wait but the moment
to take up arms?
To the flag of England we accord the most
complcte, the most absolute loyalty and the
miost sincere respect; for it is a duty, and I
do not know that a people, even a conquered
people, ever vulatl tflie flag of the conqueror

if in its folds it found the liberty it dcsired, the
assured guarantees and privileges accorded by

the treatv under whieh it submitted. But to
makze it a duty of a conquercd people to love

the flag of the conqueror scems to me to in-

dicate a poor understanding of the buman
soul. Loyalty is a duty; love is a sentiment.
If loyalty comnmands nic. the other comes of
itself. Lt cannot he forced. It can be attracted
by virtue of goodwill, of sympathy; but neyer
by insulting those upon whom it is imposed
can this love be elicited from them. Let me
not bc nistinderstood, 1 pray, in the statements I have iust made. Far be it from me
to say that we have not to-day as much as in
the past a reasoned attachmcnt for the British
flag, not because it is the flng cf England,
but bccause to us it represents British institutions, whieh, whatever may be said of the
inen who administer and refleet them, remain
the model of human parliamentary institutions.
Wlîile 1 do flot pretend to înteî'pret the
opinion of cuir IEnglish coinpatriots, I (I0 not
fear to declare that thiere are still many among
them who believe that Imperialism is a danger,
who do flot accept it, and will accept it still
less to-morrow, but who for the moment,

JULY 29, 1942
carried away, some of them, by a sincere and
ardent patriotism, consider it their duty ta &id
the Empire in every possible way so that it
may flot meet a defeat or a setback ini the
present conflict. To such as these we must
bow. They may, from our point of view, lose
touch with our mentality. But can we reproach them for preserving a sincere love for
the country of their origin?
For them, their native land is not Canada.
Their home is across the sea, in same mountain
of Scotland or town of England that they
hope to see once more, and where they have
preserved their closest bonds. To us, whereever we live, whether on the coast of Gaspé
or in the Laurentides, whether on the banks
of the St. Lawrence or in some humble village
far from the cities, our native land is the
country in which our forefathers have lived
Mor 300 years, the country where our little
children were born. Our sole ambition, our
only hope, oui supreme ideal, is to assure the
greatness of this country.
The European peace, which, we continue
to hope in Rpite of everything, will re-establish world equilibrium, must, we think, have
its reaction among us. Ahl countries, great
and small, strong and weak, must in the afterwar period examine the ruins cau.sed by the
conflict. Love of native land, 'be that land
great or small, wherever it exists, will inspire
in individuals a national will and energy which
will enable them to surmount every difficulty,
and will unite them in the supreme determination to restore in its material formn their
native land as it was before the war.
Why not hope that the same love will inspire the same national energy in the moral
order and bring together the individuals of
certain countries whom the war had estranged
from one another, as a result of a different
comprehension of the same idea of duty to the
fatherland? Then there will be but one
question, one aim, one idea, that ail can
accept as a vivifying and national necessitythat of restoring among the individuals of the
samne country peace, harmony and good understanding.
That is why I say to you hopefully, with
Wickham Steed:
We must now look towards the future, and
not, with regret of heart, towards the past.
We must look towards the dawn ta see the
moment when the sun is ta appear, and not
think of the suns that have already set.
I look towards the dawn with ail my love
for the Canadian land. I look at this dawn
with aIl the strength of my enthusiasm, because I believe the day is not so far off as we
think when the sun, whose rays are necessary
ta warm once more the Canadian sou, will rise
at Iast over our poor country, torm, divided.

su5

We must not despair of the sun of to-morrow.
It will be the sun of liberty in the world, that
will cause rights and the reciprocal obligations
of nations to be respected; the sun that will
warm once again the enthusiasm. of individuals; the sun whose new splendor will make us
forget these last days of national anguish; and,
comforting ail souls once more, it will renewthe bond of tradition by uniting hearts andi
wills in a common effort. Then there will go
up ta the highest of the eternal vaults, fromu
aIl Canadian homes, a Te Deum of joy intoned by an entire nation at last conscious of
its strength, a nation that, spreading wide its
wings, can face the future without dread. The
Canadian nation wîll have risen. The Canadian soul will make it live; the Canadian ideal
wiIl guide it.
I feel that this optirnism will surprise a
great many of my compatriots who stop to
consider the harm that blind fanaticism has
done in aur country, and who cannot believe
that it is possible to retain any hope. Wi1l
they permit me, those who think in that,
fashion because they have suffered greatly,
who are made skeptical through this suffering,
who are pleased to cherish that suffering and'
keep it alive with sad memories, will they
permit me ta say that suffering is a sign,
and marks a line of conduct for those whoma
it gathers in, and whom it causes ta think?
As we are, we have suffered insuIt and worse.
Ail of us have bent ta the storm; we have
ail felt the force of the blast; and the shock
has kept alive within us aur national
susceptibiiity.
Weil, in spite of aIl that, I am an optimist.
I believe in the future of Canada, and I believe in the possibility of a Canadian mentality, because for these many questions we
have asked ourselves ane reply has sufficeda reply that is an affirmation of national faith,
a political ereed, a hope for the future. la
the generai madness we must have preserved
aur calin, we must have remained profoundly
Canadian ta have withstood this shock ancl
still to-day be capable of resistance.
Our position must have been very strong
and very logical when those who deemed aur
demands and aur attitude antipatriotic had
nothing ta offer as arguments but insults and
worse. If we bave logic on aur side, and if
our individual and national conscience dictated
what we believe ta have been a duty, and il,
seeing this duty, we performed it, trusting that
we should save aur country from the ruixt
towards which extravagant the aries were
impelling it, have I not the right ta hope that,
under the impulse of ýthis same logic, it wilI
some day be said that after ail we were not
wrong? And do you not think with me,

SENATE
honourable senators, that, once it is admitted
we are right, we shall be able to congratulate
ourselves on having prepared, the resurrection
of the Canadian Soul?
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: The question,
honourable senators, is on the third reading
of the Bill.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: Carried, on the
sane division.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was
read the third time, and passed.
PRESENTATION TO SENATE LEADERS
Hon. A. C. HARDY: Before you call it six
o'clock, Mr. Speaker, may I ask your permission, and that of the Senate, to have a very
few moments to carry out a very pleasurable
duty which I have been asked to perform?
My remarks will be brief, for the hour is late.
The Senate of Canada finds itself, for the
first time, I think, since Confederation, with
two new leaders in the same session. The
positions of the Government leader and the
Opposition leader in the Senate are not only
honourable, but also onerous, and our honourable friends have accepted these positions at
no small sacrifice of their business interests
and of those leisure hours to which they are
properly entitled.
We have just finished our debate on a
question that from coast to coast has aroused
strong opinions and in some quarters deep
feeling. I think that the high level on which
the debate has been conducted, and the fine
temper displayed by every speaker, have been
due in 0nosmall degree to the moderation and
good example of our two leaders and the way
in which they have controlled the situation
in general.
Since their appointients our honourable
friends have proved very successful leaders.
Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. HARDY: They have co-operated
with the rest of us to such an extent that I
believe tlere never was a kindlier spirit
prevailing throughout this House than at
present.
It is now my pleasure to present a littie
souvenir to eacli of our leaders as a token of
our appreciation of the services be lias rendered at this session.
The souvenirs are
identical, and I may say that they were not
purchased through party contribution. Whatever any honourable senator did in this matter
was done for both our leaders. It is the wish
Hon. Mr. DAVID.

of us all that the lives of both our leaders

may be long and happy, and not soon pass
away like the smoke which the souvenirs are
supposed to produce.

Hon. A. D. McRAE: Honourable senators,
it is a great privilege and pleasure to associate
myself and the friends on both sides of the

House

with the honourable

senator

from

Leeds (Hon. Mr. Hardy) in expressing ta our
new leaders our complete satisfaction with the
manner in which they have fulfilled their
responsible duties in this the first session of
their appointments. The present high level

of the debates in this House is, I am sure, in
no small degree due to their friendly influence,
and in keeping with the standard for which
this honourable Chamber is so well known. I
think we all appreciate that neither of these
honourable gentlemen wanted the position he
now occupies. They were compelled to accept
tliese positions by their high sense of public
duty and service. It is a great satisfaction to
the rest of us, as it must be to them, to know
that they have donc so well, and that there
is so kindly a feeling towards them on the
part of all honourable members. The little
gifts that we have presented then are but
tokens of our appreciation of their sacrifices
and of their excellent leadership in this
Chamber.
Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. J.
. KING: Honourable senators,
I feel somewhat overcome by the kind expresions to which I Lave just listened and
the beautiful gift that has been prnesented to
me. I can assure you that your words and
the gift will be highly prized by me throughout flic remainder of my life. It has been
a great pleasure and bonour to have had the
privilege of serving for a period of time as
leader on this side of the House. No man
could fall into better company than we have
here.
The co-operation and friendly spirit
extended to me have been dueply appreciatcd,
and I wish to take advantage of this opportunity te express that appreciation to each
and everv one of you. I can only add at this
time that I thank you all for the lindncss
which prompted this presentation.
Hon. C. C. BALLANTYNE: Hon. Senator
Hardy, Hon,. Senator McRae, and allh other
honourable members of this Chamber, I must
confess this bas been, a complete surprise.
Not an inkling of it had reachcd me. Like the
honourable leader of the Government (Hon.
Mr. King), I want te thank you from the
bottom of my beart.

The

major

credit for the

tolerant

and

temperate debate on this difficult Bill, probably one of the most important that have

JULY 29, 1942
ever corne before Parliament, is due to the
honourable leader opposite. He introduced
the Bill with ,such adm~irable restraint and
moderation of argument that he gave the
lead, nlot only to me, but to ail senators who
followed bim in the debate. This made the
path very much easier for us ahl.
I have felt since I have been occupying
this position that honourable senators, not oly
on this side but also on the other, would
notice the disparity between, my leadership
and that oi my distinguished predecessor.
You have comforted me very much by the
kindly presentation of this beautiful gif t, and
no leader on either side could desire anything more than such tangible evidence of
your goodwill. I appreciate it very bighly.
(Honourable senators then sang "For Tbey
Are Jolly Good Fellows," and gave the two
leaders three cheers and a tiger.)
At 6 o'elock the Senate took reoess.

367

The Bouse af Commons abjects ta this
amendment, I understand, because it exCends
the scope of the Bil as passed by that Bouse.
This is a war measure respecting mnsurance,
and was discussed in aur committee, as was
the amendment, at some length. I do not
tbink it would be wise ta insist on aur amendment, and, witb the consent of the Senate
I wouhd move:
That the Senate do not insist upon its eleventh
amendment to Bill 56, an Act to make provision
with respect to insurance of property against
war risks and the payment of compensation for
war damage.
Hon. C. C. RALLANTYNE: Honourable
senators, inasmuch as the amendment under
discussion does nlot meet with the approval
of the House of Commons, and in view of the
importance of the Bill and the difficuhty of
putting it into effect, I concur in the motion
just proposed by the leader on the other side.
The motion was agreed ta.
MESSAGE TO HOUSE OF COMMONS

The Senate resumed at eight o'clock.
DOMINION SUCCESSION DUTY BILL
FIRST RIEADING

A message was receîved from the House of
Commons witb Bill 123, an Act ta amend The
Dominion Succession Duty Act.
The Bill was read the first time.
WAR RISK INSURANCE BILL
COMMONS DISAGREEMENT WITH
SENATE AMENDMENT

The Hon. the SPEAKER: Honourable
senators, a message has been received from
the House of Commons in the following
words:
Resolveti that a message be sent to the Senate
to acquaint Their Honours that this House
agrees to their aînendments to Bill 56, an Act
to make provision with respect to insurance of
property against war risks and the payment of
compensation for war damage, with the exception of amendment No. 11, with *which this
House disagrees for the following reason:
Because the amendment extends the scope of
the Bill as passed by the House of Commons.
Hon. J. H. KING: Honourable senators, the
message fromn the House of Commons would
indicate that that Hlouse is not prepared ta
accept one of the amendments which we
made to Bill 56. By thîs amendment, whicb
related to section 26 of the Bill, it was proposed to insert after the word "Canada" the
words "sucli other companies as may satisfy
the Min ister with regard to their financial
standing and ability ta pçrfarm the obligations required af themn under sucb agreement."

Hon. Mr. KING : I would move that a
message be sent ta the Bouse of Commons ta
acquaint that Bouse that the Senate does not
insist on its eleventh amendment ta Bill 56.
Hon. C. P. BEAUBIEN: Would the honourable leader tell us in a few words wbat was
the purport of the amendment?
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE:
It was
include the provincial companies.

ta

Hon. Mr. RING: It was ta bring in certain
companies that are flot under Dominion
registration. We had hoped that the Minister
wouhd accept the amendment. In the committee he intimated that he would do so, but
he met with opposition in the Bouse of
Commons.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: I thought he was
willing ta accept it, provided the companies
submitted ta inspection and ta the making af
a depusit. Does that stili stand?
Hon. Mr. RING: No.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: Do the Commons
close the door completely?
Hon. Mr. COPP: They disagree with the
amendment.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: They close the door
completely on provincial companies?
Hon. Mr. COPP: Some provincial companies.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: Ail af them?

Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Is flot Lloyd's the

Hon. Mr. KING: No; there are other
companies.
The Minister, I think, found
difficulty iii bringing in provincial companies.
There was some question as to whether, if
they came in, bie should impose certain obligations upon them. It was objected that the
Dominion had no right to go in and inspect.
We thought we had overcome the difficulty
in committee wben we made the amendment.
However, the House of Commons bas not
accepted it.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: AIl right.
The motion was agreed to.
EXCISE BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. J. H. RING moved the second reading
of Bill 110, an Ac±t to amend The Excise
Act, 1934.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: I sce that tbe
items on wbich the taxes are raised are
mentioned in the Bill. Among tbema are beer,
malt, and malt syrup. Inasmuch as this is a
financial Bill and a war measure, I do not
tbink that we cao do anytbing but give it our
approval.
Hon. Mr. KCING: I thank the honourable
leader opposite.
The main feature of the Bill is that it
rncrcases thie excise duty on spirits. As is
indicated under paragraphas (a), (b), (c) and
(d) of the first part of the sebedule, the dutie.on alcohiol used in pharmaceutical preparations, and in the production of perfumes,
perfumed spirits, vinegar and chemnical compositions, are not changed, it being feit that
an increase io these duties would increase the
cost of the articles procluced.
Thon you wvill notice that where the tax
wvas px'cviously 35 cents per gallon upon beer
brewed froin any substance other than malt,
and 12 cents upon beer imported into Canada,
it is now 45 cents. On malt, where the duty
îormcrly Ivas 12 cents, it is now 16 cents. On
malt syrup manufactured or produced in
Canada, where formerly the duty was 18 cents
per Pound, it ha now 24 cents. Upon malt
eýyrup) imported into Canada, where the duty
was previously 30 cents, it is nowv 40 cents.
The onily change in regard to tobacco is
that Canadian raw leaf tobacco, whcb formerly pahd 10 cents per Pound, now pays 20
cents.
That, I think, is the whole story of the Bill.
Hon. Mir. copp.

Hon. IVA C. FALLIS: Honourable senators.
as this is a Bill dealing wîtb a subjeet of
particular interest to women as a whole, I
should like to make a few remarks on it from
tbe viewpoint of Canadian women. When tbe
Bill was under discussion in another place the
Minister of Finance made the statement that
bie did ot believe this increase of $2 a gallon
in excise tax on spirits would materially reduce
consumer expenditure along this line. Neither
would the increase from 12 cents to 16 cents
imposed on malt. That would mean but a
slight increase, if any, in the cost of beer,
and could not be expected to divert many
dollars from consumer expenditure.
Concern bas been expressed by leaders of
aIl parties in the other Huse, including the
Prime Minister, over the tremendous increase
in the sale of alcoholic beverages despite the
heavy taxation. The wbole situation bas given
cause for grave anxiety tbrougbout Canada,
not only among probibitionista and teetotallers, but among aIl thinking people wbo bave
at hcart the carryhng on of a maximum and
total war effort.
Canada's drink bill bas risen from $153,000,000 in 1938 to $232,000,000 in 1940; and a
minimum estimate of $250,000,000 is made for
1942. In my own province alone tbe total
sales by the Liquor Control Board rose from
lesa than $50,000,000 ho tbe fiscal year before
thie war to more than $64,000,000 in 1941, an
increase of almiost $15,000,000.
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: Is tbat witbout any
increase io the price at whicb tbe products

Honourable senators, I am confident in
my own mind that if the Dominion Government wouid take steps along these linos te
give leadership in the solving ef this probiem,
it would liave the support of the majority of
our citizens, certainly the support ef an
overw.ielîning ntajerity of the women of

the consumption of liquor is a very apt one.
A campaign to that end, whether conducted
by the radio or in the Press, would to my
mind be a practical method of attacking the
problem. We all admit that liquor, if indeed it
does not do us harm, cannot do us very much
good. But I feel sure my honourable friend
must realize, as the rest of us do, how difficult
it is at any time to impose definite and
extensive restrictions on the consumption of
beer, wine and liquors. It is particularly
difficult in Canada at this time, because liquor
is legally sold throughout a large part of
the country and people feel they have a right
to purchase it and drink it. T-bat is why I
think a reasonable attempt on the part of
the Government to influence the people to
decrease their consumption of alcoholie beverages would be a very important step in the
The honourable senator
right direction.
should be commended for bringing this matter
before the Senate, and I think from the
remarks I heard in the other House the
Government is giving it consideration.
The Bill now before us was introduced by
the Minister of Finance for the purpose of
increasing the revenues of the country, and
of course if we drink more liquor those
revenues will be correspondingly increased.
On the other hand, if there is a reduction in
the consumption of liquor the national revenue will not be increased as he had hoped.
My honourable friend is correct in saying
that if we could induce people to drink less
beer and buy more war bonds more money
would flow into the treasury. But in case
my honourable friend may feel that no ressponse is made to her splendid suggestions, I
have thought it desirable to draw the attention of the House to these facts in order
thàt honourable members may realize the
control of liquor is very difficult to handle,
even more so at the present time than in the
past. I am sure that when those in charge
read my honourable friend's remarks they
will appreciate the very reasonable suggestions
she las made and give them their best and,
we hope, favourable consideration.
Hon. A. L. BEAUBIEN: Honourable
senators, I think the honourable member
should be given credit for bringing this matter
to our attention. There is no argument in
favour of alcoholic beverages, for the simple
reason that you are better without them.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: You may miss a
good deal of fun by abstaining, but undoubtedly you are better without alcoholie
beverages.

During the last war and for some time
after, in the province where I live, prohibition was in force. If there ever was a period
in the history of Manitoba when young people were led astray through blind pigs and
similar places where they could get liquor
illegally, it was during that period. Several
organizations to-day would have our Governments, provincial and federal, do soñiething
drastic in order to prevent the increasing
consumption of liquor, but I would say to
my honourable friend: I do not care what
Government action may be taken, unless you
can educate the people to be temperate, any
attempt to restrict the sale of liquor will
simply create another problem, one far worse
than the problem confronting us to-day.
I have a great deal of respect for the
organizations which are advocating prohibitionHon. iMrs. FALLIS: I do not think I made
use of the word "prohibition" at all. I was
not speaking from that particular angle.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: I will say restriction
of the sale and consumption of liquor. That
there are evils in the liquor traffic no one will
deny, and my suggestion to the honourable
member and to those organizations who desire
to curb the liquor traffic is that they educate
the people and warn them of the dangers of
intemperance, rather than attempt to bring
back prohibition with all its evil consequences.
I represent a county in Manitoba bordered
by the states of Minnesota and Dakota and
by the province of Ontario. During those
prohibition years you could not go into any
home without finding some home-made
alcoholic beverage. I certainly should not
like to see that condition return. I repeat,
the only way of getting rid of intemperance
is by education, and I would urge every
organization interested in temperance to stress
the evils of excessive indulgence in alcoholic
beverages, rather than ask the Government
to take drastic action.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. W. E. FOSTER: Honourable senators,
I have had some experience in the administration of liquor laws, having had a prohibition law left on my door-step. This had to
be abandoned in favour of a form of control.
I quite agree with all the honourable member
from St. Jean Baptiste (Hon. A. L. Beaubien)
has said as to the difficulty of handling this
problem. The only way is to educate the
people to a realization of the dangers of
intemperance. But at the present time it
seems to me that as we have restrictions

Hon. Mis. FALLIS: Honourable senators,
from the remarks of the bonourable senator
from St. Jean Baptiste (Honi. Mr. Beaubien)
and tbe bonourable senator from Vancouver
(Hon. Mr. MeRae), I gatiier that althougbh the
women of ýCanada are patriotic enougli to
go 'vithout clothes and necessities in their
homes in order to buy Victory bonds, yet the
men of Canada biave flot sufficient patriotismi
to go without alcobiolie bev-crages, which tbey
would be obliged to do if the sale and
consumption of liquor- were placed under
sev ere restrictions.
Hon. Mr. ýMcRAE: I knowv the loyalty of
the marriud womcn of tbis country, and it
equals that of oui older marricd men. But
those men are flot responsible for the increasing liquor consumption. The, alarming increase
is one of the results of greater 1rosperity:
to-day the average man bias more money than
bie evur liad, and hie takus a little liquor
because it makes bim fuel the joy of living.
I hope the women of this country will be
succezssul in their efforts to lessen the
consumption of liquor, but they nmust look
dloser home. I wish the daughters of the
mothers who are sponsoring tbis very laudable
effort to bring about greater temperance were
living up to the precupts of thieir mothers.

muan. that I amn a prohibitionist. I bave been

Thbis question is giving this country a great

dual of concern. Protests are coming frorn
uvc.ry province with respect to the increame
in the consumption of alcobolic beverages of
ail kinds. What I arn concerned about mostly
is the consumption of alcoholie beverages in

Sornu Hon. SENATORS: Hear, bear.

JULY 29, 1942
Hon. Mr. HARMER: How are you going
to prevent it?
Hon. Mr. QUINN: I cannot affer a solution,
but to me it looks as though a man, as soon
as he dons a uniform, thinks he must learn
how ta drink whisky and soda. Not long ago
an hanourable gentleman opposite sat in the
same railway coach with me while travelling
from here to Montreal. Two high-ranking
naval officers came into the smoking campartment. After ligbting a cigarette, the first thing
tbey did was to ring the bell and oail the
porter to aek bim to put up a table and bring
in cracked ice and glasses. Then they produced a quart flask of whisky and proceeded
ta drink it. Not long afterwards two highr-anking army officers axrived on the scene,
and they went through the same procedure.
You do not see civilians ordering up cracked
ice and producing whisky and soda in that
way.
Hon. Mr. DUFFUS: Oh, yes, you do.
Hon. Mr. QUINN: Very rarely.
Hon. Mr. DUFFUS: On every train.
Hon. Mr. QUINN: Do not be too hasty in
vour defence. The last time I went down to
Halifax I rode on the Ocean Liited,' which
consisted of eighteen cars. Nearly every passenger on that train was an officer of the Air
Force, the Navy or the Army, and when they
wanted a drink they did not do what you or
I would do if we wanted a drink-go into
the smoking compartmient and have it; tbey
pulled out a flask or a bottle right in the main
-section of the car, irrespective of the presence
o>fladies, children or anybody else, and started
their orgies, -and there was drunkennees from
the time we left Montreal titI we got to
Hlalifax. I was ashamed, and I amrn ft a temperance advocate. I lîke adrink of whisky or
beer, but I do not like ta see boys in the
condition that some of thema were in on that
train. As bas been said, we cannot drink ouýr
way ta victary.
I arn glad thiis subjct bas been brought to
the attention of the House, because some
educational measures must be instituted
amongst aur armed forces in order ta prevent
the excessive use of intoxicating beverages.
It is a shame and a crime. I almost cried at
what I saw. As I was going th-rough to the
(lining car I met two lovely yaung fellows
whose fathers and mathers I knew-two of
the Ioveliest young fellows an God's earth,
and bath were drunk. T.hey were campanians
of my own son. I stapped ane af them. I
saîd: "Camne here, boy. Do yeur mother and
father know that yau are doing this?" "Oh,"

373

he said, "we are just an aur way overseas.
Father and mother will not see me, because
we wilI go rigbt ta the dock and straight
aboard tbe ship."
I contend, honourable senators, that this
is nat rig.ht. I amn net preaching a sermon,
and I amn not moralizing. But this tbing
hurts me. I say it is not right, and that is
why I support tbe honourable senator from
Peterborough in ber effort ta bring ît -ta the
attention af the Gaverament. The Federal
Government cannot evade its responsibility in
respect ta this any mare than it can evade it
in respect ta any other commodity. It regulates tbe price and the use of clotbing, of
matar cars, rubber, and many other things.
Why ean it not regulate the sale and use of
intaxicating liquors?
I know the agument of the honourable
Minister of Finance in the other House. He
is a good friend of mine, and I admire and
respect hlm. He is a man who does not
ind-ulge in Liquor himself. I know that he
said, "W'e cannot do it; it is the responsibility of the provincial governments."
In that connectian, I pay tribute ta the
Premier of Nova Scotia, wbo has made every
effort possible ta curtail the sale of intaxicating liquors in his province. He shortened
the hours of sale.
Hon. Mr. HARMER: And what bappened?
Hon. Mr. QUINN: Just a minute now. Do
nat go too fast. I will tell you what happcned. Instead of there being one line of
people gaing into the lîquor stores, there
were six. That is what happened. But the
heurs of sale were sbortened because it was
not possible ta get a suflicient supply of
liquor t'a seli. I know that for a fact.
Hon. Mr. HARMER: T-hen how were the
sales increased?
Hon. Mr. QUINN: It was a year ago that
the sales increased. I arn talking about July.
The hours were sbortened only at the end
of last year, but the stores were wide open
six days a week fro-m nine until six.
Hon. Mr. HARMER: Tbe sales incereased
thirty-five per cent.
Hon. Mr. QUINN: In 1941, yes, but dýurîng
Cbristmas week of last year, I think, the
heurs were reduced. Last year ini the little
province of Nova Scotia, with a population
of only haif a million people, tbe total grass
sales amounted ta something like $12,000,000,
and there was a net profit of $3,500,000. This
is tao much; it shows too great a consumption
of intoxieating beverages. The reason given

374

SEýNATE

for it was, "We have had an increase of
population in the services, and have had to
supply the A.rmy, the Navy and the Air
Force as weIl as the civilians." If that is the
answer, I say that soýmething should be done
to curtail the use of alcoholie beverages. particularly among the young men in our arrnad
forces.
Hon. Mr. HARMER: Have you any suggestion te make as to how that could be
accomplished?
Hon. Mr. FOSTER: Carriedi
Hon. Mr. QUINN: No, honestly, I have
net. But 1 commend the lady senator frorn
Peterborough for bringing this roatter to the
attention of the Government, se that its
experts and authorities may put their heads
togethcr and work out some scherne whereby
the sale and use of intoxicating liquors may
be reduced.
Hon. Mr. HARMER: I agree with everything you say. The difficulty is to, find a
solution.
Hon. Mr. QUINN: I agree with you in that.
Hon. J. H. KING: I do not want to prolong this debata, but I think I should say
that when the Minister increased, the duty on
spirits from $7 to 39 he was worried by the
thought that the increase might stimulate the
bootlegging traffie. We had an experience of
prohibition during and after the last war, and
it was neithar good nor healthy, and the
results flowing from it were not good.
We have arrived at a system whareby eight
of the provinces have taken over the control
in this matter. It is true that the Government
might prohibit the manufacture of alcohol in
Canada, but it could not prohibit the manufacture in the United States, and it would not
be able to enforce a prohibition against home
manufacture. One of the strange things about
alcohol is that it can ha made front almost
any vegetable matter, and it is amazing how
people will laarn to produce spirits and wines.
The consumption of thase articles is greater
undar prohibition than if they were sold under
regulation.
I have no doubt that, as was
stated by the Prime Minister and bv Mr.
Ilslay, the Gov ernment is giving much thoughlt
to this question.
Speaking of people generally, and of youog
mean going into the armed forces particularly,
I may say that I do not think prohibition
would bring the results desired. On the contrary, I think it would do more harm than
good. I quite agrea with the honourable
sanator from St. Jean Baptiste (Hon. A. L.
Beaubien) that if the ternjwrance p)eo, e arc
Hon. Mr. QUINN.

really seriously interestad in temperance or
prohibition they would do well to organize
the old-fashioned temperance lodges in the
various communities throughout Canada and
would there encourage temperance and show
the people the injurious affects that corne
from. an undua use of alcoholie liquors. If
we could get back to that basis, I think, we
might makae some real progress.
I do not balieve that governments ean
accomplish much.
They may restrict the
sale or the manufacture, but if the legal
manufacture is curtailed there will be the
underground manufacture by the illicit still,
as was demonstrated in hoth Canada and the
United States during prohibition days.
I arn quite sympathetia to what the lady
member has said. I do hope the ladies will
be able to buy some dresses. I arn sure that
if there is any way in which governments can
improve this condition, they will be glad to
do what they can.
I was surprisad to hear the honourable
senator fromt Bedford-Halifax
(Hon. Mr.

Vancouver and Ottawa, and I have not sean
a great deal of drinking on the trains.
Furthermore, in the centre of the city of
Vancouver, in what w~as once known as the
Vancouver Rotai, thare are some fifteen
hundred or two thousand soldiers in barracks.
I hi: ve liv ed right next to thern and have sean

fact, I thought and still think that the officers
have on the whole been exercising a satisfactory control ever the activities of the soldiers
under their command. Excessive drinking has
net beau really noticeable. One will meet
with some cases, of course, but that is truc at

However. as the Prima Minister said the
other day, it is desirable to lessen the consumptinofn liquor.

SECOND READING

H-on. W. M. ASELTINE moved the second

William Taffert.
Hon. 'JAMES MURD0CK:
Honourable
senators, I should much prefer to sjt in My
seat quiethy and permit this motion for
second reading to go through, as is usual w.itb
divorce buis. But the other day, in filing
a min.ority report on this case, I said:
In rry judgment, this case appears to be a
simple "frame-up" against this woman by the
petitioner.
Stili holding that firma conviction, 1 shauld
regard myseif as disloyal ta decent women
if I did not by every means at my disposai
oppose this Bill1. I realize that there is a
strong mai ority againat me. Three distinguished legal gentlemen, ta say nathing af one
other honourable member of the committee,
hold views different fromn mine with respect
to, this case. But I have alwaya had in the
past and stili have some firmn convictions, and,
I hope, somne knowledge of human nature and
some ability ta judge when the truth emanates
fromn the moutbs of either men or women.
I intend ta go into, this matter at considerable length to-night. I hope honourable
senators will have patience with me. My legal

375

friends on the Divorce Committee base their
judgment largely on the fact that two detectives, ten months and ten days after the
alleged *occurrence of May 9, 1941, identified
the respondent, the woman who was before
the cammittee. I am here ta say to-night
that it is a little more than four months
since this case was heard, and I doubt very
much if I or any member of the committee
could identify that woman if. we saw hier
walking down the street.-unless, of course,
she bappened ta have on a red bait. 'Sa what
is there ta this identification before the
committee? Ahl there is ta it is that every
one present at tbe committee knew the
petitioner's wife, the respandent, was present;
s0 it was very easy ta idcntify her there.
Wbat were the chances for identification by
the two detectives on May 9, 1941? There
was far less chance of determining what the
woman looked like then than there was in aur
committee room.
I am going ta place on record right here
and naw part of the cross-examination of
the petitioner. I shahl not take any more
time than I thînk is absolutely necessary ta
bring before honourabie senators wbat I
regard as important information in connection
with this case. The cross-examination of
the petitibner by Mr. Rudner, the lawyer for
the respondent, begins at page 15 of the
committee's printed report.
(Hon. Mr. ýMURDOCK then read from
the .printed report of the evidence taken
before the Cammittee on~ Divorce.)
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Mr. Speaker, I
do not tbink there is a quorum in -the House.
The Hon. tbe SPEAKER: I will ask the
Clerk ta count the members ta sec wbether a
quorum is present.
The CLERK: There are fifteen senators
present, Mr. Speaker.
The Hon. the SPEAKER:

The point is

Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: I beg Your
I-lonour's pardon. One gentleman lias just

Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: Can the honourable senator from Parkdaie tell me what is
his abject in reading ail these questions and
answers? They surely do nat go ta prove
that the matrimonial offence charged was not
committed.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: I will give you ail
of the wife's and the daughter's evidence before I get through. (Senator Murdock continuied bis reading of the evidence.)

Mr. MURDOCK:
The e' idence

They desire to put this divorce through, which

everything in my power to prevent this injustice. As 1 saici the other day, 1 believe

Nothing iii tlîis section shaîl miake it han fui

Hon. Mr. HAIG: Mr. Speaker, I rise to a
point of order. Is the honourable member
from Parkdale (Hon.,Mn. Murdock) at liberty
te nead into the Senate Hansard evidence
taken before our Divorce Cornrittee? There
is ne restriction on the distribution of
Senate Hansard, whereas, under the rules,
divorce evidence can be distrîbuted only te
members of tbe Senate and of the House of
Cernmens.
Hon. Mr. COPP: And 'tbey are not
permitted te distribute that evidence.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I do net tbink it cana be

Hon. Mr. MURDOCIÇ: Yen distribute

The bon. the SPEAKER: I bave be.en

Order raised by tbe bonourable member from
Winnipeg Soutb-Centre (Hon. Mr. Haig).
It seîns te me entirely ont of order for an

Conimittee of tbe Senate.
Consequently I
ruIe that the point of order is well taken, and
thlut sticl evidnlee should net appear in tlîe

Hon. Mr. HARMER: Ail tbe evidence

Hon. Mr. ROBIN'SON: I tbjnk se too.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Good-bye, tlien,

woman and a deceot girl. But members are
ready te accept, witbout aniy discussion, the
swNorn and, I tbink, perjured testimony of an
ingrate, a rotter. a rat, and of two detectives
wbio baci been engaged te do bis dirty work
and were paid therefor. That is my personal
.iudgment of tbis particular case. I tbink it
is unfortunate tlîat we cannot get these facts

JULY 29, 1942
Hon. Mr. COTÉ: May 1 rise to a point of
order? I cannot quite understand the ruling
of lis Honour. Parliament bas always been
considered the last court of recourse in the
land, and we are in fuit session assernbled,
sitting as a court of Parliament. Does the
ruling go to the extent of saying t-hat we
in this court cannot verbally or orally mention
or recite the evidence taken by a committee
of this -House? Or did Ris Honour sirnply
intend to rule that wben the evidence of
these proceedings of the Senate Committee is
read here it should not be taken down by our
reporters and sbould not be published as part
of the Senate Debates? If the second prohibition is flot what is intended by Ris Honour,
I arn sure there will be some disagreement.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: Does the bonourable senator intend to appeal from my
decision?
Hon. M. COTÉ: I want to understand the
decision correctly. I want to make sure
whetberHon. Mr. COPP: I submit niy honourable
friend is entirely out of order in discussing the
point of order. Ris Ronour the Speaker has
already decided.
Hon. Mr. COTÉ: I arn asking Ris Honour
.sel
whether his rulingThe Hon. the SPEAKER: I haveHon. Mr. COTÉ: I want bis interpretation.
Hon. Mr. COPP: Sit down. Ris Honour is
addressing the House.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: I have given rny
ruling. Whether it is rigbt or wrong is another
matter. Hon. Senator Coté rnay appeal frorn
my ruling, but hie cannot discuss it.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: And Your Honour
knows I have as rnuch chance of proceeding
as I had in filing rny rninority report.
Hon. Mr. COTÉ: I rose, not to question or
appeal the ruling of Ris Honour, but sirnply
to obtain an elucidation of the ruling so that
1 rnigbt know howHon. Mr. COPP: I subrnit there is no responsibility on the part of Ris Honour the
Speaker to elucidate or explia-m bis ruling.
Hon. Mr. COTÉ:- -how the House will be
governed by it. I was bopîng the ruling meant
if the evidence is read here it should not go
on Hansard. If it means something else, I
submit to the ruling.
Hon. Mr. COPP. I subrnit that was not the
ruling of Ris Honour. On the point of order
it was objected that the honourable member
frorn Parkdale (Hon. Mr. Murdock) had no

right to read this evidence, because as soon
as he had read it it becarne part of the Senate
Hansard, and was thus further publication of
the evidence. Such publication is against the
law. Then Ris Honour tbe Speaker ruled on
that question. It was suggested by my bonourable friend to my right (Hon. Mr. Harmer)
that inasmuch as part of the evidence had
been read it should be expunged from the
record.
Hon. Mr. ROBINSON: I do not want to
take advantage of the honourable senator who
is dealing with this matter. Perhaps I should
have read the whole of section 322 of the
Criminal Code so as not to leave a wrong
impression with honourable members. In
addition to what I rend, the section continues:
-if the report is published without authority
from or 1teave of the House in which the proceeding was bad or contrary to any rule, order
or practice of that House..
1 take that to mean that the Rouse may
grant leave if it wisbes to do so.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: There it is, you sec.
1 arn a member of the Senate, but I have to
get permission te defend an honourable
wornan.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: You are not counfor the defence.
Hon. Mr. 'MURDOCK: Arn I not?
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: She had two lawyers.
Hon. M.r. MURDOCK: I arn counsel for
rny own conscience, and I filed a rninority
report in wbich I stated that there was a
frarne-up against an innocent wornan by two
detectives and the petitioner.
I would respectfully ask Ris Honour whether
I arn in a position to proceed any further or
not.
Hon. Mr. COPP: You have a perfect right
to argue the case.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: I cannot very wel.l
argueHon. M-r. ASELTINE: I object to any consent being gîven.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: I cannot very welI
argue without bringing out the facts on whicb
rny judgrnent is hased, and those ,facts are
contained in the record of the evidence that
I heard in the comrnittee. I do not know
how to argue witbout showing what I amn
talking about.
Sorne Hon. SENATORS:

Question!

Hon. Mr. 'MURDOCK: I arn the one who
is asking the question.

SENATE

Hon. Mr. ROBINSON: It is a littie difficuit for Ris ilonour the Speaker to make a
ruling on this; but if the honourable gentleman would agree nlot to infliet, upon us ail the
evidence, we might be very glad to have him
go on. I tbink, however, it is hardly fair to
the meînbers of the Senate to ask tbem to
listen to page after page of evidence which
tbey have had before tbem. I think it is flot
very courteous.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: The bionourable gentleman apparontly bas to get the consent of the
bouse to read the evidence. One honourable
gentleman has objected to giving that consent.
I amn another who does so. If the honourable
gentleman will get Up and say that hie is ot
trying to carry on a blockýade until eleven
o'edock, when the House will adjourn, I shall
ho pcrfectiy content to let 1dm. read whatever
he likes. But this is purely a biockade, and
the bonourable gentleman knows it as well as
I do. The evidence bas been printed and

distributed to ail honourable members.

The Honi. the SPEAKER: Ilonourable sonators, bec:îuse of theo poýition which I occupy
in tis~ IlMî'e 1 am nflt at liberty to enter
inito anY~cnrvrx
whatever. It is my
understanding, after a long exporience of
pariiaînntar 'yaffairs, tbat the evidence taken
before tlie Standing Committee on Divorce
is of a private nature; and a weii-known
pîraci
preî ents such cx idenice being disÉribîîîcd to the public. It is distributed only
to nicaibt rs of Parlianacut.
W bat cannot be done directly sbould flot
be done iî'dircctly. To read the evidence of
wliat lî'j pened in the prescrit instance does
nt appieair to nie to be nccording to the
practice. and 1 do nt think it wouid ho in
the poillîe interest to permit this evidence to
be read in this Cliamber, thereby making it

point of order is well taken, and tliat no

The ronaarkis made a moment ago by the

I think that every

bearing

the

honourable senator from Parkdale at a previous

session of this Huse, bas rend the evidence,
and it seems to me that the bionourable gentleman would ho doing justice to bis own
conviction and to tbe Hýouse if bie were just
to speak on the principal objections be bas
and omit the reading of the evidence.

Hon. Mr. MURDOOX: I could, of course.
do that; but in doing it I migbt flot be altogetlier accurate.
I sbould like bonourable
senators to exorcise their own judgment, so
far as tboy can, after listening to the questions
and the answers. They cannot see, as I did
during tbe whole course of tbe trial, the
woman and bier daugbter.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: 1 ar not a lawyoî , but common sense teils mje that as this
case bas been heard by the committee, whioh,
afteýr ail is a judicial body, or a court, that
sbould ptut an end to the hearing of evidence
so far as this House is concerned. The committee lias giveli its decision, and for the
lionourable senator from Parkdaie to objeet is,
to my mind, an extraordinary proceeding,
ani altogetlier out of order. Wbat rigbt bave
we in this Hlouse to hear the evidence? Tbe
ovidence was gix on before the Divorce
Comnmit tee.
lon. Mr. MURDOCK: But we are passing
on tuie second reading of this Bill, and we
have been educated to believe that we bave
a rigbit on second reading to discuss tbe facts
concerned and the questions involved in a
partieular bill. That is ail 1 have been trying
to d o. I amn wiliing to bow to the wiilî of the
Senate. If you do ot want to hear any more
about this, it ýis ail riglit so far as I arn concorned. 1 will refrain from reading the evidence.' I had intended to read a little more
of this man Taffort's evidonce; thon. I intended
to read the evidence of the woman and bier
sixtoon-ycar-old daughter, botlî of wvhom I
regard as bcing crucified by a couple of perjured dotectives. No, I do ot believe tbey
knew tbey were telling a lie. I believe the
petitionor "framed Up" the woman. He hired
the detectives; the lawyer did flot.
Now, can this potitioner do tlîat kind of
tbing? Down in New York bis wife had to get
$1,000 to keep binai out of jail for embezzling
mnoney, and later sho liad to put up another
$500 because ho said hoe necded it to moin an
organization and proteet bis job. Both of
thesc dlaims xvcre 'plioney"; both of them
were grafting. Tbat is the kind of man lie
was. 1 say thiat lie is exactly t11 e type uf
mnan xvho would arrange to dIo just wliat ivas
donc in this case.

JULY 29, 1942
Arn I justified in that belief? Well, on
the 30th of April lie went ta the landiord of
tbe house wliere bais wif e was staying and
served notice on lii that lie would no longer
pay tbe rent. On that date lie engaged the
two detectives. Then within a very few days
what occurred? He proceeded ta get what
lie asserts is evidence. It is my personal
judgment tbat lie just hired a "stoogie" wornan
wbase niglit's work was ta keep tliem around
tlie corner of St. Antoine and Windsor streets
in Montreal; a woman wlio lived at the Hutchison streat address wliere lie liad planted
or put bis wife. Ail lie lad an this wornan
tao distinguisli lier from. anybody else was a
red bat. H1e was sitting in tbe back of the
car, croucbed down, and lie says that lie was
painting out this woman ta, the detectives,
and tbat tliey watcbed the woman witli the
red bat. I do nat believe for a moment, and
neyer did, that the woman witli the red bat
was Mrs. Taffert. I believe the wbole thing
was purely and simply a frame-up made liy
Taffert because lie bad secured from her 81,000
an ana occasion and $500 on another,' and did
flot want ta pay those surna back. Ha did
nat want ta pay lier family, but lie wanted
ta unload the woman and lier sixteen-yearaid daugliter.
I sbould bave liked ta place an the record
tlie evidence of Mrs. Taffert, because ta me
it was canvincing. Maybe I arn wrong in rny
judgment. If so, the judgment of lionourable
gentlemen would be just as good as mine. But
I sat in an this case, and I tliink tlie detectives
were just made use of. Imagine if you will,
bonourable senators, a petitianer and two
detectives being an duty for ten liaurs and
thirty minutes, from before eiglit a'clock at
niglit till six o'clock in the marning, and for
seven hours and thirty minutes or eiglit liaurs
of that time being around the camner of
St. Antoine and Windsor streete. Tlien tliey
went up ta Sherbirooke street, wliere tbey
were on duty a while longer, until the petitioner Taffert and the other detectives were
tired out and Mr. Green, one of the detectives, kindly took tliem home so that tbey
cauld go ta bed. One wauld bave thouglit
that after that lengtb of time on duty Green
would naed sleep and rest too. But no. He
went back ta this place wliere lie had this
"(stoogie" waman, and staycd around, and at
about six o'clock in the marning lie was just
iii timne ta sec, tlie woman getting into the
man's car and starting for tlie Hutchison
street address. Green followed along carefully bebind the "stoogie's" car until they al
came to the Hutchison street address, where
the woman got out of the car and sliook lier
fist at liim.

379

Does anybody believe that a combination
of circumstances like that would develop or
that it could occur? I do flot believe it.
But I amrn ft permitted to handie this matter
as I thouglit necessary in order to make my
argument reasonably eonvincing. The petitioner bas proved bimself to be a rotter and
a rat. I thouglit the evidence of the woman
and of the 15-i-year-o1d girl would bave been
of some benefit in protecting the honour and
the rights of a persan wbom. I regard as a
normal, bonest maTried woman, and of lier
daughter. But I will say no more.
Hon. C. W. ROBINSON: Honourable
senators, I was present at the trial of this
case, but not the other day when the matter
was decided by the committee. I sympathize
witli the lionourable senator fromn Parkdale,
wbô has just spoken (Hon. Mr. Murdock).
1 arn not quite sure wbat attitude I sliould
have taken had I been present wlien the
matter was decided. I do not like ta impugn
the evidence of any witness, but in this
committee we hear a good deal of evidence
by people wliom we do not entirely believe
and wlio sometimes actually contradict themsalves. In this case there is some ground for
the argument of my honourable .friend from
Parkdale. I suppose I should support the
finding of the majority, who did their best ta
arrive at the correct conclusion. Tliey did not
balieve the evidence given by the respondent.
As a inatter of fact, 1 did not believe it
myself. On one sida we had evidence given
by the liusband and two detectives, which was
contradicted an. the other side by the respondent and bier daug-hter. There is some question in my mind as ta whetber we should give
the woman tbe benafit of the doubt. I do not
know whetlier I sbould say that, especially
as, I did not balieve ber evidence.
As far as I personally arn concerned, I suppose I shail bave ta vote in support of the
committee's racommendatian.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: May I ask the
lionourable gentleman a ques-tion?
Hon. Mr. ROBINSON: Yes.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Wauld you place
any credence at ail in the evidence of tbe
petitioner, considering wliat lie himself said
he was?
Hon. Mr. ROBINSON: I do not think the
petitioner gave any evidence that was nat
more or less corroborated.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Oh, yes, lie did.
Hon. Mr. ROBINSON. As far as I personally arn concerned, I shall have ta leave
the matter for the Senate ta decide wliat
they think is best ta do.

Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE:
Would the

Hon. Mr. ROBINSON:
Hon. Mr. HAIG:

Yes.

No.

Hon. Mr. ROBINSON: The Acting Chairman of the Comrnittec Mon. Mr. Aseltine)

Hon. Mi-. ASELTINE: I con tell the bhonourable leader on this side (Hon. Mr.
Ballantyne) that it would net make the least
bit of difference if that were done. The members of the commjttee who voted in favour
of the petition were absoluteiy convinoed in
the motter, and I amn firmily of the opinion
that the bonourable senator frorn Parkdale
(Hon. Mr. Murdock) is ent.irely wrong in the
view ho has taken with regard to the wliole
case. It is regrettable that tbis kind of thing
should arise, and I hope that next session
or sonie time in the icar future Parliament
will pass an Act transferring ail divorce matters
coming from the provinces whose courts have
not divorce jurisdiction to the Exchequcr
Court of Canada or socle other body.
Hou. Mr. MURDOC;K:

bear, hear.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE:
The Exchequer
Court i-. a travelling court. That is, it goes
from place to place and ixears cases of
differviit kinds. If. could hold sittings in the
two provines which now have no divorce
jurisdiction,
namely
Quebcc and Prince
Edward Islond. That would relieve Parliament entirely of discussions en divorce cases
and w ould Le a more satisfactory way of
dealing with the question, as a whole. Morecicr, thie expen:ýe to litizants would Le mucli
le-'. It costs a considerable suin of money
te take one of these cases Lefore Parliament,
f0 paoy the fees for a private bill and to
pay counsel and witfness fees, to say nothing
of hringing wifncs-.es froin voii-ous ports of
Q uebec or Prince Edward Islond.
Furfherinorc, Parliairnent hos no j urisdiction
o'.er alimony or custody of children or the
awarding of cosf s, or anything of thaf kind.
Ail such matters could Le dealf with Ly the
Exchequer Court or whatever body is authorized te (leal wvitl the cases. Therefore I
hope a bill to remove divorce cases from
Parlioment will be introduced next session. I
am desirous that this should Le done in the
near future, Lecause on account of the large
numLer of hîosty war-time marriages we shahl
Le swamiped wifhi applications if we are stili

mniformi the House early next year what f bev
think should Le done.
lon. Mi. MURDOCK: May I ask, the
Ixunourable gentleman a question? This case.
as, we aIl know, was heard on the I7th of
March. Personolly I thougbt it was in the
discard until the 20th of July, when we got
notice of a meeting on the 21sf, under the
Acting ChairmonHon. Mr. ASELTINE: I will net occept
:bny reflections ot ail froin the honourable
ixiember from Parkdale.
lon. Mr. MUIlDOCK: Just a minute. 1
arn asking a question. Did a lowyer in thiý
townl, whio was interesfed in this case, approacli
Yoeu in order te gef a decision on the case?
boit. Mr. ASELTINE: Thaf is ahsolufeh v
false. 1 do net know only howyer iii towx
whîo lias anything to do with this case. The
oîîly person who ilp-ooic-hid me os Acting
('hairmian. in the absence of the Chairmaui
(bon. Mr. Robinson), was Mr. Hinds, th(,
dck of ail the Senate committees, whio sail

Hon. Mr. 'MURDOCK: I arn gl.gd te hear
that.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: That is abselutelv
ail I kaow about if.
Hon. Mc. MNURDOCK: I amn glad te hear itbon. Mr. ASELýTINE: I could net de anytlîing but fix a date foc consideration cf the
cases.
Hon. Mr. DAVID: bonourable scooteors, 1
ertainly do net, intend to discuss any aspects
et this case. As is well known. those of uq
who cerne froim the province of Quebec
Ltanfcom discussing divorce cases. I risc
te inquice about a motter of procedure wbichi
I cannot vecy wchl understand, and I do if
solely te seek enlightenment and flot te
criticize. The ruling made by His Honour the
Speaker may affect questions arising bore in
the future. As I undecsfood bis Henour's
decision, it wos te the effeet 'that the Cernmit tee on Divorce is a court, that the evidence

generally spcoking, Le either accepted or
rejecte-d by the Senafe. With ail respect, may
I soy duit I remain under the impression thaf
any cemmit.tee appoi-nted by the Senate
possesses only the powers delegafed te it, and
that any evidence produced before a committce and any report mode by if is subject

JULY 29, 1942
to discuss-ion by the Senate. Otherwise, the
cornrittee would have more power than this
House, which delegated the power.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE:
Honourable
s'enators, I move in amendment, that this Bill
be flot now rend a second tirne, but be referred back to the cornmittee for further
consideration.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: 1 second the motion.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Honourable senators, if
flhat motion were carried it would be tantamnount to rejecting the petition for divorce.
If the House wants to do that, it need only
vote against the motion for second reading.
The Divorce Committee is different froin
our other committees. As I have said before,
none of its members want to be on it at ail.
We ait as a judicial cormîittee and judgc
wvhich aide in each case is telling the trutb,
and corne to our conclusion accordingly. In
this particular case I thought the wornan ivas
not telling the truth, and I thouglit so
throughout the hearing. The question raised
by the honourable meinher from Parkdalc
(Hon. Mr. Murdock) was one of identification.
That was disposed of. Both the detectives
identified the woman, but as far as I was
(oncerned I did flot nccd that identification,
because I was convinced the respondent was
the woman in question. She had a patent
answer-'No," "Neyer,' "No, never,"-which
she made to numerous questions. The majority of the members of the comrnittee had
no difficulty in reaching their decision.
The reason why the decision was not
roaclied until July, although the evidence
was beard in March, is that it was impossible
until recently to get together a quorum of
members who heard the evidence. I arn one
of the guilty ones. The Senate was not
sitting in April, and in June it sat for only
one week, and I was flot here then. In May
we were very busy on other cases, and at
times when we were not busy it was again
difficuit to get a quorum of members who
heard the evidence.
If the Senate decides to rejeet our recorninendation, that will be ail right with me,
but it will make me feel disinclined to serve
on this committee again. As I have aiready
indicated, the Divorce Committee is unlike
other committees.
On the Banking and
Commerce Comrnittee, for instance, you base
your judgment with respect to a bill on the
business principle involved. But in the
Divorce Committee we listen to the evidence
of men and wornen and corne to a decision
as to who are telling the truth. As every

381

lawyer here knows, an Appellate Court is
always loath to interfere with the finding of
a trial judge on a question of fact. But here,
honourable senators, you have a finding by
three trial judges, Senator Aseltine, Senator
Little and myseif. Senator Copp was present
at part of the hearîng. We believed the
petitioner. Senator Murdock believed the
woman, the respondent. That is ail there is
to it.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: You have just
stated who were on the committee whîch heard
this case. I arn ready to take the Bible in
rny hand riglit here and now and swear that
only you and my friend here (Hon. Mr. Robinson) and myseif were on the comrnittee for
the first part of that trial,Hon. Mr. HAIG: I will answer that.
Hon. Mr. MUR'DOCK: -and inter Senator Ascîtine and Senator Little did corne in.
I think 1 can prove by the records that our
friend Senator Copp was not in the ci'ty at
that tirne.
Hon. Mr. COPP: You cannot prove that.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Yes, I can.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: This is what happened.
Senator Aseltine and Senator 'Little did not
hear the examination-in-chief of the petitioner,
but they did hear bis cross-exarnination. But
what the petitioner himself told tbe cornrnittee lad rcally nothing to do with the case.
The material evidence was given by the detectives on cxamination-in-chief and in crossexamination. What I liked about the plaintiff
was tbis-and the honourable senator frorn
Parkdale (Hon. Mr. Murdock) used it against
him: when he was asked about borrowing
certain surns ho answercd, "Ycs."
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: He ncvcr used thc
word "1borrowý' in lus life.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Not one thing was brought
out in cross-exarnination that be did flot
admit. The detective Green lias appeared
beforc the committee several times, and neyer
bias any question arisen in my mmnd as to bis
evidence. Tbere have been other detectives
before us whorn I did not like. Tbere is one
other thing I want to say. This was not a
hard case to decide, for eacb party was represented by counsel, and they are of great
assistance to a court. The case that gives us
trouble is where the petitioner alone is represented by a Iawyer and lie depends on hotel
evidence by deteotivea. I have a very difficult
tirne reaching a decision in such cases, althougb the courts of appeal of my province
have heid that that, is good evidence.

382

SENATE

Hon. Mr. ROBINSON: It has been suggested that divorce cases should be referred
to the Exchequer Court of Canada. I remember very well a discussion I had with the late
leadier of the House, and he favoured the idea.
Following that up, I may say that the Law
Clerk of the Senate has been at work study-ing the situation for some time, but he could
not get anything ready for this session. He
hopes to have a Bill ready for next session,
when it can be discussed on its mnerits. It
would be a great advantage to have such a
court to deal with divorce, particularly where
the question of domicile arises, for the Exchequer Court would have jurisdiction over
the whole Dominion. We have a good man
engaged on the preparation of the Bill to
which I have referred.
Hon. Mr. COTE: In support of the motion
to recommit this Bill to the Divorce Committee, I want to say that I have been in the
Senate since 1933 and this is the first time
that we have had to ddscuss the report of the
Divorce Committee and go into the evidence.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: Pardon me. We are
not discussing the report. The report was
adopted by the Senate. This is an entirely
different matter.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK:

Second reading.

Hon. Mr. COTE: Quite so. I stand corrected. The second reading is very important.
I have a great deal of regard for the legal
acumen and attainments of those members
of the Divorce Committee who have opposed
the amendment. Generally speaking, I may
say I think lawyers who have had a good deal
of practice at the Bar are usually well
trained and able to give a judgment on a
matter of not very complicated evidence,
such as the evidence in a divorce case. On
the other hand, I am not ready to uphold
the proposition that the layman who listens
to that evidence necessarily is wrong if he
comes to an opposite conclusion. The honourable senator from Parkdale (Hon. Mr.
Murdock) has such strong doubts as to
whether the Divorce Committee should have
reported favourably on this petition, that
although usually I do net take an interest in
divorce cases, I think I should hesitate to let
this Bill go through. That doubt is supported
by the statement of the honourable gentleman from Moncton (Hon. Mr. Robinson).
He does not go so far as the honourable
senator from Parkdale, but, like a good judge,
he admits he is perplexed and is not ready
to say what his judgment would have been
if he had been present at the end of the
trial. That influences my judgment too. If
lion. Mr. HAIG.

we are going to sit in appeal, say, from the
report of the committee, we are deprived of
argument with reference to the evidence. I
do not know whether we have been very
helpful te His Honour to-night, or whether
we have sufficiently full knowledge of the
rules to discuss this matter and enable bis
Honour to reach a considered and quick
decision on the point of order. I always take
the view that bis Honour is very much in
the position of a judge. If the advocates
before him do not prepare their case and
supply their authorities, they are putting a
rather difficult proposition to the judge. However, it bas been ruled that it would net be
proper to refer to the evidence in full session
of the Senate. The honourable gentleman
from Sorel (Hon. Mr. David) seemed surprised at that proposition. It does seem
astonishing that a committee of the Senate
can do something that a plenary session of the
Senate cannot do. However, that is not the
question now, and the point has been ruled on.
Se we have been deprived of reference to the
evidence, and really I am not in a position
to give a judgment on the merits of the case.
I sec there is a good deal of doubt about it.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Did you read the evidence
yourself?
Hon. Mr. COTE: I read parts of the evidence. For that reason I would urge that
the amendment of Senator Ballantyne be
adopted. Do not let this divorce petition
be killed by us to-night. Let it go to the
committee for reconsideration.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: My honourable
friend from Winnipeg said a little while ago
that the respondent said, "Never, never, never."
I challenge him to show one answer of 'Never"
that was given when she was being examined
by her own solicitor. The "Never" came in
when she was being cross-examined. Her
answers on direct examination were "Yes" or
"No," concise and plain.
Hon. Mr. ROBINSON: To refer the Bill
back to the committee is an effective way of
killing it. I think we had better settle the
question one way or the other.
lon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: The honourable
senator from Ottawa (Hon. Mr. Coté) says
that since he has been in this Chamber this
is the first time a divorce bill has been discussed and refused. The first session I attended
was ten years ago, and I myself objected to
a bill without quoting very mucb of the
evidcnce, and the Senate refused to give it
second reading.

Hon. Mr. MURD OCK: The woman involved
was, I think, the daughter of an officiai of
Birk's jewellery store in Montreal. That was
the difference.
Hon. Mr. COPP: Honourable senators, we
have spent a great deai- more time on this
case than either one of the participants
deserves.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. COPP: The motion is for the
second reading of this Bill. The motion of
my honourable friend from Aima (Hon. Mr.
Ballantyne) is really an amendment to the
motion. The only question now before the
House is whether we accept the motion for
second reading.
Hon. Mr. COTE: We are discussing the
motion for second reading.
Hon. Mr. COPP: Exactly.
Hon. Mr. COTÉ: The motion of the
honourable senator from Alma (Hon. Mr.
Ballantyne) is that the Bill be not now read
a second time, but he referred to the coinmittee for further consideration.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Rule 25 says:
No notice is required for any of the following
motions:
(a) By way of amendment to a question.
We have an amendinent Vo the motion for
second reading.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: Witlh the consent of my seconder, I will withdraw my
motion. Then we can decide on the motion
for second reading.
Hon. Mr. COPP: That is right.
The amendment was withdrawn.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: The question is
on the second reading of this Bill. Is it
your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt
the motion?
Some Hon. SENATORS:

Some Hon. SENATORS: Non-content.
The Hon.'the SPEAKER: In my opinion

The motion was agreed to, and the Bill

IPOOLING 0F BRITISH AND AMERICAN
PRODUCTION
REPLY TO INQUIRY

Hon. J. H. KING: Honourable senators,
ci ferring to the matter to which my honourable friend fromi Vancouver (Hon. Mr. McRae)
calld attention yesterday, I am now in a
lin!j

Mr.

KING,

position to reply to the inquiry which hie made
on June 12 and referred to again on July 27.
Bis inquiry related 10 an article appearing
in the Press te the effeel thal the United
Kingdom and the United States had pooled
their production resources and Ihat the pool
was to be administered by a representalive of
the United States and a representative of the
United Kingdom. According to my honourable friend, the report asserted that the represenlative of the United States was to have
charge of ail North American production,
including that of Canada.
This report rehated to the announcement
by President Roosevelt, on June 9, of the
creation of a Combined Production and
Resources Board and a Combined Food
Board. The scope of the Production and
Resources Board is indicated in the following quotation from a memorandum addressed
to Mr. Donald Nelson, the United States
membcr of the board, by the President:
Io order to complete the organization needed
foi, the mnost effective iîsc of the combined resonrcee of the United States and the United

Kingdo,îî for the prosecuition of the war, there
is hereby establislhed a Comnbined P'roduction
ani Resources IBoard1.
The memorandum goes on to describe the
functions of the board as: te "combine the
production programmes of the United States
and the United Kingdom into a single minegrated programme, adjusted to the strategic
requirenments of the war." The board iS instructed, in this connection, to take account
of the need for the maximum utilization of the
available resources in the United States, the
British Commonwealth and the United Nations,
and of ail other relevant factors.
My honourable fricnd wili note that the
board is to concern itself with integrating
the production programme of the United
States and the United Kingdom. As the Prime
Minister stated in reply to a question on
June 11, Canadian capacity has been expanded and developed in the chosest possible
co-operation with the United Kingdom and
with the United States. The Joint War Production Committc was estabhished hate in
1941 te perforrn, with respect te Canadian
and United States production, fonctions such
as thosc now undertaken wilh respect to United
States and United Kingdom production by
the new board. The representative of the
United States on this board bas net been
charged with any responsibility for Canadian
production. The creation of this board has
net led te aoy change in the arrangements
geverning the furnishing te the United Kingdom of supplies from Canada.
The Combined Food Board, which was
simultaneoctslvý
e..tablished, censists of the

385

JULY 30, 1942
UJnited States Secretary of Agriculture and the
head of the British Food Mission ini Washingdefined by President
ton. Its chief purpose, aÀs
Roosevelt, is "to co-ordinate further the prosecution of the war effort by obtaining a .planned
and expeditious utilization of the food resources of the United Nations." The relationship of Canada te this board is now the
subject of inter-governmental discussion. It
i.s clear, however, that the activities of the
board will not alter the procedure hitherto in
effect for the purchase by the United Kingdom
of Canadian food-stuffs. Ail such negotiations
will continue to be conducted between representatives of Canada and the United Kingdom.
My bonourable friend can rest assured that
it is nlot the intention of the Canadian G.vernment to hand over control of Canadian
production. The successful organisation of the
war effort of the United Nations, however,
requires the careful planning of production and
distribution on an inter-Allied basis, and the
new boards in Washington have been set up
by Mr. Roosevelt and Mr. Churchill in order
to fill gaps in the previous arrangements.
I think that covers my honourable friend's
inquiry.
At this time I should like also ta say to
the bonourable senator from West Central
Saskatchewan (Hon. Mr. Aseitine) in reply
to his inquiry with respect to the storage of
grain, that the matter has been and is being
considered by the Government. There will
be a very large carry-over which will have to
be stored. There is great dimâculty in securing
lumber for the construction of additional
storage facilities, and it Iooks as though the
surplus would probs.bly have to be stored on
the farms and be removed from time to time
as elevator capacity permits.
Hon. A. D. McRAE: Honourable senators,
I wish to thank the honourable leader of the
House for the explanation which he has given.
As I understand it, there is no change from
the procedure foliowed in the past with respect to the shipment of our products te
Great Britain. I have only one suggestion to
make ta the honourabie leader. I think it
would be well for us to be represented on
the boards he has mentioned, in order that our
interests might be protected at ail times.
Hon. Mr. KING: I believe some thought is
being given to that now.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: I would ask the
honourable leader of the House if any assistance wili be given to farmers for the provision
of storage. I mention this point because of
the fact that in some areas of the West, which
have not had a crop for a considerable time,
there is very-little storage space available, and
44567-25

ammIE

buildings will have to be erected. It seems
to me that even if farmers in these areas are
able to obtain lumber and other building
supplies, it will be necessary for the Government to provide some assistance to enable
them. to erect buildings. That is what I was
worrying about particularly yesterday.
Hon. Mr. KING: That phase of the question is being considered by the Government.

MOTION FOR THIRD READING POSTPONED

Third reading, Bill E4, an Act for the relief

H-on. Mr. MURDOCK: Honourable senators, I feel somewhat diffident about rising
to speak on this matter, but may I ask if I

what developed last night, before we proceed

suggestion? Carried. Postponed until tomorrow.
EXCESS PROFITS TAX BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. J. H. KING moved the second reading
of Bill 122, an Act ta amend the Excesa Profits
Tax Act, 1940.
He said: Honourable senatora, this Bill contains a number of amendments to the Excess
Profits Tax Act, 1940. It is probably well
known to hionourable members that the
Government bas followed the British idea, in
that although there is a tax of 100 per cent
on excess profits, the taxpayer will receive a
refund of 20 per cent of the amount of this
tax some time after the war.
Tbat is'the only statement I wish to make.
But I have asked my bonourable friend from
Wellington (Hon. Mr. Howard), who is
familiar with tbe mechanies and application
of the Act, if be would kindly give a further
explanation.

SENATE

Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE:
Before the
honourable senater from Wellington speaks,
may 1 peint out that while it is true that in
Great Britain excess profits are subject te
100 per cent tax, of whichi 20 per cent is refundable after the war, there is ne corporate
tax in that country. That makes a big
difference.
Hec. C. B. HOWARD: Heneurable senaters,
Isuppose evcryonc finds fauit with a fax
bill en general principles, but it seems te me
that a tax on excess prefits is prebably less
unpopuiar than any other. The principle of
this Bill is based on the estabilishment of what
is called a ý4tanulard profits period. The staîndard profits~ of a cerupainy or corperation are
determined by taking the profits for flic years
1936. 1937. 1938 and 19,39 ind î!iiidirg

And a corporation

impoecs a fax on flhc profits ef ail corporations up te $5,000 af the rate of 12 per cent.
pIeu, 18 per cent income fax. Companies with
profits in excess of $5.000 pay 12 per cent,
plus 18 per cent income fax, plus 10 per cent
of flic total profits, or 100 per cent of the
excess profits. whichever of the last fwo taxes
is the greafer. Companies whose profits are
lesu, than $5,000 do nef pay the 10 per cent
on their total profits, nor the 100 per cent
on their exuess profits.
I know that many honourable senafors on
reading this Bill will corne te the saine conclusion that I did, thaf some parts of if are
prefty bard te undersfand. Se I wi11 give a
cencrefe exampie te illusfrate hew these taxes

profits fax on flic $10.000, which would mean
another $1.200. or $3,000 in these two taxes.
Then if would pay eifber 10 per cent on the
$10.000 or 100 per cent on the excess profits,
whichever fax was the greater. In this case
the greater fax would be the 100 per cent
on the excess profits. That is, if would pay
100 per cent on the $5,000, less the 18 per
cent inceme fax and the 12 per cent excess
profits fax aiready taken, which wouid bring
this fax te $3.500. By adding $3,500 te $3,000
we find thaf a company with a standard of
$5,000 and a profit of $10.000 wouid pay $6.500
in taxes and bave left $3,500. or 70 per cent
of the standard profits.
Some bonourable senaters may ask, as bas
been asked already, "Wben dees the 100 per
cent excess profits tax appiy?"
If applies
wlien fhe taxable profits exceed the standard
profits by more fhan 16-66 per cent, or, in
other words, when the excess profits exceed
116-66 per cent. For example, let us take a
standard profit of $100 and a taxable profit of
$116.66. Af that point a fax of 10 per cent
on the total profits amounits te S11.66, exactly
flic samne as 100 per cent on cxcess profits.
Se the break-down peint on the new sehiedule
is exccss profits of 116-66 per cent.
I have fwo officiai documents liere. but I
think if is bardly necessary for me te read
them, as whaf I have said cevers flic scope
of the Bill. A question may be asked with
regard te page 2. Supposîng a company's
profit ivas $5,100. If '<ou fook 10 per cent of
fliat if would be $510, but subsection 2 of
new section 3 provides fliaf the profits shahl
nef be reduced beiow $5,000. Se in this case
'<ou would take off only $100.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE:
Would the
honourable senat or expiain the application of
the Bill wif b respect te depressed '<cars?
Hon. Mr. HOWARD: The question of a
dcpressed '<car in the standard fixation will
be subjeet te decision by the referees.
I
tbink the Minister may refer the matter te
bis referces or lie may make a decision himself.
Hon. Mr. BALLAN1-TYNE: ilear, hear.
Hon. Mr. HOWARD: In any case, the
verdict of flic referees is subjcct te the
Minisfer's apprevai.
Hon. Mr. JONES: The appeal would nef
go before flic Board of Referees.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: I arn afraid
that few companies are allowed te put their
case before flic referees. The Minister of
Finance takes a look at flic appeai and says
"e"and that ends if. I do nef mean he says
"No" alI the time, but very few cases get
before the Board of Referees.

JULY 30, 1942
Hon. Mr. HOWARD: The honourable
senator, being a business man, will know that
people usually hesitate to go to law, for fear
that if they lose their case they will have to
pay costs. But on appeals to the board in the
Income Tax Branch the taxpayer simply takes
the chance of winning or losing, because even
if he loses he will not have to pay any costs.
It is suggested that on that account the appeals
are more numerous than they would be if taxpayers were required to apply to the courts.
My impression is that if a company has a
just claim its appeal will not be turned down.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: Do I understand
the honourable gentleman to say that the
Excess Profits Tax Act as amended by this
Bill applies to corporations only? I am under
the impression it applies to individual businesses as well.
Hon. Mr. HOWARD: I did not deal with
that point. The amended Act does apply to
persons engaged in business individually or
in partnership.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: The honourable
senator from Wellington (Hon. Mr. Howard)
is quite right. I have been. associated with
business all my life, and I know corporations
that had gone to a good deal of trouble to
show their depressed-year claim, but were never
given a chance to present it. I think the
Board of Referees ought to hear all claims
that appear to be sound.
I should like the honourable senator to tel]
us something about the British corporation
tax. I mentioned a moment ago that the
people in England are better off than we are:
they have no corporation tax.
Hon. Mr. HOWARD: I am sure that if
the corporation could justify its claim the
Minister would refer it to the Board of
Referees. I am not familiar with the British
Act.
The honourable
Hon. Mr. LACASSE:
leader opposite is so conversant with these
matters that I should like, for my personal
information, to ask him a question, although
I may be out of order in doing so. I have
always been under the impression that the
British corporation income tax is based on
the principle of averages, and that the same
principle is applied in this Bill.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: I can give the
honourable senator the information, but I do
not know whether it is in order for me to
do so.
Hon. Mr. LACASSE: It is not, but I
should like to have that information.
44567-25à

Hon. Mr. KING: The Bill will stand for
third reading to-morrow, and I will see that
the necessary information is then available.
Hon. Mr. MARCOTTE: Will this Bill be
referred to the Banking and Commerce
Committee?
Hon. Mr. KING: I do not think it necessary, but, if desired, we can refer the Bill to
that committee this afternoon.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: I do not see that
any useful purpose would be served in referring
the Bill to the Banking and Commerce Committee, for, it being a money Bill, we cannot,
change it. I might say to my honourable
friend that I have in my desk upstairs a comparison between the income taxes of Canada
and England, and they are both pretty nuclk
the same.
Hon. Mr. HOWARD: I agree with the honourable gentleman that, this being a money
Bill, we cannot change it. I think the Bill
might be given second reading to-day.
Hon. Mr. MARCOTTE: I have no objection to that, but I desire some information.
Section 8 of the Bill relates to profits not
liable to tax. The amendment brings within
section 7 of the Act the profits of any corporation or joint stock company derived from the
operation of any base metal or strategicmineral mine which comes into production in
the three calendar years commencing the lst
day of January, 1943, but this exemption extends only to the income of the first three
fiscal periods of twelve months each commencing on or after the date of such mine
coming into production. That is about five or
six months from now. Suppose a mine comes
into production three months from now. The
company would be far better off to defer production until the lst of January. Base metalh
are essential to our war effort, and consequently the country would suffer by this postponement of production. But I see at the
bottom of the section these words: "The
Minister may make any regulations deemed
necessary towards carrying this paragraph (g).
into effect." Would this give the Minister
discretionary power to exempt the profits for
the next four months?
Hon. Mr. HOWARD: Yes. No matterwhere you establish the dividing line it isbound to work hardship in certain cases; so
the Minister is given discretionary powers.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: Let me point out
how this legislation affects the Western
farmer. I do not think anyone will say
the war has increased the price of wheat,
oats, and barley to the Western farmer,

3S8S

SERNATE

andi in some cases which have corne to
my attention the Act has worked a real bardship. In 1936, 1937, 1938 and 1939 in most
sections of Western Canada there was virtualiy no crop. The average yield for those
years was nlot sufficient even to enable the
farmer to supply the necessaries of life for
bimscîf and his family and pay anything on
bis debts, with the resuit that hie went badly
into the red. In 1940, we wiil say, bie bad a
big crop. I have in mind a man who is farming a couple of sections of land. H1e was
deeply in debt owing to bad crops. Last year
when hie came to me to make out his income
tax return I found hie bad to pay $10,000 excess
profits. Before coming to me hie had paid off
bis debts. In order to pay bis income tax bie
was obliged to mortgage ail bis holdings. That
is a great hardship. It has been said that
farmers do flot pay income tax, but in my
district there is not a farnier w-ho dops not pay
high income taxes every year. This year there
is a veî-y large crop. If, as a result, a farmer
has to pay 100 per cent excess profit tax, be
wiil nlot be able to pay the debts bie incurred
last year and other years when hie bad poor
crops. I desire to draw these facts to the
attention of the Government.

DOMINION SUCCESSION

DUTY BILL

SECOND READING

Hon. A. B. COPP moved the second reading
of Bill 123, an Act to amend the Dominion
Succession Duty Act.
H1e said: ilonourabie senators, the leader
of tbe House bas asked me to give a brief
explanation of this Bill, but ýowing to the sbort
time at my disposai I bave found it impossible
to compare the amendments in detail witb
the original Act.
As bonourabie members are aware, the
Dominion first entered the field of succession
duties in 1941, wben tbe Dominion Succession
Duty Act was passed. It is a long and intricate
Hou. Mr. ASELTINE.

uic asîi-c. andi tiiose enuted witIi adm inistering it bave found it necessary te ask for
the amendîîîents contained in this Bill for
purposes of clarification.
Tbis Bill w-as discussed at some lengtb in
tlîe otlier House yesterday. The original Act
wvas strongiy criticized on tbe ground tbat it
bas worked liardship bere and there, as ail
legisiation of this kind does.
Now for a brief expianation.
Section 1
changes the definition of a cbiid wbo succeeds
to an estate. Section 2 defines dutiabie value.
Clause 3 deais witli annuities, supenannuation
and pensions, and this arnendment is intended
to ciarify the law tbat superannuation benefits

or aliowances payable or granted to relatives
of a deceased person are dutiable. There are
severai other sections, which I need not deal
with in detail. Those bonotirabie senators
who are interested in the Act and tbis
aniending Bill ivili find it wortb wbiie to read
the discussion in the other House.

Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: I certainly bave
no objection te, the Biil, and I agree witb my
bonourable friend that it is a most difficuit
measure to understand. The essentiai amendment is in regard to grandcbildren. There is
no ailowance unless the grandciidITou1.

COPP

1- a ,eecei

Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: Yes. By anothier amendaient, if a man's superannuation
goes to bis widow it becomes hiable to
succession duty.
Hon. Mr. COPP: Yes.
Hon. Mr. COTE: Section 3 contains a
v-icieus pninciple. As extended by the amend-

ment, it covers an annuity payable on the
deatb, let us say, of the testator, to bis widow
or bis cbildren, notwitbstanding the fact tbat
hie may not be the one wbo bougbt the
annuity. H1e may bave contributed part of
the payment out of bis salary in order te
earn bis superannuation, but bis employer
may, as is very often the case, bave contributed the rest. Sureiy wben an employer
contributes to a superannuation fund wbicb
is for the benefit, flot only of the man, but
also of bis widow, it is a benefit wbicb passes

directly from the employer to the widow, and
not througb the husband to bis widow. I
tbink it is a novel and extraordinary means of
coilecting succession duties to, colleot a per-

centage on an amount wbicb neyer came from,
tbe deceased te tbe beneficiary, but came from.

an entirely

different source,

sucb

as tbe

employer in the case I bave mentioned.

389

JIJLY 30, 1942
I arn not opposed to succession duty taxes;
I think noliody is; they are necessary; but
when we are taxing succession, let us tax what
is actually succession, that is, an interest to
which somebody succeeda from the deceased.
Let us not rove all ever the field of taxation
and, under pretence of taxing succession, as
in this case, tax in reality an amount of
money which cornes from the employer, a
stranger to the widow of the decessed.
Hon. Mr. ROBINSON: There are several
succession duties levied at the present time.
For instance, estates have to pay succession
duty, flot only to the Dominion, but also in
many cases to more than one province. I
hope the Dominion Government will be able
te make such an arrangement with the provincial governments that persons handling
eatates wil have to deal with only one succession duty and flot have to spend a great
deal of time making up statements for three
or four succession duty departments. It would
be a great relief, I think, and a great help to
business generally, to have just one succession
duty.
Hon. Mr. COPP: May I say just a word in
reply to the honourable senator from Ottawa
East (Hon. Mr. Coté). I quite agree with his
suggestion. Various suggestions were made
also in the other House, and cases of extreme
difficulty were brought te the attention of the
Minister for consideration. The honourable
gentleman opposite has said he is not opposed
to succession duties. I arn not either, except
for the difficulty and the labour involved in
making out returns in compliance with the
law. I hope this Bill will clarify the Act so
that the preparation of returns will not be s0
difficuit in future.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was
read the second time.
THIRD READING

The Hon. the SPEAKER: When shail this
Bill be read a third time?
Hon. Mr. COPP: With the consent of the

SUSPENSION 0F RULES
MOTION

Hon. J. H. KING moved:
That Rules 23, 24 and 63 he suspended for
the remainder of the present session in so far
as they relate to public and private bills.
He said: Such a resolution as this is
custemary at this stage of the session, when
Parliament is about to adjourn or proregue,
and I think we had better follow the us.ual
practice.
Hon. JAMFS MURDOCK: Honourable
senaters, I arn under obligation to rny honourable leader for hringing this motion hefore
us. In fact I think I arn responsible for it,
because yesterday I advised him and His
Honour the Speaker and two or three others
that for the duration of this session I was
geing to insist on the application of the rules.
that is, a notice of two days for a second
reading and one day for a third reading. 1
believed when I took that position that .my
honourable leader would do, just what he bas
now done-propose a suspension cf these -rules
altogether.
Now we corne te a discussion on the question
of dispensing with Senate rules and regulatiens. The other night, as you know-and
please understand that I arn not particularly
complaining-I was told that the rules did
net permit me te bring before the Senate
certain evidence, which I thought net unimportant, in connection with the Taffert divorce
case, and it was then suggested that what I
was doing was in violation of the Criminal
Code. I was told that I eould not put anything of that kind on the record, and I regarded
it as rather peculiarThe Hon. the SPEAKER: Is the honourable senator speaking te a question of
privilege?
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: No; 1 arn speaking
on the motion te dispese of these three rules
for the remnainder of the session. The motien
that is befere the House is:
That Rules 23, 24 and 63 be suspended for

That is what I arn speaking te.

As I was saying, it was intimated the other
evening that it rnight bc in violation of the
Criminal Code. and in any case it was in
violation of the ruies of the Senate, to undertake to put on record any evidence in the

a rather peculiar one when in the report of

The Hon. the SPEAKER: If the honourable senator wilI keep his remnarks within that
limnit, there can he no objection. But his
remarks have been entirehy outside the
question.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: I arn endeavuuring
to deal with rules that have either been
ignored or are not known. That is what I am
trying to do. Whether I am making myseif
chear or not is another question. I said that

it is a rule-provides that a senator must-Hon. Mr. KING: I rise to a point of order,
Mr. Speaker. Rule 46 says:
Ail personal, sharp or taxing speeches are

My honourable friend cannot make personal
references, such as he is evidently about to
make.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: I do not want to
be personal or taxing. I arn referring to the
motion to expunge, which was made here the
other evening. and to a. very good friend of
mine who made it. And I wanted to give
my honourable leader and other honourable
senators an indication of what my views on
certain rules are. Have I a right to do that
now?
The Hon. the SPEAKER: I have ruled that
the honourable senator will be quite in order
if he restricts his remarks to tise motion,
which is for the suspension of Rules 23, 24
and 63. But hie is indulging in rernarks that
arc governed hy Rule 46, which says:
AUl personal, sharp or taxing speeches are
forbidden.
I hope the honourable gentleman will realize
that he is entirely out of order. and I ask
him to respect the ruling of the Chair.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Wcll, Your Honour.
of course I want to do that.

Then may I corne to the rules which
provide for the lnternal Economy Comrnittee
meeting?

Hon. Mr. KING: That can be deait with at
some other tirne. Let us restriet ourselves to
the rules mentioned in the motion.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: On March 26, when
my honourable leader was just new on the
job. he made a motion, and I pointed out
that under the ruhe the subjeet-matter of his
motion should have been referred to the
Internai Economy Cornrittee for consideration and report. Thereupon the honourable
gentleman said: "I have no objection to it
standing"; we could carry on as we had done
in the past.
There was something cIsc referred to at
that time.
Hon. Mr. KING: Order!

The Hon. the SPEAKER: I arn sorry, but
I must ask the honourable gentleman to
abide by the ruling of the Chair. If he is not
satisfied he has his remedy: he can appeal
fromn my ruling.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Your Honour knows
it is pure nonsense to try to do that.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: I cannot allow
the discuission to go any further. That is my
ruling.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: That means we
cannot bring out facts in this Senate.
Hon. Mr. KING: Question!
The motion was agreed to.
TAFFERT DIVORCE BILL
TIIIRD READING

Hon. W. M. ASELTINE moved the third

Williami Taffert.
Hon. JAMES MURDOCK: Your Honour,
should I be in order to refer to it?
The Hon. the SPEAKER: That is asking a
question.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: There is very littie
I can add to what I have already said. I was
prevented the night before hast from bringing
forward what I stili think would have been
definite evidence to confirmn my view that this
moral and decent woman, with her sixteenyear-old daughter, was being given a "ride"ýif that is what you may caîl it-by an admittedly perjured crook, for on his own evidence
he admitted that he was anything but a decent
man and had imposed on his wife's relations.
But when a motion is made for third reading
of the Bihl is really not the time to discuss the
case to any extent. I shahl therefore leave
the matter entirely in the hands of the Senate.
The motion was agreed to, on division, and

understood that it was flot proper to pass two
bills bearing the same titie during the same
session.
Hon. Mr. RING: I think in the circuinstances it is absolutely necessary that this
subsection be reinstated. The inadvertency
to, which I have referred was diseovered only
after the passage of the other bill mentioned
by the honourable member. A similar question was raised in the bouse of Commons, and
it was agreed that unless this subsection is
reinstated the purpose of the original Act is
nullified.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was
read the second time.

this Bill is for the purp ose of:
(a) Providing authority for the capital
expenditures of the railway system and the

Hon. Mr. ROBINSON: Louder.

Hon. Mr. COTE: Thank you.
Hon. Mr. GOUIN: The first heading dovers
the various items included in the amount
already mentioned, of $16,210,000.

You will find also figures for new equipment
purchases, amounting te $3,208,000. These are
analysed there with full particulars. And fin-

ally, on the second page of the breakdown,
you will find the detail of the acquisition of
securities, amounting ta $3,403,000.
Hon. Mr. COTE: Yes. May I pursue my
curiosity a littie further? In the breakdown of
816,210,000, which 1 now have in my hand, under
"General. additions and hetterments," 1 find
"Atlantic Region, $1,600,000; Central Region,
84,700,000; Western Region, 32,500,000"'ý

Hon. Mr. COTE: But we are not told what

these additions are. Are they additions te
track-additional steel that je heing laid, additional

niileage-or

are they additional

sta-

tions, or what?
Hon. Mr. GOUIN:

I have no further data

concerning these additions.
Hon. Mr. COPP: They are miscellaneous;
different things.
Hon. Mr. COTE: There is $16,000,000

of

miscellaneous, and I was curious to know
whether we are building more mileage or not.

SENATE

Hon. Mr. GOUIN: If the honourable
gentleman totals the additions and betterments he will come to the figure of $16,210,000.
As I remember, the figures on the sheet I
have just handed to my honourable friend are
not totalled. If he reads the items under
the heading of "General Additions and Betterments," he will have much more information

than is contained in the lump sum figure of
$16,000,000 which I have mentioned. That is
the only information which I am in a posi-

tion to give now, though, of course, I should
be quite willing to try to obtain any additional
information which my honourable friend does

not find in the sheets before him. I believe,
however, that in the figures he bas he will
find exactly the information he was asking
from me.

Hon. Mr. COTE: May I pursue my inquiry?
The honourable gentleman is right to a certain
extent in saying that I shall find information.
For instance, I find "Montreal terminals development, $1,900,000."
That conveys to me
the definite information that $1,900,000 was
spent on the Montreal terminals. When I
come to deal with the money spent on the
central region of the railways, $4,700,000, a
very substantial amount, I know that this
figure does not represent repairs, because they
are charged to operation.
Hon. Mr. KING: It is permanent improvement.
Hon. Mr. COTE: It represents permanent
improvements, but there is nothing to indicate
whether this figure is for the building of
stations in the central region, or the extension
of steel, or what it is. That is why I asked
for information as to the actual purpose for

which these large sums have been spent.
However, the information is not in the
statement, and I am not going to press the
matter any further.
Hon. Mr. KING: There is a great deal of
detail that one could place upon Hansard.
Hon. Mr. LACASSE: I should be delighted
to hear that the money was to be expended
on the building of stations in Windsoi- and
Tecumseh.
Hon. Mr. HORNER: Honourable senators,
possibly some of this money bas been spent
on small stations between Battleford and
Prince Albert, because crews have been working there all summer putting up steel-lath and
stucco. It seems to me that we were getting
along very well before, and that this work
could have been postponed until after the
war, and the men put to work on the construction of ships.
Hon. MI. COPP.

Hon. Mr. GOUIN:

Will my honourable

friend allow me to complete my general
explanation? I think it would be more in
order to proceed with the questions later.

In addition to the retirement of miscellaneous maturing obligations, the Bill also
provides authority for the purchasing and
refunding of any unmatured stocks, notes,
bonds, and so forth, of the Canadian National
Railway System. This purchasing and refunding can be donc either by way of loan
from the Dominion or by the issue by the
railway company of securities guaranteed by
the Dominion. This provision was inserted in
the 1940 and the 1941 Acts, but this year it
bas an enlarged scope. In the Acts adopted
in 1940 and 1941 it was provided that unmatured loans could be purchased only if neither
the capital of the debt shown in the latest
balance sheet of the system nor the annual
charge for interest was thereby increased.
These words are to be found in the last four
lines of section 3 of chapter 12 of the Act
assented to in 1941. This year those conditions are eliminated, and the proviso is
removed in order to let the railway company
make to the Canadian holders of sterling
Canadian National Railway securities an offer
similar to that which was made to the British
holders through the repatriation plan under the
War Appropriation (United Kingdom Financing) Act of 1942. It was felt that this offer
should be made to the Canadian holders, as
the great bulk of the issues were purchased
from British holders and the issues were
removed from the London stock exchange.
Certain of the issues, when converted into
Canadian dollars, were selling over par. In
the case of issues selling under par, provision bas already been made, under the
Financing and Guarantee Act of 1941, to
purchase securities from the Canadian holders.
I wish to say a word now concerning the
operating deficit.
Honourable members of
this House will remember that last year provision was made for temporary loans to the
railway company to cover the operating deficit
in the early part of the year. I think it will
be remarked with satisfaction that this year
no such provision is necessary, as this year the
railway has not at any time had an operating
deficit.
A word now about the pension funds. In
the Act adopted in 1941 it was necessary to
include a section-section 11, I think-to
authorize the Canadian National Railway Company to pay supplementary contributions to
the Intercolonial and Prince Edward Island

Railways' Provident Fund, and to the Grand
Trunk Railway Company of Canada Superannuation and Provident Fund. This provision is no longer necessary, because, in the

395

.1LLY 31, 1942
opinion of the Department of Justice, the
authority given ini 1041 is a continuing
authority.
I wish to add that the loans made from 1932
to 1937 have been repaid out of the proceeds
of Dominion-guaranteed railway issues. In
1938 the amount advanced was $10,737,216.07.
The 1938 advances have been repaid to the
extent of $9,019,207.17 out of the proceeds of
The
Dominion-guaranteed railway issues.
balance of the advances made under the 1938
Act, namely $1,718,008.90, bas been repaid
frocu the cash surplus of the Canadian National
Railways for the calendar year 1941. In 1939
the amourit advanced was $12,442,522.40. 0f
this ainount 81,110,409.29 has been repaid from
the cash surplus of the Canadian National
Railways for the last calendar year. The
balance of the outstanding advances, nameiy,
the balance for 1939 and the loans advanced in
1940 and 1941, which were $7b572,579.77 and
$11,943,000.29, respectively, totals $30,847,693.17.
These outstanding balances are carried on the
balance sheet of the Dominion as active assets
and the Canadian National pays interest
thex'eon.
In addition to the boans just mentioned, boans
have been miade also to the railway company
in the amouint of 3106,094,155.14 to provide
for the purchase of £22»92,025 of Grand Trunk

Finally, 1 wish to remark that up to June
15 loans aggregating 31,844,679.44 had been
made to the Canadian National Railways for
the purchase of sterling securities froma Canadian holders under the same ternis as those
made to the British holders.
I ask permission of the House to have placed
on Hansard a breakdown of the amount of
$9,795,000 whieh 1 menfioned as expenses for
retiring maturing capital obligations.

I think I have already given a sufficient
explanation of section 2; so I will now paso
on to section 3. This section is in the usual
language, with the difference that I have indicated, the elimination of the proviso:
If neither the capital of the debt as shown in
the latest balance sheet of the National Company nor the annual charge for interest is
thereby increased.
The only difference between section 4 and
the corresponding section of last year is in
the amount of advances authorized. Ail the

provisions which honourable senators will find
ia the 1941 Act.
Hon. Mr. PATERSON: With regard to the
refunding, may I ask the honourable senator

396

SENATE

if the idea is that the outstanding loans he
was referring to are to be refunded at a lower
rate of interest?
Hon. Mr. GOUIN: I have no information
on that point. But my impression is that
there would be some advantage in such
refunding.
Hon. L. COTE: Honourable senators, I am
sure there is no serious objection to this Bill,
and I am equally certain we all feel grateful
to the honourable senator from De Salaberry
(Hon. Mr. Gouin) for having given us a
complete and lucid explanation of the measure.
So far as the clauses of the Bill are concerned,
no one could have desired a fuller and cliearer
explanation than he has made, and within the
limits of the information given him with
regard to the breakdown of the figures, I think
he has done the very best that could be done.
My questions about certain items of capital
expenditure were not prompted by a desire
to object to our Canadian National Railways
spending money on capital extensions, but I
take the view, as I expressed it the other
day when the honourable senator from Saint
John (Hon. Mr. Foster) spoke on the company's balance sheet, that from now on the
management should limit capital expenditures
to what is absolutely essential. I think we
all hope the management will do that. Unfortunately capital expenditures must be financed
by borrowings, on which interest has to be
paid. I trust the railways will not fall on
such evil days as they have known in the past,
but I am afraid they will not always find
times as good as at present; and when poorer

able friend from Ottawa East (Hon. Mr.
Coté) rightly said the expenditures for the
central region-which I believe includes the
section I represent-did not cover repairs; so
I take it for granted the intention is to erect
some new buildings, perhaps stations or something in that line. I said I should like to
see a new station at Windsor. Well, Windsor is one of the most important railway
terminals in Canada. I take it for granted
that all the moneys making up that total of
more than $4,000,O0 have already been earmarked by the Canadian National management, but if it is not too late to do so I plead
with them to allot a certain sum for Windsor.
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. LACASSE: I welcome the honourable gentleman's support. A few years
ago the station at Windsor suffered from a
very bad fire. I am not trying to make a
joke when I say that the firemen did such a
good job that they saved the station, but lost
their local popularity by doing so. We
should have preferred the fire to wipe out the
station and force the Canadian National Railways to put up a new building. Hamilton
and London have been favoured with splendid
new stations, and I do not think either of

to the interest on these borrowings, and
must be provided for out of taxation. Heaven
knows we shall have enough taxation in any
event after we are through with the job of
winning the war. My chief purpose in asking
for the information was to provide myself
with an opportunity to express this view, and
also to impress on the management of the

Hon. A. L. BEAUBIEN: Page Mr. Pouliot.
Hon. Mr. LACASSE: The ýpresent station
at Windsor is a disgrace. I might add that
this is true of it not only as a railway station,
but also from the point of view of sanitary
conditions.* I am not suggesting that the

Canadian National Railways the expediency
of furnishing, when requesting authorization
of Parliament for capital expenditures, less
meagre details than we have been given
to-day. To refer to capital extensions simply
as "general additions" is too indefinite. It
would be a simple matter to be more specific
by giving sub-headings to indicate the nature
of at least the more important projects.
Hon. GUSTAVE LACASSE:

senators, a little while ago I made a remark
which may have soinded more or less like a

joke, but I ask your permission to corne back

I wish to avail myself of this opportunity,

from Ottawa (Hon. Mr. Lambert), to plead

National Railways that in their generosity
they will not forget the city of Windsor.

management make large capital expenditures
in general just now, but I urge that if any
new buildings are to be erected anywhere the
city of Windsor be not overlooked, and that
the disgraceful station there be replaced.

Hon. Mr. COTE:

I know I am out of

order in rising again, but perhaps I shall be

permitted to add just this remark.

I think

it is within the knowledge of us all that an
honourable member of another place has succeeded in obtaining a new railway station at

a place called Rivière du Loup.

Hon. Mr. LITTLE: I shauld like to point

Raiiway station in London. I wouid suggest
that if thase in contrai of the finances in the

Hon. Mr. LACASSE:

Hon. N. M. PATERSON: Hanourabie
senators, the items under the heading of
additions and betterments ta the Canadian
National Railways system remind me that I
read very recentiy that the Canadian Pacific
Railway Company was providing a much larger
sumn for its extensions and improvements.
Anyone who has travelled. iately, as most
of us have, wiil have nloticed the tremendous
increase in bath passenger and freight trafflo.
Honourabie members are aware how difficuit it is ta get into and out of the Union
station during train times. I sincereiy hope
that in the total mentioned sufficient funda are
provided ta finish the station in Montreal.
The last time I went through Bonaventure
station I and forty other persans loat aur
baggage just because of the terrific rush of
travel and the resuitant confusion in the
craniped space. The city of Montreal has
outgrown the faciiities of Bonaventure station,
and to-day they are aItogether inadequate ta
handIe the enormousiy increased passenger
traffic. The new depôt wiil serve a very good
purpose if it provides at ieast comfortabie
accommodation for the travelling pubic.
I shouid like ta caii the attention of the
honourabie senator ta the rail extensions
required for war purposes. New factories and
new airfieids have necessitated raiiway extensions in order ta handie itraffic ecanomicaiiy
and quickiy. I think these expenditures are
very inoderate, considering the enormous
growth af raiiway business throughout
Canada.
By the way, honourabie senators, I hope
sincereiy, that for the sake of national unity
the appropriation for additions and betterments includes sufficient funds ta provide for
a new ferry at Summersidel

You corne to us, sir, directly frorn the

You have had a long and interesting career in

deliberations.
You will find that our rules and, procedure
are somewhat different from those of the
Bouse of Commons. As a body we are fairly
liberal ini their interpretation; indeedý, sornetimes we even transgress them. I would suggest that before applying the whip, or
disciplinary measures, you should at least
absorb a littie of the atmosphere of this
Chamber. I assure you that in d-ischarging
the duties of your high office you will receive
the loyal support and full co-operation, of ail
your colleagues.
Bon. C. C. BALLANTYNE: Bonourable

every honourable senator on this side of the
Bouse when I j oin with the honourable Leader
and -those on the other aide in offering to, Your
Honour our very warrnest congratulations.
You are especially qualified to be the Speaker
of the Senate of Canada: you are an experienced parliarnentarian, a brilliant lawyer and
a cultured gentleman, and you have a Vhorough
rnastery of both officiai languages.
I wish
Your Honour good health.
There is one thing of whieh you can be
perfectly sure, and that is that you will have
the united and loyal support of ail honourable
senators in the discharge of your duties.
Knowing you as I do, I arn confident that
those duties will be carried out efficiently and
always in a fair and dignified manner.

SPEECH FROM THE THRONE

The Honourable Thibaudesu Rinfret, the
Deputy of the Governor General, having corne
and being seated at the foot of the Throne,
and the Bouse of Cornrons being corne wîth
their Speaker, the Bonourable the Deputy of
the Governor General was pleased. to close the
Third Session of the Nineteenth Parliarnent
of the Dominion of Canada with t'he following
speech:
Honourable Members of the Senate:
Members of the Bouse of Commons:
The present session opened under the shadow
of the rapid successes of Japanese aggression
in the Far East. Germany and Italy, in rnaking
wçar upon the United States, had completed the
circle of world-wide confiict. With German
advances in North Africa snd Russie, and
Japanese advances in China and toward India
and Australia, the shadows Ieiigthened. In the
late summer, the midnight hour seemed to have
arrived.
The British successes in North Africa in
October, followed by the landing of a United
States and British expeditionary force in
November, cornpletely changed the course of the
war in that area. These surcesses, cornbined
with the determined resistance of China, the
unparalleled achievements of the arrned forces
of Russia, and the United States and Australian
gains in the south-west Pacifie, have materially
irnproved the position of the Allied powers.
Opposing forces are et lest more evenly matched.
The United Nations are beginning to wage
offensive warf are.

402

SENATE

The fighting men of Canada, in increasing
numbers, have continued in service and in
combat against the Axis powers in Europe, in
Africa, in the Middle East, on all the oceans
and in the farthest parts of an embattled world.
They have kept vigil over our own shores, both
west and east. The valour and heroism displayed in the combined operations at Dieppe
have added that name to the imperishable list
of the battle honours of Canada.
Our country gratefully remembers those in
all the fighting forces and in all parts of the
world, whose lives have been given in its service
and in the cause of freedom.
There bas been increased co-operation between
the United States and Canada in the defence
of the Western Hemisphere. Canadian and
United States forces have shared operations in
Alaska and the Aleutians, as they previously
had in Newfoundland, along our eastern coast,
and in the north Atlantic. The chain of military
airfields constructed by Canada between the
United States and Alaska bas been supplemented by the military highway constructed
by the United States. There bas also been
co-operative development of northern air routes
to Europe and Asia.
A plebiscite was held in accordance with
legislation forecast in my speech at the opening
of the session. As a consequence of the plebiscite, the National Resources Mobilization Act
was amended to remove the statutory limitation
on compulsory service in the armed forces.
A balanced effort in the prosecution of the
war has resulted in a steady increase in the
proportion of the nation's manpower and material resources devoted to the purposes of war.
The armed forces have grown steadily in numbers, in strength and in traincd efficiency. The
production of the machines and munitions of
-ar and of food-stuffs has risen to new heights.
In addition to supplying our own forces, Canada
bas made a vast direct material contribution of
weapons, munitions and food-stuffs to Britain
and other of the United Nations. Within the
limits of available manpower and materials, our
munitions programme bas now reached full
capacity. The volume and quality of output
compare favourably with those of any Allied
country.

Canada's production is being vigorously sustained by unremitting Mork on our farms, and
in the forests, mines and fisheries, the factories,
shops and offices, and in all forms of transport.
In the armed forces and in industry, the wiomen
of Canada are taking an increasing part.
Measures have been enacted to provide for
the reinstatement in civil employment of meinbers of the armed forces, and to assist war
veterans to settle upon the land.
Rates of pay for lower ranks in the Army
have been increased on a basis of recognition of
service and efficiency. Increased provision bas
been made for allowances to dependents of those
serving in the armed forces.
The control of the cost of living bas been

required, more equitable distribution of
Where
the necessaries of life bas been ensured by the
rationing of supplies to consumers.
Measures have been taken to curtail the production and consumption of alcoholic beverages.
Provision bas been made for war risk insurance and for compensation for war damage.
Members of the House of Comnons:
I thank you for the financial appropriations
you have made for the proseculion of the war.
The magnitude of these appropriations is without precedent.
As a result of the conclusion of agreements
with the provinces, the structure of taxation bas
been simplified. By a combination of steeply
progressive taxation and compulsory savings, the
financial burdens of war have been spread more
equitably over the whole population. The magnificent voluntary responses to the two Victory
Loans raised during the present session were
deeply gratifying.
Honourable Members of the Senate:
Members of the House of Commons:
I thank you for the close attention you have
given, in these perilous times, to the discharge
of your public duties.
I join with you in grateful thanks to Divine
Providence for the measure of success which has
thus far attended the efforts of the United
Nations.
