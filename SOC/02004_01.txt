was pleased to open the Fourth Session of the
Twentieth Parliament of Canada with the
following speech:
bonourable Mombors of the Sonate:
Members of the House of C3ommons:
Conditions tbroughout the world continue to

over large areas, active figbting continues.
Shortages of tbe necessities of if e, particnlarly
of f ood, are still acute. In many countries,
political and social unrest is serions. Failure
to agree on peace settlements with Germany and
Austria is preventing tbe recovery of Europe.
Canada was recently reprosented nt a meeting

in the Pacific were discnssed ln an explora-

tory maniner. The government has welcomed
the initiative of -the United States ini propo6ing
an early conference on the pe-ace .treaty witb
Japan.
The Canadian delegation to the General
Assembly of the United Nations took an active
part in its proceedings. Canada was eleoted to
a seat on the ISecurity Counicil. Canada was
also represented on the United Nations ISpecial
Committee on Palestine. Support of the charter
of the United Nations remailla an essential
feature ef Can'ada's -foreign policy.
While unsettled conditions stili prevail in
Europe and Asia, Canada has continued to

enjoy general prosperity.
national income have reached levels neyer before
attained. Our country 'has not been unaffected,
however, by the problemns and difficulties of
other counitries. LMany nations 'witýh which we
trade have been unable to restore their full
productive capacity. Their consequent inability
to increase îbheir exports in sufficient measure
to pay for their imports bas greatly complicated
Canada's .foreign exclbange position.
A permanent solution of our exehange problems and the future well-being of the nation
depend upon -the revival of world trade. An
important step forward in this direction 'has
been the snccessful conclusion of the recent
discussions at Geneva. A positive achievement
was the conclusion of trade agreements with
eighteen other nations. You will be asked to
approve these agreemen-ts. Canada is now represented at -the United Nations Trade Conferonce in Havana, whîch it is hoped will resuIt
in the establ-ishment of an international trade
organization along linos agreed to at Geneva.
The trade agreements and the establishment of
an international trade organizatian will provide
a sound founidation -for the expansion of world
commerce, production and employment.
Provision of a tomporary ebaracter has been
made to conserve and supplement Canadas reserves of U.nited States dollars., The measures
recently announced to deal wîth the various
aspects of the immediate foreign exchange difficulty will be submitted for yonr approval.
The present shortage of United iStates dollars
will necessarily limait Canada's capacity to
render further economic assistance to other
counitries. Canada, novertbeless, remaine one of

any other country. In the effort to, further the
great task of warld recovery, Canada will continue, so f ar as is possible, to apply the principle' of mutual assistance. Furtber assistance
must, however, take into accounit the oxcbange
difficulties wbich bave arisen.

ROBERTSON:

Bonourable senators, ýit becomes my duty to
offlcially notify this bouse that since we last
met we have iost, by death, four of our colleagues, men who occupied a very prominent
position in the councils and deliberations of
this bonourabie body. Their passing, 1 feel,
wili be mourned by us ail.
The Honourable Gerald Grattan McGeer,
.Cwas born on January 6, 1888, at Winnipeg, the son of James McGeer and Emily
Cooke. Bis fat-her was of Irish origin, and, bis
mother was English. Be receîved his eariy
education in Vancouver. In bis youth he sold
papers, delivered miik, and worked as an iron
mouider. Having a passionate desire for education, he saved enough out of these activities

to study iaw at Dalhousie University in Nova
Scotia. On graduation he returned to British
Columbia and was admitted to the Bar of that
province in 1915. In the general eiection of
1916, at the age of 28 he was eiected to the
British Columbia Legislature.. On November
29, 1917, he married Charlotte Spencer, daughter of David Spencer of Victoria, B.C. He had
two children: Patricia Anne and Michael
Grattan Spencer. In 1922 he was appointed
King's Counsei.
Senator McGeer took a keen interest in
economic and financiai probiems. Be wrote
many articles on banking, currency and credit,
and a book entitied The Conquest of Poverty.
In 1933 he was again eiected to the British
Columbia Legisiature. Shortiy afterwards be
entered civie polities in Vancouver, and was
elected mayor for the term 1935-36. Perhaps
bis most notable achievement as mayor was
the erection of Vancouver's fine new city bail.
During Vancouver~s Golden Jubiiee anniversary celebration be received the Lord Mayor
of London and the Lady Mayoress, who presented the city of Vancouver with a replica
of the famous mace of the city of London.
The late senator MeGeer resigned from the
legisiature to accept nomination in the general
election of 1935, and was eiected to the Bouse
of Commons. He was re-eiected in the generai
election of 1940. On June 9, 1945, he was
summoned to the Senate and, as honourabie
members will recali, piayed a very active part
in our deliberations. On August 11, 1947. after
severai months of faiiing heaith and having
undergone a serious operation, he passed away.

SENATE

While Senator McGeer was; fot a member
of the Senâte for as long as some others wbom
we mourn today. hie made an outstanding contribution bere. It seems to me t-hat thc greatest tribute that was paid to him was sometbing
that 1 read about in a Vancouver newspapcr.
As bis funeral cortege passed throughi the
streets of Vancouver tbouýands upon thousands
of people, some of tbem in the most lowly circumstances, stood with boîved Iieads, visibly
affected by the passing of one wbomn tbcy considered a friend. I remember that once in
No-a Scotian bistory someone said that tbe
greatest tribute that could be paid to a man
ivas the reý,pect of those wbio bad known. him
bcst and longest
The Honourable William James ilarmer was
born on October 16, 1872, tbe son of James
Harmer and Agatba Walker. He received bis
early education in Napanc, Ontario.
H1e
became a telegrapher and Ment west in 1891,
where bie was engaged in railway operating and
traffic departments, and in telephione managcment. For tlîree years he served as Superintendent of Operation of the Alberta Governm 'nt Telephione System, and wben tbe governiment of the province created a Department
of Railways and Telephones lie became Deputy
Minitcr, ini which office hie served until bis
appoint ment to the Sonate on February 5,
1918. He passed away on September 9, 1947.
As honourable senators know, lie was one of
tbe senior members of this bouse. Hie did flot
oftcn participate in our dcbatcs, but lie faithfully fulfilled bis duties and responsibilities as
a rcgular attendant at tbe sittings of the house
and its comnmittees. 1 am sure tbat tboýe who
bave so long looked upon bim as a familiar
figure here will feel tbat with bis passing wve
bave 1ost one of our most outstanding memlbers.
Tbe Honourable W'alter Edward Foster. P.C.,
LL.D., was born at St. Martins, New Brouswîck, on April 9, 1874. His parents weî'e
Edxvard H. Foster and Elizabetb Pattison
Fos-ter. Hie attended puiblic and grammar
scbools in Saint Jobn, acd in 1889 entcred the
service of the B3ank of New Brunszwick. Ten
years later lie became a member of tîte fiim
of Vaýý:sie & Company, whole>,ale dry goods
mcccli aîýs in Saint John. In 1900 bie mnarried
Johan Mary Vassie, tbe daughiter of William
Vassie.
S'enator Foster's interests and activitics were
numierous. He served as an officer in the New
Brunswiîck Regiment of the Cýn.adian Artillerv', retiring in 1903 witb tbe rank of captain.
In 1906 acd 1907 lie v~as Vice-Pr '.ident of tbe
Saint John Board of l'rade. HE twice servrd
as arbitrator in labour disputes in tbe Port of

Saint Jobn, and on botb occasions ivas successfui in adjusting tbe differences and securing
agreement.
In 1916 bie entered politics as leader of tbe
Liberal party in opposition in New Brunswick.
In 1917 bis party was elected to office, and on
April 4 cf that year bie assumed the premiersbip cf bis province. At tbe general election
of 1920 lie was again elected to represent Saint
John. On February 1, 1923 Senator Foster
resigned tbe premiership to become a member
cf tie adi iscry board for tbe St. LawrenceGreat Lakes *Waterway, and in 1927 became
chairuian cf tbis board.
Meanwbile, in 1925,
lie was appcinted a member cf tbe Privy Council, acd Secretary cf State in Mr. Mackenzie
King's Cabinet, but was, defcated in tbe general electiion hcld in tbe samie year. Hie was
appointcd to tbe Senate on December 5, 1928.
acd bc.îue its Speaker in 1936.
Tbe late Senator is survived by bis widow
and tbree daugbters. Bis only son, Captain
Walter W. V. Foster, dicd in 1944 wbile serving witbi tbe Canadian Army overseas. Senator
Foster bimself passed away on November 14
of tbis year.
1 am sure it, will in ne way reflect upon the
memory cf tbe otber two boncurable senators
te wbom I bave referred, if I .av thiat my
personal relationsbiîî witb tbe laie Senator
Foster was very close indeed.
Wbetlicr it
w\as because bie was a fellow Maritiîner, or
tbat I appreciated and came under the
influîencýý cf bis cbarm of personality, bis
intcgrity and good judgment in matters cf
public office, I do net know; but I do feel tbiat
in bis passing I bave lost one cf my best
friends.
On ycur bebiaîf, as well as my own,I
attcnded tbe funeral ceremonies wbicb teck
place in tbe beautiful cemetery betwcen
Rotbcsay and Saint Jobn, and tbere paid my
last, respects te a great Canadian.
Honeurable
senators, witbi mcst. tragic
sudtlenncss deatb bas removed anotber cf cur
colleagues. We fcel it inevitable tbat witb
tbe efflux cf time members of advanced y cars
muist sooncr or later be remcved from our
micdst; but I am sure tbe news cf the d-eatb
tbis miorning of the Honourable Jobn Joseph
Bencb, K.C., came as a tremendeus sbock to
evervonie witbin tbis cbamber and tc many
people otside.
Senator Bencb M'as hemn in 1905 at St.
Catharines, Ontario. Hie was admitted to tbe
Ontario Bar in 1928 and was created a King's
Couinsel in 1W37. Tbe late senator wvas a
retired officer cf tbe Lincoln and Wclland Regiment, former cbairman cf the St. Catbarines
Separate School Board. and former presideîît
cf the St. Catharines Cbamber cf Commerce.

DECEMBER 9, 1947
H1e was, as bonourable members will recaîl, a
member of the National War Labour Board in
1943. H1e had been a candidate for the flouse
of Commons in tbe general election of 1940,
and was summoned to tbe Senate on November 19, 1942, wben he was tbirty-seven years
of age. At tbat time, and until bis death at
the age of forty-two, be was the youngest
senator.
I do not knowv tbat I can add very much ta
the knowledge of honourable senators, wbo
knew him sa well. For myself, I was proud
to count bim as a friend. H1e was a familiar
figure in our deliberations, intenscly interested
in making bis contribution to public life, and
jealous of the good reputation of this
bonourable body. H1e did m.uch ta inform
those wbo were interested as ta, the place
wbich tbe Senate holds in the government of
the country. It seems ta me a tragic circumstance, one wbicb is difficult ta explain, that
a career whicb beld so much promise should
end so prematurely. All we can do, and I
desire so, ta do in tbe light of the position
I bold, is ta extend ta his widow and ta bis
infant daugbter very sincere sympatby in tbe
great sarrow whieh bas befallen tbem, and
ta assure tbem that tbey are nat alone in
tbeir grief, but that this body and the country
as a wbole realizes that Canada has lost a
brilliant and autstanding son.
Hon. JOHN T. HAIG: Honourable members, in following tbe government leader it
is not my intention ta allude in detail to the
life histories of the men ta wbom be bas
referred. I took a few notes, bowever, s0 that,
wbile not delaying tbe bouse, I migbt fittingly
express by personal feelings.
The Honourable Gerald G. McGeer, K.C.,
known ta most of the people of Canada as
"Gerry Me-Geer", was barn in miy borne city
of Winnipeg in January, 1888. 11e was a
rnember ot the Bar of Britisb Columbia, a
member for sorne years of the British
Columbia Legislature, twice mayar of Vancouver, for ýten years a member of the flouse
of Commons, and since 1945 a member of
this ebamber. H1e was married, and leaves
a wife and two cbildren.
The late senatar bas often been referred ta
as the stormy petrel of British Columbia
polities. 0f Irish nationality, be early showed
an interest in tbe under-dog; and all bis
reactions ta any problem affecting public life
were infiuenced by bis concern for tbe downtrodden. Wbether or not anc agreed with
bis political philosophies, anc bad ta admire
tbe ability and tenacity witb whicb be supported bis cause. A bonny fighter, hie will be
rnissed not only in bis adopted rrovince of

Bri.tish Columbia but throughout Canada.
As a member of this chamber, rnay I say
that Gerry McGeers, whether we agree with
them or flot, are a good. thing for Canada.
The late senator will be sorely missed in this
hnqise, if for no other reson than that be kept
us "on aur toes", tbinking about wbat we
ough't to do.
The Honourable William J. Harmer, as the
leader of the government bas said, was one
of the senior members of this bouse, having
been appointed to the Senate by the Union
Government in Feibruary, 1918. By vocation
a railroad telegrapher, for some time be was
an operator on one of the lines of the Canadian Pacific Railway in Alberta, the province
which he adopted as bis borne. H1e subsequently became Deputy 'Minister of the
Department of Telephones. and remnained
witb ýthat department of government for some
years until bis appointment to the Senate.
Senator Harmer took little part in our
deliberations bere, but be could always be
counted upon to be in bis place in tbis cbamber, and faithfully attended ahl committees of
which be was a member.
Tbe Honourable Walter E. Foster. P.C..
LL.D., wbo was a native of the province of
New Brunswick, rendered great service ta bis
own province, first as a businessman, later as
a member of the provincial legisiature, and
finally of this chamber. In 1925 he was
appointed a member of the government
of the Rigbt Honourable W. L. Mackenzie
King, but was defeated in the gencral election
of tbat year, and came to the Senate in 1928,
and was Speaker of tbis house from January
1936 until May 1940. 11e was beloved not
only by the members on bis own side of tbe
bouse but by those in every part of this
cbamber. H1e wvas tbe first Speaker 1 bad
tbe hionour to sit under in this bouse, and I
always feit especially friendly towards bim
because on many occasions be belped out tbe
new members by bis good-bumoured assistance.
Senator Foster was indeed happy in bis
home relations, but tbe bass of a son in tbe
last war seemed to cast a shadow over bis
declining years. I bad the pleasure of knowing bis wife and one of bis daugbters wbo was
principal of a, scbool for girls tbat two of
my daughters attended. We ail thougbt a
great deal of ber. To her, to ber motber and
the other members of tbe family, 1 extcnd
sincere sympatby in their sad bereavement.
May there in future be many more appointed
to this ebamber who will bring to it sucb credit
and bonour as did Senator Foster.
It is a little difficuit to speak of tbe late
Senator Bencb-his caîl bas been Eo recent

SENATE

and so sudden-but I Leedthat today I shouid
like to do honour to hjm as weil as to the
others.
The Honourable John Joseph Bench, K.C..
or "Joe" as we ail knew him, wvas ;the youngest
member of this bouse. H1e came here in
November, five years ago, and bais brilliant
mind soon impressed itself on ail of us. 11e
was flot only a good lawyer but a clear thinker
whose word was as good as bis bond. He was
very able flot only in formai debate in the
chamber, but in the discussions before comnmittees of this house. We wiiI soreiy miss
his great abiiity, of whicb hie gave so freely
for the bonefit of legisiation and tbe good of
Canada as a whole. We could iii spare a
young man of forty-two from the councils of
the nation, and bis passing wiil be a loss, flot
oniy to the people of Ontario, whorm he represented, but to ail the people of Canada. Our
sincere sympathy goes out ta bis youing wife
and baby daughter.
I just wisb to say one more word with
respect to Senator Bench. It very rareiy
bappens that lawyers can interpret logai matters to a layman so that the latter can understand them as tbough he too were a lawyer
and trained in the law. "Joe" Bencb had that
characteristic.
Another priceless characteristic that bie possessed wvas that bis word was
as good as bis bond. Sometimes it was
difficult to get him ta came to a conclusion
an a point -of law or an argument; but when
bie did yuu cuuld depend that hie was giving
you bis very hest and considered opinion.
I wish ta pay my very great respect ta
theso four mon wbo, wbile representing different parts of Canada, at the samie time reprosented every class of society in the Dominion.
Hon. A. B. COPP: Honourablo senators, I
desire ta add a word or two ta the very
apprapriate tributes that bave been paid ta
the members of this chamber who bave passed
away sinco wo last met. At the saine time,
I feel it more incumbent upon me ta say a
fcw words about my personal friend and calbeague from New Brunswick, the late Senator
Foster.
I had knawn Sonator Foster very intimately
foir the past tbirty-five years. I first met him
in Saint John wlien hoe became a candidate of
tive party of which I 'vas then
the leader.'
From that time on w'.e wcre very closeiy assocîated i11 a business, political and social way.
As hias already heen sa weli said, hoe was
an outstanding man in the community where
he livcd. 11e was deeply interested in business and for many years carried on a prosperous business in the city of Saint John, and
as our leader (Hon. Mr. Robertson) lias said.
lie was elccted ta the office of the premier of

New Brunswick. As a mnatter of fact, on the
last occasion that I appealed ta the people
of that province they decided that I should
hie bonourably discbarged, and when I came
ta Ottawa in 1915 the late Senator Foster
succeeded me thora as the leader of the party.
Senator Foster piayed a prominent part in
ail walks -of life in his native province. As the
bonourable leaders of bath sides bave so capahly said, bis gentlemaniy instincts were outstanding. H1e occupied the prominent position
of Speaker of this chamber most acceptably,
as we ail know, and I am sure we shall always
bold bis memary in the higbest regard and
the deepest affection.
I was nýot completely takon by surprise when
I beard of bis passing a few weeks ago. During
the iast year or two I had known that bais
liealtb was not as robust as it should bave
been. Hie bias gone away witb others; and I
wanýt ta jain witb our leaders in offering my
mosgt heartfellt sympathy ta bis widow and
family in their irreparable bass.
I might say just one mare word in regard
ta 'the sudden de-atb of aur young friend,
Senator Bencb, who passed away today. He
came bore a few years ago and showod an
intense interest in the work of the Sonate.
He was a very faithfui attendant, noýt oniy
in this chamber but in the committeeýs, wbere
hoe vas very useful and gave a great doal of
information. His untimeiy passing only goos
ta show that the oid saying is truc: "The
yaung may die; the aid must die". llowever,

t0 Vour Excellency for tbe gracions speech
which Your Excellency has addressed f0 both
houses of parliament.
He said (Translation):

marked by a new ftrend of Canada's economy.
This bouse wiIl have f0 ratify tbe Geneva

well as by the inflation from whieh its main
supplier. tie United States, is now suffering.
It will also be called upon to ratify a comprehensive program of economie liberation,
entailing the application of coercive measures
that will be quite hard on the Canadian subsidiaries of big American companies, and
which also involve a resort to various means
with a view to encouraging the development
of this country's natural resources.
The Speech from the Throne summarizes the
chief measures which the government wishes
to submit for the approval of parliament
during this session. This program relates to
the doestic as well as the foreign policy of
Canada.
The Speech from the Throne reviews the
world situation and it emphasizes the important part played by Canada at the General
Assembly of the United Nations, where this
country has obtained by election a seat on the
Security Council.
Canada was also represented on the United
Nations special committee on Palestine, and
support of the United Nations Charter remains
an essential feature of Canada's foreign policy,
in the spirit of the Speech from the Throne.
It seems that the most considerable contribution of Canada and the nations engaged in
the planning of peace and prosperity on a
world-wide economic basis, is the signing by
Canada and eighteen other nations of the
general agreement on customs tariffs and trade,
known as the Geneva agreements, which involves negotiations for the substantial reduction of customs tariffs and other trade barriers,
and the elimination of preferences on a basis
of reciprocity and mutual advantage.
The speech from the throne strikinglv
empbaizes the general prosperity in Canada
and the hardships suffered in other countries.
Conditions throughout the world continue to
be difficult and disturbing. The dislocations
resulting from the ravages of war have become
increasmîgly apparent. In Asia active fighting
continues over large areas. Shortages of the
necessities of life, partieularly of food, are still
acute. In many countries, political and social
unrest is serious. Failure to agree on peace
settlements with German.v and Austria is prevenlting the recovery of Europe . . .
While unsettled conditions still prevail in
Europe and Asia, Canada lias continued to
enjoy general prosperity.
Enployment and
national ineome have reacbed levels never
before attained. We have not been unaffected.
however, by the problems and difficulties of
other countries.
Our government is fully aware of the fact
that an international trade organization is

necessary in Canada, because she has experienced the prosperity resulting from her exports, which reached a considerable figure last
year.
Canada is represented at the United Nations
trade conference now being held in Havana,
which it is hoped will result in the establishment of an international trade organization
aiong lines agreed to at Geneva. The trade
agreement and the establishment of an international trade organization will provide a
sound foundation for the expansion of world
commerce, production and employment.
In the international sphere, does not Canada
occupy an enviable position?
While this
nation lives in abundance, millions of human
beings in the over-populated and underfed
countries of Europe and Asia are clamouring
for food. Canada is in duty bound to make
her share of sacrifices in order to help save
Europe from ruin.
Canada must help as much as she can in
the restoration of Europe. It is to her interest
that she should do so. This country will
never be self-sufficient and it can never live in
isolation. How could this great wheat and
lumber empire dispose of its whole production on the domestie market? How could
this country, whose population of 12 million
owns capital and services sufficient to serve
30 or 40 million people, preserve her prosperity and her unusually high standard of
living without obtaining important foreign
markets? How could she ward off unemployment and over-production without ber export
trade?
Is not that commerce vital and essential to
Canada's economy?
For the intelligent promotion of our export
trade, our government must give its constant
attention to the various problems brought
about within the country by the rise in the
cost of living, the shortage of some building
materials, and labour, the instability of part
of the farming industrv and the countless
difficulties whichi crop up here and there, due
to ilie gradual and orderly abolition of price
controls, which was demanded by public
opinion. The government is considering, quite
justifiably, the continued application of some
controls which are indispensable and urgent
froin a national standpoint.
In discussing Canadian assistance to European eountries, allowance will have to be
made for the monetary difficulties which have
arisen, and the government officials have been
instructed to keep constant watch over production and supply conditions which tend
to raise the prices paid by consumers.

DECEMBER 9,1947

Among monetary difficulties which have
arisen, mention should be made of the crisis
due to the scarcity of United States dollars.
It can more properly be called a prosperity
crisis.
As a matter of fact, because of the great
prosperity which the country was en'.oying,
the Canadian people have lived in abundance,
they have had much more comfort, and they
have purchas.ed such a quantity of goods
from the United States at such high prices
that the balance wa.s upset between our exports and our im'ports. It was this adverse
trade balance which necessitated embargoes
and restrictions upon our trade with our
friendly neighbours to the south; but those
restrictions, urgent from a national standpoint,
are essentially temporary and we may hope
that they will be lifted before long.
In view of our export trade with the various
nations of the world, and owing to the recent
Geneva agreements, which parliament will be
cnlled upon to ratify, we must place our trust
in the govcrnment which bas applied emergency measures with tact, discretion and
efficîency, because ýCanada will no doubt be
able to preserve her national prospcrity provided ber export trade is maintained. There
is nevertheless a danger tbat our exports may
cause a greater scarcity of certain goods and
bring about unjustified risps in prices. But has
not the government taken every possible measure for maintaining our economnic stability?
Having observed some difficulties whicb our
Quebec farmers have undergone because of the
abnormal risc in the prices of wbeat produets
which bas occurred recently, I was pleased to
read in the -Speech fromn the Thronc that-the demand for the products of our primary
industries continues ta remain at high levels.
In view of the price fixed for the 1948-1949 crop
year under -the wheat agreement with the United
Kingdom, you will be asked ta consider a
measure to provide for an increase in the initial
payment ta producers.
It is indeed imperative that the wheat
situation be settled so tbat the prices to consumners sbould not be too hîgh.
May 1 mention, among other government
measures, such essential legislation as the
dominion labour code providing for the establisbment of more efficient macbinery for the
adjustment of differences between employers
and employees; the revision of tbe Canada
Sbipping Act, a measure of prime importance
in relation ta trade; plans for a low-rental
housing project for veterans, and many bills
relating to war veterans, who served their
country with such distinction and are justly

il

entitled to the government's consideration and
parliament's sympathy.
In conclusion, I may say that I unreservedly approve of Canada's foreign policy as
outlined by' the Minister of External Affairs,
the Right Honourable Louis St. Laurent, Who
recently stated in Mantreal that "in tbe
economic as well as in the political field,
Canada cannot be isolationist".
He said that our country could not be
isolationist in the political and economic
fields, that our duty and our higher interests
compelled us to co-operate with the United
States in the restoration of Europe, but that
such an objective could not be reached without close co-operation between Frencb-speaking
and English-speaking Canadians; that the
United States alone probably would not have
*been willmng ta help Europe; that in his
opinion, at this time, no country wants war
and, further, that no nation is now seeking ta
prepare an armed conflict; that he is convinced
that, throughout the world, war is abominated;
that if a third world war occurred tbere would
probably be no victors, as there were after the
wars against the Kaizer, Hýitier, and Japan's
imperialists; tbat democracies are naw able
ta produýce more than Soviet Russia and ber
satellites. and that they are more powerful,
from a military standpoint, than the U.S.S.R.;
that -the Russians will surely dominate Europe
if the United States Congress does flot
approve the Marshall plan, and tbat tbey are
now striving and will continue ta do aIl tbey
can ta prevent the ratification of that
measure, but that tbey will fail.
Hon. F. W. GERSHAW: Bonourable senators, in rising ta second this motion I must

SENATE

The people of Canada arc living relatively
bappily. They can bold their beads bigbi,
because they made a great contribution to
the rccent world wars. Those terrible wvars
had a shattering effeet on the economie systein. They cost mucb in mnaterial losses, but
most of ail in suffcring and deatb over the
wbole world.
Now a reconstruction period
has crne, and Canada is again rnaking bier
foul contribution. Lord Beaverbrook in bis
Sundoy Express, recently said:
In proportion to lier resources Canada bas
done more 'than any country in the world to try
to get Western Europe on its feet again.
Honourable senators, if tbere is one country
in tbis troubled world that wants peace, it is
Canada. If there is one country that is willing to give alI it can to the reconstruction of
tbi- war-damaged world, it is Canada. And
I niust say tbat there is one man wbo especially deserves great credit for so ably guiding
tbis country's activities and enabling it to
make tbe great contribution tbat it bas made.
That man is the Prime Minister of Canada.
the Rigbt Honourable W. L. Mackenzie King.
Some Hon. SENATOTIS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. GERSHAW: He bas held the
b'igbest position in the gift of the Canadian
people for a long, long time. He bas carried
on not only in days of qunshine but in days
of stress and storm, and bas kept Canada a
united country. He also bas been foremost
in tbe counicils of tbe Commonwealtb, and
bis prestige is bigb in the world at large. In
bringing bim into that small exclusive group
of eminent Britisbers wbo bave been decorated
witb the Order of Menit, His Majesty
bestowed an honour which is richly deserved
and bas been 'well earncd. I arn sure tbat ail
tbe people of Canada, including those wbo
are opposed to Mr. King politically, are pleased
witbi tbis recognition of bis long and devoted
services to Canada.
Soîne Hon. SENATORS: Hear, bear.
Hon. Mn. GERSHAW: Canada also bas an
able Minister of Agriculture, and be bas as
bais parliamentary assistant a young man who
may go a long way. At tbis time I appeal to
tbem to open up tbe American market, to
somne degree at least, for Canadian live cattle.
I tbink tbey sbould take wbatever measures
are necessary to make tbis market available for
our cattlemen. I quite realize tbat tbe embargo could nlot be lifted to allow shipments
of cattle to be rusbed to the border points ail
at once. Sucb a procedure would bave to be
carried out in an orderly way; quotas would

bave to be establisbed. Yet the step is a
most necessary one.
Early in tbe war tbe governinent put an
embargo on cattle going to the United States
s0 tbat there would be a supply of meat for
Great Britain. But tbe war bas now been
over for some ýconsiderable time, and if the
eattle industry is to survive and expand, s0
that tbe cattlemen may bave tbe modemn
equipment and bornes to wbich tbey are
entitled, tbis market is essential.
The ranchers; as a class are a bopeful and
o1)timistic peop)le; tbey are noted for their
neigbbourliness and bospîtality, and nobody
is ever turned hungry from their doors. But
life on a cattle farm is a bard life. At tbe
present time tbere is a pronounccd migration
frein tbe farms to tbe small towns and cities,
whieb is evidenred by the sbortage of boîîsing.
The work of a rider begins at dawn and does
not end until long after dark; in snow-storms.
in, sîcet and in main, as in tbe blistering beat
of summer, lie must ride the ranges, mend the
fences, wateh the water-boles and ]ook after
sick and (Iisabled cattle.
The rancber is
exposed to tbe elements for long bours witbout food and slhelter; lie must break wild
broncos and brand wild cattle.
For tbe
rancber, life is strenuous and dangerous; for
bis wife and family it is often filled witb
anxiety, bard work and loneliness.
Tbe cattle-farmer often suffers tragic losses
wben wbole berds are destroyed by disease,
and considerable expense is frequently incurmed
by lack of watcr, failune of grass crops or
nuinous markets. I know one rancee who
was driving a small trainload of prime steers,
ready for the market, to tbe stockyards, wbien
tbey were met by a blinding blizzard. Tbe
cattle scattered in ail directions, winter came
on and be ]ost an appreciable numben of tbem.
Sucb an incident shows tbat cattle raising
is a risky and strenuous business.
Canada undertook to supply 160 million
pounds of beef eacb year to Great Britain, to
be sold as dressed beef at from 22 to 25 cents
a pound. Tbat would mean tbat the price of
live beef on tbe boof would be 12 or 13 cents
per pound. At the samne time beef on tbe
hoof is selling across the border at fnoma 20
to 28 cents per pound. Tbat nepresents a
marked difference in price.
Tbe bigber price across tbe border is not
tbe only consideration wbieb causes people in
tbe cattle business to be very anxious and
determined to get tbe market open. Tbey feel
tbat tbe United States, with its rapidly grow-

DECEMBER 9, 1947
ing population, wili provide the best market
for Canadian cattie. The rancher must, look
a long way down the trail; he must plan
ahead, because the calves of today produce
the 'beef of three years hence. Meetings are
being ýheld in many places, the whole situation is discussed intclligentiy, and the
resolutions presented are all to the effcct that,
for the long-distance weifare of their product,
the ranchers must have the American market.
If anc asks a man an the street if he thinks
the embargo piaced by aur governunent
against cattie going to the United States
should be renewed, 'he wiii say, "Oh, na". He
does flot want ta sec a soarcity of beef in
Canada and he does nat wish the price ta
the consumer ta soar ta inflated heights. But
in my opinion that resuit would nat necessarily
follow. There must be sorne contrai over the
volume adrnitted ta the market in the United
States.
Judging by the tane of the resalutions, I
arn convinced that the cattiemen would be
satisfied if the meat 'board would buy a certain
quota af live cattle at Canadian prices, ship
thcm ta the United States and seli them at
the American prices, and eithcr use the profit
for the wcifarc of the indtlstry or, better still,
divide it amongst the producers in proportian
ta their sales during the year. That arrangement wouid aliaw the producer of beef to
get an increased price for his product-a
spread of probabiy 820 ta 825 on the average
-and would nat create a scarcity for aur own
dornestie requirements, and certainly should
not influence the domestie price.
One other o~bjection that is sornetimes
heard is this: How would we fulfil aur cammitments ta Great Britain if the United States
markets were opened? There is same doubt
as ta what may happen to the British contract, but let us assume that it wiii be carried
out. The answcr ta this objection is provided in the statistics found in the Canada
Ycar Book, which arc ta this eff eet: In 1929
Canada's cattie population was 8,375,000, and
in 1945, oniy five years later, it had increased
Even tlhough the
head.
ta 10,758,000
slaughter was airnost double what it had been
in previaus years, the cattle population in this
five-ycar periad increased by two and a haif
million. The increase was brought about by
better prices; and when prices are good, the
cattie are better fed, and more are produced.
Canada can produce enough cattle ta suppiy
the home market, having regard ta the -estimated immigration, higher standard 'of living
and greater domestic demand, and at the same

13

time have four or five hundred thousand
cattie for export each year.
In closing, honourable senatars, may I enumerate the advan.tages which would flow frorn
the opening up of the Arnerican market for
Canadian cattie. First, the cattiemen, who are
well inforrned, desire to get a quota in the
Arnerican mnarket. Since the Chicago yards are
oniy four -orfive hundred miles fram the centre
of the rangmng district, it is much casier to
ship stock that short distance than it is ta
send it 3,000 miles over land and sea to the
At a large ranch in
British market.
southe!rn Alberta, the Mclnýtyre ranch, a carefui record of sales has been kept. They
shipped before the war several carloads of
prime beef ta Britain, and when ail the large
sheets were made up it was found that the
price received was ruinceis. Their manager
says: "In normal tirnes the British market has
neyer been of mueh use to us, and it is not
likely ever to be of use." In this chamber is
a man who was one of the very first in Canada
ta ship cattle to Britain-I refer to the honourable senator from Marquette (Hon. Mr.
Mullins). He has been shippîng cattie since
1878. 1 asked him this afternoon if he had
ever made rnoney by shipping cattie ta Brita-in.
His answer was: "No; because of the rough
passage over the North Atlantic and the
damage done to the cattle, heavy losses are
sustained; and I can truthfuily state that the
logical market for our Canadian cattle is to the
south of us." Britain wiil buy cattle, where she
can buy themn the cheapest. We here cannot
compete with the cattiemen of Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay, Australia and New Zealand,
hecause their ranches are close ta ocean ports,
and because their cattle are out on the green
grass nearly all the year round.
The second point is that the people of the
[United States want our cattie. Mexican cattle
are shut out by the quarantine. We in Canada
are short of feed, and orders have corne from
as far as California for feeders and stockers ta
be fattened in the corn beit or from. the
product of beet sugar factories. The abattoirs
in the United States want our prime beef.
According ta recent conventions, they are
wiiling ta accept at a very low rate of duty
not 225,000 cattie but 400,000 cattle, and
200,000 caives instead of 100,000. The people
of the United States consume a great deal of
beef, and as the mast we could ever ship would
he less than 3 per cent of their total consumption, their farm bloc is flot likely ta object
very much to that smail quantity.

SENATE

My third reason is that there is evident
congestion in the processing plants in this
country. At the present moment in Winnipeg
there is a lot of beef which cannot be used
right away, and for which no cold storage
facilities are available.
The fourth reason has to do with finance.
We all know about the dwindling supply of
American dollars. Even if no more was donc
than to fill the quota which can go to the
United States at the low rate of duty of a
cent and a half per pound, the transaction
would bring from 80 million to 100 million
United States dollars into Canada,-enough to
relieve to a considerable extent our stringent
financial situation.
Again, at the moment cattlemen feel a great
grievance because their costs have increased
while the selling price remains the same.
Recently there was an investigation into costs,
and it was found that in the last year the price
of feed had gone up 57 per cent, that hay and
roughage had increased in price 25 per cent,
and that labour had gone up 25 per cent. This
means an average increase of 31 per cent; and
what is being asked is, either that the agreement with Britain be re-negotiated, or that
some other outlet be found.
The sixth and last reason why I think the
market should be opened is that the farmers
and beef producers of Western Canada are in
deadly earnest. They feel that they are carrying more than their share of the common
burden, and they are threatening a nondelivery strike. Such a strike occurred a year
or so ago; and as it was supported by a very
large number of people in the rural districts,
deliveries of meat could be held up very
effectively.
So it seems to me that in justice, and, if you
will, for the sake of peace and harmony, an
effort should be made to get, under proper
controls, a quota for our cattle in the United
States. The tending of flocks and herds is the

oldest and one of the principal occupations of
mankind; down through the ages it has brought
in great wealth; and in the interests of the
long-range welfare of the cattlemen of Canada
I urge that the action I have proposed be
taken.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Haig the debate
was adjourned.
BUSINESS OF THE SENATE
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Honourable senators, I should like to indicate, with your concurrence, what the programme for the next
two weeks will be. At the moment we have
before us the Speech from the Throne, the
resolution with respect to the Geneva trade
agreements, and a motion relating to the
extension of the emergency powers from the
end of this year to the end of March. In
addition, if the legislation arising out of the
dollar crisis shall have passed the House of
Commons, it will be presented to us in due
course. Because of the amount of important
legislation which is to come before us, I
believe it will be your desire to facilitate in
every way possible the discussion of this legislation. I accordingly suggest that we sit
this week up te and including Friday, and
that we adjourn on Friday until next Monday
evening at 8 o'clock, and sit during the rest
of next week te deal with the business as it
comes before us. I understand that it is the
wish of those concerned with the adjournment
for the Christmas and New Year's holidays
that the respective Houses of Parliament shall
adjourn a week from Friday: as to when we
shall reassemble after the holidays, I have
as yet no specific information, but as soon as
it is obtained I will communicate it to honourable senators so that they will be able
to make their plans accordingly.
The Senate adjourned until tomorrow at
3 p.m.

THE LATE SENATOR BENCH
On the Orders of the Day:
Hou. Mr. ROBERTSON: ilonourable senators, yesterday I stated that because of the
volume of business before parliament 1 would
ask the Senate to sit up to and including
Friday of this week and to return on Monday
evening of next week. I arn advised that the
funeral of the late Senator Bench will take
place at 10 o'clock on Friday morning. After
consultation with my colleagues I feel Cihat I
would be truly reffecting the wish of ail honourable senators if I were to suggest that
instead of sitting on Friday we should ad.journ
on Thursday night tilI Monday evenîng.
SPEECH FROM THE THRONE
AI)DP.E-;S

IN

REPLY

The Senate resumed frorn yesterday, the
consideration of His Excellency the Governor
General's Speech at the opening of the session,
and the motion of Hon. Mr. Fcrland for an
address in reply thereto.
Hon. JOHN T. HAIG: Honourable senators, as usual. the opening of parliament affords
the governmeut an opportunity, and the
opposition a greater opportunity, to explain
their positions and express their regrets for
some of the things that have happened during
the recess; and in the recent short recess many
more things have happened than usualiy take
place in a long one.
I wish to congratulate the mover (Hon. Mr.
Ferland) and the seconder (Hon. Mr. Gershaw) of the Address in reply to the Speech
from the Throne. I arn sorry that I could
not follow the remarks of the mover, but I

DECEMBER 10, 1947
certainly foilowed those of the seconder. In
view of the speech he mnade, I would say that
he is quite properly seated on thîs side of the
bouse; and when lie advocates that the markets of the United States be opened to Canadian cattle, I certainly welcome him into our
fold.
1 take this opportunity to join with both
the mover and seconder of the Addrese in congratulating the people of the British Commonwealth of Nations, and especially our own
Canadian people, on the wonderful wedding
ceremony which took place in London on
November 20, at which Canada was represented by the Honourable the Prime Minister.
We expect that with the effluxion of time
Princess Elizabeth and Prince Phillip will
become the rulers of flot only Great Britain
but Canada. While listening to, the broadcast
of the wedding ceremony one could flot
escape the feeling that home is still the best
place of aIl; for here was Princess Elizabeth,
a young wornan who lias the destiny of the
world on ber sboulders more lieavily than
anyone else, being wed in a simple ceremony
to the young man she loved.
Wbile we may differ in our points of view,'
I wisli toi congratulate the Prime Minister of
Canada on the lionour conferred upon hima in
reeeiving tbe Order of Menit. I think the
bonour was well deserved. I also congratulate
the people of Canada upon the fact that tbeir
Prime Minister, the Right Honourable W. L.
Mackenzie King, was recognized in this way.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: It la impossible for me
to deal with more than a few of the issues of
the day.
We of the generation represented in this
chamber can go back in our minds quite
liandily to, say, forty years ago. We were
then in the aftermiatli of the Victorian era,
and until 1914 we thouglit the world as we
knew it, would, like Tennyson's brook, go on
for ever. But in 1914 camne the first world
war, after which, until 1939, we experienced
what was no more than a truce, for there followed, from 1939 to 1945, the greatest war
the world bas ever known. Sînce then we
have had what may lie called a tentative
peace, and now we appear to have entered
the same old cycle. It is a very difficult
period; indeed, it could not lie more difficult.
It is not my intention to deal with world
affairs except very briefly and incidentally;
but as my views on this subject ere clear and
definite, perbaps 1 should state tliem now. I
do not believe that the ideology of democracy can co-exist with the ideology of autocracy. A year or two ago we commonly
5853--3j

17

lieard the view expressed tliat unless better
conditions were established in Canada, the
United States and Great Britain, or among the
democracies generally, we would go down
before the Russians. I arn frank to say 1 thenshared that opinion; but I no longer believe it
to be true. Nevertheless, though it is a bard
thing to say, I believe the two systeras cannot
live in the world together. 1 noticed that when
the Prime Minister landed recently in New
York lie was, to say tlie least, pessimistie.
Those who attended the meetings of tbe United
Nations last year and watclied the. conllict lietween exponents of the two systems were prepared for what lias liappened since. Talk about
progresa! We liave made no progreEs at ail.
There are fewer signs of peace than tbere were
two years ago; and while I do not believe in
war, or think it is inevitable, the probability of
it cannot be ruled out unless we of the democracies, knowing that democracy is a better
system than dictatorship ,are prepared to make
a strong stand for our principles. However, as
1 have soaid, this is a subject into wbieh I am
not going in detail at this time.
As regards Newfoundland and Confederation, I do not anticipate that Newfoundland
will consent to bie another province of Canada.
1 think our government went as far as it
could in the offer it made, and I liave not tlie
sliglitest word of criticisma to offer in that connection. However, buman nature being what
it is, I would just record my opinion tbat the
offer will flot lie accepted.
I notice from. reading tlie Speech from the
Tlirone, that my old friend rent control la
back again. We are told tliat we shal lie
asked to consider plans for a low-rental housing prol oct for veterans. As I have dealt witli
this subject at every recent session, 1 shaîl not
again refer to it at any lengtli. In 1941 the
government of this country put into force
rental controls and tbereby, whether tbey
intended to or not, told the people of Canada
that building coets would go up and would
double within six years. I challenge anybody
to deny it. A bouse which in 1941 could have
been built for a given amount, coste double
tliat sumn today. That statement is true of
my city and of every place else wliere I bave
inquired; and it alI started fromn rent control,
as a consequence of whicli new building was
virtually prohibited. You may say tliat that
is not true; but it is true, and for proof you
need only talk to any contractor wbo formerly
built three or four or six houses a year. What
liappéned was tliat lie quit building; and now
the goverfiment is confronted with a tremendous problem-tlie problema of how to get
liousing for the people wlio want to live in

SENATE

cities. I say that that situation is the direct
resuit of legisiation which has been passed in
the last four or five years.
To digress a little: no goverfiment has controlled the products of the farmer as rigidly
as this government bas done, and no government ever treated the farmers worse than they
have been treatcd by this government in the
last seven ycars.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Nol
Hon. Mr. HAIG: You say "no", but before
I arn through I shall prove thaýt I arn righit.
Consider wh*at bas hnppencd. The yeung men
and women who went from the farm, to the
factory and got big pay, decided that it was
flot worth while to go home to work, flot fortyeight, but eigbty-eight hours a week. These
people will flot return to farmn labour, and
today it is harder to get farm workers than
any other kind of labour. In Saskafchewan,
in Manitoba and in Alberta young men ýand
women by the hundrcds are leaving the farms,
and the population of the rural areas continues to go down. While the population of
Manitoba was reduced betwecn 1941 and 1945
by only 17,000, nearly 40,000 people left the
rural districts and went to the cities. Saskatchewan as a whole bais a smnaller population.
Jo Alberta the decline in the rural population
was more or less balanced by an increase in
the cities. What bas been the resuit? As I
puinted out wheu reîit coutrol was established,
numbers of people came f0 the cities and
wanted bouses, but n-obody would build, and
conditions have been terribly difficult for ýtbem.
I warncd the government that if the statement
made by Mr. Duncan, President of the Massey
Harris Company, is correct, in two years' time
we shail bave to face severe competition in
tvorld trade; we shaîl have te selI our goods to
the outside world at a competitive price. At
that time tbe displacement of population rnay
inean fresb troubles in connection willi bousing.
Already in my city we sec for sale many bouises
wivbih nohcdvý bias the money to buy. 1 recently
ùxamined a four-roomed bouse whjch was
offered at $6,950. There was ne culfivated lawn,
no garage, an.d no proper boulevard or street.
Before the last war such a bouse would have
been built for haîf tbe money. Today, in order
te buy if, one bas to put up a minimum of
$1.000, or at any rate $500. One may sc fifty
or a hundred bouses of this type, ail alike and
ail in a string: in a few ycars tbey will be
tenements. So much for rent control.
As the leader of the gevernment bas given
notice fbat be will move for consideration of
tbe Geneva agreements, and bas stated that
we can discuss them fully when they corne
before us. I do not intcnd to take long on

this subi ect. 0f every cigbt persons producing
in this country tbree are producing for export.
So we are intenscly interesfed in world trade,
even more so than tbe people of the United
States, wbo ship abroad only 3 per cent of
tleir production, whieb admittedly is very
large. It may be that tbe Geneva agreements
will help us to face this situation. I arn net
f00 optimaistic.
In reading tbem tbrough I
observe so many ifs and ands and buts that it
makes me uneasy. But perbaps it would be
wcll to say no more on tbis subi ect until we
have had an investigation and have heard from
practical men how these agreements may be
expected fo work eut.
Why have we been called together? It is
because a year 'ago, our boldings of United
States currency or gold amnounted te, in round
figures, 1 'billion 250 million dollars. Today
there is less than 400 million dollars. Further,
there remains less than 400 million dollars of
tbe loan te ýtbe Britisb government, and their
credit in, Canada is gene.
I have net heard anyone explain. why tbe
experts advised tbe government te change the
rate of oxchange in July, 1946. It bas heen
said -tbat ýour dollar in Canada will buy as
manch food, clothing andi sbelter as an Amenican dollar will. buy in the United States.
Therefore, it would seem. tbat our dollar
should 'be as valuabie as tbe American dollar.
To this 1 say perbaps. The difficulty is thar
tbe economic factor is net tbe only one that
enters int-o these transactions. Tbe fellow who
b-as the American dollar tbinks it is worth a
lot more money than bbc Canadian dollar.
In New York today it takes $1.12 in Canadian
funds te pay for eacb Amnerican dollar. That
may be requiresi. That is about tbc rate of
excbange. The fact is that Americans; in
order to rcalize tbe ten per cent profit that
tbey tlîought e-aisted, used to send Unitrd
States money intýo this country, not only by
wav of tourist trade but by way of investruent-I ain not talking about trade-but the
minute flhc moncy was put brick ro par
Amnerican funds were cut off as if by a knife.
Human nature bcbng wbat it is, the Amenicao tourist fbiougbt: "If I go te Canada with
$1,000 I sball have $1,100 to spend"ý-and he
came biere te try it eult. On 'tbe atber bansi,
the Canadien tbougbt: "If I go te tbe United
States I shaîl bave ýto pay 51.10 for eacb
Amnerican dollar I spend there. Damn it! My
dollar is as good as tbeirs, and 1 wen'.t do ii'.
During the past six men-ths hundrcds of Canadians from my borne city bave gene over
f0 sucb places as Minneapolis and St. Paul,
and bave spent from $200 te $500 that they
did net need te spend. They could have

DECEMBER 10, 1947
bought more goods in Canada with the same
amounit of rnoney. They just wan:ted to go to
the United States.
The minute rnoney went to par, Americans
who had investments in Canada began to sel
out. I know of one incident that occurred in
the vicinity of -the home -of my honourable
friend frorn St. Jean Baptiste (Hon. A. L.
Beaubien). An Arnerican owned a number of
farms there, and hie would not seli out as long
as the rate of exchange gave hirm $1.11 for
bis dollar. Later hie sold the land and took
bis money back to the Unitied States. Another
point is that we were getting a $3.50 bonus on
our gold and our pulpwood, and a ten per
cent bonus on ail other goods we sold to the
United States.
If you take the records from 1935 to 1945,
except for the three years wben the United
States bougbt war materials in Canada and
sbipped themn to Europe, you will see that
exchange bas always been beavily against us.
Wbat bappened was absolutely inevitable.
The reserve was running out. I knew it lust
spring. I asked one of the experts in committee how much we bad ini the way of a
reserve, and he would flot tell me. He dared
nlot tell me. It was running out fer faster
than bie bad propyhesied the year before. Why
did the government wait until November to
put on these restrictions? It was because we
were negotiating the Geneva trade agreements,
and we were persuaded by someone,' I think
tbe United States, that the agreernents would
fall througb if we ever interfered with the
excbange. How fast the reserve was going was
sbown wben Mr. King introduced the. agreements in a radio speecb one night at nine
o'clock and at ten o'clock the came night
Mr. Abbott followed with a speech which
wiped tbern aIl out. I did not even have to
move out of rny seat, because Mr. Abbott followed Mr. King immediately. We had thé
agreements and I wes rejoicing that we were
going to seli goods to the United States and
otber countries of tbe world, and were going
to be the most prosperous people on earth.
I thougbt of calling upstaîrs to my wife:
"Come on down. I arn going to, buy you two
new dresses. Tbîngs are going to be so good
we won't know wbat to do with all our
money." Fortunately, however, my Scotch
caution prevaîled, and I thought to myseif:
"Wait a minute. Mr. Abbott is yet to be
heard from." After listening to Mr. Abbott's
speech I thougbt: "Gee wbiz! Instead of
buying my wife two new dresses, she wil
bave to buy me a new suit".
Some Hon. SENATORS:

Oh, oh.

19

Hon. Mr. HAIG: The point is that the
Americans do not think our currency is as
valuable as theirs. It is my personal opinion
that world excbange should be put on a free
basis. Ultimately we -have got to corne to
that.
We have heard a lot of preachîng in this
country about tbe prosperity we were enjoying. If Mr. Duncan is rigbt, and I tbink hie
is, we bave only two years to get into world
trade and meet the competition of Europe,
Asia, and the United States. Cen we do that
on a forty-hour week? I do not think so.
We have got to face the situation, and the
sooner we do so the better it will be for the
people and the fewer tbe hs.rdehips they will
suifer. If tbe people were told candidlyand they sbould be-j ust bow fast our money
is running out, steps could be taken to adjust
our economy to meet the situation.
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: Does the honourable senator not remember being given ample
warning of tbat very fect a year ago lest
summer? At a special meeting of the Cornmittee on Banking and Commerce Mr. Towers
presentcd certain figures regarding Arnerican
dollars and predicted that within a year $600
millions of that arnount would be used up.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I wes present at that committee meeting, but Mr. Towers did not tell
me that a year later funds would be running
out like greesed lightning. He did flot tell
the government that; or if hie did, they did
not listen to him.
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: H1e considered he
had told them the year previous.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I arn neither defending for
prosecuting Mr. Towers. The Government of
Canada is responsible to the people of this
country, and if things had gone well I arn
sure that my honourable friend would not
have mentioned Mr. Towers. The government has to take the responsibility for
whatever bas happened. I rernember the
interview in the committee, and if my honourable friend is right and the government knew
the situation at that tirne, provision should
bave been made to meet it. Tbere should not
be a blanket prohibition of ahl products coming
into this country. Last Friday night the
representative of Great Britain in the three
western provinces told me the proposal, was
that any country would be allowed to ship into
Canada 200 per cent of what it shipped here
in 1937, 1938 and 1939. What does that mean?
At the present tirne the United States is
shipping to us practically aIl the cotton goods
that we import. They built up thet trade during
the wer, because it was better for us to get our

SENATE
cotton goods from the United States than
continue to order thcm from Great Britain
and take a chance on losses by submarine
action. Well, if this proposai goes into effect
the United States will be allowed to ship here
about 32 per cent of our cotton gonds. On the
other hand, Great Britain would like to send
automobiles into Canada. She bas been employing engineers from Canada to help ber
huild up an export trade, but she would be
allowed to seil only a comparatively small
number of cars hcre because ber business in

that line in the years 1937 to 1939 was smali.
These are some of the complications that arise
under this new scheme.
We had none of this trouble whcn there was
a prcmium of 10 per cent on American currency in this country. What happencd this
ycar? Why did tourists not bring in ail the
Ainurîcan snuney that had been expected?
Wbat moncy did they spend when they came
here?
Hon. Mr. HOWARD: Canadian moncy.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Yes, they spent Canadian
money w'hich they had bought at a discount
in the United States.
The goveroment
required everybody to turn over ail the
American currency they received to the banks.
The managing director of one of the largest
department stores in Canada told me that
when it was noticed that his company was
nlot depositing any Amnerican funds the govcrnment investigated, and found the explanatien to be that tourists were spending Canadian moncy. Wbere did they get it? Tbey
bought it from United States banks at a
discount.
Let me comne to some of the problcms of
the farmers. We lack American dollars at a
time when farmers in Manitoba, Saskatchewan,
Alberta, Quebec, Ontario and the Maritime
provinces would like to ship cattle to the
United States. We cannot sbip any over there
now, though as soon as the Geneva agreements
are put into effeet we shall be able to ship
somne. But why is the American market not
opened up freely to our producers?
Last
Friday a good 1,200-pound steer was wortb.
I think-and if I am wrong my honourable
friends who are in the livestock business cau
correct me-26 to 27 cents a pound in Minceapolis; but on the Winnipeg market, just across
the line, the price wvas 13 to, 14 cents. As my
bonourable friend from Medicine Hat (Hon.
Mr. Gershaw) said yestcrday, we sbould open
the market. Now, why not open the market?
Who, but the Government of Canada is
keeping the market closed?
T1here is a similar situation as to hogs and
grain. Barlcy is worth about $120 a bushel

in Canada as against about $2 in the United
States; and oats, which hring only 92 or 94
cents a bushel in this country, are selling at
about $1.50 across the border. Why not let
these produets be sold on the American market? It bas heen said that the minute this is
donc the cost of meat in Canada will go up.
On Monday, December 8, just a couple of
days ago, the Winnipeg Free Press, which is
not a supporter of the Progressive Conservative party, had an editorial entitled "Lift the
Embargo." I will nlot read it, but if anynne
so desires, I will place it on Hoosord. It
makes this point: we have got goods that the
Americans want, and if we want more United
States dollars we must scîl those goods to the
Americans. It goes on to say that if we do
this the price of those commodities will risc
in Canada.
Honourable senators, I can imagine that if
it was the Progressive Conservative party
which was in power and responsible for kecping our cattle off the American market, my
honourable friend froma Medicine Hat, (Hon.
Mr. Gershaw) would have said, "It is the oId
protcctionist policy that is keeping us from
trading with the world." Why did he nt
challenge the Minister of Agriculture to open
up the American market? The minister has
liad thrcp or four days in which to defend
thie present policy, but there bas been no
riefence of it.
Thýen of course it is said that if we make
the Ameri-can market available for our
producers of bacon and beef, we shaîl ot be
able to scîl these products to Great Britain
at present prices. But the farmers are the
boys Who are losing money on the deal. We
have been selling bacon and beef to Great
Britain at about two-thirds of what we could
get in the United States. Our farmers have
to pay the highest prices for the gonds they
buy, so why shourld thcy nt be allowed to selI
their products on the bighest market? I say
that if Canada wishcs to selI bacon to Great
Britain or any othýer country at 10 cents a
pouind wbien the Americans would pay 20
the people of Canada
cents a pound for
as a whoie sbould bear the loss. They should
pay the farmer 20 cents, instead of requiring
him to scil at 10 cents. We stick out our
chests and say: "Great Britain belped to save
the world for dcmocraey during the war, s0
we arc helping Great Britain now." But wbo
are 'the "wc" who take credit for hclping Great
Britain? I, a lawvycr in Winnipeg, and you,
a business man in Montreal, are taking ail
the credit, wbile we make the poor sucker of
a farmer pay the cost.

uit,

DECEMBER 10, 1947
In this morning's newspapers it was reported that the Parliarnen:tary Secretary to the
Minister of Agriculture said in Middlesex
yesterday that there would be some good news
for the farmers soon. Well, it had better be
very soon. Tbey are getting awfuflly tired and
hungry and mad because of this .thing. Let
me remind you of what happened to the cattie
industry. The government took tihe ceiling
off barley and oats on the 23rd of Ortober,
and prices immediately jumped about 30 cents
a bushel on -the average. That meant that
the livestock pr'oducer in Ontario, Quebec and
the Maritime provinces had to pay that much
more for 'bis feed, although the selling prices
for 'his own produiets remaîned at the old
levels.
Larn going to say somet-hing msw about my
old favourite, the grain question. I was glad
to read of tihe statement that the leader of
the Progressive Conservative party made
about the marketing of grain-it took him
quite a vwhile to corne to the conclusion, I
admit. There were certainly two views on
the question: one was tihat grain should be
marketed through oompulsory wheat pools,
and the other was tihat it should be sold on
a free and open market. You may say that
the second view is held by those who want
trading 'to be done on the Grain Exchange,
but I arn not interested in that aspect. What
does concern me is that, in a country where
we boast about desnocracy and free enterprise,
we say to our greatest induÊtry, the grain
producing industry, "You have got to sell
yrour products through our pools".
I was pleased to hear the leader of the
party to which I beiong say lat Monday
night that he was in favour of aiiowing the
people of Canada to seli their grain to the
pools if they wished, with the governrnent
providing the machinery to help them to do
so, but that they would aiso have the right
to seil under the free enterprise system to
anybody who wants to buy.
Hon. Mr. CRERAR: But up to that time
hie had been supporting the restrictive poiicy.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I have just admitted that.
Hon. Mr. CRERAR: Wbat was my honourable friend's stand on the question previously?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I have always been
opposed to the restrictive policy, and I said
se in this house last year. I ask my honourable friend from Thunder Bay (Hon. Mr.
Paterson), if hie read rny speech, to confirm
the fact that I was against the policy. 1
understand the attitude of the peuple of
western Canada as weil as my honourable

21

friend frorn Churchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar).
I have represented part of Manitoba in the
political field longer than hie has. I say that
when the farmers in our part of the country
are not allowed to seli their grain wherever
they wish, they are being most unfairly deait
Mr. Bracken now supports that
with.
contention.
When the wheat agreements came up for
discussion last year 1 opposed them as strongly
as I could; and I oppose them today. I
believe that no matter what happens, the
principle underly-ing the agreements is wrong.
Hon. A. L. BEAUBIEN: The leader of
your party did flot oppose thern ini the other
house.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: He did flot support them
either.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: He fought for them
in the other hoeuse.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: He went to Portage la
Prairie in the fall of 1946, when Mr. Miller
was elected, and opposed the agreements.
The resuit of the election showed that the
people of Portage la Prairie did not favour the
governrnent policy.
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: May I ask my
friend if it -is true that the leader of the
Progressive Conservative party, Mr. Bracken,
did not appear in the constituency of Portage
la Prairie at the time of the by-election?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Ask the honourable mernber from St. Jean Baptiste (Hoa. Mr.
Beaubien) whether or not the leader was there.
He held eight public meetings in that constituency. I have my evidence right with
me, because my friend from St. Jean Baptiste
knows that the leader did appear.
Hon. A. L. BEAIJBIEN: I wish to correct
my friend from Ottawa (Hon. Mr. Lambert)
in bis belief that Mr. Bracken did flot appear
in the Portage la Prairie constituency. But as
far as opposing the wheat agreements was concerned, I neyer saw sucb soft pedalling in my
life.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: That makes no difference;
hie opposed the agreements. He appeared at
eight different places, and the only poli that
Mr. Miller did not carry was the home of the
C.C.F. candidate. The place where the Liberal
candidate resîded was -carried by Miller.
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: I give ail credit to
Miller.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: My friend should be sure
of his facts before hie interrupts.

SENATE

Under the British wheat agreernents we sold
last year 160 million bushels of wheat to
Great Britain at $1.55 a bushel. In that deal
the governiment admits it lost $123 million;
but I sugge--st that twice that amount of money
was lost.
The governiment works out the loss in an
ingenious way, by taking the average price
throughout. That is flot the proper basis.
The farmer who sees wheat going up gradually in August and September is reluctant
to seli bis grain; be wants to hold it and let
tbe price go bigber. I do flot believe that
large stocks were beld for that purpose, but
even accepting the loss at the govemment's
figure of $123 million. it represents a huge
suma to corne out of the provinces of Manitoba,
Saskatchewan and Alberta. For this year the
loss bas been estimated at 8335 million dollars.
Hon. A. L. BEAUBIEN:
is that?

Whose estirnate

Hon. Mr. H{AIG: Tbat is Mr. Strangc's
figure, and be býas been right every time so
far.
Do honourable senators know ivhat one wbo
desires to purchase whcat for Italy, Spain or
any country other tban Great Britain, would
be .asked to pay today at the Winnipeg wbeat
pool? It is truc thiere is flot much wbeat for
sale, but when 1 left Winnipeg on Saturday I
was quotcd 83.35 per bushiel f.o.b. Fort William. Yet we are selling to Great Britain at
$1.55. By the agreement the farmers of Canada arc losing $1.80 per bushel.
Hon. Mr. PATERSON: May I intcrrupt
my friend?
I wish lic would refer to trie
Whcat Board and flot to tbc pool. The wheat
pool is an e.ntirely different organization.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I stand corrected on that
point. I should say the Wheat Board.
I arn opposed to the compulsory board
created by the goveroiment, but I bave no
objection to a man selling bis wbeat to a pooî.
If a farmer wishes to selI bis grain to tbe
N. M. Paterson Elevator Company, wby should
be nlot be allowed to do so? Some honourable
memibers may not kýnow that my fricnd from
Thunder Bay is one of thc biggest operators
in western Canada.
I arn criticizing tbc British wheat agreements because they ereate a peculiar situation.
Hon. Mr. EULER: May 1 ask my bonourable friend if be is in favour of the Canadian
citizen selling bis product and making bis
money wberever he likes?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: My friend bas butter on
bis mmnd.
Some Hon. SENATORS:

Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. HAIG: But if he will go along
with me and criticize 'the goverument for
what they are doing witb cattle, bogs and
grain, I arn prepared to support him on the
question of oleomargarine. First I want him
to get up and criticize the goverrnment.

Hon. Mr. HAIG: We might, and 1 tbink it
would be a goodt thing for Canada if we did.
Hon. Mr. A.
bribe.

L. BEAUBIEN:

That is a

Hon. Mr. HAIG: Last year Canada produced about 400 million bushels of wheat, of
wbý,ich 160 million bu..hels went to Great
Britain. 0f the balance, 120 million to 150
million bushels wvere used in Canada for feed,
soed and flour. leaving approximately 120
million ýbushels to be sold on the world market. That residue was sold nt a wide margin
of profit over the price of 81.55 a bushel, and
the board is now dlividing the profits.
This ycar our crop will proýbably be from
300 million to 32à million bushels of contract
grain. Out of that quantity 160 million bushels
will go to Great Britain; 120 million bushiels
will go for our own use, leaving approxirnately
20 to 40 million bushels to be sold on the open
rnarket. On that basis our profits next, year
will be much lower than this year.
Before leaving the grain question I wish
to tell honoura;ble members that the people of
this country are cating 'bread made of foeur
frorn whcat sold by the fariner at $1.55 per
biîshel when the price on the grain exchange
wvas $3.35. Bcfore the goveroiment took the
subsidv off wheat the price to the miller was
771 cents. As soon, as the subsidy was taken
off the price rose to 81.55. If Canada uses 50
million bushels of wheat throughout the vear,
the farmers will ]osc at least 90 million dollars.
We are eating brcad frorn wheat which cost
the farmer twice as much as lie xvas paid for it
and no one is complnining but the poor
farmer.
I wiAi to refer to the subjcct of coarse
grains, and in that connection 1 may *be pardoned for us.in'g a personal illustration. A
farmer carne into rny office around the first of
October and said, "I owe a client of yours
sorne rnoney, and you bave been after me for
it." I replied. "I sure have becn after yo>u."
When hie said, "I will pay you the first of
November", I questionedi him as to why he
should wait until tiien to pay the money. His
reply was: "I bave oats and barley in my
granary, and I arn going to hold thern until the
first of November because I hear that ceilings
are coming off and the price will go up 30 to

DECEMBER 10, 1947
40 cents a bushel." Within the next ten days
four or five other farmers came in and said to
me, "We can get that money £or you, Haig,
but we shall have to seil ouýr oats and barley."
1 said, "Wait until the first of November."
Now they think either that 1 arn a genius or
that 1 arn in- the confidence of the government
and must have kncown that, ceilings were to
corne off. If anybody other than the minister
knew it, presumably this man did; at any
rate he sold 3,000 bushels of oats and barley
and received $900 more than he would, have
got otherwise; and, that happ.ened to be the
amount he owed my client.
Hon. Mr. CRERAR: You did know, then?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: No, but he knew; that is,
he was confident that it would happen.
Hon. Mr. COPP: He was just a gambler.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: If ail restrictions were
removed frorn the grain market, prices would
rise at keast 70 cents a bushel. That is the
situation, and that explains the crisis. It is
also a compelling reason why men and women
in this chamber should forget politics and
impress upon the government of this country
that controls should be taken off and that our
primary producers, whether of grain or any
other commodity, should be free to seil their
products on the world mnarkets at world prices.
If we are to guarantee the farmer $1.55 a
bushel for wheat, the manufacturers of Ontario,
of Quebec, of the Maritime Provinces and
Britishi Columbia will be the first to complain.
" Why," they will ask, "should we pay the
farmers of Manitoba, Saskatchewan and
Alberta $1.55 il the world price of wheat is
90 cents?" If you give a guarantee to one
interest you will have to concede it to every
other form of production. The truth is that
we are going the wrong way about it. Mr.
Gardiner gambled with 600 million bushels of
the producers' wheat, and lie lost the gamble.
In the sixteen months which ended last
November we lost in this way $335 million,
the value of a whole year's crop iu aur western
country. Why did the minister do this? Apparently lie was advised by the pool men of
Saskatchewan, in particular-perhaps also by
the Manitoba pool, aithougli I do not knowthat it would be his political salvation. These
men were deterrnined that the grain exchange
should be put out of business, and to accomplish this purpose they would sacrifice the whole
grain trade of Western -Canada. If an instrument intended for one purpose is used to
achieve another, disaster always results.
In Manitoba this year our crop, with the
exception of flax and rye. was poor. The same
condition prevailed in Saskatchewan and, to a
lesser extent, in Alberta. In face of these
5853-4

23

facts we find the Parliamentary Secretary going
to Middlesex and telling the farmers: 'lHold
your cattle, hold your hogs; hetter days are
coming." Why shotiid we in a free country
follow a policy of that kind? It might be
expected ini Britain, under a sort of C.C.F.
government, or in Russia under a dictatorship,
but it is out of place here. Had the people of
Canada voted in favour of govermnent control
of everything, although I would have opposed
it, I would have nothing further to say. If our
people had decided that the farmers should
receive only a certain price for grain or cattie
or hogs, although I would not have voted for
it, I would have acquiesced. But the people
of Canada did no such thing. And now we
are paying the price of the government's
policy.
Hon. A. L. BEAUBIEN: May I ask my
honourable friend if the organizations which
are supposed to be representative of the
farmers did not consent to this wheat agreement? Were they not in favour of it? Surely
we have to listen to the views of the representatives of organized farmers.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: One of the best farm
papers, which used to be called the Grain
Growers' Gitide,-I do not know the present
Darne of itHon. Mr. LAMBERT: The Country Guide.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: -recently took a censuis
on this matter, and it reported that 55 per
cent of the farmers of western Canada were
opposed to aIl this grain control.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: That rnay be so, but
the point is, what were their views at the
time it was made?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Unfortunately it was
represented to the farmers that if this deai
were made the price of grain for years to
corne would be stabilized, and the market
ovc rseas would be maintained when the war
was over. I amn not an Englishman, and I
do not ýpretend to know the sentiments of an
Englishman, but I neyer heard of one allowing
sympathy to stand in lis way wheu lie was
making a bargain about anything lie had to
buy. You eau bet that lie made the best
deal lie possibly could uncier the circumstances.
The fact that we are selling to the Britisher
for $1.55 wheat that is worth $3.35 will be
no help to us in four or five years when lie
cornes to negotiate another agreement and
offers, perhaps, $1.55. As this writer says,
when two goverunents are dickering with one
another, the government which is seeking to
buy grain says, in effeet: "Unless you accept
my price I shaîl buy from somebody else",

SENATE

and the seller finds himself in a difficuit position, because he is afraid that if he does flot
seli he will ]ose lais mnarket.

I were a member of the government 1 would
not vote to cancel that contract; once made,
I would carry it out.

Hon. A. L. BEAUBIEN: I do flot like to
interrupt my bonourable friend, but he knows.
and so do 1-

Hon. Mr. QUINN:
But you would not
have made it in the first place.

Hon. Mr. HAIG: Ask your question; do
flot make a speech.
Hon. A. L. BEAUBIEN: -that ail the
farmers' organizations were in favour of this
contract. It was supported by the pools and
Dy the Federation of Agriculture.
Wheoi,
under such conditions, a contract bas been
made for so many years with Great Britain,
wvould my friend be iii favour of breaking it
n ow?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: My honourable friend
bas asked two questions in one.
Let me
answer his first question flrst. The wheat
pools do flot represent ail the farmers of
Western Canada-not by a long shot. I doubt
whether the mai ority of far-mers bclong to
these organizations. The bonourable senator
fromn Chu~rchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar) mav be
better informed on that matter than I arn. The
organizers of the pools control these people,
and the members fail into line. Tbey were
carried axv:w with the idea that by titis means
they would establish for themselves a permanent market ; but I helieve that those who
looketi into the records of such transactions
were opposeti to the agreemnent. 0f course.
bad members of the grain exchange &Ypened
their mouths about it, they would have been
told "This is the grain exehange. Don't listen
to thiem." Yet wlhcn the Hon. Mr. Justice
Turgeon, of Saskatchewan, investigated the
excliange lie did not find tbemn guilty.
The other question of the honourable senator from St. Jean Baptiste (Hon. Mr.
Beaubien) was, whetber I would cancel the
agreemnent were I now in office. I spoke about
tFhat a year ago: it is a hard question to
answer; but I do not believe that when
Canada's namne is affixed to a contract we
slioultl cancel that contract. I have always
feit, that contracts made on behaîf of our
country should ýbe carried out.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: Would the bonourable
senator suggest that Britain mighit break ber
part of the bargain?
Hon. Mr. HAIG:
I do flot suggest that
she may. Ail I arn suggesting is that wben
the four-vear terni runs out Britain will buy
in the cheapest market she can find. That
we have sold lier for $1.55 wbeat worth S3.35
will not influence ber one iota. However, if

Hon. Mr'. HAIG: No. 1 admit that. Take
the Geneva agreements: they can be cancelled at the end of three years, aad if after
three years I did not think tbey were te, tbe
advantage of Canada, I would caucel tbem.
But it would not be a good tbing for Canada
if, wlien the goveroiment changed, our contracts wvere repudiated.
Hon. Mr. CALDER:
Wbat about subsidizing the farmner to make good bais loýss?
Hon. Mr. HAIG:
My honourable friend
assme wbat about subsidizing the fariner
for bis losses? It ought to be done. For
the $123 million whicb the government bas
lost, an estimate should be put tbrougb tLo
recompense farmers wlio bave shipped grain
to the government.
Tberc is one more point that I sbould like to
toucb uipon before concluding. On October 22
of tbis year the government removed the cciiing price from oats and barley. Altbougb criticism miglit bave been offered for ceiling prices
having beca placed on these grains, nobody
could bave criticized the goveroment bad they
removed tbe ceiling prices on August 1 instead
of on October 22. Tbe only excuse tbat I bave
beard offered for taking action on October 22
wvas that a meat packers' strike biad been in
progress and tbe government wanted it to be
cnded before dcaiing with the question. If that
is an excuse, i t is n very poor one.
Wbat bappencd was that a large aumber of
western Canadian farmers bad soid the saleable part of tbeir oats and barley-I would say
seventy-five to eigbty per cent-by that date.
I do not know wbo owns the grain, but I arn
inclincd to tbink tbat the speculators and merchants of tbis country bave the iargest part of
it. 1 s.ay that the government shoulti not bave
removed the coatrois wben tbey did unless
they were prepared to recompense every farmer
who soid bis oats and barley between August
1 and October 22. As a matter of fact, that
is wbat ouglit to be done righit now. By their
action tbe governmcnt showcd an absolute disregard for the rigbts of tbe farmers of tbis
country, not only tbose of tbe prairie provinces
but farmers ail over Canada. Evcry part of
our country suffered by that action. If the
goveroment intended takiag tbe ceiling off
this grain tbey sbhouid bave annouaced the
fact last Jxxne or .Ixly, and everyone would
bave been ready for it. But tbat is not what
was donc: the governiment waited until the

DECEMBER 10, 1947
most disastrous period possible, wben a large
part of the farmers' products had been sold,
with the resuit that oats and barley went up
about thirty cents a bushel in price, and have
remained at that level since.
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: May I ask the honourable senator a question, simply to bring out
a point? Would the honourable senator flot
care to clarify part of his statement by saying
that most of-the coarse grains that were purcbased were hedged in the ordinary processes
that are adopted in the buying of grain?
When grain is purchased, the buyer hedges the
purchase by selling an option against it.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Between August 1 and
October 22 there were no hedging facilities in
Canada.
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT. There were such
facilities for coarse grain.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: No. Yeu could not hedge.
You could in the United States, but it would
be a very unsatisfactory hedge because prices
were at their lowest level.
I feel that the people of Canada are facing
a period of readjustment. We cannot enjoy
the unrestrained prosperity that bas been ours
since 1911 while the rest of the world is on
a starvation basis. A short time ago in this
city the Minister of Transport, the Honourable Lionel Chevrier, in speaking to the
Junior Board of l'rade or some such organization, said that we would have to sell more
goods and buy less, and that so long as the
rest of the world remained in its present condition we would have to accept the situation
and do the very best we could to meet it. 1
agree with t-hat viewpoint. I know it is a
harsh prediction to make, but I predict that
we are going to have to face tough times
ah.ead, and I think the proper thing to do is
to warn aur people in time so that they may
be ready for wbatever bappens.
Hon. Mr. EULER: Does the honourable
senator mean that we should sel more goods,
or give them away? How can we sell more
goods to foreign countries, if they cannot pay
for them?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: We could sel1 aIl the
cattle we liked to the United States, and we
could selI other products to South America as
well as to the United States; then if we had
a surplus of United States exchange, we could
seîl to Europe and wait for paymnent.
Hon. Mr. EULER: Does the honourable
senator suggest that we should not seil to
countries other than the United States?
5853-4à

Hon. Mr. HAIG: That depends on wbat
they can do for us. Honourable senators, I
have spoken long enough, and I thank the
bouse for its kind attention.
Hon. WISHART McL. ROBERTSON:
Honourable senators, I do not intend to speak
at any great lengtb, but I feel that rather
than adjourn the debate until tomorrow, when
I hope to move concurrence in the resolution relative to the trade agreements, I should
offer a few observations now.
Realizing that the mover and the seconder
were experienced parliamentarians, I was not
surprised at the clarity and excellence of the
remarks with wbich they favoured us. Their
speeches were welI delivered, and while in
essence they recited the problems with which
this country is faced, they approached their
task with a broad outlook.
My honourable friend from Shawinigan
(Hon. Mr. Ferland) took the broad view that
tbe future of Canada as a great trading nation
is tied up with those parts of the world which
bold political views similar to our own. To
my mind the vision that the honourable senator displayed in bis address is very creditaible,,
not only to himself but to those whom he
represents. The bonourable senator from
Medicine Hat (Hon. Mr. Gershaw) spoke on
a very important problemn-one to which my
horourable friend the Leader of the Opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig) bas referred-concerning
the almost contradictory situation that our
neighbours to the south require our goods
while we require their markets for dollar and
other purposes. Linked with that problem is
-the severe strain that might possibly be placed
upon our economy and our standard of living.
There may be arguments both ways, but the
speeches of the honourable gentlemen who
moved and seconded the Address in Reply,
constitute in tbemselves a particular themne
to which I sh-ould like to refer in general.
The speech of my honourable friend Ihe
Leader of the Opposition proves that bis
health is as good as it ever was. Whatever
figures may indicate as to bis age, it is certain that both in appearance and enthusiasm
be gives evidence of boundless energy. 1 am
not sure, however, that the logic of what he
said was equal to the force with which be saîd
it. 1 listened to him attentively as the leader
of the Progressive Conservative party in this
bouse, enjoying as I always do bis contribution
to the discussion cf public affairs. I bope
be will forgîve me for saying that as I lis'tened my mmnd went back to recent political
bistory in our country and the enunciation in
solemn tones of great doctrines and principles
hy otber recognized leaders of that party, and
I was forced to the conclusion that the most

SENATE

important of tbe many things that Canada
bas to be tha.nkiul for, from an economie
point of view, is that both during the war
and the reconstruction period hier affairs were
flot in the hýands nf public mon who, howev er
well-intentioned, bad that absolute lack of
consistency in principle that is evidenced by
the present leaders of the Progressive Conservative party. I think, bonourable senators,
that there bas been more blowing bot and
cold on major questions by the Progressive
Conservatives reccntly than there ever wvas by
any otber political party in tbe bistory of
Canada.
Hon. Mr. MORAUD: Small stuif.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I do not know of
one major issue witb wbich this coun.try is
faeed 'that you cnuld get two leading me'mbers of the Progressive Conservative party
to agree on. They blow hot and oold on
controls. My bonourable friend urges that tbe
control be taken off rents, and some otber
memýbers of bis party urge that it be kept on.
There was scatbing erit.ioisma ni subsidies, and
tbere bas been scathing criticismn oi their
discontinuance. I do flot need to, remind
bonourable membeýrs of what bappened in
two recent by-elections in eastern Canada.
Despite the fact that the York-Sun'bury riding
in Ncw Brunswick bias been tradýitionally Conservative, and ýthat 'the Halifax seat bias in
the p.ast ýbeen won -as often by the Conservatives as by the Liberalýs, the Progressive
Conservative party's vacillating policy on
major questions facing this country today
was sucb that that party lost rboth eleetions;
and indeed in Halifax its candidate dropped
to third place.
Hon. Mr. QUINN: Tbat wns not the reason
why they lost.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: My honourable
iriend says that was not the reason. Well,
certaietly the party's presentation was not
regarded very highly by 'the constituents, or
else they would bhave voted differently. My
honourable iriend knows that.
Wbat is the situation in this country? The
honourable leader opposite (Hon. Mr. Haig)
paints a gloomy picture; but I suggest to hiim
and to ail otber bonourable members tihat the
position of Canada today, when everything
is taken into consideration, is a very satisiactory one. I suggest that, chiefiy oi course as a
resuilt of the gond sense and intelligence of
the people of Canada, but also because ni
the administrative programmes ni the goverfiment during the war and in this perind oi
return to normal conditions, Canada bias

acbieved a degree nf economin prosperity that
is perbaps not exceeded in any country in the
world. This economin prosperity, largely by
reason of administrative action, hias been distributed so, iairly and reasonably over tho
wbule mass ni tbe people, and the cost oi
living bas been an kept down during war years,
that the position nf the average Canadian
today is one that can only be appreciated
when looked at objectively. Despite the dismal picture so graphically painted by my
honourable friend ni the circumstances oi
farmers in bis province and in eastern Canada,
in ailseriousness I ask honourable senators to
bear in mind bow the income nf the major
primary industry oi this country lias improved.
Anynne acquainted with tbe mects knows that
tbe gross and net return of agriculture tbis
year will probably reanb a figure which, if not
a peak-, is at least twice as high as it was
before tbe war. And further, as my bonourable friend knows fuît
well, this high income
bias been utilized wisely in reducing outstanding obligations to an extent neyer beinre
attained in this country. Neyer before bias the
agricultural income been put to sucb gond
use as a hedge against the future.
Wbat is true ni agriculture is true also of
other brancbes of industry. My honourable
friends who are engaged in manufacturing
know~ that tbeir industries were neyer in a bappier position tban today. They bave paid off
tbeir obligations or reiunded them at lower
interest rates, and there are bulging treasuries;
in fact, some people tbink that financial conditions in tbis country are almost excessively
good. In tbe ligbt of the situation as we find
it, one woudd have to bc pretty pessimistic
and take a very narrow view nf conditions to
arrive at the conclusion which. my bonourable
friend expressed-indeed I bave grave doubts
that my honourable friend bimseli bias in iact
reacbed sucb a conclusion.
We are facnd witb problems arising to a
considerable degree out oi our grnat prosperity.
Our price level bias been kept down to sucb
a point tbat it is impossible for mnst otber
countries to selI in our market. It is for tbis
reason tbat, for instance, our traditional eustomer and supplier, Great Britain, finds it.
very difficuit today to sell in tbe Canadian
markt. At the saine time the pent-up purcliasing power oi tbis country, resulting irnm
wartime savings and unprecedented wages,
salarins and general returns irom business, bias
tried to find an outînt in tbe customary way;
and as we ourselves bave ot been producing
sufficient gonds to meet the demand, xve have
bcen buying lteavilv from the United States.
This bias brought about some scrinus conse-

DECEMBER 10, 1947
quences. During the discussion on the Foreign
Exchange Control Bill we were told that this
would likely happen, but the development has
been at a more accelerated pace than was
anticipated. 0f course, there is flot the
slightest doubt that extraordinary conditions
in Europe have had a great effeet here, but
we should flot lose sight of the fact that when
everything is eonsidered Canada is one of the
happiest countries in the world fromn a goverfimental and business point of view. It is in
a stronger position today than it bas ever
been before, and the very last thing that we
should do is to get panicky and conclude that
our present situation is anything but a passing
phase. The simple and logical solution is to
deal with it in its natural form and to correct
an immediate condition.
There have been heavy demands upon
Canada's reserve of foreigu exehange, particularly in relation to United States dollars.
My honourable friend opposite is to a certain
extent justified when he asks: "Why did the
government bring the dollar back to par at
the time it did?" Tbe answer is simple, and
it is this: The government brought the dollar
back to par because of the probability that,
under then existing conditions, it would result
in the maximum advantage to the people of
Canada. As my friend knows, it was expected
for one, reason or another that our imports
from the United States would be high, and
that the placing of the dollar at par would
add an extra 10 per cent to the cost of imports,
thereby relieving some of the pressure on our
price ceilings.
My friend opposite 'brushes aside with a
gesture of bis band the problein of rising
prices, and says "So wbat!"l I say that this
government regards the rising oost of living
as a serious matter. There are features of it
which are more or less inevitable; but we
have treated it seriously, and as a consequence
have often been subjected to criticism and
abuse hy our honourable friends opposite.
We fouigb't to gain control -over prices wiûh, I
believe, the support of the vast mai ority of
the Canadian people; and if the seheme was
not the success it might have been, that was
largely due to -the unending criticism, and
sniping that came from. the Progressive Conservative party in, this country.
We are
interested in prices and the, cost of living,
whetber my honourable friends opposite are
or not.
During the war years we were successful in
isolating ourselves in an economical way from
the United States. Our surplus farm products
were sent overseas, and our imports from the
'United States were smaIl. The impact of high

27

prices in the United States had no great effect
upon us then; but as we moved into a world
of multilsteral trading, and raised our price
levels, i't was our hope that when the obstacles
were removed Canada would be able to meet
competition in the wotld, markets with ilittle
dîislocation of 'ber eeonomy. It was entirely
unexpeoted that loss -of farm products in the
United Kingdom and on tbc Eutropcan continent would create sucb a great demand for
agricultural products from the United States
and Canada. As a result of an act of God
the demand. for agricultural products is bigher
on the Arerican market today than it otherwise would have been. This condition could
not have been foreseen.
I am prepared to admit that as we rnove
from the position of having our trade largely
channelled to Great Britain, with tbc maintenance of price levels by reason of oontracts
with that country, and enter into a condition
of mudtilateral trade which. we hope will
follow the restoration of the trade routes oi
the world, ut is inevitable that our price levels
wMl ascend. to meet world prices. Suéh a
change will cause some unavoidable dislocation, and wil'l require the best brains and
judgment in Canada to deal with it.
I say again to the honourable leader opposite that this country is essentially on a sound
economic basis. In my opinion it is in a
bappier position than any other country in
the world., 1 believe that the difficulties witb
which we are now concerncd are transitory in
their nature, and in the end may have a
beneficial effeet upon us.
The reports of huge agricultural production
in this country during the past two years,
together with full employment and great economic advances, have been at times almost
frigbteniog to me. I bave asked myself: How
is it possible that today, when such suffering
and such difficulty is being experienced by
the major countries of the world, we sbould
be so prosperous and happy? It may well be
that our present troubles and conceras will
have the effeet of chccking us, so that we may
avoid excesses which could seriously affect the
whole economie life of our country.
My frîend was no doubt drawing on bis
experiences at the United Nations meetings
wben he pictured the two strong ideologies
which exist in tbe world today, and whicb
cannot live together. The very tbought is
terrifying, for if the two factions cannot live
together it means that war between them is
inevitable. I have no way of knowing that
sucb a war is inevitable, but I believe that

SENATE

our system of econornies and our way of life
is on trial today as neyer before. On the one
side there are the United States and the other
countries which in varying degrees share our
%-iews; on the other side is Russia and those
countries whose views differ so widely frorn
ours; in between is the great mass of people
who have flot made up their rnjnds one way
or the other, and who are in doubt as to
what course to take. 1 arn convinced that
if Canada goes frorn excess to excess, witb a
continuai piling up of wage increases and augrnented costs of production, the crash will
corne with terrific force. If our economic
systern were to be tried and found wanting,
wbaf, substitute would there be for it? With
such a spectacle before thern, what would be
the thoughts of those countries of the world
which are sitting on the sidelines?
Honourable senators, I believe that Canada
flot only is greatly responsible for the welfare
of her own people, but is morally obliged to
join in providing other countries with a standard of living that will discourage the growth
of comrnunism within their bounds.
If we think through the problerns which face
us and deal with tbem in a spirit of fuill confidence and the resolution to build the best
possible national economy, we need have no
particular fear of a spread of communism.
People, no matter who they are, desire to be
free and to enjoy the highest obtainable
standard of living. If we so aet that our.
national economy can withstand the scrutiny
and survive the test of those who would find
fault with it; if we cao so order our affairs that
there shahl be no recurrence of the terrible
experiences which befeli us between 1931 and
1933, we shahl not need to worry much about

the impact of eomrnunism on thiýs country
or other countries which follow our way of
thinking. But if we fail to approach our problerns with these purposes in mi, and therefore
fail to solve them, there will be before us
times of great anxiety, because we shail be
menaced not only with bayonets but with the
activities of those wbo corne to our country
irnpelled by a different point of view.
During the discussion of agricultural matters,
particularly in the West, I have been surrounded by experts whose knowledge of the
complex subjects involved is so much greater
ihan rny owvn that, recognizing rny inability
Io answer successfully rny honourable friend
opposite, I shahl leave the matter to them. My
honourable friend is skilled in the law and in
matters pertaining to western agriculture. But
I urge him, whatever the ternporary problerns
with which he or bis constituency are faced,
to be of good faith, because it is to be remembered that despite their difficulties agriculturists neyer before have been as prosperous
as they are today; never were they in se,
sound a financial position to face the future.
I would add also that neyer have ýthey contributed more to the general wclfare of the
country. The conditions to which rny honourable friend referred in such forcible terrns are
not such as should worry hirn particularly,
because they ivili be deait with, as far as
any government can deal witb such conditions,
with the same care and success as bas characterized the administration in the past.

TARIFFS AND TRADE
UNITED NATIONS CONFERENCE AT GENEVA
APPROVAL OF GENERAL AGREEMENT

Hon.
moved:

WISHART

McL.

ROBERTSON

That it is expedient that the houses of parliament do approve the general agreement on tariffs
and trade, including the protocol of provisional
application thereof, annexed to the final act of
the second session of the Preparatory Committee
of the United Nations Conference on Trade and
Employment held at Geneva f rom Aprii 10 to
October 30, 1947, together with the complementary agreements of October 30, 1947, between
Canada and the United States of America and
between Canada and the United Kingdom; and
that this bouse do approve of the same, subjeet to the legisiation required lu order to give
effect to the provisions thereof.
Hie said: Honourabie senators, during the
time that I bave occupied the responsible
position of government leader in this bouse,
there have been many occasions wben I bave
had the great bonour and privilege of presenting legisiation for your consideration. But
however long I may be bonoured with such
opportunities, I de not beiieve that it wil
fail to my lot to present in this chamber pro-

posais which, because of their intrinsic importance and their implications, are greater than
those contamned ini this motion.
This motion relates to a matter in which
I have not oniy a general interest as a Canadian, but which appeals to me personaily in
greater degree than any other question of
publie poiicy. I do not know why I should
be particulariy interested, in a generai sense,
in freeing the channeis of world trade; but
from the first moment that I was able to
appreciate anything in the home in whicb
I was brought up, on the south shore of Nova
Scotia, I remember that, rightly or wrongiy,
we associated the position in which that part
of the country found itseif with what had
occurred in previous years to interfere with
the free fiow of international trade. I remember spending my boyhood holidays in Lockeport, near the wharf where years before mny
grandfather bad been engaged in the shipping
trade. There was a time when bis business
had progressed te such an extent that sometimes four or five seagoing brigs were moored
to one little wharf, and these vessais would
carry the commerce of the world back and
forth between. Nova Scotia and other countries. Two of my mother's sisters were married
to my grandfatber's ses, captains. That was
the atmosphere.
With the passing of time I aiways felt that
the various impediments that had deveioped
in the way of free international trade had
rung the deatb-kneii of ail that we had
thought so important, and I hoped that one
day some major turn of public opinion wouid
serve to re-pen the channels of free trade,
nlot only for the benefit of Nova Scotia but
for Canada in general and the worid as a
whole. I remember thriliing to a speech that
was made by my honourable friend from
Churcbill (Hon. Mr. Crerar) during one of
the election campaigns in Antigonish. I am
not sure that I recali bis words accurateiy, but
the purport was that the growing impediment
te the free flow of international trade bad
taken the breath of the sea, from the nostrils
of Nova Scotians. I recail bow I tbriiled to
that statement, and how compieteiy in accord
with it was my own viewpoint.
Honourable senators, the documents which
have been tabled in this bouse and to wbich
we shail give consideration, represent the
various agreements reacbed at Geneva. I
shaîl enumerate themn now because in due
course they will be considered in dietail.
Firat there is the general agreement on
tariffs and trade, pu-biisbed in four volumes
by the United Nations, and signed on October
30, 1947, by representatives of tbe following.

SENATE

twenty-three nations:
Australia, Belgium,
Brazil, Burma, Canada, Ceylon, Chile, China,
Cuba, Czechoslovakia, France, India, Lebanon,
Luxembourg, The Netherlands, New Zealand,
Norway, Pakistan, Southern Rhodesia, Syria,
South Africa, Britain and the United States of
America.
The general agreement on tariffs and trade
consists of three parts and an annex of twenty
tariff schedules, one for each country, including Benelux and the Syria-Lebanon customs
unions. As honourable senators know. Benelux is the composite name covering Belgium,
The Netherlands and Luxembourg, which
countries are to have a customs union of their
own with one signatory for all three.
Part I of the general agreement concerns
the principle of most-favoured nation treatment and the application of the new tariff
schedules; Part Il contains the general commercial provisions which appear in Chapter
IV of the draft charter now under consideration at Havana, and Part III concerns the
implementation of the general agreement.
Schedule V to the general agreement is
printed in the United Nations document, and
separately as No. 27A in the Canada Treaty
Series, 1947. It lists the new rate of duty
on all products on which Canada has granted
tariff concessions. The rates in Part I apply
to all countries to which Canada extends
most-favoured nation treatment; the rates in
Part II apply to all countries which qualify
for our preferential tariff.
Then there is the protocol of provisional
application of the general agreement on tariffs
and trade. This protocol, which appears on
page 88 of the document entitled No. 27 in
the Canada Treaty Series, 1947, Final Act of
the Second Session of the Preparatory Committee of the United Nations Conference on
Trade and Employment, has been signed by
eight of the twenty-three countries-Australia,
Belgium, Canada, France, Luxembourg, The
Netherlands, The United Kingdom and the
United States-but remains open until June
20, 1948 for signature by the other fifteen
signatories of the general agreement. For
various reasons involved in the necessity of
parliamentary sanction, or whatever other
method of approval is employed, these fifteen
countries have not yet signed the agreement,
and consequently their schedules will not
come into force on January 1, 1948, as will
ours and those of the other seven countries
which have signed the protocol.
The signatories of this protocol agree to
apply, provisionally, Parts I and III of the
general agreement-which relate to tariff concessions; and to apply Part II-which relates
to commercial practices-"to the fullest extent

not inconsistent with existing legislation."
Signatories may withdraw from the protocol
on sixty days' notice. In other words, if the
signatories of the respective administrations
cannot secure the necessary governmental
sanction upon giving sixty days' notice, they
can withdraw.
Supplementary agreements appear in appendices A and B of the document entitled No. 27
in the Canada Treaty Series, 1947, pages 91-107.
Appendix A consists of an agreement betwe'en
Canada and the United States of America,
supplementary to the general agreement of
October 30, 1947, on tariffs and trade, together
with an exchange of letters and a note from
the Canadian government to the United States
government concerning the amendment of
the customs tariff of 1907. Appendix B consists of an exchange of notes between Canada
and the United Kingdom relating to the
trade agreement between the two countries
of February 23, 1937, and to the general agreement on tariffs and trade of October 30, 1947.
Honourable senators will appreciate that these
have to do with the reconciliation of agreements made between Canada and the United
Kingdom and between Canada and the United
States, in regard to the various treaties already
in existence.
I hope the fullest possible details will be
made available to this house. It seems to me
to be desirable that this resolution and the
related documents should be considered in
conjunction with complementary moves that
have been taken or may be taken in the effort
to remove as completely as possible all barriers to international trade. Ever since the
Atlantic Charter the United Nations have
been hammering out agreements for co-operation in trade and currency matters, to the
end that as far as possible the mistakes made
after the last war should not be repeated.
These efforts have resulted in: (1) the International Monetary Fund-intended to prevent
competitive exchange depreciation, to stabilize exchange rates and to help nations in
balance-of-payment difficulties; (2) the International Bank for Reconstruction-the purpose
of which is to revive international lending on
a large scale for such productive purposes as
reconstruction and industrial agreement; and
(3) this general agreement on tariffs and trade
-a
concrete step toward reduced tariffs,
preferences, restrictions and discrimination.
And at the moment there is being considered
in Havana the I.T.O. draft charter, a blueprint of the free, non-discriminatory multilateral trading world toward which the nations
are committed to move. Should drafting of
that charter be attended with success, matters

DECEMBER 11, 1947
resulting from it will undoubtedly be pre.
sented to tahis bouse for consideration ini due
course.
Before I go into a littIe more detail I think
it would be well for us to refresh our memories
of what happened immediately before and
after the last war, in order that we may better
appreciate the efforts that are being made to
build on a firmer hase than was then established. Many honourable members know far
better than I do that prier to the last war
international trade in the main was on a reason.
ably satisfactory basis. Great Britain was the
chief trading country of the world; her markets were open to the produce of other
countries; she was the world's banker. We in
common with other countries found, in her a
ready market for our supplies, and enjoyed
a reasonably smooth flowing of trade backwards and forwards. It is truc that Canada
and some other small countries had erected
around themselves tariff barriers by means of
which they sougbt to encourage a degree of
development within their own respective territories; but, as compared with today and recent
years, there had been relatively few obstacles
in the way of the free flow of trade. The
United States had been more or less a nation
to itself. It was a very large country, with
tariff walls around it, and not a big factor in
international trade. I think that perhaps the
first move of major importance made by the
United States in recent years toward the
removal of tariff barriers was the reciprocity
proposai of 1911. As honourable senators will
recali, it did not materialize. Then, in 1913
the United States introduced the Underwood
tariff, granting concessions which, although
not as great as would have existed under the
proposed reciprocity agreement, nevertheless
were a material factor in opening markets for
our experts.
With the Underwood tariff in effect, 88-4
per cent of our experts entered the United
States duty-free, and our trade 'with that
country grew fromn $138 million in 1914 to
$S42 million in .1920. That period after the
First Great War was marked by dislocation
of European production and trade, and there
began to appear what had hitherto not been a
factor of any importance in international trade,
namnely, exchange restrictions and quotas; and
they were followed by wide fluctuations in
currency. In 1921 our currency dropped to 87
cents in relation to the American dollar. That
year the United States, for one reason and
another, including the effect of the depreciated
currencies of other countries, imposed what was
called the Emnergency tariff; and Great Britain
departed from her traditional policy of fret

trade by inlposing a tariff of 33J per cent to
protect ber key industries. In 1922 Congress
pqssed the Fordney-McCumber tariff, and our
experts of farm products to the United States,
which in 1920 had amounted to $191 million,
feil by 1929 to $92 million.
In the period- between 1922 and 1929, largely
as a result of the dislocations following upon
the First Great War, all countries were busy
erecting tariff walls. French tariffs went up
to seven or eight times their pre-war level.
Europe's huge debts could be paid off only
by the sale of goods or the receipt of further
boans. But the new tariffs and tbe fligbt of
capital prevented either solution, and the
result was a merry-go-round of default, currency depreciation, import quotas and exchange
restrictions. In 1929, as honourable senators
will remember, the depression began, and in
the next year the United States imposed the
Hawley-Sxnoot tariff. Under that tariff Canad-ian exports of farmn produets to the United
States felI from the 1929 total of $92 million
to $6 million in 1932. copper exports fell to
one-sixth of their 1929 value, and lumber to
one-flfth. In 1931 tahe Canadian dollar fel
to a new low of 84 cents. During that year
nineteen nations went off the gold standard,
sixteen devalued, their currenty, and twentyone introduced exchange control.
In the period from 19&2 to 1935 the empire
preference wall was erected. Thenl came a
collapse in the Ulnited States, accompanied
by bank failures and depreciation of currency.
Every nation tried to expert its unemploy..
ment problem by restricting imports, devaluing currency, controlling exchange, imposing
quotas and embargoes, and by usîng a host
of other devices which strangle trade.
The years 1935 te 1939 were characterized,
hlowever, by a new attempt to reopen trade.
The United States reciprocal trade agreements
program was the first step in a long process of
cutting tariff barriers. In 1935 and 1938 Canada signed frade agreements with that country, and our experts to il began to climb;
but very slowly. The actual figures were
$305 million in 1935 and $376 million in 1939.
The years 1939 to 1947 brought a new spirit
and a new set of economic controls and
restrictions. There were, for instance, the
Hyde Park agreement, iend-lease, mutual aid,
the Atlantic Charter, the Bretton Woods
agreements, boans to Britain, export cred-its,
and now we have the Geneva agreement. It
must be remnembered that the various
obstacles to trade during the war seemned to
have a greater effect on the 'United States,
than on ourselves. It is unbelievable that the
mistakes made after the Firet Great War
should be repeated. in an endeavour to have

SENATE
the counitries of Europe repay their debts
when at the same time their debtors refuse to
take tbeir goods in payment.
Honourable senators are aware that thýe
amounts of money advan-ced by the United
States during the recent world war exceýeded
by far its contributions during the First World
War. The thought of requiring the countries wbo received the benefits to repay in
the manner attempted following -the first wer,
and whicb biad sucli a vital effcct on oui
economy, has practically been given up.
In an attempt, to approach the present
-problem
on a sound basis there are tbree
deterring factors affecting the flow of international trade ýthat must 'be recognized. I do
flot, know tlîat I put the.m in their correct
order, but the first, 1 would say, is exchange
instability; the second is tariffs generally; and
I would place third the hidden 'tariffs whichi
cause the regular tariffs to lose their significance. In this latter category there are, for
instance, the valuation of currency for
exchange purposes, quotas and new methodý;
of carrying on trade, sucb as are now engaged
in by the Furopean countries and which may
continue. In this connection 1 should mention
state purclîasing and bulir buying.
It is quite obvious to honourable senators
that wbhat, tariffs there are in France or Great
Britain against our goods have very little significance, if at the samne time the method of
trading i.s for the governiments, of those contries to purchase the total requirements of the
country and, for one reason or anýother, to say
that they have no intention oif purchasing out
gooda,,.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: That is wbat the governments are saying 00W.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I give th'at as an
instance of the present problem. It is therefore important and desirable tbat lower tariffs
-if they are to be effective in attaining the
objective wbich evervone seems to have in
mmnd-be considered in ail their implications
in relation to other thingsz
The first coimidera-tion was the establishment of a relative stability of exchange. The
representatives of forty-four nations met at
Bretton Woods in the summer of 1944 to agree
on a code of conduet rogarding monetary
practices, and to set up ag-encies which woul
assist, in restoring stability of exchanýge and
international
investments.
The Bretton
Woods agreements were signed in June, 1944,
and Canada ratified them in December, 1945.
The International Monetary Fund is a
pool of gold and national currencies, to
wbieli each member subscribes a quota. A

nation faced with t cmporary balance-of-payment difficulties may draw on this fund for
nid in tiding over these temporary difficulties.
The fund is not design-ed, however, to deal
wîtb the vast, dislocations of the transitional
period; its aims are long-run aims. Our chief
obligation under the fund is flot to vary our
exchange rates, except to correct a "fundamental disequil.ibrium". If we change the exehange
rate by le-ss than 10 per cent we must
coniut the funil; to change it ýby more than
10 per cent we must get the permission of the
fun-d. We must also avoid a variety of restrictive currency devices as early as our post-war
problems will permit.
This brings us, honourable senators, to a
question th-at today is very much to the fore;
and like many ouber problems, it bas two
,,ides. During the period between the two
world wars, with the accompanying difficulties
of the deýpression days, the depreciaýtàon of
currency became a common practice. The
purpose of it was quite obvious. Countries
wbich liad goods that were priced bigh in
relation to potential markets could flot selI
tlîem and were forced, or tbey believed they
were forced, ito devalue their currency. That
procedure made it easy for tbemn to selI tiheir
goods in the market tbhey wis-hed to obtain.
We are discussing a parallel condition today;
we are considering a depreciation of our currency to make it easier for us to seli our goods
1n, let us say, the American market.
This
manoeuvre would simplify the matter of
export, because the American dollar would
then go much further in the purchase of our
goods. Therefore it would seemn to solve our
difficulties; but the whole record of commercial transactions goes to show that the solution is net so simple. True, ilt would be simple

way? If Canada were to depreciate ber corrency, ber ability to seIl in the United States
market would be increased should -the other
cotîntries with whom we are in competition
for that market stand blissfully by; but when
we followed that procedure in 1921, other
countiies became serions contenders with us
in the American market, and public opinion
in the United. States forced the goverriment, of
that country to take retaliatory measures.
The resuît was that we reverted to our former
position; it was almost as if the reverse position had heen adopted.
For instance, if

other counitries, we allowed thema to compete

ciple is that exch'ange fluctuations designed for
immodiate commercial advantage are opposed
to the spirit of stability of the International
Fund. What we and ail other countries are
supposed to do is to produce articles on, a fair
and reasonable basis, in accordance with fundamental iaws, and not resort to easy ways of
doing business, because neither we nor any
other country can get away with that kind
of thing; it is a game at which two can play.
On February 18, 1946, the Economic and
Social Council of the United Nations resoived
to cai an international conference on trade
and employmnent to promote the expansion,
production, exehange and consumption of
goods. This is the conference which began in
Havana on November 21 and is stili in progress. In the interval, a preparatory committee bas been at work preparîng a draft
charter for consideration at this conference.
This charter wouid set out a body of rules for
the conduct of international trade and the
establishment of the I.T.O. This preparatory
committee of the Economie and Social Council
of the United Nations consisted of ail of the
eighteen nations on the Economie and Social
Council, excepting Russia, which refused to
tace part. The committee held. sessions at
London in the fali of 1946, and in Geneva
during the past summer. At London the
United States took the lead in proposing a
draft charter for the I.T.O., and it is this basic
document, modified by the views of the other
members, which has finaily emerged in the
form in which it is now being considered at
Havana. Its text appears on page 7 of the
second report of the preparatory commîttee,
which I believe has flot yet been distributed
to honourable senators.
The charter-that is, the general one which
was under consideration at Havana-consists
of nine chapters of a hundred articles. They
cover the whole range of international economnic relations. While recognizing the .problems -of the immediate transitional period, in
many compromise and escape clauses to which
my honourable friend the leader of the opposition has correctiy referred, they commit the
nations to the eventual elimination of restricHon. Mr. HORNER: "Embargo" is a better

ion here would demand that this unfair
competition be met by some retaiiatory aotion
on the part of our government.
I believe, honourable senators, that there i8
no royal road to the successful achievement
of an export market. Some temporary advantage may result from a depreciation of currency, but the whole history of commercial
transactions proves that the benefit is transitory and iilusory, and that it only creates
further instabiiity. What our country and
other countries have to do is produce articles
as cheaply as possible, and give service in
the selling of them. Producing and seliing
should be donc in such a manner as to avoid
stîrring up public opinion in the country in
which we seli. Otherwise our efforts can oniy
resuit in some retaliatory action.
Taking the long-term view of our position
as an exporting country, it would be of great
advantage to be able to look forward to a
period of reasonable stabiiity. That wouild
not mean that if need should arise we could
not ask for and secure assistance under the
terms of the International Fund agreement.
Shouid our cost of production and price level
reach such heights that we could not seil to
the American market, for instance-which is
the reverse of the situation with respect to
some other countries--we might reasonabiy
ask for relief from what is referred to as a
fundamental disequilibrium; and it could be
corrected by a depreciation of our dollar
value. We do flot think today that our dollar
value is too high; the position is exactiy the
reverse. Our ability to seil in export markets
is iargely of our own making. As the leader
of the opposition pointed out, the reason we
do not ship cattle, wheat, lumber, and many
other commodities to the United States market is flot that our price ievei is too high to
enable us to do so, but that the Government
of Canada, rightly or wrongly, has thought it
proper up to the present time to require an
export permit, the objeet being to regulate
the amount of goods left in this country.

SENATE

that a concrete step in this direction be taken
at once by the leading trading nations. The
preparatory committee welcomed this proposal
and agreed to sponsor negotiations at its
Geneva meeting for mutual tariff reductions
and the narrowing of preferences, to be conducted concurrently with its drafting of the
charter of the I.T.O. The outcome of these
difficult negotiations is the general agreement
on tariffs and trade, signed by twenty-three
nations, and applied provisionally by eight
nations as of January 1, 1948.
Not only have all nations agreed to make
substantial tariff reductions, as set out in the
twenty schedules annexed to the agreement-that is twenty individual schedules setting
forth what each country agrees to do-but
they have also bound themselves to apply the
commercial provisions of the draft charter set
out in part II of the general agreement when
the agreement comes fully into force. In the
meantime, until nations representing 85 per
cent of the total trade of the signatories have
ratified the agreement, the eight nations who
have signed the protocol of provisional application are bound to implement, so far as they
can within existing laws. part Il of the agreement, which has to do with general commercial
practices.
I was recently asked by an honourable
senator what effect the discussions in which we
have taken part will have on the question of
the production and sale of margarine and our
prohibition of the importation of this commodity. Under article XI of the general agreement we are bound to remove our ban on the
import of oleomargarine. The product is not
specifically menti.oned, but we have bound
ourselves to abstain from prohibitions of that
nature. At present, however, the general agreement is in force only among those nations
which signed the protocol of provisional application; and even then, part II of the agreement, in which this provision appears, need be
implemented only to an extent not inconsi6tent with existing legislation. Consequently
we need not change our law concerning the
importation of margarine until either one of
two things happens: (a) that the general agreement comes into force as provided in article
XXVI, by the deposit of the instruments of
acceptance by nations representing 85 per cent
in volume of trade of the signatories, or (b)
the draft charter of the I.T.O.. which also contains this provision, is accepted by the Havana
conference and comes into force, superseding
the general agreement.
Trade-restricting devices-other than tariffs
-must be eliminated sooner or later. These
include discriminatory internal taxes, special
transit requirements, improper use of dump-

ing duties, arbitrary valuation for customs
purposes, misuse of customs regulations and
administrative discretion, arbitrary import
restrictions, misuse of state trading, undue
protection of local industries, and discriminatory exchange restrictions.
The agreement which we are now asked to
approve is designed to stand by itself in case
the draft charter now under consideration at
Havana is never ratified, and a procedure is
set out to cover such a situation. There is
every reason to believe, however, that the
majority of the nations at the Havana conference will ratify the draft charter, especially
if it is decided to confine the benefit of the
tariff concessions to the "members of the
club." That, I believe, is the term which best
expresses the situation.
This agreement,
which is not directed against any country, is
worked from stage to stage. It represents the
thought of people who have interests in common and who want to unite as far as possible
to deal positively with this very important
question-a question upon which action is
almost universally agreed to be desirable but
in practice has been hard to bring about. It
means that a certain number will agree; and
it is hoped that others, as their views change,
will also join. Those who are in it will have
extended to each other, of course, and only
to each other, the most-favoured-nation treatment. In tihat case, if the charter is agreed
to, the provisions of the general agreement
would be superseded by the relevant parts of
the I.T.O. charter when the latter came into
force. The general agreement does not prevent Canada from directly negotiating further
tariff reductions with a country such as the
United States, so long as the concessions made
are granted generally to other countries. This
is the most-favoured-nation principle, already
standard in the usual trade agreement.
Honourable senators, I realize that my presentation of this very important subject has
been imperfect, and I should like you to
think that I have only attempted to lift the
veil on the importance and far-reaching significance of it. As mover of this resolution, I
should like it to be understood. I do not
anticipate that this matter is going to be
resolved during the next two weeks or two
months, but only when parliament has had
whatever time it deems necessary to consider it.
There is a wealth of information which
can be secured from the Canadian negotiators
of these agreements. It would be absolutely
out of the question for me to endeavour to
impart such information. The only practical
method the Senate has of securing information
on such matters as this is by referring them
to our standing committees; and I am sure

DECEMBER 11, 1947
that honourable senators would welcome the
opportunity of obtaining knowledge of this
subject in that way. I am going to suggest,
therefore, that this be done. But I do not
wish to be misunderstood. I shall welcome
discussion; indeed, I would ask the indulgence
of the house so that I may be given another
opportunity to speak on this matter after I
have heard-not for the first time-what the
officials have to say about it.
I think at some early stage we should refer
the subject-matter of this motion to a standing committee, where we could hear such
officials as Mr. MacKinnon, who is thoroughly
familiar with all its ramifications and is in a
position to deal with all the multitudinous
details connected with various industries and
tariff schedules. In addition to officials of
the Department of Trade and Commerce, I
think we should invite the leading representatives of various Canadian industries to appear
before the committee to give their impressions
of the general agreement. I make this proposal because I feel that some honourable
senators might like to avail .themselves of that
infbrmation before they present their views.
It is my desire that the motion be introduced
at the earliest possible moment, so that there
may be the longest possible interval between
its introduction and the time when it will have
to be resolved and decided either in the
affirmative or in the negative.
As honourable senators are aware, the discussion on the Geneva trade agreements is
now proceeding in the other house. From what
I know of practice there, I imagine that when
that house resumes following the Christmas re,
cess, the debate on the Speech from the Throne
will probably take some weeks, and the tariffs
and trade agreement will not be approached
for some time. In the meanwhile I should
like honourable senators to have the most
complete information obtainable from the
officials of the Department of Trade and
Commerce and such other witnesses as honourable senators think should be called. In
the meantime the resolution can stand until
honourable senators see fit to proceed with it.
Hon. Mr. DAVIES: May I ask the honourable gentleman if there is any date by which
this resolution must 'be passed?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: There is no set
date. It is almost in the same category as
the Speech from the Throne. The actual date
of enforcement of these tariff schedules is
January 1, 1948, but parliamentary approval
need not be given until such time as parliament sees fit to give it. I 'believe that some
six weeks elapsed between the time the 1936

Canada-United States trade agreement came
into effect and the time that it was ratified
by parliament. There is really no time limit.
I am not laying so much stress on the iramediate schedules, because these things move
progressively; but my honourable friend the
leader of the opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig) has
said that because of many escape clauses in
the agreement, he was afraid it would be a
long time before it would function. In reply
to him I should just like to point out that
twenty-three nations have been seized of the
importance of doing something about the matter, difficult as the task may be.
In the past the Senate Standing Committee on Immigration and Labour has supplied
this country with valuable information on
matters of vital importance; therefore I would
suggest that this particular question be sent
to one of our standing committees. This
would serve a double purpose: it would give
honourable senators a greater appreciation of
the various aspects of the general agreement
and at the same time it would enable every
interested person throughout the length and
breadth of Canada to obtain whatever information was disclosed to the committee.
In considering this subject a host of questions enter the mind as to what its long-term
implications will be. For instance, my honourable friend from Medicine Hat (Hon. Mr.
Gershaw) brought up an important point in
relation to the opening of a market for cattle
in the United States. As I see it, if the
restrictions on the sale of cattle were removed,
our sales to the United States would be greatly
increased. It might be asked, "Then, why
not do it?" It is true that we want the
dollars and that our farmers want the business
-and I have no doubt that the Americans
would not object to getting the meat-but
there is a complication. There is the question
of how we can maintain an orderly control
of the cost of living, and minimize as mucn
as possible industrial unrest. It is probably
not beyond the ability of man to do this,
but it is a very interesting subject for consideration.
In the long run, reductions in the American
tariff will tend to bring the cost of primary
products in this country to par with the cost
in the United States. For instance, in future
the Canadian consumer may have to pay for
agricultural products much the same price as
Americans pay. If that happens, and if prices
of manufactured goods continue to be higher
here than in the United States, Canadian consumers will be placed in a very difficult
position.

SENATE

That raises the question of how far it
might be possible to integrate the manufacturing industries of the two countries with a
view to making manufactured goods available
!n Canada at the same prices as in the United
States, while at the same time holding and,
if possible, enlarging the volume of our own
manufactures.
The agricultural implement
industry is an instance which shows that this
is not impossible. I understand that today
there is no tariff on the entry of agricultural
implements from either country into the
other. Honourable members who are more
familiar with the business than I am will
know whether implements of the same types
and quality are manufactured in both countries. Of course, if I were making an election
speech in Nova Scotia or in the Canadian
West, I would say, "Take the tariffs off manufactured goods altogether and let them come
in." But the matter is not so simple as that,
as honourable senators know.
I believe we are entering into a period of
changed industrial and business relations
between Canada, the United States, Great
Britain and other countries that think and
believe as we do. It seems to me that the
economic position of these countries has got
to be integrated. And I say to honourable
senators that many people believe that under
these circumstances there is perhaps no more
favourable manufacturing area in the world
than the peninsula of Ontario. People for
whose judgment I have great respect have
said within my hearing that the time will
come wvhen that part of Canada will be the
Ruhr of the new world. It has every advantage as a source of industrial power, and if it
had the benefit of a much larger market Canadian consumers might be able to buy manufactured goods at the same prices as prevail
in the United States. That is a matter of
serious importance.
In normal times trade in this country and
the United States has been carried on between
individuals. But we are entering into trade
agreements and expect to live beside and
trade with-and indeed, if necessity arises,
fight alongside-countries in Western Europe
whose economies are and will likely continue
to be, to a greater or lesser extent, on a
different basis. These countries now and in
the future may obtain their full requirements
through state trading and bulk purchase.
How can we reconcile our method of doing
business with theirs? Remember, honourable
senators. in Western Europe today the socalled conservative governmmnts are socialists, who, rightly or wrongly, believe in state
trading and bulk puirchase. As my friend

from Northumberland (Hon. Mr. Burchill)
knows. the lumber business in eastern Nova
Scotia has had an experience of that sort of
thing. It may become a permanent method
of trading. I think there could be a most
useful inquiry into how we are to reconcile
the two different viewpoints. Mr. MeKinnon
said to us, as he no doubt will say again
when he appears before honourable members,
that one of the problems that arose in the
negotiations was how to draft terms for fair
dealing between countries that do bulk buying
and countries whose business consists of individual transactions. For the last eighty or
one hundred years or more Nova Scotia has
been seiiing most of its apples to the United
Kingdom, but today not one of our apples is
going there. The reason is not a tariff, but
simply that the government of Great Britain
decided that the purchases should be discontinued. My honourable friend from Northumberland, I think. has found also that the
British government said it did not want any
more lumber from the Maritimes.
Some consideration must be given to the
reconciling of bulk trading with individual
trading. A friend of mine in the East said to
me, when I was down there recently: "This
agreement may lead to a great increase in the
sale of our goods to the United States, and
a temporary advantage; but I do not like it,
because in my opinion the American market
is not as stable as the United Kingdom market. The official viewpoint in the United
States often changes with a change in administration. One government lowers the tariff,
but its successor raises it again." There is
room for a good deal of argument about that,
but I think that here again we are facing new
conditions. In recent years political thought
in the United States has undergone considerable revision. That country has been placed
in a position of virtual leadership in the
restoration of the world's economy. Today it
is contnmplating steps for 'puring the economic house of western Europe in order. It
is the only country that can do the job. Is it
conceivable that after the job is done the
American government would say to the people
of western Europe. "We have built your factories and helped you to start up in business
again. but we refuse to buy any more goods
from you"? That would not make sense; that
is a policy which simply could not work in
future.
To my mind it is significant that the two
great political parties of the United States
are involved in its present course of action.
There is a Democratic administration, but the
Congress is under Republican control. While

DECEMBER 11, 1947
the immed-iate course of action resuits from
powers that were given to the President,
nevertheless I think that the Republican as
well as the Democratic party bas a greater
appreciation of the fact that from political
and economic points of view it la absolutely
necessary for the United States te have
mutually satisfactory arrangements with countries that tihink and believe as it does. Today
neither the United States for any other nation
can wrap a cloak around itself and say, as
might have heen said twenty or thirty ycars
ago, that it is not interested in the rest of
the world, We must realize that changes have
taken place in Great Britain with respect to
credit and materials, and that the future may
bring stili further changes. For instance,
many of the overseas resources and investments from which Britain received the income
ta huy more goode than she sold have been
lest. From our point of vîew sh-e may net
be the readýy market she bas heen in the past.
I believe we should give careful consideration
to the questions surroun-ding the- stability of
mnarkets.
In view of the close relationship between
the economies of Canada and the United
States, I personally regret that the members
of our Parliament and the members of their
Congress, are only remotely acquainted. I
arn the government leader in the Senate and
a member of the government, but 1 must
confess that it was only through the recent
United Nations meetings that I made the
acquaintance of two members of the United
States Senate. Previous to those meetings I
did not know one American senator. I would
go so far as to say that the matter of trade
sbould he a suhject for discussion hetween the
legisiators of the two countries. After ail,
the representatives of the people in the United
States are, like ourselves, men of good will,
and 1 think we should know more about tiheir
problems and they should be more familiar
with ours. *In the final analysis it is public
opinion which decides these important matters.
Honourable senators, I believe I have contributed ail I can to this debate. It wiIl be
observed that I have scarcely touched upon
the details of the agreement. Again I suggest
that I couid make the detailed information
availabie to honourable members in a more
effective manner if the subjeet-matter were
referred to a committtpe.
In conclusion may I say that I believe that
Canada's future, and particularly that of my
native province of Nova Scotia, is completely
tied up with world trade. It must be remembered that the trend of the nations of the
world, particularly the great trading nations
bordering on the Atlantic ocean, is towards a

customs union. If as a resuit of trade strangulation we, a maritime country, have lost our
primary trade position, and fail to take advantage of the present trends, which we hope
mean something, we wiil have nobody to
blame in future but ourselves. Canada is flot
on the fringe of the economîic unit, but is
virtually in the centre of world activities.
*Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. JOHN T. HAIG: Honourable mcmbers, in my few remarks I wish to deal firat
with the closing commenta of the honourable
leader of the government. I cencur in his
suggestion that this resolution should be
referred to a committee wbere we could hear
the representatives and officials of the government who did the actual work of arranging the
agreements. I would go a step further, and
suggest that business organizations and others
throughout Canada should have their representatives appear hefore us and explain how
the agreements will affect them.
I notice hy the Debates of the House of
Commons that a committee of that bouse bas
heen proposed to consider this same problem.
Why could we not have a joint committee on
this subi ect, as we have had on other matters?
In that way we would secure wider publicity
and a better understanding of the probleme
existing throughout Canada. As I understand
the practice of the other house, the general
cemmittees are not set up until after the
Speech from the Throne is disposed of. If
this joint committee were te ait while the
other bouse is engaged in debating the Speech
frlom the Throne, there would he less interference fromn other committees.
I appreciate the very exhaustive history of
tariffs and agreements which has been given
by the bonourable leader of the government.
After some consideration of the agreements I
must admit that they require a great deal of
study. It would seem tha;t when regulations
are made they are accompanied by escape
clauses. 0f course I can understand that in
the preparation of the agreements our negotiators, in order te gain something. had to
make certain concessions, and it may be that
these escape clauses were necessary. We al
appreciate that frequently it is not tarîff walls
that keep our goods out of other countries, but
rather the regulations within those countries
with which we cannot comply.
The honourable leader bas pointed eut that
Great Britain, France and other counitries
whose governmcats arc doing bulk buying
may say, "We have agreements with Canada.
but we are not going to buy ber goods." 1
have ne insidie information, but I understand
that negotiations with respect te trade agreements between Great Britain and ourselves

SENATE

are proceeding at the present time. My information is thet Britain is willing to continue the wheat and cheese contracts, but
is flot very keen about buying butter, bacon,
eggs, poultry and other commodities which we
have in abundance and are ready to sell. Ail
these questions should be considered, because
the people of Canada are enxious for a wider
world trade.
I repent what 1 said yesterday, that in
Canada three out of eight persons are engaged
in producing or manufacturing for trade purposes. At the saine time there is an ingrained
feeling here that we rmust protect our people
against exploitation of one kind and another.
It is felt that the men and women of this
country who work with their hands must be
protected against the lower living standards
whiehi prevail in other 'countries. That is
fondamental in our people.
The honourable leader of the goverrument
pointed out that we might adopt an agreement which, for instance, would be satisfactory
.to the Maritimes and the Prairie Provinces,
but which would be strongly opposed by
Ontario, Quebec and British Columbia. We
must survey the wbole field and decide what
agrecment is best in the interest of the country
as a whoie. In order to get the best agreement we must do as the negotiators did at
Geneva-make concessions.
1 am flot as enthiusiastic about tbe American
market as is my bionourable friend. 11e may
be right-possibly there is a change in the
attitude of the people of that country-but
I believe progrcss in the matter of markets
ivill be slow. There is a rising tide of sentiment in the United States which may carry
the Republican party into office next fail. If
that should bappen, the element which believes
in protection for its own people only will be
in the ascendancy. Wliether outstanding men,
sucb as Senator Vandenburg, cen hold back
that tide, I do niot know. I hope they can.
I am in whlni-hearted agreement witb the
suggestion that this matter should be referred
to a committee, and in saying this I amn sure
I speak for the members of ýthis side of the
house. We are for worlýd trade, not omly
because it is beneficial in itself, but for the
reason that we bolieve it will help the cause
of peace. I wan that to be clearIv undcrstood.
At the saine time, while supporting the reference of this subject to a committee, or whatever other procedure the government leader
bas in mmnd, I a.sk, flot oniv for myscîf and my
associates, but for the people of Canada, that
there shaîl be a foul and complete investigation of the agreements. They w-ilýl be much
more effeetix ely suppoýrted if the people of

Canada know what tbey are and what they
are, designed to do. In committee we must
not be afraid to criticize, and we must welcome criticism, so that ail the problems
involved may be tboroughly understood. I
repeat that I heartîly support the idea of
sending the question to a committee, and I
suggest to tbe leader that ýthe chairman of
whatever committee he selets--

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON:

The Canadien

Trade Relations Committee.

Hon. Mr. HAIG: -should get in tou-ch
witb the appropriate persons in the other
place and s-ce whether a joint arrangement
cannot be made for the consideration of the
agreements.. Thereby public money and the
time of officiaIs would be saved, and the
importance of the investigation increesed.
Hon. NORMAN P. LAMBERT: I wish to
take *a moment or two of the time of the
bouse to refer
aspect--

to

one

outstanding

general

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: May 1 interrupt
my honourable friend? It bas occurred to me
that bonoureble senators wbo speak now on
this general agreement may tbereby deprive
tbemselves of tbe rigbt to speýak on it at a
later stage. The thought is in my mi.d and I
submit. it for consideration, tbat I should ask
leave to revert to tbe item of "Motions", and
move tbat tbîs matter be referred to the
Standing Committee on Canadien Trade Relations. Tbis would eneble honourable senators
who wisb to speak et this time to speak on the
motion, and et the same time it would preserve
their rigýht to discuis -the present resolution
after they bave had further information. The
resolution itself could stand adjourned, perhaps et tbe instance of my honourable friend
opposite. Then, should anybody now wishi to
discuss the subjeet generally lie could speek on
the motion of reference witbout being precluded from. discussing the generel resolution
leter on.
Hon. Mr. CRERAR: Tbeat would bie ýail right
if His Honour the Speaker would -llow us the
necessery latitude. Tbere if mucb to commend
the suggestion of the leader of the government, but I would point out tbet a resolution
to refer the subi cet-matter to e committee
searcely provides sufficiently wide scope for a
discussion of the merits and demerits of tlîe
proposed agreement. However, the course suggested is quite satisfectory to me. I hope that
in s>o expressing myseif I ar n ot exheusting
my right to speek on the agreements.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON:
I do not think
we nced be unduly technical. It sems to
me that, with the permission of His Honoor

DECEMBER 11, 1947

the Speaker and the house, honourable senators could again speak on the subject after
they have received much more information
than it is possible for me to impart. Unless
some honourable senator objects, I do not
see any particular reason why His Honour
could flot permit us to go fairly far afield,
without prejudice to our right to speak again
later. I do not know the viewpoint of the
leader opposite.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: As far as I am concerned, I joîn with the Leader of the Goverament and the honourable senator from
Churchill (Han. Mr. Crerar) in asking His
Honour to waive any rule which would prevent the widest discussion of this mat ter. If
the honourable member for Ottawa (Hon. Mr.
Lambert) wishes to do so, I would let him
speak now, and again later on.
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: I am very grateful
to the house for its generous disposition in
relation to the few remarks I want to make.
I would preface them by the com-plete and
positive statement that I am today as much
in favour of adopting the proposed agreement
contained in this international charter as I
shall be when we have finished this discussion.
On the general aspect and significance of
the whole agreement, I wish to point out,
hionourable senators,'that when in 1945 we
dealt with the Unit'ed Nations charter, which
came to us from San Francisco, we were l*ooking forward ta a world safeguarded for peace
and security. In approaching the Geneva
charter, our ideal is precisely the samne. This
Geneva charter is the work of the specialized
agency called the International Trade Organization, one of the developments of the United
Nations organization, and it should be followed
by the adoption of the principles underlying
it.
I think that the significance of these agreements should be considered from. the point of
view I have mentioned. The Economîc and
Social Council of the United Nations was9
oharged, under the articles numbered LV ta
LXIV, with the very work that has been
undertaken by this international trade organization at Geneva, and its basis is the idealism
which led to th~e bringing together of the
various nations of the world at San Francisco
in 1945.
The proposaI to draw Up a charter for international trade originated in the fourth and
fifth principles of the Atlantic Charter, which
was drawn up hy the late President Rooseveit and Mr. Churchill in August, 1941; and
I want ta put on Hansard those two principles,

in order to give the real background of the
projeet which we are about to consider. They
are as follows:
Fourth, they will endeavour, with due respect
for their existing obligations, to further the
enjoyment by ail states, great or small, victor
or vanquished, of access, on equal terms, to the
trade and to the, raw mnaterials of the world
which are needed for their econondc prosperity;
Fifth, they desire to bring about the fullest
collaboration between ail nations in the economie
field with the abject of securing, for ail, improved labour standàrds, economie adjustmnent,
and social security.
The principles enunciated in those two articles
were incorporated in article VII of the
Anglo-United States boan agreement, and the
saine idea, appeared in the special clause
which is included in eve.ry Iease-lend agreement entered into by this country, the United
States andi Great Britain during the war.
Therefore, the whole outlook of the allied
cauntries, led by the United States and Great
Britain and with the full co-operation of
countries like Canada, was to the time ahead
when economic recovery and social security
could be adopted in such a charter as this.
It should also be stated that shortly after the
United Nations Charter was evolved at San
Francisco on December 21, 1945, the State
Department of the United States published
the proposed details of the charter that is now
before us. Eighteen nations were invited to
join the United States in negotiating a multilateral trade agreement, and it was found
expedient at that time to have the United
Nations Economic and Social Council take
charge of the proceedings. A preparatory committee was instructed to prepare a charter for
an international trade organization; and this
charter was ultimately to be presented to the
World Conference on Trade and Employment,
which began its work in London, England, in
1946, carried on until October of this year
in Geneva, and then adjourned to the date of
the meeting that is now being held in Havana,
Cuba.
This charter is the result of a most intensive
study by hundreds of government specialists
from the seventeen different countries represented in this agreement, and is for the purpose
of bringing about a compromise document.
While the charter is obviously a compromise
document, it nevertheless is the deliberate
judgment of every government represented at
the Geneva Conference as to what each of
them would be likely to expect in providing
for a world trade basis for international economic co-operation, and I feel that what is now
before us in the form of a proposed basis for
enlarging world trade is a far more historic
document than the majority of us realize.

SENATE
The world has failed to appreciate the value
off any of the great political objectives which
were expressed in San Francisco at the United
Nations Conference, but it has at least lived
to see this very practical suggestion evolved
from the aspirations and idealism of that
time.
In spite of the very spectacular and interesting discussions that took place at the last
two meetings of the General Assernbly-and
I hope at a later date .my colleagues who
were in attendance at New York will have
sometbing to say about those meetings--I do
not consider that anytbing whicb occurred
during the proceedings compares in importance
witb the development that bas taken place
under the auspices of the International Trade
Organization, whichi is one off the specialized
agencies of the United Nations. ln my opinion
the Genev a Charter. which is to be followed by
the more gcneral prrnciples embodied in the
Havana Charter, represents a practical road
to world peace. This document is equal in
importance and in every respect to the United
Nations Charter, which paýsed both bouses
of our parliarnent in 1945. In dealing .vitha
it we nav well feel that we stand at a
very important and critical point in the history
off this country and of the wbole world. I do
not particularly desire at any time to deal at
any great length witb the tariff details and
provisions which are included in the various
sehedules of the charter. The fact is that it
lays a basis for the evolution of a new world
out off a very drastically cbanged one; and
any person who bas tried to maintain an
objective and detached view of wbat has gone
on throughout, aIl the continents-not, only
during the war but immediately after itmust realize that the world has cbanged.
The United States gave leadership to this
movement for wider tradte, and initiated the
proposais: and it ivas under the auspices of
that country that the first conference took
place. It bas shown a most generous and wise
attitude towards the adoption of a policy
wbich will carry out some of the idealismn of
the late President Roosevelt and Mr. ChurchilI, as expressed in the Atlantic Charter.
If we can approach in the proper spirit the
adoption of the resolution or agreement which
has been so ably presented to this chamber
by the leader on this side, we shall at least
capture some of the true purpose of the recommendations whicb have corne to us ffrom
Geneva.
In conclusion I should like to pay trihute to
the representatives of this country who sat
in the ýGeneva conference and helped to work

out the details of the tariff agreements made
amongst the seventeen countries.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: In many years of
Canadian history I do not know of any work
that bas been accomplisbed that is more
important than the work donc by our delegates to Geneva. Headed by Mr. Wilgress,
Mr. MacRinnon and Mr. Deutsch, they gave
six months off their time, patience and ability
to achieving sometbing whrich other countries,
sucb as the United States, have recognized,
by giving Canada bier full share of credit.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: I do not, know off
any work donc by representatives of our civil
service which compares wvitli the contribution

made at the Geneva conference by the men
I have named. This charter is a sort of
glorified jigsaw puzzle composed of fragments
off the debris and devastation that have covered the world since the war, and the
comýpleted picture represents the beginning off
decency and normality for human beings in
the years to corne.
Hon, W. RUPERT DAVIES: Honourable
senators, I wish to express my appreciation off
the excellent and able manner in which the
leader off the government (Hon. Mr. Robertson) presen-ted the résolution to us this
afternoon. I should like to say too that I fullv
agree
with
the
commendation
by
the
honourable senator from Ottawa (Hon. Mr.
Lambert) of the good work donc by the civil
servants ivho represented Canada at Geneva.
I migbt mention that when this group off
officials went to London a little over a year

ago, I crossed on the saine ship, and every
mornieg and affternoon they held sittings at
which they worked away at, the presentation
they wero going to make on Canada's behaîf.
They are rnost earnest, sincere and patriotic
Canadians.
My principle reason for rising et this time
is to ask the honourable lender if lie can tell us
what is going to be the position as to trade
with Russia. Is this general agreement being
made by a number off nations whicha will more
or less trade among thcmselves and leave
Russie and hier satellite countries out off the
picture altogether? What exactly wiîl be our
position as to trading with Russie when the
resolution now before us bas been passed and
the general agreement is completed?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I think that ouiposition as to trading with Russie wiIî be no
different fromn what it is today. Her exports

DECEMBER 11, 1947

ta this country or the United States, or to any
other country signing the general agreement,
would be subject to a higher tariff than would
those of a country that is a party ta the
agreement.
Hon. Mr. QUINN: Is the door not open ta
lier?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Yes, and ta hier
satellites. The countries of western Europe
are negotiating at present. Russia herseif is
flot, but the door is open ta hier. If she does
flot participate ini any agreement she will nat
have the advantage of the favoured-nation
treatment that shie would otherwise receive.
Hon. Mr. DAVIES: Would that attitude
by Russia more or less militate against some
of the large manufacturers of this country?
Years ago the Massey-Harris Company, for
instance, was a big exporter ta Russia, and
for ail I know it stili may be. How would its
business with Russia be affected as a result of
this general agreement?
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: That company would
be in the samne position, I should say, as a
manufacturer in Great Britain that desired ta
trade with Russia. The fact that Russia is not
participating in this general agreement made
at Geneva would have no effect upon possible
trade between that country and Canada.
Hon. Mr. QUINN: Russia wauld be in the
same position as any of hier campetitors,
would she not?
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: Yes.
Hon. T. A. CRiERAR: Honourable senators,
we are ail indebted ta the leader of the gavernment (Han. Mr. Robertson) for the comprehensive review that hie gave when intraducing this very important resolution. Ia the
troubled state of the world today there is no
surer way of promatiag the relationships that
are necessary between cauntries, if peace is ta
be maintained, than by encouraging in every
way possible their trade and intercourse with
one another. That is why I agree with the
honourable senator from Ottawa (Hon. Mr.
Lambert) that the agreement referred ta in
the resolutian is of paramount importance
right naw.
In the formative years of my young manhood I was greatly influenced by Morley's
Lile of Richard Cobden. Cobden was one of
the founders of what later became known in
Great Britain as the Manchester scbaal, autl
while there has been a great deal of departure
from the theories of that school, I think that
in one respect they have stood the test of

time. Cobden's thesis was that there was no
surer preventive of war than f.riendly trade
between nations.
Hon. Mr. BURCHILL: Hear, hear.
That is just as
Han. Mr. CRERAR:
true today as it has been at any time in
history. If we had had a visitor from Mars
a few years after the last war I t-hiak hie
would have been amazed at, the rampant
growth of bath political and economic nationalism throughout the world. I arn bound ta
say that in my judgment the cauntry ta thie
south of aur borders failed greatly after the
last war. The honourable leader of the opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig) in his contribution ta
the debate expressed a doubt as ta the permanence that might be faund in any trade
arrangement that we made with the United
States, and rather ta my regret hie intimated
that we still must have regard ta the protection af aur industries in Canadia and the
maintenance of aur standard of living. I had
hoped that after his interjection yesterday in
the debate an the'Address hie had somewhat
changed his mind, and I thiak that on reflection hie probably will change it.
If we are gaing ta erect trade barriers on
this or that pretext, then the grand international purpase behind this resolutian will
fail; and I really think that if it fails, one of
the great hopes of the world taday wilI fail
with it.
It requires very little argument ta convince
one that what Canada necds mare than anything else is future markets. Canada is
a coun>try wit-h great potential resaurces, and
if she can find the markets for lier surplus
foadstuffs, timber, commercial metals, fish and
othier commodities which she is capable of
producîng, she will have established the surest
basis for an enduring prosperity.
If a lessan has been learned from the experiences of the past-and I believe that this
applies to the UJnited States more than ta any
other country-it is that trade is not a one-way
street: if a country is ta seil its produets it
must expect ta buy the prodjue of other
cauntries.
I feel that the fear expressed by the leader
opposite (Han. Mr. Haig) in his brief contribution ta the debate this aftcrnoon is not fully
justified. It is interesting ta look at the history
of the United States during the past forty
years. We had an opportunity ta negotiate
a good trade arrangement in natural products
with that country in 1911. I do not propose ta
thresh old straw, but 1911 is far enough back
ta afford an objective viewpoint. The trade
arrangement with the United States was agreed

SENATE

to by a Republican administration, head-ed
by President Taft. The Republican party in
that country, as everyone knows, were traditionally the high-protection party; but they
bad moved se far forwa-rd in their thinking
that as long ago as ýthirty-six ycars they were
willing to negotiate a vcry comprebensive
trade agreement with Canada.
The Republican party went out of office in
1912 and the Democratic party came in. One
of the first acts of the Wilson administration
was to introduce wbat was known as the Underwood tariff, wbich greatly reduced the dutios
on imports going into the United States, and
was of distinct advantage to Canada. It is
noteworthy that from 1911 until the Denincratic party wvent out of power in 1920 the
offer made hy the Taf't administration for a
rociprocal trade
agreement with Canada
remained on the statute books of the United
States, and it was flot until after 1920 that
it was withdrawn.
It is ýtrue that following the First World War
the United States retreatcd into an economlc
and political nationalism, to the great misfortune of the world. The failure of that country
to come into the League of Nations was probably the most serious single disastor which bas
visited the world since the close of World
War I. Had the United States in 1920 been
prcpared te play the part in ýworld affairs that
she is playing se admirably today-and 1 am
not saying this in criticism of the American
people or their govcirument-I think the events
of the past twenty-five years would have been
vastiy different.
When the Fordney-McCumber tariff, referred te by tle bonourable leader of the gevernment, was put on in 1922, the United States
retreat into isolationism was complote; but
in order te make it stili more secure the
Hawley-Smoot tariff, which further increased
American duties on goods froma the outside
world, was adopted in 1930.
The cffect cf Un'ited States tariffs was feit bv
France, Germany, Belgium and other European
countrios, and they in turn rai-sed their tarifs,
te almest unprecedented heights. Frem 1930
until the outbreak of the recent world war
practically every conceivable obstacle that
could be devised by the wit of man was put in
the way of the natural exchiange cf commeditics botween countries.
Aftcr 1930 the Democratie administration in
the United States, 'hcaded by President Roc-eveit and guided by that great Secretary cf
State, Mr. Hull, cndcavoured patiently te
îînde the damage that bad licen donc. The
trade agreement that wa" first arrangcd in Mr.
Bennett's regime in 1935, and carried through
te a censummatien after the present govera-

ment came inte office, was a result of the
efforts of Mr. Hull. ilonourable senators will
recall that the agreement was furthcr enlarged
and extended tbree years later, and was in
force at the outbreak of the war.
It is quite truc that under the present proposais we will lose some of our preferential
advantages in the British markct; on the other
band, 1 think we will get substantial concessions from the United States. 1 nced net
enumerate themn bore; they can be deait with
and tbcir value assessed when wc censider this
matter in cemmittce. I do helieve that on the
whole range of natural produets which Canada
bas te soul, including agricultural products,
livestoek, commercial metals, prodîîcts cf aur
fisheries, lumber, and many other things, we
get valuable concessions from the United
States.
1 emphasize wlîat I said a few moments
age, that the ail-important objective for tbe
Canadian people is the seeuring cf markets.
If we cannet sell cur produets we are bound
te have unemplcyment. And I repeat: wo
oaa only selI our products if we are preparod
te exehango tbom with other cuntries for
what tlîcy produce. Looking broadly at the
proposcd agreements I beliove that they contain definite advantages for Canada.
The honourable leader opposite spoke of
the escapo clauses. I regret that thore are
such clauses, and that this arrangement provides for a poriod cf only three years. In
that respect I believo we have te appreciato
the task wvbich faced the negetial ors, who
spent six montbs at Geneva-from March
until Octobcr-hammoring eut these agreemonts. I should liko te asseciate myseif with
what the honourable senator from Ottawa
(Honý. Mr. Lambert) lias said in tribute te the
finep ability (lisplayrd by the ropresen ta tives
cf Canada at that conference.
I should have liked te sec a littie more
empliasis placcd on the principlos undcrlying
trade. But when se large a mnmbor cf nations
as those reprcscnted at Geneva are assembled,
naturally their delegates have te kcop in mind
opinion back, home; and it may w-cIl be that
the progress made ai Geneva xwas as great as
was possible in the light cf the political conditions existing in the countries there represented. I hope that in our discussions cf thoso
very far-reaching proposais we shall take the
large. the broad and ospocially the long view:
we cannet afford te take any short-range view
in our judgment of wbat the goernmcot have
submitted te us. Problems cf dollar exehange,
geocral problems cf currency, and many otlier1
questions are hefore us at. the presont time.
I amo ccnvinccd tbat if the Canadian people
are givon a fair chance they cao, by the devel-

DECEMBER 11, 197
opment of their skill and their labour, produce the goods which will enable Canada to
trade its way back into a complete, full and
permanent prosperity; and that objective is
the very essence of the propoisais which have
been, submitted here.
Trade with Russia is very iargely a matter
for Russia herseif. She was invited to attend
the conference at Geneva. 'She ignored the
invitation. TJhat of course is her right. In
looking at the European picture today I
find one point of special significance.
We
bear a great deal of talk about the iron
curtain which separates eastern Europe-Russia and lier satellites-from western Europe.
I have a feeling tha.t in the end, economnic
forces will triumph over these manifestations
of political nationalism. Wliy do I say so?
East of the iron curtain in Europe are the
great food-producinýg areas of that continent;
west of it are Europe's great manuýfaoturing
areas. Sooner or later these satellite countries of Russia wiil be -more and, more interested in trying to exchange their prodiucts,
agricultural in character and in the main such
as we prodýuce, with the couatries which can
furnish themn with the m.anufactured goods
they need if they are to raise their standards
of living.
I fully agree with the suggestion of the
government leader that this resolution should
be referred to committee, where we can get
more in-formation about it.
I conclud& with this remark; that in these
trou'bled, days nothing is more important than
that we should promote in every 'friendily .way
we can the ciosest intercourse possible, in
matters of trade, travel and otherwîse, between our country and the other countries
of the worid.
Hon. ARTHUR W. ROEBUCK: Honourable senators, I woui'd feel that I liad been
negligent if I did not express my pleasure at
tlie resolution which lias been moved and the
subject-matter of which we are proposing to
refer. Ail my life I have 'been a free-trader;
I have maintained -that position in the great
stronghoid of pro-teotion, the city of Toronto,
and have neyer all-owed the ligit to go out.
I remember the liard tirnes through which
we passed when I was a very young boy on
the farm, and which were due to a change of
the United States tariff which s9hut, out, among
other ýthings, our barley and, our lambs. There
were liard times on tihe Canadian farms in
those late eighties and early nineties. My
mind revolted against the unf-riendly attitude
of our great neighbour to the eouth of us,
which brought poverty to my liousehold and
to our neighibours, because it prevented us

from shipping abroad. It was not until later
times -that we developed our alyiLity to ship
to the European market. Later, like my
honourable friend from Churchill (Hon. Mr.
Crerar), I read the lilterature on this subject.
I too read the Life of Cobden, and I remember being greatly impressed with the writings
of Adam Smith; but ciearest, and most
incisive of ail, was Henry George on protection and free trade. The clearness witli which,
these masters of economics proved their
propositions 'impressed my mind; and I have
always felt an impatience at' those seductive
failacies, of protection wherehy people lift
themfselves by their own boot-straps, make
themselves prosperous by tying their own
hands, increase their standard of living by
shutting out the gooda of other people, and
look upon trade as an offensive operation, aud
the sending of the commodities of other
na.tions to our country as an uadriendly act.
I have been a free-trader because I believed in
freedom. in the broadest possible way, and
because the phiIosophy of free trade seemed
so appealing, s0 clear, so obvious, and so full
of good wili.
I look upon this step, thougli a short and
mnaybe a haltinýg one, as a great change in
the viewpoints of the people of tihe world,.
I listened yesterday to the remarks of the
leader of the opposition, speaking on behlf
of the Conservative party, and when lie g.at
through 1 told him I intended to propose lus
name for membership in the free trade league.
H1e did not fait for that. He was just led away
by the -enthusiasm. of the moment to say a lot
of things whicli were true, but, as a party
leader, he hedged immediately, because lis
party has aiways pandered to the private
special interests that gain advantage by a
partial bondage of their fellow-men.
In the 1911 eiection I, as a young mancertainly younger than I am now-took as
great a part as I couid, and for six long wecks
spoke afternoons and evenings in advocacy of
free trade, or freer trade as it was proposed at
that time. Today, with the leader of the
government, I marvel at the inconsistency of
a leader of the Conservative party talking at
this time about the right of the Canadian
farmer to seii in the markets where lie can get
the highest price, but either hedging, or saying
nothing about buying in foreign markets where
goods are offered at the lowest price; as thougli
the one were not the naturai coroliary of the
other.
My lion ourable friend from Churchill voiced
regret that generai principles relating to
freedom of trade are flot expressed in the
documents before us, whidli consist for the
most part of changes in tariff solieduies. I too

SENATE

have been unable to appraise the importance
of the schiedules. It is impossible for one to
read them and really understand what they
mean; but I would cail the attention of my
honourable friend from Churchill (Hon. Mr.
Crerar) to the opening paragraph of the document called the Final Act, in which it is stated
at page 6:
Recognizing that their relations in the field
of trade andi economie endeavour should be
conducted with a view to raising standards of
living, insuring flli employmient and a large and
steadily growing volume of reai income and
effective payment, developing the fuil use of the
resources of the worid and extending the production anti exehange of goods.
It thon runs on to the detailed schedules of
this agreement. Thus it can be scen that the
document is not entireiy without a statement
of principle. It is for the purpose of bringing
these good thinýgs about that the negotiators
of this agreement propose the practical steps
they have outlined in their schedules. The
agreements are flot so important in themselves
as they are in the fact that tbey constitute a
first step. I could write an agreement myself
which would be much more satisfactory te me
than the one which is now before me; but let
us not forget that those who took part in the
writing of this agreement had te secure the
concurrence of the representatives of seventeen other nations.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: In these agreements
the first great stop has been taken towards a
more enlightened trade policy througliout the
world. This will lead te a second step, and by
successive steps we may achieve a world in
which men may buy and sell with one another,
and in that way lay the foundations of permanent peace.

Honourable senators, I am very happy
indeed te have the privilege of addressing myself te this measure, and te compliment the
leader of the gox ernment on his proposai te
submit this te a committee where we may
gain a better knowledge of the details.

TARIFFS AND TRADE

:JNITED NATIONS CONFERENCE AT GENEVAAPPROVAL 0F GENERÂL AGREEMENTREFERENCE TO COMMITTEE
Hon.
WISHART
McL.
ROBERTSON
moved:
That the standing committee of the Senate on
Canadian Trade Relations be directed to inquire
into and report upon the subject matter of the
general agreement on tariffs and trade, including the protocol of provisional application
thereof, annexed to the Final Act of the
second session of the Preparatory Committee
of the United Nations Conference on Trade
and Ernployment held at Geneva from April 10

to October 30, 1947, together with the comple-

mentary agreements of October 30, 1947, between Canada and the United States of America

and between Canada and the United Kingdom.
That the said committee be authorized to send
for persons, papers and records.
He said: Honourable senators, 1 éhould like
to make brief reference to two phases of this
motion.
First, on December 10 the Prime Minister
agreed, I believe at the suggestion of the
leader of the opposition in another place, to
withdraw his request that parliament sanction
the coniplementary agreements between Canada and the United States of America and
hetween Canada and the United Kingdom.
It is my intention at soine future date to
move a similar motion, so that our resolution
may lie in keepîng with that of the other
house. I have not the exact phraseology of
the arnended resolution before me, so I arn
now moving with the understanding that the
portion of it to which I have referred will
in due course be withdrawn.
Secondiy, for the benefit of honourable
senators who were not present on Thursday
last, I may say that 1 then suggested referring the subject-matter of these agreements
to the Standing Committee on Canadian
Trade Relations, so that honourable niembers
could secure more details; and that the cornmittee should cail before it Mr. Hector MacKinnon, Mr. Deutsch, and other governinent
officiaIs wlio were directly concerned with
the negotiations at Geneva, as well as ûnyone else who could throw light on the subject.
If the resolution is adopted, the officiaIs will
be available tomorrow. After consultation
with the chairman, I have taken the liberty

will be officially sent out if and when the

Senate approves of this procedure. I need
not emphasize the fact that every honourable
senator will be welcome at the meeting, and
I arn sure that a good deal of information
will lie forthcoming.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: May 1 ask who
is chairman of that comm.ittee?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON:
Honourable
Senator Euler..
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I take it that it is not the
intention to close up the matter tomorrow,
and that the proccedings probably will not be
completed
until
after
the
Christmas
adjournment.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: That is so. The
resolution will stand on our Order Paper, and
the meetings of the committee can continue
as long as thie committee sees fit.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Before the motion is car-

ried, may 1 express my hearty concurrence
in wliat the leader lias said. The people of
Canada, as represented by such bodies as
chambers of commerce, labour unions, railway
organizations, and business men should lie
encouraged to attend these meetings, to
present their views and, if necessary, propose
amendments. The agreement is so oomplex
that I doubt whether even an expert could
digest it ini a month. I believe that if a live
intercst were taken in tlie. work of the committce on this problem, it would lie greatly
to the advantage of the people generally; and
I amn very glad that the leader bas intimated
that lie will not try to have the committee
sessions concluded this week.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: It will lie for the
members of the committee to consider and
determine wliat they will do; but my own
opinion as a member of the committee, so far
as it may have any weiglit, would support

the continuation of the inquiry as long as
seems advisable. Honourable senators understand that at the moment the resolution for
approval stands adjourned in -the namne of the
leader of the opposition. That simply means
that it is adjourned pending the securing of
additional information.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: That is s0.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: If it should happen that after one or two sessions lionourable
-senators desire to continue -the debate on tlie
agreement, I see no reason wliy, with the
concurrence of the Senate, they sliould nlot

do sa. But -I repeat that, m -ar as.I amn concerned as a member of the committee, it is

SENATE

my view that the committee should continue
its discussions so long as it is felt that any
worth-while information is obtainable, and
that the resolution should not be disposed of
meanwhile.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: That is right.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: It remains on the
Order Paper.
The motion was agreed to.
TRANSITIONAL

McL. ROBERTSON
Hon. WISHART
moved:
That, whereas section seven of the Continuation of Transitional Measures Act, 1947, being
chapter sixteen of the Statutes of 194'7, provides that subject as thereinafter provided, that
act shall expire on the thirty-first day of
December, one thousand nine hundred and fortyseven, if parliament meets during Novenber or
December, one thousand nine hundred and fortyseven, but if parliament does not so meet it shall
expire on the sixtieth day after parliament
first meets during the year one thousand nine
hundred and forty-eight or on the thirty-first
day of March, one thousand nine hundred and
forty-eight, whichever date is the earlier: Provided that, if at any time while that Act is in
force, addresses are presented to the Governor
General by the Senate and the House of Commous respectively, praying that that Act should
be continued in force for a further period, not
in any case exceeding one year, from the time
at which it would otherwise expire and the
Governor in Council so orders, that Act shall
continue in force for that further period;
And whereas it is considered desirable to continue the said Act in force until the thirty-first
day of March, one thousand nine hundred and
forty-eight;
The following address be presented to His Excellency the Governor General of Canada:
To His Excellency Field Marshal The 'Right
Honourable Viscount Alexander of Tunis,
Knight of the Most Noble Order of the Garter,
Knight Grand Cross of the Most Honourable
Order of the Bath, Knight Grand Cross of the
Most Distinguished Order of Saint Michael and
Saint George, Companion of the Most Exalted
Order of the Star of India, Companion of the
Distinguished Service Order, upon whom bas
been conferred the Decoration of the Military
Cross, one of His Majesty's Aides-de-Camp General and Commander-in-Chief in and over
Canada.
May it Please Your Excellency:
We, His Majesty's most dutiful and loyal subjects, the Senate of Canada, in parliament
asembled, respectfully approach Your Excellency praying that the Continuation of Transitional Measures Act, 1947, be continued in
force until the thirty-first day of March, one
thousand nine hundred and forty-eight.
He said:
Honourable senators, the object of this
resolution is to extend to March 31, 1948.

the Continuation of Transitional Measures
Act, passed at the last session of parliament.
This is the Act under which certain emergency
powers, such as rent control and the remaining
price controls, are continued in force. The
necessity for extending the term of this
measure for a further three-months' period
arises from Section 7, which provides that
the expiry date of the Act shall be December
31, 1947, if parliament meets before that time.
Had parliament not been called before the
end of the year the Act would have remained
in force until March 31, 1948. All that this
resolution does is to put back the expiry of
the Act to the date on which it would have
expired had parliament not met until the
usual time in January. The period between
now and the end of 'March, 1948, will give
parliament an opportunity, after it reassembles in the latter part of January, to
consider a further extension of particular
emergency powers, or any other proposals
which may be placed before it for consideration.
Hon. T. A. CRERAR: May I ask, before
the motion is put, whether it is anticipated
that when parliament resumes legislation will
be brought in to further extend the powers
under this measure?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I am not in a
position at this time to make any statement
as to what measures may be brought forth.
I am not clear as to what statement may
have been made in another place with respect
to that point, but I am under the impression
that the Minister of Justice, in presenting
this resolution, intimated that whatever might
be continued would be incorporated into
permanent legislation. I am only speaking
from memory, but I think that is the purport
of his remarks. I beg the indulgence of the
house if I am wrong.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: That is what was said.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: Could the honourable leader of the goverunent give this house
some idea of how much of the order-in-council
legislation that was in force when we passed
the extension measure of last session still
remains in effect. I have a very clear recollection of the explanation given by the honourable senator from Vancouver South (Hon.
Mr. Farris) when that measure was before us.
He stated that the purpose of the extension
was to allow the government a sufficient
length of time to dispense with the orders in
a methodical way, and I think he expressed
the views of all of us when he said it was
not desirable that legislation of such a nature
be extended into peacetime. He expressed his

DECEMBER 15, 1947
regret that this type of rule existed, saying lie
feared that young men and wornen miglit
becorne inured ta it and forget the kind of
government that we liad prior ta rule by
I recollect that lie grew

sufficientiy claquent in the matter ta quate
the wvords of Pape:
Vice is a monster of sa friglitfui mien,
As ta be liated needs but ta be sean;
Yet seen too of t, familier witli her face,
We first endure, then pity, then embrace.
I was impressed with the aptness of the
quotatian. as weil as tlie trutli of the expression
at that tiine. It wouid be some satisfaction
ta me ta know that in the interval the government had rnade sorne progress in dispensing
with that kind of legisiation, and it would
be useful ta knaw also liaw much of it is still
in force,
We must of course vote for the extension;there is no question about that. It is oniy a
short extension, and the real debate wili no
doubt take place later on when the session
is resumed and the measure cornes before us
once more. But I repeat that it would be
sorne satisfaction ta know right now that sorne
progress has bean made alang the line I have
indicated.
lon. Mi. ROBERTSON: I arn sorry that
I have not that information at the marnent,
but I think I could readily secure it . I know
that a considerable number of orders in council wvhich werc in farce when the legislation
was passed have ceased ta function, and I
shall endeavour ta find out for rny honourabie
friend just haw many have been drapped and
howi many are stili in effect.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: 1 think it wouid lie
worth whiie ta have that tornorrow.
Han. JOHN T. HAIG: Honourabie, senators, like the honaurable senator from
TorontLo-Trinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck) 1 feed
that we have no option but ta vote for the
extension af this Act. I do not intend ta say
mucli just now, but I wish ta refer ta, anc or
two things that worry me. In the first place,
I arn wondering why the gavernment caiied
us into session at thîs time. I liave been
asking myself tliat question ever since I
received notice that parliament was ta meet
on December 5, and s0 far 1 have flot been
able ta answer it. If the session liad not
opened until late in January this resalution
wouid flot have been needed, for the Act
wouid autornsticaily have remained in effect
for at least sixty day. from that date, or until
about the end of Marcb.
Here i. another thing. For the lest elht
or nine mo»thu or, more a fierce struggie bias

been going on between several elernents in
the comrnunity as to prices and controls.
People who are on wages and salaries want
noa control on such incosnes, but they do want
controls on everything that they buy or use.
Another group think subsidies should be paid
in order to keep down the prices of certain
foods, such as miik and bread. 0f course,
there is a subsidy on bread now-paid, flot by
the people as a whoie, but by the poor old
farmer. Stili another group contend that
there shouid be contrais on ail primary products, but flot on things that the primary
producers buy. And finaliy, the primary producers themseives are waking up to the fact
that the prices that they receive for their
commadities are held down, while everything
they buy keeps on going up. I want to warn
the government that the prirnary producers
have begun ta find this out.
I arn oid enough-though I shauld flot
mention ageHon. Mr. BALLANTYNE:
Especially
today.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I arn oid enough ta
remember how prices soared after the First
Great War. But they did flot soar very long;
after a year and a haif or so they dropped,
and there was a return ta normal conditions.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: There was a
pretty good gavernment then.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I do not believe that
cornmodity prices will go back ta their oid
levaIs, because it is easier ta keep prices up
than ta reduce wages andî salaries ta what they
were. This situation -creates special hardship
for people who are an pensions and fixed
incarnes. A gaod many people depend upan
the incarne frarn the small capital that they
buit up 'by long years of thrift. They piaced
their savings in bond@, rnartgages, houses or
sarnething of that kind, and on retiring from
active rwork they figured that they had enough
ta give them a competence. When I was a
young man starting in ta, study Iaw, 120,000
was consîdered, a gaod arnount of money for
a man ta leave when he died; it wouid take
care of his widaw. But now the incarne frorn
that surn is abaut $550 a year. An oid age
pensioner gets $W6 a year-in my province
$420-so lie is pretty nearly as weii off as anyone who bas put by savings of 620,000.
We have been trying ta do something that
no country lias ever yet succeeded in doing,
namely, ta contrai ecanomic forces. [t xnay

this kind of thing. lias finally given up the
attempt. As I indicated at the outset, I arn
flot opposed to extension of the Act. But I
arn opposed to any attempt, at keeping an
equilibriurn between the contending classes
tbat I have mentioned. In any such attempt
the persons ljkelv to suifer rnost, are those who
in their kindness of hrart are seeking to do
what thev believe to be bcst, but which
experience shows is impossible. 1 was talking today to a young man frorn Vancouver.
There was a municipal election out there, and
a non-parti-in candidate, with lots of experience in couneil. polled 24,000 votes as against
more than 19,000 for a semi-communist. Wbat
wvas the issue? Opposition to increased streetcri fares-althougbi the proposed increase
would flot have been enougýh to take care of
the extra wages granted toe tbe railway men.
That kind of philosophy is rampant.
The
attitude tbat "a law that ivill protect, me at
v our expense is a good law" is gaining grouncl
ail over ibis country. We as a people, and
especially îbcse of us who are in parliament.
have got, to tbink this problern clear through
and flot be carried away by arguments on one
,.ide or the other.
It is sornctimes said that in the Senatc there
are directors of a large number of banks, trust
companies and corporations of one kind and
another. But wlîo ow'ns our corporations?
Who cwns the Canadian Pacific Railway, for
instance? Its slioreboldiers are scattered al
oer Canada. tbe United States and other
countrirs. Who owns our great banks? ilundreds of people cwn small numbers of shares
-two, ten. twventy shares. A corporation is
mainaged by a board of directors, men chosen
bccause tbry are considered to be capable of
gîving good management, and their tenure of
office largely depends on their efficiency.
1 did flot intend to speak so long. My purpose is to impress upon honourable members
the issue involved in thcse controls. Between
now and March 31 the leader of this bouse
will participate in cabinet meetings at whieb
the question of wbat controls shahl be continurd and wbat ones shaîl be dropped is
under consideration. I believe that if we bcd
flot bad controls at aIl we would find it
rnucb easier to get out of our present, troubles.
Honourable members of this liouse may disagree with me, but in spite of all tbe arguments iiphill and down dale, that is my belief.
The President of the United States said
recently that the putting back of controls
in bis country would amnount to police control.
That, is the effect of the regulations in Cana-da.
There ar'e certain people in my own city
wbo, because of the system of rent contre1 ,

are snooping around te see if somebody is
charging fifty cents a month more for refit
than be sbould. There are instances of men
wbo worked on the, railway, and wbo by tbrift
acquired homes of tbeir own and also bought
the property alongside: tbey lived in one
bouse and rented tbe other. Today if tlîe
manager, or tbe widow, looking after the
rented property is cbarging a couple of dollars
more a rnonth than is allowed, action is
taken; and if the regulations are being broken
a penalty of $25 and costs is irnposed. That
policy of police administration makes sneaks
out of next-door neighhours, who when somneone is cbarging a bigber rent than is allowed,
run and tell the authorities. That is the
effect of controls. There are families with
four or five childien in my city living on
incomes of $150, or perhaps $175, per montb.
How they get along witb the present bigh
cost of living is beyond my comprehension.
Men and women in social services tell me
tbat there is more bardsbip and poverty
among this class of people in our city today
than there was in the depression days.
I admit that, the goverfiment is faced witb
probleinq. and 1 arn not going te criticize it foi'
wbat lias been donc about controls in the past
six rnontbs. While I do disapp;ove of wbat, tbe
Minister of Finance bas ilene in some matters,
I believe be is making a real effort te overcorne great difficulties. For instance. I crit-icize lîim for the regulations affecting cals and
barley. I suggest Iliat action sbould have been
taken at the first cf August and lbe shoiild
be the first te adlmit it. But. I rpeat. lie is
making a real effort to get eut frei undrr
controls.
I do net beliex e the goveriment can sd
denly do away w~ith rent rontrols. Inin '
y
opinion the botter course would be te say
that in six montlis, a year, or at some definite
date in tbe future, the controls on refit would
corne off. If the geverfiment said that. and
stuck te it, tbe people would be prepared for
the lifting of controls. The date for rcrnoval
shoulcl be around the first of Julv. which is
the beýzt tirne cf the year te make the change.
Hon. Mr. DLTFF: Wbat dees rny bonourable
fi iend tbink cf provincial rigbts?
liou. Mr. HIAIG: Provincial riglits are being
interfered with, but the provincial governrnents
are conniving at these matters.
Honourable members rnay point te mafix
rases in wbicb refit control is helpful. But 1
contend tbat the lielp is only geing te mndi\ iiuals, andl affects onlv the penrscns invohved
in particular cases. Tbe difficulty is that when
a bouse becomes vacant it is immediately put

DECEMBER 15, 1947
up for sale. The argument is ail in favour
of the lifting of rent controls as soon as
possible. The labour people of Canada were
the flrst to demand that ceilings on salaries
he removed. I can appreciate that because
t hure are more tenants than landiords it is
difficuit for the government to remove the rent
regulations; but I believe that the sooner we
get away fromn control in aIl departments, the
sooner we will get back on an even keel and
be ready to face whatever issues Europe may
present to us.
I intend to vote in favour of the resolution.
Hon. J. J. KINLEY: Honourable senators,
I wish ta say a word or two arising out of
the remarks of the honourable leader opposite
(Hon. Mr. Haig). My ýhonourable friend bas
asked why we are here. 1 believe that questioni bas been asked before. We have been
told that this is not a special session, but that
parliament was called in December to clear
away a few things so that we could get a
better start in the new year. There was an
agitation t'hroughout the country to bave parliament ealled early, and I believe it came
fran 'the same persans who are now criticizing the government for ealling parliament.
There are t'hree important matters of business now before us. The first is the charter
for an international trade organization and a
general agreement on tarifas and trade. That
tapic i5 110W being discussed throughout the
caun'try. The second, is our dwindling reserve
of American dollars-a condition for which
there must be some provision. That is another
matter about which the pcople of this country
are conyerned. The third question of interest
involves the extension of controls which the
government thinka necessary in order that we
may have economic stability and progress.
Many members of parliament say that tiey
do not agree with this or that proposed
mea;sure; but they vote for it. I believe that
when one votes for something one is behind
it. I think that is-proof of the way in wbichi
the legislation now proposed will be received
by the people. If the public look at what bas
been done in parliament during the past two
or three years, they might well conclude that
we were unanimously in favour of government
proposaIs. Senators and members of the
House of Commons hrave agreed with the
government measures, and that 'they have
been well received generally is established by
the outoome of recent by-elections.
It appears ta me that the three important
pieces of legislation now before this bouse
are complementary, and that one cannot succeed without the others. We are now in
difficulties which are not of aur own making.
We were huying in the United States and
5853-5,1

49

selling o%-erseas. Now we must conserve and
supplement our American currency by restrieting unessential purchasing in the United
States and endeavouring to export more ta
that country.
The hackneyed expression "free enterprise"
bas been bandied around a good deal in the
past few years. I am in favour of free enterprise; but how can we have it under conditions as they now exist? There is an
abundance of currency, but a shortage of
materials. How can we have absolute freedam under such conditions, without aîlowing
a few people ta profit excessively at the expense -of the many? If this country is ta
pragress and have stability, we mnay need
controls over such necessities as food, clothing
and shelter. Food is the first requirement
of lîfe. Canada is a cold country, and we
must have an abundance of coal. Shelter alsa
is essential.
The honourable gentleman -from Medicine
Hlat (Hon. Mr. Gershaw) made a fine speech
the other evening in which he referred ta the
sending af Canadian cattle ta the United
States. I rather agree with the remarks of
my honaurable friend. The other day I saw
a statement in a United States newspaper ta
the effect that the Americans would welcome
more goods from Canada because, as a result
af shortages, they have inflation, and an
increascd volume af gaods from this country
would help ta reduce prices and counterset
inflation. But if we export large quantities
af aur produets ta the United States, and
a shortage develops in this country, what is
going to happen ta the prices which aur
people have ta pay?
Han. Mr. HORNER: How are yau going
ta campensate the men whose cattle have
been stolen from them?
Hon. Mr. KINLEY: I do not knaw what
the hanaurable senator refers ta when he

SPEECH FROM THE .THRONE
ADDRESS IN REPLY

The Senate resumed from Wednesday, Dc-

cember 10, the consideration of

is Excellency

the Governor General's speech at the opening

of the session and the motion of Hon. Mr.
Ferland for an address in reply thereto.
Hon. R. B. HORNER: Honourable senators,
this is one of the occasions when I ask the
indulgence of the house and assert my right ta
speak. Some honourable senators have remarked that tliey do not know why tliey have
corne down here. I am particularly anxious to
say a word or two now, because 1 know exactly
wvhy 1 came here. 1 wish to congratulate the
mover and the seconder of the Address in Reply
-particularly the seconder, the honourable
senator from Medicine Rat (Hon. Mr.
Gersliaw). I think he could tell you why he
came to Ottawa. I am sure that many farmers
in the Medicine Hat district hurried him on
his way; in fact, that they were very anxious
that he should have something to say to thie
house at this time. I feel that the honourable
senator from Medicine Hat empioyed very

moderate language indeed. He used the word
" harmony." Had lie been a different type of
man lie would have used the words "avaid a
revolution" instead of the word "harmony"
when referring to his part of the country. As
I say, lie vas very moderate when lie asked
that something be done to permit some of our
surplus cattie to cross over to tlie United
States.

Honourahle senators, I think perhaps 1 have
the first riglit ta speak in this chamber on
agriculture and farming and stock raising. It
inay ho that some hanaurable senators here
are equally qualified, but ever since I was a
yaung lad just, the right heiglit, standing up,
ta rnilk cows and to do a fair job of it, I
have been jnterested in livestock.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. HORNER: In referring ta this
industry, let me say that a real cattleman or
stockman viii lose money without a whimper
in many ways; but when hie loses money on
livestock lie finds it a very bitter pill ta
swallow. It is not exactly a question, of
money with hîm. It lias been said that a
good shepherd knows lis flock. So does a
good stockman; wlietlier lie lias a hundred
or a thousand, lie knaws oach individuaI liead
of cattle. This may bie an amazing thing ta
a person who does not understand Iivestock;
but the cattleman knows the expression on
the face of eadli individual animal, ani he
knows its uine of breeding, because lie lias ta
choose among the cattle and take out the
animais that are not making him money.
The farmers in most of Alberta have had
sufficient feed, but in aIl that great area of
the West camprising northern, Saskatchewan
and part of northern Alberta, where large
numbers of cattle were heing kept-far ive
can seoure sufficient water there-the crop
this year was almost a total failure. And at
just about the t.ime when there vas a littie
bit of feed lef t and we could have marketed
aur cattie, the strike of packing-house
workers began. I thouglit. as I am sure the
lionourable senator from Medicine Hat (Hon.
Mr. Gershaw) thought, that some governmental action would be taken; but in the
wliole country the only governiment that did
anything about the strike was the provincial
government of Prince Edward Island, whose
premier undertook ta open the stockyards.
For four or five weeks of the most important
season- the livestock producer was prohibited
from seiling lis cattle. Farmers in the nortih
had managed ta secure a littie feed, whichi
they intended for their best animais, the ones
tliey had set their hearts on as being the

DECEMBER 16, 1947
The bonourable sanator from Bladworth
(Hon. Mr. Johneton) said laet session thaf hie
thoogbf money was bad for farmers. I do not
fhink that the farmers act any worse wben
they have money than do any other class of
senafor from
Tbe bonourable
persons.
Medicine Haf (Hon. Mr. Gersbaw) said
recently in f hie bouse that the farmers' cost
of oparafion was up 25 per cent. 1 think thaf
is a very modarate eftimate. I believe the
figure is more like something between 200 »and
600 per cent. If works out this way: the
farmer lias f0 bire fwo or three men 'f0 do tbe
work of one and pay bim three times the wages
he ehould get. Honolirable senafors can figure
thaf out for fhemselvae. And thaf je nof, ahl;
just fry f0 hira a man.
As againet tbe position of tbe farmer let us
consicier that of the businessman who furnislhas the farmer wif h supplies. Through
the years lie bias been able to gef up any time
lie likes, and hie knows that everyfbing bie
lias will seli. He bias no real expenees, and
hae charges wbatever bis fancy dictafes. During this pasf summer I paid as higb as $2.25
a bag for cernent, and I know corne otbers

wbo paid $3. The merchant did not bave f0
do any selling to gef rid of t he cernent-be
kepf if lîidden, and the facf thaf bie hiad it
was a secret.
Ma ' I illustrata fbe practices of the businessman who dlaims f0 be serving the farmer?
A certain marchant got in a stock of fwelve
emaîl engines, similar to tbe type one would
use for pumping water. He displayed the
twelve angines. all in a row, and was quit e
proud of fhem. A farmer came inf o bis shop
and asked about geffing an engine. The
marchant replied thaf hae had twelve of fhem
and thaf hae could supply bim. The farmer
finally dacided that, as hae bad gof -along
without an engine s0 long, hae would flot buy
one. The sliopkeeper, realizing thaf the day
of scarcities bad passed, decided f0 bide al
the angines but one. When 'the nemif prospective purcliaser came in hae was f nid that
fieangine in the sbop, and
there was one litt
lie immediately decided to f aka it. Thaf is
tbe psychology of ecarcity, bonourabla s9enafors, and thaf is whaf the farmer is up againef
in evarvthing hae goas to buy. As to hired
men, there is easier work available and if is
impossible t0 get balp.
If seems f0 me thaf the law of common
sensa sbould be applîad fo some of tbe problems facîng the farmar. What is the position
of thle hog producer when hae bias an animal
thaf is a pound or two overweighf. Nof -only
doas hae lose the pramiom, but hae is docked
82. Ha is penalized f0 the cama extent

53

when the hog is a pound or two light. But
when the consumer goes to buy bacon does
hie ever say: "Give me some bacon off that
hog that was a pound overweight, and 1 will
take it at two or three cents less." Did you
ever hear of anyfhing so ridiculous? Yet the
right honoura-bla gentlemen in the other place
would have the farmer subjacted to such
unreasonable requirements.
1 know that during the war years an attampt
was made to improve the qualify of our
bacon; but my contention is that the trouble
bias bean not with the qualify of the bacon
but with the process of curing it. It doas seem
f0, me that the law of common sense should
apply. True, af fer the meat strike occurred
some effort was made to have hogs accepfed
at other than the stipulated weight. It must
ha remembered also that acrose the border
from western Canada hogs are bringing 25
cents a pound live weight, and we have been
getting an average of 19 or 20 cents, dressed
weight. Thaf je the situation. Yet we are
short of bacon and fat. 1 believe the shortage
will continue until a sensible policy is adopted
and a man is paid for what he produces. I arn
disappoinfed at the blundering policy with
respect f0 farma producte.
From whaf I have beard since coming down
to Otfawa I would not be surprised if we bad a
general election so-on. I heard some olà etraw
being threshad by a man wbo could flot talk
about anyfhing aise under the ston. Certainly I
expecfed f0 bear something about Canada's
plans for assisfing other coontrias in the face
of an uncertain future; but the talk is about
the Tory part y; the othar issue je as dead
as wild pigeons, or the dodo.
Hon. Mr. HOWARD: Or the Tory party.
Hon. Mr. HORNER: 1 rernember tbat years
ago,' when catf le were eelling -at vary low prices,
Siîr Robert Borden made arrangements to
secora a mnarket for a certain nomber in tbe
United States; -and at a great Liberal rally
in the cify of Montreal, the complaint was
raised that hae was allowing our cattle to be
disposed of over tbe border when the price of
heef locally had gone Up to 10 or 15 cents a
pound. At that time the Liberal parfy was
working for the consumer. If muy be that the
purpose of this whola soheme is to punish tbe
West fo the tune of haîf a billion dollars
bacause we out there -are bad fellows, having
votad Social Credit or C.C.F.; but do yoL,
suppose thaf treatment of this kind is going
f0 indoce us to support the governmenf?
1 would emphasize as strongly as I can
the mi.ctake which bas'been made, -and woold
urge, evan at ;this laf e date, that we shoold, be
allowed to sell our cattle in the United States.

SENATE

One hears talk to the effeet that people, ail
of whom were formerly supporters of the government in power, have started a movement
for secession from the rest of Canada. Personaily I cannot, blame thcm; and if the treatment our producers are receiving is continued,
more ivili be beard of this proposai.
It only romains for me to register the
strongest protest 1 can against the way in
which the ceiling on the price of oats and
barley was removod. Had this been done
before harvest it might have been less
objectionable. But wvhat bappened was that,
while one farmer secured a carload or twe of
feed at 52 cents a buishel, bis neighibour,
expecting that lie would have time to buy
feed for his hiogs at approximateiy the samne
price, suddonly found the cost of feed
increased by 40 cents a bushel. As a resuit
of tihis action of the governiment, there is
,any'thing but harimeny in western Canada. I
do net know wvhether it is intended, to bold
an eloction ie the early future, but perhaps
an clection would clear the air.
In concluýien, miay I say that I do flot want
an'More fun poked at me regarding my views
on the tariff: 1 have ncx'er beiieved in a tariff

of this country. I, tee, recail the election of

H-on. G. P. BURCHILL: Honourable senators, it was net mvN intcntion te make any

and I arn goiog te ask the indulgence of the
liue wvbile I niake a few observ ations regardtng condition- a.4 thecy arc te the Maritimes.
If tItis chamber is te make an intelligent
appraisal cf the nation's weii-Jbeing generaliy
across the country, there must be made available te it information frein ail the many sectiens of this country's varied eeenomy. My
own imprcssion i.s that it is net the producer
or the bus.inessI.man who is sufferiog todav,
but the salaried man, who is being squeezed

at the moment by greatiy increased costs of
living. With the exception of that greup, a
stirvey would shbow conditions generaliy sound

After the eveats of the past six years, witli
the dislocation cf normal trad:e channels and
the happenings ie ether counitries of the world
cf -,wbich we read in our daily newspapers, I
submit that it, is a matter for bappy congratulations, pi-ide, and, thankfulness as Canadians,
tît this country is s0 buoyant and that living
conditions are as satisfactery as thev are. I
arn net minimizing the probiems that exist.
or pretcndiag that ne mistakes have been

transactions ivili net, agree that under the
uncortainty cf presont, world conditions it is
almost, impossible te make plans or decisions
regarding the future. On the contrary, the
prudent businessman protect.s Iiimself in, bis
commitments. if ho cao, against hazards which
ne one can foresco at the moment. Se it i'z
with the policies, of a goveromeot, wvhich arc
ailzo at the mercy cf government policies er
strategies in

which appear adequate today are ot sufficient te meet tomerroWs situation. A story is
told cf a gentleman who, in visiting a bospital,
e-ame across a patient whose head and bands
were handagcd. Struck by bis appearance, hie
sai(l, "Wliat bappened te yeu?" "Oh", s.tid the

The
visiter said. "Tricd te jump through a plateg-lass w'indow! 'Why did you de that?" "Well,"
,aid the patient, "I thought it wvas the best

thing te do, at the time." I con'iider. je the

and good common senee andI industry of t.he
Canadian people, I do think we must give
credit to the policies of government which
madIe our present happy position possible.
1 make that statement in view of the
effect of those policies on the industries
in my own province. New Brunswick's forests
are ber greatest asset, and the production and
manufacture of forest produets ber biggest
industry. This brings me to Canada's major
forest ýindustry, pulp and paper. Here is a
single industry whieh affects directly bhe livelihood of about half a -million Canadians, antI
indirectly, through transportation, power, fuel
and equipment, several hundred thousand
more. In an address by R. M. Fowler, President of the Canadian Pulp and Paper
Association, tIelivered in Montreal on October
20 last, it was pointed out that amuîîg Canadian industries pulp and paper stands first in
employment, first in total wages paid, first in
export values, first in net value of production,
and first in capital invested. The sum paid to
workers last year totalled $195 million, divided
equally between mill labour and workers in
the woods. There are 113 pulp and paper
milîs scattered across Canada, of which 35
are newsprint milîs. Ninety-four per cent of
Canadian newsprint is exported, while fine
paper, paperboard, wrapping paper, etc., is
largely used in the domestie market. In our
currency problems no industry has served
Canada better in balancing trade andi bringing
into the country American dollars. Canada's
total exports to the United States for the first
eight months of this year amounted to $645
million, of which pulp and paper exports
totalled $293 million, or 45à per cent,-so that
out of every commercial American dollar that
lias come into this country this year the pulp
and paper industry lias accounted for 45 cents.
Now, the point is that this great industry
neyer in its history lias been as prosperous as
it is at the present time. With an active
tIemand for its output, and full employment
from the stump to the finished produet, the
pulp and paper machines across Canada are
running at full capaeity .As further proof of its
healthy condition-and these figures are interesting as an indication of what private enterprise is capable of in the matter of labour
relations--a comparison of the wages paid in
1939 and in 1947 shows that while $90 was
the lowest wage paid to the mill worker in
1939, the lowest wage in 1947 was 87 cents per
hour, or $2.20 a ycar, which means that even
withi the increased cost of living, the worker
is much better off in 1947 -than hie was in 1939.
5853- 6

Hon. Mr. HORNER: Pardon me. That
includes wages paid; but a lot of the work is
done by contract.
Hon. Mr. BURCHILL: That is just in the
mîlîs. I am speaking of the mill-workers.
I want to pass on and say a word now about
lumber. From the earliest days the maritime
provinces of Nova Scotia andI New Brunswick
have been shipping lumber to the United
Kingdom. The business has long been a very
important part of our economy and lias been
one of the economie bonds which lias kept us
close to the Mother Country. During the war
years, with Scandinavian sources of supply
shut off, Britain turnýed more than ever to
Canada for hier su~pplies of wood. 1 will not
attempt to tIescribe how 'well the lumber
industry of Caiiada responded-both east and
west, management and labour-I am only
coneernied at the moment 'with present
developments. Under the s9pur of war conditions our lumber production in the Maritimes
had very materially increascd, and, last year
amounted to 800 million, superficial. feet. 0f
this quan'tity, 62 per cent iras excported, antI
the balance, 38 per cent, was used in the
domestie trade. After the end of hostilities,
in order to proteet the requirements of the
Ulnited Kingdom and preserve the pattern of
the natural movement of eastern Canadian
lumber, the government allowed a free quota
to Great. Britain of 290 million superficial
feet, after which the producer was obliged to
seIl two cars to the domestie trade in order
to secure an export permit for one car. Prices
were arranged in bulle with the British Timber
Control on our behaîf by the Maritime Lumber Bureau, a voluntary organization whîch
lias done invaluable work all through the war
for the eastern lumber industry. The United
Kingdom prices arranged were sufficiently
above the ýCanadian ceiling to permit operators to produce, but far below world prices of
spruce and comparable woods. A comparison
of the cost to the 'United Kingdom of all lier
wood purchases during 1946 is interesting,
because it shows that the lumber shipped
from. eastern Canada -was, by a wide margin,
the cheapest wood purchased from any country in the world. The figures show the cost

SENATE

lion. ýIr. ROI{BVCI:
Whv did eastern
Canada nýot get a better price than that?
Hion. Mr. BURCHILL: Thc-c prices were
arranged with the British Timber Control by
our Maritime Lumber Burcau with a vicw to
giving the producer a fair margin of profit.
There lias always been a kindly feeling in
Nova Scotia and New Brunswick tnwards the
United Kingdom, and se they did not seek
too, great a profit.
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: Mav I ask the hionourable senator what year these figures are
for?
Hon. Mr. BURCHILL: 1947. 1 arn sorry
if I said 1946.
With the shortage of dollars in 1948, the
British Timber Control is njt at present a
buyer, se the Maritime lumberman for the
first time in history bas no immediate prospect of selling any softwood to the United
Kingdom next year. This means a greatly
reduccd eut, with the resiiltant unemployment.
The Canadian govcrnment have co-operated
by doing the only thing they could do to

lion. Mr. DAVIES: Where is Great Britain
getting its softwood froin, if if is flot receîving if fron ýCanadian markets?
Hlon.
Mr. BURCHILL:
From
British
Columbia. 1 arn just coming to, that.
As it sfandrý at pre'sent. the onlv contact
whîich eastern Canada has been able to retain
withi the United Kingdom market for 1948,
beyond a small quantity of hardwood, is the
renewal of a supply of 150,000 cords of pitprops, which are nccessarv for the coal rnnng
indusfry.
Our British Coluimbia friends, whose industry is flot se seasonal as ours in the east, are
in a happier position, for they made a sales
arrangement with Brifaini which will carry
themn until Jonc 1, 1948.
While we have
always admired the keen business abilitv and
progressive character of or friends in British
Columbia. inclîding these in the lumber industry-many of whem got their background and
some of týheir training in the Maritimes-I
want te pay special tribote te thoir achievement in rnaking a sales contract with the
British government on terrns which, in addition te selling the stock in British Columbia,
îicludes an extra item of a.pproximately
thirty precious Canadian dollars per thousand

te rail a lot of it across the continent te
ports on the Atlantic seaboard. I take off rny
lit te the British Columbia lumbermen.
Hon. Mr. QUINN: Is that British Columbia
lumber being sold at the samne price as the
eaisfern Canadian lumber?
Hon. Mr. BIJRCIIILL: No. They have
their scheduled price eut there, wvhich is higlier
than, ours.
Maritime lumbermen have enjoyed the
finest co-operation from the governmenf ahl
througli the difficulties and problcms of the
past few .ucars, and are hopeful that the present
situation is but temporary and that before
long currency arrangements will be worked eut
which will permit the resuimption cf trading
through normal channels.
Before I sit down I wanf te support my case
by adding a word cf evidence from a public
litility.
Hon. M'r. HIAIG: But first, could you tell
uis somtlhing about the apple crop cf tîte
Maritimc Provinces?
Hon. Mr. BURCHILL: 1 arn sorr'v that I
have ne information about the apple business.
M 'v honotîrablo friend fromn Kings' (Hon. Mr.
McIDonaild) is an authority on apples, and hoe
wîll complefe the story.
As I say, I want te add a word of evidencc
from a public~ utilitv. Tlîe teleplione buiness
is rcgarded as a fair index cf current conditions.
The records show that in the province of New
Brunswick, as in many other provinces, the
ileman<l for telephione service bas reached an
al] -fime higlh. At the beginning cf this year
th-ere were appîoximatcly 5,000 people in New
Brunswick
waiting
'for
telephones,
and
althoug-h 4.563 installations were made up te
the end cf November there still is a lisf of
deferrcd applicants numbcring between 4.000
and 5,000. I believe this is the expcrience cf
telephione cempanies operating in other sectiens cf Canada.
Lot my honourable fricnd from the West got
wvhatever comforf hoecan for his party eut cf
some femporary difficulties in western agricultutre; I arn afraid thore is small hope for bis
party in the Maritimes. 1 arn sure my hioncurable friend from L'Acadio (Hon. Mr. Léger)
who lives in the thriving, expanding and prosperous city of Moncton, will bear me eut when
I say that conditions there are very satisfactory. And if any further evidence were nýeeded,
the resoîts of recent by-elecf ions in the provinces of Nova Scofia and New Brunswick,
along with those of the recent provincial elctien in Prince Edw,ýard Island, would indicate
that flic policies of the present government are

PRIVATE BILL
FIRST READING

Hon. G. P. CAMPBELL presented Bill C,
an Act respecting the Bell Telephone Company of Canada.
The bill was read the first time.
THE PRIME MINISTER
BIRTHDAY

FELICITATIONS

Hon. WISHART McL. ROBERTSON:
Honourable senators, it is a dangerous practice,
perhaps, to refer to birthdays, because it might
result in unfairness to some who are omitted.
However, with the consent of the Senate, I
should like at this time to refer to the seventythird birthday of the Prime Minister of
Canada.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: There are several
reasons why I do so. The first is that the
seventy-third birthday of the Prime Minister,
although maybe little different from his
seventy-second or his seventy-fourth. except for
the year in which it falls, is notable because of
the fact that at the age of seventy-three a
prime minister would not ordinarily be
expected to be continuing in office. The second
reason is that parliament is in session on this
occasion, and the third is that the Prime
Minister lias just recently returned from the
Old Country where, at the hands of His
Majesty the King, he was made the recipient
of the Order of Merit, a gift which carries with
it a very high honour and one that very few
hold. As a matter of fact, I think this is the
first occasion on which such an honour has been
bestowed on a Canadian. It is the confluence
of these reasons that prompts me to refer at
this time to the seventy-third birthday of the
Prime Minister, and to extend to him on behalf
of all members of the Senate-as I believe I
am safe in doing, although I have no authority
to do so-congratulations on having attained
another birthday, express our satisfaction that
he retains his good health and spirits, and offer
our best wishes for his future well-being.
Hon. JOHN T. HAIG: Honourable senators, I should like to join with the leader of
the government here in congratulating the

Prime Minister on having achieved his
seventy-third birthday, and in extending to
him our wishes for his good health in the
years ahead. Some of us in this section of the
house may not agree with all the policies and
actions of the Prime Minister, but we all
know that he has given earnest attention to
the welfare of the people of Canada during
his administration. Whether he will continue in office for another birthday or not, I
do not know. J do know, however, that
parliament is very seldom in session on the
17th day of December; in fact, so far as I
can find from the records, this is the second
time that it has happened since confederation.
In wishing the Prime Minister good luck, long
life an: happiness on this occasion, I may say
that I feel a very kind personal regard for
him. I will confess to the house that when I
saw in a recent issue of Maclean's magazine
a coloured reproduction of a photograph of
the Prime Minister by Karsh, I said to myself,
"He looks better than I thought he really
did." So I picked up my pen and dropped
him a note of three lines to that effect. He
replied, "I have the same opinion myself.
Yours truly." I enjoy these little incidents ini
public life; they are very interesting.
Honourable members, we on this side of the
house join with all other senators in wishing
the Prime Minister of Canada long life and
happiness.
SPEECH FROM
ADDRESS

THE

THRONE

IN REPLY

The Senate resumed from yesterday the
consideration of His Excellency the Governor
General's speech at the opening of the session
and the motion of Hon. Mr. Ferland for an
address in reply thereto.
Hon. ARTHUR W. ROEBUCK: Honourable senators, first let me join in the delightful and time-established custom of extending
felicitations to the mover (Hon. Mr. Ferland)
and seconder (Hon. Mr. Gershaw) of the
address in reply.
The leader of the opposition in this
chaýmber (Hon. Mr. Haig) recently remarked
-inadvertently,
I think-that he did not
know why we had been called, together at this
time. Well, it seems clear enough to me. The
government lbas encountered a situation of
very serious import to our country. It has
taken the responsibility of extraordinary
action designed to meet the emergency, and
it bas called parliament together in accordance with the best principles of democratic
procedure-first that parliament may approve
or disapprove its actions, and second, that

so long as it worked, but since the war, unfortunately, it has not worked, and for two good
reasons. First, Great Britain and the continental European countries have not had
favourable balances to the extent that they
had them in the ante-bellum years with which
to purchase the products of Canadian farms
and factories. In the second place, to the
extent of an outright gift of one billion dollars
to Great Britain, and mutual aid credits of
$3,175 million extended to the entire sterling
area, we have made it unnecessary for these
countries to pay us at all for the produce
which we have sent to them across the seas.
Under other circumstances we would' have
been paid' in currency; but we have been
redeeming these credits by the shipment
abroad of the products of Canada's farms
and factories.
I am not now discussing the wisdom or even
the necessity of these extensions of credit
and these gifts. That is another matter. I
am simply asking if there is anything extraordinary in a decrease of $1 billion in our
national bank account, coincident with gifts
and credits of $4 billion? What an extraordinary thing it wouldi be if, having given away
$4 billion, we were able to maintain the
same bank account we had before we did so.
No one in his private affairs would expect
such an accomplishment in any one year.
There are other important ways whereby
we ourselves have contributed to our adverse
tirade position. I have alread-y mentioned the
sale of grain to the United States, during the
years 1943, 1944 and 1945, to a total of $550
million. Since then Canada has made of the
wheat business a national monopoly, and we
have sold the Canadian exportable crop to
Great Britain at considerably less than world
prices. What the loss in millions may total
I do not know. Once again, I am not discussing the merit of the transaction; I am
simply calling attention to the financial facts.
I d'o not know, and I am not going to attempt
to estimate, the intangible gains which have
accrued to us as the result of those transactions. I would say, however, that the intangible gains are there, and that they are
obvious and very considerable. I merely
point out that as yet there is no balancing
item in our financial accounts to offset the
difference between what we have received and
what we might have had. In passing, I should
like to make the observation that it is seldom that anyone can buy at market and sell

at less than market without depleting his
reserves. You would search a long time for
an illustration of anyone ever having done so.
Once again, in order to protect the Canadian consumer, we have prohibited the sale
of Canadian cattlie and beef in the United
States market. The purpose of the prohibition
is admirable, just as tihere are admirable
phases in the other subjects to whioh I have
referred. But why marvel at a shortage of
United States currency when you ban the
sale of Canadian goods to United States consumers who would have paid for them in
United States dollars?
We have also made gold a government
monopoly, and have fixed its price to the
producer. I need hardly make the comment
that gold mining is one of Canada's important industries, and that in the past the sale
of gold has been a major factor in maintaining our favourable balances of trade. But
of recent years, due to the narrowing margin
between the cost of production and the fixed
price, gold production has declined seriously.
Mining men have told me that all they
require is an open market in which they can
sell the product of Canadian mines to the
highest bidder. If the government would
simply get out of the way, so I have been
told, gold mining would again flourish as it
did in the past, to the maintenance of Canada's
world position.
I have mentioned a number of factors
which, I submit, have contributed to our
adverse trade position, aIl of them being the
direct result of governmental interference in
what previously had been considered in this
chamber and everywhere else as private, competitive business.
I have yet to mention perhaps the greatest
factor of all-our government monopoly of
United States exchange. Up to the end of
1945 Canada was engaged in the then allimportant business of war, which was justification for almost anything. It is the continuance of the Foreign Exchange Control
Board's interference in times of peace which
I now propose to discuss. Honourable senators will recollect that, so far as my voice
would carry in this chamber, I opposed the
passing of the Foreign Exchange Control Act
in the summer of 1946. I opposed it as a
matter of principle, outright and in toto, in
all its phases, including its autocratic authority
to (1) monopolize United States funds, (2)
dole out United States purchasing power to
Canadian businessmen in accordance with its
own sweet will and favour, or that of the
bankers, who are its agents, and (3) declare
the rate of exchange.

SENATE

Let us cast our minds back to the days
before we were concerned with institutions
of this kind. In the days before we made
American funds in Canada a government
monopoly, Canadian residents bought and sold
United States currency at market rates, in the
same way that theyi bought and sold all other
commodities and securities. When we bought
more goods abroad than we sold in world
trading. the rate -of exchange went against us,
which is another way of saying that our dollar
fell in value as compared with the United
States dollar or sterling. This meant that
the purchasing power of the Canadiran dollar
was greater at home than abroad. In old
times when the rate of exchange went against
us the purchasing power of the Canadian
dollar at home was greater, to the extent of
the exchange, than it was abroad. What effect
did that have? Why, the Canadian resident
who desired some commodity discovered that
he could buy it more cheaply at home than
he could abroad, and accordingly he exercised
his ingenuity to make use of the home product.
Otherwise he would do without.
Thus an
automatic balance was always working: the
principles of trade, the rules of mathematicsmere additions and subtractions,-,the natural
order, if I may call it that, supplied the
corrective, and the international balance was
maintained with the smoothness and universality of the force of gravity applied to a
weigh-scale.
WVe were then depending on ordinary rules
of nature; but this is not so under the rule of
the Foreign Exciange Control Board. Such
principles have been set aside. Businessmen
no longer employ their bankers as agents to
secure for them United States funds at the best
rates obtainable, as they did in bygone days.
Now the businessman who desires United
States funds with which to purchase United
States commoditices secs his banker, not as bis
own agent in the purchase of United States
funds on his account, but rather in the new
capacity of a civil servint-to quote the
Act, the "authorized agent" of the Foreign
Exchange Control Board-and the rate of
exchange no longer concerns the businessman
at all, for it is now fixed by governmental
decree issued either by the Minister of Finance
or by the board itself, and altereth not. The
relative value of Canadian and United States
money interests him but mildly, for if there are
exchange losses on the transaction the government pays them.
And observe that the
government, while it may pretend to set the
rate of exchange, does so only as between the
Canadian resident and the board, for the
government bas no power to require American
citizens to sell Un.ited States dollars for less

than they are worth. The setting of the rate
of exchange is limited to the transaction between the board and the Canadian citizen.
In discussions between bank manager and eustomer, talk about rates of exchange and the
soundness of the proposed transaction is a
thing of the past. The customer now tells the
bank manager how much he would like the
money-an attitude which is not to be marvelled at in periods when American money is
worth more than Canadian-what a fine fellow
he is, and what a fine fellow the banker is.
The customer points out that his account was
always in this bank and makes other covert
references to the "teacher's red apple." The
banker simply asks what amount is required,
and he sells American money out of government reserves, at dollar for dollar, without the
least concern as to the true value of the
currencies being exchanged.
Under this cock-eyed arrangement the government bas watched the board's huge stockpile of United States dollars melting away like
snow upon the desert's dusty face. As our
adverse trade balance grew, the difference
between the true value of the currencies increased, and with each increase in the actual
value of American money over Canadian
money, the demand for American in exchange
for Canadian at par has of course also increased. Why wouldn't it? So the Department of Finance finally wakes up to find itself
vis-a-vis with losses that are appalling.
J submit to vou that the major portion of
our difficulty is of our own making, because
of three things. First, because of our gifts
and credits to our customers abroad. I am
not criticizing them; I have been at pains
te say that I am not discussing that feature
of these matters, actions in which opposition
and government joined. The government
would have bcen much criticized had it net
made those gifts and credits. There they
stand;
(and you are to think clearlv you
if
nust not aeave out factors becau-e of incidental thoughts.
The second factor in the making of our
difficulty is governmental interference in the
marketing 'of wheat, gold, livestock and perhaps some other 'things. And the third is,
governmental interference with the automatic adjustment consequent on variations in
the rate of exchange, the balance-wheel of
business.
In the face of these facts, which I submit
to you are obvious, the Conservative party
is shouting for a controlled devaluation of
the Canadian dollar by ten per cent. But
this quite plainly would get us nowhere, for
the balance-wheel would still be tied. We
would still bave a fixed and static rate rather

DECEMBER 17, 1947
than one varying from time to time, sometimes in our favour, when circumstances
warranted, and sometimes against us, when
it should be.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: May I ask the honourable
senator a question?
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: Yes.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: What was the drop in
United States ceurrency 'held by Canada
between January 1 and July 1, 1946?
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: I have noît that
figure.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I suggest th-at it was very
simaîl when the 10 per cent exchange was ini
effect.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: The 10 per cent
exehange had some effect, of course, but I
think the Minister of Finance is right in saying that it would flot apply a sufficient corrective at the present time. As to whether it
would or not, your guess is as good as mine.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: It did in the perîod I
mentioned.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: But that period bas
passed, and we are now in a different one.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: No.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: I ar n ot able to
give the bunourable gentleman the figure for
which hie asks. He probably has it, and may
reply to what I have said.
I was referring to the approach of the Conservative party to this matter. I submit it is
as unrealistie as some of the things that the
government has done.
The C.C.F. of course just loves this control.
It wants stili more controls-Il suppose on the
old principle of cure by the hair of the dog
that bit you.
The government bas chosen an entirely
different course, and that is what we are here
to consider. It bas chosen the expedient of
bullying trade, in the hope of coercing it into
a favourable balance and thus raising again
the true value of the Canadian dollar, and so
escaping the exchange losses. By a sweeping
enactmnent of prohibitions and limitations of
imports, and the imposition of excise taxes,
we have built a wall across the southeru
boundary of this country and have fenced ourselves off from our most essential customer.
There is good reason to expect that the policy
will succeed in restoring a favourable balance
of Canadian trade with the United States, but
the question is whether the cure is flot worse
than the disease.

Let us not umderestîmate the destructive
effects of what we are doing. How deadly are
these restrictions I do flot know, but 1 do
know that such strangulation of the national
economy is exceedmngly serious. Land values
in Canada have been mounting and the coinbined tax burden of all our goverfiments is
grievously heavy. The question is whether
industry can continue to carry tbe load when
manacled with sucb prohibitions and restrictions. I leave the question, because only the
future can give us the answer. But let us not
close our minds to the dangers which lie in
excessive burdens placed upon business, to the
point where profits disappear and stagnation
results.
The problemn is, what to do in the face of
the picture I have endeavoured to paint. 1
sympathize with those in autbority, who are
called upon to deal with such problems. I
give credit to themn for t-heir attitude, but that
dioes not relieve my 'honourable friends or myself of the responsibility of using our own
minds, and perhaps helping to mould our
future Dolicy.
It is obvious that in the matter of a national
policy we are at a turning of the ways. We
must either retrace our steps in the matter of
government interference or else go on to a
completely controlled economy. There is no
half-way house of refuge. We cannot remain
haîf bond and haîf free; one control always
makes necessary another.
Honourable senators will remember how, in
the face of a situation brought about, I submit,
by controls, we establisbed further controls
prohibiting the importation of many articles
and limiting the importation of others, and
hiow there immediately followed the necessity
of re-establishing price control. Now one
finds many in our community demanding further interference with the liberty of the sub.iect and with the exercise of bis civil rights.
The question is what to do about it? I shaîl
make suggestions; not with authority, but
worth while as suggestions.
First, I would remove these unwelcome
prohibitions, limitations and excise impositions,
as rapidly as possible. I do not attempt to
define how rapidly that may be; only those
who are doing the job can judge of that.
I say to the people of Canada and to the
government: Get out of these restrictions as
rapidly as possible.
Second, I would take the government out
of all competitive businesses with the greatest
possible despatch.
Third, I would abolish the Foreign Exchange
Control Board, root and branch, and leave

AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS ACT
POSTPONEMENT OF MOTION FOR
CONTINUATION UNTIL
MARCH 31, 1948

On the notice of motion by Hon. Mr.
Robertson:
That, whereas section eleven of the Agricultural Products Act, being chapter ten of the
Statutes of 194.7, provides that subject as thereinafter provided, that act shall expire on the
thirty-first day of December, one thousand nine
hundred and forty-seven, if parliament meets
during November or December, one thousand
nine hundred and forty-seven, but if parliament
does not so meet it shall expire on the sixtieth
day after parliament first meets during the year
one thousand nine hundred and forty-eight or
on the thirty-first day of March, one thousand
nine hundred and forty-eight, whichever date
is the earlier: Provided that, if at any time
while that act is in force, addresses are presented to the Governor General by the Senate
and House of Commons respectively, praying
that that act should be continued in force for
a further period, not in any case exceeding one
year, from the time at which it would otherwise
expire and the Governor in Council so orders,
that act shall continue in force for that further
period.
And whereas it is considered desirable to continue the said act in force until the thirty-first
day of March, one thousand nine hundred and
f orty-eight;
The following address be presented .to His
Excellency the Governor General of Canada:
To His Excellency Field Marshal The Right
Honourable Viscount Alexander of Tunis, Knight
of the Most Noble Order of the Garter, Knight
Grand Cross of the Most Honourable Order of
the Bath, Knight Grand Cross of the Most Distinguished Order of Saint Michael and Saint
George, Companion of the Most Exalted Order
of the Star of India, Companion of the Distinguished Service Order, upon whom has been
conferred the Decoration of the Military Cross,

one of His Majesty's Aides-de-Camp General,
Governor General and Commander-in-Chief in

May it Please Your Excellency:
We, His Majesty's most dutiful and loyal subjects, the Senate of Canada, in parliament
assembled, respectfully approach Your Excellency praying that the Agricultural Products
Act be continued in force until the thirty-first
(lay of March, one thousand nine hundred and
forty-eight.
Honourable
Mr. ROBERTSON:
Hon.
senators, I am asking that the house allow
this motion, of which notice bas been on
our order paper for some days past, to stand
until tomorrow. The reason is that I do not
want to proceed with it until I am in a position to give the Senate all the information
that I can obtain as to the current negotiations for a trade agreement with the United
Kingdom on food products. A statement is
being made in another place today, and I may
make a supplementary statement here at the
opening of tomorrow's sitting, before we
reach the deadline within which the motion
for continuation of the Agricultural Products
Act must be dealt with. Honourable members
know that that deadline is the last day that
parliament is in session before the Christmas
recess. I have been notified by some senators
that they wish to speak on the motion, but
would prefer to wait until they have the
information whicli I hope to be able to
present tomorrow. I therefore ask that the
notice of motion stand until tomorrow.
The notice of motion stands.
THE CHRISTMAS RECESS
On the Orders of the Day:
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Honourable senators, for the benefit of those who may not be
here tomorrow, I wish to announce that unless
unforeseen circumstances arise it is the intention to move, when the House of Commons
adjourns this week, that it stand adjourned
until Monday, January 26, 1948. I shall move
tomorrow that when the Senate adjourns it
stand adjourned until Tuesday, January 27,
1948, at 8 o'clock in the evening. I am proposing that we resume a day later than the
other house because I recall that in the past
some honourable members, I think perhaps
those from Prince Edward Island, have found
it very inconvenient to get from their homes
to Ottawa on a Monday.

Hon. EUGÈNE
PAQUET: Honourable
senators. in carrying out hier program for
the economic recovery of the country, Canada
lias show n to the worid that wc are a nation
which nmust be reckoned with in future. Our
war effort, on a voluntary basis from the ver '
firit days of the confliet, made it possible foi'
a great demiocratie country like Great Britain.
to live throui the dark days wvhich marked
the opening of hosti1ities. Soverai countries
were then rüeling undor the blows of the
emcmv andi the whcie w'orid had turned
towards Canada, whichi, at gallant Aibion's
side, wvas their main hiope of survival. Throughont the gigantic struggie we remaineti united
andi rîrong; our Royal Canadian Navy and
oui- merchant marine were the first te take
tn active paît in the battie. I take this opporiiunity of paying tribute to those courageous
-camen w-ho have bocome the heroes, of
the flrst round in the battie of the Atlantic.
They did not hesitate to board their ships,
-whichi inevitabiy were only haif e-quipped
foir action. ie order to dueliver supplies to the
]ast, strongliold of democracy and civilizaition. Their valour was, above reproach and
thecir contribution to final victorv cannot bo
a-.soSsed.
Honourabie sonators. at the bpginning of
tItis new era of poace, it is our duty to offer
otîi tlîankful prayers to those brav e sons of
Canada, who made the stîpromo sacrifice foir
thoir countr v.
It is the custom in ail couintries of tîte worid
te raise inemorials, in mcmory of tlîose whli
gave tîteir lives on the battlefieids. For that
pur-pose. svnîhols are cut into sýtone to rc mintl
future generations of the ideals and the valotir
of thoso w-ho are no longer witlh us.
I congratulate the government on its efforts towards
cnmmemorating those w'ho have died. Sncb
comrnmorat ion w iii show to the woîlu the,
everlasting gratitude of the nnMion te its departed sons.
I believe, hiowevcr. that the
grcatest monument that can be -ai.ed in
memorv of oui' brave soidiers is te put je
tangible form the ideal for which theY have
died. 'Neyer could we hope te, build a more
fitting and eneLuring memorial.
Henonrable senators, if our sons hav e fought
witiî sncbi courage and made sucli sacrifices,
it was to ensure a lasting peace not only
hetween the varions nations of the world but
aise botwoen 'the varions sections of eachi
nation. How can our country contribute te
that iasting peace? In the field of international relations it is our dnty to help promote understanding and co-operation among

freedomi-loving nations which are the piliars
cf our domnoci-atie (ivilization. Our sons have
fought in eider te give back te the world its
lost fi-eedom. and it is only logical that we
should help te guard it.
May I quote a few words spoken on June
18. 1936 by the ilonourable
r.Dandurand?
They convey my wishes, my feelings and
my hope in regarud te the yonng people of
our countr-y. The life cf the varions nations

I say to yeung Fr-ench Canadians that tlîcy
inav, with the help of higher education, a more
highly cuitured mmid, prepare thenîselves te play
an important part in Canadian Confeuleration.
They will thus nomiber ainong the elite which

Let them get te work inmnediateiy. The o1doîgeneratien did net have the same opportunitios

DECEMBER 18, 1947

Industrial help bas greatly cantributed ta
agricultural progress in the last decades. As
a resuit of scientiflo research, it is now passible for aur farmers ta improve their lot
through the use of practical methods the
efficiency of which is more and mare rccognized. Machines are making up for the shortage of farm labour and are also increasing
yields, while fertilizers are a valuable supplement to farm manure in providing the
soil with regenerative elements formerly unknown and lielping to maintain and increase its
fcrtility.
From this standpoint agriculture
owes much ta industry for its huge devclapment and the many ressources which can now
be taken advantage of for the benefit of
mankind.
There are at the present time many industrial
ventures which, in most agricultural pursuits.
hielp farmers ta develop their lands.
The soil is still the greatcst factor in aur
economie recovery.
Our first duty is ta look after aur fellowcitizens and ta help them in flnding the means
of leading a normal life. Such matters as
international security, contraIs of ail kinds,
immigration, national defence. elections, labour
relations, agricultural problems, housing shortage, tex agreements with the provinces,
offer ample material for enimated discussions
during the present session. There are also
matters which the variaus parties mey raise,
as well as meesures which the government
may introduce. and of which they have flot
as yet breathed a word.
If parliament intendi; ta wade thraugh ail
the legisîstive measures forest in the Speech
fromn the Tbrone, it will have ta discipline
itself. The discussions should be condtucted
in an orderly and methodicel manner. Otherwise, the members of the other place who are
arriving in Ottawa must be prepared for a
lengthy stay.
The sad words which Cardinal Villeneuve
uittered two or three deys before. bis deeth
are familiar to everyone: "It seems that
it is God's will that I should die aIl alone,
far away from my country and fram my
friends."' From the very day of bis appointment as a cardinal, hie frequently must have
experienced a feeling of loneliness. But from
the moment lie felt certain of bis impending
(leath. in a foreign country, hundreds of miles
from bis episcopal see, this feeling became a
reel suffering. the reward and the crawning
piece of a great life!
A man of untiring devotian, a methodical
worker, Cardinal Villeneuve could be found
wherever there was good work ta do, a gaod
cause ta champion, a new venture ta pramote.

As the Osservatare Romano sa ably expressed
it, his death "is a source of great sorrow for
the Church, the Holy Sec, the College of
Cardinals, the archdiocese of Quebec, the
Congregation of the Oblates, and the whole
Canadian nation." It is with bowed head
that every Canadian pays tribute to his
memory.
When aur forefathers settled here, they were
determined ta take possession of the land, ta
become its masters and ta, make use of it so
that families could grow and prosper.
The northward trend of industrial development doomed this mode of life. At the beginning of the century no ane wanted ta settie
on the land. Our rural families were migrating
ta the towns. Montreal saw its population
increase fivefold in haif a century. A complete upheaval was taking place. Seventy-five
per cent of our population, which was prodaminantly rural in 1871, were living in cities.
In the meantime people from central
Europe-Germans. Czcchs, Ukrainians-taak
possession of aur western plains, which now
form the provinces of Saskatchewan and
Alberta. True, the valiant pianeers of Ontario
strengthened their position. But in the minds
of aur people and of their leaders generally,
industry and agriculture were aur chief pursuits.
I da not suggest that a dlean sweep should
be made of long-established methods and that
new systemns be built on their ruins. We must
keep thase attainments which meet aur social
and economic needs.
It is essential for ail those wha are concerned with ecanomia and social problems; ta
cambine their mental efforts in order ta ascertain what passibilities of settlement the
country may offer. Indeed, those who have
at heart the well-being of the people are
required. in normal times, ta provide constantly for the creatian of new employment
in order ta meet the *needs af the population.
The clouds af uneasiness hovering over the
United Natians at the end of the summer of
1942 have disappeared, if not completely, at
least sufficiently ta reveal the dawn of victary.
As a former physician fram Bonaventure,
may I bring ta your attentian the Co-aperative
Association Congresses held in Gaspé. The
best people from the Gaspé district canvened
under the enlightened guidance of Ris Eminence 'Bishop F. X. Ross, of Gaspé. This
untiring advocate of social work wished ta
assure the ca-aperative members from Gaspé
of his support in their endeavours ta promote
the social, moral and material development of
the Gaspé district.

Hon.

McL.
ROBERTSON
rnoved:
That, whereas section eleven of the Agricultural Products Act, being chapter ten of the
Statutes of 1947, provides that subject as thereinafter provided, that act shall expire on the
thirty-:first day of December. one thousand nine
hundred and forty-seven, if parliamnent meets
during November or December, one thousand
fine hundred and forty-seven, but if parliarnent
does flot so meet it shall expire on the sixtieth
day after parliament first meets during the year
one thousand nine hundred and forty-eight or
on the thirty-first day of March, one thousand
fine hundred and forty-eight, whichever date
is the earlier: Provided that, if at any tîme
while that act is in force, addresses are presented to the Governor General by the Senate
and House of Cominons respectively, praying
that that act should be continued in force for
a further period, not in any case exceeding one
year from the timne at which it would otherwise
expire, and the Governor in Council so orders,
that act shal] continue in force for that further
period.
And whereas it is considered desirable to continue the said act in force until the thirty-first
day of Marcb, one thousand fine hundred and
forty-eight:
The following address be presented to Hîs
Excellency the Governor General of Canada:
To His Excellency Field Marshal The Right
Honourable Viscount Alexander of Tunis, Knight
of the Most Noble Order of the Garter, Knight
Grand Cross of the Most Honourable Order of
the Bath, Knight Grand Cross of the Most Distinguished Order of Saint Michael and Saint
George, Companion of the Most Exalted Order
of the Star of India, Companion of the Distinguished Service ýOrder, upon whomn has been
conferred tbe Decoration of the Military Cross,
one of His Majesty's Aides-de-Camp General,
Governor General and Commander-in-Chief if
aud over Canada.
May it P]ease Your Exceflency:
We, His Majesty's most dutiful and loyal subjects, the Senate of Canada, in parliamnent
assembled, respectfully approach Your Excellency praying that tbe Agricultural Products
Act be continued in force until the thirty-first
day of March, one tbousand nine hundred and
forty-eight.
He said: Honourable senators will recail
that yesterday I said thiat I had delayed proceeding witb this motion, which bas been
standing in my name on the order paper for

69

some time, until 1 was in a position to present
to, the Senate the maximum obtainable information.
As bonourable members know, a
statement was made yestcrday aftcrnoon in
the Huse of Commons by the Prime Minister
as to the agreement reached with the United
Kiagdom. I inquired whether any furtber
staternent was to be made on the matter ia
that bouse today, and I -arn informed that
there is mo such intention. Had a supplementary statement been made I should have
included it in my remarks on this motion.
This matter must be deait with this session,
and as we are to adjourn today until January
27,' there is notbing to be gained by delaying
it further.
This motion, honourable senators, bas to
do with the powers under wbich the so-called
British food contracts were imnplemented.
The purpose of it is to place this legisiation
in exactly the same position that it would
have been in had -parliament not met before
the end of the present calendar year.
Hýon. JOHN T. HAIG: Honourable members, I listened to -the statement made by the
Prime Minister in the other place on the
agreements wîth Great Britain. That statement, which. I have since rend with care, says
that certain agreements have been made with
Great Britain as to supplies of 'bacon, eggs,
cheese and some other commodities, and
that until March 31, 1948 Britain will be
allowed to draw on ber Canadian credit to the
extent of $45 million, but will have to pay
$1 million on ber own account. In the discussion of the statement of the Prime
Minister, in the other place the Minister of
Agriculture, like my honourable friend the
leader of the government, was unable to
make any statement as to the amount of
the contracts or the price.
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: Is my bonourable
friend sure tbat it is in order for him to
discuss the contents of the proposed agreement at this time?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I amn quite sure. The
resolution before us asks for an extension of
powers.
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: As I understand it,
the resolution is to provide for tbe continuance of the agreements already in force.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: It applies to the contracts. It bas been discussed in another place,
and has to do with the continuation of certain
powers ýbeyond December 31. To ithat extenf,
at least, I bave a right to discuss the matter.
After listening to the speech made in the
House of Gommons, it is my opinion that

SENATE

the i-sue invoived in the mat-ter is simply
this: Wr say that we do flot trust the farmers
of this country ta seli thieir produce, and that
the Gos ernement of Canada proposes te act
as salesmnan for the prirnary producers. To
anv Sîîeh proposal 1 take violent exception. 1
think the farmers of Canada are just as
capable as anv other people te market thieji
production, and that their rigbht of free-will
should net be curtailed.
To illustrate rny contention, I wish te read
et some lengthi from an editorial whichi apprared
in the Winnipeg Fie Press on Wednesday,
December 17. No newspaper in Canada has
fought more bitterly against geverement control of the farmers' production than the Free
Press, and none bias challengcd more persistentlv the wheat agreement and ail it implies.
In its iatest editoriai on this subject this
iiewspaprr confirms something I said about a
vear and a hiaif ago ie this chamber, namely
that the father of the Wheat Control Bill is
net the Minister of Agriculture-although he
lias te take responsibiiity for it-but Mr. J. H.
Wesson, President of the Saskatchewan Wheat
Pool. A rcading of the agreement makes it
î1 îite plain that Mr. Wesson's whiole abject
was te put the Winnipeg Grain Exchange eut
of business. H1e makes ne bones about. In
putt ing the proseet policy intoe rfeet the Whieat
Board, accordieg te thie geverement's own
statement, lest lest year $123 million. and this
yer, on the basis of current prices, wvill lose
another $200 million. 1 peint eut that these
figures are the governmeet's own estimates.
Todav. or et any rate on December 6, when 1
left WVinnipcg. one could not buy a bushel of
wheat from the Wheat Board at Winnipeg te
ship te China, or Australia, or France, or Italy,
et ess than $3.35 f.o.b. Fort William.
Now let us sce what the Free Press says.
Politicallv it usually supports the goverfiment
of the day, but it makes exceptions, and 1 de
not biame it for the stand it is now taking,
because there is ne argument whichi can justifv
losses hv the western farmers of over S30
million je twe vears, and the truth is that ne
justification lias ever been attempted.
Hon. A. L. BEAUBIEN: May 1 ask my
lionourabie friend a question?
The Hon, tise SPEAKER: 1 had occasion a
year or se ago te mile that it is net in the
interests of debate in this chamber that editeniais shouid be read brr and printrd in fuill
in Hansard. It is ailowabie for an honourabie
member te quote a section from an edîteriai as
part of his argument se that hie himseif wouid
in effeet be making the statement, but he
shouid net read editoriais inte Hansard. I

beieve my ruiing on that occasion svas right,
and I would cali it te the attention of the
honouxabir Leader of the Opposition.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Your Honour, I will certainly accept your ruiing.
Incidentaily it
relieves me of a good deal of werk. Ail I
sisali do is te read one brief section:
As stated err on a pies-ions occasion, the
most miisleading statement is tisis extract from
Mr. Wesson's speech is that the pool farmers
"did net want te scrap the British Wbeat
agreemenst je faveur of the oenrî market . . .
Mr. Wessoîs mnst knew that the alternative te
the -wheat agreemenst is net tise opens market.
It rais be a state monopoly, a compulsory, whbrat
board, seiling wheat at tise world prie. That
is the policy that has bren ils opematien je
Australia for seme years.
I shail not transgress tIse mules by rrading
thIe edîtoial at length. but 1 may state tîsat
tise gist of its argument is that you de net
nerd te re-estabiish the Winnipeg Grain
Exchange in order te avoid selling te the
wheat pool. Take away the compulsory pool:
tise alternative is an open market, where yen
can seli as yen like. Some say that we wouid
seli through the grain exehange. That is net
necrssarily se. People could seli te the rievator companirs througs their agents in our
towes and villag-es W/hec I was a boy tisere
wer elevators, owned by farmers je tise varions localities ail over Manitoba, whicls bouglit
the wheat and sold it again. What rvery
elevator company did svas this-my honourahie friend freim Thunder Bey (Hon. Mr.
Paterson) can correct me if I am wrongwlien a mac broîight a load of grain te, say,
Alexandrin, the elevator mac would grade it
No. 2 Northern, at one or two or six pounds
deekage for dirt, as the case may be. Tisat
grain-sav it is a thousand buislsels--wouid go
inte the elevator, and nfter the elevator mac
bought it outright hie would wirr immediatelv
te isis principals in Winnipeg that hre had
bougit a thousand bushels of No. 2 Nortlsern
at Alexandria. The next morning the elevator
company wouid seli tise No. 2 Northern at the
market prie. It could net be rue in any
other way. In 1939 tise wheat pools did try
te rue it differentiy, and the resuit svas that
the wheat poois iost in Manitoba ncariy $3
million, je Saskatchewan nearly $8 million,
and in Alberta $6 million, and the gevernments ef those provinces came forward and
guarantred the ioss. I know that is what the
Government of Manitoba did.
The same situation applirs with respect te
bacon.
W/bat
right bas tise Dominion
Gevernment ta take bacon awav from the
producers at a certain prie and seli it on the
Britishs market at another prie? The London

DECEMBER 19, 1947

Times praisas Canada's genarosity in sailing
thase goods to Britain at this price. But why
shou]d ail the people of Canada be given
cradit for it? The farmers and the producers
are the ones who take the loss, and thay
should recaive the credit. It is the farmers
who bave lost $300 million in the two years.
What are the United States doing about thair
situation? Thay went into the market and
bought grain, and sold it at whatevar price
they liked. I gathar from the statements
made yesterday that the price of bacon is
going to be astimated, and it is not going to
be a fixad price but a temporary contract.
An Hon. SENATOR: Three months.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Yes, and there is no
stated amount. If my reports are correctand fa.rmer membars of this bouse can put
me right if I am wrong-Canadian farmers
ara not going to produce as many hogs next
yaar as they did this year. There is no question about that. Thay are afraid of this legislation; they cannot understand it. With
barley salling at $1.45 thay could not feed
their hogs and sali their bacon at the prevailing price. Ail these -factors enter into this
argument. I do not undaerstand why a Liberal
party would even enter into what is the most
hide-bouind Tory polic3é that an-y man could
imagine. I do not understand it at ail. It is
as though we were saying to the people of
Canada, "We know better what you should
get for your goods than you do yourselvas."
Hon. Mr. MaeLENNAN: Wbat was their
reason for doing tihat 1 wondar? Was it to
help Great Britain? That is one question that
I should. lika to ask my honourable friend.
And a second question is: What would be the
result if Great Britain could not buy the
wheat?
Hon. Mr. HA':Well, Britain .paid 1.55
this year for the wheat when the price sha
should have paid was 83.35.
Hon. Mr. MacLENNAN: Could she?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I will come to that. Just
wait a 'minute and do not go too fast. We,'
the Canadian people, should bave bought the
wheat from the farmers at 83.35 and sold it
to Britain at $1.,55. Ail of us should have paid
our share. We are taking the cradit for seîling wheat to Great Britain at $1.55, and we
have no right to do so. The people who
should, recaive the credit are those who raised
the wheat.
Hon. Mr. MacLENNAN: You did not
make any objection a few years ago when
the farmers in the West were making millions
upon, millions of dollars.

71

Hon. Mr. HAIG: No, but we gave some of
the money to every other part of Canada.
Hon. Mr. MacLENNAN: No, it was going
to the West.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Just last year we bonused
the fish of the Maritime Provinces, guaranteeing a certain price for the fisb. But let us
see what Britain could not buy. My honourable friend (Hon. Mr. MacLennan) says
Britain could not buy the wheat at a higher
price.
Hon. Mr. MacLENNAN: No.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: What happened in the
wheat world yesterday? Britain paid 82.72
to Australia for 80 million bushels of wheat.
Hon. Mr. -CAMPBELL: In pounda sterling,
was it not?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: That makes no difference.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON. Yes, it does.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: And let me point out something that is far more important. Australian
No. 1 wheat is nlot as valuable as Canadian
No. 1. As authority for this statement 1 refer
to the fact that on the Liverpool market in
1938 Australian No. 1 wheat in six-bushel lots
sold at 34 shillings, and Canadian No. 1 sold
at 51 shillings, or a difference of about 56 cents
per hushel in faveur of the Canadian wheat.
Hon. A. L. BEAIIBIEN: Australia only sold
80 million bushels, whereas we sold 160 million.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: W'ell, 80 million bushels is
aIl that Australia had to seli, and in an-y event
it is a lot of wheat. On the basis of those 1938
figures, if our wheat is only worth $1.55, the
Australian wheat is worth only $1.00. But
instead of Britain paying less for the Australian
wheat it paid $1.17 a bushel more, and when
you take into consideration the difference
between the qualities of the wheat you can see
that Australia is really getting nearly $1.80
more par bushal than we are.
Than let me point out that the governmant
did not take the control off ail oats and barlay,
but only off what is sold in Canada. I should
like the honourable gentleman froma Thunder
Bay (Hon. Mr. Paterson) to tell me what oats
and barlay are sellig for in the United States
today. I believe he wîll admit that the prices
are nearly double those in Canada. And tha
most startling feature is that the control was
taken off, not on the lst of August, but on
the 22nd of Octobar, after the farmars had
sold 80 per cent of what they had te sel1 , and
wben the grain was at Fort William or in

SENATE

c-lex-ators tlîrouglbout wes-tern Canada.
In
other words, it wvas owned by other people than
the farmers at that timo.
Hon. A. L. BEAIJBIEN: Only 45 per cent
of the coarsýe grains hiad been sold thon.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: But the rest was hoeld by
farmoers themselves and it wvas not for
sale. My bonourable frjcnd knows vcry wecll
that rvýerv farmner keeps a certain part of bis
coarse grains for his own u_ýe.

the

lion. A. L BEAUBJEN': I undlerstood the
staterncnt to ho that 80 per cent of the coarse
grains had been sold by that time.
Hon. Mr. H-AIG: I said, 80 per cent of the
qunivthat the farmers had for sale.
We are asked to approve the continuation of
the Agricultural Products Act for anothor
four months. If parliament. had not, been conveneel before the end of the year the act would
aiitomatically have continuied in force for sixty
days after the session openod in the New
Year, or until the 31st of March, 1948,' whichever (date happened to ho the enrlier; but as
tbiings are the act will expire on the 31ht of
Decomber unlcss the motion now before us is
pasýcd. WTo did not necd to ho called here
non- at aIl, an'd for the life of me I cannot
understand wly wvc were called. The goveromient lias gi\ven a mnighty fine OPPOrt unity to
the three opposition parties in the other biouse
tii talk anci talk and talk.
Hou. Mr. ROI3ERTSON-ý: Is that not thieir
righit
Hon. Mr-. HAIG: Yes, but the gox-erniment
did not expert to liave ail tbat talk at this
timie. It wouid bave donc botter by w-aiting
for furtber developmnents, until it was known
wlîat effort the Marsball plan would have on
conditions in Europe, and what advantage if
an 'v Canada w-as to deriv-e from that plan. I
repo,',
that I cannot understand why tho
se-ýsion wvas opcned at tbis time.
As invmber of this housc and a reprc-.entative of western Canada, I protest against governiment control of tbe farmn products of this
country.
Hon. A. L. BEAUI3IE-N: Honourable senators, certain remarks of the leader opposite
(Hon. Mr. Haig) compol me to rise, but I do
itot intond to speak at anv longtb. First lot
me sas- that it is sometbing new to bear
the bonourable gentleman placing so mucb
empbas3is on editorials in the W-innipog Frec
Pressa. In tbe past my bonourable friend and
bis parts' biave nover seemed to think mucb of
wbat tbat paper said about politirs or auvthing el-.e, because tbey claimod tbe paper

opposed them, but today it would appear
tbat tbe main part of lais speech is drawn from
its editorials.
My bonouralile friend suggested that Mr.
Wesson w-as really tbe fatber of the wboat
agrooment. I do not think my bonourable
friend seriously intended to cast any refleotion
upon tbe abilities of one wbio, in my opinion,
is the best Minister of Agriculture Canada
bias ever had, the Honourablo Mr. Gardiner.
The minister has taken full responsibility for
tbis wbeat contract.
I say to my honourable friend tbat not
onlv the w'heat pooî but aIl farm organizations
favour the eontract with tbe Unitcd Kingdom.
I speak from personal knowledge, for I bave
a close contact witb farmi organizations.
I
live on nn- farm and I associate w-itbi farmers
evory dav in my life wbien I am not bore. I
v enture to say that wben this contract w'as
entered into with Great Britain for the
quantity of wbeat specified. 90 per cent of
tbe farmonrs of western Canada w ero in favour
of it. Wb1v? Becau~se it gav-e tbrn stability.
Thcv knew w-bat prico tbov w-ore going to get
for their wlïeat over a certain period of time.
and tbey were able to plan tbeir activities
accordingly.
Let me remind my'bonourable friend that
wbien the Canadian Wboat Board .Act was
pas.sed in anotber place bis party votod in
f:ivour of it. And tbo prescrnt leader of the
Conservative party, before lie held that office,
w-as alw-avs in favour of a stable prico for
farm products so tbat farmers wýou!d know
exactly wbore tbey stood. Wby lias my bonourablo friend's party cbanged its position?
Becauiso it tbinks it may gain s:ome political
adviantage witb the farmers. The Conservatives also say tbey are in favour of tbe grain
excbiange. but not too murb so, becaus.e
tbev'
favour tbe wbicat board too. Tbocy are trying
to please farmers on botb sidos.
Honourable senators, I do not say tbat the
farmers would not like to roceive more for
their eommodities. But I bave spent 65 years
of my if e in tbe western country and 1 know
tbat w-bat the farmiers bave been ahways wanting is a stable market, so tbat tbey w'ould
kriow dlefnitely what tbey were to get for
evory bushol of wvheaf produerd.
And tbey
biave nox or been botter off tban thex- are tod.ay.
I strongî'
rosent the possimistic attitude of
miv bionourable friend opposite, and bis sympathy that appears ail at once for tbe farmers
His party bias nover before been so mucb conce rned over the farmors.
lIon. Mrs. FALLIS: Will tbe bon ourable
gentleman permit a question?
Hon. A. L. BEAUBIEN: Witb pleasure.

DECEMBER 19, 1947
Hon. Mrs. FALLIS: If, as my bonourable
friend says, ail the farmers of the West were
in favour of this agreement, how could the
Conservative party gain political advantage
by opposing the agreement?
Hon. A. L. BEAUBIEN: My honourable
friend's question is a logical one; but let me
point out that propaganda is an influential
We ccrtainly saw propaganda in

action before the last war and during the war,
and we have seen it since. If you get enougli
propaganda across to people you may convert them. My honourable friends have
been spreading propaganda in an effort to
create dissension among farmers and diminish
the popularity of the government; but the
seheme lias not succeeded so far. It is my
contention that my bonourable friend the
leader opposite, and his associates, are as
responsible for the wheat agreement as the
Liberal party. The leader of my friend's
party, even before lie assumed bis present
position in the other house, was in favour of
stabiizing the wheat market so that the
farmer would know what price lie would
receive. I am no more in favour of controls
than is my honourable friend. 1 should like
to sec every control removed.
But how are we going to remove controls,
with the abnormal conditions of the world
today? The goverament took the controls
off coarse -rains. What woiild have happened
if these grains had been permitted to go to
the United States? With the high price over
there we would bave deprived ourselves of
coarse grains to feed our cattle. I ask my
friend wliat would liappen if the United
States markets were opened to Canadian
cattle? In xny opinion the result would be
a depletion of our cattle and a consequent rise
in the present high cost of living. 0f course
the farmer would like to seli bis coarse grains.
and cattle to the United States.
I believe that if the farmer received 83.35
a bushel for wheat, as my honourable friend
is suggesting lie should, lie would lie no better off, because most of that extra income
would lie paid to the income tax department.
One of the difficulties of the farmer today is
to get in under the taxable income. I repeat
that if my honourable friend and bis associates think they are going to gain any political kudos with the western farmer by arguing as tliey do, I will bet him ten to one that
the farmers will flot believe tliem.
Hon. G. P. CAMPBELL: Honourable
senators, I had not intended to speak on this
motion, but my feeling that a lawyer can
always make something out of nothing was
confirmed today when I heard the honourable

present legisiation to March, 1948. It does no
more than provide the facilities by which
the government can carry out its umdertaking.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: May 1 ask my friend
what would happen if this house did not pass
the resolution?
Hon. Mr. CAMPBELL: In that case the
necessary purchasing power to carry out the
contract would be lacking.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: And the farmers could seli
on the open market?
Hon. Mr. CAMPBELL: Yes. But I arn
sure that my honourable friend would flot
now wish to get out of the obligation under
the contracts by cutting off the power of the
government to fulfil the contract.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: We would flot be preventing the government from. fulfilling the
contracts. They could buy the stuif on the
open market.
Hon. Mr. CAMPBELL: I will deal with that
point later.
My lionourahle friend has attacked the contracts on account of the price. He must have
realized at the time the contracts were entered
into that there were two parties to tliem, the
purchaser on the one hand and the vendor on
the other. True, at that time foodstuffs
throughout the world were ini very short
supply. But I judge from the remarks of the
honourable leader opposite that lie would have
been willing at that time to fake advantage of
the purchaser in order to get a higlier price.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: My friend's statement is
not correct. I saîd the people of Canada
could do as they liked, but that the farmers
should not pay the cost.
Hon. Mr. CAMPBELL: 1 take from my
friend's remark that the price of $1.55 per
hushel for wlieat was adequate at that time.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I have no way of telling
wlietlier it was adequate or not. Ail 1 know is
that, riglit or wrong, the people of Canada
agreed to it; and if the price is shown to be
Iow, they should bear the loss.
Hon. Mr. CAMPBELL- We are now in
the position that the leader opposite does not
know whether the price was higli or low at
that time. The government assumned. the
responsibility, and is standing behind the contracts today.
Let us consider the position of the western
farmer in the light of years gone by. We
know that the United Kingdom lias been the

SENATE

largest purchaser of western grains and that
the western farmer was prohibited by tariff
from selling bis wheat in the United States.
I submit that we assumed the proper role at
the conclusion of the war by entering into a
contract to supply our old customer, the
United Kingdom, with wheat at a fair price.
In view of the price of wheat in the
United States today one might raise the
question of whether or not the price to Great
Britain is low. My honourable friend the
leader opposite suggests that the people as a
whole should pay the difference in price;
but he is assuming that had the contract not
been made Canadian wheat could be sold
today in the United States.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I never mentioned the
United States. The wheat board at Winnipeg
is asking $3.35 a bushel today.
Hon. Mr. CAMPBELL: But by reason of
wheat contracts abroad there is a short supply
in Canada today. Had the contracts not been
negotiated. and had Canada a surplus of
wheat today, my honourable friend cannot
tell whether wheat would be selling at more
than $1.55 on the open market. He knows
perfectly well that great demand causes short
supply.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: If my honourable friend
has any undierstanding of the grain business,
he should know that that bas no effect one
way or the other.
Hon. Mr. CAMPBELL: I say that with a
strong demand on the open market for
Canadian grains, and a limited stock available, the price is bound to increase. I merely
say that had we not entered into these contracts, and there happened to be a large surplus of wheat on the marketHon..Mr. HAIG: But there is not.
Hon. Mr. CAMPBELL: There might very
well have been, because today we find that
the Argentine has surplus wheat, and Australia bas wheat to sell.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: She bas sold it too.
Hon. Mr. CAMPBELL: That is so. and
tomorrow or next year Russia may be elling
wheat. The purpose of the contracts was to
give stability to the farmers' economy; and
it is quite impossible to argue and, I submit,
quite unfair to suggest, that had we not
entered into these contracts the price of wheat
would have been $3 a bushel.
The purpose of the motion is simply to
enable the government to carry out purchases

from farmers in fulfilment of its contracts.
and in pursuance of a policy which is necessary in these abnormal times.
The Hon. the SPEAKER:
Honourable
senators, is it your pleasure to concur in the
motion?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: On division.
The motion was agreed to.

PRIVATE BIL
SECOND

READING

Hon. G. P. CAMPBELL moved the second
reading of Bill C, an Act respecting The Bell
Telephone Company of Canada.
H1e said: Honoura-ble sena-tors, the purpose
of this bill is to enable the company to
increase its capital from $150 million to $500
million. The explanatory notes are contained
in the present bill. I would like to, say,
however, that the requirements of the company today are such that it is anticipated
that over the next few years they will have
to spend something like $250 million on additions. During the period of the war they got
behind in the matter of installations and services to such an extent that it will take them
a few years to catch up. At the present time
there are slightly under 100,000 unfilled applications for telephone services. The present
capital stands at $150 million, of which
$126,340,900 has already been paid; another
$425,500 has been subscribed and allotted and
partially paid, and another $9,896,900 has
been sixhscribed under the employees' purchasing plan, leaving only $13,336,700 unissued
of the authorized capital.
For the purposes of the record I would state
that the original capital of this company in
1880, whcn it was incorporated, was only
$500,000. Increases authorized by statuto have
taken place in the following years: in 1884
thc capital m-as increased to $2 million in
1892 to $5 million in 1902 to $10 million in

75

1906 to $30 million, in 1920 to $75 million, and
in 1929 to $150 million, of which, as I have
said, slightly under $14 million reinains unîsQsued.'
Additions contemplated by the company for
1948 will cost over $60 million, for 1949, $60
million; for 1950, $52 million; for 1951, $51 million; and for 1952, $50 million-a total estimated expenditure of $270 million in a five-year
period. The bill simply gives the company
authority to apply to its shareholders to have
the capital increased, and application must
also, be made to the Board of Transport Commisslioners for Canada.
The other part of the bill declares that
the company has power to furnish and carry
on wireless telephone and radio systems, and
to provide services and facilities for the transmission, of intelligence, sound, television, pictures, writing and signaIs, these being subject
to the provisions of the Radio Act.
If this bill is given second reading now, I
will move that it be rcferred to the Standing
Committee on 'Bankîng and Commerce.
The motion w-as agreed to, and the bill was
read the second time.

SPEECH FROM THE THRONE
ADDRESS IN REPLY

The Senate resumed from Wednesday,
December 17, 1947, the consideration of His
Excellency the Governor General's Speech at
the opening of the session, and the motion of
Hon. Mr. Ferland foir an address in reply
thereto.
Hon. NORMAN P. LAMBERT: Honourable senators, in participating in the debate
on the Address in Reply to the Speech from
the Throne, I should like to take advantage of
the opportunity to refer briefly, and I hope
as comprehensively as necessary, to the sessions
of the General Assembly of the. United Nations,
held at New York last October and November.
First, however, may I associate myself witb
those bonourable members who have already
paid their compliments to the mover and
seconder of the motion, and express agreement with what has been said as to the excellent quality of their contribution to the
Jebate.
It was xny lot in the past to become familiar
with the livestock industry, and the particular branches of rancbing and cattle farming
which were so interestingly described by the
senator from Medicine Rat (Hon. Mr.
Gershaw). I ain in sympathy with the plea
made by my honourable friend on behalf of
that industry in western Canada. I hope that
the protracted quest of the people in southern
Alberta for a wider market for their produce
will be realized, and will result in much improved conditions in the constituency of Medicine Hat and adjoining districts, where the
people have long been successful producers of
livestock.
I should like, honourable senators,' at this
time to express my pleasure at seeîng the new
senator from Vancouver (the Right Hon. Mr.
Mackenzie) in bis seat tonight.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: I know that his
extensive knowledge of the history of this
country and bis familiarity with the Canadian
parliament, supported by a memory of remarkable capacity, will enable him to contribute much to the discussions in this chamber.
I arn personally pleased to see him. His
appearance recalls to my mind the early 30's
wben, in the days of the Liberal opposition, I
first came in contact with my honourable
friend. At that tîme it was not difficult to
tell a Liberal when you saw or heard one.
I arn sure that in bis attitude toward the
problems of this country in the future. be will
maintain the identity which stands out so
clearly in my mind today.

77

The members of the Canadian delegation to
the United Nations General Assembly in New
York last autumn undoubtedly will feel a
certain responsibility to parliament and to the
people of this country for their attendance
there. For that reason they will share the
desire to make a report before the passing of
tîme and the consideration of other matters
have completely obliterated ail interest in the
affairs of this meeting of the Assembly.
Owing to certain developments which have
taken place on this side of the Atlantic since
the end of November, we can now, perhaps,
get a clearer perspective and a fuller significance of the outstanding features of the discussions than would have been possible a few
months ago.
The last brief, futile meeting of the Foreign
Seetaries in London, just before Christmas,
bas reminded a-Il of us, I am sure, that no
formal peace to end the war in Europe or
Asia has yet been declared. The proposed
federation of Western Europe, as indicated
last week by the heads oW the British Government; the devaluation of ]Russian and European currencies; 'the progress of the Marshall
plan, with its impact on aIl Western Europe,
including Britain; and developments in Greece
and Palestine, represent revealing changes in
the world's international background since
the closing of the United Nations Assembly.
Owing to the rapid'ly changing international
scene, which makes old news of even yesterday's events, and the desire to save the time
of the Senate by avoidance of wearisome
repetition of matters which are already well
known, I have attempted to commit tc, paper
a review an'd summary of what were, I think,
the outstanding features of the United -Nations
Assembly in New York. By way of conclusion, in the second part of what I have
to say I hope to refer to some events which
have transpired since the closing ýoS the
Assembly, and wbicb make it clear, at lea..t
in my own humble view, that the continuation of the United Nations organization is a
vital necessity to the world.
I think it should be said at once that the
second regular session of the General Assembly, 'which .opened in Flushing Meadows on
September ý15 Iast, represented to the
Canadian delegation whioh attended it a
maximum of work and a minimum of recreation. I must confess that New York, for
the period of a week, bas always appealed
to me as a place for pleasure; but for two
months, as a place in which to live and work,
it has not the same appeal.
Nevertbeless, I hasten to say that I am
grateful indeed for the privilege of baving

headquarters for the United Nations Organization on an approved site overlooking East
River in New York, constituted most of the

JANUARY 27, 1948
other outstanding features of the iast meeting
of the General Assembly. Canada's influence
was feit in most of these important matters,
and particularly in connection with the
probiem of Palestine. The mai ority of our
delegates favoured supporting the report to
partition Palestine. The leading part taken
by Mr. Pearson and Mr. Riddeil on the subcommittee of the main Palestine Commiteee,
in bringing to a positive conclusion a long
and wearisome debate, represented a brilliant
contribution to the treatment of that problem.
Back of ail that went on fromn day to day
in the different committee moins at Lake
Success, however, was the growing public
estimaie of Russia's future power and influence. Trhis applied not, only to the future of
the United Nations Organization, but to the
peace of the entire world. What has transpired abroad since the end of November,' and
what is happening now, accentuate thai
thougbt even more tban was possible a couple
of m7ontbs ago. Public opinion, as reflected
in the press and -in -the comments of the man
on the street, indicates an increasing tension
over some expected break witýh Russia. By
the saine token tbere is a growing tendency
to, describe the United Nations as a symbol
of futility and unnecessary expense.
Tbere is no denying that the frank question
wbich now confronts the people of ail the
nations wbicli Iere represented at San Francisco in 1945 is whetber or not the United
Nations Organization will be able to survive
in tbe form in which it, was established. In
facing up to tbat question it must be remembered tbat the organization was flot set
up for the purpose of bringing the war to a
formai conclusion or of negotiating treaties of
peace witb Germany, Italy, Japan, Austria and
Hungary. It was set up for the purpose of
devising ways and means of maintaining international peace and security after those things
had been done, or in anticipation of their being
donc.
In the liglit of what has happened during
the past three to four months, few people
think todlay that the Aliied Nations, which
won the war, wili be able to agree upon a
series of peace treaties which wiii mark a
satisfactory settlement of the war. The emergence of a Russian desire to resist aIl influence
in Europe from the western democracies and,
if possible, to dominate that continent with
her own system. of government and power, hs
made short shrift of a formal peace conference.
Can the United Nations Organization therefore survive in the face of the present situation in Europe and Asia? Somehody of

importance said iast week, following the proposed fedieration of Western Europe, that sucli
a devclopment wouid mean the end of the
United Nations. Mr. Bevin and Mr. Churchill
certainly implied that Russia planned to
dominate the whoie of Europe, by force of
arms if necessary. But Prime Minister Attlee
said-and this is worthy of note-that this
was no timne to taik of war, but rather to
devise means of preventing war through the
United Nations.
One assumes that Mr. Bevin's important
proposai of a Western Europcan fedieration
wouid not have been made without some previous consultation with the gonvemnment of ail
the countries inciuded in such a plan. There
is reason to think, therefore, that something
in the form of a Western European bloc wili
become a reaiity. We may weli hope for
that. If it does happen, then I think that
Mr. Attiee's more moderate words suggcst not
only a wiser but a more accurate outcome of
the world situation than do those of Mr.
Churchill. The usefulness of the United
Nations as an international organization "to
take effective collective measures . . . for the
suppression of acts of aggression or other
breaches of the pence" might then be weli
justified.
The fundamental ditierences between the
Russian system of government and that in
effect on this continent are often contrasted
and emphasized; but it is not so often noted
that Russians describe their citizenship as a
democracy just as sincereiy as we do. The
contrast between these two types of democracy
wit'b tbeir different ideologies lias been strikingiy expressed recently by a brilliant young
woman in Engiand, Miss Barbara Ward. "The
West", she said, "is figbting for democracy in
the naine of religion, whule the East is figbting
religion in the namne of demnocracy". Whatever
the phiosophical distinctions between these
two conceptions may lie, one cannot seriousiy
,contempiate the w.orld being plunged into. war
primariiy on account of them. If war again
is to be regarded as inevitable, it wiil be
because of the desire cf Russia to expand ber
nationalistic power under the pretext of
security, and flot as a crusade to promote
communismn. Communism is the propagandist
weapon witb which Russia today is endeavouring to penetrate and weaken the economies of
the western democracies to the point of heipiessness and collapse. In essence, it is an
insidious form of warfare which, if it succeeded,
would render unnecessary any worldwide conflict of arms. But the increasing and undeniable evidence of Russia's tactics on thîs side,
as weli as in England and western Europe,
bas resuited in hardened resistance and refuta-

tien from the peoples of these countries. The
challenge to western ideas of freedom and
democracy is being met and overcome. The
enly immediate alternative step on Russia's
part would be nrmcd aggressien, which, according to well informed opinion, would be a
practical impossibilty for hec at the present
time.
The United Nations Organizetien stili stands
intact. It is equipped and flnenced to, serve
at leest another year. With the unanimeus
support of the delegates of ail its membernations. the decision wvas made lest November
to ereet a new permanent headquarters in
New York at a cost of S65 million. Its facilities
])revide the only meeting-place for ail1 the
world, regerdless of race, celour or creed.
Russia still nceds the United Nations, if for
nu other reason than to advance her cause
in the werld's principal forum xvhenever it is
possible to do so. Without this international
machinery, I believe wer would be inevitable.
Se long, however, as the United Nations
Organization can function even as well as it
did lest autumn, it stands as a ratienalizing
influence between two different, powerful points
of view in two different parts of the w'orld.
The presence of Russie in the United Nations
Assembly last feUl did much more good than
harm to the cause of true democracy. The
blunt frankness and theatrical skill which charecterized Mr. Vishinsky's verbal esseults upon
the socialist democracy of Britain -and the
cepitalist demecracy of the Americas did more
to enligliten and stimulete public opinion on
this side of the Atlantic than anything else
that could have happened. The speeches of
Mr. Vishinsky, eccempanied as they wece et
the very outset by the announcement fromn
Wacsaw of the revival of the Comintern, were
undoubtedly responsible for the carlier calling
of an emergency session of Congress and the
speeding up of the Marsaell plan for Eurepean
relief.
The challenge of democracy et this time is
the challenge of ideas rather than of arms; and
it is better to have the battlefields of the
future pitched on the pletforrns and in the
committee reems of the United Nations t han
in the leboratories and industrial plants of the
wocld.
Politicel freedom and so-.called responsible
the main outward
government represent
accomplisbments, of our demnocretic system,
and we know that inwardly they have given a
naturel dignity te the individual mnember of
our society. But Russýia dlaims that. capitelism
bas dominated Western democracy to the
point of using peliticel freedom te sacrifice
the economie and social security of the indiOur system of democretic gevernvidual.

ment, in answer te this challenge, must shew
bcyond any doubt that it cen centrol the
distribution, of ecenemic benefits te society as
well as uts foris, of pelitical freedýom. That is
whv flic Marshall plan fer European relief is
s0 important. It becemes e great demonstratien of the capacity of a capi-talist demecracy
te make the distributien of the ecenemie
bencflîs ef its system commensurate with its
proession of individual freedem and liberty.
It else becomes the basis ef appcoach and
understanding between the secialism of Eng]and and the capitalisrm ef Amecica.
IL romains te 'be seen bew important the
United Natiens is te Russie. The impression
ef these whe have come inte working centact
witbh the delegates frem Russia nnd ber ýtributary states is very generelly tbat Russie d'ees
not want te beceme i,,elated frem the rest ef
the world and will centinue te sbare in the
sessions ef 'the Ge-necal Assembly and the
maintenance of tbe Generel Secretariat. It is
truc tbat Russia at the recent session in New
Yerk definitcly dissociated herself from any
participation in the proposed "little Genecal
Aýssembly," the ICerean Commission and, the
Greek Frontier Commission-and this fact
is net pcemising for the continued unity of
membecsbîp in the United Nations. But
Russie cen change and; adjust her peint of
view te tliet of the majority as quickly and
effectively as any other country wben, the
realities of a situation are unmistakable; and
todav she is faced witb reelities fer more
definite then they were at the end of Nove-mAIl the deers te the "little General
ber.
Assembly," and- te tbe Korean and Greek
Frontier commissions are epen te the delegates of Russie, and tbey can take their places
there at eny time. For one, I eernestly hope
they do.
If, hewever, Russia and ber tributaries
vi tbdraw from membersbip in the United
Nations, tbe cheracter of the United Nations
and of its charter will be subject te change.
The Russians have alrcady argued et some
length tbat the adoption of a "littie General
Assembly' by the United Nations lest faîl
wvas centrary te the provisions of the charter
because it ivas e device te undermine the
Security Council. This peint was thoreughly
investigated by General Marshall and bis
advisers before the recemmendation for an
interim cemmittee te sit centinueusly between annual sessions of the General1 Assembly
was made. Article 51 of the charter was
regarded as seund censtitutienal justification
for the decisien that was made te create this
new body. At any rate, it is sitting now
in New York, concurrently with the sessions

JANUARY 27, 1948
of the Security Council; and the Canadian
delegate on the Security Council, General McNaughton, and his staff in New York, are
supposed to attend it, as well as proceedings in
the "litile Assembly."
Time alone will show how far the drastic
change of shif.ting executive responsibility
for the UJnited Nations as a whole from the
Security Council can be effected. Certainly
it cannot be done withou-t considering the
creation of an entirely new organizat-ion ' unhampered by the veto privilege of any one
power or any group of powers. One of the
vital weaknesses of the United Nations ai
present is its inability to enforce its decisions
under article 43 of the charter by the use
of miliiary sanctions. Thc situation in Palestine might be very different lfrom what it is
today if -the ýmilitary staff provided for in the
charter had been able to act. Altogether,
the future of the United Nations as at present
consiructed is ýuncertain, but flot necessarily
hopeless.
In conclusion, may 1 say of this arganization that I believe its affairs command the
close attention of ail ýmembers of parliameni.
I -trust that through the respective committees on external affairs of both houses, working
in dloser contact with the Depariment cf
External Affairs, we shahl be enabled ta keep
in touch with curreni developments, and in
our turn make them known to the people at
large.
Hon. L. M. GOUIN: Honourable senators,
in rising to support the motion for an address,
I wish first of ail to eongratulate sincerely
our colleague from Ottawa (Han. Mr.
Lambert) upan his splendid speech. I listcned
ta it with close attention and found it very
illuminating. I join wiih him in welcaming
our new colleague from Vancouver (Right
Hon. Mr. Mackenzie). I arn deligbted to
greet him with ail our traditional FrancoScottish enthusiasm.
Hon. SENATORS:

Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. GOUIN: I wish to assure him
of rny personal friendship and esteem, and
I hope that while listening ta our debate here
tonight he wil1 not regret 'that he is not in
another place.
Conditions 'throughout 'the world continue ta
be difficult and disturbing.
Such are the firsi words of the Speech from
the Throne. It adds, a. little farther on:
While unsetiled conditions still prev-ail in
Europe and Asia, Canada has continued 'ta enjay general prosperity. Employment and national income have reached levels neyer before
attained.

Honourable senators, in order Vo maintain
and to even increase employment and national
incarne, 'it is essential ta secure a steady flaw
af exports. It is nat necessary ta remind
ur
you that one-third af aur annual revenue is
derived 'from external trade. Our whale econamy is dependenti u-pan the volume-ai aur
business with other countries. Thus, as was
so aptly remarkeL by 'Mr. St. Laurent in the
Canadian Supplement of the London Times
of October 1947: "During the war Canada
became the second exporting nation af the
world".
But, as a consequence,
aur
disiinguished- M.inister for External Affairs
adds: "Canada is expasecb ta, -ihe impact af
world conditions perhaps ta a greater degree
than most. aiher countries".
The failure of Europe ta recaver from the
dislocations resulting from the recent war fbas
rendered many of our former customers
unabie ta pay for their purchases in Canada.
Their financial plight conrfronted aur government wi'th the fallowing dilemma: Either ta
let aur expar't trade suifer a most serious
interruption or Vo continue aur policy of
making boans to European. cauniries in order
ta enable them ta finance their transactions
here. The decision, of aur 'Prime Minister and
his colleagues was ta carry on aur former
program of mutual aid. For this w-ise and
statesmanlike palicy, I believe that those who
are at the helm of our ship of state deserve
ta be warmly congratulated. Oiherwise aur
goad people would bave suffered again from
unem'ployment an. a terrible scale, and the
spectre of depression would have stalked once
mare throughout this land; of ours. Here, I
am bound ta, remark that greai care muet be
taken ta pratect ourselves againsi furt-her
dislocations ini this past-war period, because
the superhumau war effort of aur relatively
small population has already taxect aur
resources 'ta their limýit. The cost of the laie
confiict represents for aur 12 million Canadians
approximaiely $19 'billion.
Mutual aid
amounts ta approximately $4 billion.
The News Yorkc World-Telegram of about
January 13 stated: "Canada bas loaned a total
of $1,850 million ta European cauntries," and
described this as "a bold and sacrificial contribution."
Indeed, in 1945, when the triumph of aur
arms was just achieved, we did not anticipate
the tremendaus addiiional burden which the
post-war period would impose upon aur Vaxpayers. Victory is proving very costly. Three
years ago we did not expect ta be obliged tai
contribute ta such an extent and for so prolonged a pcriad ta the reconstruction of the
cauntries which have served as battlefields.
0f course, we now have a sad feeliDiz "f

SENATE

frustration, disappointment and disillusionment. B3ut unless we succeed in bringing back
to wvestern Europe its productive capacity,
our whole Canadian oconomy wiIl suifer the
worst crisis in otît hi.story. Thercfore, the
onlv course whicli can produce satisfactory
resuits in the long run is the one foliowcd by
corni governument. For us, prospcrity in the
%vorld is indivisible; we cannot maintain our
national prosper:ty unlrýs we w5sure also the
prospcrity of the nations which, once our
restricted dcmestic market is satisfied, serve
as the indispensable outiet for the buge
volume of our surplus production.
Since 1945 our prospcrity bas been secured
by the plan which I have just described. I
admit that sucb means cannot be used indefinitcly. 1 know aise that this scheme is in the
nature of a long-tcrma investment. This system of financing our customers, and in fact
of advancing money to onable them to buy
or produce, is flot normal and cannot last
forever. Thus, our prosperity during ail these
past years lias been te a great degrec artificial,
and a day xvas biund to come when we would
practically reachi the breaking point. This
day came ncar the end cf last ycnr when our
foecign exchange position wvas considcrcd
critical enoughi to justify the adoption nf
varlous nieasiires of an ecmergencyý nature.
Commenting upon our present crisis about
ten davs age, an American newspaper, the
Neuport Express, pointcd out that "Canada
lias loaned Britain many millions nf dollars
and is now fighting for lier economie life."
1 wish very sineerely te thank our gond
neiglibours for tlieir synipathy, but at the
saine time I want to reassure thema. Concerning the final outcomie of our present struggle
I have ne doubt and ne fcar. Our situation is
ccrtainly difficuit, but it dees net justify any
alarm. W/e have donc more than our share
towards wiening tlîe war; we are fuily dotermincd te continue or total offert te win the
peace, andi witlî tlie help of Ged, te whom we
have' owed se much in the past, wr' will
triumph ence more. It is of course a case of
hielping ourselves if we want ileaven te lielp
us-Aide-toi et le Ciel t'aidera, as wc say in
French.
Our governmen.t has already taken the
necessary measures te conserve and supplement Canada's reserve of United States dollars. Those provisions, of a purely temporary
character, deserve the fullest support of the
Canadian people. Such restrictions as have
been imposed are clearly unpleasant, te accept,
particularly as or previeus voluntary sacrifices have been surpassed by those of ne
other country.
Though a Liberal by conviction, as well as
by tradition-and I arn net ashamed of either

quclification-though an ardent believer in
freedom and a persistent epponent of socialism, communisîn or totalitarianismn in any
forîn or shape, I consider the re-establishment
cf contioch acd the temporcry imposition of
certain limitations te our econemie liberty as
absolutely necessary, and the only means
avcilcll te check the present crisis. I believo
in frecdom; but our exporience in the decade
followicg 1929 has convinced me-and it
should aIse have convinced ail my felloiv
Canadians-that freeom is net sufficient te
cure all evils. It xvas and is indeed the duty
cf our government, in the interest of ail or
poptulation, te prevont any unnecessary forther indebtedness te the United States. W/e
mnust net only maintain our aircady depleted
supply cf United States dollars, but take the
Pt oper stops te replenish our coffers with the
so-callcd 'bard mcney". For thget purpese, I

should we try te dovelop the volume of our

and icss sentimental.

relaxation cf this prohibition, absolute frocdem cf trade ie such a commodity is net
now possible, because it would cause a very
serious scarcity cf meat in Canada. 1 know
aise tlîct wo have assumned further commitmonts te Great Bnitain for the supply cf
beef and othor commodities. Many factors
must ho taken into consideratien, and I suggest that at the earliest eppertunity we should

JANUARY 27, 1948
study when and how it may be feasible ta
establish a quota system for the sale of some
af aur cattie on the American market. This
is only ona illustration, among athers. I
understand that the proper department Ls
giving ail its attention ta a readjustment of
our national economy.
To suma UP, aur exports ta the United States
or ta other dollar areas must ba increased
in a definite way. In the past, for aur external
trade, we used only two baskets, sa ta speak.
We were for the most part filling the British
basket with aur gaads, and for aur needs we
were drawing mainly from the American
basket. It has become evident that new
markets and new outiets must be developed.
Our government lias fully rcalized that necessitv. Trade missions have been sent oversens
and foundations have be-en laid succassfuily
for aur future commercial relations.
The most encouraging development in this
vital matter is embodied in the Geneva Trade
Agreements. There we find, at least ta a great
extent, a permanent solution of aur exchangc
problems. Our representatives at Geneva and
aur government deserve ta be congratulated on
the brilliant part played by Canada in securing the conclusion of these arrangements
between aur country and eightaen othar
nations. As stated in the Speech froma the
Throne, "the future well-being of the nation
depends upon tha revival of world trade."
"A positive achievement."
Such is the
graphie expression used ta, deseribe the result
of the last conference at Geneva. Indeed it is
"a positive achievement". It is aven mare
than that for ail those wha belong ta the samne
school of political thought as mysaîf; for us
it is the realization after many years of a
dreami always kept alive in aur hearts-the
great and noble dream of freer trade among
ail nations. True Liberals have always considered bigli tariff barriers as sometbing
unnatural, and wa have accepted protection
only as a lasser evil. I am nat a Liberai
doc~trinaire, and I believa in the prin-ciple of
economic evolution in a graduai and practicai mannar. I am nat at ail an advacate of
hasty and radical changes. Sucli is nat tbe
way of nature. I say that under the wise and
truly Liberal administration of Mr. King,
wbose record is second ta that of nana of the
greatest statesmen now alive, under the really
progressive and efficient regime of aur present
Prime Minister and bis colleagues, we are
maving constantiy and safely towards greater
frecdomn in ail aur national fields of activity.
Freer international trade is a constructive step
towarde worid peaca, and aven towards aur
ever cherished goal of human bratberhood.

Honourable senatars, those two wards
"buman brotherhoad" have for us a sacred
rneaning. They are the corner-stone of aur
democracy in North America. Indeed, without a true spirit of Christian brotherlhood
among ail aur races, ail aur faiths and ail aur
classes, Canada cannot progress, or aveu surv ive permanently. Fully reaiizing in aur
national life tbe necessity of having for ail aur
fellow-Canadians a truiy fratarnal heart, we
embrace alsa in aur humanitarian ideal aur
external relations. Yas, in spite of ail the
dark clouds wbieh are now hanging over us,
we firmly believe in the brotherhood of states
and sisterhood of nations.
Humanitarianism is aur guiding star in
world affairs, becaiise we are inspired and
moved by the admirable exampie of a great
patriat and a great bumanitarian, ane who
during almost a quarter of a century bas presided successfully over the destinies of aur
peopla-our beloved leader, the Right Honourable William Lyon Mackenzie King. It is
with a painful sense of sorrow that I contemplate the day of his retirement after bis
many years of publie service, which form same
of the greatest chaptars of our national
bistary.
During the critical years of the early
twanties, and more racently, during the tragia
periad of the last world war and its deprassing
afterinatb, the first citizen of aur Canadian
demacraey bas davated ail the bours of his
life, ta serving aur country and humanity.
From tbe time of his youth ha bas taken as
bis modal the illustriaus French scientist Louis
Pasteur. For this immartal benafactor of the
buman race Mr. King has always shown deep
and sincere veneration. Ha bas learned fram
bis great master that mankind bas ta choose
batwaen the law of blaad and of death on
ana sida, and the law of peace, work and
healtb, on the other. As an apostia of
Christian democracy, Mr. King bas dedicated
himaself ta the sacred cause of peace-intarnai
peace as well as world peace. klîs destiny bas
iînposed upon bis shoulders bath the burden
and tbe glory of being a great war leader.
During the entira period of the lata confliet
the mast anxiaus dasire of this peace-loving
statesman was, ta use bis own words, ta bring
bostilities "ta a victoriaus close at the earliest
possible day." Tbanks ta tha courageous
leadership of aur Prime Ministar, Canada in
proportion ta bar rasourcas bas elone more
than any country in the worid ta defeat the
enemies of mankind. Thare is no doubt that
aur superhuman contribution ta victary bas,
justly entitled us, as ciaimed by Mr. King
'ta share effectively in tha making of peaca".

SENATE
At first, apparently, none of our great friends,
1 mean the great powers, would lift one finger
in order to admit us to the preliminary peace
talks. No! There was no room at the round
table for a Canadian. Before the situation
had deteriorated as much as it has now, we,
as a middle power inspired only by the democratie ideal of justice, could have played a
most useful part in trying to keep dhe Big
Four together. Mr. King-history proves ithas saved our country by consolidating our
national unity when we were threatened with
civil strife; bis splendid record speaks for
itself; and I arn convinced that he would have
cxerted a most beneficial and unifying influence
upon our former allies before bitter antagonisma
separated them into two unfriendly groups.
To quote bis own words at the Paris conference
in 1946, Mr. King would have satisfied every
one thatCanada seeks no territory, no reparations, no
special concessions of any kind, but we do seek
to build a ]asting peace. Canada's interest in
peace springs from deep within the heart of
Canada's nationhood.
Yes, we are a peace-loving country, and we
are convinced that peace can still be obtained
and preserved. In these days, so reminiscent
of 1939, humanity can yet be saved by those
who share the unshaken faith of our Prime

Minister in the brotherhood of man and the
Fatherhood of God. I pray to ileaven that
the ideal which. Mr. King inherited frorn
Pasteur-his ardent belief in the law of peace,
work and health-may deliver us from the
scourge of the law of blood and death. 0
Lord! May aIl our fellow men and women
who are tempted to think that the lines of
battle are already set, understand that our
only ambition as Canadians is to live in peace
among ourselves and with the rest of the
world; to develop peacefully our resources;
to have peaceful and even friendly relations
with aIl other peace-loving peoples of the
earth and, faithful to the Christian and
humanitarian creed of our great Liberal
leader, "to hold to the end of our days, our
enthusiasm for human betterment."
Such
indeed is our goal for ever. But of course we
add-and let there be no mistake about it:
"0 Canada, we stand on guard for thee!"

i'ormed (o maintain. peace and seeurity, and (o
bring about by peaceful mecans (he sottiomont
ni' international disputes, a groat hope arose
amongst ail (ho nations oi' (lie xvorld. In (ho
purpose ni' (ho United Nations' Organization-

JANUARY 28, 1948

to impart a common welfare to all men-people
in all regions of the world foresaw the establishment at once of an era of concord, collaboration and fraternity, based on justice and
liberty.
In their great joy they did not
apprehend that it was difficult to maintain
peace before peace was established, before all
the social, political and economie crises brought
about by the last war were eliminated, and
before all the sources of human miseries were
dried up.
They thought, in their naive joy, that such
an organization would at once banish all the
causes of international trouble, and would
bring about a universal accord. They did not
realize that in order to effectuate not only a
practical and reasonable solution, but a settlement acceptable to all, the organization
would be called upon to pronounce upon all
the doubts, all the suspicions, all the d.isputes,
and all the conflicts amongst the peoples of the
world. So last year, when disagreements arose
at the Security Council, when the same nations
who created the United Nations were unable
to agree, when the quarrel between the East
and the West became acute, the United
Nations' Assembly was subjected to a serious
test. Created to preserv;e peace, this organization is operating before the peace terms have
been settled, before the major peace treaties
have been signed, and so has had to face a
series of political disputes which have divided
the world into two hostile camps.
Viewing this state of affairs, public opinion,
still under the tension of the last war and
shaken by the dramatized news of the press,
has immediately concluded that the dissolution of the United Nations is near, and even
that another war is in the offing; but after
listening to most of the debates for two months
I have come to the conclusion that no matter
how strong political differences may be, the
situation does not constitute a threat to the
existence of the United Nations. Whilst it
may be true that the great powers suspect one
another, or each other's intentions, and are
not prepared to accept the decisions of other
states on many questions affecting what they
deem to be their own welfare, yet no nation
thinks of war, wants war, or would tolerate
war. No nation has either pronounced itself
against the principles contained in the charter
or manifested any intention to withdraw from
the United Nations. On the contrary, the
fifty-seven nations which are members of the
organization, and which represents 80 per cent
of the world's population, have not only expressed a fervent desire to maintain peace,
but have pronounced themselves as absolutely
opposed to all forms of aggressions. But they
are not in accord as to the best means to take
5853-8

or to follow to achieve that desired end. In
short, the deduction to be gathered from the
debates up to the present tire is that there is
a determination that the United Nations organization has to survive, to solve in common
all the economic and social problems of which
it is seized, and to fulfil its duties towards
humanity in conformity with the principles
enunciated in the charter.
In its brief but already fruitful existence,
the United Nations Organization has to its
credit an impressive record of decisions
reached and actions taken in every field of its
responsibility. At its last meeting no less than
sixty different items of business appeared on
its agenda for which a solution had to be
found, and was found. It acts in co-operation
with specialized agencies that have been
admitted to form part of its organization,
such as the International Labor Organization;
the Food and Agricultural Organization, which
is apportioning the food resources of the world
amongst distressed countries; the Educational,
Scientific and Cultural Organization; the
International Civil Aviation Organization, and
others. It has established a commission on
human rights, a social commission, a commission on transport and communications, a commission on the status of women, a fiscal
commission, a commission on statistics, an
international refugee commission, and a world
health organization, which works faithfully
and well in this dislocated world to prevent
the spread of contagious diseases. It has
created an International Court of Justice
whose function is to decide, in accordance
with international law, such controversies as
are submitted to it. It has established and
put in operation, under its authority, an international trusteeship system for the administration and supervision of territories heretofore
under a mandate, principally to encourage
respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all, without distinction as to race, sex,
language or religion. In fact, the rapidity of
the growth of the United Nations' Organization
and the diversity of tasks entrusted to it are
without parallel.
Add to this that it has directed public
opinion towaids a union in a comprehensive
system to assure to all a greater security, and
that it has provided, in the General Assembly,
a tribunal where all causes of international
disputes are decided solely upon merit, and
you have a faint idea of this co-operative and
collective organization of fifty-seven nations,
working in solidarity to assure a lasting peace
and to advance the welfare of all countries.
But, honourable senators, there are shades
in this tableau. Though the General Assembly

SENATE

is of great weight as a vital forum of world
opinion and as a medium through which
smaller nations may express their views, it is
subsidiary in many ways to the Security
Ceuncil, whjch is charged with the maintenance of international peace and security.
The Gencral Assembly may discuss anything and make recemmendations thereon,
but it lias practically -ne power, witheut the
aid cf the Security Council, te enforce its
It therefore fellows that, the
decisiens.
Sccurity Ceunicil is the body that carnies out
the recommendations of the General Assembly. Established as a place where, in the last
rcsort, differences ceuld be settled and situations appeased, it hias become frezen in its
actions because cf the abusive use of the

tolerable that such a situation should continue te exist in the Sccurity Council.
It must be rcmernbered that the United
Nations lias 'been in existence for only twe
ycars, during rwhich it lias been werking on a
pregramn se vast that liandlcd etherwise it
might have taken generatiens te complete.
It must be undcrstood that the United Nations
was neyer expected te play the rele of a
peace confercoce. On the contrary, the peace
treaties were te, be nego-tiated bv the belligercnt powers immediately concernied.
1 venture te say that once the peace
treaties are signcd, the international tension
will beceme lcss acute and the United, Nations
will have a long -and useful existence ahead.
This is the first time in the bistery of the
world that. on such a scale, an erganization
of this kind, has, been seized of aIl the international problems of the werldi; and se it
scems te me tbat nethwithstandýing the difficulties in the Security Council there is ne

and divided the opinions within the United
Nations, the actual situatien dees net
censtitute a serious threat te its existence. On
the centrary, these discussions have had the
surmeuntingfears,
dissipating
cffect cf
deubts, modcrating straineci relations and
bringing minds te a better understanding.
Many such difficulties bave already been
settled and others arc constantly being
remeved.
In erder te succecd it is necessary te
inculcate in ahl the member nations a confidence in their erganizatien; te maintain the
spirit ef selidarity and international ce-eperatien which prevailcd when the erganizatien
was feunded; and, te replace hatred by love,
violence by fraternal understanding, and
disunion by union.

Canada, always maintaining its faitb in the
United, Nations and always wihling te, ce-operate te the full in initiatives that tend, te
increase the fraternal selidarity cf people
and procure peace and international secunity,
bas net hesitated te accept mcmbership in the
Security Counicil, in aIl the deliberations of
which our representative will strive te promote the spirit of justice and conciliation.
The election of Canada te the Security
Ceuncil is net only a token of csteem and
confidenco on the part of the other statesmembers, but a tribute te this country for the
great contribution it hias brougbt te the affairs
of the organization.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. LEGER:
Canada as a demecratic country, free from aIl the political
quarrels which divide the world, desireus cf
maintaining peace and contentment within the
universe, will henourabhy diseharge its duties
in the Security Ceuncil. as it bias donc in the
General Assembly. Ils 'contributions in, this
newv field wiII be appreciable and apprcciated.
I concludo by affirming that the United
Nations Organization will survive its present
difficulties; that it wihl continue te work
faithfully and ivelI, and will accemplish the
grcat task fer which it was establishced.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon, W. RUPERT DAVIES: ilonourable
senators, befere undertaking te, participate in
the debate on the Address in reply te the
Speech frem the Throne, I should like te
extcnd miy word of welcome te the new
senater from Vancouver (Rigbt Hon. Ian
Mackenzie).
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. DAVIES: I am sorry that I was
unable te be present yesterday when the right
honourable gentleman was introduccd, but last
nigbt was an important one in the prospereus and up-and-ceming city of Kingston,
being the occasion of the annual banquet cf
the Kingston Chamber of Commerce. It was
my privilege te introduce the guest speaker,
the Henourable Lionel Chevrier, Federal
Minister cf Transport, who gave a very fine
address. Incidentally, te show that we are
net biased in Kingston, hast year we invitcd
Premier George Drew te, address us.
I am sorry aIse that thc heneurable senator
from Lethbridge (Hon. Mr. Buchanan) is net
in bis place this aftcrnoon, because 1 should
like te, congratuhate him on complcting forty
years as editor and publisher cf the Lethbridqe
Hcereld. I know the honeurable senater from
,Halifax (lIon. Mr. Dennis), wbomn I arn very

JANIJTARY 28, 1948
glad to see in bis place today, will agree with
me that it bas nlot been given to many Canadian newspaper publishers to found, a daily
newspaper, and then to edit and publish it
continuously for forty years. That is the
accomplishrnent of the honourable senator
froin Lethbridge, who during the saine period
bas found tirne to serve the public of Canada,
first in the Aiberta Legislature, then in the
House of Commons, and finally, for nearly a
quarter of a century in this honourable house.
This gives me an opportunity to say just
one word about the Senate. I arn sick and
tired of ail this talk about the Senate: what
it. does not do, what it should do, and what
oughit to be done about it. I have found
that the less people know about the Senate
the more they have to say about it. I heartiiy
agree with the honourable senator fromn Winnipeg (Hon. Mr. Haig) in his symposium on
the Senate, which was carried recentiy by a
big Toronto financial newspaper. He said
that this house was largely non-political.« In
that I agree with hirn. I believe it is 95
per cent non-political, and that, I feel, is what
makes it a very valua;ble body. This is rny
sixth session here, so I arn practically a newcorner; but like ail newcorners, a few weeks
after corning into the Senate I thought that
I had a few ideas on what could be done with
the Senate. Many long years ago, at the age
of sixteen, I joined a debating society, andyou can believe it or not-our first subject
of debate was "The abolition of this Senate."
Honourable senators will recail that that was
one of the planks in the 1896 platform. of the
great statesman Sir Wilfrid Laurier. W 1ell, the
Senate bas not yet been abolisbed, and 1
hope it neyer will be; and I hope that nothing
will be done to change it. I think the Senate
is ahl right just as it is. 1 bave no syrnpathy
whatever with the contention that appointments should be made by the provinces, tbat
there should be an age lirnit for senators, and
sO on1.

Some Hon. SENATORS:

Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. DAVIES: I have no sympathy
at ail witb those arguments. The Senate is
a very valuabie body, as the people would'
realize if they wuuld .only pay sorne attention
to what it has done. But how can you expect
the people to know what the Senate is doing,
when even the press gallery does nlot know?
A certain well-kn.own publication, ca'lled New
Liberty, has been much in the news lately.
A few weeks ago its Ottawa correspondent
said -that members of the Senate and the
House of Commons hiad increased their indemnities by 32,000 a year and had taken
5853-8j

89

good care to see that this inerease was free
fromn incorne tax. Well, as of course everybody in this bouse knows, the increase of
$2,000 in tbe senatorial indernnity is nlot free
from taxation. Wben that kind of tbing is
handed out through a magazine with a circulation of 200,000, you do not wonder why
people are so mixed up about tbe Senate.
Two sessions ago, the Senate sent tbe
Foreign Excbange Control Bill back to the
House of Cornrons with sixty-seven asnendments, every one of which was accepted. by
that bouse. Tbat is just one indication of
the work that the Senate does. I think thaît
the less attention we pay to .these people who
talk about reformning the Senate, and doing
this and -that with it, the better it will be for
this body and for Canada as a whole.
Now I want to say a 'word or two about
the Speech fromn the Throne. 1 do not know
much about economics. Last nigbt 1 listened
to the Minister of Transport as hie told us
why we have to do this, that and tbe other
thing. He told us that we are very short
of United States dollars. To try to cope
with the cost of living 'by rolling back prices
to 1946 levels, he said, would cost the people
of this country h.undreds of millions of dollars in subsidies. As bie rernarked, there are
various schools of thought on how the present
situation should be remedied. One suggestion is that the excess profits tax shouid be
reimposed. I sincerely hope t-hat will not
be done, or if it is done, that it will be more
equitably imposed than it was during the
war.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. DAVIES: The excess profits tax
that was enforced during the war was in my
opinion rnost unfair. Companies which hgd
made big proifits during the four basic years
were allowed to retain ail but 40 per cent,
whereas companies which for various res.sens
had made smaîl profits during the basic years
had to give up 100 per cent of their annual
profits above that basic average. I admit
that there is to be a 20 per cent rebate soe
day. That tax worked a great hardship on
rnany businesses. I speak particularly of some
newspapers with which I arn welI acquainted.
If we must have another excess profits tex,
the whole question should be carefully studied
before the new act is put on the statute books
of this country. We should nlot have the samne
act that we had during the war.
As I said earlier, I do not know much about
econornics. I do know, however, that the cost
of living has gone very high. On the Kingston
market about two weeks ago I paid 37 cents
for haîf of a smaîl cabbage. I do not care

SENATE

much for paying an extortionate price like
that; I would rather be able to buy cabbages
at five or ten cents apiece. These high prices
resuit freim various conditions over which
uobody seems to have any control at the
present time, and it is the people with sinall
fixed incemes who have been bit the hardest.
People in business may adjust their revenues
to meet increasing expensos, and employees
can ask for, and ustiallv i-an get, an increasc in
wages or a cost of living bonus, but people
with small fixcd (r cornes outside of tlîc-e
classes are having a very hard time to make
ends meet.
I wisb te deal for a few minutes with the
report of the Uncmploymient Insurance Coinmission. The commission is doing a vciy good
job, but I airn not quite convineed tlîat it is on
the righit track. At a public meeting in Quebec
-this weck, I think-tbe Minister of Labour
said that last ycar, the National Employment
Service had placed 769,849 workcrs, including
13,600 handicapped men and womnen, and
248,095 veterans, 7,105 of whom were liandicapped. Dealing witb imigration of displaced persens, the minister said these would
meluide 5,500 woods workers, 2,516 clothing
workers, 3,000 domestie workers, 3,234 hcavy
labourers, 1,000 building constr uction workcrs,
2,050 outside rural construction workers, 2,000
agricultural w'orkers, 2,457 metal mincis, 200
textile wnrkers and 100 boot and shoe workers.
That is a very fine record. 1 might reniart
bore that 1 hav e bcd somcthing te do witb a
cmiber of displaced peisons wbo hiave corne
te Canada, and they have turned eut very
satisfactoî'ily indeed.
Speaking in this lieuse aboeut twe vears age,
1 expressed doubt xvhetlier it was necessary fer
tii< tJntiriloyinentInric Comniî-sion te
liiild up suecb enermeus rcservos. On page 7
of the presenit report we are told that cmp&csandî emîilovces l)egan coîutribi ting, te
the fund on July 1, 1941, nnd that at the end
cf the 1946-47 fiscal year the net balance in
the fond w-as $372.878.625.65. Tlîe futnd bias
alreadv paid eut S82,539,424.99 in benefits te
enlitlcd persons tomperarily uncmpleyed. On
pagte 32 wc find that the assets cf the cerninision at present are more than $373 million.
The conîiiision's total inceme in the last
fiscal year w-as nearly $99.000,000, nnd its paymients eut w-cie about $43,000,000, lcavicg a
net cf about $55,000,000.
1 do net knew
wvhetbor it is necessary for thý commission te
haîve se large a net ancual inceme, becauise I
ficd tbat frein September, 1930, when relief
legi-dation xvent inte effect. rictil March 31,
1936, the total spent by the federal gevercment foir relief purpeses. iccluding werks and
direct relief, was $204,838 007.

I do neot propose te question serieusly
wbether the L'cempleyment Insurance Comnmission is collecting tee much from the cmuploy-er and the empîcyc.
My main bone of
contention is tliat the Unempîcyment Insurmire Act bias been amended by order in council
se that the employer is cempelled te pay fer
somnething for which ne one gets any return.
The commission's insurance bulletin No. 5,
in a section dealing with part-turne employment, says:
AIl certificates of cxcepted em)pîcyiient will
cea.se to lie effectiv e Deceinber 31, 1947.

JANUARY 28, 1948

Dominion of Canada. A reader wrote to tbe
Timies asking what Canada had done during
the war, and this is the reply:
Canada lias made a postwar loan of $1,250,000,000 to Great Britain. In this connection, it should
be noted that Canada lias ýalso made credits
totalling $650u,000,00'0 available to other European countries. And she lias advanced about
$275,000,000 as direct postwar relief in the military zones and through UNRRA and the International Refugee 'Organization. This ýaltogether
makes more than two billions wbich Canada liaýs
advanced for postw.ar relief and reconsruction.
However, these figures cannot be appreciated
until they are compared with- American resources. Canada has a population which ýis
about one-twelfth that of the United States.
Therefore, on the basis of population, America

would have to loan some $15,000,000,000 to Eng-

land to equal Canada's effort. ;On the basie of
income, we would bave to b4an some $25,000,000,000. And to equal ail of Canada's postwar boans
and advances. Amerjea would have to raise
frýom $25,000,000,000 to $40,000,000,000.
Canada's postwar boan is -only one example
of assistance to the mother country. During the
war our northern neiglibour contnibuted more
than a billion in outrigbt gif ts ýto Britain's cause.
At present she is selling wheat to Britain at 'a
price considerably lower than that of the world
mnarket. Sncb gifts -and advances, -all requiring
some American dollars, are the reason that
Canada must now hoard the American dollars
she hbas lef t and ask credit f rom us.
Our congress is now h.aggling over a Marshall
Plan for Europeýan recovery that will cost an
estimated $17,000,000,000. Tho"e who doulit we
can raise that muci 'are advised to, look ýat
Let no one suggest that
Canada's record.
Canada ie not doing ber f ull share toward the
recovery of both her mother country and Europe.
We are ahl proud of Canada, and it is a great
country, but unless we do something about
communism I arn fearful of what will bappen
to us. I think we are playing with fire, and
that some drastic steps should be taken to
counteract this menace. Some people eupbemistically refer to it as a "different ideolýogy"
or a "lefti8t ideology". I do not tbink cornmunism is an ideology at ahl, but a direct
attempt to control this country from Moscow.
We frequently read tbat statesmen such as
Prime Minister Mackenzie King and Premier
Drew have spuken very strongly on tbis sub-

ject. I do flot think tbey can speak too
strongly. It is my belief that the time bas
corne when the Parliament of Canada should
outlaw communism. I see no reason why we
should tolerate it. There are in our universities professors who are avowed communists.
I ask honourable senators how long wou.ld one
be permitted to publish a demnocratic newspaper in Moscow? Yet, I arn told, we allow
two or three dozen communist papers to be
published in Canada.
As I picture conditions today, Canada represents a huge door labelled the "Canadian way
of life", and there is a big black bear nosing
around the bottom of that door trying to,
open it. Eventually, if we are flot careful,
that bear will get bis nose in the door and,
according to the old story, he will next get
bis paw in, then bis shoulders, and eventually
the whole bear will be in. As far as 1 arn
concerned, I would like to see the door
slammed shut tight, and I would not care if
in the process it took the tip of the nose off
that big black bear.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. HAIG: With leave of the Senate,
I would move that the name of the Honourable R. B. Horner be added to the list of
senators serving on the Standing Committee
on Divorce.
I may say, in explanation, that the Committee on Divorce cannot sit in two sections tomorrow without the appointment of another
member. The leader of the government, who
unfortunately is absent from his seat at tbe

SPEECH FROM THE THRONE
ADDRESS

IN REPLY

The Senate resumed froin yesterday the
consideration of His Excellency the Governor
General's Speech at thc opening of the session, and the motion of Hon. Mr. Feriand for
an addrcss in reply thereto.
Hon. IVA C. FALLIS: Honourable senators,
in rising to speak for a short time in this
debate, I shouid like to associate myseif with
the speakers who have preceded me in extending my sincere congratulations to the mover
and seconder of the Address in repiy to the
Speech from the Throne.
As was said ycsterday by the hionourable
senator from Ringston (Hon. Mr. Davies), this
is a debate in wvhich we are allowed to roam at
will without fear of bcing calleci to ordor. So
for a few minutes 1 should like to avail myseif
of this opportunitv to taik to honourable
senators about food-food for ourselves and
for others. During the last few weeks I have
iistened to several Canadian womcn speaking in
different parts of Ontario, women w'ho have
rccently returned froin Engiand and the
EFuropean continent, ani they were unanimous
in saying that the focal point of ail conversation both in Engiand and on the continent,
wherever two or three were gathered together,
was the topic of food. We are rapidly approaching that situation in Canada today. No douht
many honourable members read in the December 1 issue of Maclean's an article by L. S. B.
Shapiro, entitled "Will Stalin's Bread Conquer
Europe?" The substance of the article eouid
ho summed up in twvo sentences. First: Russia
can win Europe without firing a single shotHow?-by a blow to the empty stomach. And
the second sentence: This is a war; the wcapon
is food.
The importance of the part whichi this
continent can play in su-pplying the weapon
to flght this food war has been stressed by
many speakers in many places, but I think
no one has put it more conciseiy and more
forcefuliy than Mr. Charles Luckman, Chairman of the Citizens' Food Committee of the
United States. Speaking at the inauguration
of a campaig-n in the United States to save
food for starving Europe, and thereby to
attempt to stem the all-too-rapid advance of

communism there, Mr. Luckman said: "The
arsenal of democracy must now become the
gr-anarv of thie world, or we shall bury our
hopes for peace with those who died to
preserve it." So the question oof more food
production on this continent becomes a question of importance not to the producers only,
but to every Canadian citizen who is concerned with the survivai of democracy.
Unfortunately, at least ia my provinceand today 1 speak, only of Ontario, for I am
more familiar with conditions here-there is
a growing tendency to produce iess food
insteud of more. It is ea-sy to say that we
inust h)ave more food; it is not s0 easy to
ansxver the question of how greater production
is to be assured.
It is certain that if we are to have more
food produccd in this province the producers
must he assured of two things. First, they
niust have a rcasonably stable market. In
that connection I would refer honourable
senators to what took place at the annuai
meeting of the Fruit and Vegetable Growers
Associa tion of Ontario, hoe-Id in western Ontario
last week. The members of that association
wer'e advised by their leaders not to indulge
in over-production, and to be very careful
in their planning for the next year until they
knew wvhat xvas to ho the goveroment's poiicy
on the importation of fruits and vegetabies
from the United States.
The second requisite to greater production
is adequate remuneration to tise producers
for tjieir products.
To achieve titat end
something would have to bo done to bring
a-bout a botter understanding in this country
betwcen the produccrs of food and tise consumoers.
Tise average city dweiler today
knows littie or nothing about -the cost of
producing articles of food, and -per.haps icares
less. What ho or she is particularly concerned
witlh is tIse buying of food at the iowest possible prico, wisicis is quito natural.
Very ofîen while attending womený's organizations and clubs I have lieard this statement made- "I cannot, afford 'to buy sufficient
quantities of eggs or milk for my family
because the prices are ton, higli." Remarks
to that effect are made repeated;ly. But doos
anynne ever hear this question asked: "Can
the producers afford to take any less for the
fond whlsi they are producing? It seems to
me that those twn observations must go
togetiser, because it is a foolish economy
which would base the prico of foodstuffs on
any fouindation other than the cnst of
produxction.
As I sec conditions today, the chief dýifficulty with respect t0 the feeling about high
prices arises from the fact that ail through the

JANUARY 29, 1948

years the Canadian people have been accustomed to cheap food. That bas been true
tbroughout the entire history cif the country,
except for the war years. During the recent
war subsidies re]ieved the situation to a
great extent, but when they were lift.ed food
prices found their natural level, and the
trouble began.
The cheap food that Canadians have
enjoyed through 'the ycars was made possible largely because the farmer bad neyer
heard of an eight-hour day. H1e worked fromý
twelve to sixteen- bours a day, accordin-g to
the season, to produce cbeap food for tbe city
dweller. And not only did the farmer work,
but bis wife workcd as well, and, the children
belped too from. the time they were able to do
anytbing at all. Furtber, one or two grown
sons vcry often did their part. Perhaps haîf a
dozen people were combining their effuî'ts tu
produce cbeap food, but there was only one
income in the home. The war put an end to
tbat condition, and niow the pictuýre bas
cbanged completely.
Honourablé senators are more or less familiar
witb conditions in the country today, but
perhaps, to bring the facts home more clearly,
I may give an illustration. Like the bonourable senator from Winnipeg (Hon. Mr. Haig)
I use my own city as an example, because I
know more about it than any other place.
Peterborough, for its population, is one of
the most bighly industrialized towns in the
dominion. It is surrounded on four sides hy
a very fine agricultural district. If you drive
tbrougb that district today you will find that
the farms bave been drained of their young
men, who, under conditions of ordinary industrial activity in the country, would be
belping to produce food. But tbey are not
there; they are in the factories in Peterborough, and there tbey are going to stay
unless unemployment in the city drives them
back to the farms. I bave talked to some of
these y-oung men, and I bave put the question
to them in this way: "Now there are fairly
good prices for farmi products; there is a
terrifie shortage of food in the world; why do
you not go back to tbe farms to help in the
production of this food which is so badly
needed?" The replies I have received are
something like this: "Do you think I'm
crazy? Why sbould I gîve up a good job in
whicb I bave to, work only eight bours a day,
to go back to, the farm and work twelve hours
a day, and get less money for it? Nothing
doing!1" That is the picture as we have it
today. So when we are calling for a greater
production of food in this country we must
bear in mind that-in this province at any
rate-we are asking the older men, the men of

93

middle age and above middle age, many of
wbom are weary from the effects of long bard
years of work during the war, to do more than
bas been done in order to produce more food.
In my opinion tbere is only one way by wbich
greater food production can be attained, and
that is by inaking sure that the pruducer
receives sufficient remuneration to enable bim
to purcbase tbe most modern labour-saving
machinery available and to pay bis workers-if hie is fortunate enough to get help-wages
comparable to those paid in industry. Otherwise tbe workers will go back to the "bright
ligbts"; tbey will flot stay on the farms. So
the two conditions to which 1 bave referred
will bave to be met if we are even to maintain
the present volume of production, let alone
increase it. If the producer is not given
sufficient remuneration, lessened production
will resuit: we shall bave scarcity in our
midst, and we shall not be able to provide
that weapon of food which Shapiro says is
necessary if we are to stem the tide of coinmunistic advance in Europe.
Tbat is one side of the picture. I freely
admit that there is another side, represented
by the terrific struggle which people in the
]ow-income brackets in our towns and cities
today are having to eke out anything hetter
than a bare existence. I find that, because of
the struggle tbey are having, and because of
the high prices they have to pay for food,
there is growing up among them a resentment
against the producer. They feel that the producer is taking advantagc of the situation to
charge exorbitant prices. That feeling can
only be overcome by furnishing the public
witb more information. I believe that in evcry
province information on the average cost to
the producers, of basic and necessary foods,
and the prices which the producers receive
for these foodstuffs, sbould be made available
to the consumer, so that bie may judge for
bimself whethcr the producer is receiving an
exorbitant profit on bis costs of production.
I was interested in a speech which was made
in Orillia in December by Honourable T. L.
Kennedy, Ontario's Minister of Agriculture. He
put on record somne figures showing the prices
which consumers in Ontario were paying for certain produets and the proportion of those prices
reoeived by the producers. 1 may say that
canncd vegetables were at that time selling at
pretty high prices in this country, perhaps
higher than today, and therefore there may be
sligbt differences. At that time canned tomatoes
sold at from, 25 to 27 cents a tin, and the
producer reeeived 3J cents for the tomatoes
that went into the tin; peas of the best
quality sold at from 22 to 25 cents, and the
producer received 2J cents. For peaches, whiech

SENATE

sold at from 25 to 30 cents a tin, the producer
reccived 51 cents, and for pears, which sold
at from 30 to 35 cents a tin, he received 4'
cents. I think those figures are positive proof
that the producers of this country have not
been getting exorbitant prices. I suppose it
would be rather difficult to estimate the exact
cost of production in this country of basic
foodstuffs, such as dairy products, milk and
meat; but I do not sec why each province
could not work out an approximate average
and pass on the information to the consumers,
so that they would know how much more than
actual cost they were paying for their goods.
However, that still does not give us any
solution of the problem of how the tens of
thousands of people in this country who are
in the low-income brackets can be helped.
Many of these people are elderly. They
retired a few years ago on an income which
they considered at that time to be sufficient
to keep therm in comfort, though not in
luxury. Today they are having a terrible time
trying to even exist, and they have few of the
comforts of life. They are the people who
should receive first consideration at the hands
of the government today.
How can they be helped? The government today have a huge surplus. I would say
that they have almost an embarrassment of
riches. During this fiscal year they will collect from the taxpayers approximately threequarters of a billion dollars more than they
need to run the country. By the way, with
all the talk there has been in the other house
about profitecring and setting up a court of
inquiry, and al the stern warnings that have
been issued te people not te try to take all
that the traffic will bear, I should think the
Minister of Finance would be getting uneasy.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mrs. FALLIS: In these days of
increased costs, it seems to me that the only
possible justification a government can have
for taking from the taxpayers thrce-quarters
of a billion dollars more than are needed, is
that it is the intention to return a substantial
amount of that money in the form of reduced
taxes. Though all of us would welcome an
income tax cut right across the board, the
people who are suffering most would net
benefit by it. They do net earn sufficient
money, or their income is not great enough,
to bring them within the income tax brackets.
They can only be helped by the removal of
taxes which affect everyone, such, for instance,
as the 8 per cent sales tax and other taxes of
a similar nature. The removal of the 8 per
cent sales tax would help the people in the
very lowest income bracket. I have had

people say to me: "Oh, that would only
amount to a few dollars here and there". Honourable senators, I know a lot of people today
to whom S5 is a lot of money. The sales tax
is affecting everyone, and the removal of it
would bring some alleviation to those whose
need is greatest.
If any proof were needad that it is high time
that there was a woman in the Government of
Canada, I think we have it in the imposition
of the 25 per cent excise tax on electrical
appliances. When a group of men in this age
of the wsorld can solemnly declare electrical
appliances to be non-essential and clamp on a
25 per cent excise tax, I think it is time something was done about it. We in this country
have become more or less accustomed to all
kinds of taxes. and while we do net like them
we put up with them as necessary evils. I
think I have read everything the Minister of
Finance has said in explanation of this tax
on electrical appliances, and I still say it is the
msost absolutely indefensible tax that has ever
been placed on any article in Canada. I do
not say this because it affects me-it does
not affect anyone here verv much-but because
it affects one class of people in this country
whom we should be trying to help, namely, the
young people who are getting married and
trying to establish homes. They are hit hard.
Dear knows! they have trouble enough. They
look for an apartment, and they look for a
long time; then if they are finally lucky
enough to get one they go out to buy equipment and they find a 25 per cent tax on everything electrical except stoves, and there would
have been a tax on them if it had not been for
the general outcry from one end of the country
to the other. These young people are told
that electrical appliances are non-essential
goods. Is it any wonder that they come to us
and say, "Non-essential! How can you keep
bouse today without electrical appliances?" I
hope the Minister of Finance will sec his
way clear to have this completely unjust tax
removed; and if there is anyone in this chamber who should support me in this stand it is
the member fromu Vancouver who bas just been
appointed to the Senate (Rigbt Hon. Mr.
Mackenzie).
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mrs. FALLIS: In closing, I most
respectfully make an urgent plea to the
government to do something to alleviate the
distress of the lower-income people in this
country by removing not only this tax but
those other taxes which most affect their living.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.

JANUARY 29, 1948
Hon. A. K. HUGESSEN: Honourable
senators, I think my first words should be
directed to congratulating the mover and
seconder of the Address in reply to the Speech
froni the Throne, which we are now discussing.
I feel that the only thing I need say on that
point is that the information contained in
their speeches and the eloquence with which
they were delivered were only what we had
been led to expect.
In the second place, I cannot abstain from
adding my few words of welcome to the right
honourable gentleman who appeared before
us this week as our newest member and a
blushing neophyte. I can tell him that we
have admired his career in another place, and
the prominent position that he has taken in
the administration of a number of the most
important departments of the government.
That is all over now, though, and all we can
do is welcome him as the "junior junior senator from Vancouver." I do hope that if he
applies himself in his new position he will, in
course or time, attain to a knowledge of
parliamentary procedure that will permit him
to take an active part in our deliberations.
Another thing I want to do is to congratulate most heartily the honourable gentleman from Ottawa (Hon. Mr. Lambert) and
the honourable gentleman from L'Acadie
(Hon. Mr. Léger) on the most interesting and
informative speeches which they made to us
on their activities as members of the Canadian parliamentary delegation to Lake Success. I think every other member of this
house will join with me in saying to these
honourable gentlemen that we are proud of
their achievements, and that we congratulate
them on the work they did as representatives
of this chamber in that most important
assembly. I was particularly interested in the
excellent reports which they gave to us on
the present international situation as reflected
in the proceedings of the United Nations
Assembly, because the international position
is the subject on which I wish to offer a few
remarks this afternoon.
What is the present international position?
As Wendell Wilkie said, "We are living in one
world." But we have to admit that that world
is divided into two great groups: the western
democracies, on the one hand, and Soviet
Russia and her satellites, on the other. I do
not propose to discuss the chain of events
which has brought about this present deplorable state of affairs less than three years after
the unity and mutual confidence which prevailed during the period of the war. I have
my own firmly-held opinion as to the responsibility for the present condition; but that,
after all, is water -over the dam, and perhaps
there is not much use in discussing it now.

I do wish, however, to discuss a question
that is in all our minds. What are the basic
factors which underlie the relations between
Russia and the western democracies today, and
how may we expect those relations to develop
in the future? We have to admit, I think,
that two facts stare us in the face. First,
Russia refuses to co-operate with the democracies; and, second, Russia is doing her
utmost to prevent the recovery of western
Europe and to wreck the Marshall plan. These
two facts are undisputed. I will waste no
time in denouncing the Soviet government for
its attitude. Denunciation, to my mind,
serves no useful purpose. Still less do I propose to indulge in heated recrimination or
invective along lines with which we have
become so familiar in recent months through
the utterances of Mr. Molotov and Mr.
Vishinsky. After all, honourable senators,
we in this free parliament are in a different
position from Mr. Molotov and Mr. Vishinsky.
We are not under orders from our Department
of External Affairs to launch propaganda
attacks against the Soviet Union. None of us
has been told by that department what material
we must use in making those attacks, however wide of the truth such material may be.
Indeed, in our country, as in all democratic
countries, men in public life are at a distinct
disadvantage compared to Mr. Molotov and
Mr. Vishinsky. We are held personally
accountable for statements which we make in
public. If we say something that is clearly
misleading or patently untrue we shall be held
up to public ridicule and attacked in the press,
and our influence will be gone; and if we hold
elective office we shall probably be defeated
at the next election. Not so Mr. Molotov
and Mr. Vishinsky; they are in a far happier
case. They take no personal responsibility for
their statements or misstatements, however
extravagant. They are acting under orders,
and so long as they follow whatever the party
line may at the moment happen to be, all is
well, no matter how far they deviate from the
truth. In fact, the more violent and more
misleading their speeches, the more likely are
they to be lauded to the skies in Pravda or
Investia as additional hammer-blows at the
enemies of the so-called communist democracy.
May I give a couple of examples of what I
mean? In its wisdom the Soviet Embassy
at Washington sends to me every now and
again, as no doubt it does to some other
honourable senators, material whieh is usually
of a propaganda nature. The other day I
received from there a little pamphlet headed,
"Text of 'address by V. M. Molotov on the
30th anniversary of the great October socialist

SENATE

revolution, at a special session of the Moscow
Soviet, November 6, 1947." It contains a
textual report of an extremely lengthy speech
by Mr. Molotov, which every now and again
is punctuated with words in parentheses, such
as "Applause" and "Loud applause". I want
to direct attention to just two of the statements made by Mr. Molotov, as reported
in this pamphlet. Dealing with the origins
of the recent war, he said:
What did the imperialists of the West and
the East not do to -frustrate peaceful constructive labour in our country? Things were carried so far that Britain and France united with
fascist Italy and concluded the shameful Munich
agreement with Hitler Germany, in order to
spur on the German fascists to attack the Soviet
Union more speedily.
Let us consider that statement for a moment
or two. This is the first time that I, or I
think anyone else who bas read the history
of those days, bas ever been told that Britain
and France went to Munich for the purpose
of impeding the development of Russia and
encouraging Hitler to attack the Soviet. One
thing that Mr. Molotov does not mentionin fact, which ie is very careful not to mention-is the real reason the war began, namely,
the extraordinary change in policy by Soviet
Russia in August 1939, when it concluded an
agreement of friendship with Germany, thus
perrintting Germany to attack Poland without fear of consequences, an agreement to
which Mr. Molotov himself was a party on
beIalf of the Soviet government.
Let me give one other short example. Mr.
Molotov then proceeds to discuss the atomic
bomb. Honourable senators know the history
of that. We all know that the United States,
the possessor of the secret of the atomic bomb,
made an unprecedentedly generous ofier to
disclose that secret to every nation of the
international
that
world, provided only
machinery was set up to control its use so
as to prevent abuse by any country. And we
all know also that Soviet Russia bas consistently refused to accept that offer, on the
ground that international inspection would
be an infringement of her sovereignty. Those
are tie facts. Now let us hear what Mr.
Molotov bas to say. Here are his words:
Many :are outraged by the fact that the
Unitedi States and Great Britain are preventing the United Nations from adopting a final
decision banning atomic weapons ... It should
be realized that refusal to ban the atomic
weapon covers the imperialists with shame and
sets all honest people, all nations, against them.
Those are Mr. Molotov's allegations on the
present state of the controversy in connection
with the atomic bomb. I say without fear of
contradiction that they represent the most preposterous perversion there could possibly be.

·

I have no desire to compete with Mr.
Molotov in his peculiar attitude ýtowards
events; but what is interesting, and what
does concern us today is the reason that lies
behind his attitude and that of his government. What is it that makes the Soviet government refuse to co-operate with the democracies? What is it that moves the Soviet to
prevent the recovery of western Europe?
There have been a number of partial explanations of those two questions. The first is that
the Russians are naturally a suspicious and
secretive people, and that their government
is also suspicious and secretive. That, I think,
is probably true, and no doubt that characteristic has been intensified by the indubitable
fact that in the period between the two great
wars the Soviet government was treated as
a pariah and, an outcast by the governments
of the other countries of the world. Ccrtainly
the attitude of the Russian representatives at
international conferences often seems to be
one off deep-rooted and even perverse suspicion of the motives of other countries. I
an quite certain that honourable senators
who have attended international conferences
during the past two years will bear out what
I say in that regard.
This attitude of secretiveness and suspicion
on the part of the Russians is probably
intensified by the fact that the menbers of
the governing body of the Soviet hierarchy
whici rules Russia-that closely knit group of
about 'twenty men in the Kremlin known as
the Politbureau--are for the most part profoundly ignorant of any other countr- than
their own. I believe it is common knowledge
that except for 'the one occasion on which
Mr. Stalin went to Teheran for the conference with 'Mr. Roosevelt and Mr. Churchill,
he bas made no visits outside his own country.
A further reason advanced for the present
attitude of the Soviet is its jealousy of the
material wealth of the West, and a sense of
inferiority. That inferiority complex, I admit,
is sometimes much in evidence, and added to
the secretiveness, which I mentioned a
moment ago, is no doubt responsible for the
"iron curtain", that almost impenetrable veil
which the Soviet has placed between its own
people and the people of the western world.
From Russia's point of view there are two
excellent reasons for the "iron curtain". First,
she is still terribly poor and desperately ravaged by war. She has no desire to let the
people of the West see for themselves the drab
monotony in which the vast masses of Russian
If
people eke out their miserable lives.
France, Italy and Great Britain are exhausted
and impoverished by the war, as we know
they are, how much more must European

JANUARY 29, 1948
Russia be exhausted and impoverisbed after
the deliberate destruction carried out by the
armies of Hitler, with that meticulous
thoroughness of which. only the German mind
appears te be capable.
The second reason for the existence of the
"iron curtain" is apparent. The Soviets do
not dare to allow their own people to travel
to tbe West, wbere tbey may nlot only see the
better material conditions that exist, but where
they may also imbibe dangerous ideas. of
From their point of
political freedom.
view tbere have already been too, many
Kravchenkos and Gouzenkos among the
officiais whom they have sent abroad. If they
cannot prevent their own trained and indoctrinated goverument officiais from deserting
when they corne into contact with political
liberty, they would be foolish to expose their
ordinary citizens to the same temptations.
It does seem, tberefore, that envy of the West
and tbe sense of inferiority have probably
bad sorne share in producing the present
situation.
A furtber explanation put forward for the
present cQndition is the feeling of insecurity
on the part of Russia in a military sense, resulting from the fact that twice within the present
generation she bas been invaded from the west
and terribly devastated. Since the end of the
war that reason has been advanced as an
explanation of Soviet policy towards the
neighbouring countries of eastcrn Europe. The
argument that Russia must feel secure on ber
western frontiers bas been used to explain
the satellite governinents which bave been set
up by force or by fraud, and sometimes by a
judicious mixture of botb, in Poland, Hungary,
Roumania, Bulgaria and Yugoslavia, and in
the attempt to force Greece and Turkey into
the same fate.
There is no doubt in my mind that there
was a good deal of truth in that explanation.
It was an explanation which one could bave
believed two years ago, and one in wbich I,
personally, still put some confidence in March,
1946, when I spoke on -the subject in this
chamber, though even then there were sorne
aspects of the developing Soviet policy whicb
gave rise to the suspicion that its goal was
far more all-embracing than the mere desire
to secure the western frontiers.
Today the explanation no longer holds good.
Surely Russia's western frontiers are now
secure. If frontier security were the only aim,
why were attempts made to foment revolution in France and Italy, and why was the
Cominform set up three months ago to flood
the world with communist propaganda? If
frontier security were the only airm, why these
.savage attacks upon British and Amerîcan

so-called "imperialisma", and why the frenzied
attempts to defeat the Marshall plan which,
as honourable senators will recaîl, was offe-red
to aIl the countries of Europe, including Russia herself? The answer is clear, I think. No,
the explanation of frontier security is no longer
valid; nor are tbe other explanations-secretiveness and suspicion, or jealousy and an inferiority complex-by themselves valid.
The mainspring of Soviet policy today
must be looked for elsewhere. Wbat is that
mainspring? The Politbureau has gone back
to the doctrines of Karl Marx. I say "go>ne
'back", but perbaps that is not quite tbe
expression that I ougbt to use. The rulers of
Russia have always openly declared adherence
to the doctrines of Marx, but at times they
have deviated, or appeared to deviate from
the logical resulta which a strict adherence
to that doctrine would imply. What is the
basic doctrine of Karl Marx as enunciated
in the year 1848, exactly one hundred years
ago-"'the gospel according to St. Marx",
as some have been tempted to caîl it? It
is the doctrine of the social revolution, of the
violent seizure of power by the downtrodden
masses in every country. According to Marx,
capitalism is doomed, and a dictatorship of
the proletariat is inevitable.
Now, if this littie group in the Kremlin
really believe that, and there is no doubt of
their good faith when they so declare, you
will immediately get a decisive answer to the
two questions which I asked a few minutes
ago.
The first question was: Why does Russia
refuse te co-operate with the western democracies? Well, in the ligbt of the doctrine
according to Marx, why should she co-operate?
Why should you trouble yourself about
governments which are inevitably doomed,
and which will be replaced in due course by
dictatorships of the proletariat made in your
own image? It je true, of course, that our
collapse is being most unreasonably delayed.
To the true Marxist this delay is bighly
annoymng, and sometimes it causes hima to
lose hie temper. That is, perhaps, one reason
for the ill-natured exasperation which. is so

typical of Soviet propaganda today. As Mr.
Harold Nicolson observes in a recent issue of
the London Spectator:
To this doctrine of the inevitab]e must be
added their blind, eelf-pitying, boastful, cantankerous and fruetrated fury -at our obetinate
refusaI to colilapse.
The second question was: Why is Russia
doing her utmost to prevent the recovery of
western Europe and to wreck the Marshall
plan? Here again the answer is clear to the
Marxist mind. To try ta boîster up systems

cullapse is mere folly. On the contrary, the
proper course to follow is to help that collapse and to do aIl you can to bring it about;

No, I agree with the honourable senator

conflict between East and West in whicb we

That is the conflict in wbicb we are now

it is quite conceivabie that the Soviet leaders

for wcrid revolution is net yet.
There have been instances in the past in

Mr. Byrnes gives a
quotation, and you may like te know from
whence it cornes. It happens to be a quotation
frem the w'ritings of Kary Marx himself. Writing in 1853 about the Czarist Russia cf that
day and the demands that it was making upen
Turkey, Kari Marx said this:
It would have been impossible for 'Russia te
make more extensive demands upon Turkey
after ýa series cf signal victories. If the otber
powers hold firm, Russia is sure te retire in a
very decent manner.
May I repeat that last sentence:
If the other powers holti firm, Russia is sure
te retire in *a very decent manner.
Te my mind that sentence points the way
to the policy which the western powers must
foliow totiay. Wýe must holti firm. Whetber
à be in Greece, in Turkey. in Iran, in Italy or
in France. we must make it quite clear tc the
Soviets that anyv at.tempt by the communist

if n.ecessary, we will help te do the stopping.
There is, however, another thing which I
think is almost equaily important. WVe must

We sbould constantly repeat, wbat is, after ail,

Clause 37 fu-ther reads:
In case it is considered necessary the owner
will join the user in applying to parliament for
legisliation confirming and ratifying this ýagreement.
All the present bill proposes is that the
agreement be specifically approved and, in
effect, that the two railways be enabled to
carry out the provisions already agreed to.
Hon. A. L. BEAUBIEN: Does my honourable friend mean the provisions of the old
agreement or of the new agreement?
Hon. Mr. CAMPBELL: I mean that the
bill provides for the carrying out of the
provisions of this agreement as to renewal and
deternining the rental to be paid for running rights during the next twenty-one years.
I should say to honourable senators that
although the Oanadian National Railways
have join-ed in this petition, my understanding
is that when the bill goes to committee, if it
is considered necessary to refer it to a committee, they may withdraw their support.
Hon. Mr. LEGER: Has the Transport
Board taken any action with reference to this
application?
Hon. Mr. CAMPBELL: The Transport
Board bas, I understand, temporarily approved
the continuance of the running rights until
this proposed legislation is disposed of. The
twenty-one year period expired on January
13,
1948. An application was made to the Transport Board so that the Toronto, Hamilton
and Buffalo Railway would not be deprived
of its running rights, and approval was given
until its rights were determined by parliament.
I submit, bonourable members, that this
proposed irgislation was contemplated by both
parties. They entered into an agreement for
a period of twenty-one years with the riglht
of renewal for a further period of twcnty-one
years.
There is precedent for the passing of such
legislation. The Parliament of Canada, in the
face of the provisions of the Raiway Act, has
already granted to railways the right to enter
mto an agreement for a longer period than
twenty-one years. I refer to chapter 58 of the
Statutes of Canada, 1917, 7-8 George V, an
Act respecting the Toronto, Hamilton and
Buffalo Railway Company, section 1 of which
reads as follows:
Subject to the provisions of section three
hundred and sixty-four of the 'Railway Act, the
Companyi may, for any of the purposes specified
muthe said section three hundred and sixty-four,
enter into agreements or arrangements with the
Michigan Central Railroad Company, the Canada Southern Raiway Conpany, and the Grand
Trunk Railway Company of Canada, or with

any one or more of them, and any such agreements or arrangements may be for a terrm exceediug twenty-one years.
In view of that section I say that this
legisiation was contemplated by the parties,
and it is necessary to get over the general
law and to permit the continuance of joint
operation over this railway line.
Concerning the necessity of the two lines
operating over the one road, I may say that
for some years prior to 1926 there was considerable demand for duplicate rail service in
this arca. It was not felt at that time that
the Canadian National Railways were providing adequate service. Since the date of
this agreement the district bas grown and
both lines have enjoyed good business. They
are competing with each other, but neither bas
the advantage over the other except in the
matter of the service they can supply. The
Canadian National Railways can compete for
business on the same basis as the Toronto,
Hamilton and Buffalo Railway Company. I
do not know that it is for parliament to aonsider the value of these services to one party
or the other. The fact is that the two railwavs
made an agreement. It appears to be an
onerous agreement as far as the Toronto,
Hamilton and Buffalo Company is concerned,
but that company made its bargain. As far
as the Canadian National Railways are concerned the arrangement appears to have
turned ont very well. It was based somewhat
on the interest return on the capital invested
by the Canadian National Railways and upon
the interest rate on a certain bridge built by
the Dominion Government over the Welland
Canal.
I bave been given some figures which I am
told are approximately correct, showing the
capital account as it now stands. The bridge.
go-ernment-owneed, described as No. 20, is
shown at 3471.437.65; all other facilities, namely
the railway and the roadhed. $942,483.74: a
total capital account as of the end of the
year of $1.413,924.39. To the end of 1947 the
Toronto, Hamilton and Buffalo Railway Company will have paid for running rights on that
joint section a total of $1,398,952.98. In other
words. it will have paid to the Canadian
National Railways an amount equal to almost
the entire capital.
Hon. A. L. BEAUBIEN: Can the honourable sunator state the cost of maintenance?
Hon. Mr. CAMPBELL: I am about to deal
with it. That total is made up in this way:
interest on capital-that is the railway capital-8575,180; interest on Dominion Government bridge No. 20, Port Colborne, 8267,410.45;
proportion of maintenance and operating

JANIJARY 29, 194813
expenses, $556,362.53. The proportion of maintenance and operating expense seems to have
been settled on a fair basis. It provides in
some cases for 50 per cent of the entire maintenance charge, and in other cases for what
they call a wheelage rate, dependent on thec
traffic which goes over the road. The officiais
of the raiiway wiiI be abie to expiain that in
greater detail if necessary.
I submait, honourable senators, that it is not
competent for this body or parliament itsclf
to consider the value or the rentai which should
be charged in a matter of this kind. We have
here a hard and fast agreement made between
two raiiways in order to provide duplicate
services at the request of the municipalities
and the shippers in the district. The agreement provided for a ýcovenant to renew for a
period of twcnty-one years; and both jomn in
the petition.
Hon. Mr. LEGER: On that point, wiil the
honourable senator permit me to ask whether
these two companies have the power to make
an agreement for a period of time beyond the
original twenty-one years. The Railway Act,
section 154, quoted in the explanatory notes,
specifically states that such agreement shalh
flot extend beyond twenty-one years. It seems
that by the agreement which we are aýked to
ratify an agreement has been in existence for
twenty-one years. In accordance with the
section which I have cited, thai should be the
end; and it would seem that the provision for
renewal is ultra vires and void, because it
infringes the provisions of a public act.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: Is not that what this
bill is supposed to cure?
Hon. Mr. LEGER: Then you are amcnding a public act by a spýecial act.
Hon. Mr. CAMPBELL: No.
Hon. Mr. LEGER: Yes. This is a private
special act. You are seeking to amend a
public act by a speciai act, which I believe
is contrary to parliamentary practice.
Hon. Mr. CAMPBELL: I am sure that has
been donc on many occasions. No doubt the
honourable senator has come across many
cases where the question bas arisen as to
which governs, a public or generai act, or a
special set.

about it, under the iaw governing interpretation of statutes.

question that the specific set governs.

Hon. Mr. LEGER:

No. The honourabie

senator had better consuit Maxwell on the
Interpretation of ,Statutes.

Hon. Mr. CAMPBELL: Answering the
point raised, I say that the agreement itseif
is not void- by reason of the renewai clause.

Hon. Mr. LEGER: What I say is that the
specifie section which deais with >renewai is
void, 'because it is con.trry to law. While
the rcst of the bill is not void, that particuLar
section is.
Hon. Mr. CAMPBELL: The question arises
whethcr or not legisiation is necessary to
enab-le the two raiiways to now carry out the
provisions of this agreement. There is no
doubt that when they entered ýinto the agreement it was contcmpiated that they would
join in a petition to parliament to enable
them. to carry it out.
Hon. Mr. LEGER: In any case, I suppose,
the senator intends to send this bill to a
committee?
Hon. Mr. CAMPBELL: I wouid be perfcctly content to have it passer! now.

I cannot answer

Hon. A. L. BEAUBIEN: My.information
is that the C.N.R. is rcady to negotiate a

with the parties concerned.

If it is wiiling to do so, why bring ýthis legisiation before parliament? Why not let the two
parties concerner!Hon. Mr. FARRIS: -fight it'out.
Hon. A. L. BEAUPdEN: -figlit it out
before the Board of Transport Commissioners?
Hon. Mr. LEGER: Because of the twentyone yeaTs provision.
Hon. Mr. CAMPBELL: That is a proper
question to ask, but I was assuming that the
Canadian National Railways are quite willing
to negotiate a new contract. The fact is, I

suppose, that thcy wouid be willing te renegotiate the contract, but on a much more
oncrous basis. They, no doubt, would feel
that thcy werc in a very strong position, because the Toronto, Hamilton and Buffalo Rail-

way Company have lost the charter under
which they wcre entitled, to bnild the railway
themselves.

Here is a contract made in perfect good
faith between two corporations, one of which
today is publicly-owned. The rental is not
fixed for the subsequent period. If the parties
cannot agree, it is to be d.etermined by the
Board of Railway Commissioners. If the bill
is passed i.t will give the railways power to
carry out the provisions of the agreement.
That is all they are asking. Long-extended
negotiations as to how many trains are permitted to run will not be necessary, because
it is provided for under the agreement; but
they will still have to negotiate the rental,
and, failing to agree upon the rental, it will
be necessary to have it fixed in the way provided for in the agreement.
Hon. A. L. BEAUBIEN: Could they not
negotiate an agreement for twenty-one years
without coming to parliament for ratification?
Hon. Mr. CAMPBELL: They might. But if
it were interpreted as an agreement extending
beyond the twenty-one year periodHon. A. L. BEAUBIEN: No, but they
made the first agreement for twenty-one years.
According to the Railway Act they have no
power to m.ake an agreement for more than
twenty-one years. If the railway companies
had agreed, to renew the agreement which
became void on January 13, 1948, would, they
have had to come to parliament for ratification?

could net agree?
Hon. Mr. CAMPBELL: No.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: Why not disregard
the old agreement altogether and make a
new one?
Hon. Mr. CAMPBELL: I cannot answer
that question. But here is a case where two

companies-one publicly owned-have asked
parliament to grant the power necessary to
carry out a provision that was contemplated
when the original agreement was entered into.
Surely that request should not be denied.

Hon. Mr. LEGER: Yes, in violation of the

The Toronto,
Hon. Mr. CAMPBELL:
Hamilton and Buffalo Railway Company had
the right to build a road, and were induced to
abandon the undertaking upon the assurance
that here was an agreement for two periods of
twenty-one years. In order, however, that the
tern should not be fixed for the whole of that
period, it was fixed for the first twenty-one
years, with the right of renewal for a subsequent similar period, subject to revaluation
of the capital involved.
Hon. Mr. DAVIES: Is the Toronto, Hamilton and Buffalo Railway an independent
company or a subsidiary of the Canadian
Pacifie Company?
Hon. Mr. CAMPBELL: I think the Canadian Pacific Railway Company has an interest
in the Toronto, Hamilton and Buffalo Railway, but the latter is a separate, incorporated
company having its own rolling stock, operating staff and facilities, and this question involves running rights over approximately six
and one-half miles between Welland and Port
Colborne.
Hon. Mr. COPP: How many miles from
one point to another?
Hon. Mr. CAMPBELL: Six and one-half
miles. I can see from the questions asked by
honourable senators that they are greatly
interested in this measure, and that they probably would like to question railway officials
about the ownership, the capital involved and
so forth. I thought this was a simple piece of
legislation. and I have explained it as well as
I could. If the bill is given second reading, I
would ask that it be referred to the Standing
Committee on Transport and Communications.
Hon. ARTHUR ROEBUCK: Honourable
senators, I am quite satisfied that we should
give this bill second reading, but on the
distinct understanding that it be referred to a
committee where its details may be thoroughly
examined. My friend, the honourable senator
from Toronto (Hon. Mr. Campbell) seems to
have entirely overlooked the significance of

105

JANUARY 29, 1948
-the provision in Section 37, to which he
-referred. It says in part:
In case it iseconsidered necessary, the owner
-will join the user in applying to Parliament for
legiglation confirining and ratifying this agreement.
That clause was in the agreement signed by
the parties, and its implication is that this
.agreement shall fot run for more than twenty-one years unleas parliament in its wisdom
considers that it would be fair to ail parties
concerned, particuflarly the public, to allow it
to do so. Therefore I take issue with the
honourable gentleman who has explained the
measure when he says that it is not competent
for parliament te examine into the rents and
aIl other provisions of this agreement. The
honourable senator says that in the lust
twenty-one years conditions have changed considerably in the area in question. That is of
course true. If I were renting a house I
would rather have the rent settled on the
basis of conditions twenty-one years ago than
those of the present day. There may be other
inatters besides rent. As I understand it, the
owner has joined in this application because
he agreed to join in the application; but he
does flot neoessarily mean that he will flot
tell the truth about the agreement when he
appears before the committee, or that he is
flot free te say just whatever he likes, so long
as it is in good conscience, te the members of
that committee and to this house.
As I have said, 1 arn ready te see this bill
given second reading, but only on the distinct
understanding that it be sent to committee.
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: May I asic the honourable senator if the citation he juet made
is not from the Railway Act?
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: No, that was from
the agreement itelf. The Railway Act provided that such an agreement could be valid
for twenty-one years only, and an agreement
for forty-two years would have been a nullity
for the second twenty-one years. The exces
period would have been a nuhllity at that time.
Honourable senators, is it not most significant
that until the agreement was old enough to,
vote--twenty-one years old-neither party
called upon the other te, go te, parliament
with an application to ratify something which
contains a clause contrary to the set of that
time?
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: Is there sorne reason
for assuming that this legisiation should not be
here at ail, and that the whole matter should
be settled by the Railway Board of Canada?
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: I do not think so.
On ratification by parliament the raihway

companies will have to have the arrangement
approved by the Board. Nowadays, before
running rights can be given by one railway
company to another, the agreement must go
before the Railway Board for approval. Notwithstanding the general act, 1 feel quite satisfied that parliament has the power to validate
this agreement and to, make it effective for
another twenty-one years. However, 1 arn also
perfectly sure that parliament has the right to,
go into every detail and hear ail parties concerned before it takes such action. I arn glad
that the honourable gentleman from Toronto
(Hon. Mr. Campbell) is satisfied to have the
bill go to committee.

SECOND READING

Hon. G. P. CAMPBELL moved the second
reading of Bill J, an Act to incorporate
National General Insurance Company.
He said: Honourable senators, the object of
this bill ie to incorporate under federal statute
an insurance company to be known as National
General Insurance Company, and to authorize
it to carry on business in ail classes of insurance except life.
One section of the bill provides that the
head office of the company shahl be in the
city of Winnipeg, and another empowcrs the
company to acquire the National General
Insurance Company Limited, incorporated in
the year 1906 under the laws of the province
of Manitoba. The incorporators are Mr. Henry
Isaac Price and others who, I understand, have
now acquired control of the provincial company, the charter of which it is intended to
have cancelled. Section 3 of the bill provides that the capital stock of the company
shahl be $1,000,000, and the next section
requires that the sum of $250,000 ha subscribed
before the company is authorized to, commence
business.
I understand that the bill has been approved
by the Superintendent of Insurance, and if
second reading is given, I shall move that it

IMMIGRATION
MOTION

Hon. ARTHUR W. ROEBUCK m.oved:
That the Standing Committee on Immigration
and Labour be authorized and directed to examine into the Immigration Act ('R.S.C. Chapter 93 and amendments) its operation and
administration and the circumstances and conditions relating thereto including:(a) the desirability of admitting immigrants
to Canada.
(b) the type of immigrant which should be
preferred, including origin, training and other
char-acteristics.
(c) the availability of such immigrants for
admission.
(d) the facilities, resources and capacity of
Canada to absorb, employ and maintain such
immigrants, and
(e) the appropriate terms and conditions of
such admission;
And that the said committee report its findings to this house;
And that the said commi-ttee have power to
send for persons, papers and reco-rds.
He said: Honourable Senators, the resolution now before the bouse is in terms similar
to that of last year, but the situation with
regard to immigration has changed considerably, so that members of your committee of
inquiry may now feel inclined to alter the
scope and direction of their inquiry. The

107

empowering clauses are, however, broad; they
are familiar to honourable senators, and they
are sufficient for the purposes in hand.
Circumstances are, as I have said, considerably different from last year and the year
before. In previous years we have been
crusading against the cruel and senseless
policy of the closed door, and in favour of
a better-populated, more powerful and, we
hope, more prosperous Canada.
By its activities in this regard in the last
two years the Senate has assumed a leadership
in progressive opinion, and foday the Senate's
policy of selective immigration in numbers in
keeping with Ca.nada's economie conditions
and absorptive capacity has met with almost
universal acceptance, so that today our
problems are largely administrative. The door
has been opened, though not very widely. The
pathway to our portais is most carefully
guarded, and it is narrow and devious and
beset with mud holes and bouldiers. There is
still work to be dýone to improve our system,
but also there is much room for congratulation and commendation.
In the first place, the Immigration Department has been considerably expanded both in
Canada and abroad. The Ottawa office bas
been moved from the old tumble-down
Normal School to the more modern and more
commodious Woods Building, where an active
and well-trained staff is giving a vastly
service.
improved and very satisfactory
Inquiries into local situations as the result
of applications for the admission of immigrants from abroad, and the certifying of
what are called "settlement conditions," have
been attended to with reasonable dispatch,
particularly during the last year, and the
department has actually approved several
thousand more applications for adimission to
Canada than our shipping has been able to
carry.
Complaints, of course, persist in regard to
these delays and I think I can give good
reasons for them. The fault, however, does
not lie at the door of Mr. A. L. Jolliffe, our
Director of Immigration and his exceedingly
industrious staff; it is attributable to the lack
of shipping, brought about by war sinkings.
The over-all figures of the arrival of immigrants in the past year are distinctly unsatisfactory, and did I not expect a very material
improvement in the months to come I would
protest, but I have reasons for believing there
will be an improvement.
Statistics for the fiscal year ending March 31,
1947 show a grand total of only 66,990 immigrant arrivais as against 31,081 for the previous
similar period. This would indicate an increase

Four thousand five hundred young men have
been brought to Canada to work under separate contracta with individual farmers. The
experiment, honourable senatora, bas been an
outstanding success. The terni of pre-arranged
employment was neyer less than one year
and flot more than two years, and to date twothirds of these men have remained with the
farmers witb wbom they were originally
placed. 0f the remaining one-third, some were
not needed by their first employers and were
transferred ta others, at the request of al
parties. The f arm worker and his employer
are in a particuiarly intimate relationship,
affording constant opportunities for clash.
Wbere incompatibility has deveioped, the
officiai of the Department of Labour having
the authority in the matter has brought about
a shift to another employer. Oniy 280 odd
of the 4,500 men are actuaily separated from
agricultural work, neariy ail of them by permission, due ta, physical or other disabilities.
Less than 50 men out of the total have left

and these the Labour Department officiais
foilow up, urging them ta return ta agricultural work in accordance with their agreement.
I tbink one ought ta give some credit in this
regard, as that effort bas been attended with
considerable success. In thia the department
has had commendable support from the
organisations of Poliah Canadiana, the officers
of which. have urged the men ta complete their
contracta.
The Minister of Labour, the Honourable
Humphrey Mitchell, his moat efficient Deputy
Minister, Mr. Arthur ManNamara, and alI
others taking part in this work of the department are bighly pleased with the succesa of
the experiment.
The plan was inaugurated, in the firat place,

acta of that kind it bas helped ourselves as

advantagcous to the men. The Canadian macaroni industry lias applied for somnewbat simi!ar priviieges. It uxay bc that iionourabie
,,onators do not knoav tbat Caniada bias a
macaroni industî-y; but aceording to tbe
niaufactîircrs ut the produet, this country
is particulary w-cii equipped in, tbis regard
lieciu-o it produces the best wbicat in the
xvorid for this particular pîîrpo-,e. The industry
is asking the goverument ta permit the introduction of skiiied men, fromn Italy to take
part in wiîat is a more or less new industry in
tbis country. The construction industry is
asking foi- wxorkers, and aur two main railroads, the C.P.R. and the C.N.R., bave

xvork in the caming spring. As rapidiy as
,-bipping can be suppliu-d and transportationi
arranged, otber industries xviii be suppiied in
accordanc witb tîmeir proven requirements.

Obviously tbis systemn of immigration is far
superior ta any xve have employed in the past.
It is more bumanitarian; it is more likely ta
sueicceed.
But its very advantages involve
oîîe (lisadvantage xvhicb I regret. The desire

been so great, and the influence of those
engaged has been so powerful, that it lias
iiushed aside in some degree the attempt of
niany Canadian citizens ta, bring relatives to
tbis country. As a consequence, after txvo and
a balf years, althougbi applications have been
nunîous, only a fexv thousand people of this
categoi-y bave actually landed in Canada.
I bave spoken on a aumber of oecasions of
the desirability of immigrants of this class. I
have been moyed by the liumanitarian appeal
of o Canadian citizen's desire ta bring a son, n

lias ta a considerable degree retarded the
movement of relatives ta Canada; I regret
that a large number of these people still
romain ta ho moved, and I submnit, thmot the
government should give themn a priority and
thot efforts ho stepped up in their beliaîf. 1
think the time lias nearly arriî-cd, if it bias nlot
arriî-ed alreadv. for the w ide(ning of tho.se
classes of relatives so as ta include cousins and
nepbews. Cousins and nepliewxs, particularly
in European settioments, are fmequently elosely
bound into families.
There is just ane more comment that I
should like ta make, and it is with respect ta
the Act itself. As honourable gentlemen wili
recolleet, the Immigration Act, so-called, was
devised cbiefly for the purpose of putting
people out and keeping themn out, and of not
bringinýg themn in. In lino with that general
psychology are the provisions with regard ta
deportation. There is in the Act a long list
of what are described as "prohibited and

FEBRUARY 3, 1948
undesirable classes." Just as an example, there
is a ciass which includes those who have
"constitutionai psychopathie inferiority". Wliat
that means, 1 do flot know; but people having
"constitutional psychopathie inferiority are
among the prohlibited classes.
An Hon. SENATOR: Rightly so.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: Somebody lias said
"rightiy so". Perhaps that cornes from a
doctor. . He may know what that means; I
do flot. I do say that in that long list are a
number of descriptions which are ill-defined
and expressed in most generai terma. It is ail
riglit for legislators, without the victirns
present, to make general definitions of this
type. However, it is the experience of courts
of law and goverilment officiais that general
rules applied in specific cases frequently prove
liarsh and cruel, and sometimes they have
assumed the righit, to quote tlie ancient courts
of England, to "moderate the rigours of the
Iaw."
The Act states that persons coming within
the broad definitions of prohibited and undesirable classes shall not lie allowed to enter
or to remain in Canada, unless they are Canadian citizens or have acquired Canadian
domicile.
In order to acquire Canadian
domicile a person must have resided in Canada
for five years. A non-citizen or a person without domicile, when found to bie in the undesirable classes, is to bie deported; and the Act
provides that the wife and entire family of
such person shal lie deported with him.
That may 'le ail right in generai ternis; 'but
the most hard-hearted, if called upon to pass
a sentence in some cases, wouid gag at the
injustice and cruelty.
I have within my experience a case in point.
An immigrant from the Britishi Isies had
been in this country for four and one-haîf
years with bhis wife and famiiy. He was
not a Canadian citizen, but lie had establislied
himself in business in a rather 'big way. H1e
was greatiy overworked, and having Dorne
the worry and strain of a new business during
the war years, his nerves went buzzing. He
voluntarily went to a psychiatric liospital for
advice He was told flot to work so liard,
to take things a little easier, get more rest
and not worry so ranch, and lie would lie ail
right. H1e went home feeling well satisfied
with bis visit. and with the advice lie had
received and fuliy intended to follow. Everything was happy witli him until about a week
later, when lie received an invitation from
the Immigration Department in Toronto to
eall at their office together witli his wife. H1e
did su, and the official asked him if lie was
the man wlio was named as liaving been in a
5853--9

psychiatrie liospital. Wlien lie said lie was,
tlie offleer, as was bis duty under tliis Act,
handed him an order of deport-ation directed
to hirnself, bis wife and ail bis chldren. I
was ale to beat that order by proving that
tlie psychiatrie hospital was not the type of
liospital indicated liy the Act. The officiais
of the Department of Immigration so ruled
in order to get around that situation and
others like it. But note the point. Had
tlie psychiatrie liospital been one of those
institutions indicated liy the Act, the man
and bis faxnily would bave been deported.
The order would of course lie subi ect to appeai
to the minister; but in strict reading the Act
does not give the minister any discretion.
The appeal would lie on a question of fact
and fact oniy.
Sucesasive ministers of immigration, aided
by successive senior officials, bave insisted
upon infusing into the Act a certain amount
of burnanity and commun sense. They get
around the Act. Tbey pass and support orders
maccordance witli the Act, and then negiect
to enforce thern. That is not satisfactory.
I arn not at present saying that any clause of
the Act sliould lie changed or that the list
of undesirable and prohibited classes shouid
lie revised, aIthougli I feel that that is something that might weli lie studied by the coinrnittee, with a view to advising the minister
in a modemn revision of the Act.
For these reasons, I cornrend to the
favourable consideration of my fellow senators the resolution which I bave had the
lionour to move.
Hon. THOMAS VIEN: Honourable senators, I amn sure we ail feel deepiy grateful to
the lionourable gentleman from TorontoTrinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuek) for his very
able presentation of this important question.
I arn among those who.admire and envy lis
wonderful command of the King's Engliali.
Witb mucli of wliat the honourable gentleman lias said 1 agree, but a few of bis staternents I think would hear investigation and
sliould at Ieast lie cliallenged. I agree with
him that Canada is a vast, young and midi
country, capable of sustaining a mucli larger
population than we bave at present, but it
seems to me that bis criticisma of the highly
selective immigration policy that the govemfiment bas adopted is not aitogether well
founded. He depiores the fact that the government did not throw our gates wide open
after the conclusion of World War II and provide facilities for liringing to this country by
the hundreds of tliousands a&R
who wished to
corne. I think that lie lias not attacbed enougli
importance to the fact that when the war was
over we lad to provide first for the repatria-

SENATE

tion of our returning soldiers, sailors and airmen. H1e has failed to point out that millions
of Canadian men and womnen who were withdrawn from their ordinary occupations and
engaged in war work hadl to he re-established
in civil life. He has neglected to say that nlot
aIl the displaced persons in Europe would
make desirable immigrants to this country.
As honoura;bie senators know, various other
countries which threw their gates wide open
in the last century are now trying to cope
with problems created. 'by the lack of selective
immigration. Their insane asylums and hospitals are fuît of people physically or mentally unsound and incapable of making a
proper contribution to the development of
any country.
No doubt ail of us wvould welcome an influx
of physically and mentally sound people who
were willing and able to make a good contribution to -the development of the Canadian
nation. But we have to be careful. Up to a
few months ago tihere had n-ot been time to
establisb in the countries of continental
Europe proper agencies for inspecting applicants in ordcr to dûtermine whether they
would make desirable immigrants.
Therefore 1 cannot join my honourable
friend in bis criticism of the immigration
policy adopted by the Canadian government
since the cessation of hostilities. I tbink the
goveriment bas demonstrated wisdom in taking timýe to repatria-te our war veterans and
re-establi.gb our war industry workers, and in
waiting until conditions in Europe make it
possible for the Immigration Department to
set up agencies on the continent for rondueting the usual precautionary investigation of
applicants.
The bonourable gentleman bas mentioned
a few instances of distress caused to people
who came to Canada witbout authorizaýtion
and had te be sent back to their countries of
origin. We sympathize witb these people, but
sueh cases would bave been much more numcrous had we -permitted -the~indiseriminate
entry of ahl wbo were eager to come to our
shores.
I agree with that part of t-he bonourable
gentleman's speech wherein hae stressed the
urgency of adding to our immigration facilities
in Europe. I also agree with his remarks as
to the need of more shipping space for bringing in immigrants--desirable immigrantswbo, on the farms, in the mines, and in forestry
and other industries, would make a valuable
contribution to the upbuilding of Canada.
I believe that we must continue precautionary measures to avoid future regret for a
wide-open-door policy. Should, sucb a policy
bc adopted we would come face to face with

the samne problems which in the past have
confronteci other countries. We must consider
also that if Canada opens the door wide to
immigrants, many Canadians will themselves
become displaced persons in. their own country.
I tbink the bonourable gentleman, from Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck) and aIl
other honourable senators will understand
wbat I mean. In many other countries many
of the deep political and social difficulties
have resulted from a lack of precautions sucb
as those I have ad.vocated.
Hon. Mr. H-ORNER: May
honouraýble senator a question?

I

ask

the

Hon. Mr. VIE--,: ýCertainly.
Hon. Mr. HORNER: My honourable friend
bias said that many other countries have made
a mistakze in allowing immigration witbout
proper selection. May I ask him to tall me
wvbat countries hie refers to?
Hon. Mr. VIEN: If my honourable friend
will study the conditions of tbe world lie wiil
readily know what 1 mean.
Hlon. Mr. HORNER: But I do flot know
what is meant.
Hon. Mr. VIEN: I believe it would be
unwise to single out any particular country,
l)ut if my bonourable friend cares to stand
up and challenige my statements, I am willing
to go into tbe Standing Committea on
Immigration of this bouse and carry the
investigation further.
I imay inform my
bonourable fricnd'-tbougb I am sure ie bias
tbe information-that. the United States of
Amerîca is confronted today witb tbe difficulty
of accommodating people wb-o are flot, sound.
and are incapable of earning tbeir living. If
my friend will take the trouble to read the
medicaýl reviews of that country hie will find
my statement fulýly substantiated.
Honourable senators, I am sorry that, speaking extemporaneously, I cannot do justice to
this very important subi ect. particularly
following the fine address that we bave listened
to from the bonourabla senator from TorontoTrinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck).
Howevar, I
tbougbt it was my duty to place on record
a few of the reservations on this suhject wbich
1 bave in mind.
I should like to see our immigration regulations contribute towards the reunitîng of
families. I agree with what my honourable
friend bas so aptly said, that when some members of a family who have made a success of
their undertakings in~ this country have a
father, mother, brother or sister who are
victims of war conditions in Europe we
should, on humanýitarian and compassionate

FEBRUARY 3, 1948
grounds, and in the general interest of our
immigration policy, lend every effort to reunite
the famiiy. My experience is, and 1 arn sure
the honourable senator will find it is the fact,
that except in somne cases where it was flot
feasible the fun darntal principle of Canada's
immigration policy bas been along those
general uines.
I believe that our facilities in Europe should
be extended to assist the influx of desirabie
citizens. That bas been doue in sorne cases.
Honourable senators are familiar with the
work of Mr. Dionne of Beauce. Hundreds of
immigrants and displaced persans have been
sent to work in forestry and in our mining
industries.
Two or three days ago in Montreal I had a
discussion with the president of a large mining
enterprise who told me that the scarcity of
labour in the mines in northern Ontario and
northern Quebec had been relieved by displaced persans brought to this country and
sent to the mining areas. I agree entirely
that men are needed on the farrns, in the
forests, on the railways and elsewhere; but
this need is being met gradually and witb
caution.
Aithougli I arn in favour of more extensive
immigration and a greater population to help
build up Canada, I believe that if we go
slowly and prudently we will be hetter off
than if we open wide the door and indiscriminateiy admit ail those who would like to
corne to Canada. On the whoie, I believe that
the governrnent has been wise in its policy,
and should be commended for it.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: Honourable senators, may I as a matter of privilege, and witli
the consent of my honourable friend, thank
hlm for the very kind remarks lie bas made,
and say that I ar n ot conscious of having
criticized the poiicy of the governrnent; rather,
I have commended it. It would be unfortunate
if -the opposite impression were to be conveyed.
Strangely, everything I advocated lias met
with commendation frorn my honourahie
friend from De Lorirnier (Hon. Mr. Vien).
I did not propose indiscriminate immigration
or a wide-open-door policy in that sense, nor
have I recornmended the bringing of people
here by the hundreds of thousânds without
proper exarnination. My honourable friend
cannot find that suggestion ini my rernarks,
and I hope he will accept rny correction. I
did criticize transportation facilities.
Hon. Mr. VIEN: I shall certainly accept
any statement of the honourabie senator, if
I have misinterpreted in his speech.

I understood that hie wanted the officiais of
the departrnent cailed before a committee

policy. If I have misconstrued my honourabefriend's rernarks, I certainiy accept the correction.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Honourable senators, whilelistening to the remarks of rny honourabiefriends I was reminded of the days when theHonourable Mr. Meighen and the HonourabieMr. Dandurand were the two leaders in thishouse, and taiked three or four tirnes eacli on.

friends that they hire a hall to debate thequestion.
Hon. Mr. VIEN: I rise to a question of

honourable gentleman are caiied for.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I arn entitied to speak oný
a point of order.
Hon. MT. VIEN: I want to state rny question of privilege.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I have already raised a
point of order. The honýourabie gentleman bas
not the riglit ta say anything in answer. I ean
speak on the motion; that is ail I was doing.
Hon. Mr. VIEN: I have raised a question
of priviiege. The honourabie gentleman bas
stated that the honourabie senators who have
spoken shouid hîre a hall to discuss the subj1ect. I say that that rernark is absolutely
unwarranted, because the subject whici lia&
been discussed is a rnost important one, and
both the honourable senator frorn TorontoTrinity (Ho>n. Mr. Roebuck> and I have tried
to make a contribution to the debate. The
rernark of the honourable leader of the opposition is most unbecorning.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: I subrnit that I
have a perfect right to rise ta a question, of
privilege.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: The honourable senator
lias no such riglit. I forgive himi this timie;
but I shahl not allow hurn to do it again.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: The honourable
senator frorn Toronto,-Trinâty (Hon. iMr.
Roebuck) lias spoken, and the honourable
senator from De Lorîrnier (-Hon.. Mr. Vien.)
also has spoken. There may be other speakers
who would like to continue the debate. If so
they had better proceed now.
Hon. R. B. BORNER: I should like toa
say a few words ini repiy to the hoiiourable
senator from D)e Lorimier. (Hon. M'r. Vien).
There is no doubt in rny mind that the
United States lias becorne a great country

becauise, during n long period, she accepted
people who by reason of great difficulties in
their own couintries wished to migrate. I wish
to say also that in proportion te her population she bas net had any greater trouble than

SPEECH FROM THE THRONE
ADDRESS

IN REPLY

The Senate resumed fromn Thursday, January 29, the consideration of His Excellency the
Governor General's speech at the opening of
the session, and the motion of Hon. Mr.
Ferland for an address in reply thereto.
Hon. A. L. BEAUBIEN: Honourable senators, when I adjourned the debate last Thursday 1 did s0 as a good Whip, thinking that
probably seme honourabie senators would wish
te continue the debate. I do net wish te take
part ia the debate myself, and as far as I have
been able te find eut, nobody else does, so I
suggest that the motion of the honourable
senator from Shawinigan (Hon. Mr. iFeriand)
be now put te the vote.
Honourable
Hon. GUSTAVE LAÇASSE:
senators, apparently the Whip has net gene
the rounds sufficiently te find eut if any
senator intended te speak. Had he asked me,
I would have notified hima that I wished te do
se. I amn net prepared te continue the debate
tonight, but I hope it wili net go by defauit
et this particular time. I intend te give my
reasons why it should net, and te say at once
wliat I had intended te say at the conclusion
of my general remarks.
In the first place, te use plain language,
sometimes we rue short of materiai for discussion. I think ail agree te that. Ia fact, I
remember a session when a committee was
organized te select subi ects for discussion in
this chamber, partly for the reason I have
mentioned, partiy for other reasons.
Second-and I offer this as a suggestionwe should adopt the practice of continuing
over a few weeks the discussion on the Address
in reply te the Speech front the Throne, se
thiat any honourable senator who wishes te
discuas some matter la this chamber can do se
without geing through the proceas of giving
notice of his intentions two days in advance.
If we took that course we would aiways have,

so to, speak, material on the sheif; the discussion could be guided in accordance with
the -events of the day, and there would be a
continuious reserve of material.
To these reasons I add a third one, namely,
that this particular debate is the only one
which gives us the opportunity of discussing
any subject et wvill. In another place they
have an additional opportunity of doing so
during the discussion of the budget. Here, I
have been repeatedly told, we have no right
to go very far in the financial field.
1 have offered these thiree reasons for
allowing the debate go on until both Whips
are convinceil thet nobody else wants te
speak, when the debate would automatically
ail 1 wishi to say
tcerminate. That is about to add a few words
this evcniing, but 1 intend
to the discussion of the subjeet of the Address.
In 'moving the adjourrement, I say plainly
what my honourable friend fromn TorontoTrinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck) forgot te say
a while ago, wlîen hie rose to his feet for the
second time, namnely: "I do flot intend to
close the debate."
Hon. A. L. BEAUBIEN: Before the motion
is put, I should like to add a word of ex~planation. As far as I personally amn concerneti, and 1 arn sure 1 Cen speak for everybodY. t here is no wvish te curtail the debete

cvening- were net made with any idea of

qenator frein Essex (Hon. Mr. Lacasse) wants
te m.rke a second s.peech on the Address, I
have ne objection.
Hon. Mr. LAÇASSE: There is ne question
of my ýmaking a second speech. Yen have
made three yoursolf alr-cady.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: If the honourable senator front Essex (Hon. Mr. Lacasse)
wishes te speak at a later date, I will accept
his motion, although it would have been
wiser for him te bave moved the adjournment
of the debate without making a speech,

On the Orders af the Day:
Han. Mr. ROBERTSON: Befare the Orders
of the Day are proceeded with, I shau]d like
ta infarmi honourable senatars that it is my
intentian ta suggest that the Senate sit next
week and the week after. XVhat aur course
will be then will depend entirely on the disposition made af whatever legisiatian may
have came befare us in the meantîme. As I
have said before, 1 am anxions that the Senate
do everytbing it can ta expedite the business
ai parliament, but it is not my intention ta
suggest that the Senate should sit unless it
is able ta discharge same useful purpose by so
doing.

Hon. W. A. BUCHANAN: Honaurable
senatars, t.his bill makes two relatively minar
changes in tihe Narthwest Territaries Act. The
first would give the Comimissioner ai the
Northwest, Terri-tories in Caunicil the power
ta make ordinances respecting the preservation oi gamne. At present this can onhy be
dane by the Gavernar in Council, under the

Northwret Game Act. The intention ai the
bill is ta repeal the Northwest Game Act and
ta permit a more tanvenient and speedy
procedure ta be folhowed for the reguhation ai

game presgervatian in the territaries.
The second change is cantained in section
2 of the bill. In a case which arase recently
in the Northwest Territories, an appeal fram
the decision ai a stipendiary magistrate ta the

Appelhate Division ai thbe Supreme Court of
Alberta was ruled aut on the grounds that
the appeal did nat lie with the Alberta court.
The prapased amendment establishes the
Appehiate Division ai the Supreme Court ai
Alberta as the court ai appeal irom decisians
ai a stipendiary magistrate ai the Northwest
Territaries in civil matters, just as, under the
Yukan Act, an appeal fram a stipendiary
magistrate in the Yukon lies ta the Caurt af

Appeal ai British Columbia.
These are the only provisions in the 'bill.
The mation was agreed ta, and the bill was

examrination of each individua! case.

Honourable senators will recail that under
the Act cishonourably discharged men do not
qualify 'for the various veterans' grants. It
will be appreciated that many cases have
arisen in which there were extenuating circumstances and, in which a rigorous application of
military law m.ay have rendered an injustice.
The purpose of the boardL of review has been
to consider individual cases on their merits.
The volume of work of this board bas fallen
off to about one-fifth of its peak of a year
and a haîf ago, and it is expected that within
the coming year it will be possible for a
single reviewing officer to handie the remaining cases. The bill simply enahies the Minister
of Veterans Affairs to make the change, with
the approval of the Governor in Council.

NATIONAL RAILWAYS AUDITORS BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. WISHART
McL. ROBERTSON
moved the second reading of Bill 1, an Act
respecting the appointment of auditors for
National Railways.
He said: Honourable senators, this is the
usual bill which cornes before the Senate every
year providing for the appointment of auditors for the National Railways. For twentytwo years, with the one exception of the year
1935, when ýanother firm, was given the business, the firm of George A. Touche and Company of Montreal and Toronto bas carried
out this audit. There are many advantages
in h.aving one firrn specialize in this work. A
continuous audit in carried out in the railway
field by a staff -of fifty, with assistance from
United States branches.
Last session the suggestion was made that
this work could be carried out to advantage
by the Auditor General's department. The
ininister, speaking in reply to the suggestion,
said that in his opinion such an arrangement
would not be feasible, because it would require
nome time for the Auditor General's department to build up the neeessary staff, and that
no material saving would be effected.
Hon. Mr. EULER: Honourable senators,
may I ask what remuneration is paid ta
Touche and Company for these services?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I have net the
exact figure available, but I think it is about
$50,000 a year.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Honourable members, I
amn in entire accord wîth the bill except for
the statement contained in it that the firm of
George A. Touche and Company in of Montreal and Toronto. One of the partners lives
in Winnipeg and conducts an important audit
there. I know the firm does a fine job.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Honourable senators, -1 had not intended ta ask that the bill
be referred ta committee, but in view of the
point raised by my honourable friend opposite,
perhaps it should be referred ta the Standing
Committee on Banking and Commerce for the
addition of the words "and Winnipeg"
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. HAIG: I will flot press my
amendment.
The motion was agreed ta, and the bill was

PELAGIC SEALING (PROVISIONAL
AGREEMENT) BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. WISHART McL. ROBERTSON
moved the second reading of Bill L, an Act
respecting the provisional Fur Seal Agreement
between Canada and the United States of
America.
11e said: Honourable senators, I have asked
the honourable senator from. Cariboo (Hon.
Mr. Turgeon) ta explamn this bill.
Hon. J. G. TURGEON: Honourable senators, I appreciate the request of the honourable
the leader of the government that I should
explain this bill.
The intention of the proposed legîsiation is
very clearly defined in the explanatory note
which appears opposite page 1 of the bill, and
which reads as follows:
The purpose of the bill is to provide the
necessary legisiation te carry eut Ganada's
obligations under the provisional Four Seal
Agreement made between Canada and the United
States of America. The agreement in included
as Sehedule A to the bill.
Following the text of the bill is the agreement which has heen entered into between
Canada and the United States.
It seems ta me, honourable senators, that a
consideration of the whole question of fur
sealing during the last thirty-five years is, first
of ail, of extreme historical interest and significance, and secondly, indicates possibly, what
can be done through proper relations, internationalîy and domnestically, within different
spheres such as, in Canada, «territorial fields
or industrial relations. Naturally, anyone who
cornes from, British Columbia is deeply interested in pelagic fur sealing. In the closing
years of the last century the Victoria Sealing
Company exclusively, I understand, no far as
Canada is concerned, carried on fur sealing
Nationals of other coun-tries
operations.
operated in much the same way. The seal
herd, which previaus ta 1911 was estimated at
4,000,000, bad been reduced te less than
200,000 by the time the first international
agreement was made in 1911. In that year,
Canada, acting through the United Kîngdom,
entered into a sealing convention with the
United States, Russia and Japan. Japan abrogated that convention by notice in October,
1940, and the convention ended in October,
1941, shortly before Japan entered the hast
world war.

SENATE

The waters covered in the present agreement
between Canada and the United States are
defined in article I of the agreement, as follows:
. . . all waters of the Bering Sea and the Pacifie

Ocean, north of the thirtieth parallel of north
latitude and east of the one hundred and
eightiethi meridian.
In the description of the waters covered in
the original convention between the four
powers:
"convention waters" neans the waters within
such part of the Pacifie Ocean as is north of the
thirticth parallel of north latitude. including
the seas of Bering, Kamchatka, Okhotsk. and
Japan.
Under the old convention, in order to stop
Canadians from carrying on fur sealing in the
ocean at large, Canada was given 15 per cent
of the annual receipts of skins and value of
skins taken at the Pribilof Islands. Other
nations were given similar shares, ranging
from 10 to 20 per cent, the idea being simply
to stop the continuous slaughter of seals. As
a result of these measures, between 1911 and
1947 the seal herd bas increased to nearly
4,000,000, or to be exact, 3,600,000. Under the
agreement between Canada and the United
States the United States gives to Canada
each year 20 per cent of the total receipts.
Hon. Mr. EULER: How do they count the
seals? How do they know when there are
4,000,000 Do they have a census?

Hon. Mr. TURGEON: I do not know
whether they adopt our system of a decennial
census or not, but the figures in the official
documents are fairly exact. For instance in
glancing through the documents I notice that
they allude in one case to the number as being
216,000, and in another case, referring to 1947,
they state that the total has increased from
a low of under 200,000 to 3,600,000. The
Pribilof Islands seals, except for about three
months from May to July or August, when
they are on land, are scouting in the high seas.
They leave the Pribilof Islands, which, as
honourable senators know, are located in the
Bering Sea, and swim eastward and southward,
skirting the coasts of Alaska and Canada,
going down to about the thirtieth degree north
latitude. They then go back again, remaining
in that part of the Pacifie Ocean which is east
of the one hundred and eightieth meridian.
As a result of the new agreement Canadain consideration of prohibiting any Canadian
national or inhabitant from hunting, chasing
or killing seals on the high seas-is given 20
per cent of the total take of the United States
from the Pribilof Islands herd. Unfortunately,
the agreement is now confined to Canada and

the United States instead of being between
four parties, as was the case during the previous thirty years.
I do not intend to go into further detail, but
if anybody so wishes, the leader of the government will move that the bill be referred to
the Committee on Banking and Commerce.
The whole study is a very interesting one.
The main feature of the agreement is that the
Bering Sea and the north Pacifie Ocean east of
the one hundred and eightieth meridian, are
prohibited waters so far as the catching of
seals by Canadians and citizens of the United
States is concerned. Canada undertakes that
she will give to the United States 20 per cent
of any scals that are captured on Canadian
land. As a matter of fact, speaking broadly,
no seals are captured on Canadian territory,
so at no time has Canada had to give any
percentage of her catch to the United States.
On the other hand, she receives 20 per cent of
the total catch of the United States herds on
the Pribilof Islands as compensation for prohibiting sealing by Canadians on the high
seas in the areas indicated.
Apart from the historie significance of the
conservation measures with respect to pelagie
sealing which have resulted from past treaties
and the one just made, this agreement is in
itself a token of what can be done.
As I pointed out before, this particular
agreement now covers only two countries, but
it shows what can be done by groups of people,
whether they are speaking to one another
internationally as sovereign states, domestically as provinces, or in the field of industrial
relations as, say, employers and labour.
In British Columbia and other parts of
Canada there has been a great deal of talk
about forest conservation. Today, due to some
extent to the customs of the past, there is
a dearth of oil. We have in Canada many
areas where mineral deposits are known to be
present, but where no development has taken
place. In 1911 the fur seal industry was drifting to absolute ruin, and it was revived purely
as a result of the collective action of four
nations. and it is now intended that it be
maintained by the collective action of Canada
and the United States.
In supporting the motion of the honourable
leader of the government that this bill be
given second reading, I just wish to say to
honourable senators that what has been accomplished already by international co-operation
may be a token of what can be accomplished
in the future.
The motion was agreed to and the bill was
read a second time.

REFER1tED TO COMMITT1EE

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON moved that the
bill be referred to the Standing Committee
on Natural Resources.
The motion was agreed to.
PR1 VATE BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. THOMAS VIEN moved the second
reading of Bill M, an Act respecting the Trust
and Loan Company of Canada.
H1e said: Honourable senators, the Trust
and Loan Company of Canada was incorporated more than one hundred years ago, its
first incorporation being under the name of
the Trust and Loan Company of Upper
Canada, by Act 7 Victoria, Chapter 63. With
leave of the Senate I should like to place on
Hansard a short historical sumrmary of the
incorporation of the company. This witl provide the members of tbe Standing Committee
on Banking and Commerce, to which I shal
move that the bill be referred, with a fuît
background of its corporate powers.
'Under this bill the company, which bas
more capital than it can use for the time
being, proposes to reduce its capital stock.
There is one feature of the bill which I
sbould like to iay blefore this honourable
bouse. The company in its balance sheet n'ow
carnies in a forfeited share account an amount
of £27,796, being capital formerty paid up on
33,840 shares of £2 each forfeited for nonpayment of cails, whicb shares, subsequent, to
1936, are represented by 33,840 unissued preference shares of £1 each and 33840 unissued
ordinary shares of £1 each. Under the plan
these are to be cancetted, and the £27,796
formerly paid up t.hereon is to be transferred
to a new account, the capital reserve account.
The 'bistory of these forfeited shares is as
follows. In 1939 two of the ordinary shareholýders of the company went into 'bankruptcy
ini Englan-d and, according to the laws of that
country, by notices to the eornpany dated,
respectively, August 25, 1939, and January 29,
1943, their trustees in bankruptcy disciaimed
tbe shares held by these bankrupts, and on
which shares only twýo shillings andb sixpence
bad been paid. The trustees in bankruptcy
were entitled to do this by 'the British
Bankruptcy Act of 1914. and the effeet of
doing this was to discharge the trustee andl
release the 'bankru'pts and their property from
tiabitity in respect of the disclaimed property.

The London Stock Exchange objected to
this forfeiture on the ground that the~ diretors
bad no pow'er to forfeit shares on wbich there
5853-10

119

was no default in payment of catis. Thus
there arose this anomelous situation, 'that the
trustees in bankruptcy disclaimed any further
responsibiiity with respect to the uncalled portion of these shares; and yet, notwitbstanding
entertain any
that refusai of the trustees Vbo
responsibility for future ýcails on these shares,
the company, under the regulations of the
London Stock Exchange, coutd not regard
themn as having been forfeited. Therefore, on
August 1,1944, the ýcompany's directors passed
a resolution stating that for the purposes of
the cornpany's 'balance sheet these shares
should not be regarded as 'having been forfeited, 'but that it be indicated on the balance
sheet that these 6,600 shares had been disclaimed by trustees i 'bankruptcy.
This memorandum, which I would ask to
have placed on Hansard, will make fuit particulars available to bonourable members of
the Standing Committee on Banking and
Commerce. I amn only trying to save the time
of this bouse.
The reasons for the proposed reorganization
of the company's capital are as follows: In the
first place, in so far as the disclaimed shares
and forfeited shares are concerned, it is to tidy
up and sîmplify the company's balance sheet,
and to clarify the situation arising fromn the
confliet between the English Bankruptcy Act
and the Companies Act in respect to such
companies as are listed in the London Stock
Exchange.
Secondly, in so far as the reduction of
authorized capital and the -cancellation of
uncalled liability on ordinary shares are concerned, additional capital is flot required by
the company under present -conditions. The
company in its last balance sheet dated Mardi
31, 1947, showed assets of £2,481,117, of which
£902,023 was in British securities and £223,711
in Canadian government securities. These constitute more liquid capital than the company
needs or than can be used for its purposes.
In so far as the repayment of the 5 per cent
preference capital is concernied, the preference
stockholders are largeiy in Britain. The comnpany dees flot make loans in Britain, and it 'bas
there these liquid asset investments of £902,023
which, under presenit foreign exchange control
regulations, cannot be converted into Canadian
dollars.
It may be noted that the company formerly
had substantial amounts of outstanding debentures and debenture stock-in 1939, £611,817
in debentures and £735,484 in 4 per cent debenture stock-all of wbich have been repaid.
Under the plan the company's paid-up capital will undergo a rFduction fromn £1,986,930 to

SENATE

£1,103,025. In the directors' opinion this will
be adequate for the company's purposes for
the time being.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: May I ask the honourable
When distribution
gentleman a question?
is made, in what form will it be made?
Hon. Mr. VIEN: I think I can best answer
the question of the honourable leader of the
opposition from the memorandum which I
have here. In 1936 the capital structure of the
company was revamaped. The authorized capital of £5,000,000 was converted into 2,500,000
non-cumulative 5 per cent preference shares of
£1 each convertible into preference stock, and
2,500,000 ordinary shares of £1 each.
The present authorized capital is as follows:
Issued:
à per cent non-cumulative preference stock fully paid ..........
£1l,766,160
1,76,6,160 ordinary shýares of £1
each, 2/-6 paid (including 6,600
shares disclaimed by trustees in
bankruptcy)........... .........
220,770
Uncalled liability of 17/6 per share
on such 1,76.6,160 ordinary shares
of il each ....................
1,545,30
£3,532,320
Unisýsued:

preference shares of il cach . .. £ 733,840
733,840 ordinary shares of f1 cach
73W,840
£5,000,ffl

The changes in the company's capital structure resulting from the plan, if approved,
would be as follows:
lssued:
à per cent cumulative preference
stock, f ully paid (transferýable in
nuits of 10/) after returning te
preference stockliolders 10/ in
respect of cadhil£ stock held ... L 88ý3.08-0
Ordin'ary stock, f ully paid (transf erable in, units of 2/6) after cancelling uncalled liahility of 17/6

7:00,000 ordýinary shares of £1 each
(convertible in-to ordin-ary stock
700,000
Authorized................£2,503,025

I think that answers my honourable friend's
question.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I have another question.
When the company returns these 10 shillings
for each £1 of stock, will that be turned into
Canadian currency or into pounds sterling?

Hon. Mr. VIEN: 1 cannot gîve the honourable gentleman a defin-ite answer, but my
information is that the Canadian shareholders
will be paid in Canadian monýey and the English shareholders in sterling. 1 speak subject
to correction.
The president and general
manager of the company will appear before
the committee to give further information if
required.
Hon. Mr. EUJLER: The honourable gentleman stated that a certain amoun-t of the stock
suhscribcd for had been paid up, and perhaps
he can state what that amounit is. 1 am concerned particularly, however, about the forfeited shares, or the shares that will be forfeited if this bill is passed. I understood the
senator to say that the amounit paid in on
those shares is added to the company's
reserves.
Hon. Mr. VIEN: Are you referring to the
shares of those who went into ban-kruptcy or
to the shares of the other shareholders?
Hon. Mr. EU'LER: I am referring to the
shares of those people who paid a certain
amount but could flot pay the balance. The
amount paid in, and forfeited to the company
is, I take it, a profit to the company, and
this I understand was added to the reserve
of thc reorganized company. Does that create
a surplus for the company? And if those
assets are distributed by the company to some
of the shareholders, as they might very well
be, wvill they be distributed as capital or as a
dividend which will be taxable?
Hon. Mr. VIEN: The amount in question
will flot be distributed, but will be carried as
a surplus.
Hon. rMr. EULER:
profit?

Is it regarded

as a

Hon. -Mr. VIEKN: It cannot. be rcgarded as
anythýing but a profit.
Hon. Mr. EULER: Then it should be taxable.
Hon. Mr. VIEN: We are dealing with
shares that have 'been forfeitedL in England,
and I an- quite sure, though I am net
competent to express an opinion upon it, that
the company will have to meet the income
tax authorities in 'Great Britain and settie
that question.
Honourable senators will readily appreciate
that these are shares on which the shareholders had paid the calîs te the date when
they went into hankruptcy; at that time
17 shillings andl sixpence was still callable on
each of these shares. The trustees in bank-

rIEBRUARY 4, 1948
ruptey were faced with thie problem of either
claiming the holdings and being responsible
in hehaif of the estate in bankruptcy for calls
which might be made in the future, or, in the
alternative, of abandoning what they had paid
on the shares and disclaimiing any responsibility in the future with respect to calîs that
might be made by the board of directors.
Under the British Bankruptcy Act the
trustees elected- to follow the alternative
course anid to forfeit the payments made by
the 'bankrupts in order to be relieved of
responsibility for any future calîs.
The situation created, as bas becn pointed
out by the honourable senator from Waterloo
(Hon. 'Mr. Euler), was that the amount paid
by the shareholders became capital gain for
the company. By reason of the cancellation
of the shares and the resultan-t capital gain,
the amount that had been paid had to be
carrîed into, a special account flot otherwise
provided for. That special acecount bas been
created by reason of the attitude of the London Stock 'Exchange. I hope I have made
the point clear.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: Honourable
senators, the honourable senator from De
Lorimier (Hon. 'Mr. Vien) bas asked leave
te place on Han.sardcertaininformation wbich
hie does not choose te read. Is it your wish,
honourable gentlemen, that leave be granted?
Some Hon. SENATORS: Carried!
(See appendix at end of today's procecdings.)
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Honourable members, I
agree with what the honourable senator from
De Lorimier (Hon. Mr. Vien) has said. The
only money that the honourable gentleman for
Waterloo (Hon. Mr. Euler) was concerned
about was the amount involved in these bankrupt shares.
Hon. Mr. EULER: That is aIl.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: The point that I was interested in bas been answered satisfactorily:
In western Canada, especially in Manitoba,
this company had over many years Ioaned
large amounts of money. In 1936 and 1937 the
loans did not appear very valuable, but
during the past five or six years the company
has been able to colleet substantial sums cf
money. The shareholders in my province are
anxious that the distribution be made in
Canadien funds; the payment of the money
in English currency might be disastrous for the
Canadian shareholders.
I have read the bill carefully and, speaking
pcrsonally, 1 arn quite sure there will be no
5853-101

objection to it. I have discussed. the bill with
friends of mine who are interested, and I arn
quite sure that if the money is returned to
thcm in Canadian funds they will be entirely
satisfied.
Hon. Mr. VIEN: I speak subjeet to correction, but 1 arn quite sure that will be done.
If the bill is given second reading, I propose
to move that it be referred to the Standing
Committee on Banking and Commerce, and
I shahl ask the chairman of that committee
to fix Thursday, February 12 for the. hearing of
witnesses.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was

FEBRUARY 4, 1948

APPENDIX
The Trust and Loan Company of Canada
Plan for the reorganization of the capital of the company.
1. Incorporation of the company
(a) Original statutes -The company was
origiually incorporated under the naine of
"The Trust and Loan Company of Upper
Canada" by Act 7 Vict. C.63 (9th December,
1843) of the Province of Canada, and rules and
regulations weremrade in a deed of settiement
(lst June, 1844) for carrying on and regulating
the company's affairs.
Further acts of the Legisiature of Canada
were passed later extending the powers of the
company, viz 8 Viet. C.96 (13th March, 1845),
14 Vict. C.138 (lOth August, 1850), 22 Vict.
C.132 (l6th August, 1858), 25 Vict. C.72 (Oth
June, 1862) and 45 Viet. C.111 (l7th May,
1882).
(b) Original royal charters-In addition to
these early Canadian statutes a royal charter
was granted to the company on l3th November, 1845, by which all the corporate and other
privileges, immunities and powers granted by
the Canadian Act of 1843 were conflrmed and
declared to be operative not only in Canada
but also in the United Kingdom, and it was
declared that the business of the company
might be carried on according to, the provisions of the Act, deed of settlement and
charter.
By a further royal charter dated 2Oth February, 1872, the naine of the company was
changed to "The Trust and Loan Company of
Canada" and certain modifications were made
in the provisions of the earlier royal charter
of 1845.
(c) Present governing statute-The earlier
Canadian Acts above mentioned were repealed
by the Trust and Loan Company of Canada
Act, 1910 (9-10 Ed. VII 0.168) 4th May, 1910)

which as amended is now the governing statutef or the company.
This Act has been amended to change the
capital structure of the company by the Acts2 Geo. V C.158 (l2th March, 1912), 10-11
Geo. V C.96 (llth May, 1920) and 1 Ed. VIIL
0.57 (23rd June, 1936).
(d) Present governing royal charter-By ai
further royal charter dated llth January, 1911.
it was declared that on the above mentioned
new governîng Canadian statute (9-10 Ed. VII
C.168) being put in force by proclamation the
constitution and organization of the company
was to be as prescribed by that Act in lieu of
the provisions with regard thereto contained
in the royal charters of 1845 and 1872 and
deed of settlement of 1844.
By a Canadian proclamation the governing
Canadian statute came into force on 4th
March, 1911.

of £2 each forfeited for nonpayment of. calls, which shares, subsequent to
1936, are represented by 33,840 unissued preference shares of £1 each and
33,840 unissued ordinary shares of £1 each. Under the plan these are to be
cancelled and the £27,796 formenly paid up thereon are to be -transferred to -the
capital reserve account, a new account. Thus the presently unissued authorized
733,840 preference shares and 733,840 ordinary shares will be reduced to 700,000

4. Disclaimed and forfeited shares
(a) 6,600 Ordinary shanes £1 each, 2/6 paid.
Disclaimed by bankruptcy trustees
(i) Two of the company's ordinary shareholders,
Roland Gordon Stanley Mahony, holding
100 shares Nos. 1672272 to 1672371,
Humphrey Eugene Keogh, holding 6,500
shares, Nos. 1486725 to 1488724 and
165933 to 166322,
went into bankruptcy in England and by
notices to the company respectively dated
August 25, 1939 and Januýary 29, 1943 their
trustees in bankruptcy disclaimed the shares,
on which only 2/6 had been paid, held by
these bankrupts. This the trustees in bankruptcy were entitled to do by the British
Bankruptcy Act, 1914 (4-5 Geo. V 's. 54) and
had the effect of discharging the trustee and
releasing the bankrupt and bis property from
liability in respect of the disclaimed property.
(ii) In view of these notices the coinpany's
directors on May 6, 1943 passed resolutions
that such shares be regarded as having been
forfeited on March 31, 1943. Section 20 of
company's charter (9-10 Ed. VII Chap. 168)
gives the company a hirst lien on ahl shares
for the holder's liabilities to the company
and the directors powver to forfeit such shares

6

£ 2,500,000

if the holder defaults in payment of any
amount actually due and payable to the company in respect thereof.
(iii) The London Stock Exchange objected
to this forfeiture (on the ground that the
directors had no power te forfeit shares on
which there was no default in payment of
calîs thereon) and the company's directors on
August 1, 1944 therefore passed a resolution
that for the purpozes of the company's balance
sheet the aboya shares shall fot bc regarded
as having been forfeited but that it be indicated on the balance sheet ýthat those 6,600
shýares had been di.sc1aimed by trustees in
banýkruptcy.
(b) 33,84 shares £2 each, 15/ paid forfeited
W1 These shares were held by 15 shareholders (list available with names, individual
amounits paid on caîl and share and certificate
numbers)
(ii) On -a caîl of 5/ being made on October
31, 1934, and of 2/6 on December 12, 1935, an
aggregate of £2,416 *4-1 was paid by these
shareholders, the paid up capital on these £2

(iii) As full call flot paid by these shareholders, company's directers after due notice
March 20, 1936, passed resolution pursuant to
by-iaw 1 section 32 forfeiting thesc shares.
(iv) Since forfeiture above ameunts paid
up on these shares have been shown in the
company's balance sheet in "Forfeited shares

6. Approval of plan by preference stockholders and ordinary shareholders and the
c om pa ny
(a) The plan for the reerganization cf the
capital of t'le company is con'tained in special
by-law 'A' which was submaitted- te the
preference stockholders, and the ordinary
shareholders in separate general meetings and
also te an extraordiýnary general meeting of
the company, ail held for the purpose in
London, England on August 7, 1947.
(b) The notices calling the meetings were
accompanied by an ex-planatory letter cf the
President (Rt. Hon. Lord Greenwood)l and
copy of the speciai by-law 'A' containing1 the
plan for the reorganization of the capital of
the company.
(c) At such meetings the special ýby-iaw 'A'
was sanctioncd and confirmed, by the foilowing

(Sc certificate of Price, Waterhouse & Co. August 7, 1947, who aise certified therein that
necessary quordm was at ail times present).

(d) Undýer the cempany's charter (9-10 Ed.
VII Chap. 168 Section 10) directors are
empowered to, make by-l'aws fer the purpeses
inter alia of disposaI of ferfeited shares and
preceeds thereof, decreasing share capital and
conversion cf partly paid shares into fully
paid-up shares.
Directors' action however must, be sanct.ioned. "by the sharehelders by a vote cf net
less than twe-thirds in value cf the shares cf
capital stock represented at a general meeting
cf the cempany called fer the purpose". Such
by-laws must also be "confirmed by a certificate of the Minister cf Finance (cf Canada)
under the authority cf the Treasury Beard".
(e) It. may be noted that in fact special
by-law 'A' was sanctiened and confirmed at
the three separate meetings by three-fourths
in value of the preference stock and ordinary
shares represented at each meeeting which is
the percentage required for approval of a
compromise or Arrangement between a company and ýits shareholders under the Canadian
Companies Act (section 122) had such Act
been applicable to, the company.

7. Reasons for the proposed reorganization cf
the company's capital
(a) Insofar as the disclaimed shares and
forfeited shares are concerned te tidy up and
simplify the company's balance sheet;
(b) Insofar as the reduction cf authorizcd
rapital and cancellation cf uncalled liability
on ordinary shares are cencerned, additional
capital is net required by the cempanry und-er
present conditions, viz, the company on its
last 'balance sheet at, March 31, 1947, showed
assets cf £2,481,117, cf which £902,023 were
je British Gevernment securities and £223,711
in ýCanadian Government securities whieh
constitute more iiquid capital than it needs
or than, can be used fer the cempany's
purpeses;
(c) In se far as the repayment cf 5 per
cent preference capital is concerned, the preference stockhoiders are iargeiy in Britain, the
company does not make boans there and the
company has these iiquid asset investments
in Britain cf £902,023 which under present

foreign exchange contrai regulatices cannot be
converted into Canadian dollars for use i

FEBRUJARY 4, 1948
Canada in the company's business of making
loans.
It may be noted that
I. the company formerly had substantial
amounts of outstanding debentures and
debenture stock (in 1939 £611,817.10.0 in
debentures and £735,484.0.0 in 4 per cent
debenture stock) ail of which have now been
repaid;
Il. undcr thc, plan the company's paid up
capital will undergo a reduction from
£1,986,930 to £1,103,025 and in the directors'
opinion this will be adequate for the company's purposes for the time being; and
III. the British Association of Investment
Trusts and the British Insurance Association
Investmcnt Protection Committee recommended their interested members to vote
in favour of the plan.
8. Effect of plan on thc company's creditors,
stockholders and shareholders
(a) On creditors: Last balance sheet of
company shows that liability to sundry creditors, including provision for taxes, only amount

127

eomparatively small amount of £90,047.
(of this £78,000 was British and Canadian
income tax lîability since paid).
(b) On preference stockholders: Tbey wilI
receive a cash payment of 10/ in the £1 and
will be the owners for the future of a 5 per
cent security with cumulative dividend rights.
(c) On ordinary shareholders: They will be
relieved of an uncalled liability of 17/6 on each
share held and their dividend prospects will
be improved as the result of the reduction
by 5 per cent in the amount of preference
capital ranking before tbem.

9. Business of the company
The company carrnes on the business in
Canada of lending, advancing and il'vesting
its moneys and funds, purchasing or investing
its moneys in mortgages of land and in Canadian and British publit secunities, and of
acquiring and dealing in lands, and of acting
as financial agents. In England the company's
business is purely direction and administration,
and to obtain funds for the company when
required.

average is a very sound one, and ifs application tu small industries, espe(ially industries
wlirb had no reserves wben tbe war came
along, would be mosf beneficial.
That is tbe second suggestion I offer foday;
and on botb scores I hope you will believe me
wben I say tbaf I know wbat 1 amn falking
about.
Another recommendation I wisb f0 make is
intended f0 remedy a situation cf whicb many
peuple are complaining-tbe fou bigb rate of
interest on fax arrears. A good many peuple in
Canada have failed tbrouigh nu fanît of their
own f0 nieet tbeir obligations f0 fbe government. ilere again I pray you to believe that
I knuw wbat I arn talking about. Wben misfortune bits your home, and in order f0 face
unpredictable difficulties you are called upon
f0 draw on whatever reserve you may have, if is
rnigbity bard f0 meef tbe situation and pay
8 per cent interest on your arrears. We a-Il
know tbat tbe interest wbicb most financial
institutions today cao get on their investmnents
is not more than 3ý f0 412 per cent. Here,
again, I bappen f0 kn ow wbat I arn talking
"about. One is autborized by law f0 invest
rnoney in private loans wifh a return of nîaybe
5 or 6 per cent; but the government demande
tbaf we pay f0 it, "tbrougb tbe nose', at the
rate of 8 per cent. By approving a demand of
tbis kind we are supurtiug un état usurier.
That is wbaf tbe governimenf of rny country
is doing today, and I do nof hrag about if.
I amn, indeed, asbamed tri have f0 mention if,
but une must remain faitbful f0 the trutb. I
suggest fberefore tbat a revision by way of an
interest reduef ion be considered at tbe earliest
possible moment.
AIl in aIl, 1 do nof question the soundness
of tbe principle of income fax. As f0 tbe
application of fhat prineiple 1 bave my own
reservations. I do not wisb f0 go back f0 the
Great Flood, but I think if would be well to
remind bonourable senaf ors wbat a prominent
philosopher of a bygone century fbought about
income fax. Here is wbiaf be wrote for posterity
fa read:
In whafever cify, where incurne fax existe
honiesty is penalized and crookedness rewarded.
That was said. nof by some great modern
statesman or economist, but by none other
tban the immortal Plato, aufbor of La Cité
Parjoite,-"2Tbe Perfect City". There is mucb

FEBRUARY 5, 1948

This invites me, honourable senators, to
review the disastrous results of over-prolonged heavy taxation; but I shall refrain
frorn doing so, except to say that taxes belong
'to the family of necessary evils. Nobody likes
a tax, but everyone has to pay it in one
form or another, unless he already has been
ruined by it and left without anything to
pay it with. When such is the fate of an
odd one here and there it matters little, and
we say "Too bad, but the common good must
prevail." But when more and more become
the victims of excessive taxation, and whole
communities are bankrupted, it becomes a
matter of public concern; and the more so
when this condition cpreads to the nation at
large. During the long period of economic
depression and unemployment which Canada
experienced between 1930 and 1938 we came
to know something of the calamities which
such conditions bring with them. Nobody
wants to see such a situation again. So let
us bear in mind that sky-high taxation all
around is bound, if not lowered in time, to
bring back similar and possibly many-timesworse conditions, with their cortege of destruction of credit, foreclosures, broken homes,
disrupted families, and all sorts of other
miseries, leading to a general dislocation ot
our social and economic structure, along with
a complete breakdown of moral comfort and
individual initiative. Such dangers are so
imminent, honourable senators, that voices
which carry a good deal more authority than
my own have already begged the government
to lower taxation, on the ground that a minimum of material comfort is indispensable to
the practice of Christian and social virtues.
The clamour is getting more and more
vociferous throughout the land, and no government which owes its existence to democratic
institutions can ignore it much longer. I understand that the Prime Minister himself, in a
speech lie delivered in another place a few
days ago, gave us a ray of hope that action
will be taken in the right direction. No
astute statesman could do otherwise; and I
again compliment him on his good judgment and clear understanding of the problems of the day.
In conclusion, I hope that no honourable
senator will interpret this speech of mine as
an unfair criticism of the government's policy.
I have simply endeavoured to discharge my
duty according to the noble traditions of this
honourable body, by offering what I sincerely
believe to be constructive suggestions. I am
confident that the representative of the
government in this house will convey my suggestions to the powers that be in the same

spirit of loyal co-operation as I have presented
them. Honourable senators, I thought that
now was the time and here was the place to
speak as I have spoken, and I trust that all
present share my views in that regard.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: Is the honourable
senator sure that the rate is 8 per cent on
income tax which is in arrears? I thought
it had been reduced to 5 per cent, or perhaps
4. per cent.
Hon. Mr. McINTYRE: For the information of my honourable friend, I may say that
the rate on arrears of income tax due for four
or five years is 5 per cent up to the time they
are assessed. After they are assessed, if not
paid within a certain time, the rate is raised
from 5 per cent to 8 per cent.
Hon. A. L. BEAUBIEN, (for Hon. Mr.
Farris), moved the adjournment of the debate.
The motion was agreed to.
DOMINION WATER POWER BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. WISHART McL. ROBERTSON
moved the second reading of Bill P, and Act
to amend the Dominion Power Act.
He said: Honourable senators, I have asked
the honourable senator from Medicine Hat
t
(Hon. Mr. Gershaw) · o explain this bill.
Hon. F. W. GERSHAW: Honourable senators. I must thank the leader of the government for assigning to me the task of
explaining this measure.
The object of this bill is simply to amend
the Dominion Water Power Act and to make
it clear that the Department of Mines and
Resources has the authority to develop water
power on lands belonging to the Dominion
Governiment directly in the name of the
Crown.
The officers of the Department of Mines
and Resources hold that they have such
authority, but the Department of Justice feels
there is sone doubt. Therefore, in order to
have the situation made absolutely clear, it is
proposed to amend Section 12 of the Dominion
Water Power Act by adding paragraph (p),
which provides that permission be given for
the construction, maintenance and operation
by the minister of any undertaking upon
lands of the Dominion.
The question has come up because the
Department of Mines and Resources has a
water power system under construction on
the Snare River, some ninety miles north and
west of tihe town of Yellowknife. The question does not involve the advisability of pro-

SENATE
ceeding with the workz, but of granting
authority to do the work. I have the full
particulars of this undertaking here. The project was started in 1946 as the resuit of an
Order in Council, and estimates were passed
in 1946-47 and again in 1947-48. The Order
in Council w*as worded in such a way as to
mean that parliament, had granted authority

to start this work. The pro:ject wi]1 develop
power for mining, sme]ting and other similar
plants. This short amendment was put in
just to make the situation clear.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill
wvas read the second time.
The Senate adjourned until Tuesday,

DOMINION WATER POWER BILL
THIRD READING

Hon. WISHART MeL. ROBERTSON
moved the third reading of Bill P, an Act to
amend the Dominion Water Power Act.

SENATE

Hon. Mr. LEGER: Honourable senators,
would the leader of the government be breaking confidence by telling us what water power
development the Crown bas in contemplation?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I arn not in a
position at the present time to give that information. Perhaps the honourable senator from
Medicine Hat (Hon. Mr. Gershaw), who
explained the bill, would do so.
Hon. Mr. GERSHAWýý: Honourable senators, the Department of Mines and Resources
for the past year and a baîf or two years has
been working on a plan to develop power on
the Snare river, north and somewhat west of
the town of Yellowknife, which is 800 miles
north of Edmonton and in the centre of the
rich new mining development in the Nort.hwest Territories.
TIhe cost of developing the power will ho
about $3,000,000, and the cost of distributing
it will be another $1,000,000 or so. Power will
be supplied to the Consolidated Mining and
Smelting Company, the, Giant Yellowknife
mine, the Ncgus mine and the town of Yellowknife, wbich has n population of three or four
tbousand people.
Arrangements have heen made for a return
of capital invcstment. The department has
ascertained that these mines have ore blocked
out for at least fiffeen years of processing, at
the end of xwbich the interest and principal
will ail bc returned to the government.
It is necessary that the government build
this plant, because private concernis would not
undertake so large an expenditure. The projeet was authorizcd first by order in council.
Las, ycar's estimates contained an item to
cox er the cost, and tbis reeeived the authorizatien of the House of Commons. A similar
item appears agair. in this year's estimates.
It is the view of the Department of Mines
and Resources that up to the present it bas
been operating under the authority of the
estimate put through last year, and the legal
advisers of the -department feel that it bas
a perfect right to build the plant on Dominion
Government land in the namne of the Crown.
However, as somne question has been raised
by the law officers, Ibis amendment is proposed to make the situation clear, and for the
direct purpose of deve]oping a power site on
the Snare river in that mining district.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the third lime, and passed.
PRIVATE BILL
SECOND

READING

Hon. A. W. ROEBUCK moved the second
reading of Bill K, an Act to incorporate
Peopie's Fraternal Ordýer.

Some Hon. SENATORS:

Explain.

Hon. A. W. ROEBUCK: 1 think there is
not very much to explain, honourable senators.
This bill proposes. an ordinary incorporation of
a fraternal organization, approved, I believe,
ýby the departmnent, and of course will be referred to whatever committee the leader of the
government side may determine.
Yet there is something which perbaps is
worth telling to honourable senators. A
number of years ago a group of Hungarian
Canaclians in the city of Hamilton organized
wbat was known as the CanacLian Hungarian
Mutual Benefit Federation, which for a considerable lime carried on its activities in the
Hungarian language among new Canadians of
that origin in Hamilton andi vicinity. Il was
fraternal in character as well as in its charter,
including among its activities soch things as
health education, acrobaties and plays. Later
a group of Czechoslovakians joined! tbe
society, and these were followed by a number
of Enghlish speaking people of Anglo-Saxon
origin. Thus il, became necessary to have
tbree divisions of the society-Hungarian,
Anglo-Saxon-each
andi
Czec'hoslovakian
carrying on in its respective language. In 1927
the Canadian Hungarian Mutual Benefit Fedcration was ineorporated under the laws of Ontario, and in 1934 the naine was changed to Independent Muitual Benefit Federation. 1'rom
this change the society grexv very rapidly. and
at the present time bas a membership of approximately 6,000 across Canada-one-third of
this number being women and children-and
bas developed into a family organization for
social as well as fraternal and mutual-aiti purposes and activities. The management now
feel that the time is ripe to secure dominion
incorporation. under somne such namne as the
People's Fraternal Order.
1 suggest that the bill, if given second
reading, be referrcd to the appropriate comnmittee.
Hon. Mr. CRERAR.: May 1 ask my hionourable frienýd if this is a new namne? Hither-to
this ýorganization bas not heen known as the
People's Fraternal Order.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: No.
Hon. Mr. CRERAR: It occurrs to me that
some objection might he taken to the ailembracing terni "people's", and its application Vo one ýorganization. This may flot be a

point that should be cleared up when the bill
goes to committee.

lu~

FEBRUARY 10, 1948
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: I see that there
might he objection to a namne of that character. No doubt that matter will be gone
into when the bill goes to committee. It has
been the practice to ascertain whether the
department has any objection to, a proposed

However, that will not stop the inquiry suggested by the honourable senator from

difficulties have developed in the heating systemt of the Parliament Buildings. Not only is

INTERNATIONAL WH.ALING
CONVENTION
MOTION

Hon. WISHART McL. ROBERTSON
moved:
ihat it is expedient that the Houses of Parliament do approve the International Convention for the Regul'ation of Whaling, signed at
Washington on December 2, 1M4, and that this
house do approve the same.
He said: Honourable senators, I have asked
the honourable gentleman from, Southern New
Brunswick (Hon. M.r. MeLean) to speak to
this motion.
Hon. A. N. McLEAN: Honourable senators, Canada is a party to several international
agreements and conventions regulating whaling. There was one signcd at Geneva in 1931,
and another at London in 1937. Th.e latest
convention, the one to which this resolution
relates, was signed at Washington on December 2, 1946. It is based on principles embodied
in the bondon agreement of 1937 and the protocole to that agreement signed in London on
June 24, 1938, anld November 26, 1945.
The present resolution, based on the Washington agreements, is being fully supported
by the Honourable Minister of Fisheries. He
has sent to me considerable technical detail,
which seems too long to place on Hansard, s0
I shaîl simply try to cover some of the main
The nations represented at the
points.
Washington convention, and whose delegates
signed the agreement, were: Argentina, Australia, New Zealand, Brazil, Canada, Chule,
Denmark, Frante, the Netherlands, Norway,
Peru, the 'Union oif Soviet Socialist Republics,
the United Kingdom of Great Britain and
Northern Ireland, the United States of
America and the *Union of South Africa.
It is necessary from time to time to revise
and amend these international whaling agreements, in the light of research and new scientific information. That there is greafr need for
world regulations covering the fishing of
whales is seif-evident; otherwîse these valuable mammals may in time become extinct.
There are, as we know, quite a few differen-t
varieties of whales, and the agreement en-

SENATE

deavours to prevent the over-fishing of any
species. The killing of young whales under a
certain size is absolutely prohibited. Protection is given to certain kinds of female whales,
and also to gray and right whales. Catches
are Iinîited in certain latitudes. Rules are
laid down covering factory ships and catcher
boats. Government inspectors must accompany eacn factory ship. Each of the contracting governments agrees to take appropriate
measures ta ensure the application of the
provisions ai the agreement, and to punish
infractions of these provisions by persans or
vessels operating under its jurisdiction.
A new feature which came out af the
Washington convention was the establishment
of a permanent international whaling commission, ta be composed of one representative
from eaQh af the cantracting gavernment.
The expenses af each member of the commission are ta be paid by the gavernment he
represents. The commission thus constituted
will gatber data pertaining ta the industry,
scientifie information regarding the habits and
other characteristcs af whales, and it will have
power ta amend the rules and regulations at
present embodicd in the sehedule af the agreement, and ta adopt new anes with respect ta
the conservation and utilization af whale
resaurces.
I believe that Canada should take an active
interest in the whaling industry, because her
Arctic territary is inbabited by certain species
af whales in considerable numbers.
This bouse was told the other day how,
under a conservation agreement between
Canada, the Uk)nited States and some other
cauntries, the Pacific herd ai seals had incrcased fromn 200,000 ta aver 4,000,000. Whales,
oi course, are not as numerous as seals, but
nevertheless this is an example ai what can
be accomplished under scientifie conservation
laws or agreements. The whale, as we know,
is a very valuable mammal, producing large
quantities af ail and whale-bane, and in these
days, wben ails and fats are sa scarce, refined
whale-oil can make a very valuable contribution ta the warld's supply ai edible ails.
Uniortunately, Canada has no whaling ficet
in operatian at the present time, but it is
boped that she will have one in the near
future.
During the recent war, whaling fleets were
practically aut ai business; but they are being
reorganized, and today England and Narway
have whbàling fleets which operate chiefiy in
the Antarctic. Japan is said ta be getting
hier whaling ficet ready again, and Newfoundland bas a fleet that carnies on in the Arctic.
Over the years whaling bas praved profitable
ta the nations which have engaged in it.

Sbould Canada enter the industry, it would
give employment ta quite a large number oi
Canadians.
As stated, the conierence which met at
Washington set up a commission witb autbority
ta keep in close toucb with the whaling industry in aIl tbe countries wbere it is engaged
in, and ta carry out stuch purposes af tbe convention as conservation, dcvelopirient, and the
optimumin utilization ai tbe whale resaurces,
bas«d on scientific findings.
The commission thus set up may fromn time
ta time make recommendations ta. any or ahl
contracting governments on any matters wbich
relate ta wbales or whaling or to the abjects
and purposes af the convention.
Wben at least six signatory gavernments,
încluding those ai tbe Netherlands, Norway,
the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, the
Kingdom of Great Britain and
Unitedl
Nortbern Ireland, and tbe United States ai
America, have deposited instruments oi ratification, tbis convention will came into farce
wvîth respect ta those gavernments. It will
also be binding on any governmrent which
subsequently ratifies or adberes ta the convention, and will become effective on the
date of tbe deposit ai the instrument ai
ratification or an receipt ai notification ai
adherence. Any contracting gaverament may
xitbdraw iromn this convention on June 30
ai any year by giving notice on or before
January 1 of tbat year.
Hon. THO MAS VIEN: Honourable senators, I am in favour ai the motion ta approve
the agreement entered into with respect ta
the whaling industry. From time immemorial
whaling has been a subject ai interest. We
could trace it back ta Jonah, but we need
hardly go that iar. It can be said, however,
that during the past twa or thrce centuries
whaling has been ai considerable interest ta
many countries ai the world, and ta some of
themn a source ai great wealth. I regret that
in the past Canada bas nat scen fit ta enter
into it.
Before the recent war, by reasan ai competition by Germany and Japan, a condition arase
in the whaling industry which made it necessary for civilized countries ta enter into an
agreement ta pratect this resource and prevent
the destruction ai whales. The annual catch
had been reduced ta 16,000, and an effort was
made ta prevent whale fishing during the
lactation period, in certain months ai the year.
The agreement was adhered ta by Germany
and Japan until about 1936 or 1937, when
Japan withdrew iroma it, with the resuit that
there was an appalling destruction ai whales
throughaut the world. Therefore, ini order

FEBRUARY 12, 1948
to protect the industry, it ia highly desirable
that an international agreement be arrived
at and a protocol be agreed upon.
Immediately following the recent war Japan
and Germany had been pushed out of the
business of whaling, and an opportunity was
created for Canada to step into it. Whale
oil and whale fat are now considered edible
products; and whale oil bas been refined to
such a degree that it commands a high price
in the world. This is particularly apparent
at a time like this when there is an acute
shortage ini the supply of fats.
At the time of demobilization Canada had
a fleet of corvettes, and ther-e were other
ships which could have been purchased at a
reasonable price. These could have been
converted into whale catchera and factory
ships. Corvettes are admirably adapted for
conversion into whale catchers, and no better
use could have been made of them than te
have sa converted them.
Had Canada been in a condition to take
her place in the whaling industry it wc>uld
have been a God-eend to this country. Unfortunately, for reasons whicb it would take
too long to recount here, it was not feasible
for ber to do so at that lime. Whaling was
considered to be a highly speculative trade;
and Canadian capital had so mazy proven
avenues of investment that our capitalists
thought it a bit fantastic to suggest tbat
they should put tbeir money into Antarctic
whaling fleets. Yet this enterprise bas proved
to be a very good inveatment. Tbe goverfiment of the Netherlands went so far as te
subscribe several million dollars te sustain its
whaling industry. The difficulty is that in
times of depressi-on, as in the years 1931 te
1934, there is an over-production of whale
products, prîces are depressed, and a few
companies come to grief. Consequently, prospective inveatora are discouraged. But I think
that at the earliest possible moment the
Canadian Goverument sbould consider subsidizing a Canadian wbaling industry in order
that Canada may take ber proper place as a
whaling country. I am convineed that such
action would produce very substantial and
gratifyîng results.
I arn wholly in faveur of the agreemnent
and the protocol, because it wîll not only
protect the industry at large and prevent the
wanton destruction of whales, but it will also
protect the capital investments which have
been made in this undertaking. I deplore the
fact that Canada oould nlot see its way clear
to enter tbe field; and I suggest tbat, even
though government assistance be mnvolved, we
would be weil advised to consider tbe posei-

bility of engaging in this business to produce
fats and other whale producta for use in this
country and elsewhere.
Tbe wbalinig industry is divided into four
branches. In the first place we have the
whale catchers-abipa wbich go after wbales
and' shoot harpoona from a gun. Wbale
catcbing is a mucb less adventurous and
dangerous process than it was fifty or sixty
years ago. Next there is the factory sbip, to
wbicb the wbales are towed by the whale
catchera, and wbere tbey are bauled on deck
and reduced teoail and other by-products.
Then there la the land plant, wbicb is a
refinery of wbale products. Finally, of course,
there ia the agency whicb distributes whale
products on tbe markets of the world. All
tbese branches of the wbaling industry are
prosperous and-particularly the land plants
and the distributing agencies-offer many lines
of employment wbich would be of great
advantage eeonomically and industrially to
aur Canadian people.
Therefore, while giving my support ta the
motion, I tbink it expedient and prudent ta
draw ta the attention of tbe government, the
advisability of encouraging and assisting
Canada ta take ber place in the whaling
industry of the world.
The motion was agreed ta.
TARIFFS AND TRADE
UNITED NATIONS CONFERENCEGENERAL AGREEMENT

On the Orders of the Day:
Hon. WISHART MeL. ROBERTSON.
Befare tbe Orders of the Day are proceeded
with, I sbould like ta say a word or two as ta
aur course in the immediate future. Honourable senators may recaîl ýthat after I introduced tbe resolution for tbe appraval af the
Geneva Trade Agreements, the subj ectmatter of the resolution, by mutual cansent,
was referred te the Standing Committee on
Canadian Trade Relations. Several meetings
were beld before the Christmas recess. Since
that time there bave been na further meetings,
partly because I wanted ta ascertain wbat
would be the procedure as regards a probable
reference of the subi ect-matter, or of legislatien arising out of it, ta a joint cammittee of
the Senate and tbe Huse of Commons ta
which tbe Prime Minister referred same time
ago. As ýtbis course will probably be tbe one
taken, no useful purpose would be served by
the Standing Committee on Canadian Trade
Relations undertaking ta examine witnesses
otber than, perhaps, those from goverument

SENATE
departments, some of whom already have
given certain evidence and information ýto the
committee.
I therefore suggest that a meeting of the
Canadian Trade Relations Committee be held
next Tuesday morming; and to facilitate that
meeting, I shall propose later today that the
Sonate adjourn until next Monday at 8 o'clock
in the evening. That will give the members
of the Standing Committee on Canadian
Trade Relations an opportunity to decide
whether they wish further to consider the
general subject. Perhaps, under these circumstances, they may see fit to report at an early
date, whereupon a general discussion in this
house might proceed. 0f course honourable
senators are aware that this reference of the
subjeet-matter to the committee does nlot
preclude them from speaking to the resolution
here if they wish to. But if we follow the
course I have suggested, it would seem to me
that any further information required by
biniou ible seoators. whethcr members of thi-.
sýtaniding committee or not, can be secured.
and that in due course, but as early as possible,
we might go on with the consideration of this
resoijition.

remarks of the honouahie leader oppoýsite
(Hon. Mr. Haig). in wlîo-c naie the motion

I must admit a treinendous lack of
knowledge in regard to the i'ules of this
bonourabie body;: but firýt of ahl. when the
debate on the .Xddress xvas taking place. 1
found several of mny honourablc colleagues

SENATE PROCEDURE
TARIFFS AND TRADE

Right Hon. IAN A. MACKENZIE: May 1
risc Lo a question of privilege? 1 arn not yet
very familiar with the rules of this house.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Carry on.
Hon. JOHN T. HAIG: Before the honourable senator proceeds, may I say a word. Perhaps it is a littie difficuit for such an experW
-iomn as niy right honourable fricnd
(Riglit Hon. Mr. Mackenzie) to undcrstand
our method of procedure in this chamber. We
do not stick very close to rules; we neyer have.
This condition has grown fromn following the
practice of the House of LordÉ in the British
parliament. In order that the honourable
senr+or may ba fully informed. it has been our
practice. as to a resolution, for iýnstance, to refer
t.he subject matter of the resolution to an
appropriqf-' comnmittee for consideration. In
another place the varlous ministers are available to furnish the house with information;
but there is no one here to perform that
function. Therefore, in order that honourable
senators may obtain the information that is
necessary before voting on legislation, the
minister or the officials of t.he department
concerned are asked to appear b-efore one of
our committees.
Technically, my right honourable friend is
quite correct in lis stand. I spoke on the
resolution conccrning the Geneva agreements,
and at the conclusion of my remarks I
adjourned the debate. I did so because I
wanted to retain the right to speak when thc
committee made its report. We have adopted
the practice-which is not confirmed by our
rules--of carrying along a debate ini this way,
the understanding being that when the order
is called any senator may speak on it; but
the order reinains in the name of the person
who adjourned the debate.
5853-11

143

Right Hon. Mr. MACKENZIE: I greatly
appreciate the courtesy extended to, me by the
honourable leader opposite (Hon. Mr. Haig);
but I must say that as a newcomer here I canflot support this principle of referring legislation to committees.
A very able and accomplished friend of
mine the other day introduced a bll-I will
flot mention the name of it-about which I
knew nothing whatsoever. I was then asked,
as were other honourable senators, to support
the principle of the bill. My honourable
friend from Churchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar) took
exception to it. I too would certainly take
exception to it. I think the principle of a bill
should be endorsed by this chamber before
the bill is referred to committee. 1 say this
because I think that under our constitution it
is an abrogation of the essential fonctions and
duties of the second chamber of Canada to
consent to, on second reading, and endorse
the principle of a measure which it does not
ondcrstand.
I heard something the other day about the
People's Fraternal Order. I think "the people"
mcans the people of Canada-ail of the
people whom we here represent, not by election but by appointment. I should like to
have heard the mierits or demerits of that
point discussed in this chamber before tht
bill was referred to committee. There is an
old Latin saying: Delegatus non potest delegare. We are ahl delegates by appointment
from the people of the Dominion of Canada,
and it is an abrogation of the essential functions of thîs chamber to refer measures to
committee before they have been folly and
freely discussed here. To refer them to committee first seems to me to be dispensing with
our fundamental duties.
I do not want to appear at aIl arrogant or
dictatorial the first time that I say a word
herc. The procedore in the Senate is new to
me. I have, thoogh, some little knowlýedge of
the historie procedore of parliaments. My
good friend the leader opposite (H-on. Mr.
Haig) mentioned the buse of Lords. I know
something about the history of that institution in the Old, Country, and I think the
Senate of Canada shoold. have far more independence of character and procedure than
prevails there.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I rise to a question of
privilege. I did flot say that our miles are the
same as the rules of the House of Lords; but
when the Senate wa.9 established its original
rules were based upon those of the House of
Lords.
Right Hon. Mr. MACKENZIE: I accept
immediately the correction of my honourable
friend. For years in another place I advo-

SENATE

cated the alteration of the rules there; but
from my short experience as a member of this
honourable and august body I feel that its rules
need far more alteration than do those of
the other place. I say that, honourable senators, with all deference. I am not criticizing
anyone at all. This chamber is part of the
Parliament of Canada, and if we do not maintain our essential authority, if we give that
authority to committees all the time, we are
likely to be regarded as people who are unable
or afraid to express our own free and independent opinions. I say that without antagonism and without any assumption of superior
authority, because of course I have not got
any.
I have been here ten days, and half the proceedings of this house in that time have not
been audible where I sit. I suggest that the
Table might very well be m.oved down to the
centre of the chamber, and that the Clerk
should, in a ringing voice, repeat every single
motion that is made. I hear remarks by my
good friend opposite with regard to divorce,
and I hear bills introduced which I have
never heard of before and am not in a position
to understand. I tell you that if you want
to keep this assembly the august and honourable body that it is intended to be under the
Constitution of Canada, you must provide for
greater clarity of expression and discussion,
and fuller explanations on second readings
before measures are referred to any committee
of this bouse. So far as I am concerned, I
wish to reserve my rights completely as to any
support that was presumed to be given by
this chamber to any second reading of a bill
in the last ten days. I wish to preserve my
independence of thought and of action, in line
with the fundamental rights of the Senate of
Canada under our constitution, for free protection of the interests of the people against
any special or privileged interests.
Hon. THOMAS VIEN: Honourable senators, I have listened with a great deal of
interest to the remarks of the leader of the
opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig) and the eloquent
and courageous, or at least energetic, speech
by the right honourable senator from Vancouver (Right Hon. Mr. Mackenzie), who
comes to this house with all the glamour of
his shining record as house leader in another
place, and with all the zeal of a neophyte.
When I came to this chamber I felt very much
as the right honourable gentleman does now,
but on my very first appearance here I
received wise advice from the then leader of
the government in the Senate, who is now His
Honour the Speaker (Hon. Mr. King). That
advice was to this effect: the atmosphere here

is different from that in another place; we
carry on our discussions under different conditions altogether.
It is well to remember that the Senate's
rules are made for the Senate, that the Senate
is not made for its rules. Our rules are flexible, and by general consent of the house and
with leave from His Honour the Speaker, they
are always interpreted in the most liberal way.
It is, however, advisable to follow the rules as
closely as possible and to infringe upon them
only so far as may be necessary. Rules are
the resuit of wisdom and experience. They
have been adopted in all parliamentary institutions for the orderly conduct of debato. We
can never go far w rong when we adhere to
our rules as closely as possible, permitting
only such flexibility in their application as circumstances may be deemed to require. That

brief statement is inspired by the remarks
of the honourable leader of the opposition.
I think it would not be wise to allow to
pass unchallenged the implied suggestion of
the
right
honourable
gentleman
from
Vancouver (Right Hon. Mr. Mackenzie) that
we are shirking our responsibility by sending
measures to a committee before they have
been thoroughly discussed in the Senate itself.
That is not so at all. When a resolution or
measure comes before the Senate, there is the
widest possible privilege of discussion. That
privilege is much wider here than it is in the
other house, for our membership is by no
means as numerous, and we do not have to
contend with partisan political aspects and
their effect on the electorate. We are, if I
nay so put it, the elder parliamentarians of
this country, and we have a duty to consider
thoroughly all matters that corne before us.
It is my conviction, based on my experience
during the five years that I have been a member of this bouse, that bills receive much more
consideration and are pondered on much more
carefully in the Senate than in another place.
What makes for good legislation is not the
length of speeches, but careful consideration
by people of wide experience. It is that kind
of careful consideration that every legislative
measure receives in the Senate; but, as pointed
out by the honourable leader opposite (Hon.
Mr. Haig), instead of discussing the principle
of a bill at great length in this chamber it is
sometimes expedient and more practical to
refer it to a committee where experts will
be present to answer questions and give
honourable members information upon which
to base their judgment. My honourable friend,
if he will look, will find that there are a
number of standing committees, and that most
honourable senators are members of those

FEBRUARY 12, 1048
committees. Furtber, if my lionourable friend
sits hn these committees he wiii observe the
close attention wbicb the members there give
to the matters under consideration.
Legislation, after being considered in comnmittee, is referred back to tbe biouse! wbere.
under olir rules, we bave the privilege of
amending it, nlot only on tbe motion for
third reading. but even later, wben tbe bill
is ready to pass. We have, therefore, every
opportunity of expressing an opinion; but it
is an expedient and wise procedure tbat permits us, wben a bill is submitted to us witbout
sufficient information, to require tbe men
responsible for bringing it to our attention
to appear before a committee and explaîn tbe
measure.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: The subjeetmatter is referred to a committee.
Hon. Mr. VIEN: The subjeet-matter may
be referred to a committee witbout bonourable senators being committed. te the principle of the bill.
I am quite sure tbat if I were hn the position
of tbe right bonourable senator from Vancover (Riglit Hon. Mr. Mackenzie) I wouid
feel exactly as be does. We must pay attention to legislation, and we sliould not brusb
aside our responsibilities or shift tbema te
members of a committee hn order to relieve
ourselves of a littie trouble in tbe proper consideration of tbat legislation. The fact is.
bonourable senators-and I am sure -the riglit
bonourable gentleman fromn Vancouver wili
sbortly realize that lie bas been wrong in bis
assumption-that the legislation wbicb cames
before this bouse receives ahl the attention
and consideration it deserves.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, bear.
Hon. WISHART MeL. ROBERTSON:
Honourable senators, may 1 be permitted to
speak again with regard to a matte-r on whicb
I thouglit I bad made myself clear wlien I
spoke before?
The bonourable senator from Vancouver
(Right Hon. Mr. Mackenzie) spoke to me on
twvo or three occasions about tbe resolution
te approve tbe Geneva trade agreement, wbicb,
is Standing on our Order Paper. It was my
wbicb
observations
friend's
honourable
prompted me te make tlie explanation wbicb
I did.
I helieve that a difference of opinion bas
arisen hecause of the fact tbat we in this
bouse utihize tbe device of referring the suliject-matter, rather tban the bill or resolution
itself, to a standing committee. Tliat does
not mean that the bill will not in due course
be fulhy discussed. 1 pointed out to the lion-

145

ourable gentleman that that procedure is nlot
unknown to the other house, tbough. as the
honourable leader opposite (Hon. Mr. Haig)
bas pointed out, it is mndulged. in less frequently there than in this hous,-. The reason
that we so frequently adipt this proceclure
is the iack of ability of the government repreeentative here to supply ail the necessary
information to honoura;ble senators. My honourable friend must remember that in the
other bouse there are eighteen or nineteen
ministers of the Crown, and that tbey, like
my bonourable friend wben -be beld a portfolio, are fully informed as to the background
of the particular legisiation to be presented.
Furtbermore, these ministers, who preside
over the departments, have the support of
parliamentary secretaries and other personnel.
Under sucb circumstances there could be no
excuse for referring the subi cet-matter of a
bill to a committee. In tbis bouse the full
responsibility for voicing the viewpoint of the
government and supplying information falîs
upon one person. The honourable gentleman
wbo presides over the deliberations of the
Senate and my honourable friend from Vancouver, botb of whom have had long parliamentary experience, might well be able to
supply adequate information on ahl legisiation
eoming before this bouse; but I must frankly
admit that I am not able to die s0.
I wish to make one point clear. The faet
that bonourable senators 'have not spoken on
the order in question, since the subi ect-matter
was referred to committee does not indicate
that tliey bave not a perfect riglit to do so.
My suggestion is that we conclude the consideration of tbe subjeet-matter in committee
on Tuesday next. My bonourable friend was
in the other bou-se wben the agreement was
negotiated, and be is familiar with its background. Sbould be or any other bonourable
senator desire to discuss the Geneva trade
agreement 'before tbe committee reports back
to tbis bouse, I sec no reason wby he sbouhd
not do so. Then, sbould furtber information
be desired frorm the Standing Cornmittee, the
debate could be adijourned; and, in due
course, when the committee bas reported
back, tlie debate would be continued.
I wish to assure my lionourable friend from
Vancouver that the procedure followed in this
bouse is not adopted with a view to cuttihg
off discussion or evading responsibility; it is
simply a device to facilitate the securing of
information which is required by honourable
senators.
Hon. J. J. KINLEY: Honourable senators,
Iam sure we adi listened witli pleasure to the
remarks of tbe bonourable senator froma Vancouver (Right Hon. Mr. Mackenzie), wlio lias

SIENATE

recently corne to uis from the turbulent atrnosphere of the other house. I bcîlieve bis remarks
were a call to action. and should have a
salutary effcct. May 1 use this occasion to
add one or twe thoughts on the subject?
First, I bolieve that we in this house too
frequently suspend the raies to facilitate the
passing of legisiation. Legislation which is
lying on the Table or in course
of
going throiieh parliament is subject to public
opinion; therefore onoughi tirno should be
aliowed to elap>se to get the public reaction.
The rules are designed to permit of proper
delay, and a bill can go forward oniy one step
each day. It soems to me that with the
amouet of work we hav e to do in this house
it should not be necessai'y to suspend the
rudes so frcqucntlvý.
One reasen why thiere
Omens be s0 little

As te the rides, I do nct think they work
inuch damnage; the fault is with ourselves
when we allow things to go through without
proper attention. The other day the honourable senator froni Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr.
Roehuck) introdîîced a bill to incorporate a
"tpeople's" society. I did flot like the tcrm
"lpeople's" in -this connection; 1 did flot think
àt cnîho tic! the real pu-rpose of the bill. The
principle and purpose of the bill was the incorporation of a number cf persons w'ho wantedl
to get togcther for cultural and other benefits.
When the bill went to, committee I said that
I did net approve cf the use of the word
"people's", becauýse the "people" are ail the
people of Canada, and te appiy it te this
society rnighit give these persons an importance which they did flot deserve. The honcurable senater ivho sponsored the bill replied,
"I do net like it myseîf," and he and I discussed -one or twe ýother terras whieh rnight
be used. This teck place in commnittee. It

mnay be that we shouid have voiced our
opinion on this foature cf his bill when it came
up for second reading.
Ie aIl kindness J wouid say that when a
former member cf the other place cornes inte

urge that theýre is in the other bouse te keep
eneeself hofoie the public aou let the people
know one's views. Rather, when this or that
matter cornes before us, there is an inclination
te sýay.'Wei we xvili let it go easiiy." We
do net do mu-Lch about it. I believe there is
ee.ough experience aed braies among or
memb.ership te make this place a great forum
for the consideration of public affairs and the

the people cf this country and prove cf real

Let it net 1)0 forgotten, honeurable senators,

Hon. Mr. CRERAR: I weuld like te ask
the leader a question. I arn not clear as to
what is te be the course cf the legisiation
with respect te the approval of the so-calied
Geneva agreement. A metion was iatreduced
bore; there was some discussion on it; the

FEBRUARY 12, 1M4
leader of the opposition intimated that he
would prefer to have more information before
lie eontinued the discussion;Hon. Mr. HAIG: Correct.
Hon. Mr. CRERAR: -and, as a resuit, the
bouse agreed to send the resolution-

Hon.

Mr.

ROBERTSON: The

subject-

matter.
Hon. Mr. CRERAR: Well, the subjeetmatter of the resolution, to the committee.
I do flot think there is mucli difference lie-

tween sending a resolution and the subjeetmatter of a resolution to committee. Be that
as it may, there was a reference to a committee. where departmental officiais, and perliaps the Minister of External Affairs, could
attend and enlighten honourable members of
this bouse, including the leader opposite who
wished to get some additional information
as to what the whole matter was about and
what its value would be to this country. If I
understand ariglit, the leader suggested that
another meeting of the committee would lie
held, and that thereafter this question would
go to some joint committee of the Senate and
the Commons. I may be wrong, however,
and it is as to that arrangement that I sliould
like to have some information from the leader.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Honourable senators will recali the procedure in relation to
trade agreements: first. there are resolutions
moved concurrently in both bouses; then there
is legisiation arising out of the agreements.
In this particular case the resolution was
moved by myself and, after some remarks
from the leader of the opposition, by general
agreement the sulijeet-matter was referred to
the Standing Committee on Canadian Trade
Relations. There is, I think, this distinction
betwveen the resolution and a bill: the resolution still stands on our Order Paper, whereas
a bill, whcn referred, disappears from the
Order Paper and does not reappear until the
committee lias reported. I take it that the
reference of the subject-niatter is a metliud of

providing honourable senators with an opportunity to get additional information-information which, however, they miglit get, if they
so preferred. from any one of a dozen sources.
Ordinarily, under our practice, the committee
would briefly report back to the Senate, thougli
not usually in support or otlierwise of the

resolution, but rather to indicate that tliey had
ail the information they required. That, at
least, was the procedure

when the subjeet-

147

inga which took place before the adjournment
were limited to, the receipt of information
fromn departmental officiais. No other witn-esses were called, aithougli there was some
suggestion that others sliould lie heard later.
After we reassembled I consulted with the
chairman of the committee, and it appeared
that the officiais whom it liad been intended
to raIl froma the departments were not in town,.
So for one reason or another there have been
no further meetings of the committee. What
I amn now suggesting is that those meetings
should be resumed on Tuesday morning. llow
long the committee may decide to continue
hearing witnesses will lie for the committes
ta determine. But I would point out that
either the re-lolution or legislation arising out
of the resolution will in due course be referred
to a joint committee of the Senate and the
House of Commons. This being so, honourable senators will appreciate that to cali ais
witnesses before our committee goveroment
officiais who will be called befo-re, the joint
committee a week or two later would not serve
their convenience. Ahl I am suggesting at the
moment is that the committee will meet
Tues-day morning and that officiais of the
department wiil be available as witnesses. It
is for the Standing Committee on Canadian
Trade Relations to decide how much furtlier
information it would like to get. The hearings sa far have been vcry thoreugh, and if
the committee do not desire outside evidence
it is likely that they will report back ta this
house very soon.
I wish ta emphasize, however, that if any
honourable senator feels that he aiready lias
the information lie desires, lie is at liberty
ta continue the discussion now. even though
the subjeet-matter lias bccn referred ta committee.
Hon. Mr. CRERAR: May I suggest that
the hon-ouralile leader opposite (Hon. Mr.
llaig) lias adjourned the deliate, and the way
would have ta lie cleared.

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON:
Altliough my
honourable friend (Hon. Mr. Haig) lias
adjourned the debate, if it is the desire of
the bouse to have tlie Whip adI aura it, as

was done in the case of the Speech from ths
Throne, I amn quite sure my honourabîs frisnd
opposite would lie willing. That is the best
explanation I can make.

discussion was resumed.

But the point I wisli ta make is this. As
honourable senators may remember, the hear-

SENATE

If, after this cornmittee has concluded its
bearings, a bill is brought before both boeuses,
thon on the second reading of that bill the
Msubject-rnatter again would be referred to one
of our appropriate committees for discussion.
It is rny understanding that it is now proposed
to refer the resolution to a joint comrnittee.
Hýon. Mr. HAIG:

No.

Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: Will the honourable leader (Mon. Mr. Robertson) correct me
if I arn wrong?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSýON: I arn not certain
as to whether the procedure is to refer to
joint commnittce the resolution or the logisiation arising from the resolution. The point
I arn tndeavouring to make is that our comnmittee might possibly have called outside witnesses in addition to departmental officiais,
but il is not iikely to do so now because a
joint committee of both houses would have
the opportunity of hearing outside witnesses
in due course.
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: I think this is a
very important point. If rny memory serves
me rigbt, thero hias been only one case in
which the subjeet matter of a bill hias been
referred to a committee before second reading.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE:

This is not a bill.

Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: I know 'ibat. I amn
:trying to make the distinction between a resolution and a bill. My unofficiai information is
that the officiais who recently appeared before
otîr comrnittee expect to appear before a joint
commi'tee of both bouses. I believe il is
p)erfee(tl.r logical that the joint committee
furtber examine the treaties referred to in
ibe resolution. and that n bill be brought
down later. Thon, in the light of the discussions in the joint committee, this bouse can
give the bill whatcever treatment it considers
proper.
Honourable senators, it is a very important
point whether -the principle of legislation is
approvod, now that ils subjeet matter may be
referred to a commi'ttee before it is given
second reading. I know that in the past lis
Honour the Speaker expressed his view on
this matter in no uncertain ternis. I was
rule(1 out of order hast vear wben 1 suggesîed
Ih5t a certain measure eoncerning oleomargarinýe be openly investigated before it was
given s. eond rcading. Therefore the question
10 me is very clear; il is one of resohution
versus bill.
l'ho Hon. teo SPEA\KER: The situation is
t bis The order w as allow cd to stand, and was
onhy rc,%ýrted to by beave of the Senate. The

righî bonourable senalor from Vancouvor
(Right Hon. Mr. Mackenzie) then launched
ioto argument as to the propriety of the Sonate
iefeî'ring a resolution of this kind to a coininit tee.
It is a well known fact Ibat titis chaîuber
is a deliberating body. As a former kýader.
the lato Senator Dandurand. used to say. wve
investigate and adjuidicate. That lias been
tlte practice in this bouse. There are certain
rules thal govern our debate, and they are
applied by the Speaker to the best of bis
k4nowlcdge. W hen 1 was gox ernrnent leader
in titis bouse during part of tbe wartime
iioriod. I i)roiigbt before tbe bouse a motion
aulhorizing tbe Sondte to consider in coinmiîtee. varions financi-al maýtters before tbey
reaehed tbe ebamber in the form of a billlegisiation that ordinarily would not reacb
Ibis boeuse until the last days of the session.
That bas beon -the practice ever since, and I
believe it bas been a very xvise one, becaxîse
ît bias given bonourabie senators an opportunity to secure information tbat tbey wouid
not get in tbis chamber.
In so far as this resolulion is concerned, if
My right bonourabie friend froma Vancouver
(Rigbt Hon. Mr. Mackenzie) wiih attend one
or two of our committees hoe wili nol raise an
objection sucb as the one he bias raised today,
for bie wili sec the value of our procodure not
onlv lu the memibers of the Sonate, but 10 tbe
people ot Canada as w'eli.
My bonourable friend tbe senalor from
Ottawa (Hon. Mr. Lambert) bas referred to
the Dairy Industry Bill. In respect to bis tbe
rule of tbe Sonate 's tbis: the Sonate may at
any lime beforo the bill is passed, move for the
reconsideration of any clause thereof aiready
passed. This rule governs the ordinary bill.
A bill before tbe Senate for second reading cannot b)0 amended except by an amieodment tbat
would delay or destroy the bill. In the ordinary
heýislalion tbe bill on second reading is discussed and, if passed on second reading, may
then be sent lu one of tbe standing commitîces
for furtber consideration and ameedment. It
comes back 10 the bouse for third rcading, and
on third reading an objection can be laken,
and tbe bill can be rejected or amended.
I sbould like to impress ripon tbe ri-lht
bonourablo senator (Rigbt Hon. Mr. Mack1enzie) thal the procedure in this lieuse is
different from that in another place. Wre have
certain ruies that govern our debate, but tbey
are nol of the nature of those whicb govero
debate in the House of ýCommons. We do not
look, as tbey do, upon the political effeet. I
arna quite satisfied tbat the procedure folhowod
in relation to Ibis resohution is sqiecb Ibal any
group of men xvould confirrn it as being proper.

seven months studying these problems in conferonco with world represontatives. They have

matter to the attention of the Senate, and,
to aid the membors in bocoming familiar witb
the nogotiations that took place in Geneva, hoe
suggostod that the resolution could properl
be roforrod to the Committoo on Trado Relations, bof ore which the officiaIs who ropresentod Canada at Geneva could be called to

with propriety congratulate thern on the
generous congratulations they have already
received.
The debates that we have had in the Senate
this session on questions of international
import have been to me a matter of great
interest and rnuch satisfaction. I think that
the tendency shown in this house of later
years to deal with such questions is fitting and
as it should be. There are rnany matters of
dornestie imnport that members of the House
of Commons, in close contact as they are witb
tiieir constituencies, feel an impulse and - a
necessity to discuss in a way that is not appropriate in this bouse. It is fltting that those
questions should be under consideration there
more than here. But 1 conceive that in this
bouse, with its different atrnosphere and with
the wider experi-ence of those who are hereperhaps I might say the greater knowledge
5853-12

of international affairs--it is a good thing for
the Senate, for parliarnent and for Canada
that such an intelligent effort bas been here
made to discuss questions of international
import. May 1 say that among the speeches
I have listened to in this debate, three have
particularly impressed me. One was by my
good friend the senator frorn Ottawa (Hon.
Mr. Lambbrt), one by rny friend frorn
De Salaberry (Hon. Mr. Gouin), and the other
by my old deskrnate, the senator from Inkerman (Hon. Mr. Hugessen). The last rnentioned
speech so irnpressed me and so carried me
away that after I got out frorn under its
influence I was worried about it. The soothing logic of that speech and the rather reassuring attitude that ail was well, or at least
that ail rnight be well, left me rather disturbed.
Whenever I corne under an influence of that
kind I find it a great antidote to go back and
read the speeches made by Winston Churchill
during the eight or nine years before the iast
great war-a war which I arn not sure is over
yet. Once before in this house I referred to
a bock of Churchill's speeches published by bis
son, and called Arma and the Covenant. Those
speeches, deiivered right up to 1939, contained
pronouncernents year by year, warning Britain
of what was ahead of her and pointing out the
necessity for ber to sec the danger while there
was stili tirne. But the attitude of the British
House of Commons and of the British people
wss "Oh, it is only Winnie speaking", and they
did not take birn seriously. They did not
understand the speeches or know the man as
tbey do today. But by looking back upon
what be said then one learns a great lesson
for the tirnes we are now facing.
In April, just before tihe war ended, I made
a speech in this house about the mission of
those who were going to the San Francisco
conference. Honourable senators were very
kind to me about what I had to say. At that
tirne 1 think we ail had ideals and convictions
about peace and the prospect for the future;
but in the past two years they have been
sadly shaken. Notwithstanding what sorne
foreign emissaries may say, I do not think
there is one intelligent, responsible person in
Canada, the United States or Great Britain
who is not convinced of the absolute essentiality of peace, and the necessity of every man
doing ail that is hurnanly possible to make sure
that we attain that end. But we cannot
accomplish it merely by wishful thinking.
I do not propose to offer here tonight any
solutions for our problem. If I did suggest
any, bonourabie senators would not accept
them. The only motive I have in speaking
at this tirne is to irnpress upon honourable
senators, if I can, the necessity of our facing

SENATE

realities and doing a little thinking on our
own part, and in the hope that from the sum
total of our deliberations the people of Canada
may receive some direction towards a solution of those problems. Two years ago we
thought that our delegates were going to San
Francisco to work out a solution for peace,
with everybody in complete harmony in working towards that end. But today, in the light of
what we know, it seems to me that we have to
face our problems with a little different
attitude. We have to ask ourselves two questions: What is the best way to prevent war?
and, How best can we protect ourselves if war
should come?
There are some very obvious propositions
which I should like to submit to you tonight.
In the first place, it is my belief that the
preaching of the gospel of peace while our
enemies are arming thernselves has twice resulted in disaster to the world-disaster which
on either occasion could have been prevented.
I submit to you for your solemn thought that
one-sided disarmament is the height of folly;
that unpreparedness in face of an arming
eneny did not promote peace or prevent
either of the last wars, but on the contrary,
invited them, and almost resulted in our
destruction. Twice we marched riglit to the
edge of disaster and looked over the brink.
IRepeated a third time, we shall very likely go
over the brink. It is said of the Lord, "He
will not ahvays chile; neitlher will he keep
his anger forever."
We may as well face realities. There has
never been permanent peace in this world.
Looking over history as a realist, not as a
prophet, I an mnoved to the conclusion that
so far peace has been only an indefinite,
uncertain period between wars. Fatuous appeaseaients and one-sided disarmament do not
pronote peace, and have never produced
national security. Se, in the remarks I am
going to address to yen tonight, my approach
is based on the belief that we have to choose
one of two alternatives-a complete and effective disarmanment of the nations, enforced by a
strong, ar
Unite
md Nations organization,
or a union of the peace-loving democracies in
an effective armed defence against aggressors.
When I say tiat,
ye know as well as I do of
what I an thinking. I am thinking about
Russia. I am not se foolish as to predict an
immîcediate war. I do net believe there is
danger of immediate war. It has never been
the policy of denocracies to bring about a
war when they are prepared and their enemies
are not. Histo- has shown repeatedly that
the reverse is the fact, and that wars have
come when democracies have not been ready
and their enemies have been. I call your
attention to a very significant statement which

was made by General Eisenhower in Time
magazine. I am net fond of citing that magazine; I believe the last time I did se an
ionourable senator opposite called me to order
for some of the things I said about it. The
words I quoite are those. not of Time, but
of General Eisenhower. He said: "There will
be no war soon, because Russia is net ready."
That very cynical remark comes from a great
man whio meant that we should read between
the lines: there will not be a war soon because
Russia is net ready.
I am not concerned about Russia alone.
The thense of my speech is Russia and the
atomic bomb. Nor am I concerned solely
about the atomic bomb. These 'bombs, piled
in the arsenais of the United States, are perfectly harmless andi we need net fear them.
So far as Russia is concerned apart from the
atonie bomb, the peace-loving democraciesI arm thinking of the United States and
Canada on this continent, and of Great Britain and the British Empire generally-have
nothing te fear, for they can take care of
themselves. But I am fearful about the
combination of Russia and the atomie bomb,
for it is msy belief that Stalin and those
associated with hsim are a greater danger to
peace and te the welfare of the world than
was tise
aiser in 1914, or Hitler in 1939. I
will triy, in the formn of four questions which
are the hasis of isv reiarks iere tonigh t, te
give you my reasoas for making that
assertion. Fiow
dangerouis is the atomic
bomsb? Sedon, how soon will Russia have
the atomie bonb? Third, what will sie do
with it when sie has it in military qusantities?
Fouirth, what are we going te do about it? I
do not believe that intelligent people anywhare in the woirld. Calada in iuded, can
aftford not te ask these questions and scek
the answrers.
With regard te tie first question, ionourable senatrs inay tiink it superflious for me
to offer anY information. We know the bonb
is dangerous.
Bat there is a difference
between knowing a thing and having a real
appreciation of its dangers. Let ns go back
in our minds to August 6, 1945, when just
one bomb was dropped on the Japanese city
of Hiroshimn, a city of 350,000 people. I take
this extract fren the recent issue of a magazine. The author of the article mentions the
serious Halifax explosion during the first
world war, and then, he continues:
On the wari mîorning of Auguîst 6, 1945, an
Xmerican Suiperfortress dropped over Hiroshsimîa an atomie bomissb equjîivalent to 20,000
tons of TXT., almost sevcn timses the amount
thlat devastated Halifax. It flattened G0 per
cent of the city. killed 78,159, left 13.993 nissing
and 9.,428 seriously injured.

FEBRUARY 16, 1948

To those of Hiroshima who first saw the flash
of light that warned them of the bomb, it looked
like a ball of fire three-quarters of a mile across.
Heat at its centre was 100 million degrees Fahrenheit. People in the street below the bomb's
centre were seared to death instantly. Eyes
of Japanese plane watchers who looked to see
what it was, melted from their sockets.
The heat of the bomb ignited fires. The
intense heat also set up a pressure which released gales and fanned fires and uprooted
buildings. Loese in Hiroshima that d.ay were
forces of a tornado, an earthquake and a
bolocaust that not even the seven channels of
the Motyan River could stop.
Many indoors were not killed by the flash,
but when they went outdoors they died from
fire or falling buildings. As mothers worked to
dig their babies out of debris, they could hear
their friends and relatives crying in the street,
Towarde
"Please kill me, please kill me."
night the stench of the dead, the burnt and of
people continually vomiting filled -the air.
No hospital was left standing te shelter the
injured and sick. Of 30,0 physicians 260 were
unable to help; of 2,400 nurses and orderlies
and aides 1,800 were made casualties in a
single instant. Towards evening doctors first
noticed symptoms of a strange and new illness
-radiation sickness. It prevented blood from.
coagulating or white corpuscles forming.
Observers who came to examine the city found
it looked on its outskirts like 'any bombed
European city.
I shall net take time to read all of this
article, honourable senators. A year later the
Americans made tests of the bombs at Bikini.
I have here an extract from the official report
to the United States government. It reads
as follows:
As was demonstrated by terrible havoc
wrought at Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the Bikini
tests indicate that future wars employing
atomie bombs will destrey nations and civilization.
But that is not all. That bomb was in its
experimental stages three years ago. May I
trespass on your time to read an extract from
an article appearing in the Atlantic Monthly
of October 1947.
Many of us may still be thinking of atomie
attack in terms of Hiroshima, of a colossal
explosion and a death roll of 100,000 people.
While vigorous "security" prevents any specific
disclosure by scientists of the atomic developments of the past two years, w-e can he certain
that the effect of the next atom bomb, if one is
ever dropped, will bear about as much resemblance to the Hiroshima bomb as a British
blockbuster bore te a hand grenade. Dr. J.
Robert Oppenheimer, in charge of manufacturing
the first atom bomb, estimates ýthat were the
United States to be attacked at some future
time, "atomie weapons might kill 40 million
Americans in a single night."
This, of course, is from an American magazine.
Airmen and scientists already refer te the
"old-type
as
missiles
Hiroshima-Nagasaki
bombs." and the Atomie Scieutists of Chicago
describe them as "the first relatively primitive
atomic bombs." Professor William A. Higinbotham. of the Manhattan Project, stated that
5853-12j

the first boumb contained only "a few pounds of
atonie explosive." Accordiug to a statement
distributed by the National Committee on
Atomic Information, "every effort was made to
keep the first explosions to a minimum".
Honourable senators, let me call to mind
how far the development of the airplane and
the rocket bomb has been advanced in the
last three years. For instance, a new airplane
has been developed with a speed that was not
thought of when Hiroshima was bombed.
Near the end of the war London was under
attack from rocket bombs launched in
France, and had our boys not destroyed the
launching bases, London would -have been
wiped out by these comparatively primitive
bombs. What might have happened had several of the bombs that are now in the possession of the Unitedi States been dropped on
London at that time?
Sumner Welles said in his last talk that
people are living under the shadow of death.
This is not a pleasant thing to hear. I could
make a speech. of a very different kindNero fiddled while Rome burned!-but when
I delivered a similar speech to the Vancouver
Board of Trade a year ago, and later met
some friends on the street who said "We
enjoyed your speech very much," I said, "The
last thing I wanted you to do was to enjoy it."
In addressing this chamber now I am not in
any sense making a popular speech. I do not
want it to he a popular speech. I am merely
endeavouring to discuss some of the things
that honourable senators know as well as I
do, but to do so in such a manner that we
can think about them in a practical, constructive way.
Thus, I have answered the first question.
I have not told you anything new, but perhaps, as a result of what I have said, you will
stop and think about this matter a little
more.
The second question is: Will Russia have
this atomic bomb, and if so, when? The first
point to which I should call your attention is
that Russia has evinced a very active desire
to possess this atomic bomb. IL sometimes
amazes me to think how little in our discussions amongst ourselves we talk about Igor
Gouzenko and the spy trials and what bas
been revealed right here in Ottawa, and the
fact that one of our members of parliament
is today in a penitentiary because of a campaign that was being directed from Russia.
For what purpose? Amongst other things, it
was to get information about the atomic
bomb.
It is a difficult matter te find a needle in
a haystack, but it is a lot easier if you know
that the needle is there. In one of his recent

SENATE

speeches in New- York General McNaughton
said that it is always easier to reach an
objective when you know there is a path
Ieading to it. So today, even if the Russians
have not stolen or otherwise obtained
information on the atomie bomb in Canada or
the United States, I do not think anyone is
foolish enough to doubt that what was going
on here in Ottawa was also going on in
Washington and other places.
Russia is in control of Berlin, and it is an
openly stated fact that she is using German
scientists to help ber develop the atomie
bomb. I read a year ago that Einstein gave
Russia five years at the outside to develop
the bomb. Time does not take long to go by;
a year bas gone by already. I have been
reading
a
speech
made
by
General
McNaughton before the Canadian Club of
New York a couple of months ago. In his
position he bas to be very conservative and
guarded in what be says. He stated: "There
are no real scientific secrets today, but the
danger will not corne for a while". That is
very unassuring, coming from a man who
knows as much as General McNaughton, and
I say that any nation which does not act on
the assumption that Russia will have the
atomie bomb dangerously soon is living in a
fool's paradise.
Now let me ask and answer the third question: What will Russia do if she bas the
bomb in military quantities? May I premise
my remarks with a statement that I think is
basic? War as it used to be fought, with two
nations of more or less equal strength and
equal arms, is a kind of sporting propostion as
to which you might say "Let the best one
win". But when the weapons are atomic
bombs, the unscrupulous nation that is prepared to use them without warning has a one
hundred per cent advantage, even if the
nation against which it is fighting bas jut
as many bombs. It is just a little more than
six years since Pearl Harbor. What happened
in December 1941? Officials of the Japanese
government were in Washington conferring
with high officials of the United States
government on peace, when, out of the blue,
Japanese planes dropped bombs on Pearl
Harbor and put the United States navy
practically out of business for the time being.
That is history. I ask honourable senators
this question: What would have happened to
the United States in December 1941 if Japan
had had the atomie bomb developed as we
believe it is now, and if in addition she had
had bases in Alaska, just alongside United
States territory? Living in Vancouver, as I
dIo, on looking up that coast, bearing in mind
the kind of planes there are today. Alaska
does not seem very far away. If Japan had

had such bombs and bases in 1941 and had
used them, the result on this American continent would have been a devastation the
consequences of which no one can imagine.
Would the Japanese have used the bombs?
Well they did use what weapons they bad
then.
Is there anybody who from what we know
would seriously suggest that the Russians, if
they considered the provocation sufficient,
would hesitate to do what the Japanese did?
If anyone here would seriously suggest thit,
perhaps he will think twice about it after I
develop this point. Let us just stop and take
stock. There was a time when I made a
similar speech to this, with less information
than I have now, and I was criticized for provoking Russia. But having read speeches by
Bevin, Anthony Eden, Churchill, Attlee and
Truman, and the kind of false statements that
Russians have made and published about
citizens of these democratic countries, I do
not think anybody need worry that anything
we say might provoke the Russians at this
time. If I thought that anything I have in
mind to say would aggravate the situation, of
course I would not say it.
Well, honourable senators, let us look at the
record of Russia. Let us look first at her
record prior to this war. I am rather fond of
quoting my own speeches, and I have before
me a copy of one that I made in 1935 before
the Vancouver Board of Trade. It was a long
speech, even longer that the one I am going to
inflict on you tonight. The Vancouver Board
of Trade thought enough of it, however.
to have it printed and circulated. At that
time I quoted fron Professor Hoover of Duke
University, from Walter Duranty and William
Henry Chamberlain. Professor Hoover, who
was also a fellow of the Social Science Research Council of the Soviet Union, stated
that on Decmber 27, 1929 Stalin announced
the policy of the complete liquidation of the
kulaki as a class. Honourable members will
recall that the kulaki were the prosperous
farmers in that country, a superior class of
people there. Listen to what Professor Hoover
said:
At least five million people were expected to
be involved in the liquidation of this class . . .
but a much larger number were involved . . .
In the course of the execution of the policy
some thousands of kulaki were shot. In some
cases they were executed when the only charge
against them was carrying on active propaganda
against coIlectivization. Many kulaki ai their
families committed suicide.
And thousands of them were sent to Siberia.
Let us see what the testimony of Walter
Duranty was, in February, 1933:
Recent decrees bristle vith words. like
"mercilessly" or "without pity," and the Bolshevik believe themselves no less bound by duty

FEBRUARY 16, 1948
"to smite and spare not" than the soldiers of
Aillah who offered unbelievers the choice between Allah and the sword.
It rnay horrify Americans to hear that a
thousand Gossack f amilies-five or six thousand
souls -have been removed en mnasse because
they opposed collectivization ... ailright, but
in the last ýthree years there were a million
other persons simiiarly removed."
And finally, here is what William Henry
Chamberlain said:
During the winter of 1932 and spring of 1933
stark famine stalked through the great areas
of Ukrania and the North Gaucasus, the lower
and middle Volga, and parts of Central Asia.
levying a 10 per cent death toîl on a population
of 50 to 60 million people.
Ten per cent of that number would be
between five and six million people.
0f the historic responsibility of the Soviet
government for the famine of 1932-33 there can
be no reasonable doubt. In con'trast teo its
policy of 10,21-23 it stifled any appeal for
foreign aid by denying the very fact of the
famine and by refusing to foreign journaliste
the right to travel in the famine regions until
it was ail over. Famine *was quite deliberately
employed as an instrument of national policy
as the last means of breaking the resistance of
the peasantry.
Ail the aristoeracy, the intelligentsia and the
bourgeoisie who were capable of opposition
frým outside were already dead, banished, or in
prison camps.
That is testimony of fifteen years ago. Let
us corne down a little later. We know that
at the beginning of the last war Mr. Stalin
was Mr. Hitler's partner. In the latter part
of the war we got so much in the habit of
talking about our noble allies that we forgot
a lot of the things that we said andI thought
about Mr. Stalin in 1939, 1940 and 1941. 1
think, though, that our memories have heen
rudely revived througli the publication by the
United States government within the last
month of documents they found in Germany,
which prove-what of course we aIl knewthat prior to the beginning of the war in 1939
the Germans had plotted witli the Russians
to divide up Europe and drive France and
Britain out of control there.
Then let us take the record of Rusia's
relations with hier late allies since the last war.
I cannot hlelp thinking of ail the fine sentiments 1 had in my mind when I spoke here
in April, 1946, just before the war was over.
Quite a number of senat ors were good enough
to suggest that copies of that speech should
be secured, not because I said anything exceptional, but because the speech expressed what
was a common view at that time, 4that there
should lie a united group of allies working and
struggling for peace. From the San Francisco
Conference to. the present time what lias
Russia. donc? By lier hostile and truculent
the United
attitude she hms frustrated

Nations; she lias d-ampened and shaken the
world's higli resolve for peace. That, I believe,
is tlie greatest crime she has committed.
Honourable senators, let us get the picture
of that oonference in the United States. There
is no more generous, spontaneous and hospitable people in tlie world than our neiglibours to the soutli, and next to tliem in those
qualities are our own people. We went to
that conference witli a feeling of warmi gratitude towards -the Russians for tlie figlit tliey
made. Wliatever else is to he said about them,
they are certainly great figliters. The delegates wlio came over f rom. the Old Country
had the samne sentiment towards Russia as we
liad. But what did we find on tlie part of
lier representatives but suspiejous and boorisli
conduct. It came to us first as a sliock,
followed by anxiety and fear mingled witli
anger and resentment, and properly so. Since
that time tliey liave persisted. ini libelous
attacks and offensive lies. Tliere is no other
way to, properly describe wli'at tliey 'have
said about our statiesmien. Wlien I say "our
statesmnen", I refer to tlie repreeentatives of
pe-ace-loving nations, particularly of Englisli
speaking nations. By their attitude the Russians have destroyed every confidence.
Honourable senators, let us consider the
vario-us conferences ithat have been held. I do
not know that 1 can name tliem in proper
order, but there were the London, Paris and
Moscow conferences, and also tlie meeting at
Lake Success. At tihe Paris conférence for
instance, nations met together to work out
something in regard to -the Marshall plan.
Wliat was the Marshall plan? Was it a design
on Russia or on any country? No; it was a
attempt to save starving
humanitarian
millions; something that, according to Churchill, Russia did not do in the Ukraine fifteen
years ago. At that conférence alie blocked -the
Marshall Plan, and she is continuing to block
it. Also, slie lias forced every one of lier
satellite nations to co-operate witli lier in
blocking tlie progress of the plan. For what
reason does she do that? Can lionourable
senators tell me of any reason, humanitarian
or otherwise, that carnies witli it any menit
or justification? A few men emerge from
behind the "iron curtain" k> block any attempt,
partieularly by the United States, k> send aid
to starving millions. From behind that "mron
curtain," which is a mystery we do not understand, nothing can escape bu.t evil and enmnity.

My honourable friend from Inkerman (Hon.
Mr. Hugessen) referred to the poisonous practice of infiltration tliat is gomng on-I do flot
use his parliamentary language-and the suggestion was made, I tliought, that if Russia
were defeated in this policy of trying to

SENATE

triumph by infiltration, possibly she would
throw up the sponge, and we could meet with
her on a common basis. I join in my honourable friend's wish that that may be so, and I
agree that everything reasonable should be
done on the assumption that the plan may
work; but I think we should hope for the best
and prepare for the worst. My suggestion,
honourable senators, is that if the Russians do
not succeed in their policy of infiltration they
will experience frustration, and frustration does
not breed contentment or make for peace;
rather, I believe, it will lead to a breaking out
of new and evil designs in another quarter.
Let me cal. .to the minds of honourable
senators the fact that penetration by Russia
has net been peaceful penetration. May I
indicate what she lias done in annexing other
countries, not merely by infiltration, but
largely by force and intimidation. She bas
annexed the following European territories:
North Finland and strategic areas of South
Finland controlling access to the Baltic.
Esthonia, Latvia, Lithuania, the northern part
of German East Prussia, the eastern half of
Poland, the eastern part of Czechoslovakia,
Bessarabia and Bukovina, and in the Far East
she has annexed Tannu, Tuvaa, Port Arthur
and the Kurile Islands. In Europe she lias
under ber military economie and political
Germany,

Poland,
domination:

Czeelcoslovakia,

course between the Russian people and the rest
of the world-the gro-wth of personal friendship
betweern individuals is frowned upon-a wall of
ignorance and suspicion is being built between
the nations.
I notice that General McNaughton in New
York last month expressed the hope-and it
is a hope that every one of us shares-that
something of our sincerity 'may find its way
I ask honourable
to the Russian people.
senators, and particularly my honourable
friend from Inkerman, how is it going to get
through the "iron curtain"? It cannot get
through by means of the newspapers, for the
press is absoluýtely controlled. It cannot get
to the people by radio, because any man who
listens te the radio in Russia has to do so
und'er government supervision. How is it
going to get beyond that iron wall which bas
been deliberately set up by the men who are
d'ominant?
I quote Mr. Attlee again. In a statement
within the past few days, he says:
Our British socialisi,-

Rumania, Bulgaria, Yugoslavia and Albania;

That statement cornes from the Prime Minister of Britain, a mild-mannered man who is
most moderate in his statements.
I attempted to get a copy of a recent speech
made by Winston Churchill in the British
Parliament; but copies of Hansard from
overseas are slow in reacching us. I did howiver find, in the New York Times of January 23, that in talking about the atonic bomb
he said, "We must come te a settlement with
Russia before it is too late". He used stronger
language, but I have net a copy of bis speech.
I think I have said enough on this point to
convince you that unless there is world cont.rol of the atomie bomb the danger is grave
that Russia will use this weapon for the
destruction of the democracies whom, without
doubt, she believes to be her enemies. I do
not want to be sensational on this subject; I
simply make the statement that that is the
situation which faces us.
So, honourable senators, we come to the
fourth question: What are we going to do
about it? I am sorry to be taking so much
tirne.

in Asia she lias outer Mongolia, Manchulria,
northern Korea and the Sinkiang province of
China. She is also trying to get control of
Greece and Turkey. I can add to the notes I
made sone months ago that today she is
trying to get control of Italy and other
countries.
Honourable senators, may I now refer 'to
some comments made by public men. Let us
take, first, Stalin himself. In the American
magazine Mercury, Max Eastman quotes
Stalin as follows:
It is inconceivable that the Soviet Republic
should continue to exist for a long period side
by side with inperialist states-ultimoately one
or the other must conquer.
I cannot read in that statement, honourable
senators, any reassurance tha.t Russia, if she
fails in her policy of propaganda, infiltration
of
her doctrines
to force
and trying
communism, will stop at that.
May I give two quotations from Mr.
Attlee? The first reads:
Freedom to the connîîrist party means the
denial of liberty to all those .who refuse to
accept the communist philosophy. One of the
tragedies of the world is that the Soviet government appears deliberately to prevent inter-

He, of course, emphasizes socialism; I would
prefer to call it British democracy-our western Europeaii socialisin lias its roots
in Europeani civilization, in humiranism, in
Christianity and, in Britain, in our British
history.
We are up against somrething which lias no
roots in the past. which indeed tries to destroy
the past and lias been bred in Russia.

Some Hon. SENATORS: No, no.

Hon. Mr. HAIG: Go ahead.

FEBRUARY 16, 1948
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: I propose to divide my
discussion of this question into two branches.
First, I shall explain what has been done, and
for this purpose perhaps I will be permitted
to read the summary I have made. I found
great difficulty in getting exact information,
because the speeches I have read do not contain a satisfactory analysis. Here is a review
of what has been going on in the past two
years.

In January 1946 the United States government set up a committee, headed by Dean
Acheson and Mr. Lilienthal. This committee,
after study and full deliberation, made very
important recommendations. They were in
substance as follows:
1. The United Nations should set up an
"international 'agency."

2. This agency to be made owners of all
sources of supply of uranium -and thorium in
all the world.
That is very important, and its importance
will be realized in a moment when I come to
discuss the proposals made by Russia.
3. Complete control of production of raw
materials, manufacturing plants, and all research to be vested in the agency, and also the
right to license non-dangerous uses.
All these are devices to give some security
to the world.
4. Full power of international inspection and
enforcement to be in the agency, backed up by
the United Nations.
If effect were given to these four proposals,
honourable senators, the result would be a
security which we have not now, and which it
looks as though we shall not have.
The Lilienthal Commission was a United
States body. Later the Security Council of
the United Nations recommended the setting
up of a United Nations Security Council Commission, and Mr. Bernard Baruch, the American representative, submitted proposals similar
in principle to the Acheson-Lilienthal recommendations. These proposaIs were supported
by the Canadian government. It was made
clear by the United States that if a commission with the backing of the United Nations
were set up and invested with these powers,
she would surrender to that commission ber
knowledge of the atomic bomb and her
supplies of the bomb, and would discontinue
its manufacture. All they asked was that the
atomic agency should be properly set up under
an agreement or treaties to guarantee its
effective operation, and that there should be
no veto. If there is one nation that we might
have expected to agree to that proposal, it is
Russia. The Russians are not in a position to
manufacture the atomic bomb. My honourable
friend from Inkerman (Hon. Mr. Hugessen)

157

has remarked that they are a tired, an exhausted people; and I think we all believe that
they do not possess as much scientific ingenuity as the people of our own countries. One
would have thought they would have hailed
such a proposal as assuring their salvation.
But what did they do? Listen to their
proposals.
First, they proposed the immediate outlawing of the manufacture and use of the atomic
bomb, and that the United States should
within three months destroy all its existing
stocks of bombs. In other words, their basis
for further negotiations is that the United
States shall first wipe out all the advantage
she has. Now listen to their second proposal.
Through Mr. Gromyko, they objected to the
ownership of uranium by the agency, and
asserted that the right of inspection and
punishment should not be in the agency, but
should vest in the government of each nation
on the "honour" system.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: Some honourable senators laugh. It is funny-so funny that, with
your permission, and without wishing to seem
frivilous, I would say it reminds me of a story
about a Jew. In telling it I cast no reflection
on the Jewish people, because one often hears
stories about the Scots, the Irish and others.
This tale happens to be about a Jew who got
into a poker game with a group of men, all of
whom were friends of one another, but to
whom he was a stranger. Next day somebody
asked him: "How did you make out in the
poker game?" He said: "It was a funny
game. It was on the honour system. They did
not show their hands; they just declared
what they had, and, threw their hands face
down in the deck". "Well", he was asked,
"how did you make out?" "Oh", he replied,
"I lost the first pot-before I knew the rules."
In that little story one secs a clue to the
menace of the greatest tragedy that bas ever
confronted the world. After all the other
nations had agreed to four propositions which
seemed to provide a solution of this menace,
so far as any solution is possible, the representatives of one nation took the stand: We
will not agree to that. The United States, the
only country which can manufacture the
bomb, must cease to manufacture it, destroy
its supplies, and leave the future to the
'honour ssytem'.
The next proposal of the Russians was that
the control and right of enforcement should
be vested in the Security Council of the
United Nations as presently constituted. This
meant, in relation to this vital question, that

SENATE

after the United States bad surrendered lier
ad%,antage, Russia would stili retain the veto
power.
The proposais of the United States and of
Russia were both referred te the Sccurity
Council Atomic Energy Commission.
On
Decembîr 31. 1946, the commission reportcd
to the Security Counicil, by a vote of 10 to 0,
substantially approving the Baruch proposais.
But Russia, and Poland under the domination
of Ruissia, did nlot vote. On March 10, 1947,
the Security Counicil refûrred the report bock
to the commission along with twelve proposed
amiendmoents by Gromyko, witb instructions
to submit a further report. On June il the
Russians submitted modified proposais. which
soundod weli but which, wbien studied, were
found to ignore or repudiate these four essentials. At the end of August, 1947, Gromyko
flatly refused these four basic principlos of
sofety control. Upon reference to the speech
cf General McNaughton I find ýthat the
Russians stili adhere to the saine position:
there is no sign of a compromise.
So, honourable senators, after txvo years the
protection of the world. agaiost a menace
more terrible thon ever before dreamed of,
is hlockcd bv the Ru >- n~
sia
J-. think we
must ask ourselves why they bave done it.
I con -sce on]y one reason. They must be
looking abead with a feeling of assurance
that the demorracies xviii nex er start a war.
ond that they can go on without fear of these
bondbs, knowing that there will be no danger
of any surprise attack from the United States.
Look at our own situation. We live aiongside the UTnited States. but we are not concerned whether she bam ten bombs or 10,000
stored in that country. We know there is
no danger of hier turning tbem on us or any
other nation unless she is forced to in the
desperotion cf a war.
1 hiaxe given vou the bistory up to date, but
whiat of tbe future? That is what we have got
to face. As 1 said in opening. I am not
bore to presumoe with solutions. One thing we
may do is put our trust in Ccd to look after
us and hiope that soonor or later Russia will
agr-ce to some sensible solution. We must do
the best we con, so for as it goes, and hope
for the best. The othor day I read a speech
that Mr. Bovin made in the British Iluse of
Commons, in which hoe dcscrilbed the provocation hoe had been under and the seîf-restraint
ho had te, exorcise from time te time in dealing with tbe Ruissians.
HoI had a consciousness of his obligation as a minister of a great
nation not te do anything. if hoe could avoid
it, te aggravate the situation, and hoe treatod

thucse people as best hoe could. Ilowever, hoe
bias net gene se far as te cenceal frem his
people what the situation is.
It seems te me the next thing te be considered is the armaing of the peace-.ioving
democracies against aggressors, and the building up of sucbi an arsenal cf destruction and
-îîch a fooet cf bombers that Russia will net
dare attack. This would be oost]y and intelerable. but it may bave te ho done.
My
bonourable friend (Hon. Mr. iHugessen) says
the Russians are tired. I road i today's
Montreal Gazette thot Drew Middleton puts
the strengtb ef the Russian standing armny at
5.750,C0O.
Thec people may starve but the
soldici-s do net. The samne article indicates
that Russia's scientiflo development is net up
te oui1-tii: l.
But she bias accoss te some
of Grno~ greot scientists, se biow long
xxiii this situation continue?
Honourable senaters, after aIl reasonable
stops have been taken, consideration bias to
ho given te whether the allies shouild get
tougbi vithi the Russions. I see that some ýtime
ago tbis man in the United States ýto wbom ýmy
bonourable
friend (Hon. Mr. Hugessen)
rofcrred, made speeches against such a policy.
Nations box e nover yet get tough with 'the
Rossions. This poliex is one to bo oonsilered
for the future. I xxant to speak very carefully
on this matter. Wbon I disicussed this question
once before, a comimunistie columnist xvrote
iliot 1 xxos a xvo-i onger. If there ouic onv
Y
l
mongcrs in Canada, they ought ýte bave thiei
heads examined. It i-. inconecivable that any
mon in this countr'v sbould ho a wior-fincnfgol,
or that hoe sbould net have the utmost borror
of war. But I do say that wo bave to consider
whetber a firro stand with Russia may ultimotely ho the onlv way te prevent war; and
when I make that stotement I do net xxant
to ho misuniderstood.
Honourable senators, if I have added sortithing te the consciousness of the 'leaders in
Canada witb respect te the greot problemns
that are to ho faced, I feel that I bave served
my purpose in this address. One tbing above
aIl el-se that Canada must do at this timo is
te mointain bier strotegir position betwcon the
United Stotes and the members of the British
Commonwealth. Unless aIl the Engii speaking democracies stand together, and co-operote
in every sense of the word in the solution of
tlhese problems, tliere is ne hope for the xvorld.
The strategie position that Canada occuipies
bc tween Great Britain on the one bond and
the United States on 'the other is more fîîlly
recognized tedoy thoin. ever before. We shoîîld
seek t.o maintain that position, and endeax'our
te make sure that good relations continue and

FEBRUARY 16, 11948
that there are na misunderstandings. Along
with the other English speaking democracies,
with their common ideals, comýmon knowledge
and common laws, we should strive for the
future welfare of the world.

PRIVATE BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. Mr. J. F. JOHNSTON movcd the
second reading of Bill C-2, an Act to incorporate Rinýker Finance Corporation.
He said: Honjourable senators, the applicants are seeing the incorporation of a company under the provisions of the Small Loans
Act, being Chapter 23 of the Statutes of
Canada, 1939.
By section 13, subsection 1 of this Act,
companies inýcorporated undeýr it are subject
to certain provisions of the Loan. Companies

Act, Chapter 28 of the Revised Statutes of
Canada, 1927. Section 27 of the Loan Cornpanies Act requit-es that the minimum capitali-

zation be not less than $250,000, and that it be
divided inýto shares of $100 each.
Aiter incorporation the provisional directors shahl continue to act until not less than
$100,000 of the capital stock bas been, bona
fide subscribed and not less than 850,000 bas
been paicl in cash. When these requirernents
have been complied with the provisional
directors may call a general meeting of shareholders for the purpose of electing permanent
directors of tthe company. When $100,000 bas
been, paid- up in respect of the capital stock
of the company, plus an- adiditional amount
te cover aillexpenses inourred in incorporation
and outstandîng obligations of the eompany,
the company snay then make application to,
the Superintende-nt of Insurance for a
licence to conduct business. Before the granting of any such licence the Superintendent of
Insurance will require a certificate from a
chartered bank te flhe effect that the company
has on deposit the sum of 8100,000, copies
of the minutes of aIl organizational meetings
of the corapany, evidence as to -the qualifications and fit.ness of the directors and such
other information as he rnay deemn desirable.
It therefore -follows that companies incorpor.
ated under the Small. Lans Act corne under
the supervision of the Superintendýent of
Insurance. Adequate safeguards are provided
in the legislation to prevent licences being
issued to a company un-less all the requirements have been fully complied witjh.
The cornpany in question is a purely commercial u'ndertaking. I have 'been. assured by
the principale that sufficient funds are now
available to, meet the min-imum requirements
of the Loan Companies Act as týo initial paid
up capitalization..
If honourable senators sec fit to pass the
motion for second reading, I shahl move that
the bill be referred to an appropriate committee for further st.udy.

BUSINESS OF THE SENATE
TARIFFS AND TRADE-MEETING
COMMITTEE

OF

On the motion to adjourn:
Hon. WISHART McL. ROBERTSON:
Honourable senators, before we adjourn I
should like to remind the house that tomorrow
morning there will bo a meeting of the
Standing Committee on Canadian Trade
Relations, to resume consideration of the
subject-matter of tle Geneva Trade Agreement. Official notices of the meeting haxve gone
out to members of the committee, but of
course it is well understood that eve ry- senator.
whether a menber of the committee or not, is

welcome to attend the meeting and to listen to
discussion or cvidence.
I should also like to say at this timc that I
haxe been giving as careful consideration as I
b iusiness is likely
can to tiie question of what
to coin before the Senate between now and
the end of March. In all likelihood some
measurts will be sent to us frou another place
during that period. and indeed some new
measures may originate here, but I do not
think there will be enough to require our full
time. Therefore, unless there is thon some
business of which I have no knowedge at the
moment, at the end of this week I shal ask
the Senate to consider adjourning for two
weeks; that is, until Monday evening, March
8. I am making this announcement in advance
in case the expected adjournment may cause a
change in the plans of some honourable
senators. Of course, I know it will be generally
agreed that if some unforeseen business
develops, we should continue sitting and
attend to it in order that the public interest
may not suffer.
Right Hon. IAN MACKENZIE: Honourable senators, may I make a reference to the
remarks of my honourable leader as to the
matter before the committee on Canadian
Trade Relations? I am not saying this in a

critical vein. I merely wish to suggest that
according to the rules of parliament, and May
and Bourinot, the motion, which was made
during my absence from this chamber, to refer
the subject-matter of the Geneva agreement
to a committee, automatically kills the resolution itself as it stands on the order paper.
The reason is that it is an elementary rule of
parliament that a resolution cannot be discussed in two places at the same time. I am
raising this point, not by way of objection
or obstruction, but simply because I think that
in future we should follow the old historie
rules of parliament instead of this procedure.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I may say to my
right honourable friend that the subjectmatter of the resolution was referred to the
Standing Committee on Canadian Trade Relations before the Christmas adjournment, and
therefore prior to his being summoned to the
Senate. As a layman, I always find myself
at some disadvantage in discussing parliaientary practice, and I am quite prepared to
trust to the judgment of those more skilled
and experienced in the matter than I am.
I do know. however, that while if Las net
liceen a general practice in the other place to
follov the procedure tîat we have followed in
titis instance, it certainly las been clone
there-my right ionourable friend, with his
long parliamentary experience, will correct me
ias been
if I am wrong-and il certainl
done before in tiis house. My right Lionourable friend savs we were out of order. I do
not know about that. But whatever may
have been the peactice in the past, I cannot
lelp thinking that in lite final analysis this
bouse should be supreme in determining its
own procedure. If the house decided upon a
certain procedure, particularly if it did so with
unanimous consent, my common sense would
tell me tbat that was all right. Should that
not be île view of honourable senators, perhaps we ouîght to have a general debate on
the whole question.
Hon. JOHN T. HAIG: Honourable members, may I be permitted to say a few words
at this time? I did net indulge to any extent
in the discussion on this subject the other day,
and I do not intend to speak at length tonight.
This question first came up in the house
during the war years, when His Honour the
Speaker was leader of the government in this
chamber and I was acting leader of the
opposition. At that time the procedure now
under discussion was followed, with the unanimous consent of the house.
When this resolution was introduced I
knew nothing at all about it. While I could
perhaps have spoken on it, in the light of

FEBRUARY 16, 1948

subsequent information my remarks might
have sounded silly. I therefore asked the
leader of the government if he would consider
having the subject-matter of the resolution
referred to a committee, and he agreed, subject to the unanimous consent of the house.
That consent, of course, was obtained.
I quite agree with the contention of my
right honourable friend that we cannot sidestep responsibility for second reading by some
subterfuge; but I feel that if the whole house
consents we can do anything. The practice of
this house, since I entered it some time ago,
has been to get at the merits of legislation
and to avoid making a decision that at a later
date might appear silly. We have, therefore,
always agreed unanimously to have certain
matters go to committee.
I was not brought up in the Parliament of
Canada, but in the place where I gained my
experience I was regarded as quite an authority on the rules. Of course I was always in
opposition; but that is where one learns about
rules. I was always taught, and my right
honourable friend knows, that rules are for
the protection of the minority; if the minority
does not object, the rules can be suspended
without hurting anybody.
When His Honour the Speaker was leader
of the government in this house, he followed
the excellent practice of referring certain subjects to a committee. My right honourable
friend was partly to blame for the situation
which confronted us. The government would
bring down its financial proposals near the
end of the session, and they would reach this
house iduring the hot weather, a day or two
before prorogation, when we had no opportunity to properly study them. The then
honourable leader of the government suggetsed that we should have a committee to
consider the estimates, so that we would have
full knowledge of the Supply Bill when it
finally came to us. That systemn worked very
satisfactorily.

The subject now under discussion is surely
a non-political one, as far as this house is
concerned. I believe that the interpretation
of the rules is a proper one. Ever since I have
been in this house, even in the days of the
honourable Mr. Meighen and the late Senator Dandurand, if the house gave its unanimous consent, we could do whatever we
liked.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: Honourable senators, a few of us studied this question about
two sessions agoThe Hon. the SPEAKER: Honourable
senators, we had a long discussion on this
subject a few days ago. At that time I made
the suggestion that if the rules were going
to be discussed a motion should be placed on
the Order Paper for that purpose.
I am sa'tisfied that the Senate has within
itself the right to refer this matter to a committee. That has been the practice heretofore.
I do not object to my honourable friend from
Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck) speaking
to the question, but I see no reason why we
should have another debate on it tonight. The
procedure is understood, and if my right honourable friend from Vancouver wants to discuss
the rules of procedure of this house, no one
knows better than he does the proper way to
do it. He should proceed under a motion.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: Mr. Speaker, I was
merely going to ask a question. We were
studying this subject two years ago, and at
that time I read Bourinot and some other
authorities, but -did not come to the conclusion
that my right honourable friend from Vancouver lias. I think he would perform a
service if he would give us the authority to
which he refers.
Right Hon. Mr. MACKENZIE: I shall be
very gladi to do that.
The Senate adijourned until tomorrow at
3 p.m.

EXPORT AND IMPORT PERMITS
REPORT

0F

ACT

MINISTER

Hon. WISHART McL. ROBERTSON:
Honourable senators, may I make reference to
a matter which wa;s drawn to my attention
yesterday by the honourable senator from
Churchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar).
It will be
remembered that I then tabled the report
of the Minister of Trade and Commerce on
the operation of the Export and Import Permits Act for the year 1947. The honourable
sehiator asked me if copies of this report would
be made available. At that moment I was not
exactly certain of the situation; but I have
ascertained since that, as regards miscellaneous
reports, the general procedure is to table them.
without having thema at once printed in full.
At the end of the session, as a rule, the Committee on Printing determines whether material
tabled should or should nlot bc printcd.
This is doue with a view, on the one hand,
of making %Il possible information available,
and on the other, (if keeping down the expense
invol'ved. In any event, I intimatedl that a
number of senators were intercsted in seeing
this report, and asked the department to
provide some mimeographied copies.
This
they did. I have furnished one copy to the
leader of the opposition (Ho.n. Mr. Haig).
one to the honourable senator frorn Churchill
(Hon. Mr. Crerar), and have had piaced. on
the table ten or twelve more copies. for the
use of honourable senators who desire to have
them. NeedILes to ýEay, other copies will bc
provided if requircd. 0f course the information contained in the report will be presented
before the committee.
DOCUMENTS TABLED
HUMAN

RIGHTS AND FUNDAMENTAL
FREEDOMS

Hon. WISIIART McL. ROBERTSON:
Honourable senators, I lay on the table correspondence
with
attorneys
general
of
provinces and, deans of l.aw schools regarding
the power of the Parliament cf Canada to
enact a national bill of rights; regulations
made under the Depart'ment of Veterans
Affairs Act;
regulations made under the
Veterane Land Act, 1942; and regulations
made under the Soldier Settlement Act. The

165

first series of documents which I am tabling
relates to. a matter which. was brought to my
attention ycsterdiay by the honourable senater from Peterborough (Hon. Mrs. Fallis).
Right Hon. Mr. MACKENZIE: I wondcr if
it would be in order for me to ask the leader
of the house, and the administration, a question about the documents tabled respecting
human rights and fundýamental freedoms, a
subjeet as to which I had the hono-ur o-f
making a motion in another place a year ago?
My question is this: Were the tbree or four
opinions received from very eminent authoritics in the various provinces of Canada-and
wbich I understand were tableà bere todayrequested by the administration, or were they
suqjmitted, vol'untarily by these eminent and
distinguisbed gentlemen?
Hon, 'Mr. ROBERTSON: 1 am not now in
a position to answer the question of my right
henourable friend. Perbaps those associated
with the joint committee, or indeed my honourable friend himself, who at that time occupied a far more prominent position than I
can
in the counicils of the government,
enligbten the bouse. At th~e moment I am not
able to do so, but I will endeavour te secure
týhis information for the right honourable
gentleman, if hie so desires.
Right Hon. Mr. MACKENZIE: I may say
that so far as my knowledge goes as a member
of the administration, no action was taken in
regard to consulting the provinces; and I
diesire to be en'ightened, in the public interest,
as to, whether these opinions were given voluntarily or werc asked for.
Hon. Mr. RýOEBUCKÇ: I had the honour,
which I regard as a very great one, of being
a member of the committee, and 1 understand that the opinions were asked for.
Right Hon. Mr. MACKENZIE:

I see.

Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: May I ask whether
copies of these documents were mimeographed?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: My reference to
imimeographing related particularly to the
report tabled yesterday on the operation of
the Export and Import Permits Act. Under
the prodding of the bonourable senator from
Peterborough (Hon. Mrs. Fallis) I moved as
rapidly as I could,; but it was not until a
few minutes ago that I rcceived the documents for which she asked, and I am not at
the moment in a position to say whether
copies are available. 1 assure my honourable
friend, however, that I shall make every effort
to, secure them.

moved:
That it is expedient that a joint committee
of both houses

of parli-ament be appointed to

consider the question of human rights and fundamental freedoms, and the manner in which
those obligations accepted by all members of
the United Nations may best be implemented;
And. in particular. in the light of the provisions contained in the Charter of the United
Nations. and the establishment by the Economic
and Social Council thereof of a Commission on
Human Rights, what is the legal and constitutional situation in Canada with respect to such
rights, and what steps, if any, it would be advisable to take or to reconmnend for the purpose of preserving in Canada respect for and
observance of human rights and fundamental
freedoins;
That the Honourable Senators Ballantyne,
Bouffard, Burchill,
Crerar, Fallis, Gouin,
Horner, Leger, McDonald (King's), Roebuck,
Turgeon and Wilson, be appointed to act on
behalf of the Senate as members of such a
conmittee.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: Is
pleasure to concur in this motion?

it

your

Hon. ARTHUR W. ROEBUCK: Honourable senators, I do not propose to discuss the
broad question, but before this resolution is
carried I should like to make an observation
on it. In the first place I wish to say that it
is a very great honour to be included in the
membership of such a committee and to be
able to express my views on the important
subject under discussion. There is, however,
a great confusion abroad as to the powers of
this committee and what it may recommend.
I do not know whether other honourable
members who sat on the committee
last year
have been subjected to tne same barrage of
organized letter-writing that reached my
office.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Lots of them.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: In any event, I
thought it worth while to bring down my file,
not by way of protest, but to show the volume
of correspondence I have received. Members

of parliament are, of course, open to receive
letters, and they should acknowledge them.
I have been able to answer every letter I
have received. But what concerns me is the
total misunderstanding of the situation on
the part of those who have written to me.
Notwithstanding some of my replies, the
same type of letter. written by hand or
typewritten, and expressing the opinion of the
writer, has continued to come into my office.
I give the writers credit for their industry,
but it seems to me that none of them attack
the real problem. They all urge the desirability of some binding law which will
prevent the dominion and provincial governments from doing something which the writers
regard as an invasion of civil liberties and
fundamental freedoms; but not a single one of
them attacks what I say is the real problem,
namely, the limitation on the constitutional
authority of this parliament to deal with
that question. So far as Canada is concerned
the power to legislate is unlimited, but it is
divided into two jurisdictions, that of the
dominion and that of the provinces. The
dominion has no more power to legislate
within a provincial jurisdiction than it has
to legislate for the state of Maine or for
Belgium or any other country. The provincial
and dominion jurisdictions
are entirely
different.
It has been suggested that the committee
recommend an amendment to the constitution
of Canada, but confusion arises from the fact
that the constitution of Canada is altogether
different from that of the United States,
where constitutional provisions are binding
upon both the federal and state legislatures.
In the United States all power flows from the
people; it is the people, rather than the
federal and state legislatures, who enact the
constitution of the United States. The power
comes from the people; therefore the people
may bind the legislatures. But the British
North America Act says that the government of Canada shall be vested in the Qucen;
and as the Queen-or the King, as the case
may be-now accepts advice from responsible
ministers who are to some extent under the
control of parliament, in this country and
other parliamentary countries-cabinet-ruled
countries, as distinguished from the United
States-the final authority vests in parliament.
And one parliament has no power to control
future parliaments, so that a bill of rights
passed by us now would be ineffective against
any other parliament, or against this parliament itself if at a subsequent date it wished
to pass legislation amending or disregarding
the bill of rights.

FEBRUARY 18, 1948
To attempt to have our British North
America Act amended so as to make it binding upon the Dominion Parliament or the
provinces would be to confess that this is no
longer an autonomous nation, but rather that
it is subject to an overriding authority without
our borders; and of course that would be
obnoxious to those who, like myself, are
intense Canadians. So I am making these
observations in the hope that my voice may
reach beyond this chamber, and may bring to
the attention of those earnest people who are
asking the Dominion Parliament for an overriding and all-embracing act, the limitations
on our ability to pass such an act.
In my replies to these numerous letters I
have endeavoured to suggest the problem,
and I have said to nearly one and all: "Have
you approached your provincial government
about joining in such a declaration? Remember, the Dominion Parliament has no authority within the provincial jurisdiction, nor has
the present parliament any power to bind
future parliaments". But I get no reply to
that suggestion. No complete bill of rights
can pass in the Dominion of Canada without
the concurrence of one and all of the provincial legislatures with the Dominion Parliament. I hope the knowledge of that fact will
spread, and that people will realize that,
irrespective of the good will which we possess,
we must have regard to practical conditions.
For my part, I desire the protection of the
civil rights and fundamental liberties of every
individual in this land. I am a believer in
the rights and dignity of the individual-these
things should be inviolate-but I want people
to understand the practical means by which
a bill of rights, if it is desirable at all, can be
brought about.
There is a distinction between a will to
observe the rights and dignities of others and
a bill to enforce them. The greatest boon that
we enjoy in this and other British countries is
the common acceptance of the principle that
everyone is entitled to live bis own life, to
express his own thoughts, and to be protected
from domination and oppression by others. If
a bill of rights will help the acceptance or the
observance of that principle, I am all in favour
of it, and so of course I am in favour of this
resolution.

The motion was agreed to.
STANDING COMMITTEES
ADDITION TO PERSONNEL

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON moved that the
name of the Right Honourable Senator Mackenzie be added to the list of senators serving
on the following standing committees of the

167

Senate. namely the Standing Committee on
Banking and Commerce, the Standing Committee on External Relations, the Standing
Committee on Tourist Traffic, the Standing
Committee on Natural Resources, the Standing Committee on Immigration.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Honourable senators, I
think the leader should have proposed that
the right honourable gentleman's name be
added to the list of members of one other
committee, namely, the Standing Committee
on Divorce, and I would suggest that that be
done.

Some Hon. SENATORS: Carried.
The motion was agreed to.
DAIRY INDUSTRY BILL
MOTION FOR SECOND

READING

Hon. W. D. EULER moved the second
reading of Bill B, an Act to amend the
Dairy Industry Act.
He said: Honourable senators well know
that this bill seeks the repeal of that portion

of the Dairy Industry Act which prohibits
the manufacture, importation and sale of
margarine in Canada. I am pressing the
bill for the third successive session for several
compelling reasons. First and foremost always
is the desire to restore to the Canadian people
the right of freedom of choice to buy butter
or margarine according to their own preference, as a matter of democratic principle, just

as they are free to choose other commodities.
Let the person who chooses to buy butter

at 73 cents a pound, or at any other price,
continue to do so; but if the wife of a working
man with a large family of growing children
can buy margarine at half the price of butter,
and desires to buy it for that reason or any
other reason, she should be permitted to do so.
That seems to me to be a fundamental frcedom of every Canadian citizen; and that
principle of freedom of choice has never in the
past two years been attacked by the opponents
of this bill; in fact, it has been carefully
avoided. My second reason for bringing in
the bill is my conviction, which has grown
stronger since the last session of parliament,
that the vast majority of Canadian people
desire the removal of the ban on this wholesome and inexpensive food. My third reason
is that since the last session there have been
some very important developments affecting
this question.
I have dealt only briefly with my first
reason because I have debated it before this
house on other occasions. Fortunately, no
one now questions the wholesomeness of mar-

SENATE

garine. Probably there is some butter that
is better than some margarine; but I am
just as sure that there is some margarine
that is better than some butter.
lion. Mr. LACASSE: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. EULER: If it were necessary to
clinch the question of the wholesomeness of
margarine, I need only refer to opinions
expressed in the Canadian Medical Journal,
ani a siilar publication in the United States,
to the effcet that in ils economic and nutritional aspects margarine is actually better
tian butter. In this respect I should like to
quote from last week's issue of Time, a publication which all will agree is reputable.
Wlitle J do net wish te de'lay the lieuse by
giving a large number of quotations, I feel
it is important that I read this short article.
It is headed "Butter v. Margarine" and reads
as follows:
Is butter superior to margarine? For years
the warring champions of butter and margarine
(made from vegetable fat-niostly soybean and
cottonseed oil) have been sneîaring each other,
despite laboratory tests on rats and mice that
showed no difference in food value. In 1946,
three Chicago physicians accepted a grant from
the National Association of Margariie Manufacturers to experiment with huinan beings.
The doctors picked two orphan asyluns where
diets could be strictly controlled. In one institution, 100 children w-ere given only margarine
-for bread, on vegetables and in pastry and
frying. In another institution, of 107 children,
butter was used.
Last week the doctors reported the results
of the two-year test in the Journal of the
American Medical Association. There was no
real difference between the two groups of children-in height, weight. or hemoglobin and red
cell count. General health seemed to favour
the margarine boys and girls, but the doctors
cautiously credited "other variables". Their
conclusion: "Whether the greater part of the
fat of the diet is derived from vegetable or
animal sources bas no effeet on grow-th and
health. . . Margarine is a good source of table
fat in growing children . ."

That statement, I think, should dispose of the
contention as to whether or net margarine is
wholesome. As I said before, it is no longer
in question.
Now, with regard to my second reason, I
should like to give some evidence in support
of my conviction that the demand by the
public for the removal of this ban is growing
very rapidly. I have received letters from
literally hundreds of individuals from coast
to coast-ranging from clergymen, doctors and
lawyers to people in all walks of life-all in
faveur of margarine. True, two years ago I
received a resolution from the Dairy Council
of Canada and from the Federation of Agriculture protesting against the removal of the

ban on margarine; but this year it is rather
remarkable to note that up until two weeks
ago I had not received a single communication from an individual who was opposed to
margarine. Further, I have received resolutions from women's organizations, soldiers'
organizations, and church organizations; from
labour unions in large numbers and from
boards of trade; from municipal councils,
hospitals and restaurants, all demanding margarine. One day about three weeks ago I
received from the Niagara district no fewer
tlan 54 letters in one mail. True, they were
accumulated as a result of a broadcast by
some person in that district asking for opinions on margarine. However, these communications were foiwarded te me. I do not propose to take up the time of the bouse by
reading them all, but a few seen to be rather
important, and to give a cross-section of the
typical fceling of women throughout the
country. 1 am quite prepared to place these
letters on the Table, if I am requested to
do so. First, a lady writes as follows:
I am writing to let yen know that J think
we should have margarine. I have seven children ( the oldest is twelve) and believe nie it
is a probleni to give them all the bread and
butter they want at the present prices. I can
see no reason why I shouldu't have the choice
of giving them whichever I think I eau afford.
When I visit seme of my American relatives,
they have margarine, and I can't see any difference in the taste of it and butter. What's good
enough for the rest of the world is good enough
for Canadian families too.
Another lady writes:
T .am writing te tell yen that I too think that
the price of butter is too higli, and I would
very miuch like to be able to buy margarine 1m
place of butter. We have eight ehildren and
we just can't afford to buy all the butter that
is necessary for thîem, so we use just as little
butter as possible, so here is ny vote for
margarine.
A further letter reads:
I take pleasure in joining the crusade for
margarine. It is a national disgrace that poor
children have to subsist on lard and beefdripping where the family cannot afford butter.
I used margarine in 1917 and found it a very
satisfactory substitute, and quite palatable.
In countries where it is used, there does not
appear to be any hardship to the dairy interests.
In fact, where there is a shortage of butter,
such a substitute is a necessity, regardless of
the difference in price.
Still another letter reads:
I cannot afford to buy butter at its present
price and am one of the many who would like
te have the ban lifted froi the margarineor sbould my children eat their bread without?
We had to cut off a number of foods in order
to have the main items-meat and vegetablesso why take any more? We want either margarine or a lower butter price.

FEBRUARY 18, 1948

I have one further letter from that series
that I should like to read. It says:
I am just writing a note to add my name to
those who would like to see margarine sold in
Canada. We have four children, ages five to
twelve

years,

and

I

just cannot

afford

the

proper amount of butter for them at the price
it is today.
I have a cousin in Buffalo with a family of
six. Three of ber children whien they come ýto
Canada will not eat bread here because they
dont like butter. She bas both butter and
margarine on the table at all meals. I have
eaten the margarine and can see no difference
between it and butter.
If we cannot have margarine then we will
have to find something else to take the place of
butter, or force its price down within the reach
of the workingman's pay.
I have before me a letter which also is
typical, but which perhaps expresses my views
better than I can myself. It is from Mr.
Edward A. Hall, Clerk of the Corporation of
the Township of York, which is near Toronto. It reads:
Dear Mr. Euler:
I am instructed by Council to extend to you
its thanks and appreciation for your efforts to
secure amending legislation which will permit
the manufacture and sale of oleomargarine in
Canada.
I am not reading the letter because of the
first sentence, but because of what follows.
The Council of the Township of York represents over 85,000 citizens, and it is very strongly
of the opinion that the present legislation
which prevents the competition of another
wholesome product with butter cannot possibly
be justified at any time, but particularly in
view of the present excessive price which consumers are required to pay for butter.
Mr. Hall sent a similar letter to the Minister
of Agriculture, and apparently received a reply
from him explaining the situation. He did not
send me a copy of that reply, but I have a
copy of what he wrote afterwards to the
Minister. It reads:
Hon. James G. Gardiner,
Minister of Agriculture,
Ottawa, Canada.
Dear Sir:
I have your letter of the 26th instant and
wish to thank you for the comprehensive explanation of the situation with respect to the
problems arising out of the sale of butter.
While the question of the sale of oleomargarine bas been brought to the fore by
reason of the very high price of butter, it is
not solely by reason of this fact that Couneil is
urging the government to withdraw the ban on
the manufacture and sale of oleomargarine.
The Council feels that to prohibit the manufacture and sale of one product in order to benefit
the producer of another produot is quite unjustified. It feels that the consumers of the
country should be entitled to choose between
oleomargarine and butter just as freely as they

can use their discretion in the purchase of other
commodities, and it

is accordingly hoped that

169

the government vill take the necessary legislative action at the present session to accomplish
this.
He makes the argument, I think, better than
I have made it.
Here is a letter which I received only today:
Dear Mr. Euler:
I happen to be Associate Secretary of the
General Board of Religious Education of
the Anglican Church, and I am writing to ;thank
you sincerely for the unceasing effort you are
making to get margarine manufactured in Canada . May I express the hope that you will not
rest in this matterI shall not rest very much.
-until parliament makes such production legal.
One wishes only well to a great and important
industry such as the dairy industry in our
dominion, but no interest should be allowed to
stand between the will of the Canadian people
and the carrying out of that vill.
I will read just one more letter. This is
from the Kitchener-Waterloo Branch, No. 50,
of the Canadian Legion, and is addressed to
me. It says:
We thought it might be of interest to you to
know that this zone of the Canadian Legion,
which takes in eleven branches in places such as
Stratford, Guelph, Galt, etc., passed a resolution at a recent zone meeting appealing to the
government to allow the use of margarine.
This resolution was forwarded through our
regular Legion channels, and will be passed on
through our dominion command in Ottawa.
There is perhaps no better indication of the
feeling of the people of our country than is
reflected in the newspapers from coast to
coast. While I do not read al the papers,
I may say that in only one newspaper, about
a year ago, have I found an attack-and a
very mild one-on the use of margarine. I
will mention the names of some of these
newspapers: they came to me in the ordinary
course of events, for I have no clipping service, and in no case was their editorial support solicited by me. They include: the Vancouver Sun, the Regina Leader-Post, the
Saskatoon Star-Phoenix, the Winnipeg Free
Press, the Winnipeg Tribune, the Windsor
Daily Star, the Fort Erie Times-Review, the
Brantford Expositor, the Toronto Daily Star,
the Toronto Globe and Mail, the Toronto
Telegram, the Toronto Saturday Night, Maclean's magazine, the Financial Post, the
Peterborough Examiner, the Kingston WhigStandard, and the Ottawa Citizen-as well as
a resolution passed by the corporation of the
city of Ottawa in favour of oleomargarinethe Montreal Herald, the Montreal Daily Star,
the Montreal Gazette, the Montreal Standard,
the Quebec Chronicle-Telegraph, the Halifax
Herald, and the Sydney Post-Record. I am
pretty sure that the same attitude is taken
by many others that I do not know of.

FEBRUARY 18, 1948

Hon. Mr. EULER: I do not mind if we
inject some humour into this discussion, but
my friend said in an interview in the Winnipeg Tribune that he had a great deal of
consideration for the farmer. He also said,
"While I have a great deal of consideration
for the farmer, the consumer also has some
rights." That statement has almost led me
to hope against hope that he feels now that
the consumers are deserving of consideration,
and that he perhaps will support my bill.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: J spoke two years ago.
I did not speak last year, so you still ought
to have your hopes.
Hon. Mr. EULER: I recall that my friend
did not speak on the bill last year; neither
did he vote for it.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Oh, no.
Hon. Mr. EULER: In the United States
there is a similar situation with variations.
I have said that Canada is the only country
in the world that prohibits margarine, and so
far as I know that is true. Although they do
not prohibit the manufacture of margarine in
the United States, some states have restrictions against it. For instance, in some states
they put a tax of 10 cents a pound on the
margarine if it is coloured to look like butter.
In some other states they collect a very heavy
licence fee from the wholesalers and retailers
of margarine. The tax in the state of Pennsylvania was attacked as being unconstitutional and in restraint of trade, and was disallowed in the courts. They still have their
difficulties in the United States, and last year
there were actually no fewer than five bills in
Congress directed towards the repeal of federal
restrictions against margarine. The fight is on
again now.
Hon. A. L. BEAUBIEN:
restrictions.

Some are state

Hon. Mr. EULER: Yes, but there are also
federal restrictions. I should like to read an
extract from The Christian Science Monitor,
one of the most reputable papers in the
United States. It is as follows:
Margarine is vegetable fats and oils prepared
by a chemist in such a way as to satisfactorily
take the place of butter, which is also vegetable fats and oils that have been put through a
cow. The chemist's product equals the cow's
product in nutritive values, and is less wasteful
of raw materials, such as much-needed grain,
etc. It is a step in advance of the older, more
laborious process.
Senator Fulbright of Arkansas bas introduced
a bill to end discriminatory federal taxation
that now restricts the manufacture and sale
of margarine. Many states have similar laws
which need attention. For instance, the better
margarines-those on which the chemists have
spent the most time and effort to make them

171

satisfactory as butter substitutes-can be
secured in the State of Washington only by
signed special orders paid in advance. But
across the line in Oregon this product is sold
freely.
At present prices many families find it necessary to economize on butter and milk. Would
not such families be better fed if they bought
margarine in place of butter, and used the
savings to buy more milk?
Shouhd we not ask our congressmen to give
Senator Fulbright's bill their support? Also,
we can let our state legislators know that we
wish these outmoded restrictions on the free
sale of margarine removed.
That is a nation that has margarine. They at
least have it; but we have not got to first
base so far as having it is concerned.
There is an editor's note to that article
which reads:
Most margarine is naturally yellow. It is
bleached white to conform to the laws which
require an uncoloured product.
Now I wish to read from another reputable
United States paper, -the New York Times,
of December 20, 1947. It says:
For sixty-one years, ever since 1886, the sale
of margarine has been conducted under the
handicap of restrictive and discriminatory law.
Dairy and farm interests, affecting a tearful and
altruistie concern for the consumer's welfare,
have managed to block at almost every step the
efforts made through the years to lift this yoke
laid down in federal and state law. Now
Senator Fulbright of Arkansas is determined to
try again. He bas introduced a bill to repeal
all federal taxes on margarine on grounds that
they are "directly opposed to the spirit of free
enterprise." He secs these taxes and licence
fees as the only levy made on a domestic product for the benefit of a competing product.
I hope honourable senators can see the
parallel.
The extract continues:
With butter at about $1 a pound retail; with
hospitals, schools and other institutions struggling to keep their heads above water because
of high prices, and either forced by law to serve
no margarine, or otherwise handioapped in its
use; with some states barring entirely the sale
of coloured margarine; with the people of low
income, who are the heaviest users of margarine, bearing the chief burden of the unjust,
discriminatory tax-surely this is the time to
stop listening to the sob stories of the interests
fighting margarine and to begin listening to the
people as a whole.
Perhaps that is putting it a little more vigorously than I do.
I have another article here which states
that the Canadian hospitals are now appealing to be permitted the use of margarine.
Surely we need have no fear as to the wholesomeness of margarine if our hospitals are
demanding its use.
I should' like to make reference to another
article for the benefit of my good friend from
Queen's (Hon. Mr. Sinclair).
I think the

SENATE

people of the littie island are rather opposed
to margarine because they are largely engaged
in dairying. A little paper called the Island
Farner, which was brought ta my notice the
other day, gives the menu for a Monday.
I xviii, just, read what was provided for dinner. Here it js:
Left-aver chicken fricassce with ehiopped bardco4okýed eggs on toast. canned peas, baked potatocs, sliced toniatoes, eiiriched bread, fortified
nmargarine, baked cinnannoil apples, top) milk,
cofftc. îniik.
I think rny friend wili bave ta take that
litilýe paper ta task. 1 have many more
quotations of the saine nature, but I shall fot
burden the bouse with them.
I havec statcd that aitnang roy ieasons for
bringiog this bill before parliament again wcre
certain new dcvclopmcnts which have arisen
sin ce the last session of parliamnent. Naturally
the first of these is the shocking increase in
the price of butter and other foodýs. Surely
it is indefcnsible ta, deny ta the people of
this country ane smnall mcthod, of cutting down
the cost of living. I do not know iwhat fair
reply can be given ta the millions of consumers in this country. There hav e hemn
shortages of butter for ten years at least, and
there will always be shortages. 1 was amused
somie.weeks ago when the presidenit of anc of
the dairy organizations-I think it, was in the
province of Alberta-madýe a naive suggestion
that the people of Canada could cure this
shortage themselves. He said that it was
entirely ini their own hands: "Why elon't they
eat less butter?" In other wordýs, by having
less you have more, I suppose. I wonder if
it ever occurred ta that gentleman that when
people cannot, find a -certain commodity they
would like, or cannot, afford to, buy it,' they
very naturally go and buy anything else that
thoy cao get for a substitute. If a farmer
cannot afford to huy a tractor, I suppose hie
reverts ta the use of the horse and plow, and
so on. Would yen prevent, a man fromn buying
a Ford or a Chevrolet because he cannot
afford ta buy a Buick car or a Cadilîse? If
hie cannot afforrL ta boy a fur coat for bis
xife, would you make it impossible for her
ta get one made of clotb?

who wanted them? And if a person cannot
afford ta buy beefsteak, should there be any
law probibiting him from buying humbler kinds
of ment, pcrhaps, sueh as sausage or liver?
No ane watîld dream of witholding freim the
people of Canada the righr ta boy a substitute
for any otlier comimodity th-an butter.
Sa we caine right back ta the demo-cratie
right, of frcedom of choirce. That is, as I said
before, a right that hias not been denicd in
principle, and cannot lie denicd. Whethcr it
shaîl be set aside, in order ta serve whait sanie
înay regard as an overriding special intercst,
inust ho the rcsponsibility of cx ery senator.
As for myself. I ean sec no justification whatever for the- violatioo of thjat undaubted
dcrnoeratic righit of frccdomi of chaire that
applics in aIl other demiocr-atie coaintries. and
in Canada applies ta aIl commodities except
margarine. I say without reservation that this
prahibitory law is bad; it is unjust; it is subversive of liberty; and there is no sýuch law
10 any other country.
I should hike n0W ta came ta some new
developmcnts wlîich I am sure are of extremie
interest ta ail of us. First, there are the trade
I can well
agreements made at Geneva.
remnember that twa yeýars ago, when a ýconference at Geneva of rnany of the prominýent
trading nations of the world was mooted, it
wý%as
said that one of the principles upan which
the conference would be fotînded was that no
cauntry entering into any agreement could
al)solutely han the importation of produets
of any other mcmiber-country, and that if any
nîember-country had a definite ban upon the
importation of a commodity fromn another
miembcr-country, that ban wauld have ta, be
removed. I recaîl very well that the leader
of the government (Hon. Mr. Robertson) and
my friend from. Queen's (Hon. Mr. Sinclair)
ad-vanccd, as a reason for rejeeting my bill in
1946, the argtumen.t that if the nations, including Canada, arrived at an agreement at
Geneva. margarine would therehy automatieally become available ta tlîe people of ýCanada.
If I am misquoting my honourable friends,
tlîey are here and cao correct me.

Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: There are different
grades of cars and of coats, but net of butter.

Hon. Mr. ROBERTS ON: I think that wbat
my honaniable friend says is rigbt, except
that it was last year.

Hon. Mr. EUTLER: But there is sometbing
tb-xt is just as good as butter. If a woman
cannot affard ta buy silk stockings, or if, as
w-as the case seime time aga, thcy were not
available, would you prevent bier from. obtaining woollen or cotton staekings? I admit that
these are nut nearly as attractive as silk; but
would you probibit their purcbase by anyone

Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: That was in 1947.

Hon. Mr. EULER: I thought it was the
x-ear before. The further argument was made
hy the senator from Qucen's-an argument
that I took for what it was worth, althougb
as I said at the time I did flot bave a great
di-al of confidence in it-that it would be
unwisc ta remove the ban on margarine at

FEBRUARY 18, 1948

the time, because we could use that as a bargaining factor in getting some concessions
from other countries, particularly, I think, the
United States. There was very little expee'tation, I think, in this country or elsewhere,
that out of that conference of some twentyfive or twenty-six countries at Geneva agreements would emerge.
But to everybody's
satisfaction that did happen, and Canada is
one of some eight countries that have signed
definite agreements. These agreements place
upon Canada the absolute obligation to repeal
the ban on the importation of margarine.
When I say that I am speaking by the book.
At the meeting of the Committee on Capadian Trade Relations on December 17 last
we had present as witnesses Mr. H. B.
McKinnon, Chairman of the Tariff Board,
Mr. J. J. Deutsch, Director of Economie Relations, Department of Finance, and Mr. H. R.
Kemp, Director of Commercial Relations
Division, Department of Trade and Commerce. In the course of the hearing questions
were put, and answers made, as follows:
The CHAIRMAN: Is this not the situation
with regard to oleo-margarine, in which I am
slightly interested?
Hon.
right.

Mr.

MacLENNAN:

"Slightly"

is

Hon. Mr. EULER: There were these questions and answers:
The CHAIRMAN: Is this not the situation
with regard to oleomargarine, in which I am
slightly interested: the prohibition against the
importation of margarine rwill have to be
removed?
Mr. DEUTSCH: That is right.
The CHAIRMAN:
But Canada has the
right-and I am told it will be exercised-to
put a prohibitive tariff against oleomargarine.
Mr. DEUTSCH: The rate on oleomargarine
was ut bound, and therefore we .are free to
do what the government decides about the rate
on maigarine; but so far as the prohibition is
concerned, this general agreement will not permi-t the continuance of the prohibition on oleomargarine.
I think that answers the question pretty well.
But frankly, I was rather surprised to read
the question asked in another place by the
leader of the opposition, Mr. Bracken. It was
this:
I wish to direct a question to the Prime
Minister. It arises out of the fact that we
have on the order paper a bill to amend the
Dairy Industry Act with regard to oleomargarine. My question is this. Did the government in signing the Geneva trade agreements
agree to remove the embargo against the importation of oleomargarine?
The Secretary of State for External Affairs
answered the question, but I must say his
answer was so very technical that I was not

173

able to follow it. Neither was Mr. Bracken,
who asked this further question:
Might I ask him what was the intention of
the government with respect to the embargo on
margarine when this agreement was signed?
The speaker declared that question out of
order, but I can answer it. I know, as a
matter of fact, that our negotiators at Geneva
very definitely, and I presume on instructions
from the government, asked the representatives
of the other countries, signatories to the agreements, to except margarine from the list of
commodities upon which the ban must be
removed, and those other countries refused
unanimously. Our negotiators then acceded to
the terms of the resulting agreements. I
contend that our representatives at Geneva
definitely and in good faith agreed to accept
the obligation to repeal the ban on the
importation of margarine, and I must admit
that I was just a bit taken aback by the
explanation given in another place that legal
officers of the Department of Justice were
now looking about to find whether we really
were obliged to repeal the ban on margarine.
I hope they do not find any technical reason
why we do not have to live up to our
obligation; and even if they do find one, I
hope that we shall still live up to our undertaking, which was given in good faith by our
negotiators and accepted by those of the
countries with which we made the agreements.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I think the honourable
gentleman misunderstood what was said in
the other place. The meaning I took from it
was that the government were not asking for
an opinion as to whether we could get out
from under the Geneva agreement, but as to
whether a customs duty could be imposed
against margarine.
Hon. Mr. EULER: That is not as I understand it. The tariff is another matter. I was
about to come to that question. I can say
now that there is no doubt that the government can put a prohibitory tariff against margarine if it so desires.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: Can it do that under
the spirit of the agreement?
Hon. Mr.
question.

EULER:

That

is

another

Hon. Mr. HAIG: That was my thought.
Hon. Mr. EULER: I asked that question
of one of the officiale of the Department of
'Trade and Commerce-I think it was Mr.
Deutsch-and lie replied that the government,
despite the fact that the ban had to be
removed, had the right to impose a tariff. I
presume there is no limit as to the height of

SENATE

that tariff; it might be an absolutely prohibitive tariff. In my opinion, and in reply
to my friend's question, that would be entirely
contrary to not only the spirit of the agreement but the principles of the party to which
I belong-and this is not a party question.
I was about to suggest that if the government are submitting a question to the Department of Justice as to whether the law banning
the import of margarine from other countries
must be repealed, they might at the same
time ask the department or the Supreme
Court whether the law as it now stands is
constitutional. I am informed by very sound
legal authority that this law couild not stand
the test in the courts, because it is an invasion
of provincial jurisdiction in the matter of
property and civil rights. My friend, the
Iader opposite. mai- have some opinion on
that point. But I do think that if the matter
were submitted to the Department of Justice,
or to any cormpetent court of law, the whole
matter mnight be settled right there, by haiving
the present prohibitory law declared invalid.
In all this nothing is said about the inanufacture of nirgarine in Canada. I have no
particular objection ta a tariff beim placed
on its inporiation, buecause I should like ta

representatives of Newfoundland were in
Canada conferring with representatives of this
countrv as to the terms upon which Newfounland might coie into the federation as

finally reached where the Canadian Government made a definite offer to Newfoundland.
I assume that Newfoundland, should she become a province of Canada, would be subject
te the laws of Canada. It is well known that

quality of margarine. As the law of Canada

now prohibits the manufacture of margarine
in this country, Newfoundland, upon becoming
part of this country, would have to close its
margarine factories. Moreover, clause 121 of
the British North America Act distinctly provides that the products of any province in the
dominion may pass freely into any other
province. Yet we have in this offer to Newfoundland-we might call it a white paper,
because it was officially issued by the government-a clause 21 which reads:
Notwithstanding anything contained in the
Dairy Industry ActThat is the Act which I am trying to have
amended.
-or any other Act of the Parliament of Canada, oleomargarine and other substitutes for
butter muay continue to be manufaetured and
soll in Newfoundland after union unless prohibited or restricted by the Parliament of Canada at the request of the Legislatuire of NewfouinlIandSuch a request would never come from Newfoundland.
provided that notwithstanding anything
contained in section 121 of the British North
America Act, 1867, no such oleonargarine or
other substitute for butter niay be exported
froui the Province of Newfouidland to any other
part of Canada except by authority of the
P'aliaient of Canada.
I liesitate ta say tlis, but it looks as thougli

by iriefusing ta allow Newfoundland ta export

Hon. Mr. FARRIS: Perlaps it iN inteunded
that the B.N.A. Act be amended.
Hon. Mr. EULER: Very well; but if the
British North America Act is changed, what
will lappen? It will mcan tiat one province
in Canada can make a product that is not
permitted in any of the otlier provinces;
further, it will mean the setting up of arbitrary
lines between the provinces. If that can be
done with respect to Newfouadland, what is
to prevent the Province of Ontario setting up
a tariff wall against the Province of Quebec or
the West or any other part of Canada, restricting their products, and tlius, to my mind,
destroying almost entirely the very spirit on
which confederation was formed?
I admit some hesitation in making these
remarks, but I wish that the government
would take their courage in their hands, and
without fear of any possible results would
repeal this law, which is so unfair to the consumers of Canada. No such fear is well
founded, in any case.

FEBRUARY 18, 1948
The argument against margarine bas now
been reduced almost entirely to its compassionate aspects. A few weeks ago, on -the invitation of a ladies' organization in the city of
Montreal, I bad the pleasure of debating this
subi ect. Mr. Hannam, whom I arn tempted
to caIl "the sob-sister of the Canadian Federation of Agriculture," was on hand to take the
other side. We also h-ad with us a doctor who
is an expert on nutrition at one of the Montre-al hosptals. I made very mucli the ame
argument in favour of margarine as I have
madle on ot'her occasions. Mr. Hannam spoke
quite movingly about the difficuities of the
farmers and the high cost of making butter,
which, while regrettable, really has no bearing
on the matter at ail. He concluded hîs remarks
with this statement: "Ail other commodities
have protection; why flot butter?" I had the
privilege of reply. I said: "Butter bas tariff
protection today of 12 cents per pound; but
wh*en you taik of protection- for ail other oommodities you arc flot thinking of agricuiturai
implements, for which there is no protection
at ail." Then I made this comment-and I
leave it to, the judgment of the bouse whether
it is flot perfectly fair-"jYou cannot compare
things whicb are not comparable."
"Protection" in Canada has always meant
tariff protection against foreign goods. But this
prohibitory law is flot protection at ail in the
ordinary sense; it is prohibition of the production of goods9 within Canada itself, prohibition of competition of Canadians against
Canadians. T-here is no commodity except butter which has that kind of protection in this
country.
Hou. Mr. ASELTINE: Is a copy of that
broadcast available?
Hon. Mr. EULER: I think I can give my
friend a copy.
Let me now deal with the objection which
is based on a fear that the farmer-or rather
the dairy interests, for I do flot beiieve the
farmer is affected-would be ru.ined. It is my
contention that the farmer can seil aIl the
milk and butter and cheese and cream he can
produce. We now have this extraordinary
situation. In the United States the price of
butter bas always been higher than in Canada,
yet. there they have competition from margarine; in Canada butter bas always been
lower in price, though it has no comipetition
from margarine. Now, under the Geneva trade
agreement, butter 'will have a tariff protection
in the UJnited States of only 7 cents per
pound. If, as bas not happened in ten years,
there should be a surplus of butter in Canada,
it is quite possible that butter could be
5853-13

exportcd to the United States over the
extremely moderate tariff wall of 7 cents a
pound.
The use of margarine bas not ru.ined farmers
in any other country. It bas not ruined them
in Denmark, relatively the greatest butterproducing country in the world; it bas not
ruined themn in Great Britain; nor in tbe
United States, where, as I bave said, the
price of butter bas always been bigher than
elsewhere, and is even now in the neighbourbood of 90 cents a pound, altbough you can
buy the best quaiity of margarine for from
40 to 42 cents a pound..
Before I conclude my remarks I sbould
like to make wbat I regard as a very important statement. Every ingredient of margarine
can bc produced on the Canadian farm. I
make this statement on the highest scientific
autbority in this country. In Britain they
use the oil of the peanut, or, as they caîl it,
the ground nut. I amn told the sa-me is triie
on the continent. In Newfoundland they use
whaic nil and seai oil, refined-strangely
enough-in the city of Toronto and exported
to Ne.wfoundland, where tbey make it into
margarine, although we in this country cannot do so. In the United States the ingredient most largely used is, I believe, cottonseed ail. Soybean oul and sunflower seed oul
are aiso used. In Canada, of course, we have
no cottonseed ail, but there need be no
shortage of vegetabie oul. In Manitoba last
year tbe production of sunflower seed was
doubled, and $48 worth was taken from each
acre under cultivation. We can produce an
abundance of sunflower seed, soybeans, rapeseed and.-if you like to put it in our margarine-milk. I 'repent that I have scientific
authority for the assertion that excellent
margarine can be manufactured right here in
Canada froro the products of the Canadian,
farm.
Our farmers-I say this in no spirit of
criticism--eomplain that it costs at ieast 67
cents a pound to produce butter. Sureiy that
is no reason why the man who cannot afford
to pay that much for bis butter should be
deprived of the opportunity of buying an
excellent substitute. And if the Canadian
farmer can supîply at a remunerative price the
ingredients for making margarine, we can
establisb in this country an inckistry which
not only will be beneficial to au-r consumers,
but will benefit the farmer himself by providing him with a new and substantial source of
revenue.
,May I say in conclusion that 1 have tried
ta present the case for margarine fairly and
with reason-able moderation. The question

of margarine may ba regarded, by some as
relatively trivial compared witb the great
probleme that confront Canada, but there is
a vital demnocratic principla invol:ved whicb
should not be ignored. In view of that, and
of the immediate difflculty of our people ini.
meeting the high cost of living; in furthar
view of the certain embarrassment which
must arise -from the ter.ms of the Ganeva
agreements andL of the offer to Nawfoundland,
and the genuine doubt as to, the validity of
this prohibitory law, which reputable constitutional lawyers say is ultra vires of this parliam-ent, in' that it invades the civil and
property rights of the provinces, I appeal
to -the members of thiis chamber tû do what
they can to restora te the millions of Canadieu consumers a right which is not denied
to the people of any other country in the
worlcl.
Right Hon. Mr. 'MACKENZIE: May I be
permitted on second rading to ask a question, of the honourable senator who has just
fin'ished speaking? Ha is a vary old' and tried
and trusted friend of mine, and ha has made,'
I think, an excellent address. My question is
pure]y factuel. Would he ba prepared to
inscrt in his suggestedi legislation a clause to
provide that where the effect of the introduction of oleomargarine is proved to, be
substantially damaging to the Canadian dairy
indust'ry there sho.uld ha regulations made
for the protection of that industry?
Honi. Mr. EULER: My answer to the
,senator would ha that I do not believe anything eau override the definite right of the'
Canadian people to use whatever they choose.
Hon. Mr. COPP: If I may ba permitted, I
would ask the honourable gentleman a question, solely for purposes of information. I
have enjoyed his remarks and appreciate the
great amount of information ýha has given
the house. Ha bas ex'plained to, uls that mergarine is made from pure oils; that it is as
nutritious as, or aven, more n'utritýioýus than
butter, and just as attractive. Why have it
coloured -to look like butter?
Hou. Mr. EULER: For the reason that tha
more attractive you can make eny produet tha
battier; for the same reason that oe would
sooner sit down te a table furnished, witb a
fine linen table-cloth, good' silver and ail the
rest of it. Sucb a settiu'g may make poorlycookad food more palatable than, good food
sarved in an inferior way.
Hon. Mr. COPP: I do flot know why colour
improvas the taste of margarine.

Hon. Mr. EULER: Would net the senator
rether have margarine if it was colourad like
butter?
Hon. Mr. COPP: No.
Hon.. Mr. EULER: Wall, that is whara wa
diffar.

Hon. C. C. BALLANTYNE:

Honourabla

senators, wve have listaued to, a very informative speech on margarine, and I arn sure it
wvil1 be helpful to every member of this hou-se.
I shall fot delay you et any great leugth in
speaking ou this important bill, but I desire
to make it abundantly clear that in what I
Say I arn axprassiug my own viaws, sud that
tbey do not bind my party in auy way.
As honourable senators well know, thera
are twu schools of thought in regard to this
bill. Ou the oua sida ara the dairy iuterests,
and on the other the great mass of the people,
particularly those of the poorer classes.
It bas ofteu beau stated hare thet oue of
the fundameutal duties of the Senate of
Canada is to proteet minorities, but this
aftaruoon I hope my ramarks will ha takan as
being lu the interast of the majority. I do
not dlaim to ba a fermer, but I was boru ou
a srnali farm rot fer from here, sud at the
age of fiftaen moved- ta Montieal, wbere I
have lived avar since. Years ago my late
brother and I bought a dairy farm, sud for
thirty odd years we did our best te run it;
but because wa wer gettiug old sud farm
labour was difficult te obtein, we had to sal]
our bard.
I kuow of no class of people iu Canada
that lad such a slavish lifa as those who own
and oparate e dairy farm. They rise when it
is bardly daylight sud t'bey work until dusk.
Whether their cows are milkad by baud or by
machines, there are always the chores of
wasbing up sud keeping the cow barns sanitary. The otan who looks after the bard bas
to kuow bis business. Tharefora, I find no
feuit with the fat that butter is uow selling
at 71 or 73 cants. After aIl, the agricultural
people of this country bave ju'st as much right
te make a profit on their produets as have
aged in the rnanufacturing
those wbo ara
business.
Hou. Mr. HORNER: Hear, heur.

Hon.

Mr.

BALLANTYNE:

Honourabla

senators, I thiuk it will ha quite soe tima
before we Cen reasonably axpeat to buy butter
at as low a prica as it sold for twenty years
ago. Before the lest world war $40 a mouth,
with board, was considered a very good wage
for a bîred man. Now ha receives from $3 te
$5 a day. Farmers cannot afford te pay thair
belp the wagas demandad, and they are faced

FEBRUARY 18, 1948
with a greatly increased cost of feed. For
these reasons, as I have said before, I amrnft
going to criticize the present price of butter
-and 1 do nlot expect it to be much lower
for some time. Canada experts a certain
amount of butter, but for several years now
our dairymen have been unable to take care
of this country's requirements; and we are
entering a period when butter will be even
more scarce. That is the dairymen's case.
Now let us turn to the need for oleomargarine. In every city and town froin one end
of this country to the other, thousands upon
thousanda of young, undernourished people
need vitamins and fats. May I be pardoned
for referring to my own city of Montreai?
It is something I seldomn do. Montreal is
over 300 years old and has many crowded and
narrow streets. Some dwellings are as oid as
fifty or seventy-five years, and in seine parts
of the city the second storeys of houses are
reached by outside staircases. Most Canadian
cities and towns have grass plots for the
chiidren to play on. That is nlot so in Montreal. Our chiidren play in the streets unless
they can get to a public park, and it is the
piight of the pale and emaciated children I
have seen as I have driven through the great
city of Montreal which prompts me to support the bill presented by my honourable
friend from Waterloo (Hon. Mr. Euler).
I do nlot want to injure the dairy industry;I would be the last man to do so; but I amn
firmly convinced-I may be wrong-tbat oleomargarine will nlot affect it at ail. I feel there
ia a place in Canada for ail the butter the
dairy industry can produce, and I hope those
engaged in it will make a reasonable margin
of profit. But there ia also a large demand for
oleomargarine.
I have had to decide for myseif which side I
would take in this matter, and really, honourable senators, in ail conscience I could
flot vote against a messure that would remove
the ban on margarine. After ail, our young
children and aur aider people need nourishment. Neyer have the people of Canada
lived under such deplorable conditions as we
have today. As a result of the two world wars,
living accommodation is over-crowded and
the prices of everything are away up. When
it cornes to getting butter, Canadians cannot
really afford to buy it-which is flot to be
wondered at with the price at 72 or 73 cents
a pound-so they have to do with very littie
or with none at ail.
I feel that anything I can do to prevail
upon the goverfiment to -remove the ban on
margarine in Canada wiil be of assistance to
a large majority of people, who are in dire
need. I do nlot know that there is much more

to be said. The honourable senator who
introduced the bill covered the ground very
fuily. He pointed out-quite significantly, I
think-that the two large dairy countries,
Denmark and the United States, manufacture
and consume margarine. I hope that at an
early date we will have legisiation permitting
the manufacture, sale and consumption of
margarine in Canada.
Before I resume my seat, I should like to
read two letters which were sent to me. One
is fromn the Family Weifare Association of
Montreal which, I might explain, is the saine
as the Community Chest in Toronto. This
association is a marvelous organization, and
this year collected $700,000. In addition to
this organization there is a French-Canadian
federation, an Irish-Catholic federation, and
a Jewish organization. Perhaps I should say
that the Family Welfare Association does not
give hei-p to a family immed.iately a request
is received, but sends a representative to make
a personal investigation of the family's condition. Here la the resolution passed by the
directors of the association, at a meeting held
on March 26, 1947:
Whereaa the short suPply of butter precludes
the use of this product by the low income
group.
Whereas the decontrol of butter will inevitably inease the price of this prod.uct and
further affect its use by the needy of our coinmunity;
Whereas the use of butter substitutes such as
oleomnargarine bas been recognized by ail
countries except Canada;
Be it resolved that the Family Welf are
Association of Montreal urge the federal government to pass legisiation allowing the sale of
oleomargarine in Canada, and that copies of
this resolution be forwarded to aIl agencies in
Montreal jnterested in -the maintenance of
proper food standards, and request support of
this resolution.
And here is a recommenda4ion from the
Canadian Restaurant Association:
Whereas the rapid rise in living costs as
indicated by the cost of living index and the
daily experience of consumers presses most
heavily upon the medium income groups, a high
proportion of whom necessarily ta ke their meals
in restaurants,
And whereas restaurant operators find themselves faced with a steady increase in price of
those items which they procesa for restaurant
patrons;

It is therefore recommended by .the Canadian.
Restaurant Association that irnmediate stepa bie
taken to legalize the manufacture and sale of
oleomargiarine in Canada, particularly in view
of the fact that statisties published by the
governiment reveal that there is not now aun
adequate supplýy of butter available for domestie
use.
The foregoing recommiendation la offered dfter
the moat careful consideration and reference ta
restaurant operators' opinions from coast te
co.ast. It le urged in the sincere belief that the

SENATE

adoption of the foregoing recommendation
would be of material assistance to the restaurant industry in controlling its costs without injury to the health of the consumners, the latter
statement being predicated upon the assumption that the manufacture of oleomuargarine
would only be permitted under strict government supervision and the establishment of high
standards of purity ;and nutrition.
Hon. Mr. MacLENNAN: If the ban on
margarine were lifted, would the restaurants
s-educe their charges?
Hlon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: I should say
that if they have the big heart that my honourable Scotch friend has, they wouldi.
Hoinourable ,senatýors, the dairy industry
would flot, be injured ini any way by the passing of this bill. What we bape to ask ourselves is this: Can this house, can parliament,
refuse to act when hundreds of thousands of
people are crying for more fats and vitamin-s?
Can we take that responsibility and give as
our only reason the fact that dairy associations are opposed to oleomargarine? I hope
that wben, the time comes to vote upon this
bill, the Senate will be guided by the motto
of the Boy Scouts-Du one good deed every
day-and pass the bill.
Hon. R. B. HORNER: Honourable senators, I too have receivcd a good many letters
-from
farmers'
organizations
throughout
Canada. It is strange that ail the letters
received. by the bonourable senator from
Waterloo (Hon. Mr. Euler) should be of one
kind, wliereas ail those I received are of
another. Hýowever, I agrce with bim. on one
point. Wben I am refused permission to selI
wbere I please, I am greatly annoyed. And
right here I xviii offer to make a bargain with
the honourable gentleman. If hie removes the
embargo on the shipment of Canadian cattle
to tbe United States, 1 will support his bill.
Hon. Mr. *EULER: My honourable friend
knows that it is casier for him to support my
bill than it, is for nie to remove the embargo
on the export of cattie.
Hon .Mr. HORNER: The question of the
export of olîr cýattle was taken up at the
Geneva conference, aud the United States
gencrously raiscd its quota on imports of large
cattlýe from 225,000 to 425.000, and on calves
and liglit catile from 125,000 te, 225,000. But
the Canadian gýoveromeot says: "No, you must
not scli to the United States." Even when our
stockyards were crowded, when the packing
bouses could not bandle -aIl the cattle available and we had not enougb feed for them,
tbe .government still refused to let us ship
to the United States, on the ground that the
bigher prices sccured tbere would result in
increascd meat prices in Canada.

Now we are asked to do sometbing that
would press the farmers further down. The
life of a dairy farmer is already bard enougb,
as I know. I speak from. intimate knowledgeif I may be allowed to refer to it-because
I personally have been milking cows for
fifty-five years. The bonourable senator from
Waterloo (Hon. Mr. Euler) says that butter
bas been scarce for ten years. I do not tbink
su. It is strange tbat some people get ahI
worked up because the price of butter bas
been around 70 cents during tbe last three
montbs. I maîntain tbat the price sbould
bave been that bigb for the last four years.
Hon. Mr. EULER: Wbo can buy it?
Hon. Mr. HORNER: People are buying it.
I have stated on two or three occasions in
tbis chamber that there would be plenty of
As
butter if tbe price was bigh enougb.
things bave been, farmers could not afford to
make it. You cannot bave an eigbt-bour day
on a daÂry farm, unless you have more than
une crew. You bave got to get up early for the
first milking of the eows, and more than eigbt
bours must go by before you can do your
second milking. In tbe province wbere I live
conditions are different from those in the
East. We have large areas of grass, but no big
cities in wbicb to ,'ell wbole milk. If we were
able to get a profitable market, we could
produce a great amount of butter.
Wýhen we are considering tbe injury that
would be done to the dairy industry if tbis
bill were passed, we should tbink of the
cbildren and other people wbo drink milk
every day. Wben butter is made, milk is
abundant. If you interfere with tbe dairy
industry in such a way that you curtail tbe production of milk, wbat effect will tbat bave
upon the cbildren of this country?
Hon. Mr. EULER: Would it ot be better to
let tbem drink the niilk, instead of using it to
make butter whicb people cannot afford to
bux?
Hon. Mr. HORNER: People cao niford to
boy butter, at the present rates of wages. I
believe tbat eventiîally there wiul be plcnty of
butter, and that the price ivill go down to
60 cents or less.
Like other senitors, I received a comnmunication from tbe Restaurant Association.
But before we indulge in a lot of sympatby
for the restaurants, let us not forget some of
the tbings they bave donc in recent years. I
know somet.bing about tbis, because I travel
about a good deal in Canada. They increased
tbeir charge for a cup of tes or coffee from 5
cents to 10 cents. Wben the price of butter

FEBRUARY 18, 1948
went up they raised their charge for meals
and eut the customer's butter ration in two, so
they gained in both ways.
1 have &omne correspondence on this subi ect
which, unfortunately, is flOW up in my room.
I emphasize that I arn very strongly opposed
to the proposai to allow the manufacture and
sale of margarine in Canada. I would just
]ike to say to my honourable friend who gets
so, alarmed about prohibitions: if hie will take
as strong an interest in lifting the ban on the
sale of cattie to the United States as hie lias
in the sale of margarine, I1think we can get
together.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. ARTHUR W. ROEBUCK: Honourable senators, I should like to compliment the
senator from Waterloo (Hon. Mr. Euler) on a
most excellent address. In commenting upon
it I do not propose to repeat what lie lias said.
I also wish to express my appreciation of
wliat the honourable gentlemen from Aima
(Hon. Mr. Ballantyne) lias liad to say.
No mnore eloquent address was. ever made
than that by the founder of Cliristianity wlien
He said :
Inasmuch -as ye have doue it unto one of the
least of these . .. ye have done it unto Me.
I too come from a great city wliere the
parents of many children receive low icomee
and require the best of food to fit them for
their liard labour.
Honourable members have just been
appointed to a com'mittee, for the study
of human rights, and fundamental freedoms.
I know of no freed-om more fundamental than
freedom of choice of what 1 shall eat; and
I look upon it as a piece of impertinent
tyranny that anyhody should tell me that I
cannot eat something that is nutritious and
valuable to me, and which I want. The
strongest argument my lionourable. friend from
Waterloo (Hon. Mr. Euler) advanced was
tliat lis bill is intended to uphold tlie freedom
of choice. I think it is wrong-and I use that
word in the moral sense-for any government
to take sides with an industry for the purpose
of compelling the public to support it.
I too was raised on a farm, and know
wliat it is to, milk eows, and wliat dreary and
hard work is the cliurning of butter. Far be
it fromn me to, do anything that would injure
the farmers of this eounitry. But I should like
to make a practical suggestion. After ail, the
government is always in a jam in matters of
this kind whicli cal for eompromise; but for
goverments, as for conflicting industries, compromnise is a good principle to follow, so long
as tlie principle itself is not compromised. My
mind goes baek to, my days on the farm many
years ago, wlien Canada was a poor country,

in the late 80's or early 90's. The United States

placed a tariff against farm produets, with the
result that we lost that market for our barley,
onts and wlieat. Our livestock also was
affected, particularly our lambs. The farming
population of Canada was on the verge of
poverty. I realized then, and I have borne
the knowledge through life, that our farmers
more tlian anyone else are diependent on the
sale of their produets abroad.
In 1911 I joined with the other members
of tlie Liberal party in an attempt to open
the markets of the United States to, our farm
produets, and our friends on the opposite
side-by a means which I will not recount
now-defeated us in that high purpose. But
during the years tliat have followed we have
quietly aceomplislied hy negotiation what
we failed to do in that eampaign-we have
opened the markets of the United States.
Now we find ourselves voluntarily prohibiting
the export of somne of our produets to that
eountry. This topie was referred to by my
honourable friend from Blaine Lake (Hon.
Mr. Horner).
It does seem to me, gentlemen, that when
we find ourselves in a jam of this kind the
best way out is to follow good Liberal principles. At tlie present time-in order to
hold down tlie price of meat for the benefit
of the eities--we are abusing our farm population by depriving them of a market which
is due to them. That is not a good Liberal
principle. On the other liand-in order to
benefit the farmers, we are told, though I
really think it is the big dairy industry-we
are preventing in a higli-landed manner the
people of our cities from buying oleomargarine. I say, why not offset the one against
the other? If the farmers objeet to margarine, wliy do we not follow a good Liberal
principle and solv-e the dilemma by lifting
tlie ban on the importation and manufacture
of margarine and at the saine time lift the
ban against the export of cattle to the markets
of the United States?
Hon. Mr. HORNER: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: No farmer would
have a sound objection to a compromise of
that kind. We would therehy solve the two
problems, and at the same time be acting
in line with good Liberal and democratie
principles.
Hon. Mr. HAIG : May I ask my honourable
friend whetlier hie or the honourable gentleman
from Blaine Lake (Hon. Mr. Horner) wil
lie the leader of the new party?
Hon. Mr. EULER: It may be a coalition.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Oh, oh!

SENATE
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: My friend is being
facetious when he talks about a new party.
I should like to join with the gentleman frorn
Blaine Lake, provided he will associate himself
with my party.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: That is flot an answer
to my question.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: As to lifting the ban
on exports of cattie, that is a gond Liberal
principle. On the other hand, when my friend
talks about maintaining the ban against the
manufacture, import and sale of margarine,
that is a bad Liberal principle. So I repeat,
let us offset the one against the other and
follow a good principle on both sides.
In conclusion I wish to say that I am in
favour of lifting the ban on margarine, even
if it cannot be accompanied by another act of
justice and reason that would satisfy those
who feel themselves injured.
Hon. A. L. BEAUBIEN: The honourable
senator, I arn sure, will admit that from 1930
until the outbreak of the war the farmers
were producing food for the pcople of the
cities at much below the cost of production.
But did he get up and speak on behaîf of the
farmers as he is now speaking on behaîf of
the consurners, who are paying no more than
the just price of farm products today?
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: Several questions
are wrapped up in one. In the first instance,
my friend asscrts that the farmers during the
war were not. and are not now, makiog money.
Hon. A. L. BEAUBIEN: No, I did not say
thut.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: I thought I heard
bim say so.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: He said
making money in 1930.

they were not

Hon. A. L. BEAUBIEN: From 1930 to the
outbreak of the war.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCIÇ: I do not know
whether they were or not. At all events, I
arn not responsible for that. But 1 will say
this: the farmers of Canada were neyer s0
prosperous as they are today; they neyer sold
their produets at so higli a price, and they
neyer paid off their mortgages as thcy are
doing at this time.

I did in 1930 is of the slighteflt interest.

My

friand asks if I was helping tha farmers then

as I arn now? Well, I have neyer lost my
interest. in the farm movement.
Hon. A. L. BEAUBIEN: But you want
cheap food.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: As a matter of fact
I supported the old farmers' Progressive party
in those early days of 1920 to 1930.
Hon. A. L. BEAUTIEN: That is when you
were buying eggs at 15 cents a dozen and
butter at 20 Cents a pound. But you did not
say anything about it in those days.
Hon. Mr. EULER: What has that got to
do with the question?
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: What I did about
20-cent butter in 1930 is hardly an argument
which would intarest anybody now. Certainly
it is not one which would carry their minds
to any conclusion. 1 do not know what I
did in 1930 about 20-cent butter, other than
eat it.
Hon. A. L. BEAUBIEN: Do
what the farmer did?

you know

Hlon. Mr. ROEBUCK: Someone says butter
never sold at 20 cents a pound. 1 do not know.
The honourable senator from St. Jean Baptiste (Hon. Mr. Beaubien) says it did.
Hon. Mr. TIORNER: It sold at 15 centslots of it.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: I have somnething
here which 1 think I wiIl take just time
enoug-h to mention to my honourable friend
from Waterloo (Hon. Mr. Euler). It is a
private letter from a mutual friend who
resides in the senator's town and who on February 3, when the letter was written, was in
Florida. I will give the writer's naine if
anyone requests it. He says: "Tell Senator
Euler I arn buying oleomargarine at 42 cents
a pound instead of butter at $1.05 a puund."
I offer that information, with my congratulations, to the honourable member for Waterloo.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Vaillancourt,
debate was adjourned.

EXPORT AND IMPORT PERMITS BILL

Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: And when 1 comnpare conditions on the farm today with those

whcn I was young, I arn struck ,vith the contrast. The farmers do not need restrictive
legisiation to boîster their position. So far
as I arn concerned, I do not think that what

of Bill U-3, an Act to amend the Export and

Import Permits Act.
H1e said: In the unavoidable absence of the
leader, I move the second reading of this bill.
I arn informed that the honourable senator
from Inkerman (Hon. Mr. Hugessen) %vil]
explain the bill.

FEBRUARY 18, 1948
Hon. A. K. HUGESSEN: Hanaurable senators, this is a bill ta amend the Export and
Import Permits Act, a measure which was
passed by this parliament in the apring of
last year and was assented to on the l4th of
May last. Some honourable memnbers may
recaîl the discussion we had on that measure
on April 30 last.
Before I deal with the amendinents which
the present bill introduces, I should like ta
refresh my own mind and, perbapa, the
minda of honourable senators as to the contents and purport of the original Act which
it is now sought ta amend. That Act conferred upon the Governor in Council power
ta control exporta froin and imuports into
Canada. Previously these powers had been
exercised under the National Emergency
Transitional Powers Act.
The Act of 1947 does four principal things.
Firat, it allaws the Governor in Council ta
estahlish, and from turne ta turne ta amendl a
list of gooda which cannot be exparted from
Canada without a licence obtained from the
minister-in this case the Minister af Trade
and Commerce. There is a provisa that these
gooda for which. a permit must be obtained
can be of only thrce classes--war materials,
or materials which in the opinion af the
Governor in Cauncil should be controlled in
order ta secure an adequate supply and distribution of such materials in Canada, or materials which should be controlled in order ta
implement an inter-governmental arrangement
between 'Canada and saine other country.
Second, the Act of 1947 permits the Governor
in Council ta cstablish, and from time ta turne
ta amend, a list of gooda which cannot be
importcd into Canada without a permit froin
the minister, as soon as practicable after
that these classes of goada must either be
those of which there ia a scarcity in world
markets, or of which there is governinental
contrai in the countries of arigin, or whîch are
subject ta international allocation by international agreement. Third, thc Act provides
that it shail expire sixty days irom the coinmenoement af the first session of parlininent ta
commence in the year 1948. Fourth, it requires
the minister as soon as practicable after
December 31, ta submit a report ta parliament
about the aperatians under the Act. That is
the report which was tabled by the honourable
leader yestcrday, and of which copies have
been distributed.
A very brief summary of what has heen
donc under the Act may bc of intereat ta
honourable senatars. Firat, with regard ta the
contrai, of exporta: froin May 14, which was
the date on which the Act came into force, a
list of commodities subjeet ta export control

181

was established by order in council. Those
commoditiea were 542 in number. Since May
14 and up to December 31, 1947, 10 commodities have been added, and 32 have been
deleted, so that as of December 31, 1947,
there were stili 520 conimodities under export
contrai. Those are listed in the orders in
council attacbed ta -the minister's report. I
think any of us would feel it rathýer disappointing that although the Act has been in
operation for nearly a year it has only heen
possible to decrease the number of cominoditics subject to export contraI, fram 542 to 520.
When the order in council came into force
on May 14, 1947, there were 690 applications
pendiin-g for export permits, and from -May
14 to December 31, a furthcer 77,504 applications were received and deait with, export
permite bein.g issued in 73,819 cases, and
rejected in 1,909 cases. Approximately 2,466
applications were withdrawn when it, was discovered, that the goode to which, the applications referred were flot under export control
in any event.
As regarde imports, by the same order in
council of May 14 laat, the governor in council estaiblished- a list of 67 commodiities which
became subject to import, control under this
legisiation. Since 'May 14 one commodity
bas been added and 24 removed, su, that as
of Decemýber 31 last, there were stili 44 commodities under import control. That is
a slightl-y better record than in the case of
exporta, showing that we have had a reduction
from 67 to 44 commodities, or practically
one-third.
Stili dealing with control during the period
of May 14 to December 31, 1947, there were
4,207 applications for import permits, of which
4,014 were approved- and 193 refused.
Having dealt with the preamble, 1 should
like ta corne to the substance of Bill U-3. It
does three specific things. In the first place,
it extends the life of the Act for two years;
that is, until ninety days wfter the commencement of the firat session of parliament coinmencing in the year 1950. In a few moments
I should like to give honourable senators the
reasans why it is desired ta extend the Act
for two years, but for the time bein-g I should
like to, direct attention ta a very peculiar
state of affaira which exista in regard ta the
Act as it, now reads in the statute book. Last
year it was obviously the intention of parliament ta enact the Act for a peried af only
anc year or less, but I should like ta point
aut the language which parlýiament used. It is
set out in the statute as follows:
This Act shail expire sixty days f rom the
commencement of the first session af parliament
comnlencing in the year 1948.

SENATE

Our present session of parliament did not
commence in 1948, it began in December 1947.
If the ordinary course is pursued there will be
no session of parliament commencing in the
year 1948, with the possible result that under
the language employed in the Act passed last
year there will be no termination of any kind
to this statute.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: That is the first reason
I have heard why the session was called in
December.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: The only good reason.
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: I call attention to
this state of affairs for two reasons. First,
it indicates how very careful we have to be
in scrutinizing legislation received from the
other house-last year apparently no one
noticed this condition when we passed the
measure-and second that the bill before us
continues to make use of the same language.
It says:
This Act shall expire ninety days from the
commencement of the first session of parliament commencing in the year 1950.
Obviously we shall have to tighten this up in
order to make it expire in two years.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: That problem is covered
in the control bills. If it starts before December 31 it expires on December 31.
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: Just here I want
to deal very briefly with the reasons that lie
behind the two-year extension now desired.
In the main, they arise out of world conditions, for which Canada is in no way responsible and which she cannot regulate or control.
Most important, perhaps, is the continuing
world shortage of food and feeding stuff. Since
the passing of the Act last year, the situation
has become aggravated by the disastrous
European crop failure of last summer. In
order to carry out our food contract with the
United Kingdom and our responsibilities
under the International Emergency Food
Council's allocations, and at the same time
safeguard our domestic food and feed supply,
export control of certain foodstuffs has been
imperative, and I think it is likely to be for
some time to come.
Then there are other commodities produced
in this country--such as textiles, steel and
steel products, building materials, wood and
wood products, paper and chemicals-for
which there is such a world demand that
export control is necessary to ensure that our
domestic demand will be supplied and that
these commodities are not siphoned off to other
parts of the world which are prepared to pay
almost any price for them.
A further reason for export control is to
ensure that products which we do export shall

go to our regular customers in every country.
In other words, as we cannot provide all of
our customers in other countries with the
full amount of their requirements-of flour,
for instance-we should make sure that our
customers of long standing get as large a proportion as we can provide of what they were
accustomed to receive from us in past years.
Another complication which makes export
control necessary arises out of the Hyde Park
agreement. Certain commodities which the
United States exports are under control when
sent to other countries; but under the Hyde
Park agreement, when they come to Canada
they are exported without control of any kind.
It is therefore obviously necessary that Canada
see that these commodities are not re-exported
in violation of United States controls.
Finally, in view of the Marshall Plan, I
think we can say that export control will be
necessary for some time. If. as we all hope,
Canada is asked under the Marshall Plan to
provide a substantial part of some of the
materials needed by European countries, it
will be necessary for us to maintain export
controls so as to be certain that we shall have
those articles available.
Much the same situation applies with
respect to import control, though the arguments are perhaps not quite so strong. There
are a number of commodities such as fats,
sugar, cocoa and tin which are still under
international allocation between the nations
of the world. So long as the agreements are
in effect the importation of those things must
remain under control, for two purposes: first,
so that Canada will be sure to get no more
and no less than the share to which she is
entitled under these international agreements;
and second, to ensure that when these commodities do reach Canada they will be fairly
distributed among merchants and manufacturers here.
Section 6A of the bill imposes a penalty upon
any person who, for the purpose of procuring
the issue of any permit under the act, wilfully
furnishes any false or misleading information
or knowingly makes any misrepresentation.
There is a rather interesting reason for this
proposed amendment. The export quota for
any individual timber firm is based by the
Timber Controller on a percentage of the firm's
domestic sales. Some bright and not overscrupulous individual submitted to the controller a fictitious list of domestic sales in
order to obtain a higher export quota than
that to which he was entitled. Unfortunately
the Act contained no provision under which
he could be penalized, and it was impossible
to prosecute him under the Criminal Code, so

FEBRUARY 18, 1948

this amendment has been introduced to stop
that loophole which has been discovered in
actual operation of the Act.
Section 15 requires that an annual report
of the operations under the Act be submitted
to parliament by the minister as soon as possible after the 31st day of December each
year, or, if parliament is not then in session,
within fifteen days after the opening of the
next session.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: There is one question
that I would like to put to my honourable
friend. In the past gold was used to pay for
international transactions, but now we try to
get payment in United States currency. Under
these export permits what quantity of goods
did we sell to people abroad who paid us in
United States currency, and what quantity
to people who paid for the purchases with
money that we lent them?
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: I have not got
those figures. I suggest that this bill might
properly be referred to the Banking and Commerce Committee, where we should have an
opportunity of hearing the Minister of Trade
and Commerce or his deputy, and I shall
make it my business to see that an answer is
given to that question.
Hon. SALTER A. HAYDEN: Honourable
senators, I hope that the honourable gentleman who explained the bill (Hon. Mr.
Hugessen). will move that it be referred to a
eommittee for further consideration. I had
something to say about the bill that came
to us from another place last year. There
are serious implications in this legislationin the granting of import controls, for instance.
If you give the government the right to say
what kinds and quantities of products may
enter the country, the government may be the
only purchaser of certain products, and it
will dispose of these to various industries at
such prices and on such terrms as it sees fit.
That permits of many things. I am not imputing motives to anybody, but one result
would be a restriction of the entry of new
people into any industry depending upon
goods imported by the government, because
allocations would be made on a basis to take
care of operators already in the industry and
to permit some manufacture at a profit.
The implications of import control,, to my
way of thinking, are very serious and far
reaching. It is a sort of control that we
necessarily had during the war, and I do not
like the principle. I recognize that to some
degree it is necessary, but I feel that parliament should be careful to keep its hand on
it. The only way thaf can be done is by
granting a very limited life to the Act whenever it comes up for consideration. A lot of
5853-14

evidence would have to be given in committee
to satisfy me that this act should be extended
to 1950. If that extension were granted, the
Senate would have no effective opportunity to
make any further amendments in the meantime. We should extend the life of the Act
for only a very limited period. Then if the
government wishes to have the controls continue beyond that period, we shall get a
further opportunity to consider the whole
matter. There are great dangers inherent in
these controls, and we should make an exhaustive inquiry about them in committee.
Hon. T. A. CRERAR: Honourable senators,
I find myself wholly in agreement with the
view expressed by the honourable senator
from Toronto (Hon. Mr. Hayden).. I rather
fancy this will not come as any surprise to
members of this bouse. I do not like the
principle of the bill. I did not like it when
the bill, came here before, and I doubt
if at any time in the future I could ever bring
However, in the
myself to like it.
apparently difficult transition from the dislocations of a terrible war to the ordinary
work of peacetime, there may be some
necessity for a measure of this kind. It is
typical of a good many measures today that
seek to enlarge controls by the government
over activities that normally should be free
of such control. That is why I wholeheartedly
support the suggestion of my honourable
friend from Toronto that the life of this Act
should be extended for only a brief period, and
I certainly hope that when the bill comes
back from committee there will be an amendment limiting the extension to one year. I
sometimes wonder where we are eventually
going to land, with all the controls in which
we are becoming enmeshed-control of farm
products; refusal to permit export of other
farm products to the United States; controls
here there and almost everywhere.
The
principle of these controls is unsound, if we
are to maintain in future that free way of
life in which all of us were reared. Let me
repeat, I hope that when the bill comes back
to this house from committee the life of the
act will be reduced to one year.
Hon. ARTHUR ROEBUCK: Honourable
senators, no one will be surprised if I too agree
with the remarks of the last two speakers. I
noticed with some interest that the honourable
gentleman who explained the bill (Hon. Mr.
Hugessen) expressed disappointment that so
few commodities had been removed from the
operation of this Act during the past year.
I am not in the least surprised at that
situation-though I might say I am disappointed-because controls of this kind, once
imposed, are almost always released by those

exercising them only when compelled to do
so. I am simply expressing my hearty concurrence in what has been said by the two
speakers who preceded me.

SPEECH FROM THE THRONE
ADDRESS IN REPLY

The Senate resumed from Monday, February 16, the consideration of His Excellency the
Governor-General's Speech at the opening of
the session, and the motion of Hon. Mr.
Ferland for an address in reply thereto.
Hon. ARTHUR MARCOTTE: Honourable
senators, this innovation of leaving open for
a period of time the debate on the Address
has produced this good result, that we have
had a greater number of excellent speeches
by honourable senators than has been the
custom in the past. We had evidence of this
on Monday night, in the splendid and forceful speech made by the honourable senator
from Vancouver South (Hon. Mr. Farris).
As previous speakers have done, I wish to,
congratulate the mover and the seconder of
the Address. I also wish, with pleasure, to
express my thanks to honourable members of
the Senate who attended the last meeting of
5853-14J

185

the United Nations in New York, for the
way in which they represented Canada and
the Senate. The reports they made to us
were very enlightening, and gave us a vivid
picture of that meeting. They offered us the
hope that the United Nations were step by
step getting closer to the goal of peace. One
of the speeches ended almost like a prayerthat Providence would preserve us.
Events are moving so fast that the world
situation is changing from week to week, if
not from day to day. The address made by
the honourable senator from Inkerman (Hon.
Mr. Hugessen) sounded a note of warning.
Since the opening of this debate the outlook
bas not been so bright. The declarations
made by Bevin and Churchill, the assassination of Gandhi, the monetary situation in
France, the continuing activity of guerillas in
Greece, the intestinal wars in China, in Palestine and in India, are not very encouraging.
Even our representative, Mr. Pearson, has
admitted that it may become necessary to set
up another society of nations and-note the
words-with Russia outside of it, if need be.
Also, the speech of the honourable senator
from Vancouver South (Hon. Mr. Farris) on
Monday was based on facts which cannot be
denied, and which show not only that the
situation is grave but may become worse.
Read the recent farewell address of General
Eisenhower, and if you do not become
alarmed, at least you will realize that we have
to take precautions.
Had I spoken a few days ago, I would have
addressed to you statements similar to those
of the honourable senator from Vancouver
South, not with the same eloquence, but with
at least equal sincerity. Yet there is a difference in our point of view. The situation
does not appear as dark to me as it does to
others, and I shall present facts to substantiate my statements. Like all well-thinking
people I still believe that the old Roman
adage-Si vis pacem para bellum-is sound.
There is only one way to ensure peace, and
that is to be strong enough to preserve it, to
be firm enough that nations opposed to us will
think twice before attacking. When I hear
it suggested that we should disarm and destroy
the most powerful weapons we have, I shudder
in wonderment at the frivolity of such
proposals.
Would you destroy your fire-fighting equipment just after you have quenched a fire?
Would you disarm police officers when murderers and thieves are at large? No. As was
intimated by the honourable senator (Hon.
Mr. Farris), we know that our homes are
constantly threatened by fire, our lives by

SENATE

mu-derers and oui prorerty by thieves. We
know that war bas always existed and will
continue to exist, unless we are prepared to
stop it by making the world realize that we
are ready to use arms, if necessary, to defend
ourselves. This is no threat to any nation;
neither is it a declaration that we want war.
It is simply an announcement that we are
desirous of living in peace, and that we are
taking out insurance against war.
From this viewpoint I wish to refer to a
few statements that have been made recently.
We all read--and I think our representatives
at the last meeting of the United Nations in
New York heard-the accusations made by a
Russian representative that our democracies
were warmongers. The following are some of
the answers, made by American senators,
writers, and statesmen, to accusations against
thcm personally. First, I quote from an article
by John Foster Dulles, member of the United
States delegation to the United Nations, which
appeared in the Cosmopolitan Magazinc of
this month. It reads:
I did not make the statement which Mr.
Vishinsky ýattributed to me. J have repeatedly
said, and I again say, that another war need
not be and must not be. And J have directed
myself ýto that end . . .

Soviet dictators, like

all dictators, want to keep their power and to
increase it. For that, they must make it
appear that Soviet peace is end.angered.
The next statement was made by James F.
O'Neil, National Commander of the American
Legion, and is as follows:
During the past decade, Soviet Russia bas
impressed eight governments and eighty-eight
million people into the Russian sphere. Since
V-J Day, she bas succeeded, through the use of
the veto, intimidation and double talk, in stalling every substantial move towards world unity.
Members of the American Legion share a livid
hatred of war, based on renembered experience. We remember that twice in our time
young Americans died and our nation trembled
for existence because we were unprepared for
wars thrust upon us. The Legion believes that
so long as the possibility of war exists, we
must be militarily, industrially and scientifically
prepared to fight a winning war.

John R. Deane, Major General (retired),
said:
During my stay in the Soviet Union I gained
a deep respect and real devotion for the Russian
people as distinguished from their leaders. I am
one of the millions of human beings who can
see nothing in any future war but complote and
equal disaster for the victor and the vanquished.
In brief, my reply to Mr. Vishinsky is that my
wish to be prepared for war with the Soviet
Union is second only to my fervent hope that
such a war will not occur.
The following is from a statement by Senator
Brien MeMahon of Connecticut, former Chairman of the Committee on Atomie Energy:
Mr. Vishinsky has vetoed an effective Anierican plan to do away with atomie bombs, al-

though every other nation but his is one
hundied per cent for it and believes it to be
fair and right. An accurate list of warmongers
will include every statesman who lias attempted
to sabotage an effective international control of
weapons of mass destruction. A reading of my
speeches on .the subject will give the lie to
Mr. Vishinsky.
Vishinsky placed Senator MeMahon's name
before the United Nations General Assembly
as a "warmonger" because MeMahon stated
in Congress that the "United States should be
the first to drop atom bombs if the atom war
is inevitable."
And here are some comments by Walter
Winchell:
Either 'Secretary of State George Marshall,
ISenator MeMahon, and myself are warmongers,
Mr. Vishinsky, or you are a liar. You attacked
me because there is nothing in the world that
you and Mr. Molotov and Mr. Gromyko and
Mr. Stalin fear more than a man with a free
typewriter or microphone. But it is not I or
my typewriter or microphone that should be
enchained, as you proposed. It is you, Mr.
Vishinsky, who are in chains right now. I can
speak my mind, and you cannot. Along with
one hundred -and forty million other Amereans,
I am free to criticize our government; but if
you, the third-ranking man in the communist
dictatorship, criticized yours, you would be
shot, and you know rit. Your chief worry is
in keeping Americans from knowing what is
going on inside Russia. You and your atheist
government know that one independent and
honest American reporter inside Russia with a
microphone is more dangerous to the Communist party than any atomie bomb. And for
once, Mr. Vishinsky, you -are right.
Surely no one would accuse Canada of
wishing for or liking war. No one will say
that we have tried in the past or are trying
at present to conquer any territory, to deprive
any other people of their rights or their freedom in any form. We have become a party
to the charter of the United Nations. Honourable senators know what the aim of that
charter is: peace and freedom-freedom from
want and freedom from fear. We are bound
to share in preparedness to secure peace. Shall
we be called warmongers simply because we
adhere to that charter? Shall we be called
warmongers because we, along with other
people who fear attack, have signed the same
pledge and have promised to support that aim.
I leave it to the honourable members to
answer.
I stated a few moments ago that to me the
horizon does not look as black as it may
appear to some others. Here is why. Twice
within forty years the democracies have given
indisputable evidence of their might. Democracies are slow to awake; but, once awakened,
they demonstrate their strength, their capacity
to produce unlimited supplies of materials and
weapons of war, and their ability to crush
their enemies. It is said that fear is the
beginning of wisdom. Our enemies, if we have

FEBRUARY 19, 1948

any, will surely think twice before cballenging
our might, our capacity te defend ourseives
and our ability te secure victory. I have said
that fear is the beginning cf wisdom. It may
aise be said teday that fear is causing insanity.
In my opinion, the present stand taken by the
leaders of Russia is simply a demonstration of
fear, engendered by the terrible suffering and
destruction that country had te endure in the
course of the recent war. The honourable
senator froma Vancouver (Hon. Mr. Farris), in
bis speech on Monday last, told us about the
nations surrounding Russia which now are
under ber thumb. Russia is attempting te
protect herseif by setting up a wall cf buffer
nations which will first have te, be crushed
before hier ewn territery is invaded. Do we
flot appreciate that this is the real aim of
Russia? In the short time at my dispesai the
argumenl cannet be developed; but it seems
te me that the present situation indicates the
real aimi of the dictators governing Russia
today.
True, we may have more "Pearl Harbers,
when sudden and terrible attacks mnay be
infiicted upon us; it may happen that our
cities will be destroyed in a matter cf heurs,
if net minutes, during the first days or weeks
cf another war. But even sbould we or eur
allies be hurt er terribly weunded, we would
net be destroyed. Aware of our cwn ability
te deai blows, as we -have done in the past, we
are confident that in the end we will be the
same victorieus people that we were in the
last war.
Everyone seems te be afraid of Russia; yet,
even ber leaders, fanatic as they are in their
views, do net ignore the existing facts. When
tbey recapitulate wbat they received frem the
allied nations, more especially frem the United
States, te enable Russia te, resist the attacks
cf the German armies, they will realize that
tbe money and supplies and armaments which
were donated fer their salvation weuld, in the
event of anether war, be turned against thema.
Then they will begin te wonder if they are
capable cf resisting tbe might cf these forces.
These assertions are net a threat or challenge to Russia; they are merely an indication
that the demecracies are prepared te meet their
eppenents haîf way, and te fight if it becomes
necessary te do se.
Let us reccunt what Russia received frcm
the United States alene in the heur cf peril.
I wiil cite briefly certain figures taken fromn
an article published in the Red Bock cf last
month.
Under lease-lend: ever $1,1,500 million; in
war arniaments ;and equipment: 14,700 airplanes,
7,000 tanks, 52,000 jeeps, 375,000 trucks, 35,000
metorcycles, 15,000,0W0 pairs cf arniy beots,
2,670,00 tens cf cil and gasoline, 3,780,000 tires,
8,218 anti-aircraft gans, 131,033,00 submachine

187

gune, 415,000 field telephonee, $500 million worth
of machine tocle, electrical furuaces and generatore, $3:5,000,S00 worth of petroleum refinery
equipment 54i3,000 tons of explosives, $2,707,O000
worth of farm tractora and 34,477 tons of seeds.
These figures, and I could quote more, are
sufficient to prove that Russia will think bard
and often before turning against the powei-s
that gave her life when as a nation she was
at the door cf death. I think it unniecessary
to dwell further on that phase of my argument.
Honourable senators, we have ail beard with
approval the urgent appeai made by the
senstor from Vancouver (Hon. Mr. Farris)
that we stand united with our sister nations
of the Commonwealth and with eur AngleSaxon allies, to lead the world to peace and
security. I arn sure that in bis appeal the
honcurabie gentleman did not intend te
exclude our allies of other nationalities. H1e
would net exclude France, Belgium, the
Netheriands, Greece, China and more than
thirty other nations who share our pledge to
fight for liberty, for freedom fpom want and
fear, and for a world of civilizatien and plenty.
I amn not attempting te deal to any extent
with the ideology cf Russia and other coinmunist nations. A far more lengthy address
than we are accustomed te hear in this chamber would be required to deal adequately with
that phase of the situation.
Since I dictated these lines yesterday, I have
taken cognizance cf an account of an interview
with General McNaughten, the representative of Canada in the Security Counceil, published in this week's issue of the New Liberty
magazine. I wish to quote one paragraph
from that article whîch, deais especially with
what 1 arn discussing. General McNaughton
was asked:
. I there honestly a hope cf achieving a genuime workimg agreement with Russia?
H1e replied:
A working agreement of enormous importance
was achieved with the Soviet Union d'uring the
war. We should net abandon the hope that
similar oo-operation will be achieved in peace.
The area of agreement is now relatively small,
but it is possible te enlarge it.
Honourable senators, in the few relnaining
moments of my address, 1 wish te refer to the
splendid achievements of our Canadian representatives at the Olympic games in Europe.
Last Sunday a flash-news item came te
Canada and te the world at large, announcing
that Barbara Ann Scott, queen of the skating
world, had again won the champienship cf
the world. The people cf the city cf Ottawa,
of the province cf Ontario, and indeed cf the
whole cf Canada are proud of the success cf
this young woman. She has taught our yauth
the lesson that purpese, hard werk, perseverance and obedience te rules and teaching

SENATE

always lead to victory. Before the competition
it had been universally coûceded that Barbara
Ann, barring an accident, would repeat her
past performances and emerge victorious. She
won. Glory to her!
The early predictions as to the prospects of
the Canadian Olympic hockey team were not
so glowing. The team had not been conceded
a chance to win. Nevertheless, they went to
the games, where they fought worthy opponents on poor ice and at times were subjected
to stupid refereeing, and they won. They
deserved their victory.
Perhaps I sho'uld conclude my remarks at
this point, but it is my belief that in the minds
of the old and experienced members of the
Senate there is in these achievements something of a higher and deeper significance. To
illustrate what I mean I will cite only two
short quotations. About two years ago a
number of athletic instructors and teachers
were received by His Holiness the Pope, and I
quote from a press despatch the following:
Sport is a means of salvation.
Vatican City.-Pope Pius XII, Tuesday, told
a group of gynnastic instructors that sport is
not only a physical development, but also a
means of refining the mind when it is seeking
and communicating truth. It helps man in attaining the one end to which all others are
subordinated-serving and praising his Creator.
For this reason, said the Pope, we must rejoice at the fact that university graduates are
being entrusted with the guidance of the central
school of sports.
You will thus insist upon the great assistance
of sport in perfecting human faculties in the
struggle for life, while your ac.ademie training
will caution you ag.ainst establishing sports as
an end in se-a trend which is altogether too
frequent today and which should not exist.
My second quotation is taken from the
Ottawa Journal, in 1946, and is as follows:
Sportsmanship and Education
The fanous Memorial Cup, symbol of junior
hockey supremacy. has gone West, wrested from
St. Mirhael's College by Winnipeg Monarchs
after a series of grames whieh for dash and brilliance have never been exceeded in Canadian
sport.
The tens of thousands who saw these games,
the hundreds of thousands who listened to them,
inust have been pleased above all by one thing.
The fact that they were played throughout with
heart and sportsmanship, with these gallant
'teen-agers giving their all to win, but yet
knowing that while victory was important, the
game was the thing. One incident at the end
told that. St. Michael's had lost; the roar of
the crowd for the victors was in their cars; yet
they rushed over to their conquerors in what the
Toronto Globe and Mail describes as an "emotional outburst" to shake their hands, and "St.
Mike's anvil chorus stayed around after the
game to cheer the Winnipeggers."
We need never fear for our Canadian youth
when a thing like that can happen. Because
sportsmanship of that sort, capacity to play a
game hard and cleanly and lose greatly is more
than sportsmanship; it is true education. Henry

James once said-he was speaking of education
-that without sportsmanship there could be no
democracy. What he meant was that only by
ability to accept defeat, to bow to the verdict
for the other fellow, could we avoid the resort
to force which is the way of the~barbarian.
Sometimes we think that our schools and universities should stress sportsmanship more;
stress it as an essential to education-teach our
young people that while it is important to
know how to win, it is even more important to
know how to lose; that in certain circumstances
defeat may be more than victory.
To keep a sound mind in a healthy body,mens sana in corpore sano; to learn how to
win; to learn how to lose: this is the real
essence of sports and sportsmanship.
Queenly Barbara, members -of our Olympie
hockey team, representatives of the youth of
this country, you are the hope of Canada!
You have donc well for us and we want you
to accept this expression of our praise and
gratitude.
The address was adopted.

THE LATE SENATOR ROBICHEAU
TICIBUTES TO HIS MEMORY

On the Ordërs of the Day:
Hon. WISHART McL. ROBERTSON:
Honýourabie sen.ators, it is my sad duty and
responsibiiitýy to draw your attention to the

MARCH 8,1948
fact that since we last met we have lost one
of aur most esteemed colleagues, the Honourable John Louis Philip Robicheau.
Senator Robicheau was born on June 30,
1874, at Meteghan, Nova Scotia, the son of
Acadian parents, Philemon Robicheau and
Francoise Melanson Robicbeau. Rie paternal
ancestors came to Canada in 1628. He was
educatect at St. Joseph's College, Memramcook, New Brunswick, and St. Anne's College,
Church Point, Nova Scotia. In 1907 he
married- Mary F. de Benjamin Surrette, of
Hectanooga, Nova Scotia, and had tbree
chilfren.
For the firat twenty years after the turn of
the century he was employed by the Canadian
Pacifie Railway, and froin 1929 ta 1932 by the
Dominion Atlantic Railway, as travelling
auditor. Since 1922 he engaged in the lumber
business.
In 1925 he was elected- to the Nova Scotia
Legisiature as Conservative member for
Digby, and the following year was appointed
Farming Commissioner for the province. He
was de-feated at the general election of 1928,
and was called to the Senate in 1935, to represent Digby-Clare.
In poor health for some months, the late
senator passed away in. Quebec City, March 1,
1948.
Senator Robicbeau came from my native
province of Nova Scotia, wbere he was one
of the most prominent and respected representatives of the Frencb-Acadian people. In
recent years he did flot of ten participate in
our debates here, but he was a faithful attendant at our committee meetings. Both in this
bouse and througbout his native, province he
will long be remembered for his many fine and
estimable qualities.
Hon. JOHN T. HAlO: Honourable senators, seldom since I came to this bouse some
years ago have I risen in my place and said
of a departed member that bis colleagues
loved bim. A nman, to menit that tribute. must
have bad exceptional qualities; but I can
trutbfully say that those for wbom I speak on
this aide of the bouse leved John Robicbeau.
No matter bow cownhearted one might be at
any time, one would always be cheered up by
a talk with John Robicheau. He was sincerity
itself.
A good deal of bis life was spent in travelling over most of Canada andL a large part of
tbe United States. He bad great native
ability and was naturally well liked by the
people witb wbom be worked-.
Lt was my great pleasure and honour to
knlow the senatar's wife, a very fine woman,

and one of bis daughters, wbo bad a great
record during the war. To tbem L extend nîy
sympathy.
In the passing of aur esteemed colleague
Canada bas lost a real son, and L have loat
one of the best friends I have had since
entering this bouse.
(Translation.)
Hon. ANTOINE J. LEGER: Honourable
senators, during the thirteen years that I bave
had Sanator Robicbeau as deskmate, I bave
been in a position to appreciate the great beart
and noble nund of our most este em ed colleague,
now departed. Always gay, witty and a bit
given to teasing, he knew bow to make friends.
Charitable and obliging, he neyer was so happy
as wben he could belp someone. Suffering from.
a fatal illness, he saw death coming witb the
resignation inspired 'hy faitb and hope.
To bhis loving wife, bis admirable daugbter
and valiant sons, I extend my most sincere
sympatby. "O Deathl wbat bitter memories
follow ini tby wake."
(Text.)
Hon. R. B. HORNER: Honourable senators,
I bave neyer before attempted ta speak: in tribute ta a late colleague, but I sbould now like
ta jain witb other honourable members who
bave spoken about the passing of aur esteemed
friend. I arn sure tbat if my colleague from
Rosetown (Hon. Mr. Aseltine) were here, he
also would wisb ta say somnething. The reason
for the close association of my honourable
friend from Rosetown and myseif with the late
Senator Robicbeau was that ha spent twenty
years of bis ife in Saskatcbewan, and therefore readily understood those of us who came
from the West.
I should like ta mention Senator Robicbeau's
career with the C.P.R. in tbe West, wbere the
outstanding qualities of the man ware sbowný.
He started ta work there wben the salary was
quite smaîl, and later went ta Deatb Valley, in
Nevada, wbere be bad a wide experience with
men and affairs. Like many others, ha ended
up witb a quarter of a million dollars, on pa-per,
wbich disappeared. Ha tben returned ta Saskatcbewan ta start agaiýn at the bottom of the
ladder as agent for the Canadian Pacifie Railway, and because of his outstanding ability be
advanced rapidly.
I sbould like ta refer particularly ta an
incident wbich will be readily appreciated by
men from western Canada. While our late
friand was C.P.R. agent, he was asigned. ta a
place where railway cars were piled up and it
seemed impossible ta get tbings straightened
out. The railway company had just thýrown up

SENATE

its hands. Even though bis assignment was a
promotion, thie late senator said that he would
accept i t only on one condition-that he
be given fuit authority and be left alone, and
that if the people appealed to headquarters
their protests would be ignored. Realizing the
difficulties of the situation, lie told bis wife flot
to join hlm until the problem was worked out.
Meetings were held and delegations appoînted
to try to chase our late friend away; but he
stuck with the job, and four or five years later,
when other railways had cut in on the business,
which was not large, bis company begged him
to stay on and even off ered additional salary to
rernain. 1 just mention that to show Senator
Robicheau's fine qualities.
Anyone wlio visited the late senator's home
soon realized that nlot only was it his castle but
that of bis guests also. I do not know that I
ever enjoyed myseif more or feit more completely at home than I did on visits to bis
place. H1e was a sincere man, deeply ýreligious,
and of sterling character. Those who did not
know hlm well could scarcely appreciate bis
fine personality. To bis wife and family I
extend rnysincere syrnpathy.
Hon. JOHN J. KINLEY: 1, too, would like
to pay a tribute to a fellow-Nova Scotian, the
late Senator John Robicheau. 1 first knew
hlm when lie was a member of the provincial
legislature, at Halifax. To be elected as a
Conservative frorn the county of Digby was
in itself quite an achievement, and an evidence of considerable personal worth. Wen
I came to the House of Commons it was rny
privilege to have as a room-mate the then
member for Yarmouth, an Acadian of Frenchi
descent; and on many occasions Senator
Robicheau would corne to our roorn and discuss affairs in the province of Nova Scotia.
In fact, wben anything happened which was
out of the ordinary or of particular interest,
Senator Robicheau took the opportunity to
express to us bis intercst in the life of bis
native province.

Senator Robicheau came from one of the
little places in Nova Scotia; lie was a neighbour of the fishermen, the farmers, and the
seamen, and lie bad a keen interest in ail they
did and in their success. 1 arn sure that al
who knew hlm must have been impressed with
bis courtesy, bis sincerity, and aIl those characteristics which are so beautifully portrayed
in Longfellow's Evanqeline, that moving story
in verse of the Acadians in Nova Scotia.
I hardly need to say that Senator Robicheau
was an honest man. In hlm integrity was
sweetened wlth kindness. 11e was very happy
in bis senatorial position, and in the fact f bat
bis party bad recognized hlm by placing hlm
in the Senate of Canada. I believe it can

truthfully be said of birn that goodness and
înercy followed him ail the days of bis life;
and that bis widow and farnily, now that lie
lias been gathered to lis fathers, can lie sustained by the thouglit that lie lias gone to
"dwell in the bouse of the Lord for ever".

Hon. CYRILLE VAILLANCOURT (Translation) : Honourable senators, since the bonourahle senator from La Salle (Hon. Mr. Moraud) and I are the last two members of this

House wlio were privileged te, talk with our
late colleague, Senator Robicbeau, I feel tbat
it is rny duty to, recall for yoor benefit bis last
moments. 1 bad known Senator Robicbeau for

a few years only, but wben a man is endowed
with a noble character, a great beart and a
valiant soul, one bas not to live rnany years
with hlm to corne to understand and respect

him. I paid my Iast visit to Senator Robicheau
a few days before lie died. As 1 was about to
]eave, lie said to me: "It is probably the last
time we will see eacb other in this world;" but
being a fervent believer, Senator Ro'bicheau
added: 'One day we -hall lie together forever."
"You see," our late friend also told me, "I
bave now corne to the end of rny journey;
I arn like the setting son." I turned towards
the window to see at that very moment the
sun setting in aIl its glory-it was one of those
grand days of early Mardi and I thouglit:
After such a glorious sunset, a dazzling dawn
must corne.
Casting a last glance at my colleague's grave,
I recalled the radiant setting sun. The youth
of Acadia and of the whole of Canada bave
lost a great man who bas lielped bis fellow-men
and contributed to Canada's greatness. To bis
country lie lias given the best years of bis life.
Recalling that sunset batbed in a light so
sweet I cannot but think that otlier gorgeous
rnornings will dawn in ahl their glory upon our
fair land.
DAIRY INDUSTRY BILL
MOTION FOR SECOND READING

The Senate resumed from Wednesday,
February 18, the sdjourned debate on the
motion of Hon. Mr. Euler for the second
reading of Bill B, an Act to amend the Dairy
Industry Act.
Hon. CYRILLE VAILLANCOURT (Text):
Honourable senators, I shaîl deal objectively
witli the question of butter and oleornargarine.
Altbougb I do not share the views of some
of my bonourable colleagues, I hold thema in
higli esteem, and 1 trust that they feel like-

MARCH 8,1948
wise, as this debate on butter and oleomargarine affects flot only the interests of
mndividuals but the whole economy of the
country. However, let us get down to facts.
1 do flot deny that oleomargarine is a
wholesame and nutritious food, absolutely
harmless ta health. I wish, however, ta reply
to certain dlaims whicli may be questianed.
The first argument whicb was invoked
deait with personal freedom. Wliy, we have
been asked, are we denied the freedom to
eat oleomargarine if we prefer it to butter?
As my honourable colleague sat for several
years in another place, lie frequently must
have approved measures restricting individual
freedom in order to protect the ireedom of
the whole community. This lias occurred
several times; it is flot necessary to mention each case. The freedom so frequently
xnentioned bas been curtailed.
Immediately after the debate on oleomargarine Iast year, our honourable colleague
from Inkerman (Hon. Mr. Hugessen) introduced a bill to prohibit some imports and ta,
reduce exports. Tlius freedom is curtailed.
However, the bill was passed, on division it is
true; nevertlieless it was passed and assented
to. I wonder if last year, during the debate
on the saine subject, our colleague mentioned
this argument of personal freedom. No one
can deny that fresh vegetables, for instance,
are an excellent health-giving food, especially
at this season of the year wlien liome-grown
produce is not available. Nevertheless imports of fresh vegetables have been prohibited.
Wliy? To save dollars in order to prateat
the economy of our country and the prosperity
ai aur fellow-citizens. A principle of liberty is
fio doubt involved liere; but because the nation
should corne before. tlie individual we must
nat sacrifice or prejudice collective liberty in
order ta insure individual liberty.
Anather argument advanced was that the
poor cannot afford ta buy butter. Let us
analyse the plain facts. Butter caste 70 cents
per pound at the present time. In my locality
it is sold at between 64 and 69 cents, and is
advertised at that price in Le Soleil, a Quebec
newspaper. Wliat would oleomargarine cost if
it were allowed into, this country? 1 read in
tlie newspapers af Mardi 1 that a Dutch coimpany is prepared ta selI Canada margarine
at 38 cents per pound. That is the wliolesaIe
price in Holland; but if tlie oleomargarine
were exparted ta this country I doubt very
muai that the wliolesaler here could selI it at
lems than 45 cents a paund, or that the
retailer could seil it at lees than 50 cents a
pound. The dîfference between butter at 70
cents and aleomargarine at 50 cents would be

193

20 cents per pound. According ta statistias,
in 1946 the average per capita consumaption of
butter in Canada was 28 pounds. Twenty-eight
pounds multiplied by the difference in the
price of butter and the price af oleomargarine
-tiat is 20 cent&--gives $5.60. Tlierefore, if
butter were replaced by oleamargarine it
would result in a yearly saving ai $5.60 per
persan, or -015 per day, which is les. than the
cast ai a cigarette. Let us smake a cigarette
less a day--some people would be in better
liealth if they did sa-and the needy will have
their butter ration.
We liear mucli said about cliarity and the
pitiful lot ai the poor. That is well, but we
have ta be consistent and logical. There is at
present a shortage ai fat in Europe. A campaign lias becn launched acrass Canada ta
raise funds for the benefit ai European
orplians; but if we manufacture and import
oleamargarine we shaîl deprive these very samne
people ai the butter and fat they need.
Ta manufacture aleomargarine in Canada
we would have ta import seventy ta eiglity
per cent ai the component parts. Good
quality aleamargarine can be made iromn the
ails ai soybeans, cacoanuts, cottonseed, peanuts, and sunfiower seed; but ai these, soybean ail and sunflawer ail are the an-iy two
produced in Canada, and production casts
make it impassible for the Canadian producers ai these twa ails ta compete with the
producers ai other vegetable ails in such areas
as the South Pacifie, Ceylon, China, and
Southi America, where wages are exrtremely
low as campared with Canadian wages. It is
anly natural that if margarine were legalized
in Canada, the manufacturers ai the praduat
here would import the cheaper ails ta meet
tlieir needs.
Thus we are asked ta pass this bill ta allaw
the manufacture and importation ai oleomargarine under the principle af charity, in order
ta save about a cent and a hall ta every Canadian. The average price of butter in 1947
was 55 cents per pound, flot 70 cents per
pound. However, what about the poor oi
Europe? Let us flot forget that we fouglit
for the survival ai Christian civilization.
Wlien we examine the facte we find that last
year in alI ai Canada, $370 million was spent
for liquor while only haîf that amount was
spent for butter. How can anyone say that
butter caste too muai? Restaurant operators
as well as liospitals and other institutions
want the use ai oleomargarine; but if it is
allowed into this country wilI there be a
decrease in the price ai meals and board? The
saving will be so sinaîl that it cannot be taken
inta account. If there is a saving ai one cent

SENATE
on each meal, it will be the restaurat operator who wjll be the richer after a day's operations; the consumer will have been served
oleomargarine, but will flot -have saved one
cent.
It is claimed that under the Geneva treaty
we must accept oleomargarine. If we are
forced to accept oleemargarine by the Geneva
treaty, why introduce this bill? However, even
the Geneva treaty does flot prevent us from
guarding against 'the use of oleomargarine. Let
us review wh-at lias already been said in
another place.
We have spoken of Newfoundland. Why bring
up a situation which does flot exist? Newfoundland has refused to enter Coafederation.
Why should oleomargarine not be allowed
in Canada as it is in other countries?
Numerous other things may be done elsewhere, but net in Canada. For instance, I
doubt very mucli whether anyone would wear
a straw hat in Ottawa in January; but people
in California wcar them in January. We
have manners, habits, climate and a way of
living of our own, and in my opinion ýnobody
can dlaim that everything that is bcing done
in other countries may or must be donc in
Canada.
The production period in our
country lasts from six to eight months, while
in some countries it is a year-round period.
Because our production period lasts for only
six or eight munths, it is maintained that the
manufacture of oleomargarine should be
allowed in Canada during the montbs when
butter is flot being produced. Would this
be considered a humanitarjan and Christian
way of arranging things? When there is
plenty to be liad, and the farmers seli their
products at rcduced prices, the consumers are
ready to take advantage of the situation.
Then during the winter months, when the
farmers have to feed their cows in the barn
and production is mucli curtailed, the consumners tomn around and seek their supplies
elsewhere. Finally, when spring returas, the
consumer asks the farmer why he should pay
a highcr price for his butter. He dlaims that
the farmer lias bad nothing to do ail winter.
But during that time the farmer bas had to
work eîglit, ten and even fifteen hours a day
without getting anything for bis trouble, while
the city worker lias put in enly six or eight
hours a day, and lias been paid for it.
Another argument advanced is this. Denmark is said to be the greatest butter-produeing country in the world; yet its consumption
of oleomargarine-said to be the higlicat in
the world-is 38-8 pounds per capita, as
against 15-6 pounds of butter per capita.

Sucli astonishing figures require explanatien.
The reason is simple. Dcnmark is a poor
grain-producing country and must import
large quantities of feed for its cattle; censequently Danish cattlemen try te import the
cheapest feeds. Everyone knows today that
cattle, especially cows, are fed balanced meals
made up of grain mixed with meat, meal and
fats. Danish herdsmen import large quantities of oleomargarine te fecd -their cattle.
Whea some people sec those figures they
imagine that oleomargarine is used te feed
the Danish people, but actually it is used to
feed their cattle. I have been in Denmark,
but have seen ne oleomargarine on the table;
ealy appetizing butter and delicious cheese.
Another example lias been brought te our
attention. In the Unitcd States butter consumption feil te 8-5 pounds per capita in 1947,
whereas the consumption of oleomargarine
increased from 1-8 pouads in 1939 te 3-1
pounds last year. From 1941 te 1946 butter
production was reduced by 700 million pounds.
Oleomargarine was net the only factor respensible for that, but I shall not go inte detail,
as it would take tee long to do that. However,
it is obvieus that butter production bas
decreased with the increase in oleomargarine
consumrption.
I come now te my main argument. That I
sliould be se determined in supperting the ban
un olcomnargarine
in Canada will prubably
surprise certain people. The reason for my
stand is that I lived through the oleomargarine
era, from 1917 te 1923. I have good reason
te remember it. as I was then witli the Quebec
Department of Agriculture. From 1920 te
1922, aithougli the imports of oleomargarine
were not large-in fact, they were just a few
hutndred thousand pounds-the price of butter
was reduced by one-third. When one knows
our agricultural ecoflomy, especially in our
dairy industry, one understands liow a very
small change may alter the whole picture.
Judging from statisties. a 7 per cent reduetion
in our butter consumption would threatcn the
whole economie structure of this brandi of
agriculture. Therefore the introduction of a
commodity that would replace butter te the
extent of oaly 7 per cent would result in the
collapse of our market. This is due te the
fact that at present our eonly expert market
for butter is in the United States, and that
markct is conditional upon the Americans
opening their deors te our preduce.
It is a well-known fact that a few years ago
a great many ef our farmers started schling
cream, butter and livesteck te the United
States. As a result, several demestie creamcries wcnt eut ef business. Our farmers had

MARCH 8,1948
increased the size of their herds, and every
morning in Beauce, Dorchester and Frontenac
counties large convoys of cream-laden trucks
left for the United States. After a while the
Americans said, "No more butter, no more
cream, no more livestock from Canada." Our
market was disorganized overnight. That is
why I approve of the policy followed by our
government, which relies on a stable market in
a country where our produce will always be
required. Under normal conditions the United
States are self-sufficient. Had we marketed
our produce there during the war, rather than
in Great Britain, it is obvious that we would
have made more money; but as soon as markets returned to their former stability the
United States would have acted as in the past,
and would have thought of their own protection, which is the logical thing ta do. On the
other hand, England's production of foodstuffs
will never meet her needs, so the English
market means greater stability for us.
The butter industry is closely related to the
agricultural industry, owing to the fact that
by-products from butter-making are used in
stock-raising.
In the eastern provincesOntario and Quebec, as well as the Maritimes
-these
by-products are of treinendous importance. We are advised to make powdered
or dehydrated milk. As there are no byproducts of powdered milk, this industry
would not be of any assistance to stockraising. A blow to the dairy industry is a
blow to the livestock industry. If the livestock industry suffers any harm today there
will be a shortage of meat on the market
tomorrow; and then city people will not only
be deprived of butter, but they will also be
short of meat, eggs and poultry.
Besides, should there be a drop in stockraising, how would that affect the farmers of
the West? The greater proportion of western
grain is not eaten by you or me. Wheat alone
is used to make flour. We consume very little
oats, barley, rye or buckwheat. These grains
are used to feed our cattIe. If stock-raising
declines, shall we not be compelled to do what
was done not so long ago-pay the western
farmers to stop producing grain?
That
action may seem strange and paradoxical just
now, but things that have occurred once may
occur again.
These are the reasons why I am opposed
to oleomargarine.
I saw what happened
between 1917 and 1923. I lived through those
days and I was aware of the harm done to
this country's dairy and farming industry. I
should not like to see the same thing happen
again. To those who claim that oleomargarine would not prove detrimental to the
farm and dairy industries, I may say that in

the past the introduction of this product has
been harmful, and that the same causes will
again produce the same effects.
We are asked, "What about the consumer
in all this?" Well, consumption is dependent
upon production, and if the producer is
destroyed the consumer will starve.
What I am advocating is that both consumers and producers should work in harmony
and endeavour not to save half a cent per
head per day, but to ensure the greatness and
prosperity of this country.
Hon. W. J. HUSHION: Honourable senators, I must congratulate the honourable
senator from Kennebec (Hon. Mr. Vaillancourt) upon his able speech, although I disagree with his view. I was struck forcibly by
his remark that the difference between the
cost of butter and of oleomargarine would
mean less than $6 a year to an individual in
Canada. Well, last month I paid 73 cents a
pound for butter. If oleomargarine were selling at around 40 cents, as I understand it
the saving for a man with a fairly big family,
consuming perhaps a pound a day, would be
at least $1.50 a week, or $6 a month.
I come from a large city where, as honourable members know, many heads of families
earn not more than $35 or $40 or $50 a week.
In my opinion these people are entitled to
just as much consideration as any farmers are.
I appreciate the farmers' position, as in my
yaunger days I could have been considered
a sort of half-farmer myself; and I have some
slight knowledge of oleomargarine and butter,
for I have sold both. I am unable to follow
the argument that the manufacture of a
certain quantity of oleomargarine in this
country would disrupt the dairy industry, and
I understand that our farmers would be able
to produce an abundance of most of the
ingredients required for that manufacture.
What first caused me to be in favour of
oleomargarine was the statement made here
about a year ago by an honourable senator
from New Brunswick, a doctor, that oleomargarine is as nutritive as butter. I have
made some inquiries since then, and I find that
is so.
I cannot see any reason or logic in refusing
to make oleomargarine available to the man
who cannot afford to buy butter. A saving
of 30 cents a pound would be very important
to a man with a large family.
Hon. Mr. VAILLANCOURT: I think you
put the price of oleomargarine too low.
Hon. Mr. HUSHION: Perhaps I have. I
am only stating what I am told it will cost.
We do not know what will happen.

SENATE
Twenty-five years ago we could buy butter
for twenty-five cents a pound and meat for
from eigbteen to twenty cents a pound. That
price level was common to ail food commodities. The rise in the price of these commodities today really bits the poor man. I believe
the present cost of bread, for instance, is the
result of a combine and the operation of
co-operatives. Tbhey are nlot working for the
people, but for tbemselves; and to some
extent I do flot blame tbemn too mucb.
Let us look particularly at the price of milk.
One can readily sec how difficult it is for the
man with a small incarne to supply his family
witb a few quarts of milk a day at a cost of
eigbteen cents per quart. The saine situation
applies to beef. It may be said that the beef
is being sent across to the United States and is
bringing as much as a dollar a pound. But
surely the farmner can make money sellin-g
his produet at from twenty-five to forty cents
a pound.
1 bave attempted without success to understand the reason for the over-ail rise in the
prica of meat, flour, butter and milk, ail of
which are basic essentials for the man with a
family. Milk was at one time supplied to tbe
children in the schools in the city of 'Montreal,
but I understand that practice has been stopped in at least one school. Now the ebjîdren
who require milk must buy it, and pay six or
seven cents a pint for it. That gives one an
idea of the difficulties facîng the family man.
Far ha it from. me to want to disrupt whatever success the farmers are having as a result
of being organized. I know it is essential that
tbey prosper, but I do not think they bave
ever suffered as much as tbe poor people in the
city. We in, this bouse very seidom have
anything to say for that ciass. We continue
to pass legisiation giving away money; but
wbere does it corne from? It comes from the
poor people here and there. It doas seem to
me that we can only go so far in this way
until something breaks.
If oleomnargarine bas the qualities I arn told
it has, and can be produced for about forty
cents a pound, then I ask with ail sincerity
wby I sbould flot have it if I want it? In
my opinion it is as good as butter any day.
I have been reflccting on conditions in the
past. I recail that thirty-five years ago we
could buy the best of buckskin boots in Mr.
S. Carsley's dry goods store in Montreal for a
dollar a pair. Ladies' shoes were $1.10, and
boys' bouts ninety cents. I rccently bougbt a
pair of shoes in a Montreal store for $16.50.
You may think I arn crazy, but they were the
only ones that I liked. We used to be able
to buy a good suit of clothes for $25; now-

adays a suit costs $100 or $125. The fariner
does not have to dress up, so ha can save a
littie on that score.
Hon. Mr. HORNER: He can go in his
bare feet.
Hon. Mr. HUSHION: I should lîke to refer
briefly to the subi ect of bigher education. If
I had anytbing to do with the running of the
educational system. I would close al] the universities for two ycars, dlean them. out and look
around. Wby, in the city of Montrent we have
flot enough money to pay our teachers a decent
salary. Is there any sense to that? Some
cconomists or scientistm are telling us what to
do, and we arc going crazy on many matters.
Yet thousandýs arc going to universities and
are heing- turned out as scicntists.
Hon. Mr. DUFF: And Bolsheviks.
Hon. Mr. HUSHION: That is truc of a lot
of thcm.
Coming back to the question of margarine,
I must say that I admired the way in which
the honourable senator from. Waterloo (Hon.
Mr. Euler) presentcd bis case. I believe margarine is essential for the people who cannot
afford the luxury of butter. It is onJy right
that the bill should be passed, and I sinccrely
hope that bonourable members will giýve it
serious consideration, and pass it.
Hon. JAMES P. MeINTYRE: Honourabie
sanators, I bave listened witli a great deal of
attention to the bonourable members wbo
bave spoken on this bill to amend the Dairy
Industry Act. The bonourable senator from,
Waterloo (Hon. Mr. Euler) bas introduced the
bill for the third time in this bouse. I coinmend him for bis efforts to belp, as ha beliaves,
the consuming population in this country. I
do flot tbink anyone would find fault witb bim.
for what he is trying to do, but wa must not
forget that ha rapresents a consuming population in the city of Kitchener.
Hon. Mr. EULER: Not only 1<itchener.
Hon. Mr. McINTYRE: I also listaned witb
attention to the honourabla senator frein Aima
(Hon. Mr. Ballantyne), wbo is flot in bis seat
tonight. He too reprasents a consuming population, in the city of Montreai. No one wouid
find fauit with him. for the strong argument he
advanced in the interest of that population.
I was intarasted to bear the bonourable
gentleman from Aima say that he was born on
a farmn not far from this city, and that he ieft

the farmn at the aga of fiftean and moved to
Montrent. Latar, hae told us, he engaged in
dairy farming, and in partnership witb bis
brother man a farmn for aimost tbirty years. That

MAROR 8, 1948

should give hi.m some knowledge of the hardslips the dairy farmer and his help have to go
through to make the business pay. He further
mentioned that in the earlier days he coud
lire a man for $40 a month and board, but later
had to pay from three to five dollars a day.
This of course would add greatly to the cost of
the product.
Another honourable senator who spoke in
favour of the bill was the honourable
gentleman from Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr.
Roebuck), who represents a consuming *population in the city of Toronto. I do not think
anyone could find fault with bim for attempting to do something for the people he
represents.
Hon. Mr. HARDY: May I interrupt the
honourable gentleman to ask him if, in these
large and congested manufactuýring districts,
ample consideration should not be given to the
public?
Hon. Mr. McINTYRE: Certainly. I am
coming to that point.
The honourable gentleman from TorontoTrinity also said that he was born on a farm.
I assume that he left it at an early age, because
he went to school, and afterwards to law
sehool, where he graduated and became a
member of the bar, later becoming King's
Counsel, and finally Attorney General of his
native province. Now I feel that had the
honourable senator from Aima (Hon. Mr.
Ballantyne) and the honourable senator from
Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck) remained
in the dairy business, they would be here
fighting this bill with ail tbeir might instead of
supportîng it.
Representing an agricultural province, as I
do, I feel that I have as much right to uphold
the interests of the agricultural industry in my
province as have the honourable senators from
AIma and Toronto-Trinity to support the
consumer interests of their respective provinces.
When I spoke on this bill last year I had
resolutions from the dairy industry of Prince
Edward Island which I asked- to have placed
on Hanaard. I have received, similar resolutions this year from the same source, and with
the consent of the bouse I would put the
following on record:
W'hereas, the d.airy industry of Canada is
d'ivided into several different branches, the most
important of which are the fluid milk trade,
the manufacture of butter, eheese and concentr'ated milk prodncts,
And whereas. any action that m'ight be taken
that would interfere with the successful operatien of any of these branches could net belp
but react unfavour-ably upon the dairy industry.
And whereas, notwithstanding the scarcity of
and the high cost of f armn labour together with

197

the -advancing feed prices, the production of
butter in Canada increased in, 1947 by twenty
million pounds,
And whereas, if given f air chance, -a further
effort will be made during the current session
to, bridge the gap between production and
the very high consumption of butter in Canada,
And whereas, lucrative prices are being
offered for good dairy cows and heifers for
expert from Canada,
And whereas, the whole industry la dependent upon the encouragement given farmers te
build up and maintain. a high standard of dlairy
herds and soil balance in Canada,
Therefore, be it resolved that we, the Prince
Edward Island Dairymen's Association, wish to
go on record as being strongly opposed to, the
present bills introduced in the House of Commens and Senate at Ottawa, hiaving for their
objeet the manufacture and sale of oleomnargarine in Canada,
And be it f-urther resolved, that a copy of
thIS resointion be forwarded to the several
mnembers of parliamnent and senators f'romn Prince
Ed'ward Island wi.th the object of securing
their support in defeating the said bills.
Signed on beh.aîf of,
Prince Edwvard Island Dairymen's Assn.
J. H. Myers, President.
S. C. Wright, Secretary.
As you know, Prince Edtward Island, is a
dairy province, in that the livelibood of a
considerable part of the population depends
on dairying. I am opposed te any action
wbicb will tend te lessen the revenues of the
daîry farmers of Prince Edward Island. But
net only they are affected: haîf a million
farmers throughout Canada will suifer a great
injustice if the importation or the manufacture
of oleomargarine is allowed in Canada. Why
do I say this? Because the population of
this country is not large enough te absorb the
production of oleomargarine as well as available supplies of butter. Canada bas only a
little over 12,000,000 people. Our neîghbours
to the south, who manufacture oleomargarine,
number over 140 million. Newfoundland,
where oleomargarine is also manufactured, is
not an agricultural. country at ahl. In the
United States and in Newfoundland the
manufacture of oleomargarine does net harm
the dairy industry in the slightest degree.
Hon. Mr. HUSHION: May I ask a question
of the honourable gentleman?
Hon. Mr. McINTYRE: Certainly.
Hon. Mr. HUSHION: Is butter production
the largest industry of Prince Edward Island?
Hon. Mr. MeINTYRE: It may not be, but
it is one of the largest. I believe our largest
production is potatoes.
Hon. Mr. HUSHION: It seems te me that,
with parsnips selling at $4.50 a baîf bushel,
potatoes at $2.50 per bag of 75 pounds, car-

SENATE

rots at $3.50 a bushel, and loose-leaf lettuce
at $7.50 to $8 for three dozen, the farmer is
not suffering very much.
Hon. Mr. MeINTYRE: The honourable
senator must remember that in the last few
years the pay cheque of the consumer has
been greatly increased.
Hon. Mr. HUSHION: That is true of everybody.
Hon. Mr. McINTYRE: Then, if the consumer has substantially increased his earnings,
is it not reasonable that the dairy farmer, who
has to pay more for his hired help, as well as
for his fertilizers and everything that goes into
the production of his commodities, should
receive a corresponding increase in his returns?
Hon. Mr. EULER: But why should the
consumer be forced to buy butter?
Hon. Mr. McINTYRE: New Zealand, which
manufactures oleomargarine, has to sell her
butter at cheap rates to other countries.
Hon. Mr. EULER: Every country except
Canada makes oleomargarine.
Hon. Mr. MeINTYRE: Far be it from me
to advocate anything which would do an
injustice to the consuming population, including the little children that my honourable
friend from Alma (Hon. Mr. Ballantyne) says
are undernourished. But every city and town
across Canada contains a certain number of
poor-extremely poor-people. Although they
are a part of the consuming population, their
percentage is very small, and it is the duty of
the cities and the provincial governments to
come to their aid.
Hon. Mr. HUSHION: The honourable senator from Mount Stewart (Hon. Mr. MeIntyre)
has said that the farmer has to pay more. In
Montreal the average labouring man who is
not in a union of any kind, but who would
not be called a poor man looking for charity,
gets about 70 to 75 cents an hour for a 45hour week.
Hon. Mr. McINTYRE: I was in Montreal
in 1923 when pictures of my honourable friend,
who was running in an election for the House
of Commons, were on the posts. At that time
wages in Montreal were only from 25 to 30
cents an hour. Wages now are much higher.
Is it not reasonable, now that these workers
are getting 70 cents an hour instead of the 25
or 30 cents they received when my honourable
friend was running for election in 1923, that
the dairy farmer should get an increase?
Hon. Mr. HUSHION: I think the honourable gentleman is mistaken in that statement,

because I do not remember that at that time
anybody was working for 25 cents an hour.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Order.
Hon. Mr. HUSHION: I know a little about
wages, because I brought in the first budgets
which were presented to the Council of the
City of Montreal and the Legislature of
Quebec to increase the wages of these working
men. At that time they were getting about
40 cents, and I tried to get them a little more.
Hon. Mr. MeINTYRE: If they were getting 40 cents at that time, they have now
advanced to 70 cents, so that an increase in
the returns of the dairy farmers would be only
reasonable. My honourable friend from Alma
(Hon. Mr. Ballantyne) said that whereas he
hired men at one time for $40 a month, he
now has to pay them from three to five dollars
a day.
Canada, to ship her butter to other countries,
bas to ship at a very cheap rate. We all remember what happened in the campaign of 1930
when New Zealand was shipping her butter
into Canada. In 1930 we were paying 20
cents a pound for butter, and, as my honourable friend from Saskatchewan has said, we
could even buy it for 15 cents a pound. The
slogan at that time was, "Farmers, look at
your milk cheques". I do not know if that
slogan went all over Canada, but it certainly
was heard all over the province of Prince
Edward Island. It was the result of New
Zealand butter being shipped into Canada.
With only a little over 12 million consumers
in Canada what will happen here if the manufacture of oleomargarine is allowed? Can we
come down to a price of 15 or 18 or 20 cents
again for butter?
I have said that I have great regard for the
consuming population of this country, and I
would not do anything to injure them. But
there is an argument both ways. There is a
strong argument for this bill, but there is also
a strong argument against it. In these circumstances, I say, leave well enough alone.
When the revenue of the farmer in this country is lessened it affects every industry in the
land.
Some Hon. SENATORS:

Hear, hear.

And with *what
Hon. Mr. McI'NTYRE:
result? The result is stagnation and unemployment, and everyone in every line of
work-in commerce, in the mines and forests
and everywhere else-is affected. When the
farmer does not get a reasonable price for
his product or when there is a crop failure
he is the first to feel the pinch, but eventually
it extends to every industry in the country.

On the Orders of the Day:
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Honourable senators, I should like to make two suggestions
with respect to our procedure in the immediate future.
This afternoon the honourable senator fromn
Van-couver South (Hon. Mr. Farris) will move
the second reading of Bill 3, an Act respecting
Emergency Measures for the Conservation of
Canadian Foreign Exchange Resources. I have
consulted with the leader of the opposition
(Hon. Mr. Haig), who wishes to adjourn the
debate after the honourable gentleman from
Vancouver South (Hon. Mr. Farris) has
spoken. That is quite agreeable to me, but
after the leader of the opposition makes his
remarks I should appreciate it if other honourable senators would. arrange to carry on discussion of the bill until it hias been, resolved
one way or the other. My reason for suggcsting this proce dure is that there is éither
bcfore us or in prospect for the next two
weeks a good deal of legishation, and I arn
desirous thýat we should make as much progress
as possible.
Another mensure to which I wish to refer
is Bill E-S, an Act to amend the Canada
Shipping Act, 1934, which honourable senators
Nvill note is on the Order Paper for second
reading tomorrow. This is a most important
piece of legishation, and undoubtedly will
involve ýconsiderable discussion i. this bouse
nnd frequent meetings in committee. I urged
my colleagues to permit this measure to be
introduced in the Senate. At the snme time
I suggested thnt the Minister of Transport
should avail himself of the opportunity
nfforded by the change in our rules, as passed
hast session, and should appear before us nnd
present his legishation.
Notwithstnnding the fact that Bill E-S
appears on the ýOrder Paper for second reading
tomorrow, I should like honourable senators
to continue the discussion on Bill No. 3
ýuntil we have resolved it nnd referred it, as
we no douht shaîl do. to a committee.
I have given considerable thought to nnd
have constulted His Honour tle Speaker about
the proper procedure te be followed when the

MARCH 9, 1048
Minister of Transport comes Vo this bouse.
This will be the firat occasion of its kind.
For information of honourable senators, I
may say that wbat I propose is this. On the
day on wbich the bonourable minister is to
come bere, just before the order is called by
the Clerk I shaîl retire fromn the chamber and
escort the minister in and introduce bim Vo the
Speaker, and then escort bira to tbe chair on
my lefV. His Honour tbe Stpeaker will then
welcome the minister, noV onhy on bis own
bebaif but on bebaîf of other ministers wbo
rnay fol'low bim in tbe future.
Hon. Mr. DUFF: Should we noV have a
band to accompany the minister?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: That will be lefV
Vo the ingenuity of bonourable senators.
I will then move tbe second reading of the
bill and ask the honourable minister to deal
witb it.
Honourable senators, I do noV intend Vo
imphy Vbat tbe proposai I have outlined sbould
set a precedent for ahi similar occasions.
Hereafter it would be sufficient for me, on the
calling of Vhe order, to retire from the
cbamber and escort the minister Vo bis seat,
when he would bow Vo the Speaker, and
proceed witbout further formality.
Hon. M.r. ROEBUCK: M'ay I ask wbetber
this bill bas been distributed? Honourable
senators should bave copies of it before the
minister comes here.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I was under the
impression that the bill 'had already been distributed, but I am informed now that copies
are noV yet available fer distribution. I assure
my bonourable friend, 'bowever, that the bill
will be in the hands of -all bonourable members of this 'bouse before the discussion on
second reading takes place.
Hon. JOHN T. HAIG: Honourable members, I know that this question is noV debat-

able at this stage, but the

practiCe

of tbis

bouse bas always been Vo allow the leader of
the opposition Vo comment on sucb matters
as this.
The bil' appears on the Order Paper for
second reading tomorrow. At that time I
shail be ready Vo go on with the debate. I
ama just as 'anxious as my bonourable friend
Vo bave tbis matter brought to a conclusion as
soon as possible. Legislation that is somewbat
dependent upon tbis arrangement is Vo come
forward, and it would be inconvenient -if it
were before us wben we were discussing this
change. Nowadays, as in the past, ou-r best
work is dune in committee, where 'a deputy
niinister or soine other appropriate officiai can
gttend and give bis views.

201

But what I wish Vo refer to particularly is
the statement of the honourable leader that
this bouse, by amending its rules, allowed a
minister of the Crown to corne into this
chamhpr and speak. I care nôt what amendment of our rules we make. By the British
North Ainerica Act the Parliament of Canada
is constituted in three divisions,--Vbe Gavernor General, the Senate and the buse, of
'Commons; anid there is no precedent that I
have ever heard of or been able to find foT
permitting a member of one house to enter
ýanother bouse and, address its members witbout their unanimous consent.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: Surely, Mr. Speaker,
'this is out of order.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: As leader of the opposition 1 'have the right to make a statement.
The leader of the government 'bas the samne
right, and bie bas exercised it.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: The leader of the goverament merely made an an-nouncement of
procedure. The leader of 'the opposition is
now discussing an amendment which was
passed st session.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: In fairness -to the goverument there sbould be an explanation. If the
government wants me to sit down, I shall;
but it will be the firat time that I have been
asked to do su. If the bonourable member
for Vancouver South (Hon. Mr. Farris) asks
me Vo sit down I shall do so; but, in the
thirteen years that I have been here it has
always been tbe practice, wben tbe leader of
the government bas made a statement, to
permit the leader of the opposition to, make
a statement in reply. That is the practice
also in the other place and in every parliament
tbat I bave ever beard of.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: My objection la not
Vo the honourable gentleman making a statenient about procedure, but to bis discussing tbe principle of a rule wbicb was passed
hast session.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: But if I 'do not do it
nowHon. Mr. FARRIS: You sbould have dune
it iast session.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: -I do not know when I
shall bave a chance to tell the government
wbere I stand.
If bonourable members
opposite still want to go abead, tbey can;
we are a minority and cannot stop tbemn. I
believe that in fairness Vo the government
and Vo 'this bouse I sbould make it clear wbere
we stand. It may be that my friends opposite
do flot wisb to hear our views, but I may tell

SENATE

thern tbat I shahl certainly make proceedings
as difficuit as I know how, if, as one of the
leaders of the opposition, I amrn ot allowed
to state rny stand on a question which affects
the wbole house. I repeat, however, that if
the house does not want to hear me I arn
willing to sit down.
Sorne Hon. SENATORS: Go ahead.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I arn not dehating the
question; that can be done when it cornes up.
I arn expressing the view of our party in this
bouse, that nu person except a dully appointed
member of the Senate, who bas taken the oath,
cao speak bere without tbe unanirnous consent of this bouse. Tbe rninister or bis deputy
can corne in bere and sit in fr-ont of the
leader; then, when I ask a question the leader
can answer it or be can ask tbe visîtiog minister or tbe deputy for information. Tbat is
in accordance witb the practice in tbe bouse
of Commons and in every otber legisiative
body. As 1 bave said, I care flot wbat amendment bas been made: only a senator can speak
in tbis bouse, except by unanimous consent.
Hon. Mi. CAMPBELL: In view of tbe fact
that the amendment of tbe rule was passed,
does the leader opposite fot propose to abide
by tbe rules?
Hon. Mr, HAIG: You cannot by arnendment of the rules make a man a mernber of
tbe Senate.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: Nobody proposes that.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Only the government can
appoint a senator.
Hon. Mr. CAMPBELL: The leader of the
opposition mnust admit that tbe rules were
amendedHon. Mr. HAIG: Against my opposition.
Hon. Mr. CAMPBELL: -to permit a member of tbe government to speak in this cbamber. Does tbe leader of the opposition say
that he is not bound by that?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I say tbat tbe fundamental
constitution of tbis bouse cannot be changed
by an amendrnent of -tbe rules.
Tbe Hon.
tbe
ACTING
SPEAKER:
Honourable senators, I think tbe amendment
was unanimously adopted by this bouse hast
year.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: No, I opposed it.
Tbe Hon. the ACTING SPEAKER: I wvill
read tbe new rule su tbat it may be thorougbly
iunderstood. Rule iSA reads:
When a bill or other matter relating to any
qubject administered by a department of the

Government of Canada bas originated in and
is being considered, by the Senate or in Coinmîittee of the Wbole, a minister representing
tbe department, flot being a member of the
Senate, may enter tbe Senate chamber, and,
subject to tbe rules, orders, forms of proceedings, and usages of tbe Senate, take part in the
debate.
Tbis, it seems to me, is clear.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I arn puinting out that I
objected last year and divided the bouse. The
amendment was flot, unanirnously passed.
Tbe Hon. tbe ACTING SPEAKER: It was
passed.
Hon. Mr. HA'IG: But flot unaninmously.
Tbe Hon. the ACTING SPEAKER: It is
now a rule of tbis bouse.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I' admit that; but even
if twenty rules ýwere passed it would not permit
a member of another bouse to corne here wben
this bouse is in session and make a speech. If
a totally new rule book was made' tomorrow
and ail the people in Canada were told they
could corne and make a speech in the Senate,
tbey stihi could not do so.
Hon. Mr. DUPUIS: May I ask the leader
of the opposition if he considers the ruie
passed last year unconstitutionai?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: My point is tbat it is not
a question of a rule but one of the constitution.
Under the constitution it is provided that only
senators miay speak in the Senate, and nohody
ele bas any right to do so. Anyone other than
a senator who appears hore will be a stranger
on tbe flour, and I will ask to have bim
removed. Tbat is my right.
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: I ask tbe bonourable
leader opposite (Hon. Mr. Haig) ýto quote tbe
constitution in support of bis statement.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: The Britisb North Amorica
Act originally provided that the Senate should
be composed of seventy-two members. Later
the number was inereased to ninety-six. That
is tbe provision witb respect to the number of
senators, and no one sbould corne here wbo
is not a sýenator. I arn not going to take any
furtber tiine, hecatise thiere is a good deal to
be said for tbe suggestion of my honourable
friend from South Vancouver (Hon. Mr
Farris).
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: I wish to bave the
sittuation clarified. If this question is to be
raised,. it shouid be debated. I have a great
deal that I should, like to say on this question,
but this is not the time to say it.
Hon. Mr. CAMPBELL: I sbould like an
answer ta the question I put to the honour-

able leader opposite as to whether or nlot he
is willing to be bouncb by the rule that has
been passed, and to permit the Ministe!r of
Transport to be present and to diseuse the
bill in question.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: My answer is nlo.
Hon. Mr. CAMPBELL: Then I shall ask
a second question. Does the honourable
leader propose ta take objection when the
Minister of Transport appears on the floor of
this house?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I d'o.
I thank the honourable memabers for having
listened to me. 1 appreciate the courtesy they
have extended, to me in allowing me to make
this statement. I madje the statement because
I wanted the leader of the government (Hon.
Mr. Robertson) and other honourable senators to know that there is opposition, to this
procedure.
H-on. Mr. ROEBUCK: Honourable senatore,
it sSims to me that the leader opposite should
take one position or the other.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I did.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: 'Oh, no, you did not.
Hon. Mr. MORAUD: Honourable senatore,
I rise on a point *of order. If this matter is
to he debated-, we should be so informed, go
that everyone who wishes to take part may
be prepared- ta do so. As I understand our
procedure, the leader on each sidie makes a
statem-ent anid that is the end of it.
The Hon. the ACTING SPEAKER: That
is correct. There is nothing hefore the house
to be formally debated.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: I should like to ask
a question. The leader of the opposition has
not made his position clear, and I should like
himi to do so.

MORAUD:

Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: If the leader of the

the groundi that it is unconstitutional, he
should let us know, go that we will be ready
to debate that point tomorrow.

that is hie position.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I anewered that question

EMERGENCY EXCHANGE
CONSERVATION BILL
SECOND

READING

On the Order:
Second Re.ading of Bill 3 an -act respecting
Emergency Measuree for the Conservation of
Canadian Foreign Exchange Resources.
Hoft. Mr. ROBERTSON: I have asked the
honourable senator from Vancouver (Hon.
Mr. Farris) to hand-le this bill.
Hon. J. W. d*eB. FARRIS: Honourable
senators, I move the second reading of this
bill.
Hon. Mr. ROEBIJCK: Ras this bill been
distributed?
Some Hon. SENATORS: Yes.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: Honourable senators,
I regard this bill as an exceedingly important
piece of legisiation, not only as it stands in its
present form but in its implications and the
problemes it raises in connection with the
future policy of this country.
The purpose of the bill ie set forth ini its
title :-"ýAn .Act respecting Emergency Measuires for the Conservation of Canadian Foreign
Exchange Resources". For the purposes of the
bill the terni "Canadian Foreign Exchange
Resources" means the American dollar. In
short, this je legisiation of an emergency
nature to conserve American dollars in relation to the exchange of currencies in the
world, and particularly as between Canada
and the United States. The method adopted
in the bill is a direct one, as I shahl explain a
little more fully in a moment.
I think the first thing that should be considered je the need for what je termed
"iemergency legislation". This matter should
be looked at from three periods of time. Prior
to the war the problem. of foreign exchange
and the American dollar was on our hands.
The balance of trade was generally in favour
of Canada. But long before the war the
balance of trade as between this country and
the United States was heavily against Canada.
That was taken care of very largely, however.
by a triangular situation: what we bought
from the United States we paid for in large
measure by money received for what we eold
to Great Britain. As long as Great Britain
was able to pay us in dollars, which we could
use i the United States, there was no difficulty for this country. Then the war came
on, and with it real dificulties. During the

SENATE

war the situation was solved very largely as
a result of what is called the Hyde Park agreement, but for which I think the correct term
is the Hyde Park declaration. The Prime
Minister of Canada went down and saw the
President of the United States at his home
in Hyde Park, in the State of New York,
and they talked things over and decided on a
policy. That policy was afterwards declared
by those two public men, and it had a tremendous influence on not only our foreign
exchange relations but on the whole conduct
of the war.
With the many problems that are arising,
it is easy to lose sight of things after two or
three years, and I think probably all of us
have to some degree lost sight of the real
importance and significance of the Hyde Park
declaration. Therefore I looked up in Hansard
the speech that the Prime Minister made in
another place on April 28, 1941. Honourable
members will recall what Canada's situation
was at that time. The United States had net
come into the war then; it did not come in
until December of 1941. I should like to read
a short extract from the Prime Minister's
statement, first because of its importance in
connection with this matter with which we are
dealing; and second, because I think it will
help to refresh our minds as to what was
happening in those days and give us a better
understanding of the vision that the public
men of these two countries had. I am reading
from the Commons Hansard of 1941, page
2289:
For Canada, the significance of the Hyde
Park declaration may be summarized briefly as
follows: first, it will help both Canada and the
United States to prov.ide maximum aid to
Britain and to all the defenders of democracy;
second, it will increase the effectiveness of Canadia's direct war effort; and finally, through the
increased industrial efficiency whieh will result,
it will increase our own security and the
securi.ty of North America.
Just a few moments before that the Prime
Minister had said:
The agreement will go a long way towards the
solution of the exchange problem -and, in this
way, will remove one of the financial obstacles
to the maximum war production program of
Canada and ,the United States.
That prediction was wonderfully fulfilled,
honourable senators.
And here are the Prime Minister's concluding words:
The Hyde Park declaration is, I believe, a further convincing demonstration that Canada and,
the United States are indeed laying the enduring foundations of a new world order, an order
based on international understanding, on mutual
aid, on friendship and good will.

However regrettable it may be that the
example of that declaration has not caught
on as it should have in the rest of the world,
there is no doubt that it bas continued to be
effective between these two countries on the
North American continent. And we pray that
it may long continue.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: Now, honourable
senators, looking at the purely financial aspects
of this declaration, I would remind the bouse
that as a result of our association with the
United States and our great wartime production, we had after the war, and as late as
January 1, 1946, a surplus of $14 billion in
American funds. When the war ended, the
effect of the Hyde Park declaration also
ended, but the problem of foreign exchange
remained.
That problem was not overlooked. I am
glad to be able to remind honourable senators
of the discussion bef ore our Banking and Commerce Committee, when Mr. Graham Towers
appeared before it in August 1946. In the
light of what has happened since, and because
of some of the criticisms that are being made
at the present time, I think a couple of short
extracts from what Mr. Towers said at that
time would be interesting. After referring to
the surplus, he made these remarks:
I do not think that these admittedly Large
holdings of gold and United States dollars
should lull us into the belief that our position
is an impregnable one.

Our high level of employment and national
income, and, the backlog of deferred consumers'
buying, inevitably result in a tremendous demand for imports, most of which have te be
paid for in U.S. dollars. On the other hand, a
very substantial volume of our exports is financed on credit, and from these exports we earn
no U.S. dollars. Predictions are dangerous
things, and I would not care to make a definite
estimate of our current account deficit in U.S.
dollars over the course of the next two years.
But I can go so far -as to express the opinion
that it would, not be surprising if the deficit
for the two-year period was half a billion
dollars or more.
It follows from what I have said that we
may well see a red,uction of more than $600
millions in our U.S. holdings over the course of
the next two years. It might even be the
case that our holdings of gold and U.S. dollars
were eut in half.
Honourable members will see that the government have not been going at this matter
blind, but that their financial experts have
been warning of the situation for the last
couple of years.
Let me emphasize that I do not wish to name
these figures as a definite prediction, but simply
to say that the outlook at the present time is
for drafts on Our resources of the order of mag-

MARCHI 9, 1948
nitude whicli I have mentioned. These figures
assume continuance of control over exporte of
capital. If we do not control exporte of capital,
a hast of new uncert-ainties appears on the
scene.
Canada je a debtor country. Canad.a' foreign debt is substantiýally larger than that of
any other coun'try in the world if one excepte
the w.ar debts ineurred by the Un.ited Kingdomn
in the form cf aecumulated sterling balances.
A very large portion of Can'ada's foreign: delit
je in the formi of negotiable securities in the
hande of non-residente. These holdings in the
United States rirn to billions of dollars.
That was the situation two years ago. Then
last November the Minister of Finance told
the Huse of Commons that of our reserve of
$l.ý billion in United States dollars only $500

million remained. Two-thirds of it had goneconsiderably more than even Mr. Graham
Towers had anticipated.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Twice as much.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: The trend je significant.
In. 1946 our surplus of $1J billion was reduced
by $250 million, and, in eleven months of 1947
-that wss the period te which Mr. Abbott
referred-another $750 million was dissipated.
In other words, our reserve was reduced by Si

billion in two years; and three-quarters of that
reduction occurred last year.
Ahl honourable senators know the reasen
for this situation, but the reason for the reason
is another question. The immediate reason
was that we were short large sume of cash
from the United States, and we were selling
te the United Kingdom and other countries
on the basis of a credit that could not be converted

into

United

States

dollars.

For

instance, in 1946 our total favourable balance
of trade, including certain securities purchased
in Canada, was $60 million; but for the saine
period we lied eold goods te the United Kingdom te the value of $860 million, on crediýt
which. was flot convertible. That left us with
a deficit which was a drain on our United
States dollars to the extent cf $260 million.
In 1947 there wae a disproportionate balance
of trade, -to the saine or an even greater
extent, between our ealee te the United Kingdom and our purchases fromn the United States.
Our shortage cf American dollars wae then
$750 million.
I should caîl the attention of honourable
member te the fact that this unfavourable
position was flot due te any lack cf trade or
business. Our problem was exactly that cf a
businessmnan whoee business becomes so
unexpectedly large that it dissipates hie reserve
of available capital. The value cf commoditiee exported in the eleven. montbis cf 1947
exceeded eur experts for the same period of
1946 by 19 per cent.

205

Hon. Mr. EULER: How mucli dees that
amount to in our money?

Hon. Mr. FARRIS: I have net worked that
out, but I have given you the figures. In 1917
our importe exceeded those of 1946, not, by 19
per cent, but by 36 per cent. It will be seen
therefore, that our business was expanding;
but while our exporte increased 19 per cent,
our importe increased 36 per cent. It was this
excessive buying in the United States that
created the deficit in 1946, and whicli doubled
in amount in 1947.
Now, honourable senators, what was the
result? I have already ehown you how our
position resembled that of a businessman. The
amazing part cf the situation wus tliat there
was water, water everywliere, and net a drap
ta drink. Notwitlistanding the tremendous
advance in business, Canada was faced with
the problem. of immediately mending lier
financial. ways or going broke. It mean-t going
broke in a land of plenty, where the more
business you did in the way in which you were
doing it the woree off you were.
We are now faeed with the remedy, whicli
for the time being is termied an emergency
remedy. It was first dealt with by an order
in council which operated until parliament
was called last December. Since that time
this measure lias been under advisement, and
it will, when pa.ssed, supersede the order in
council, whicli was paissed under tlie Fereign
Exchiange Control Act. Honourable members
of this body have every messon te remember
tliat Act by reason cf the very spirited discussion and the many amendmente made to
the measure before i-t passed this lieuse.
1 should like lionourable senatore te considex
witli me briefiy some explanations of the bill

new before us and of the way it operates.
Section 3 (1) provides that goode shaîl net

be imported excepting on a perrmit. There are
three echedules established under whicli there
are three metliods cf control. Under Scliedule

I there are prohibitions, under Scliedule II
quotas, andî under Sehedule III regulations.
May I analyze that provision hriefly?
First, let us look at section 4 cf the bill,
dealing witli goods in Schedule I, whicli reads

as follows:
No permit shail lie iseued for the import cf
gooes listed in. Schedule 1 unless, in the opinion

of the Miniater, exceptional liardsliip would re-

sult if -a permit 'were net issued.

Seliedule 1, com-mencing at page 6, sets eut

a description cf the goods. I nieed net read
the list, but 1 note that it refers te meas.t,

ginger, yeast, cakes, table saits, biscuits and
se forth. I do ]Met -&ee anY -refèrence te
margarine.

SENATE

Hon. Mr. EULER: You will.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: Schedule II deals with
quotas. The goods are listed in five categories: fruits and vegetables; textiles; leather
goods of various kinds; clocks,.cutlery and
other things of that nature, and lastly a miscellaneous list of prepared foods.
I have no advice on the basis for the working out of quotas, but from my own study it
would appear to work this way. First, as to
fruits and vegetables, the national quota is
arrived at on the basis of what we imported in
the year before the war. We then calculate
what percentage of the imports of that year we
should allow Canada as a whole in the year
1948. Of course requirements have gone up
tremendously. It may be that in certain cases
the quota should be 200 per cent of what was
brought in during the year before the war.
We then break down the national quota into
individual quotas and a person, who was in
business last year is entitled to a quota of so
much based on the amount he imported for
the year ending June 30, 1947.
I have given a rather sketchy explanation
of Schedules I and Il which probably is not
very lucid, but if honourable senators will
turn to the Hansard of the other bouse, at
pages 333 to 336, they will there find Honourable Mr. Abbott's explanation in more detail.
They can then work it out for themselves and
see how many mistakes I have made.
We now come to Schedule III, which is
based, not on quotas or prohibitions, but on
regulations, although a considerable number
of prohibitions come into it. Thiz schedule
covers capital goods. The regulations for the
importation of capital goods are under the
control of the Minister of Trade and Commerce. The reason for that, I take it, is that
capital goods relate to commodities that are
brought into Canada not for the purpose of
resale, such as a pair of shoes, but ta be used
in Canada in some way for the manufacture of
other goods for resale to the United States.
May I illustrate? I am familiar with a large
power project which is in process of dievelopment in British Columbia. There has been
a shortage of power in the lower mainland of
that province, and at the present time we are
borrowing or renting power from the State of
Washington. This development is the basis
for the production of power in that part of
Canada, and the machinery and equipment
that goes into it must be secured in the United
States. It is, therefore, regardedi as a capital
investment.
In trying ta stop the flow of United States
dollars, you cannot possibly afford ta eut off
your nose to spite your face. You will appreciate that the importation of essential capital

goods which contribute to our industrial
development must not be 'unduly checked.
Such importations are not limited to finished
machinery; they also include tools fabricated
for machinery, and such essential raw products
as steel and, on occasion, coal, gas and other
elements which must be imported if our
industrial life is to go on and we are to earn
American dollars. Honourable senators can
see that a question of this complexity cannot
be settled off-hand by parliament, because
parliament is not sufficiently qualified. The
only course is to put this matter under the
control of men who can deal with each individual case as it comes up; and it bas been
decided, rightly or wrongly, that while the
regulations under this Act are in operation
their administration shall be vested in the
Minister of Trade and Commerce. In the
result there will be no substantial restrictions
on essential machinery or essential raw materials which are required for the purposes I
have mentioned.
It is also proposed under this bill ta make
arrangements ta extend the manufacturing of
parts, and for the sale of such parts in the
United States. I confess, honourable senators,
that I am not qualified to elaborate on that
proposal, but I will mention enough about it
to interest you, perhaps, in pursuing the question further.
Today we import or use certain parts in the
manufacture of machinery in Canada. Whatever resentment the individual merchant may
feel about what is going on under these necessary provisions, those in charge of government
in the United States clearly recognize that
Canada is their best customer, and that she
will not continue to be unless she is enabled,
in co-operation with that country, ta reorganize her finances and ber industry in such a
way that she may continue to do as she bas
done hitherto. I understand, from the casual
reading I have been able to do in this regard,
that new activities are to be developed in
co-operation with the United States in order
that parts of essential machinery can be
manufactured in Canada for sale not only in
Canada but directly in the United States, for
the purpose of bringing more American dollars
into this country. Furthermore, the Minister
of Trade and Commerce, with his departmental experts, will be enabled to restrict the
importation of capital goods which are not
immediately needed for our productive purposes. For example, a man is housing his
goods in a warehouse which, although usable,
is old, and he wants to import steel girders
and many other things to build a new one.
The answer will be, "No; the erection of this
building would not contribute a dollar to the

MARCH 9,109a6
manufacture or production of new goods to
be sold in the -United States. That type of
construction must be deferred". That would
seem to me a sensible decision.
In this eonnection 1 would quote a paragraph from a speech madle in another place
by Hon, C. D. Howe, the Minister of Trade
and Commerce, as repoyrted at page 389 of
Hansard. H1e said that the policy was not
only to restriet imports, butto give energetie and effective encouragement te
the development of -our natural resourees of
mines, forests and fields which will find a market
in the United States, and to the expansion of
manuf.acturing industries that ivili lie able to
compete in the Un.ited States.
I think I have now said ail I need say about
the mnechanies of this bill. Though mny explanatien may net have been very lucid, 1 think it
will serve the purpose in opening thie discussion on this measure.
Concurrently with this bill certain remedies
are being proposed. One is the imposition of
some new excise taxes. I will not now go into
details. I have no doulit that on the budget
or at some other stage this legisiation will
be fully explained. But we may well take notice
of the strenuous criticisms whicli have been
macle that these excise taxes were imposed
before parliament met, and the extravagant
assertions that this is taxation without representation, an insult, defiance of parliament, and
so on. Well, with ail due respect to the crities,
I do not think there is anything to justify
theiýr statements.
A similar principle is
followed every year in connection witli the
budget. Wlien things of this kind are to be
done, the only way is to do tliem and anneunce
themn afterwards. Otherwise their very purpose
will lie clefeated through extravagant and
unfair importations by people who want to
"beat the gun."
The point is that almost immediately after
this order in council was passed parliament
was summoned and the wliole, matter was
placed before it. If the government's procedure was held to lie a fiouting of the people's
representatives, or subversive of democracy,
the proper course would have been to move
a vote cf want of confidence in the government
the very fi.rst day that parliament met, ancl
upon that assumption, within two or three days
the government might have been turned out
of office. I suggest, and I know the suggestion
will be sympatlietically received in this house,
that the problemn is of such importance that,
whule controversial ini the sense that thinking
men will have different icleas about it, contreversy sliould be kept within the bounds of
what will lie the best policy for Canada, and
that extravagant statements and the conjur-

ing up of hysterical notions should be discouraged, for though they may sound well on
the hustings they certainly do not contribute
to the solution of wliat is essential to the best
interests of the Canadian people.
The success of the measures which have been
adopted in this emergency fashion is not yet
fully cleronstrated, but it is indîcated in two
ways: by the complaints which are heardwhich show that the system is working; ancl
by the figures which Mr. Abbott was able te
give in the House of Commons on Febru-ary
10. H1e then stated as reported in Hansard,
page 738:
At the end of November, -as I thinli I have
already reported te the lieuse, reserves had
f allen te approximately $480 million, and the
deeline w-as then con.tinuing. On December 17
the low point was reached of just under $441
million. However, we ended the year 1947 with
total holdings of $502 million, aud at the close
of business yesterday, that is Thursday, January 29, our total holdings of gold and United
States dollars 'were approxiimately $514 million.
So far the policy lias stoppecl the drain, and
lieadway against tlie stream is being macle te
an extent whicli gives assurance that in due
time there will be favourable results. I asked
the Bank cf Canada for later figures; and
when I inquired cf Mr. Donald Gordon lie
said, "There is a provision in the Act wliereby
I would go te jail il 1 revealecl them." But I
do not think there is any reason to doulit that
the situatuon is still improving.
Now 1 want te, direct your attention to certain criticisms cf this measure. I do not think
there is a member of this lieuse wlio dees not
agree that the need. for contrels is an unfortunate thing. Every session we have a'll been
disappointed that there lias flot been more
oppertunity for tlie quieker eliminatien of
contrels. But existing conditions have te be
faced, and if there must be controls their
administration cannet be left entirely to parhiument because parliament is a legislative and
net an administrative body. Contrels would
neýt work out if we t.ried to settle tliem aIl in
advance. Many cf yeu, I think, will agree
wi-tl me that, if controls of this kind must be
maintained by this or 'any other goveru-ment,
Mr. Abbott and Mr. H-owe are about as
experieneced and as well qualified to give
efficient service es any two men in Canada.
Honourable senators, I do not feel that
what is being done in this emergency wil-l in
any way undermine eur Ca-nadian way of if e
or our ideas of demecracy. I arn concerned,
however, about every step we take in the way
cf control in relation te the policy of
socialismn in Canada. As I see it, the Canadian people, represented by the Liberal and
Conservative parties, carried on these contraIs

SENATE

during the war because they knew they were
essential. They are now continuing to carry
thom on as an after-war condition. The best
we can say about them is that they are a
necessary evil. But the CCF party scems to
like controls for the sake of control. A control
system is implicit and basic in the policy
which the CCF party wishes to make permanent in Canada. For that reason my only concern about this emergency measure in relation
to Canada's permanent policy is that people
may think, "Weli, if a little is good, a great
deal is better". Wben I hear anyone offer
that suggestion I like to quote what I quoted
in the sane connection in this house before:
Vice is a monster of so frightful mien,
As to be hated needs but to be seen;
Yet seen too oft, familiar with her face,
We first endure, then pity, then embrace.
Honourable senators, if the time ever contes
when we in this country learn to embrace controls for their own sake, and in order that
everything may be handled by the government,
we invade the field of private enterprise and
take it away from the men who are best qualified to develop it, that will be a sorry day for
Canada.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: There is another line
of attack whicb is being taken against this
particular remedy. A night or two ago in
Kingston Mr. Bracken said that this policy
was a tragedy of errors. I read very carefully the report of his remarks in the Montreal
Gazette and then I looked in the Ottawa
papers to see if I could find out what the
tragedy was, where the errors were and what
policy the government should have adopted.
I was not able to do this. However, in going
through various editorials and in reading
about the subject in other places I didi find
a suggestion, and I must say that I was somewhat bothered about it myself before I came
to Ottawa the last time. I read that the
government's mistake was made in July 1946,
when they pegged the Canadian dollar at par
with the American dollar and took off the
10 per cent difference. It was suggested that
the proper remedy was deflation. It has been
said that we should let nature take its course
and leave the Canadian dollar alone; that if
we use the Canadian dollar too extravagantly,
thereby imperilling our credit, the Canadian
dollar will go down in value and the problem
will finally adjust itself. I cannot see any
economic reason why, sooner or later, it would
not ad-just itself. In the very short time at
my disposal I have donc my best to study
this problem and find out if, after all, that is
the best vay to deal with it. I have been

impressed with some of the things Mr. Abbott
has said, and with what Sir Stafford Cripps
said last Friday respecting the situation in
Great Britain, where the problem is a great
deal more serions than ours. While I would
not want to accept the economic policy of a
socialist government, when it comes to a question of foreign exchange I feel that Sir
Stafford Cripps has consulted the best financial
crities on every side of politics in Great
Britain. There the matter is too serious to
play politics. In language that was almost
dreadful, Sir Stafford Cripps ropudiated any
suggestion of allowing the value of their
money to go down.
Mr. Abbott, in his speech, said that moderate inflation or deflation would not do the
trick. He statcd that the people of Canada
had been buying in the United States, regardless of the high prices there, and good Canadian dollars were being spent on American
goods. While admitting that substantial deflation might have the desired effect, Mr. Abbott
pointed ont its consequences. First, he said
that the deflation of money is in a substantial
way another fort of inflation. That is what
it must be. Therefore it would necessarily
increase our cost of living, particularly as
compared with the cost of living across the
border line. He did not elaborate this point
as much as I should have liked him to do.
To my mind the key to it all is that under
the proposed system the restrictions will fall
on the things we can get along without, and
not on the capital goods we must bring into
this country. Canada has to import such
natural products as cil, coal and steel. Deflation would hit those capital goods just as
hard as it would hit the goods we do not
need; it would fall on all commodities alike.
The result would be that if our dollar went
down tn, say, 75 per cent of its value, we
would be paying for everything we have to
bring in from the United States a percentage
of-how much?
Hon. Mr. HOWARD:
third per cent.

Thirty-three and a

Hon. Mr. FARRIS: The mathematician next
to me has answered the question. It would be
331 per cent. That being so, the 33* per cent,
together with the increased cost of labour,
would make the cost of our manufactured
products so excessive that they could not be
sold in the United States for a fair profit, and
the whole scheme would defeat itself.
It has been said that such a scheme would
be inconsistent with our international comitments. I cannot follow that. Honourable

MARCH 9, 1948
senators will recail what a furore was raised
in other countries just a short time ago
because France deval-ued its franc.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: But nothing happened.
Hon,. Mr. FARRIS: Another thing that was
pointed out by Mr. Abbott was that Amenican capitalists would take advantage of the
situation, and would corne in and buy o>ur
natural assets at bargain-counter prices. Mr.
Abbott, like myself, is a lawyer, and I do flot
believe that he devised these reasons out of
bis own wisdom; rather, I feel sure they are
reasons which he, as an efficient and competent
minister of the Crown, bas secured in consultation with the best financial advisers that
he can get--such men as Graham Towers,
Donald Gordon and Dr. Clark-and aliso with
a large number of men in private industry, who
have first-hand knowledge of how serious the
consequences would be fer Canada if we let
our dollar mun right downhill. Sirnilarly, Sir
Staff ord Cripps no doubt acted on the best
financial. advice available to hlm.
What is the ncxt criticism? Opponents of
the government say: "It is an outrage to
jurnp in and act suddenly like this. You ought
to have acted sooner." ln the first place, that
strikes me as being rather inconsistent, because
if a tbing is bad you ought to get credit for
putting off the d-oing of it for as long as you
could. I think the governmcnt's position in
this respect miglit be fairly compared to that
of a surgeon. Sometimes there is no doubt
about the need for a prompt operation-as
when a patient lias peritonitis, for example.
But in other cases there is flot that urgency,
and it is possible thst the patient will an
improve that an operation will flot be pecessary at all. In sucli cases the surgeon scratches
bis bead and confers with bis colleagues, and
it is decîded that ne barm will be done by
waiting for a wliile. Also, in certain cases
there is another reaeon for delaying an operation. The doctor says:- "This patient appears
to be in good bealtb. Re is a big, husky man,
and lie thinks there is not mucli wrong with
him. He is doing a fine business, and ln bis
present state of mind, if 1 advise hirn that it
is necessary to operate, he will be rebellious
and will not give the co-operation which is s0
essential to recovery."
The problem facing the government was
much like that. Suppose that a year ago the
government liad said, "We foresee that next
year the Canadian people are going to spend
more money than they can afford, so we are
going to put the clamps on now." Do bonourable, senators not agree that there would have
been sucli a roar in this country tliat the
goverument could not have got away with the
5853-15j

restriction? 1 suggest it would bave been
impossible to get away witb it not only politically, but effectively as an administrative
measure. So the government waited till it was
not safe to wait any longer. Tbey waited until
they could see, and the public of Canada could
see, that bowever unpleasant the restriction
rnight be there were grave and sufficient
reasons for imposing it. And I think that am
Canadians we can congratulate ourse-Ives upon
the rnost surprising co-operation there bas
been in the carrying out of this rather unpleasant but necessary procedure.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, bear.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: Honourable senators,
I arn sorry that I have taken so longSorne Hon. SENATORS: No, no.
Hon. Mn. FARRIS: -but, after ail, I think
this matten is of more than ordinary importance. 0f course, I always say that about
every matter that I discuss.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. HOWARD: You neyer speak
uniess the matter is important.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: Tlie next tbing we have
to bean in mind is that this is ernergency legislation, and that sooner or later it is going to
be fused. into a better and more permanent
policy. There must be a long-range policy
which will Iead, us out of the present difficulty
and make this ernergeney measure no longer
necessary. To my mmnd that is implicit ln our
consideration of this measure. If a doctor
advises you to sulimit te au operation, and at
the same time tells yen. that the operation itself
will be successful but you are going to die, you
will not see any point in baving the operation
performed. You will submit to it -only if be
can assure you that afterwards, perliaps by
making some necessary changes lu your
*metbods of living, you will he in better condition than before.
The question is, how long is this ernergency
going to last? There was a good deal of
controversy on that point in, auothen place.
There is a story told of Abraham Lincoln, that
once he was asked how long a mnan's leg sbould
be; and lie replied, "Long enougb ta reacli to
the ground." Well, I tbink we are ail agreed
that the life of this emergency legislation
should not 'be any longer than is necessary,
and that it should, fot become part of oun
permanent Canadian policy. I want to give
some reasons for that, because I think this
view is basic. It la not economically eound
for a young country that is progressive and
ambitious, and, lias great resources, to tie the
hands of its people lu thein trading witli their
closest and nichest neighbour.

SENATE

Some Hon. SENATORS:

Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. FARRIS: Let me quote from an
article in the London Economist of January 10,
this year:
The American way of life, or more accurately the North American standard of living,
is too d.eeply ingr.ained in Ganadian standards
of consumption and ways of business and processes of production; to eut off imports of
American products or components permanently
is unthinkable. Every American magazine, every
American radio broadcast, every American
visitor, that cornes across into Canada helps to
mould Canadi.an minds into thinking that anything much less lavish and luxurious than
American. standards is intolerable.
That review is published in England. Speaking as a Canadian, I would say that we do net
need American magazines or radio broadcasts
or visitors to bring home to us-a capable and
competent people, as good in every way as our
American neighbours-that anything less than
what is good enough for them is not good
enough for us. That accords with our goodneighbour policy. It is fundamental to our
North American way of life. and in my opinion
it, lias an economie. social and spiritual basis.
This North American continent, lionourable
senators, is an oasis of fricnidhip in a descrt
world tit
elsewhere is larkencd bY els
of
suspicion, and storm-wept with anîimoitie
and hatre<. That oa-i of friiad-hipx mu-t b
preserved at all cots and t al sacrifices.
Some

Hon. SENATORS:

Hnar, hear.

Hon. Mr. FARRIS: We are told that it is
not safe to hav coer t rade relations withi
the United States, that -we are in danger of
being dominaited by the Anierican Senate and
the House of Representatives. I do net think
I should like to sec Canada annexed to the
United States, although I am amazed at how
moany good Canadians are willing to have their
sons go over there and become annexed. However, those of us who stay here treasure our
institutions, our ideals and our traditions. But
I want to say this, honourable senators. that if
there is one thing that would increase in this
country the sentiment for annexati.on, it would
be a denial of our right of free traffic with our
friends and neighbours acrcss the border.
What I am saying to honourable senators is
that an essential part of this program of
emergency legislation is the contemporary
measure or its ultimate solution. It is that
part of the question that I am now asking you
to consider. What are the ultimate solutions?
One suggestion is that the reconversion of the
pound and the other so-called "soft monies"
into United States dollars will solve the problem. That, honourable senators, is of course
not within our control, and we cannot do a
single thing about it.

I wish to call your attention to an article
that appeared in the Februory 14 issue of the
publication I quoted from previously, the
London Economist. This is less than a month
ago. I do net entirely agree with the article,
but it comes from a most responsible quarter.
Here it is:
Britain faces bankruptcy. That is the real
significance of the government's latest White
Paper. At last, the British people now know
where they stand. In the past two years, they
have -as a community overspent their income
to the extent of £1,000 million and the rate of
overspending was almost twice as large in 1947
as in the preceding year. At the present rate
of expenditure (which has fallen since its peak
last August but now shows signs of settling
down at a monthly figure of some £40 million),
the remaining reserves of about £600 million
in gold, dollars and unexhausted credits may
last Britain and the sterling aiea until midStimumer.
I doubt if it will.
The article continues:
After that. it will just be impossible to buy
either the food or the raw materials which are
necessary) for Britain te eat and w ork. The
spectre of starvation andi mass unempîoymen.t
is now alarmingly close.
To tr.anslate the tables and figures of the
White Paper into more homely terms, Britain
has been living like an improvident family
which, failing te make both ends meet, first
spiends the accumulated capital of the past,
then borrows frion friends-froua Aimerican
frienos. Canadian friends, from South African
friends-and when their loans are exhausted,
begins to pawn the furniture.

Now honourable senators, those words are net
lightly written. They are not my words or
those of any Canadian; they are the words of
a distinguislhed authority on economies. I
think.the picture that is painted is altogether
too black, but it is net too black to be faced
scriously.
The other day I noticed that Lord Beaverbrook had said that he had confidence in
Britain and the British people. We all have.
We are very proud of the record of the British
people. They can work out their problems if
anybody can. We know that the Marshall
Plan will help to a certain extent, and we all
hope and believe that there will be an ultimate rehabilitation of Europe; but, honourable senators, that will net solve the problem
of the dollar shortage.
The suggestion bas been made that we
should shift our import market and buy where
we sell. Well, we have had the British preference, which was some help te us, but it has
never solved the problem. We have had the
additional preference of sentiment, of family
tics and our position in the Empire. But that
has not solived the problem. The trouble is
that we in Canada, because of our proximity
to the United States, have struggled all our

MARCU 9,1948
life against nature and geography. If we cannot solve the diffioul.ty by effectively changing our import market, then the only other
market to change is the export market. I
should flot use the word "change", hecause
nobody here vçants to change our financial
or trade relations with the United States
or the United Kingdom. But we could
change them in. one sense, by adding to our
trade with the United States such an amount
as would overcome this deficit which, by reason of the abundance of our trade, is bringing
us to ruin.
How are we going to> bring about this
change? We have had some discussion on the
Geneva agreemnents and their relationship to
this problem. But, because they will be discussedi more f-u]ly later, it is n-ot proper for
me to deal with them now.
As I see it, honourable senators, there are
two things that we should look forward to. I
can.not discuss them in detail now, because I
have already taken. too long. One suggestion
that bas been, made is that there sbould be
new reciprocal arrangements, flot, with the
wbole worlcl, but with the United States. I
remember that we tried that hack in 1911. If
honourable senators will permit me, I should
like to reminisce for a moment. I remember
when, Sir Robert Borden made his keynote
speech in Halifax tbirty-seven years aga. I
arn sorry that His Hon-our the Speaker is not
i the Chair, because in the 1911 election I
went up to Nelson when he was a candidate
for the constîtuency of Kootenay. It covered
a tremnendous area. There are now two constituencies where formerly there was one.
I spoke for Dr. Kling, as he ws.s then known,
who was running as a Liberal candidate
supporting reciprocity. Sir Robert Borden
in his keynote speech said, "Here are ten
million people competîng with 110 million
people. It cannot be done." I arn sure
honourable senators wilI' not object to nmy
relating my youthful endeavours to answer
that statement. I made use of this illustration. I said: "That is, roughly speaking, ten
to one. Let us say, then, there are ten men
and one man. Then let us suppose that a
Canadian wants to buy a straw hat, and that
there are ten' Americans with straw hats to
seli. Who has the advantage, the Canadian
or tbe Americans? Or let us reverse the situation and say that one Can-adian has a straw
bat to sel' and, ten bald-headied. Americans
wan.t ta buy a hat. Who then has the adwvantage, the Americans or the Canadian?"
Hon. Mr. HAIG: May I ask my honourable
friend wbat effeet that story had on, tbe
election?
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: The tragedy is that it
had no effeet.

211

Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. EULER: But Dr. King was
elected.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: What I arn suggesting
to honourable sens tors is that bindssight is
better than foresighit; that we should take
advantage of the hindsight, gain-ed from that
situation and make it foresight for the present
one.
It is suggested, that there, is great danger
connected with these trade arrangements with
the United, States; that after we get our
factories set up andi the business going n'icely
there will be a change of governinent over
there and. these arrangements will be witbdrawn and we will be left stranded. I have
two or three answers to that suggestion. In
the first place, I do not think that fearlooking around the corner for the bogy'-manis the basis on, which this en'terprîsing country
should carry on its trade relations. I think
that if we bad concerned ourselveg, flot witb
prophecy but with wbat would have bappened,
that reciprocity treaty between Canada and
the United States would have brought us such
an era of prosperity that we could stand on
our own' feet regardless of any temporary
setback.
In dealing with reciprocity agreements I
would point out that they eut both ways. If
we are able to build up a substantial industry
in this coun'try by trading witb the United
States, it means we have satisfied customers
over there who buy our goods; and the more
that situation develops and grows, the less
likely the Americans are to want to make a
change of policy for political reasons. Honourable senators, let us face realities. It is better
to export goods to the United States than
to export hrains.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: That is one of the sad
and serious facts that confronte us in this
country at the present time. The only way
to resist the dominating influence of the
United States is to be strong. We are talking now of physical things. The only way te
be strong in that sense is to make trade
prosperous. So much for the agreements.
Now I arn going to suggest sorte thîngs
which we can do at home to bring i American
dollars. One is to develop the tourist trade.
We have an unlimited market, an unlimited
product, and goods of unrivalled quality. We,
a handful of people spread over haîf a continent, can offer every tourist inducement to
the 140 million people at our doors. They
are the best spenders in the world, and there
are no other people they like as well as
Canadians. I have said that we possess every

SENATE

inducement. That is not correct. There are
soine poerful inducements which we oughit
to attend to, and very quickly. First among
th-care our automobile highways. I suggest to honourable members, flot without diffidcnce. but wjth a real confidence. tuit a
trans-Canada highway of 'the kind which
Americans xviii find as easy to travel on as
their own, and excelling their own in scenic
attraction, untier climatie conditions which for
a part of the year are far better than theirs,
is a work-to quote from the British North
America Act-"-ýfor the general advantage of
Canýida.'.
1 believe that ne constructive
eicuavour xvbteb this country cen make, witheut a drain upen our resources, would bring in
more Amnerican dollars than the construction
of that kind of a highway, coupled with provincial and international feeders, se that at
strategic points in every province there wouid
be highways whichi of thcmseives xvould invite
the United States tourist.
The cost? Weil, I did some figuring todayI arn pretty geod eat figuring xvhen there is
nebodv te chee-k mne-and 1 estimate tbat the
very outside cedt of previding ourseix es xvitli
a ceai highway would lie $i250 million. If 1
had mcntioned that figure in the (ICys whcn
we used to talîr in millions, 1 weuld bave been
lauighed oiit of court. But today xve have
outgrewn millions; we think oniv in billions.
We bave leaned billions te Great Britain: 1
dlo net recaîl the exact figures. Three or four
y.rars ago I hiad tbe opportunity of making
a speech on a boan of a billion dollars in
asets te Britain. 1 do net criticize that boan;
1 beliex e it, was a geod thing. Very recently
we leened anether billion dollars te Great
Britain. Those boans were net founded solely
on sentiment; we justified them te orir peeple
on tie ground that eut of the credit created
by flie lans we were going te do business.
At the price of elle-quiarter'of ene of those

the fear that if these men have the right to

We hear a lot about social security, and we
bonst a good deal about our advances in that
field. Ail of us are proud of it. But in the
last analysis social security depends on financial security, and financial security is flot the
outcome of 'isrns or ideologies, or any socialistic policy of "dividing the wealth". Wherever
that sort of thing i.s tried it cnds, flot in dividing the wealth, but in dividing poverty. If
private motive and incentive for competition
are destroyed, what happens? Everyone knows
that without incentive and the spirit of coinpetition there can he no progress and advancement in the world. The lessons taught by the
Socialist governrnent in the United Kingdom
at the prEsent time 'bring this point home.* Its
goverirment has too long concerned itself withi
shibboleths and ideologies. But today Sir
Stefford Cripps and the newspapers are telling
the people that Great Britain is facing actual
disaster. Sir Stafford Cripps has not told his
people bie is going to solve the problern by
more socialisrn; within the last week hie has
told thema that they will starve unless they
produce and export more goods. H1e has said
that the only way this can be done is by
work and more work, and by co-operation and
efficiency. That is the position in Great
Britain. Our position is not comparable with
theirs in our forrn of governent, nor is it
comparable in other ways. The word "austerity" is a misnomer when au plied to any legislation in this country. I arn glad to see that
the government does flot use it. There i,
no reason for austerity in this country, but I
arn sure-and I think rny honourable friend
who is srni]ing at me (Hon. Mr. Duif) will
agrce-there is reason for apprehiension. There
is a danger that our people, looking too much
for what the governrnent can do for them, will
lose the sterling qualities of self-discipline and
seîf-reliance which made our fathers great in
the pnst and helped thern to create for us a
glorious heritage. We must face these issues
-lot only our international problems but
also our domestic problems--with the fim
resolve to carry on thc torch of liberty and
the torch of free enterprise and industrial
freedom, so that sornewhere out of the darkness will corne the light of a new prosperity.
Some Hon. SENATORS: ilear, hear.
On the motion of Hon. Mr. Haig the debate
was adjourned.

FARM

IMPROVEMENT
SECOND

LOANS

BILL

READING

Hon. WISHART MeL. ROBERTSON
rnoved the second reading of Bill 114, an Act
to amend the Farrn Improvement Loans Act,
1944.
H1e said: Honourable senators, the main purpose of this bill is to cxtend the present Farm
Improvement Loans Act for a further period
of three years, on the samne basis as the present
Act. These boans are the result of legislation
that was passed to make it possible for farmers
to securo at a reasonable rate of interest boans
of a more or less temporary nature, which
otherwise might not have been available to
them. The boans are made by the chartered
banks, which are guaranteed against loss up
to 10 per cent of the aggregate principal
amount loaned by each haok. In the past the
average farmer bas not always been able to
get hank credit for irnproving or developing
his farm. Ijnder this Act he could borrow
amounts up to $3,000 for periods up to ten
years, at 5 per cent simple interest. The
liability of the government was limited to an
aggregate principal arnount of $250 million in
boans made by nîl banks over a three-year
period. I think this was largely due to the
fact that there was a period of relative prosperity on the part of the farming community,
and the opportunity was not taken advantage
of to as great an, extent ns might have been
expected.
Between March 1, 1945, when the Act
became operative, and December 31, 1947,
39,387 boans have been made, to a total value
of $31,423,129.23. Haîf of that total amount
bas already been repaid. The director advises
me that in the flrst three years of operation,
which terminated at the end of February,
there have been no cases of default, wbieh
required repayrnt by the governrnent to the
banks. I think the traditional bonesty, willingness and thrift Gf the agricultural community
and the general conditions of prosperity which
have existed, account for this excellent record
and the slight extent to which boans have
been availed of.
The effeet of the flrst arndment will be to
close off the old pool of boans at the end of
February and to extend the power for a
fitirtber period of three years. It is calculated
that by that time, the total amounit of loans,
on the original face value, wilb be $35 millions.
Therefore, the total outstanding liabibity whîch
will be carried over to the next tbree-year
period will be the difference between the
original $250 million and the $35 million loaned
in the past three years. The Minister of
Finance will pay the banks for ail losses

SENATE

incurred on these loans provided they do flot
exceed 10 per cent of the total eligible loans
made by the bank.
Honourable senators, 1 repeat that the
liability of the government is lirnited to 10
per cent of the aggregate luans that were made
from time to time; and as I have already
indicated, up to the presenit time there have
been no cases of defaulýt. This will leave a
pool of approximately $215 million which
may be loaned under the act during the next
three years, under the same guarantee as in
the past.
The second amendment made by this bill
extends the type of security which may be
taken. It enables the banks to take a mortgage on the construction, repair alteration of
or addition to any farm building or structure.
Heretofore, the bank could take this type
of security only when the boan principal
exceeded $2,000, and was for more than a fiveyear period.
Apparently it bas been the
practice, if any specifie security was given, to
take it in the forma of farmn implements or
equipment of that type.
The amcndment
makes it possible for farmers who, for one
reason or another, cannot give farma impIement security, to obtain boans on mortgage

security. This w~ill enable many farmers to
take adv antag-e of the act who forrncrly were
excluded because they did not own much in
the way of farm implements.
This is largely an extension existing legislatien for the next three years. If any honourable senators xvould like to have further
information than I have been able to give, I
shall be glad to move that the bill be referred
to the Banking and Commerce Coînmittee,
which wvill be meeting tomorrow morning, and
I shaîl undertake te see that the appropriate
offlcials are present to answer questions.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I certainly have no objection to the bill, nor do I think it should go ýto
committee. I know it is out of order for me
to refer to what was said on another bill,
but perbaps I may be allowed to remind the
bouse that the honourable gentleman fromn
Vancouver South (Hon. Mr. Farris) suggested
this afternoon an expenditure of $250 million
on roads. Well, I do not think we should
objeet te spending $250 million on behaîf of
the farmers of Canada.

EMERGENCY EXCHANGE
CONSERVATION BILL
SECOND

READING

The Senate resumed from yesterday the
adjourned debate on the motion of Hon. Mr.
Farris for the second reading of Bill 3, an Act
respecting Emergency Measures for the
Conservation of Canadian Foreign Exchange
Resources.
Hon. JOHN T. HAIG: By way of aside,
I may say that I have aiways been used to
addressing the Speaker, and it is hard for me
to get out of the -habit of directing my
remarks to hum. So if occasionally I turn away
from you, honourable senators, it is because
old habits get the best of me, flot that I wish
to ignore you.
The causes of this bill were inevîtabie.
During the war we in Canada had done a
great deal of manufacturing, of spending, of
selling; we had made large gifts to the world,
thereby piling up a great load of debt. Folhowing the war we were influenced by a queer
mentality; it was very hard, not onIy for the
government but for ail -of us, to overcome the
habits that we had fallen into. Hnwever, by
the beginning of 1946 we were back on our
own, and some of us on this side of the house
ventured to suggest that we were going too
fast, that we were spending beyond our
capacity. I well remember that at that time
certain honourabie senators now within the
sound of my voice reproached me for being
a pessimist; they told me that I was talking
nonsense, that there was no ground for these
warnings, that the world was ail right, Canada
was going along fine, and that prosperity would
hast forever, or certainhy as long as the present
governinent remained in power.
Hon. Mr. HOWARD: Hear, hear.

SENATE

Hon. Mr. HAIG- What happened? By July
1946 our noney was so depreciated in relation
to the American dollar that we had to pay
$1.11 for a United States dollar, and Arnerican
money could be exchanged here at the rate of
$1.10 per Canadian dollar. In a moment I
shall revert to that matter.
It has long been a puzzle to me how
honourable gentlemen opposite, who belong to
he Liberal party, can take any pleasure in
such a measure as Bill No. 3. One can understand that, were a dyed-in-the-wool old-Tory
government in power, it might try to put
through a bill like this; but it is a mystery to
me how such a measure can be acceptable to
Liberals, led by such men as my honourable
friend from the Maritime provinces (Hon. Mr.
Robertson), the senator from Churchill (Hon.
Mr. Crerar), the junior member from Vancouver (Hon. Mr. Mackenzie) and the member
from Queen's-Lunenburg (Hon. Mr. Kinley).
I say nothing about the members from
Quebec and Ontario; but what is the explanation of the attitude of the honourable senators
I have referred to? Ever since J have been
connected with polities these gentlemen have
told us that the Liberal party stands for freedom of trade. Yet since confederation there
has never been a measure more adverse to
free trade than the present bill. It provides
for a 25 per cent excise duty on imported
goods; it absolutely prohibits the importation
of certain goods and place-s still others under
quotas, and it provides that certain classes
may only be iiportcd bY petmision of the
Minister of Tran-port. I am not to be understood in this connection as attacking the miniister; probalyhv. Nere I in his place, I would
<lo as lie does; but il is astonishing to find a
Libri ail gover nient promoting legislation
under whieb goods may be brought in only
by hc, g--ac of God and the signature of the
minister.
If the lat
Sir Wilfrid Laurier
knows what is going on in this country, I can
well believe that he must turn over in his
last resting place and say, "Surely these are
not the people whom I left in control of the
affairs of Canada when I pa-sed on."
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Do you not admit
that self-prcservation is tlie first law of nature?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I thought thiat only
applied to the Tory part.
Sonie Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I did not know that it
also appltd o the Liberal party. I am very
glad to leacn that it does.
Honourable senators. if there ever was a
trave tv of Liberalisn, this bill is the absolute
acme of it.

I apologize to the member from Waterloo
(lion. Mr. Euler) foc not mentioning him
when I was picking ont those whose support of
the bill I cannot utnderstand.
lion. Mr. EITLER: Was my honourable
fiend (Hon. Mr. Haig) thinking of oleomargarine?
lion. Mr. HAIG: I am a Tory and would
not be expected to think of it. I could understand my honourable friends on this side from
Quebe-, Ontario, and the Maritime Province
doing that kind of thing, but I honestly cannot
quite uinderstand my friend from Waterloo
doing it.
Hon. Mr. EULER: May I ask the honourable senator a question? What, exactly, is
he accusing the member from Waterloo of
doing?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Of supporting a measure
which is the most hostile to freedom that I
have ever heard of.
Hon. Mr. EULER: I have not donc so yet.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I am glad to hear that;
I still have some hope then. However, I wish
to warn my friend that lie will be on record
when the motion for second reading is put.
lion. Mr. EULER: You are on record on
other matters.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Yes, but this is a matter of
government policy.
It is now my purpose to give some of the
causes of the present situation. The honourable member for Vancouver South (Hon. Mr.
Farris) made a very able speech yesterday,
but I do net agree with some of the points
lie put forward, nor do I think ho shouîld have
raised others, because in my opinion they
added nothing to the debate. However, I
heartily agrce with his statement that unless
Canada produces more goods there will not
be much hope of this or any other legislation
pulling Canada out of its difficulties.
I should now like to point out two or three
things that the government has done. In
July 1916-it may have been June 1946; I shall
stand corrected if I am wrong-the government put the Canadian dollar back at par.
The honourable member from Vancouver
South read what the Minister of Finance said
in another place to defend that action. Regardless of what the Minister of Finance says, I
do not believe the Canadian people feel that
what was done should have been done.
If our money was still at a 10 per cent
discount, or there was a 10 per cent premium
on American money, I believe the Americans
would come over Pere as tourists and spend

MARCH 10, 1948

their money on Canladian goods. They are
selfish, like the rest of us, and if they sec a
chance to make a 10 per cent profit, they will
take advantage of it. Let me illustrate this
point. In August 1946 a Canadian farmer
wanted to buy approximately a tbousand acres
of land owned by an American. The American
offered to scîl for $27,000 in American money.
Tbe farmer came to me and said, "What shal
I do?" I told him to go to the bank and get
American funds. He got the 327,000. But
the land was worth $30,000 in Canadian funds.
That is wbat happens. If our money had been
at par with the American dollar that money
n'ou]d neyer have gone to the United States.
What happened to alI the commodities we
sold? We could put up the price on pulpwood,
and the Amer;cans would still buy it; -but we
cannot increase the price of gold, because the
Americans pay only $35 an ounce for it.
Putting our dollar back on a par with the
American dollar was the first mistake the
goveroment made, regardless of what the
minister seid, and I venture to say that in
their inner hearts the government of this country have regretted that move more than any
other that bas been made in the last ten years.
Now, what bas happened? My honourable
friend said that in 1947 we had the greatest
trade that this country lias ever known, and
yet, so far as American exehange is concernied,
that we were in a state of bankruptcy-I use
my own word for it, rather than his-or at
least that we would run into bankruptcy if we
kept on in the samne way. Well, some of us
on this side of the bouse, ineluding myscîf,
warned that we would mun into some sucb dificulty if we continued to sell to Europe on
credit, as we were doing. In fact, we were not
even selling on credit, but were making gifts to
Europe, and I am not objecting to that. But
it was clear to me, as it must have been to
every member of this house, where that
system was bound to lead us, because among
the goods we sold in the non-American
market-a.side from natural products-there
were sure to be somne that we could have
sold in the United States, and to that extent
aur American dollars were reduced.
I have neyer been able to find out fromn the
government-and here I crit-icize the Minister
of Finance and bis officials--why the people
of Canada should not know how m-ucb we
have got in the forma of United States dollars
and gold. Why should that knowledge have
been kept secret fromn members of parliament
ever since 1946? We were given little dribs
of information. The honourable gentleman
quoted yesterday somte figures presented
before our Banking and Commerce Committee
in 1946 by Mr. Graham Towers, but they were
5853-16J

217

general figures that did not enlighten us in
any detail as to hon' our money n'as running
out. The late Senator McGeer challenged
those figures several times in this bouse, but
hie was flot able to get any further information. Today we stili have only general hints
as to what our position is. Why cannot the
people of Canada be trusted in this matter?
I should like to know how much we lost in
gold and 11.S. currency between January 1,
1946 and the time wben our dollar was
placed on a par with the United States dollar.
I venture to suggest that our losses grew twie
as fast after the 10 per cent discount on our
money n'as discontinued. That is to- say, I
suggest that from the lst of January to the
end of June 1946 our loss of United States
eurrency and gold was very smalt, but that
as soon as our money was placed at par the
losses incre'ased at double the former rate,
and so continued for the next six months.
Furtber, 1 will suggest that during 1947 the
loss n'as five times as great. 1 challenge any
member to get the figures from the government-though I doulit if anyone can get themn
-and see if my statement is not correct.
That situation was bound to develop. To
realize that, you only needed, to be present in
our Banking and Commerce Committee in
August 1946, when Mr. Grabam Towers-a very
able and efficient servant of this country~
expressed the opinion that our surplus might
be decreased by $600 million in one year. As
we now know, the decrease was a good deal
more than tbat. Our loss was worse than
indi'cated by the figures which the honou-rable
gentleman gave us yesterday, because they did
not include the United States currency that we
got from Great Britain and other countries in
1946 and 1947, whicb was considerable. In
other words, our loss of American currency
during the eleven montbs of 1947 n'as not
$750 miallion, but probably close to $1 billion.
I camne now to my chief point of criticism
against this government. For some time there
bias been sitting in another place a commuittee
investigating the prices of variou6 articles of
food, ineluding bread. Some companies selI a
loaf at ten cents, and others sell it at 13 cents.
I am flot sure just what the weight of the
loaf is.
Hon. Mr. CAMPBELL: Twenty-four ounce&.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Anybody who cornes from
Manitoba, Saskatchewan or Alberta knows
that we are selling the wheat that goes into the
making of flour for that bread at 31.55 a bushel.
The riglit price is twice that, and therefore the
price of bread should be higher. But we have
refused to allow our farmiers to sell their
produets in tbe highest market, and a similar

SENATE

restriction has been placed upon our lumberinen and our fishermen. Right now the Geneva
agreements permit the sale of 800,000 Canadian
cattle annually in the United States; but the
government will not allow us to send cattle
there.
Hon. Mr. ROBINSON: The figure under
the Geneva agreements is 400,000.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I thought it was 800,000.
Hon. Mr. JOHNSTON: No, it is 400,000.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: All riglit. But the government will not Jet us ship them. Why? The
roico giv n is that if we sold that number of
cattle to the United States we could not carry
out our agreement with the British government.
But why should the rancher and the farmer
have to pay the sliot? We could get badly
needed American dollars by selling cattle in
the United States; yet we are not allowed, to
do so. Furthermore. why should we not sell
all our other products on the American market
if we wish to? For the last three or four years
the price of oats and barley across the international line has been much higher than in
Canada. I think that was true of flax also until
this year, when the price was guaranteed by
the government. Manitoba produced last year
200,000 bushels of flax more than was produced
in all the rest of Canada. You can figure what
our production was when I say that the total
production in Canada was five and a half
million bushels.'
Now why should the government protest
that we have a shortage of American exchange
when they refuse to let us sell our commodities on the American market, where we could
get higher prices than we are able to get in
Canada? I have read the reports of debates
in another place, and I have been unable to
find any answer to that question. In the newspapers I have seen it stated that if we were
allowed to sell in the United States our
naturel products of the farm, the forest, the
mine and the sea, the higlier prices paid for
those products would result in an increase in
the cost of living in Canada and lead, to further inflation. Well, why should the farmers
and our other primary producers protect the
rest of us fron inflation?
Hon. A. L. BEAUBIEN: My honourable
friend knows that American rve was sold in
western Canada.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Yes, a very small quantity. But we have not been allowed to sell
our oats, barley and wheat across the line.
We could get $3.30 a bushel in American funds
for our wheat on the United States market.
Hon. Mr. CAMPBELL:
duty be?

What would the

Hon. Mr. HAIG: It is 42 cents a bushel, so
there would still be a net of about $2.85,
instead of the $1.55 which our farmers are
getting now for the largest part of their crop.
Last year the crop in western Canada was
about 330 million bushels. Of that amount,
about 160 million bushels will go to Great
Britain at $1.55, and 100 million will be used
for food, seeding and other purposes in
Canada. That leaves 60 or 70 million bushels
thîat we could sell abroad at $3.30 a bushel.
Hon. Mr. JOHNSTON: My honourable
friend knows that $1.55 is not all that the
western producer will get for bis wheat.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Yes, but that is all he gets
for 160 million bushels sold to Britain and 100
million bushels sold in Canada. The surplus
of 60 million bushels could be sold abroad for
$3.30 a bushel. I challenge my friend to contradict that statement.
There are three fundamental causes which
drove us into our present predicament. First,
we lent or sold too much of our goods on
credit and used United States currency to buy
part of the ingredients that went into those
goods. Second, we cut down the flow of
American money coming into Canada by way
of the tourist trade or investments in this
country.
Third, we refused to allow our
natural products to flow to the American
markets.
I am as much opposed as the honourable
inember from Vancouver South (Hon. Mr.
Farris) to making a deal with the Americans.
My memory goes back quite a distance, and
I have read in history of the ten-year period
when we had a reciprocity agreement with the
United States government. During that time
Canada, for the most part-Ontario, Quebec
and the maritime provinces-was very prosperous. Then the agreement was done away
with, and for quite a while we were in the
dumps. That situation was really what brought
about confederation.
I was one of those
opposed to the reciprocity agreement in 1911,
and a great many of my friends throughout
Canada took the same stand. Nevertheless,
it must be said that when we sell on the open
market we are not bound by any restrictions
at all; we can sell our goods in the United
States if we like.
Now may I say a word or two about the
cure for our troubles? I listened yesterday to
the speech of my honourable friend from Vancouver South, and I must say candidly that
he is a very able lawyer. He talked very
little about the bill and a great deal about
building roads across Canada, doing away with
strikes, and having everybody work hard and
produce more goods. I must admit that his

MARCH 10, 1948
tactics were good. I admire his strategy, and
would like ta be as skilful myseif. But
throughout his speech I heard nothing of how
we could get out of our present troubles.
1 arn convinced by the argument presented
by the honourabie member from TorontoTrinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck), and I acknowiedge his contribution towards the solution of
our difficuities. He said that the worid muet
corne to the point where, currencies have the
sarne freedorn to find their own leveis of value
that other things bave. Honourable senators
rnay ask what about the International Monetary Fund? Weli, France deait witb that
organization. She hit it right between the
eyes, and there was no kickback; in fact, the
bank is going ail out to heip France as rnucb
as it can, and it would do the sarne for uis.
That is my first point-that we sbouid let
currency find its own level of exchange.
I agree entireiy with wbat rny honourabie
friend frorn Vancouver South said about controis. One can justify any contrai ha, likes,
provided he gets to the people who benefit by
it. Wby, I can justify rent control any time,
because there are a thousand renters to one
owner. I can justify contrai of butter, because
there are ten thousand cansurners ta one
producer.
Hon. Mr. EULER. You are making rny
argument.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: If a country is ta go any
place it mnust have freedorn frorn contrais.
Today, Great Britain bas the acrne af cantrol.
That situation bas been brought about by the
socialists tbere, and the socialise in Canada
are saying, "Give us cantrols and we wilI save
this country; we wili plan it for you." WeIl,
they have a pianned econorny in England and,
as my honourabie friend said yesterday, Sir
Stafford Cripps is a czar; his word is iaw. Do
we want a sirnilar situation in Canada? I do
nat think so.
1 amrn ot too cioseiy cornparing aur situation with that of Great Britain, because I
realize what that country bas gone tbrough.
I know that she bas exhausted her foreign
investments and bas loat ber sbipping. I know
aiso that sbe bas stood between us and tyranny,
and I as a Canadian arn oniy tao wiiiing to,
beip ber. I agree witb the bonourabie senatar
frorn Kennebec (Hon. Mr. Vaiiiancourt) wben
be refers ta the great mnarket aver there; but
tbe fact remains tbat the phiiasopby of this
country is very much one of freedorn.
I sbould like ta give an illustration af wbat
a certain ciass of workrnan is doing today, and
I arn sorry that my bonauTabie friend frorn
Biaine Lak~e (Hon. Mr. Horner) is flot in bis
place to. bear it. Two brothers in Ontario, by

cutting and bauiing puipwoad ta the market,
in the past four rnontbs, eacb earned $2,500 net,
ai ter deducting incarne tax. Then they said,
"Tbat is enough for us, we are going borne."
But that is not good enough for this country;
that is the wrong tbing ta do. I say that if
tbose men have tbe abiiity ta make that much
rnoney in so short a tirne, we sbould let tbern
make mare. Our systern of incarne tax is striking at and curtaiiing the productive abiiity af
aur people. Tbat situation bas ta, be rernedied.
I agree with rny bonourabie friend frorn
Vancouver Soutb (Hon. Mr. Farris) that we
rnust tell the ordinary producers in tbis country-with the sarne good will witb wbicb we
wouid advise tbe boys and girls ini aur bousebold-tbat there is no royal road ta weaith;
that tbe only way ta succeed is by bard work
and production. If we accept Bible history as
true, we muet believe what was toid. ta those
wbo were turned out af the Garden af Eden,
that man muet earn bis bread by the sweat of
bis brow. I believe that anyane in any cauntry who operates on any other basis wiii end
in disaster.
Tbere is no use teliing men that tbey mnuet
work only forty bours per week. Wîthin aur
national economy they bave ta produce suffidient volurne to justify what they receive i
return for that forty bours work. That le the
crux of the wbaie probiern. If my farmer
friends frorn St. Jean Baptiste (Hon. Mr.
Beaubien), Central Saskatchewan (Hon. Mr.
Johnston) and Blaine Lake (Hon. Mr. Horner),
have ta work seventy hours a week ta earn
as rnucb as a man in sorne otber ernployrnent
earns in forty hours, the economy of aur
country oannat stand up against sucb discrimination. That is the reason for the
number af people who are unernpioyed taday.
I arn toid there are 20,000 unempioyed in
Vancouver, 20,000 in Winnipeg, at least 10,000
in Montreai and 4,000 in Halifax. Yet, in
spite of all that unernpioyment, new people
are coming into this country because our own
people bave adopted tbe pbiiosapby that a
man or a woman in this country is expected ta
work only forty bours a week in order ta,
enjoy the sarne standard af living as the rnan
wba works seventy hours. Durmng the past
five or six years, wben s0 rnany men were out
an strike, tbe gavernment was at fauit ini failing ta tell tbern that ta bave their share of the
incarne of this countrY, tbey mnust produce ta
the value of that incarne.
I ask bonourable senatars why the boys,
especîaliy i rny province, are ieaving the
farrns to go ta the cities? I believe the reason
is that tbere is a chance for easier living i
the cities. These bays do not take into consideratian the 20,000 unemployed ini Van-

SENATE

couver and the sarne number in Winnipeg;
they only consider those who are employed.
One who cornes frorn a srnall village, as I
did, knows that the village people point only
to, those who Ieft the village, went to the city,
and did well; they forget about those who
migrated to the city and almost starved to
death.
Our whole philoscphy with respect to wages
and labour has to, change. No country (an
succecd witbout the labouring mnan. and ne
one ivants lîim to get less than.the feul value
No rity cau succeed xith

only businessýmen in ht it must, hiave the
cornîon people. At the samne time people
sbould learn that only by liard work and
attention to duty can one get on in the world.
During the last four or five years the government bas been too lax in dealing with
problems of labour. Labour leaders-I do flot
ref or to the ýrank and flle-sbould be tolýd that
the national eoonomy produces se much in a
year, and that labour is entitlcýd to its share,
but no more than its liare. Wc hear coinplaints about profits. But profits account for
onlv a very small part of the total turn-over.
Take the case cf neit: a st rikc last faîl
inci-cased tlic costs, and up wvent priers. J; is
said that profits increaseil. When thie packers
go; more for the saine quantilv of produots,
naturally there arc morc pr;ofits.
I aiie ýsure that conditions will nlot be

Lot mie give an illustration cf bow restriction operies. Iu doing se I cast ne reflection
upon the Minister of Finance, xhom-to
speak candidly I like personally, and who
I believe is sweeping aside red tape, and trying to do a good job. A Manitoba business
maan wvanted te import goods of the value of
$650 in connectien witb a contract whiýjb was
wortb $20,000 to a Canadian firrn. The officiaIs
at Winnipeg would flot permit the goods te be
brougbt in. Luckily, our Minister of Finance
is net witbout brains; ho ruled that they
sbould corne in, and the Winnipeg cornpany
got :the $20060 contriwt. This is but the sort
of case-they may run into the hundredswh'ich will be affected by these regulations.
For these reasons, liono-urable senaters, I do
net bolieve that this bill will do any good.
It may conserve a littie meney, but the situatien dernands more drastie rernedies. The
governent will bave te reverse its stand on

the exclhange question. It will bave te encourage the selling of our produets in the United
States or any other country which has the
bard currency te buy tbern. It will have to
tell our producers, espocially in the cities and
larger towns. "Payrnent for your production
will be propýortioued te your contribution te
production as a whoie."
If these three principies are put inte effect,
our country will corne back te conditions of
prosperity. Probably it will cerne back anyway, but a lot cf tirne -and rnoney will be

of legislation and regulations which ordinarily would considerably shock persons who
had any Liberal views. But necessity, which
makes strange bedfellows, also makes for
bard, unusual and disagreeable laws and regulations. So we have this bill. I for one arn not
happy about it, yet I think we must accept it
as necessary under the circurnstances witb
whicb we are threatened. Our position is rnuch
the same as that of a man who, having lived
for years on an annual income of $10,000 and
acquired certain standards and ways of living,
suddenly findeB bis incorne reduced by 40 or
50 per cent. Whetber he wants to or not,
whether he is happy about it or whetber he
finds it disagreeable, he is cornpelled to, adjust
his way of living to bis more limited meane.
Tbis is analogous to tbe position whicb confronts us with relation to available sources
andc supplies of United States dollars, and
bowever we feel about it we have to rnake
the best of it and spend witbin our means.
The bill is intended to set up a kind of
planned economy. To that principle we
Liberals have been opposed, and I believe our
views on this matter are sbared by the bonourable senator opposite who bas .iust spoken.
We dislike the limitations and restrictions
whicb are involved in a planned economy.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I apologize to MY honourable frjend if I did not make it clear tbat those
are rny views.
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: Our only grounds for
hopefulness are, first, that the measuýre wil
be admînistered by those wbo have the real
Liberal viewpoint; and, second, that it is to
be no more than a temporary expedient. We
would not be prepared to subseribe to a measure of this kind if we believed that it would
be in operation, for all tirne to corne. We
accept it as a means of dealing witb the situation wbich exists at the moment. Everywbere
in the world there is disorder. Nowbere else
are conditions such as to give any assurance
that we can move forward in the freedorn we
knew before, the war. Faced, therefore, witb
these difficulties, harassed with so rnany uncertainties, we -must advance with caution and
proteet ourselves on all sides. That is the purpose of this bill. It contains three sehedules,
descrîbing various types of goods which rnay
be subjeet eitber to prohibition, to quota or to
permits. But the bill also provides that in
the discretion of the minister, and by regulation, gonds may pass frorn Seheduýle I to Sehe,dule H, and from Sehedule II to Sehedule III,
and goods not in the sebedules may be substituted for goods which are at present in the
scheduhes. So there is absolute. free and unfet-

tered power in the administration to deal witb
the economic situation from time to time as
conditions may require.
There are one or two things in this bill to
whieh I should direct attention. The first is
that the bill cornes into force by proclamation.
We are aetually operating under it at the
present time, and I think, therefore, that we
shahl have to determine in committee whether
it is necessary to give retroactive effect to the
bill in order to legalize what has gone on. This
bill also expires on proclamation, and an far
as this chamber is concerned, 1 do not think
it is a very satisfactory way of leaving any
legishation. Parliament as well as this chamber
sbould be lef t with sorne measure of control,
and should -know that at eorne date there wilh
be an opportunity to review the measure.
There should be an end to the road for this
legisiation, a tirne wben we can consider and
weigh ail that bas been donc and decide
whether it is necessary to continue it. I
regard this as an important point in the
consideration of this bill by the senate.
There are one or two other matters I wish
to discuss before I sit down. I mnust offer my
congratulations to the bonourable senator from
Vancouver South (Hon. Mr. Farris), who
explained this bill yesterday. I do not mind
repeating publîchy what I told birn yesterday.
I sirnply said that every time be speaks my
admiration of *whnt he says and the manner
in which he says it grows more and more.
I was a little amused today at rny bonourable friend, the leader of the opposition (Hon.
Mr. Haig) when be referred to sorne of the
propounded
so-ealled 2olutions that 'were
yesterday. One solution had to do with a
Trans-Canada bighway. Knowing the great
love my bonourable friend has for his native
city of Winnipeg, I could flot help wondering
whether his criticism did not stemn from the
fact that yesterday's speech advocated a
Trans-Canada higbway instead of a systern
of roads leading frorn ail directions to the city
of Winnipeg.
Sorne Hon. SENATORS:

Oh, oh.

Hon. Mr. HA.YDEN: I cannot agree with
the suggestion that the depreciation of Canadian currency is the solution of this problem,
and that if we bad not restored ýour dollar
parity ini July 1946 we would flot be faced with
the present situation. I must qualify my
remarks by saying that the restoration of our
dollar parity in Juhy 1946 did a tremendous
amount of damage to the gnld mining industry
in Canada, and I realize that to date there

222

SENATE

222

SENATE

has not been sufficient correction of this situation. However, having regard to ail the consequences of the action taken, I think the course
followed by the government was perfectly justified. Yet I must say that the world-wide situation being what it is, with other cointries
entering into the field of currency depreciation as a method of pushing themselves forward and extending their export trade, we
may shortly find ourselves in the position of
having to depreciate our currency in order
to maintain some kind of equilibrium with
other countries of the world.
This is not a question about which we can
be doctrinal or dogmatie, or about which we
can say that it is the right or wrong thing to
do, because we may have to review and
revise our recommendations. laving regard to
the picture which is changing every minute
and every hour of the day, we have got to
be in a position to adjust our sights and revise
our determinations according to the best
interests of Canada. I am not prepared to
be as dogmatic as my honourable friend the
leader of the opposition, and say that it was
a bad thing to restore our dollar parity in
July 1946. Neither am I prepared to say
that the Canadian people went on a spending
spree just because the Canadian dollar was
restored to parity. I do not think they did.
There was a bottled-up demand, built up not
only during the period of the war but many
years prior to it. During the war a great
demand was made upon our manufacturing
facilities, and the natural thing to do, as soon
as possible after the war, was to restore our
equipment and capital goods to a position
where we could face the future with the latest
and best. Everybody rushed to do that, and
I think the great increase in the spending of
United States dollars resulted from the efforts
to replace and rehabilitate Canadian industry,
and to purchase the capital goods necessary for
expansion incidental thereto.
Had we not restored our dollar to parity at
that time we would have eontributed to an
increased cost of the things we needed, and
to the extent that we needed them and bought
them, the laid-down price to the people of
Canada would have been that much greater.
The alternative would have been to permit the
dollar to remain where it was and to subsidize
these things to the extent of the exchange
requirement, and then, through general taxation of the people of Canada, to get the money
to take care of the situation.
Suggestions have been made for the removal
of ail control and restraint. I am always satisfied to enter into a contest or a fight so long
as I know that either there are rules, or that
there are none. If there are rules, I want to

know what they are; and if there are no rules,
I proceed to take care of myself. If I were to
find that ahl countries have their own rules
and regulations regarding control and restraint,
I would be a very foolish person if I did not
take measures to protect myself economically.
Therefore, if some method of foreign exchange
and import control is necessary for the protection of Canada's economy, and we let our
currency seek its own level, the answer might
be that it would soon drop to such a level that
we could not afford to bring in anything
because we would not have the currency,
acceptable on any basis, to pay the price of
what we wanted to import. Thus we might
be limited to whatcver United States dollars
we could pick up on our own export market.
That is the alternative situation.
I like to feel at all times that I am free,
within the law, to do what I want in business.
But having regard to the greatest good to the
greatest number, and to the over-all picture
of our way of life, on the basis that Canada is
going to be here today and tomorrow and next
year, I recognize that we have got to take
measures that are designed to that end and
not for the immediate purpose of the moment,
unless they are necessary to preserve our
present position. For that reason I cannot
support the view that the solution would be to
let our dollar seek its own level, and that we
adjust ourselves accordingly, and take what
we can get.
I ram not prepared to accept that solution as
being a true and sound principle in the
administration of Canadian affairs at this
time; I think it would be wrong, and would
have a disastrous effect on our Canadian
economy.
Honourable senators, we must
remember that this is a question of whether
we want to be a "lone ranger" or wish to
pull with our neighbours ahl over the world.
Apparently the way in which we are going to
carry on as neighbours is by a method of
contact, communication and agreement. If we
are going to place our economy in such a
position that we are going to do what is best
for us aIl the time and refuse to enter into
compromise, sooner or later we are going to
run into difficulty. So far as individuals are
concerned, life is a matter of compromise, and
dealings between nations are more and more
becoming matters of compromise.
Unfortun-ately, when we have not been able to
compromise and have taken a position from
which we would not recede, the inevitable
result has been war.
I have digressed a little, and I now come
back to one further observation. I quite agree
with the statement that many of our difficulties over the high cost of living could be

MARCH 10, 1948
solved if every person had a proper conception
of bis position in this Canada of ou-rs. Whether
we are employers or employees, we ail have
to put sornething into the economy of Canada
if we expeet te get sornething out of it.
Employees who are always dernanding higher
wages, and employers who are always resisting
that demand as a matter of principle, help to
crente conditions that set those two classes in
our community against each other. We have
to recognize that there must be a spirit of
pa-rtnership between the two groups. The
employee who gets higher wages must be
prepared to give more in the way of work and
production, if we are going to be able to
carry on our economy without a spiral of
rising costs such as we have had to contend
witb for the last eighteen montbs or two
years. Something bas to happen somewhere
along the line to prevent costs from continuing to risc, otherwise the spiral will reach
sucb a dizzy height that it will topple aver.
If that happens there will be some degree of

economie disaster, wbich may possibly restore
us to common sense and enable us to start out
again on a more equitable basis.
One of the dangers inherent in tbis bill is
tbat of necessity it must result in a sort of
planned economy whicb will greatly restrict
the establishment of new industries within
Canada and make it more difficuit for our
young people, as they corne along, f0 get
settled in thei-r own businesses. The permits
and controls will bring about a reduction in
the supply of certain raw materials frorn other
countries, so that the distribution of available
supplies may have to be lirnited to recognized channels. Unless we are very careful,
something in the nature of a franchise could
easily be acquired by existing industries.
There is another point that I want to men,
tion. Lt is said. that travellers l'eaving Canada
these d-ays are subjected to a far more exacting examination of their persons and their
lugzage than was made even during the war.
I hasten fo ad1l that 1 myself have not
experienced an.y more difficulty in. this regard,
than I did in, wartime, but tbe newepapers
Lately have published a good many conmplainés
from Canadian visitors to the United States.
It seems to me that tbese coinplaints indicate
another danger inherent in this kind of legislation. When officiais are given a lot of
autbority, it is easy for them to want to use it.
Wbat is required is the diseeminatîon of a
good deal of restraint and. control, from the
top. I bave the greatest admiration for the
Minister of Trade and Commerce, who will be
responsible for the aàministration of this
measure, and I think his approach to it will
be a liberal one. If that approach can, be

223

maintained ail the way down from the top to
the officiais who make the aetual. examinations, the danger to which I have referred can
be reduced to a minimum. But persona who
are given autbority willi want to use it, and
that tendâency increases as you go clown the
line. Any resentment on the part of an
individual, citizen usually provokes further
exercise of the authority. However, we canflot eliminate this condition; the best we can
hope for is that it wil1 be minimized. Posaibly it, is good for us that it d.oes exist, because
it will teach us flot to fail in love with this
kind of planned economy, and we shall retain
our wish that the measure be removed from
the statute book as soon- as Ganada's position
makes it possible to have this done.
Hon. WISHART MoL. ROBERTSON:
Honourable senators, the honourable gentleman frorn Vancouver South (Hon. Mr. Farris),
who rnoved the second reading of the bill and
sa ably presented it for our consideration, is
of course entitled ta reply, if he sees fit, to any
of the arguments advanced against it. 'In the
meantime I should làke to refer brio.fly to
one or two points made this afternoon by my
honourable friend the leader opposite (Hon.
Mr. Haig).
As to the extent of unemployrnent in Canada
just now, I think my honourable frie*nd is
perhaps unduly alarmed. On the whole, I
believe that what unemployment we now
have is largely seasonal. If my memory
serves me rightly-and I arn speaking only
fromn memory--employment in Canada during
tbe past year reached a heigbt neyer attained
before.
Hon. Mr. HOWARD: That is right.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: And there is
every prospect that it will be as great or even
greater in the present year. So I think my
honourable friend's concern about unemployment is flot very serious.
Then he said that our shortage of American
dollars arose primarily because we shipped
such large quantities of goods overseas on
credit. That is probably true. It was generally felt a couple of years or so &go that
there would likely be a severe reduction in our
reserve of American dollars, and one of the
reasons given at that time was that we would
be selling a large amount of goods on credit
to the United Kingdorn and Europe generally.
But I think the situation was made much
worse than it otherwise would have been by
the severe winter in Europe a year ago and
the poor crops there last fail, as well as by
the delay in the settling of peace treaties.
As a result of these things Great Britain f ound

SENATE

herself in a position where she had to ask
that the supplying of goods to her by Canada
and the United States be accelerated to a
degree that had not been contemplated when
the original credit was granted. The general
understanding, both in Canada and the United
States, was that the credit would probably
extend over four years, but because of the
unprecedented conditions to which I have
referred, Britain has already used practically
all of the United States credit, and there is
very little left of the Canadian credit.
We could have refused to do what we did;
but as I listened last night to the reading oi
the White Paper prepared by the British Goverrnent-bearing in mind the change that
has taken place on this continent since we
made our loan, and westward flow of communism on the continent of Europe and the
distress of its hungry people-I doubted if any
thinking pcr-on in this country would say
that in the circumstances Canada did wrong
in extending the credit and in permitting it to
be accelerated.
The situation that we face today is bad
enough, but I have not the slightest doubt
that had we refiused to sell our goods to
Britain, France and other countries, the
Unîi(1 State would have been glad to take
theiw, in w1ich event

bhert would

e no crisis

today in the matter of dollar exchange.
Indeed, I an quite îure tiat the demand for
good- in the United Statei
ha- been so higlh
that that country would unhesitatingly bave
taken our -plus.
But will any honourable
senator -ay that we should înot have assisted
the wetern deimocracies as we did?
S-r;y la-t year there was a strong indication of an imipending temporary depression in
the United States. This was followed by :the
announcement of the Marshall Plan, which
created on this continent an unprecedented
wave of enthusiasm as to the future. My
honourable friend was quite correct when he
said that the primary cause of the tremendously large purchases which were made were
the result not only of the demand for consuner goods, but of the confidence that swept
this continent and the extensive plans for
the rebuilding of capital equipment--all of
which was followed by a wave of wide-scale
purchases of capital goods which was almost
unbelievable.
Those two factors probably
were the major ones which contributed to
make our financial difficulties greater than
may reasonably have been expected.
I recall Mr. Towers explaining certain
figures, and adding that conditions might
arise which would greatly enlarge present
estimates. That is the very thing that has
happened. Our extensive assistance to Great

Britain and the western European democracies, which were fighting for their lives,
accounts for the position in which we find oursel-es today. But even had we known what
was going to happen-and what is continuing
to happen in Europe-I doubt that any
honourable senator would have raised his
voice in objection to the policy we adopted.
My honourable friend bas argued that, this
condition having arisen by reason of the
accelerated demands not only for our own
products, but in some cases for goods imported
from the United States to be sold on credit,
all of which resulted within a short time in a
deficit of United States dollars, the situation
would have been much better had the government in July, 1946, refrained from bringing
the dollar back to parity. Later in his remarks
lie flirted with the suggestion that there should
be no controls at all. I rather su-pect that
what lie meant was that he looked forward to
a time when there would be no control at all,
not that we should throw the system overhoard at the present time. My honourable
friend who lias just spoken (Hon. Mr. Haytden) referred to that point.
I am sure that neither the leader opposite
nor any other honourable sonator. would
seriously advocate, in view of the tremendou>ly large and sou-ilivo American capital
in estmunt in this country, that there -hould
be no control. Indeed, there could he no such
tling as the Geneva t-ade agriteements unless
the participating countries pledgedi themselves
to control their cui-reiiies. No counirv is
going to bind itself to reductions in tariff and
letave

notlier country free

cuîrreicnv.

to depreciate

its

That conclusion is, obivious.

Now I wisl

to refer to the suggestion of my

honouirable friend that we would have been
letter off if the dollar had been left at its 10
per cent depreciated v alue. The policy he
appears to be advocating is that controls
should bu removed, but that the rate of
exliange under control should not b changed.
Tlat sems to be a fair argument, and there
isi a good deal to be said for and against it.

No country wishes to depreciate its currency
in so far as its

imports

are

concerned,

the

reason being that its imports would cost more.
A country is driven to devalue its eurrency
largely because the price level is so high that
il cannot sell to markets which are open to
it. That is exactly the situation in which
France found herself. Great Britain today is
in the throes of indecision. Her price level
is very high, thus placing ber at a disad-antage
in export markets. It has been argued by
sonme that she should further depreciate ber
currency; but as ugainst that there is the
argument that if ae d-id so the things she
bas to buy would cost much more.

MARCH 10, 1948

No one in Canada can say what the future
may bring as far as our exports are concernied.
But do we need the artificial stimulation of a
depreciated currency .such as my honourable
friend has suggested? If we want. to seil
goods to the United States or any other
country in the world, ail we have to do is
remove the permit restrictions, and goods will
fly out of this country as if they were being
sucked out by -a giant vacuum cleaner. I do
not know that conditions will always rem-a in
as they are; but certainly fromn the point of
view of export at the present time there is not
one single argument in favour of depreciation,
except as it affects one major industry to
which my honourable friend referred.
Another industry which hie may have had
in mind is the tourist industry.
It is obvious that when, rightly or wrongly,
the government put the dollar back te, par, it
was forescen that a tremendous volume of
purchases would be made in the United
States, and that under the most favourable
circumstances the cost of living would be a
very serious problem. As my honourable friend
pointcd out, the advýantage which accrued
fromi their action wvas that goods could be
purchased for less. Personally I believe that
stability is the important objective in trade
and investment, as in other matters.
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: And in currency.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: And in currency.
The curious argument is advanced that the
return of the dollar to par resulted in a cessation of investment from the United States,
and that the advantages of an increased flow
of money from that country to Canada werc
thereby lost; whercas, were our policy
reversed, American money would again move
in this direction. I suppose thýat my honourable friend, in referring to the period hetween
January and July, had in mind that there
was then a certain counterbalancing inflow of
American capital, particularly for the purchu.e of negofiable securities, which has since
been stopped.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Will my honourable
friend undertake to supply figures as to the
exehange situation between January 1 and
July 1, 1946; July 1 and December 1, 1946;
and the eleven months ended November 30,
1947?
'Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I shall certainly
endeavour to, do so. I cannot see why the
amounts of exchange at the end of each of
those periods should not be disclosed.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: The information is contaîned in the annual reports as of the end of

225

the year, but there is nothing to sbow how
exchange rose and fell.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I will ask for
those figures.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: They would he us'eful.
Hon. Mr. MacLENNAN: What will happen
when you get them?
Hon. Mr. RO'BERTSON: That remains to
be seen.
Regarding investments, it is a curious fact
that while we take some pride in the circumstance that during the war our government did
not borrow any money in the United States,
and that when provision was made by the
goverument for a possible boan from the
United States of $300 million, we accepted it
as perhaps unavoidable, though we did not like
the idea; yet our position fromn the point of
view of the national economy is cxactly the
samne as though we as individuals owed the
United States the samne amount of money, for
every dollar borrowed fromn a United States
creditor-whether it be borrowed by the government, the Export and Import Credit Bank,
or any individual or agency-must be serviced.
In due course interest must be paid-in
American dollars if the type of sccurity be
such as requires it-or our credit cannot be
maintained. In other wordýs, whetber you
borrow one way or the other, the boan must
be repaid. But, as the honoui'ahle senator
from Vancouver South (Honý Mr. Farris)
pointed out, the investment in Canada by
United States citizens is greater than in any
other country, and greater than the sum total
of American investments in the w bole of
Europe. It amounts te over $5 billion, of
which $2 billion is represented by plants and
similar enterprises and $3 billion by negotiable securities. Every one of theýsL investments must be serviced in due course at the

prevailing rate of interest, and at some time
or other the principal must be repaid. Sometimes re-borrowing and re-financing is resorted
to; nevertheless the borrowins wvi11
have to
be paid off.
Looking at the situation fromn this standpoint, it seems to me that, se far as American
mnvestment in Canada takes the forma of purchases of negotiable securities, and having in
view the tremendous sums of money available
in this country, it is no great disadvantage to
us if our financing is done at home. Indeed,
during the last year or two, the provinces have
retired a considerable part of their multiple
pay obligations--the ones which are to be paid
in American funds and for every hundred
dollars of which, when our dollar was depreciatcd by 10 per cent, they had to pay $110 as

SENATE

well as an additional amount on interest.
Every opportunity has been seized by these
provincial administrations to retire their obligations in the United States and to re-finance
themn in Canada. One of the reasons which
accelerated the demand for American currency
in the last eightcen months is that the Foreign
Exchange Control Board not only supplied
provincial and other authorities with American
exehange to retire their obligations, but permitted these authorîties to accelerate retirement if the obligation contained a permissive
clause. So apparently it is excellent business
as far as we are concerned to take every
opportunity we cao to retire indebtedness of
this type, in order that the drain on us for
additional interest and principal will bo correspondingly reduced.
But investment in Canada is in a different
category. The truth of the matter is that,
during the financial history of this country, the
periods when our dollar wvas at a depreciated
figure wore not those when American capital
came into Canada. From 1926 to 1930, the
period whon American investment, in Canadian
industry-by whicb 1 mean plants and milîswas at its height, our exchange was at par.
During the depression of the next three or
four years, when our dollar in relation to the
United States dollar depreciated as much as
20 per cent at one time, it might bave been
expected in the light of arguments we have
hoard that Canada would have wituossed a
great influx of United States money attracted
by the opport.unity of buying a dollar for
80 cents. But the fact is that, over that period
American investment in Canada actually
decreased somewhat.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: They were afraid.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: The ru-ling consideration is security. One may admit that
there is always somebody who will try to make
a few dollars by speculation, but the men
who invest money are motivated by confidonce. I suppose tbat if you wanted to deal
in exohange today, you could with une Canadian dollar buy 100,000 Chinese dollars. But
who would regard that as an investment?
Today would be a favourable time for Canadians and Americans to buy bonds and make
investments in Great Britain and Western
Europe, whero currencies are depreciated. But
is there any indication of a great outflow of
capital from this side to take advantage of
these dcpreciated currencies?
The greatest attraction to capital is stability,
the assurance that the investor will be paid
when the obligation is due and that repayment
will bc made in American currency. The
Americans think this country is stable, and

that is why they have invested more money
here than in any other country of the world.
If I were going to change the rate of exehange
for our immediate henefit 1 would eeriously
consider apprýeciating our dollar value. Honourable senators should remember that, over
3500 millions were spent for capital equipment
in this country last year, and tbat purchases
of farmn implements to the amount of $100
millions were made by Canadians in the
United States. In this connection I say to my
honourable frienti from South Bruce (Hion.
Mr. Donnelly) that if ho wore to buy a farma
implement worth $1.000 in the Unitedi States,
under the policy of his leader ho would have
to pay $1,100 for it. Is that not right?
Soine Hon. SENATORS: Yes.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: He would only
pay 31,000 for it under the presont rate of
exclhange. What is wrong with that? Would
anyone argue that businesses in this country
wvould not prefer to pay $500 million for
equipment instead of $550 million, as tbey
would bave týo do under the systemn advocated
by tbe honourable leader opposite? 1 would
go a stop further than he dýoes, and siiggest
that we appreciate our dollar and pay only
,S450 million for the equipment. Would that
not be good business.
Some Hon. SENATORS:

Oh, oh.

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Then I would
immediately anticipate running into trouble
from two different sources. First, my lionourable friend who has just ireferred to gold
(Hon. Mr. Hayden) would argue that at one
time golti cost $38.50 an ounce, -that it now
costs $35, and that I would want to reduce
it to $31.50. My reply would be that I would
be prepared to raise the ante for the benefit of the gold producers, in order to make up
the difference hetween my friend's policy and
my own. I would raise the extra money and
save untold millions.
The second source of trouble would corne
from the chairman of the Tourist Traffie
Committee. Ho would, argue that the Amenieau, dollar woulýd only be worth 90 cents in
Canada.
Porhaps that argument is more
dl:fficult to answer than tho other; but my
roply woul ho that when our dollar was at
a discount of 10 per cent in t.he United! States
it diti fot doter Canadians from visiting that
country andi spending their money there.
Perhaps, honourable, senators, the fact that
Canada was the only country in the world to
have it.s dollar appreciated in relation to the
Unitedi States dollar would arouse su much
curiosity among the American people that
thec) would, corne in droves to see what this
country was like.

MARCH 10, 1948

Some Hon. SENATORS:

Oh, oh.

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: However, I shall
not press that policy.
Some Hon. SENATORS:

Oh, oh.

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I would suggest
to my honourable friend opposite that, so far
as Americans are concerned, there is nothing
to be gained by depreciating our dollar with
respect to theirs; and when it comes to replacing our capital equipment and oil, coal and
other commodities which we have to purchase,
I suggest that he consider carefully and see
if he dioes not agree that, after all, we are
better off under the present policy of the
government than we would be if we adopted
the policy he and his party advocate.
The third, matter which I should like to
discuss is the iniquity of this government in
refusing permits to allow certain goods to be
exported to the United States. I admit it is
a diifficult problem, and that the agricultural
people of Canada have probably shown more
consideration than I would have done had I
been in their shoes. Ordinary common sense
and sound reasoning warns the agricultural
community that it is unwise to receive $3.50
or $3 a bushel for wheat for a limited period
Depriving
and then to starve for years.
industries, especially the agricultural industry,
of the opportunity of receiving high prices,
such as could be got in the United States at
the present time, is a very serious matter.
This problem certainly applies to practically
every branch of agriculture, andi particularly
to the wheat producer.
Hon. M-r. HAIG: And to the lumbermen.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Yes, except that
the lumbermen were given a certain quota
under which they cou-ld export at a higher
price.
The other day [ heard a dairyman complaining bitterly because the government had
refused him a permit 'to ship his whole milk
to the United States where, he claimed, he
could sell it at a high price. He even said
that despite a 14 cent duty he culd have
shipped his butter to the United States and
still made a profit of 10 cents a pound.
There are many angles to this problem.
My honourable friends know what they are.
In my judgment the fact that the agricultural
community has been called upon to pay the
shot means that if the time ever comes when
the present legislation, as it affects agricultural
prices, is dealt with, it will have to be
considered in relation to the position in which
agriculture now finds itself.
Honourable senators, I have nothing more
te say, except to assure my honourable friend

who bas referred to my free-trade instincts,
that this practical and temporary measure of
selective controls is a better system than the
one he advocates. If we were to depreciate
our currency it would affect our whole economie structure and make recovery increasingly difficult.
In conclusion, I wish to join with those
who trust that the world situation will ultimately be such that controls will no longer
be necessary.
Hon. ARTHUR W. ROEBUCK: Honourable senators, I spoke at so.me length on the
principles of this measure at a time when I
felt the public at large was giving consideration to it. I therefore have very little to
add today. I do feel impelled, however, to
reaffirm the principles which I laid down in
the previous debate: The cure for the ills
of freedom is more freedom.
Had the subject not been so serious I should
have been amused as I sat here and observed
a leader of the Liberal party arguing for protection and its principles, and a leader of the
Conservative party arguing for freer trade and
its principles.
I wish to join with the leader of the
opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig) and others in
complimenting the senator from Vancouver
South (Hon. Mr. Farris) upon his excellent
address, and particularly upon the skill with
which he put what I think was a poor case.
When yu start from a false premise you can
build a pretty house of cards. The false
premise from which the honourable gentleman
started was the situation which existed in
Canada prior to the introduction of this bill,
through the operations of the Foreign
Exchange Control Board. Assuming the false
premise that that board was a necessary evil
and that we had to do what was done, there
is of course very little answer to be made to
his argument that we should go on to still
further controls. One control always leads
to another, and we reach the position where a
fundamental free trader argues for greater
protection, from the false premise of protection already existing.
In the address which I previously made on
this subject I said:
The government's action will be approved and
its legislative program confirmed. Under the
eircumstances, there is nothing else that we
oan do.
I repeat. that now. There is nothing else
that we can do at this moment. We in this
house, be we free traders or not, or opposed to
controls-even though we dislike the bill as
strongly as does the senator from Toronto
(Hon. Mr. Hayden)-can do nothing but
vote for the bill.

SENATE

Arguments of the kind that we have heard
in support of the bill lead on inevitably to
a controlled economy. J must say that I
sometimes have a feeling of frustration and
s I see men who should be
pessimism
headed in the opposite direction, going on and
on, step by step, in the direction of a socialist
state. There is no precipice over which we
shall plunge in this matter. We shall go on
step by step, as we are doing now, moving
imperceptibly towards a socialist state.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Itear, hear.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: We are told that
there is necessity for controls. Well, they
have controls, have they not, in England?
England was never so controlled in all her
history, and English people are worrying about
how to get enough to eat and the clothes with
which to keep themselves warm. On the
European continent there is military control
and there is starvation, two years or more
after the conclusion of the war. So far as I
know, the country freest of control is the one
to the south of us. Our neighbours there
have abolished controls over prices and other
things of that kind. Unfortunately they have
not yet abolished their tariff controls, but
internally they have got rid of trade restrictions, and today goods are flowing freely from
free America te controlled, dominated and
half-starving Europe. I say to my colleagues
here, Liberals and Conservatives alike-for we
are all Canadians and anxious about the future
of our country-let us discontinue the practice
of adding one control to another, before we
find ourselves in a position similar te that of
Europe.
As I say, I have already made my position
on this matter clear, but I wish to emphasize
that the cure for the ills of freedom is more
freedom. Let me try to illustrate that. Trading is an individual inatter. It is carried on,
net in the mass, but by individuals buying
specific articles from one another. True, all
these purchases may be added up in a coluin
and the total published in a govrrnment
report, but trade consists of individual transactions. Of course, some people cannot see
them, just as some people cannot sec trees,
for the forest; while others cannot see the
forest, for they look only at the trees.
Let us suppose that an individual in the
state of Maine-that state is economically
comparable to one of our provinces-wants
to buy something in the city of New York,
but the price is more than lie can afford to pay.
I may say that all my life I have been in a
position of wanting to buy more than I could
pay for.
Hon. Mr. HOWARD: Who has not?

Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: That is a normal
condition. I have desisted from buying, net
because of soe
balance of exchange, but
purely and simply because I did not have the
necessary sum of money. And if an individual
in the state of Maine did net have enough
money to buy something that he wanted in
New York, he simply could not buy it. There
is the correction, working through the individual, net through the mass. Is that domination? No. It is surrender to circumstances.
But one difference between a possible purchaser in the state of Maine and another in
the province of Ontario is this, that the
Ontario individual is faced with a barrier erected by our Foreign Exchange Control Board,
whereas the person in Maine can, if he has the
money, trade with New York freely.
The Foreign Exchange Control Board
requisitioned all or practically all the American money in this country and formed a great
fund, which a year or so ago amounted to
$11 billion. The board took the whole question of exchange out of the hands of individuals. The address that J made on this
subject previously liad hardly been concluded
when word came to me that a gentleman who
sat net far from me had bought in the United
States a press for $200.000, that it had recently
been delivered, and the government had paid
the exchange. Well, by paying the exchange
on one transaction after another, instead of
letting things take their normal economic
course-in other words, instead of allowing
the ills of freedom to be cured with more
freedom-the government saw this fund of
S11 billion gradualy melt away like snow in
the sun. Having reached that crisis, then of
course the argument presented by miy friend
from Vancouver South (Hon. Mr. Farris)
applies. Something had to be done. But
instead of abolishing the Foreign Exchange
Control Board, and letting trade take its
natural course, the government adopted a
method of prohibiting trade between ourselves and our best customers in the world,
the people in the United States. Of course
J am opposed to tliat policy. I want to get
back to conditions as free as it is possible
to make them. I would give freedom of trade
to our people, irrespective of what other countries do. I am on the road to freedom all
the time, though perhaps net travelling very
fast in that direction.
It is rather unfortunate that the trend of
our time is towards socialism. J can sec it
right in this chamber, as I can elsewhere. One
after another we accept these government
interferences with private affairs, and we give
up the sound principles that guided our actions
in the past. Every day brings a crisis-last

MARCH 10, 1948

year it was the war, today it is foreign
exchange, tomorrow it will be something else.
There will always be a crisis, and as long as
Liberals are prepared to abandon their principles because of a crisis, then so long will
we progress towards the destiny of a controlled economy and a dominated people. As
I say, I see the new trend right in this
chamber. It is not confined to any one party.
It seems to be almost as prominent among
Liberals as among Conservatives, although it
would be more natural for them than for us.
In the House of Commons we now have a
party elected to promote this very program.
I do not fear it in the least, but I do fear the
lack of principle that I see about me, and the
willingness to accept the false gods of socialism rather than to cling to the sound principles
of Liberalism.
In conclusion, I simply wish t> reaffirm my
position. But there is no use voting against
the bill. If the government, in conjunction
with this bill, would bring in a proposal to
abolish the Foreign Exchange Control Board
and ask me to vote on the two, of course I
would vote against the board. If I had my
way I would destroy that institution, root and
branch, and leave our people free. But in this
hog-tied position what are we going to do?
You cannot refuse to put the stamp of approval
on a general policy although you regret,
deprecate, and disapprove of it. After distinctly stating my reservations and saying
that I am wholly against the principle of the
thing, my position is that I am going to vote
for the bill-at least I will not vote against it.

LOAN COMPANIES BILL
MOTION FOR SECOND READING

On the Order:
Second reading of Bill F, an Act to amend
the Loan Companies Act.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Honourable senators, I must apologize for allowing this item

Canadian Veterinary Medical Association.
He said: Honourable members, the provincial veterinary associations across Canada are
anxious to have a parent organization to which
they may all belong. I may say that all the
associations are in favour of the bill.
As I propose to move that the bill be
referred to the Standing Committee on Miscellaneous Private Bills when it has received

PRIVATE BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. J. G. TURGEON moved the second
reading of Bill C5, an Act to incorporate the
Canadian Association of Optometrists.
He said: Honourable senators, I will not
take the time of the house to explain the bill
now because, like my honourable friend (Hon.
Mr. Haig), I intend to ask that the bill, after
receiving second reading, be referred to the
Standing Committee on ýMiscellaneous Private
Bills. I may just say that the purpose of the

SENATE

legislation is to provide the nine provincial
optometrist organizations with a national
association.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: Has it anything to do
with prices?
Hon. Mr. TURGEON: If it has, the committee will find that out. I would say that it
has nothing to do with prices. The bill will
be explained fully in committee-.

ANIMAL CONTAGIOUS DISEASES BILL
SECOND

READING

Hon. WISHART McL.
ROBERTSON
moved the second reading of Bill D-5. an Act
to amend the Animal Contagious Diseases
Act.
He said: Honourable senators, the purpose
of this bill is to tighten up certain legal
provisions governing the export of infected
cattle to the United States. As honourable
senators are aware, the export of dairy and
breeding stock cattle from Canada to the
United States is permitted at present, although
there is a prohibition against the export of
beef cattle. Under our Animal Contagious
Diseases Act, cattle exported to the United
States must be certified free from disease by
Department of Agriculture inspectors. Cases
have come to light recently in which cattle
dealers and others have conspired to evade
the law by shipping infected animals in place
of the healthy animals for which certification
tags and certificates were originally issued.
By switching the certification tags and documents, the dealer could sell a low-priced,
diseased animal to an American buyer for the
high price of a healthy animal.
Acting on complaints from the United
States buyers and authorities that certified
animals imported from Canada were found to
be infected, the Department of Agriculture
initiated prosecutions against the offenders
under the Animal Contagious Diseases Act.
The existing provisions of the law, however,
were found to be insufficient to deter offenders,
partly because the six-month time limit for
prosecution w-as too short for the necessary

evidence to be secured, and partly because the
penalties were insufficient. The department
has therefore asked that the time limit for
prosecution be extended to two years instead
of six months, and that conspiracy te violate
the provisions of the Act be made an offence.
Offenders may then be prosecuted under
indictment as well as on summary conviction.
These two changes would have the effect of
closing the legal loopholes now in the act.
I have no further information of particular
importance with respect to this bill, but if
the house will' give it second reading I shall
be pleased, if any honourable senator so
desires, to refer it for further consideration
to the Standing Committee on Natural
Resources.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I think it should go there.
Hon. Mr. DAVIES: In 1947 there were several prosecutions under this Act. In a number
of cases with which I am familiar and which
seemed to me glaring offences the defendants
were found not guilty. Could the honourable
leader tell us whether they were found not
guilty because of some weakness in the Act?
I know that in one or two cases the verdict
was rather a surprise.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I am not in a
position to give the information for which my
honourable friend asks, but in view of the
fact that this legislation is regarded from a
legal point of view as more stringent than the
existing Act, such cases as those to which my
honourable friendi has referred may have had
something to do with the demand for revision.
The question is a pertinent one, and, with any
others which may occur to honourable gentlemen, could well be asked of the officials when
they appear before the Standing Committee
on Natural Resources.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the second time.

BUSINESS 0F THE SENÇATE
On the Orders of the Day:
Hon. WISHART MeL. ROBERTSO'N:
Honourahie senators, befere the Orders of the
Day are procccdcd with 1 should like te make
a bricf statemeet witb respect te the future
pregram of the bnuso. I shall givo honourable
senators as rnuch information as I can.
To bogie witb, yesterday, at the conclusion
of tho debate on tbhe motion for the second
rcading of the Emergeecy Exchange Conservation bill, I gave in undortakieg to the sponsor
of the Dairy Industry bill (Hon. Mr. Euler)
that discussion on that measuire would procecd
this aftcrnoon. Today, te meet the convenienco of the rnany witesscs te ho called
hefere the Committee on Banking and Transportation, I again requested the honourable
senator fer Waterloo te permit a further postpenemeet. This hoe bas graciously consented
te do. I told Iiim that 1 w1ould ask the hnourable senator (rom Grandville (Hon. Mr. Bouffard), who rnoved the adjourriment of the
debate, net te proceed until hoe, the honourablo
senator for Waterloo, bias returned te thp
house, probabIy eariy next wek.
It is rny intention te suggest when we
adjoure today that we stand adjourned te
Monday noxt at 8 e'ciock in the evoningý. On
our returo next week, we shahl proceed in cernmittee m-ith consideration of Bill 3, rospocting
Emergency Measures fer the Conservation of
Canadian Foreign Exchange Resources, which
was passed yestcrday, and with the subjectmatter of the Ceneva trado agreemnents. Ie
the bouse wc shail take rip the motion for
second reading of the bill te arnend the
Canada Shipping Act.
I bave Leen askced te intimate wliat is
intended with respect te the Easter adjourement, In vicî of the fact that I cannt form
an cstimate of how long the other place wiii
take te deai witb the Transitional Measures
bill and the Agriculturai Produets bill, both
cf whicli wil afterwards have te be considered
and passed in this place, and receive Royal
Asseet hefore the end of the rnontb, bonourablo seaters will appreciate my difflculty in
arriving at a conclusion.
I bave bee advised that atter tbo bill te
arnend the Canada Shipping Act bias received

second reading, there will be a considerable
lapse of time before the various deputations
interosted in the bill wiIl be ready to, corne
before the committeo. Therefore, when we
have conciuded whatevor business it is necessary for us to transact before the end of the
month I intend te proposo-unless somothing
should occur meanwhilc of which I arn nnw
entireiy unaware-that; we adjourn until Tuesday, April 13. The date of adjourrement will
depend entircly upon wben the legisiation I
have rcferred to wiil corne to this house. As
soon as I have any further information te give
the bouse, 1 slball ho only too happy to do so.
Hon. JOHN T. HAIG: Assurng. as 1 think
I arn entitled to do. that thie othor place wvill
take longer than thc next wckl to consider the
two bis thc leader bias mentioned, and considering that the first minister hm. announced
thiat the otýher place wiil adjouro on March 24
to March 30, wouid it he possible for members;
(rom the deýar oid province of Quebec and the
(lear oid province of Ontario te sacrifice thoraselv es te the extent of heing boere on the last
twe daYs of this montb, in order te aiiow
these of us wbo corne from "the sticks" te get
away that mueb earlicr?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I tbink that is
cntirciy up te the "dear nid province of
Ontario" and the "deai' nid province of
Qu ehe c.
Hon. WILLIAM DUFE: Honourahie sonators, max' 1 refer for a few minutes te the
remarks made by our gond fricnd the leader
of the goveronoent (Hon. Mr. Rohertson)
rcgarding the Easter adjourremeet? If I underStood him rigbtly, hoe is net quite sure as to,
wbcn it should begin. The othor bouse, I
helieve, is te adjourn on Wedncsday, March
24, te ro4îmne its sittings the following week.
That is quite proper bocauso, Goodncss knnws,
honeurahie members of tbat place have
wastcd enougb time already this session doing
nething. W'o wbo are bere waitieg te attend
te bus~iness sbmîld net bave te commnute from
our homes te Ottawa every fortnigbit or se,
a, I hav e had te do for the lagst sovon or eight
y ears. just te wait areund for certain people
eiscwbcre te get througb thieir work. I tbink
wc shouid stand on our dignity and deciare a
definite date of adjeeromont.
Then our
niembers wvould be abie te make plans--to
stay bore or go to Atlantic City or te Lunenhurg or Vancouver. or whorevcr ohse we
ch oose.
It scems te me that the oniy roason why we
migbt need to, postpone tbe adjourement until
after the 24tb is that we shall ho on hand te
pass the Supply Bill at the end of the rnontb.
There will ho ne other busine~ss and I subîmit,

MARCH 11, 1948
honourable senators, that it would be
unreasonable to call us back from the four
corners of the country for fifteen or twenty
minutes of discussion. Therefore, I suggest to
the leader that he ask the Minister of Finance
to arrange to have the Supply Bill sent over
to us not later than, say, Tuesday, the 23rd,
in order that we may pass it by the 24th and
adjourn that day.
Now may I say a word as to the length of
the adjournment? Of course, honourable
senators, we are a happy family, and those of
us whose homes are a long way fron Ottawa
do not mind waiting around he.re from Thursday night until Tuesday night while our
Ontario and Quebec colleagues are away. During those long week-ends we have nothing to
do but twiddle our thumbs and bite our
finger nails.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. DUFF: And most of us get into
trouble.
An Hon. SENATOR: "Speak for yourself,
John."
Hon. Mr. DUFF: I am speaking for myself.
It seems to me that some consideration should
be given to those of us who live in distant
parts of the country. I am getting tired of
having to commute between Lunenburg and
Ottawa. If there is business to be done, I
am willing to stay and do it; and although
I am a Presbyterian I am willing to work even
on Sundays, if neeessary.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Shame!
Hon. Mr. DUFF: I say I amn willing to
work on Sundays, if necessary, because I am
convinced it is God's work that we are doing
in this chamber.
Of course, I know the leader of the government will have to confer with his colleagues
of the cabinet before he can say whether it
will be possible for us to adjourn on the 24th.
Our leaders have always had to consult with
their colleagues about a Senate adjournment.
That is an old story. Seriously, in all fairness to those of us who are in business or
professional life and have large interests in this
country, I say we should not be called back
here when there is no work for us to do. And
there will not be anything ready for us by the
13th of April, which I understand was the
date mentioned by the leader. I say that
because in another place there are a number
of young gentlemen who want to talk their
heads off, as they expect an election this year.
I would respectfully suggest to my good friend
the leader that our period of adjournment
should be from the 24th of March to the
20th of April.

SENATE COMMITTEES
ACCOMMODATION FOR MEMBERS

On the Orders of the Day:
Hon. A. C. HARDY: I wish to call the
attention of the Senate to a matter which,
perbaps, is under the authority of the
Committee on Internal Economy. The room
usually occupied by our committees is a
small one, and the only seating accommodation
for senators who are not committee members
is in three or four rows of chairs situated
near the north wall. At a quarter past ten
this morning, fifteen minutes before the Committee on Transport and Communications
met, these chairs were all filled by people who,
although interested, were in no way connected
with the Senate. The result was that senators
who attended the meeting were scattered all
over the back parts of the room. I think the
seating arrangement should be such that at
least one row of seats would be reserved for
senators.
Our rules provide that any senator has the
right to attend and take part in any committee meeting, but I am sure he cannot do very
much if he is unable to get a satisfactory seat.
Incidentally, in the last two or three years
there has been a growing tendency on the
part of senators who are not members of committees to sit at the committee tables. The
result has been that in our very large
committees-such as the committees on Banking and Commerce, and on Transport and
Communications-the tables, which accommodate approximately twenty, are crowded with
non-members. This morning I counted ten
committee members who were forced to take
rear seats because of this practice. This does
not seem to be a proper situation. It has
been the custom to reserve the seats at the
tables for committee members, and it is quite
possible that some of the non-member senators who sat at the table this morning did so
because they were crowded out of their own
places.
I feel that this matter shouldi be taken up
by the proper authorities, so that committee
members may be assured of their proper
places, and senators who are not committee
members may be located where they can take
part in the proceedings, if they so desire.
Hon. Mr. WHITE: Honourable senators, if
this matter comes within the jurisdiction of
the Committee on Internal Economy, as chairman of that committee I shall certainly see
that the suggestions made by my honourable
friend from Leeds are carried out.
Hon. THOMAS VIEN: Honourable senators, I believe this is a matter that comes, not

SENATE

within the jurisdiction of the Committee on
Internal Economy, but rather that of the
chairman of the committee concerned. It is
true that a large crowd was present at the
committee meeting this morning, and senators
who did not have seats should have called that
fact to the attention of the chairman and
requested that the chairs improperly occupied by others be vacated.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: No honourable senator
wants to do that.
Hon. Mr. VIEN: Very true. I would therefore suggest that this situation be brought to
the attention of the two persons in this Senate who should be most interested in directing
action in this matter: the leader of the government and the chief whip.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. VIEN: This is a matter that is
always under the authority of the chairman
of the committee.
Hon. Mr. HARDY: Honourable senators, I
do not think my remarks are debatable.
THE LATE JAN MASARYK
TRIBUTES TO HIS MEMORY

Hon. WISHART MeL. R O B E R T S O N:
Honourable senators, I feel that I should not
let this occasion pass without reference to the
tragic death of Jan Masaryk, the Foreign
Minister of Czechoslovakia. Not only did he
bear one of the greatest names in the history
of his country and the world, but ha devoted
his life to his country's welfare and the
advancement of democratic ideals.
One of the advantages enjoyed by the
Canadian delegation to the United Nations
Assembly in New York in 1946 was to meet
and, know this great and outstanding world
figure. It was difficuit, even then, to feel
otherwise than that his position was far from
being a happy one. Since his country became
engulfed by the tide of Communism, it is easy
to understand that his position was unbearable.
Living as we do in this happy land, it is hard
for us to fully realize what the peoples of
Europe are suffering and the uncertainty of the
future which they face. It would be the height
of folly to believe that, because an ocean
divides us, their plight is no concern of ours.
When we contemplate the tragic events of
history, it is sometimes difficult to get the
right perspective; but if this latest event serves
to awaken the peoples of more fortunate couintries, including our own, to their responsibilities,
Jan Masaryk may not have dýied in vain.

Hon. JOHN T. HAIG: Honourable members,
I agree with the honourable leader of the government that those of us who were fortunate
enough ta attend the United Nations meeting
in the fall of 1946 can never forget Jan
Masaryk and the address he delivered before
the General Assembly a day or two after it
opened. The delegations were seated alphabetically, and those from Canada and Czechoslovakia were in close proximity. All the
delegates were formally introduced.
Following Jan Masaryk's speech on behalf of
Czechoslovakia, I took the liberty of walking
back and sitting down beside him. I complimented him on the speech he had made, which
rang with the hope of a free, Christian gentleman. While talking to him I said: "At times
you seemed a little hesitant."
He replied,
calling me "Canada": "You live in happy surroundings. Do you know who is at our back?"
That was a sufficient explanation.
We in Canada are greatly disturbed because,
for the second time in ten years, something
tragic has occurred in Czechoslovakia. Within
the past twenty years a large nuraber of people
from that country have settled in my province. They are a fine hard-working people, with
a Christian faith that stands therm in good
stead in these trying times.
We in the western world should take warning from this tragedy. Jan Masaryk did not
commit suicide; he gave bis life that the rest
of the world might fight for freedom. The
background of his actions within the past
week or two-and even my fleeting experience
with him in New York-indicate to me the
constant fear that leading men of that country
have had of recent developments in Europe.
I join in the sentiments expressed by the
leader of the government, and I congratulate
the world that such men as Jan Masaryk are
born ta give us such a splendid example. In
1939 Czechoslovakia paid a high price for
standing up for her freedom. She will in
1948 be called upon to pay heavily for clinging
to her freedom. We in the western democracies should remember that the borders of
Czechoslovakia are not very far from the
shores of Canada.
Hon. A. K. HUGESSEN: Honourable
senators, may I add just a word to what has
so eloquently been said by our two leaders?
I did not have as much opportunity as they
had to meet the late Mr. Masaryk; in fact, I
do not clearly recall whether I was actually
formally introduced to him or not. However,
Mr. Masaryk was head of the delegation from
his country to the preparatory commission
of the United Nations held in London during
November and December, 1945. As a member

MARCH 11, 1948
of the Canadian delegation to that assembly,
I had the opportunity on more than one
occasion of seeing him and listening to his
speeches. In this way I got a fairly clear
picture of the nature of the man. He was a
sincere and convinced democrat, a distinguished statesman and the son of an even
more distinguished man, Thomas Masaryk,
the founder and, first president of the Czechoslovakian republic.
Honourable members, it is becoming clear
that over a large part of Europe life for free
men is becoming impossible. Jan Masaryk
was born and brought up in freedom, and I
feel that all we can say now is that he took
the only means of escape open to him when
freedom no longer existed.
Arising out of this tragedy, I have two suggestions to make to the government. First,
it seems to me that there is now no manner
of reason under the sun why Canada should
send a minister to Czechoslovakia, as appears
to be contemplated according to the estimates
put before us the other day. To send a minister to Czechoslovakia under present conditions would appear to me to savour a little of
recognition of the government of that country, for which we now have nothing but
aversion and disgust. My second suggestion
is that the government should make perfectly
plain and abundantly clear to the present
government of Czechoslovakia that it will not
admit into this.country any new minister or
members of his staff to take the place of the
minister and' staff who resigned, from the
Czechoslovakian Legation in this city a few
days ago, and whose resignation we honour.
We do not want in this city any more festering nests of treachery and corruption such as
the Russian Embassy turned out to be not
so long ago.
I make these suggestions and ask the leader
on this side most respectfully to submit them
to his colleagues.
Hon. CAIRINE WILSON: I have no suggestion to make; but I should like to say that
I esteem it a very great privilege to have seen
a great deal of Jan Masaryk during the visit
he paid to Ottawa in 1941. He was a man of
great intellectual capacity, versed in many
arts, and withal, a most delightful companion
and a devoted son of his country. At that
time his sister, Dr. Alice Masaryk, was in the
United States in an institution to which she
had been taken after a very serious nervous
breakdown. I learned yesterday to my sorrow
that she is back in her native land, where she
must be suffering as much as or even more
than her brother did.

EXPORT AND IMPORT PERMITS BILL
CONCURRENCE IN REPORT OF COMMITTEE

The Senate proceeded to consideration of
amendments made by the Standing Committee
on Banking and Commerce to Bill U-3, a bill
to amend the Export and Import Permits Act.
Hon. Mr. BEAUREGARD moved concurrence in the amendments.
The motion was agreed to.
THIRD READING

The Hon. the SPEAKER: When shall this
bill be read the third time?
Hon. Mr. BEAUREGARD: Now.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the third time, and passed.
PRIVATE BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. L. M. GOUIN moved the second reading of Bill 0-5, to incorporate the National
Insurance Company.
He said: Honourable senators, this bill follows the usual and traditional pattern of the
model bill which we find in the first schedule
to the Canadian and British Insurance Companies Act, Chapter 46 of the statutes of
1932, page 266. Moreover it is in accordance
with a bill which I had the honour to introduce last year, and which is now chapter 83 of
the statutes of 1947.
The present bill contains all the usual
clauses. The amount of capital is to be
$1,000,000, divided into shares of $100 each.
It is provided that $300,000 must be subscribed
before the holding of the general meeting for
the election of directors. The head office of
the company is to be in Montreal.
Clause 6 enumerates the various classes of
insurance authorized-fire, accident and so
on-in virtue of the regulations adopted under
section 2, paragraph 2 of the Canadian and
British Insurance Companies Act, 1932.
Section 7 sets out the amount of capital,
namely $300,000, which must be subscribed
and paid before the commencement of business
in fire insurance and some other classes mentioned in the first paragraph. Subsection 2 of
this section states what additional amounts
are required for the purpose of undertaking
some other classes of business; and subsection
3 is to the effect that the company may transact all classes of insurance business, except of
course life insurance, when $500,000 of capital
has been paid up or when the amount of
capital together with surplus equals that su.m.

£36

SENATE

SENATE

Finally, in section 8, we find provisionssimilar to those in the Federation Insurance
Company of Canada Act, chapter 83 of the
statutes of 1947-to the effect that the
National Insurance Company of Canada may
acquire the business and the assets and assume
the duties, obligations and liabilities within
Canada of the French company La Nationale.
The Act to which I have referred, and which
was adopted last year, was concerned with the
French insurance company known as La
Foncière.
This bill lias been submitted to the Superintendent of Insurance and has received his
approval. The agreement to be entered into
between the company which is now praying
for incorporation and La Nationale, the
French company already mentioned, must
receive the approval of the Treasury Board.
The bill will come into force only on a date
specified by the Superintendent of Insurance
and published in the Canada Gazette. That
means, of course, that the Superintendent of

Insurance will have to be satisfied that all the
conditions prescribed by the Act and required
by the department have been duly fulfilled.
If it is the pleasure ofthe Senate to adopt
second reading of this bill, I shall move that
it be referred to our Miscellaneous Private
Bills Committee, where honourable senators
will have an opportunity to examine the incorporators and also to hear the Superintendent of
Insurance.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the second time.
REFERRED

Hon. Mr. GOUIN moved that the bill be

SENATE PROCEDURE
RULE 18A-PARTICIPATION BY MINISTERS IN
SENATE DEBATES

The Hon. the SPEAKER: Honourable
senators, before proceeding with the business
of the evening, I should like to call attention to
an incident that occurred last Tuesday, March
9, when I was unavoidably absent from the
senate. I find on reading the debates that, on
the Orders of the Day being cailed the government leader 'indicated the procedure to be followed in regard to certain bills. He said that
he would bring the Honourable Minister of
Transport into the chamber on the second reading of Bill E-5, an Act to amend the Canadian
Shipping Act. After the leader had moved
second reading of the bill, the Minister of
Transport would then have the opportunity,
under rule 18A, adopted last session, to take
part in the debate and give to honourable
senators any further information they might
desire regarding the bill.
At this point, the leader of the opposition,
the Honourable Senator Haig, stated that
although it was not in order now to debate
the proposed procedure, he wished to refer to
the government leader's statement as to the
authority for the Minister of Transport to be
in the senate chamber, and his right to speak
under rule 18A passed last session. I quote
now from the Senate Debates of March 9,
pages 201 and 202. Senator Haig said:
I am just as anxious as my honourable friend
to have this matter brought to a conclusion as
soon as possible. Legielation that is somewhat
dependent upon this arrangement is to corne
forward, and it would be inconvenient if it were
before us when we were discussing this change.
Nowadays, as in the past, our best work is done
in committee, where a deputy minister or some
other appropriate official can attend and give
his views.
But what I wish to refer to particularly is
the statement of the honourable leader that this
house, by amending its rules, alowed a minister
of the Crown to come into this chamber and
speak. I care not what amendment of our
rules we make. By the British North America
Act the Parliament of Canada is constituted in
three divisions-the Governor General, the Senate and the House of Commons; and there is
no precedent that I have ever heard of or been
able to find for permitting a member of one
house to enter another house and address its
members without their unanimous consent.

237

A short debate then took place, and I quote
from what the honourable Senator Dupuis
said on page 202:
May I ask the leader of the opposition if he
considers the rule passed last year unconstitutional?
Honourable Senator Haig replied:
My point is that it is not a question of a
rule but one of the constitution. Under the
constitution ilt is provided that only senators
may speak in the Senate, and nobody else has
any right to do so. Anyone other than a senator
who appears here will be a stranger on the
floor, and I will ask to have him removed.
That is my right.
That is the position we now find this matter
in, and J think it should be clarified. The
Honourable Senator Haig has referred to the
British North America Act. Of course, we all
understand that that Act brought about Confederation and established the form of parliament to govern Canada, but it was left for
the two branches of parliament to devise rules
of procedure for carrying on the functions of
government. These have been amended and
re-amended from time to time as circumstances
required.
If the honourable senators are sufficiently
interested as to the origin of the rules of the
Senate, they will find in volume I, Journals
of the Senate, 1867-1868, the first session of
the Canadian parliament, the procedure then
adopted to formulate rules applicable to the
functions of the Senate. They will also find
in Bourinot's Parliamentary Procedure, 4th
Edition, at page 200, Chapter VI, the origin of
the rules, orders and usages of the Canadian
Parliament.
There was nothing new, or startling, in the
procedure adopted last year. Our rules were
amended by adding rule 18A, which reads as
follows:
18A. When a bill or other matter relating
to any subject administered by a department
of the Government of Canada has originated in
and is being considered by the Senate or in
Committee of the Whole, a Minister representing the department, not being a member of the
Senate, may enter the Senate Chamber, and
subject to the rules, orders, forms of proceedings, and usages of the Senate, take part in the
debate.
The subject-matter of this rule has been
under consideration at various times in the
Senate, and I should like to calt members'
attention to a debate that took place here in
1934 on a motion of the late Senator Murphy.
The debate begins at page 136 of the Senate
Hansard of 1934. This debate would be interesting to senators who care to read it, as it
gives the attitude of many members of the
Senate on the question of facilitating the

SENATE

introduction of more goverrnment measures in
the Senate. I wish more particularly to refer
to a statement made by the late Honourable
Mr. Dandurand, who was then leader of the
opposition in the Senate. He said, at page 139:
I wonder whether it would net be opportuneand I leave it to the discretion of my right
honourable friend-to anend our rule so that
ministers of the Crown in the other house could,
if so inclined, corne into the chamber. Deputy
ministers are permitted to come to the floor of
the Senate. Why should not ministers sit with
us and take part in the discussion reg'arding
legislation emanating from their departments?
The Right Honourable Mr. Meighen, who
was then leader of the government in the
Senate, said, at page 142:
As the honourable senator opposite me (Hon.
Mr. Dandurand) has very clearly shown, the
rules could be so amended as te invite ministers, and really make it their duty to corne
when invited, to expound their measures. Their
right to do so should not be restricted in any
wnay except by motion duly carried in the
chamiber to which they went. Of course, the
power of each chamber to control its own proceedings must remain supreme; therefore the
attendance of a minister must necessarily be
subject to such rules as the chamber might
prescribe to govern his presence and his rights
wliile le is within its bounds. Very little
nechanism is necessary for tis purpose. J
I
fancy it could be done by joint resolution.
lae no douubt it eould be done by amendment
two houses. It is assumed
to the ruiles of the
that such visiting ministers, if we may so deinminate them. would have no right to vote;
we could not give them the rigtt constitution-

ally; but the right to speak and to explain is
very distinct from the right to vote, and I do
not think lthere can be any question as to our
constitutional powers in respect of this limited

righit.
In the debate the other night the senator
from Toronto (Hon. Mr. Campbell) inquired
of the leader of the opposition (Hon. Mr.
Haig) if te proposed te take objection when
the Minister of Transport appeared on the
floor of the Senate. The leader of the opposition answered. "I do."
With that statement in view, I think it
opportune and wise that I should rule now.
As senators will understand, I have no alternative but to apply Rule 18A, which is now a
rule of the Senate, and must guide the
Any interruption or interference
Speaker.
when the minister arrives and is on the floor
of the Senate would be entirely out of order,
and I so rule.
It was unfortunate that the constitutional
aspect was not discussed when the resolution
was under debate last year. but if there is a
feeling that constitutional difficulties are
present, it is within the right of any member
to give notice under Rule 23, expressing his

desire to abrogate Rule 18A. This would permit him to state his objections on constitutional grounds, and give members an opportunity to debate the question.
I think, in the interest of the Senate, it
would be wise to have this debate, and clarify
the atmosphere 'before the minister comes to
the Senate, if he should come, to explain the
Act to amend the Canada Shipping Act.
EMERGENCY

EXCHANGE CONSERVATION BILL

OFFICIAL HOLDINGS OF GOLD AND
U.S. DOLLARS

On the Orders of the Day:
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Honourable senators, in the course of the debate on the second
reading of Bill 3, an Act respecting Emergency Measures for the Conservation of Canadian Foreign Exchange Resources, the leader
of the opposition asked me to undertake to
get certain figures respecting our foreign
exchange position as of January 1, 1946 and
at intervals up to last November 30. I have
made inquiries, and it appears that the Minister of Finance, in reply to a question asked by
Mr. Bracken, tabled these figures in the other
place on December 8 last. I have secured
a copy of this document, which I now beg
leave to lay on the table of the Senate, with
the suggestion that it be incorporated in our
records.
I table every document which I receive, but
unfortunately all documents are not sent to
me. I apologize to the leader of the opposition for having missed this particular return.
If at any time he or any other honourable
senator advises me that some document bas
been overlooked, I shall be most willing to
secure copies and to table them in this house.

(Sec appendix at end of today's report)
EMERGENCY SITTINGS OF THE
SENATE
MOTION

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Honourable senators, with leave, I would move the resolution
with respect to calling emergency sittings of
the Senate which has been customary in recent
years. As honourable senators know, there are
times when we are not meeting and the other
house is in session, and when, should exceptional and unforeseen circumstances arise, it
would be of advantage if the Speaker were
empowered to call the Sienate. Honourable
senators who live at some distance from
Ottawa would be benefited if they knew that
only a very brief sitting was anticipated.

MARCH 15, 1948

I had intended to move this resolution early
in the session, and I apologize for nlot
having done sa, but I overlooked it. Sa, with
leave of the Senate, 1 would move:
That for the duration of the presenýt session
of Parliament, should an emergency arise during
any adjournrnent of the Senate, which would in
the opinion of the Honourable the Speaker
warrant that the Senate meet prior ta, the time
set forth in the motion for such adjaurnment,
the Honourable the Speaker be authorized to,
notify hoaurable senators at their addresses
as registered with the Clerk of the Senate to
meet at a time earlier than that set out in the
motion for such adjournrnent, and non-receipt
by any ane'or more honaurable senators of such
cail shall fot have any effeet upan the sufficiency and validity thereaf.
The motion was agreed ta.

While I arn nat in a position to make a

or wben we shall corne back, I arn informed
that the other house is nlot likely ta conclude

this week its labours on certain legislation that

It is probable that we shall be bere until
Wednesdlay, tbe 24th, and the Prime Minister
bas even suggested that tbe business rnay nlot
be dispased af befare the 25th. The Senate
is always willing ta expedite in every possible

way the work of parliarnent, but the last word,
of course, remains with the other place. I
would, however, remind the other bouse that
legisiation does not become law upon its passage there. It must also receive sucb careful
consideration as, ini the opinion of bonourable
5853-17

senatars, it requires, and due recognition
should be given ta thîs fact, and a reasanable
time allowed for that purpose.

humble judgment at least, is, if not the
greatest, one of the greatest Prime Ministers
Canada bas ever had. I am sure that, upon

all of us, regardless of our political leanings,
wish him many years of health, of peace, and
of sweet content.
I have a great admiration for the traditions
of the Sonate, and it is because of these sentiments of regard that I appreciate so much
what bas been said bere tonight.
As I go back to the old alma mater and see
that grey quadrangle of the University of
Edinburgh-it is exactly forty years ago
since I entered its portals-I shall recall the
kindly references which the leaders have made
on behalf of both parties tonight.
SENATE COMMITTEES
DATES

OF MEETING

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Honourable senators, the dates appearing on the back of
today's Order Paper, which indicate that the
Standing Committee on Banking and Commerce is to meet tomorrow and the Standing
Committee on Canadian Trade Relations on
Wednesday, should be reversed. The transposition is in no way the fault of the Clerk
of the house, but of a culmination of circumstances. The Canadian Trade Relations Committee is to meet tomorrow morning, and the
Committee on Banking and Commerce on
Wednesday morning. I think notice bas been
sent to the mombers of the Canadian Trade
Relations Committee accordingly.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: J regret that I shall be
unable to attend the meeting of the Committee
on Canadian Trade Relations tomorrow.
Twelve men were appointed to the Standing
Committee on Divorce, but at times it is
difficult to have even six members present
at its meetings. If the honourable senator
from Westmorland (Hon. Mr. Copp) and myself do not attend tomorrow, only four members will be left, se we have to be present.
I would ask the honourable leader opposite,
in se far as the committee on Trade Relations
is concerned, to consider following the procedure adopted in another place and dividing
the resolution se that the Geneva agreements
and the British preference may be discussed
separately.

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I can assure my
honourable friend that, as soon as I have
ascertained the proper procedure to be followed, I intend to ask this bouse to take
action along the lines suggested.
PRIVATE BILL
SECOND

READING

Hon. J. F. JOHNSTON moved the second
reading of Bill P-5, an Act to incorporate
Canadian Co-operative Livestock Packers
Limited.
He said: Honourable senators, in rising to
move second reading of this bill I wish to say
that I bolieve this is the first time a bill of
this nature lias been before this bouse.
The bill is entitled "An Act to incorporate
Canadian
Co-operative Livestock Packers
Limited." In 1944 the Herse Co-operative
Marketing Association Limited was organized
and incorporated under a statute of the province of Saskatchewan. It carried on under
that statute until the presont time. but it bas
grown to such an extent that it needs more
scope. As the company is receiving surplus
horses from the three prairie provinces and
British Columbia, and from as far east as
Fort William, Ontario, it is necessary that it
ask the Dominion Parliament for incorporation.
I have bore a lengthy memorandum, but as
I intend to move that this bill be referred to
the Standing Committee on Natural Resources,
I do net think it is necessary to read the
memorandum now.
Hon. JOHN T. HAIG: Honourable senators,
the honourable senator from Central Saskatchewan (Hon. Mr. Johnston) spoke to me
about this bill the other day, and I asked him
to get an opinion from our Law Clerk with
respect to it. I suggested this because this
is a new type of bill; at least, I can find
no record of this bouse ever passing a bi!
regardýing co-operatives. It bas always been
the practice of this house te get uniform bills,
such as in the case of the Insurance Act and
the Loan Companies Act. The proposer of
this bill very kindly secured the opinion of
the Law Clerk, and it would seem that he as
no objection to what is proposed by the hill;
but be raised a point which I think would be
of interest to honourable senators: be said lie
would like the Under Secretary of State to
sec that the company is net given greater
powers than would be given under the Companies Act. The Law Clerk was of opinion
that this company could net be incorporated
under the Companies Act and would have to
secure a special act. He expects that he wili

MARCH 15, 1948

have the opinion of the Under Secretary of
State tomorrow, and will be able to pass it
on to the conimittee.
However, in the case of private bills there
must be seven days' notice given in this house,
and that rule might result in considerable
delay. I suggested that if the Under Secretary of State was of opinion that the bill came
under the Companies Act, I would consent to
the rules being waived in order that it could
be brought before the Standing Committee
on Private Bills prior to adjournment.
I am in favour of the bill being read a
second time now.
The motion was agreed

to, and the bill

the nationalization of inter-imperial communications. It is necessary, therefore, for the Canadian Marconi Company to have power to sell
its radio-telegraph and radio-telephone service
to the government, when the time comes. As
I have said, the company is seeking in this bill
nothing but the same powers of sale of a part
of its undertaking as are automatically conferred upon every company that is organized by
letters patent under the provisions of the
Companies Act, inasmuch as it is a matter
affecting communications.
I would suggest that the bill, if given second
reading, be referred to the Standing Committee
on Transport and Communications.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the second time.

Hon. Mr. JOHNSTON moved that the bill

Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN moved that the bill

PRIVATE BILL
SECOND

READING

Hon. A. K. HUGESSEN moved the second
reading of Bill Q-5, an Act respecting the
Canadian Marconi Company.
He said: Honourable senators, this is a very
simple bill. It is designed to give the Canadian
Marconi Company, which was incorporated by
a special Act of parliament, the same powers to
sell any part of its undertaking which are conferred automatically upon companies incorporated under the Companies Act by letters patent.
The reason the Canadian Marconi Company
wishes to obtain the power to sell any part of
its undertaking is that it carries on a number
of diverse activities. For one thing, it operates
a worldwide radio-telegraph and radio-telephone service, the sending station being located
in Drummondville, Quebec, and the receiving
station at Yamachiche, Quebec. That is one
branch of the company's activities. Then in
Montreal it has a plant for the manufacture of
radio equipment, and it also operates a radio
station.
More than two years ago the government of
this country announced that, as a result of an
interimperial communications conference held
at London in the summer of 1945, it would
ultimately seek to obtain public ownership of
this overseas radio-telegraph and radio-telephone service, as part of an agreement between
the different countries of the commonwealth for

DEBATES
Hon. JOHN T. HAIG: Honourable senators,
before the Orders of the Day are called, I rise
in my place on a question of privilege and
again protest against the calling of any person,
other than a senator, to appear and speak in
this house.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: My honourable
friend (Hon. Mr. Haig) is entirely out of
order, and I am surprised that he should take
such a position at this time.

SHIPPING BILL

SECOND READING
On the Order:
Second reading of Bill E-5, an Act to amend
the Canada Shipping Act, 1934.
ROBERTSON
Hon. WISHART McL.
(Leader of the Government) withdrew from
the Senate, to return accompanied by Hon.
Lionel Chevrier, Minister of Transport, whom
he presented to His Honour the Speaker and
then escorted to a seat in ti chamber.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: Honourable senators, I think it is proper and fitting for me
to tender a welcome to the Honourable Mr.
Chevrier, Minister of Transport, and to thank
him for corming to this chamber. He is the
first minister of the Crown to come here to
present legislation since the amendment of the
rules of the Senate last session. I believe that
honourable members of this chamber are hopeful that this innovation will bring other ministers to the Senate with their legislation. We
believe that this practice, if established, will
draw the two branches of parliament more
closely together and foster a confidence
between them that wihl be in the public
interest, and that it wýill also facilitate the
work of the ministry and the work of parliament.
I thank you, Mr. Minister, for your courtesy
in coming to .us today.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON moved the second
reading of the bill.
Hon. LIONEL CHEVRIER (Minister of
Transport): Mr. Speaker, first may I say to
you how grateful I am for the very kind and
cordial welcome which you have extended to

me on behalf of yourself and honourable
members of the Senate? I should like you, sir,
and honourable senators, to know that I deem
it not only a privilege but a great honour to
have the opportunity of introducing and discussing in this chamber legislation having to
do with amendments to the Canada Shipping
Act. If I am properly informed, this occasion
is one which creates a precedent. For that I am
indebted to honourable senators, and at the
same time deeply honoured. Without saying
more, honourable senators, I should like to
enter upon immediate consideration of the
bill to amend the Canada Shipping Act.
The Canada Shipping Act, 1934, was enacted
by parliament in that year after lengthy discussion and consideration in the Sen'ate. Since
that time it has been twice amended, first by
chapter 23 of the statutes of 1936, and again
by chapters 6 and 26 of the statutes of 1938.
The present bill proposes further amendments.
As honourable senators know, the Canada
Shipping Act is divided into sixteen parts,
each having to do with a particular phase of
maritime law. The proposed amendments
deal with five divisions of the Act. The first
lias to do with the certification of officers; the
second, with shipping of seamen; the third,
with steamship inspection; the fourth-a
new section-with fatal accidents; and the
fifth, and last, with certain of the international
conventions, four of which were approved at
the conferener at Seattle. I should like to deal
with the five divisions seriatim.
Part II of the Act deals with the certification
of officers. It provides that all ships shal]
have properly qualified masters and mates,
and also makes provision for the examination
and certification of these officers who man
the ships. During the war years, owing to
the prevailing scarcity of these officers, the
government considered it advisable to pass
an order in council under the War Measures
Act, permitting a certain relaxation of Sections 113 and 114, and permitting the clearance
of ships in pursuance of sections 132 and 133.
Perhaps I should take a moment to discuss
the order in council, which is P.C. 4306, of
June 17, 1941, made under the War Measures
Act.
The order in council was renewed
pursuant to the Continuation of the Transitional Powers Act last year, and is now before
parliament for a further renewal until March
31, 1949. That order in council gives the
minister permission to grant to any registered
ship a clearance on a voyage, even though
the master or mate of such ship has a certificate of lower grade than that required by the
Canada Shipping Act of 1934. The minister
may also grant permission to act to a second,
third or fourth grade engineer, who holds a

MARCH 16, 1948

certificate of a lower grade than that required,
subject to the one condition that the minister
must be satisfied that a properly certified
officer cannot be procured before the ship sails.
Section 133A as proposed by the bill enacts
provisions which are substantially the same
as those contained in Order in Council P.C.
4306. I should like to direct the attention of
honourable senators to the fact that if parliament approves the new section 133A, it will
be the same as Section 78 of the British
Merchant Shipping Act, 1906. This Act gives
the Board of Trade, now the Ministry of
Transport, power to exempt any ship from
the observance of any such requirements of
the Merchant Shipping Acts. It is considered
that such a provision is urgently needed at
this time in view of the lack of properly
qualified officers and the necessity to keep
our ships moving. In fact, it is considered in
the interests of the maritime industry and of
the operation of ships that in cases of
emergency there be some provision for relaxing the requirements contained in sections 113
and, 114, 132 and 133 of the present Canada
Shipping Act.
Other amendments proposed relate to Part
II of the Act, dealing with certificated officers,
but I shall not refer at any length to that
section of the measure.
I pass on now to Part III of the Act, which
provides in great detail for the shipping of
seamren and the rights and liabilities of seabetween
differentiates
This part
men.
seamen who ply on inland waters and those
who sail the seas. It contains special provisions for the protection of seamen, who as a
class have always been considered and
regarded as favourites of the law. The government bas given the most careful consideration
to various representations made on behalf of
the seamen, and has decided that certain provisions of Part III of the Act should be
amended to bring the measure more into line
with modern conditions of employment.
Various amendments of Part III are proposed, and I shall deal with these as quickly
and briefly as possible. For instance, there is
section 228A, which deals with international
labour conventions. This is a new section,
which gives the effect of legal authority to
the four conventions established and passed
at Seattle, and which the government bas seen
fit to introduce in these amendments. I shall
refer to these conventions in greater detail
later, because they form a major part of the
bill.
Thien there is the provision contained in
section 144A for the appointment of shipping
masters. Shipping masters at the moment
are paid by fees of office. It is proposed to

243

appoint them under the Civil Service Act, so
that they will be paid, a salary in lieu of fees.
Section 222 of the Act bas to do with the
disposition of the property of deceased seamen. This section has been found rather
cumbersone, and it is thought advisable and
wise to amend, it so that, where there is no
administrator or executor of a deceased seaman's estate, the department or the minister,
as the case may be, may transfer the moneys or
other properties belonging to the seaman to
bis heirs at law.
the
too,
recognizes,
government
The
importance of the galley in the life and work
of a seaman. Provision is made, in section
227A, to require foreign-going steamships of
1,000 tons or over to carry certificated, cooks.
One of the International Labour OTganization
conventions which is set out in the schedule
to the bill also makes provision for the certification of ships' cooks; but as this convention depends on other nations for its ratification, it is considered desirable to legislate
independentl·y, so that there shall be no delay
in requiring Canadian ships of this class to
carry certificated cooks.
I might also mention the amendment to
section 244 which deals with desertion. If
this amendment is approved by parliament,
the penalty of imprisonment for desertion or
absence without leave in Canada will be
abolished. In this respect the bill will be very
similar to that of the United Kingdom. There
is also a new subsection to section 244, which
states that a seaman is not guilty of an offence
under this section by reason only of his taking
part in a lawful strike after his ship has been
placed in security in a Canadian port.
There are a number of important amendments contained in the part of the bill which
relates to steamship inspection. Provision is
made for the inspection of classed vessels or
ships; that is to say, ships that are classed at
longer intervals than one year by an approved
classification society such as Lloyd's or the
British Corporation. The Act now provides
for an annual inspection of steamships, and
representations have been made that as classed
ships are already inspected annually by classification society surveyors a complete drydocking inspection of a vessel by a Canadian
steamship inspector should not be required
every year. After careful consideration of
these representations the government has
decided that steamship inspection requirements
for class ships should be modified, so as to be
more in line with classification rules; and the
amendment to section 387 provides for an
inspection of classed ships at such longer intervals than one year as the Governor in Council
may prescribe. I should like to point out,
however, that it is not intended to relieve

244

SENATE

classed ships from annual inspection se far as
life-saving and fire extinguishing equipment
is concerned.
There arc other important amendments contained in the bill that I should say a word
about. They affect Part VII. Clause 1 of the
bill contains a definition of "pleasure yacht"
which makes it clear that such a vessel cannot
be used to carry passengers as a matter of
business and retain its status as a pleasure
yacht exempt from annual inspection and the
requirements of the Act relating to the carrying of certificated officers. The new definition
of "pleasure yacht" seeks to make these vachts
subject to the requirement of certifica.ted
officers, as set out in section 113 or 114, as the
case may be.
Then again the same may be said of sailing
ships. "Sailing ship" as defined in the Act
means a ship wholly propelled by sails. Ships
which are equipped with propelling machines,
even though also equipped with sails, will
become subject to steamship inspection. Incidentally, this amendment is in line with a
special board of inquiry set up under the chairmanship of Mr. Justice Cannon, District Judge
in Admiralty of the Exchequer Court of Canada, who was appointed a Commissioner under
a Royal Commission te inquire into and
report upon the navigation of small vessels on
the St. Lawrence River.
Another important amendment relating to
steamship inspection contained in the bill,
authorizes the minister, acting on the advice of
the Chairman of the Board of Steamship
Inspection, to permit relaxations of steamship
imspection requirements in cases of emergency,
where such action is in the public interest.
Again I refer te another order in council,
P.C. 2245, which was passed on March 23, 1942,
by virtue of the War Measures Act. This order
in council was extended under the Continuation of the Transitional Powers Act, and is
agai before parliament for a further extension
to March 31, 1949. This order in council has
to do with the exemption from steamship
inspection in certain circumstances. The Chairman of the Board of Steamship Inspection is
authorized to relieve the owner of any ship
from compliance with the provisions of part
VII of the Act, which deals with steamship
inspection. Of course, if he considers it necessary to relieve the shipowner from compliance,
he mnut be satisficd that the ship is seaworthy.
Had it not been for this provision, it would
have been impossible during the war, and even
after, to carry out the intention and meaning
of the Canada Shipping Act.
I wish to point ont that section 488A is the
section which will, in effect, enact the provisions of Order in Council 2245. This section
is modelled along the linos of a section in the

1906 Merchant Shipping Act of the United
Kingdom, which gives the Ministry of Transport power to dispense with the observance of
any requirement of the Merchant Shipping
Act of that country.
The fourth part of the bill is new and contains amendments relating to fatal accidents.
In the various provinces of Canada today an
ordinary workman-I am net referring to a
merchant seaman-is entitled to Workmen's
Compensation in case of injury, and his dependents are entitled to compensation in case of
his death. There is also provision in the Fatal
Accidents Act of the province of Ontario which
enables the dependents of a worker who has
been killed to institute an action against a
third party, if the third party bas been neghi
gent; and if there is a difference between the
amount of damages awarded and the amount
of the Workmen's Compensation, the dependents have the right to select whichever is
the greater of the two. This new section is
introduced se that the dependents of a seaman
who has been killed may institute an action
in rem against the ship. It is the feeling of
the government that this is a desirable amendment. At the present time there is no provision in the Act that entitles the dependents
of a person who lias died as the result of injury
caused by a ship te take proceedings in rem
against the ship. It has been held that the
Exchequer Court on its Admiralty side has
no jurisdiction to entertain an action in rem
in respect of fatal accidents. This provision is
to remedy that defect in the law, and to
enable dependents of deceased persons to take
proceedings in rem in the Court of Admiralty
in any case where the deceased person would
have had the right to maintain an action if
death had not ensued.
The schedule to the bill has to do with
international labour conventions, and sets out
four conventions which the government proposes to ratify and make effective by regulatiens of the Governor in Council. These
conventions are the Medical Examination
(Seafarers) Convention, 1946; the Certification of Able Seamen Convention, 1946; the
Food and Catering (Ships' Crews) Convention, 1946; and the Certification of Ships'
Cooks Convention, 1946.
The convention concerning the medical
examination of seafarers provides that no
person shall be engaged for employment in
a seagoing vessel unless he holds a medical
certificate attesting to his fitness for the
work for which he is to be employed at sea.
Certain small seagoing vessels of certain
classes are exempt from the provisions of this
convention. This convention also provides
that each government is to prescribe the
nature of the medical examination to be

MARCH 16, 1948

made and the particulars to be included in
the medical certificate, and also the period
during which the certificate remains in force.
The medical examination of seamen is not
provided for by virtue of any section in the
Canada Shipping Act as it stands today.
The convention concerning the certification of able seamen provides that no person,
other than an officer or leading or specialist
rating, shall be engaged on any vessel as an
able seaman- unless he is deemed to be
competent to perform any duty which may
be required of a member of the crew serving
in the deck department, and un:less he holds
a certificate of qualification as an able seaThis convention also provides that
man.
each government shall make arrangements
for the holding of examinations and the
granting of certificates of qualification, and
that no person shall be granted a certificate
unless he has reached the minimum age as
fixed by each government, which shall not be
less than eighteen years, and unless lie has
served at sea in the deck department for a
minimum period fixed by each government,
which shall not be less than thirty-six months
and has passed an examination of proficiency. Certification of able seamen is also
not required under the Canada Shipping
Act as it now stands, the Act providing only
that a seaman shall not be entitled to the
rating of A.B. unless he has served three
years at sea.
The convention concerning food and catering for crews on board ship provides for the
promotion of a proper standard of food
supply and catering service for crews of seagoing vessels which are engaged in the transport of cargo and passengers for the purposes
of trade. The convention contains many
provisions designed to ensure proper food
supply and catering services for seamen on
seagoing vessels.
The convention concerning the certification of ships' cooks provides that no person
shall be engaged as a ship's cook on a seagoing vessel unless he holds a certificate of
qualification, and that each government shaH
for the holding of
make arrangements
examinations and the granting of certificates.
The existing provisions of the Canada Shipping Act do not require certificated ships'
cooks.
These four conventions apply to seagoing
ships and would not affect the operation of
ships which ply on inland waters, except possibly in respect of the engagement of an able
seamnan, who, being an inland waters sailor,
wished to be rated as an A.B.
Honourable senators, in this brief review of
what the government regards as a very import-

245

ant bill, I have attempted to outline the
cardinal points of the main amendments. There
are of course a large number of other sections
which I have not seen fit to deal with today,
but which are of a more or less important
nature and which honourable senators will have
an opportunity of discussing in the committee
to which the bill may be referred. The Canada
Shipping Act is a complex measure, and requires a good deal of study in order that one
may become fam.iliar with the many and varied
provisions that constitute the basis of our
maritime law.
In conclusion, I may say that the government has carefully considered the varied and
numerous representations which were made by
organizations interested in the welfare of our
merchant navy and the seamen who man the
ships. I do not think, honourable senators,
that this Act should be changed drastically, as
some would advocate. It is the result of many
years of experience in the operation of m.erchant ships, which are different from any other
kind of transportation. The experience of the
years should not lightly be cast aside if the
shipping industry of this country is to prosper.
The amendments contained -in this bill are
designed to strengthen the industry, and to
help the seamen who go down to the sea in
ships that fly the Canadian flag.
Again, sir, I extend to you my thanks.
Hon. G. P. CAMPBELL: Honourable
senators, I should like to add a few words to
what the honourable minister has said with
respect to this bill. Before doing so, though,
I wish to congratulate him upon the clear
and concise way in which he has reviewed the
bill.
It may interest honourable senators to recall
that the Canada Shipping Act, 1934, is a
product of a committee of this house. Before
the passage of the Statute of Westminster it
was not possible for the Canadian Parliament
to enact its own shipping laws without
approval of the Imperial Parliament. After
the Statute of Westminster was passed a committee was set up in London to study the
shipping question, and later a departmental
committee here drafted a bill, which was
presented to the Senate in 1933. That bill
was referred to the committee on Banking and
Commerce, where some question was raised
as to certain provisions of the bill which
affected British consuls and other officials.
After consideration it was decided that those
provisions were beyond- the powers of the
Parliament of Canada, and the bill was
withdrawn.
The next year. 1934, another bill was
introduced into this house and referred to the
Banking and Commerce Committee, which

SENATE

appointed a subcommittee to give detailed*
consideration to the measure. I may say that
at that time it was regarded as one of the
most important undertakings by any committee of parliament up to that time, and I
do not think any committee has ever had a
more difficult job. The shipping laws of
England were embodied in many statutesabout twenty-five, if I remember correctlythe principal Act being the Merchant Shipping Act of Great Britain. It was the purpose
of the government at that time to attempt
to codify the law, and the result bas been
very satisfactory. The committee in charge
of the bill heard representations from shippers, vessel operators, labour unions and
everyone having any concern with the proposed law.
The committee which undertook this work
just fourteen years ago sat through the Easter
recess. Honourable senators will realize that
even a vacation should not deter the members of this house when there is work to be
done. I had the privilege of representing
some of the Great Lakes interests before the
committee, and I can assure honourable
senators that the work was thoroughly and
completely done. I think that is well evidenced
by the fact that the Canada Shipping Act has
been amended on but two occasions, and in
each instance only slightly.
Shipping legislation is more important today
than it was at the time the Act was passed.
At that time Canada did not have a deep sea
mercantile marine, although we had a few
vessels operating in the coastal trade, and
the Great Lakes fleet, which has been in
existence for a very long time. But today we
have a mercantile marine composed of vessels
recently built by the government and operated
by the Park Steamships during the war. These
vessels have been sold to private interests
now engaged in occan transport, both in the
tramp trade and in regular service between
ports.
Honourable senators will realize that it is
extremely important to Canada to have a
mercantile marine. Canada is now recognized
as a great trading nation, and no trading
nation can exist without her own mercantile
marine.
Probably the best illustration of foresight
in this respect was shown by Germany in the
early part of this century. At that time she
had practically no mercantile marine, and the
extreme importance of having one became
apparent to her. The German government at
that time undertook a program for the building of ships, and in a short while had built
up a sizeable mercantile marine. In Canada,
unfortunately, there are nut the experienced

officers and men that there are in many other
countries.
lie Honouiable Minister of Transport has referred to this fact. and an amendment to the Act is proposed which would
enable steamship inspectors to clear ships
under extreme condi.tions when officers holding
the proper certificates are not available.
Another feature which is confronting the
steamship interests today is the tremendous
power which the unions of this country have
over the operations of ships. As the honourable minister bas said, the shipping laws in
every country have always favoured the seamen. In the passing of the laws of Great
Britain and all other maritime countries,
great care bas been taken to see that adequate
protection is given to seamen. The unions
which now represent the seamen in this
country unfortunately have little respect for
the Canada Shipping Act. Only a few weeks
ago an official of one of the unions told me
that the union did not pay any attention to
the provisions of the Canada Shipping Act. I
think that is rather unfortunate. I am sure it
is not the feeling that exists among the men
who serve on our ships today. It is a fact that
within these unions there are certain elements
which have little respect for the provisions
of the Canada Shipping Act, and even less
respect for the other laws of this country.
It is extremely important at this time that
we should have an Act which is fair and firm,
and which will be strictly administered, as all
laws should be.
As I have said', the shipping industry is
greatly concerned about the attitude of the
unions today. The problem is not one of
rates of pay, hours of work or conditions of
employment, but rather of the attitude of
many of the men serving on Canadian ships,
particularly deep sea vessels. Some have an
utter and complete disregard for the maintenance and proper care of the ship and the
fulfilment of their duty as seamen. That condition eau probably be expected to some
exten t in a new and growing industry of this
kind; but I submit that it is the duty of the
union leaders, who represent the seamen and
are extremely well paid, to try to educate the
men and make them realize that the tradition
established by British seamen should be carried on in Canada.
Shipping in Canada today is carried on
under certain difficulties, but the government
bas donc everything possible to encourage and
develop the industry. While the class of
ships acquired from the Park Steamships are
not the most modern, they were purchased on
favourable terms, with a generous allowance
for depreciation. Everything bas been done
to build up a Canadian mercantile marine.

247

MAB>CH 16, 1948

It is quite impossible, bowever, for the gevernment of any country teo build up an adequate fleet if it does flot get the help and
co-operation of officers and seamen.
The ships acquired by the private interests
operating in Canada were sold subject to the
condition that they be operated under the
Canadian, flag. That, I think, was a proper
condition te impose. It is hoped that during
the course of the next few years Canada may
be able to modernize her fleet, and that some
of those engaged in the shipping trade will be
able t:o build up new tonnage. But it will not
be possible to build new tonnage or to operate
it under the Canadian flag, unless there is
but up a personnel that is willing te serve
as the personnel of British ships serve.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: May I ask the honourable
gentleman if there is any provision in these
amendmnents for overcoming the conditions
which he refers te?
Hon. Mr. CAMPBELL: In answer te the
bonourable leader opposite, I may say that
I tbînk there is adequate provision in the Act
te deal with that situation. 0f course in the
final analysis it cornes clown te the attitude
of the individual aboard his ship. There are
provisions under the Act whereby the master

can discipline his men and deal with situations as they arise; but, unfortunately, as soon
as anyene is disciplined, the leaders of the
unions take issue with the captain and thus
rob him of any power he bas. That is the
un'happy situation at the present time.
I do net find fault with the rnajority of
Canadians who are serving on our sbips today.
There are many officers and men who have a
keen desire te build up the industry. On the
other hand, there are others who are equally
anxious te destroy the industry, who will net
carry their share of the load in serving on
these vessels, and who are backed up in their
attitude by the leaders of the unions te wbich
they belong.
1 mentioned a while ago the rates of pay
received by the men on these vessels. We
often read in the union papers that seamen
are underpaid and overworked, and that tbey
are discrimainatcd against in cemparison witb
workers ashore. Ifhonourable senators will
bear with me for a minute, I will put on the
record a tabulation of' the rates of pay
reported by the National Federation, of
American Shipping, and published on June
23, 1947. It sets eut the wage rates of seamen on the United States east coast, and of
foreign unlicensed personnel.

Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: Is not'the Canadian
Great Lakes scbedule seasonal, and are net
the rates wbich tbe honeurable gentleman bas
given as being applicable te the subnormal
labeur of Europe, referable te year-round
ernployment?
Hlon. Mr. CAMPBELL. Apparently the
honourable member from Toronto-Trinity
(Hon. Mr. Roebuck) did net hear my answer
te the question which was asked by the
bonourable leader of the opposition. I arn

now speaking entirely of deep-sea operatiens,
which provide year-round employment. In
further answer te the honourable senater's
question, in the last union agreement negotiated -witb deep-sea unlicensed personnel there

SENATE

was a provision that the wage was for continuous employment. So far as Great Lakes
operation is concerned. that is an entirely
different matter, and I have left it out. I am
speaking now of the deep-sea, foreign-going
vessels and those engaged in coastal service.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: Is it because of this
differential in rates that some of the ships
which ply the Canadian routes get their men,
including the subnormally paid men of India,
in these other countries to which my honourable friend has referred?
Hon. Mr. CAMPBELL: That is not so.
The men are engaged in Canada; and under
the provisions of the union agreement any
men who in the case of necessity are engaged
elsewhere must be returned whence they came.
I may illustrate this. Recently two men
deserted from the crew of a ship which was
operating to some country to the south,
Mexico I believe. The master signed on two
men whom he found there, and when he
returned the union refused to admit them as
members, and they had to be sent back to
the port where they were recruited. This
happened by reason of the closed-shop agreement, if it may be so termed, with the
unlicensed personnel.
As I have said, the rates of pay which I
have read show that the Canadian rates are
the second highest in the world. Last November, it will be noted, a new agreement was
negotiated which increased the basic rate of
pay of the able-bodied seaman in Canada to
$170, and that of the chief cook to $200; overtime has been increased for the able-bodied
seaman to 80 cents an hour, and for the chief
cook to 90 cents an hour.
As far as the seamen are concerned, the rate
of wage is not an outstanding subject of complaint. To a large extent we follow the pattern
of the United States: when wages increase
there they are almost certain to inercase here.
But we are engaged in a world trade in which
we must compete with ships operating under
the flags of Norway, Sweden, the United Kingdom and other ceountries, where the operating
costs are much lower than in Canada and the
efficiency of the personnel is much higher.
That is a problem we have to face. and I
feel that it is one which must be forcibly
brougbt to the attention of the leaders of
the union.
I am sure that ail who are engaged in the
operation of vessels either on the Great Lakes
of Canada or on the deep sec are in favour of
a high rate of pay; but also they wish to
see efficiency of operation and a willingness
among the individuals concerned to do their
share to help build up in this country an

adequate mercantile marine. If they do net
take that attitude, it will not be very many
years-in fact it may net be many monthsbefore the Canadian mercantile marine will
pass out of existence altogether. I say that
because today there is the keenest competition for freights. Within the last few months
the rates have dropped. Lower rates and the
greater tonnage which is sure to appear on
the oceans will bring keener competition; and
with higher costs it will not be possible for
the operators to replace their present tonnage
with new tonnage or to continue operating
un-der the Canadian flag. It seems to me that
the whole matter is more or less in the
hands of the union, and so long as it persists in
its attitude of the last few years I am not
very hopeful of a good Canadian mercantile
marine.
I feel that most of the amendments to
this bill are improvements to the general law
and bring it pretty much in line with the Merchant Shipping Act of England.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: May I ask the honourable
senator if he coul'd give us in a few words
the history of the United States merchant shipping following the First Great War, especially
in relation to world competition?
Hon. Mr. CAMPBELL: I am not an authority on this subject and would net like to
make a definite statement. I feel, however,
that their operating costs increased to such an
extent that when they were confronted by competition from the United Kingdomr and other
maritime nations, they were unable to continue operating ýtheir sbips. It is a fact, of
course, that the United States pays a subsidy
to make up the difference between the cost of
building ships in that country and building
thema in some other countries. A subsidy is
also paid in respect to operating costs, but J
am net too familiar with theose details.
In conclusion, honourable senators, let me
say that if Canada is to build up its mercantile marine there will have to be closer
co-operation between shipowners, operators,
labour, and government, and until this ceoperation is obtained the industry will be in
constant turmoil.
I am pleased with some of the amendments
made by this bill. I think they improve the
general law and bring it pretty much into line
with the Merchant Shipping Act of the
United Kingdom. I would suggest that when
the bill goes to committee, everyone concerned
should be given an opportunity to discuss the
amendments and the law in general. There
is no doubt that representatives of all parties
vitally interested in the success of this industry would like to be heard. Again I may say

MARCH 16, 1948
that I am sure every senator here is very grateful to the Minister of Transport for explaining
this bill to us; and since we are the fathers
of the present Canada Shipping Act, we should
be able to do a good job on this bill.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: I should like to ask
the minister if the government has given any
consideration to representations made with
respect to qualified radio operators, particularly those on coastal service?
Hon. Mr. CHEVRIER: My recollection is
that the governiment has; and if my memory
serves me correctly, there is no amendment
covering them.
Hon. Mr. GOUIN: I wonder if I might ask
the minister to clarify one matter to which
passing reference has just been made by the
senior senator from Vancouver (Hon. Mr.
Farris). Under the previous Act coastal navigation, or "cabotage" as we say in French, was
not reserved for ships of Canadian registration. Am I to understand that we abide by
the previous system, or has there been any
change made in that respect?
Hon. Mr. CHEVRIER: It is my understanding that the bill does not make any
change.
Hon. J. J. KINLEY: Honourable senators,
I should like to say a word of appreciation
on this, the first occasion on which a minister
has come to the Senate to explain a bill. It
is an innovation that I am sure will bring
good results and increase co-operation between
the two houses of parliament. In the past
they have sought to remain separate. As
honourable senators know, this has been so
to such an extent that we have referred to the
House of Commons as "the other place". I
feel that the time has certainly arrived for
closer co-operation.
I am pleased that the young and talented
Minister of Transport is the first minister
to explain a bill in this house, and I am also
pleased that a bill to amend the Canada
Shipping Act should be the first piece of legislation to come before us in this manner.
The Canada Shipping Act is national in its
scope and international in its aspects. This
bill, therefore, covers matters that are of concern to countries beyond the seas as well as
to our own. We who come from the Maritimes feel that the comradeship of the sea is
the most sincere comradeship of all, and that
seamen are always able to get along well with
their fellowmen. In going to foreign countries
and dealing with people of different nationalities and ideas, shipmasters, shipowners and
ordinary seamen must conform to customs
5853-18j

that do not always meet with their approval.
This serves them well in giving them a better
understanding of others.
I thought that in his peroration the bonourable minister was rather too generous in his
reference to the Canadian merchant marine.
He spoke of men who go down to the sea in
ships that fly the Canadian flag. Unless the
situation has recently changed, it is my
impression there are no Canadian ships. They
are British ships of Canad-ian registry, and I
believe the flag they fly is the British merchant marine flag with, possibly, a maple leaf
on it.

So far as our merchant marine is concernedI say this in a spirit of co-operation
to this honourable chamber-Canada is not
standing on its own feet as it should. I have
in mind the merchant shipping agreement that
was passed concurrently with the Statute
of Westminster. It seems to me that under
that agreement the privileges given to people
outside of Canada were too great. Let us
look at the policy followed by our neighbours
to the south. The United States protect their
nationals in their coastal service, and their
merchant marine is for Americans. It would
appear that the so-called Canadian merchant
marine is too open to competition from
countries with low standards of living. This
situation is unfair, and arises largely from
the fact that the merchant shipping agreement
has been continued. I feel that Canadian seamen, officers and men, should have priority
over all others in our coastal trade.
Hon. Mr. CAMPBELL: May I ask the
honourable senator a question? What does
be refer to particularly when he says that
Canada opens ber shipping trade to all nations?
Hon. Mr. KINLEY: I suppose my honourable friend knows about the merchant shipping
agreement passed concurrently with the Statute
of Westminster.
Hon. Mr. CAMPBELL: Yes, I am familiar
with it.
Hon. Mr. KINLEY: Well, if my honourable
friend would read that he would agree with
what I say.
Hon. Mr. CAMPBELL: I did not understand the statement that we open our coastal
trade to all ships. We open it to British ships.
Hon. Mr. KINLEY: And also to ships o]
countries with which Britain has certain agreements. If the honourable senator would read
the last paragraph of the merchant shipping
agreement he would see that that is so.
Hon. Mr. CAMPBELL: It is a reciprocal
arrangement.

SE'NATE,

Hon. Mr. KINLEY: Yes, with Great Britian
and other countries. For instance we find their
Ehips carrying coal to Montreal, and as far
mnland as ports on the Great Lakes.
Hon. Mr. CAMPBELL: My henourablo
friend surely knows that that is net coastieg.
United States ships are not permitted to coast
in Canada.
Hon. Mr. KINLEY: I know. but under the
British merchant shipping agreement, European
ships are allowed te, do coasting in Canada.
Hon. Mr. CAMPBELL: No, thev cannot.
'Ton. Mr. KJNLEY: I differ with my honourable frjen(I, notwithstanding that he is a
legal authority.
Hon. Mr. DUFF: You arc quito riglt.
Hon. Mr. KINLEY: Another thing that
occurs te me as being detrimental to our
merchant marine is thiat it is interiocked with
the Canadian National Raiiways. After the
First Great W/ar, whcn the Canadian National
Railways were running into deficits and wantod
te dispose of a.sscts that would hring in cash,
they found that they could seli thoir ships.
In our missionary efforts to build up trade
abroaýd wc nscd those ships ail over the world
for ycars at a deficit; but as scion as they
began to pay a profit thcv werc sold at very
low prices to foreign counitries.
Lot us not forget, honourable sonators, that
if wc want to build up a great oxport trado, we
should control the carrying of our own goods.
A shipping ring in another country could do
great barrm by discriminatorv freight rates. 1
said at the time of the sale of the ships that it
was a bad thing, and that dlaima has bcen
justified by resuits. The directorate of the
Canadian National Raiiways is not marineminded. The business -of the directors is to
run a railroad. Lt seems to, me that if we are
to have a successful morchant marine it should
U- -rý-.olled
by men who want to se it
succced against ail other forms of transportation.
I have heard people say. that the
Canadian National Steamship Services shouid
be handcd over to private cntcrprise, because
then the ships owned by tlîis country would
receive business froin our tw'o groat railroads
instead of from the Canadian National oniv, as
now. Honourabie members eau weii sec that
fremn this point cf view it weuld be a good
thing if the Canadian National steaimships
wcre divorced frem the Canadian National
Raiiways.
W/hile on the subject of Canadian ships 1
might point eut that the Canadian Pacifie
oerates a great steamýzli;p company. But it is
not a Cainadian company; it is a British
company.

The biih providos for appointment of shipping masters. I may say that in the smiailer

The minister referred te an amendmcent te
facilitato compensation when a soaman suffers
a fatal accident. Yoars ago I had a grcat
deal te do with making compensation available te fish',rmen. There was a lot of oppo..itien te that, for it 'vas said that fishermn-î,
operatcd on shares and thoreforo werc net
entitled te ho made beneficiaries of legýis]ation
of that kind. As I recaîl the arrangement

MARCH 16, 194
that we put into, effect, a searnan was coinpensated for injuries received ini an accident,
without regard to, who was at fault, and in
return hie surrendered his common law rights
to institute an action. I believe that for this
purp ose the machinery of the provincial workmen's compensation board was used. I muet
point' out to the minister that the innovation
provided for in this bill rnight lead to litigation, which would be a bad t.bing.
Hon. Mr. CHEVRIER: Mr. Speaker, may
I be alîlowed to interrupt the honourable
senator?
Hon. Mr. KINLEY: Yes.
Hon. Mr. CHEVRIER: I wish to point out
that this bill has nothing to do with compensation for merchant seamen. It introduces into
the Act a new part dealing with fatal accidents. Compensation for merchant seamen was
provided for in an Act passed last session.
Hon. Mr. KINLEY: This bill would flot
affect a seaman'.- rights to compensation for
injury?
Hon. Mr. CHEVRIER: Not in the slightest.
Hon. Mr. KINLEY: This provides additional means of securing compensation?
Hon. Mr. CHEVRIER: Yes.
Hon. Mr. KINLEY: That is ail right.
The minister referred to an amendaient
which. requires that yachts carrying passengers
must have certificated officers. There should
be some statement as to the minimum size of
yacht affected by this amendment. You would
not expect a man sailing a yacht of forty or
fifty feet to have the same certificate as a
master of a sailing vessel in Nova Scotia or
on the Great Lakes. A certificated captain
should certainly be required on.ly on yachts
that -are registered.
Another thing that the minister said was
that we are now ta have certiflcated cooks.
I neyer heard searnen complain about their
cooks, though I have often heard complainte
about the grub.
Hon. Mr. DUFF: The seamen want oleornargarine.
Hon. Mr. KINLEY: I would rather sec
them able ta eat butter.
I frankly tell the ministier that during my
parliarnentary career it has been my experience
that the law always went faster than educational facilities. During the years of the war
the government established three or four
splendid schools in Nova Scotia, ta educate
merchant seamen. They were good schools,
the merchant searnen were educated and their

progress towards; becoming officers was speeded
up. But I want to teld the hanourable minister
that the Canada Shipping Act, for sorne years
after it was in-voked, worked hardship on
practical seamen. I recall once I gat special
permission and we passed fifty men in one
day at Lunenburg. I got an inspector ta corne
to 'Lunenburg and fifty captains with experience were passed in one day.
Hon. Mr. DUFF: Including one woman.
Hon. Mr. KINLEY: Following the sea, is
a hazardous business. Men who have otber
opportunities usually do not go to sea, because
they know what is before them. These men
do not get a complete education because, as
a ruhe, they corne from poor families and
have no opportunity ta go beyond the eighth
or ninth grade. They get their practical experience upon the sea, and with that experience
they become competent ships' masters; and
operate their ships efficiently. Then they
corne up against the Canada Shipping Act, and
find that under the provisions of the Act
they have to give way Vo somebody who
cornes ahong with a nice certificate. The
experienced seamen have ta go on the beach
while the other fehlows take their jobs. They
do not like that at ahI. We in the Maritimes
feel that adequate educational facilities for
seamen should be provided. True, we have
our navy cadet corps, which are of some
value in teaching our boys about the sea and
seafaring, but we shouhd have some facilities
for teaching the young people that the sea,
is a noble profession and noV an occupation
pursued only by those who have no other
opportunities.
I believe that if we get aur seamen started
right wc will not have the spectacle of officers
of the inerchant marine striking for higher
pay. It seems to me that men who have
been certified by the Government of Canada
to be efficient in their work should find sorne
better way to settle the differences bctween
themsehves and the ship owners. I arn alI for
the searnen getting as much pay as they can,
and I do noV Vhink they are overpaid. True,
during the war years the seamen did get big
pay; but they deserved it. The merchant
marine was a profitable business then, and no
one hast much money ini it. With the hazards
they have to face, seamen deserve big pay.
They also deserve ta go up in rank. In this
way better men will be attracted ta the
service.
It does seem to me that the amendments to the Shippîng Act should be considered noV only on the basis of its administration by headquar Vers at Ottawa. That is
always the way these things work: public

SENATE

officials want to put a blanket over the operations and control the men by means of legislation. I am concerned about seeing that
the administration at Ottawa has effective
legislation; but I am more concerned about
preserving the liberties of the men who go to
sea. They must always have a fighting chance
if they get into any trouble.
The honourable senator from Lunenburg
(Hon. Mr. Duff) and myself live among seamen and fishermen, and we know some of their
problems. My father was a fisherman and a
sea captain. We were a family of ten. Early
in my youth I learned about the problems
of seamen, and I have never forgotten. The
strength of this country largely depends on
the strength of the men who bear the burdens
in the lower strata of our endeavours; and
the men who have gone to sea from the Maritime Provinces have done noble service.
When the legislation affecting veterans was
brought in J was very sorry to see that a man
who spent most of his life upon the sea could
net even qualify for the job of light-keeper or
shipping master, or for a port job that naturally ought to go to a man of marine experience.
I do hope the honourable minister will sec
to it that when a civil service vacancy oecurs
which requires the qualifications of a seafaring man, legislation will not be pa--sed to
prevent him froin taking the job just because
he is net regarded as part of the fighting services of this country, despite the fact that the
minister referred to the merchant marine as
the "Merchant Navy".
All these things must be taken into account,
and when this bill is in committee J hope it
will receive the generous and full consideiation
that was given te the original Act. I hope also
that we will see to it that we legislate for the
people, and not just for the purpose of making
it easy to control an industry such as shipping,
wbich is so important and valuable te this
country.
Hon. VINCENT DUPUIS (Translation):
Honourable senators, I do not intend te hold
forth at any length on this bill. I would like to
make a few remarks in connection with the
discussion which the honourable Minister of
Transport was kind enough to initiate in this
house and for which he is, as far as I am
concerned, to be heartily congratulated?
Let me say first of all that when I was a
member of the other house I sat on a committee known as the War Expenditure Conmittee. and in the course of our consideration
of various matters, we often had the oppor-

tunity of calling people with a great deal of
seafaring experience. Many of the members
on this committee became interested in
the possibility of promoting in the future,
after the war-we were still in wartime thena Canadian shipping industry able to provide
transportation facilities for our exports.i
An Act wa-s enacted in 1934-I was at that
time a member of the other House-a most
important Act which we shalH undertake to
amend. Our merchant navy cannot compete
with the merchant navies of other countries,
particularly the European navies.
With all the respect due to the authorities
concerned-in this instance, the Canadian
Government-I would suggest what seems to
me as being of primary importance in regard
to the future of my country, in which we have
hope.
Our government should encourage,
even by means of subsidies, shipbuilding in
Canada as well as the building of numerous
dry-docks from which we would launch a
merchant navy efficient enough to ensure our
independence of other navies in regard to
our international trade. I take this opportunity to submit this suggestion and I hope it
will be accepited.
I would like now to touch upon a matter
of minor importance. I would suggest to our
Honourable Minister of Transport, when the
time comes to consolidate the Act as it stands
now and which is presently before us, that
he make arrangements te have the Canadian
Shipping Act consolidated in a separate volume.
In 1934, the government, or the King's Printer,
committed a serious mistake when the Canadian Shipping Act was inserted in the 1934
Statutes, a book containing 1,500 pages. The
Shipping Act which it is now the intention to
amend covers nearly 500 pages. I believe that
in making my suggestion I express the wishes
of all the lawyers and judges of Canada.
Hon. L. M. GOUIN: Honourable senators,
first of all I wish to sincerely congratulate the
Minister of Transport on his clear and illuminating presentation of the bill which is now
under discussion. For many reasons I rejoice
and am legitimately proud that the distinguished gentleman who occupies the portfolio
of Minister of Transport is the first minister
from the other place to appear in this venerable house.
Referring again to coastal shipping, although
net in connection with the point which I mentioned a few minutes ago, I wish to lay before
the minister an observation which I hope will

MARCH 16, 1948

be regarded as of a constructive nature. I
believe that everybody, and in particular our
dear colleague from Queens-Lunenburg (Hon.
Mr. Kinley), will admit that shipbuilding is
the oldest-established industry in Canada, particularly in those parts which were formerly
known as New France and Acadia, where, in
the olden time, we used to reserve for the
ships of the king-les vaisseaux du roi-our
royal oaks and our cedars. If I speak with
enthusiasm about our good old ships, it is
because, when young, I used to spend the
summers on steamers-incidentally, very small
ories-plying down the lower St. Lawrence and
along the coast of Labrador and invariably
coaling, by the way, at Sydney, Cape Breton.
I think those were the happiest days of my
life. I have always continued to love ships,
remembering, for instance the type of ship
which is called in English a man-of-war. For
me it is something much more than mere wood
or steel, it is a living creature; and I believe
that anyone who bas in his veins the blood of
Brittany or the sister land of Wales, or of Scotland, Ireland, or any part of England, would
have the same feeling. For u the slip is a
cherished treasure, a part of our very being.
Hon. Mr. LEGER: "It" is a "she".
Hon. Mr. GOUIN: During the last war it
was my privilege to spend a few days with
our Royal Canadian Navy. I shall always
remember with great emotion those days,
which happened to be during a very difficult
period of time. Also in 1943 I was chosen as
chairman of a Royal Commission ta investigate a certain number of shipyards in Quebec
and Ontario. I mention that circumstance
because some shipyards which had been
exceedingly active during the war of 1914-18
were afterwards completely abandoned, and
I saw growing in the yards at Midland, Collingwood and elsewhere, not only grass and
bush, but big trees. May I suggest to the
minister that under the difficult circumstances
which now hang over us, when the clouds are
becoming darker and darker not only from day
to day, but from hour to hour, it is of real
importance that we make sure that our shipyards are not again abandoned and allowed to
disappear during periods of transition.
I know that just now some of our shipyards
have received very substantial orders from
South American countries, and also from
France and Holland,, for the building of ships.
But the day will corne when shipyards in other
countries will be competing with ours, and I
am concerned with the possibility that, for
various reasons, our own industry will then
be upon a footing of inferiority. At the beginning of this sitting the honourable senator

253

from Toronto (Hon. Mr. Campbell) pointed
to the fact that our standard of living is, after
that of the United States, the highest in the
world, and that consequently it costs much
more to operate a Canadian ship than to
operate a ship belonging to some other nation.
I have already mentioned the question of our
coastal shipping trade. I do not want to
embarrass the minister; I am not asking any
questions: I merely call his attention to the
fact that the time bas come to study, and
study seriously, the matter of reserving that
trade to ships of Canadian registry. I say
that, of course, without any trace of prejudice
against any other interest; but I believe it is
important not only for Canada but for the
Commonwealth, and even for the whole democratic world, to make absolutely sure that our
shipyards are kept alive.
Hon. ARTHUR W. ROEBUCK: I wish to
join with all those who have spoken in extending congratulations to my friend and former
colleague in the House of Commons, who has
climbed to a high peak of eminence in that
assembly and now comes here as the first
minister of the Crown to pass the bar of the
Senate. Honourable senators will remember
that I was opposed to the change which has
given rise to his attendance, but only on the
ground that it violated what I thought was
the long-term wisdom of the principles
involved. But that is past; we settled the
rule; and the honourable gentleman comes
here with the very warmest welcome which
we can extend to him. I wish also to congratulate him on the ability with which he
described the bill and gave us a bird's-eye view
of its provisions.
It was not my intention to discuss the bill,
because I am not prepared to do so. Rather,
I await the explanation. But I am impelled
to say a word because I was, I confess,
just a little disturbed by some of the remarks made by the honourable senator from
Toronto (Hon. Mr. Campbell). On thinking
it over I felt that perhaps I should not be
disturbed, because that would be only his
natural viewpoint. In the first and historia
strike which took place upon the Great Lakes,
when the .present union was recognized for the
first time by the owners, and when it secured
for the men who worked on the ships of our
Great Lakes not only reduced hours and
increased wages, but also that self-respect
which comes to men when they assert and
establish that they are not mere chattels in
the hands of bosses, the honourable gentleman,
represented the ship owners, as their solicitor,
and I represented the men. Therefore he sees
this matter from the employers' standpoint

SENATE

while I sec it from the other angle. I accord
him the right to express his viewpoint, and
he will no doubt accord me the right to
express mine.
Both the honourable minister and the senator from Toronto referred to seamen as a
specially favoured class. It is truc that no
class of workers are protected by statutory law
as much as the men who work on ships, but
I would point out to my fellow senators that
this is so only because legislators found it
necessary to curb the dominating brutality of
shipmasters over the men who were temporarily within their power. Men aboard these
floating hells that sailed our seas were regarded
as mere chattels, and were treated terribly and
paid the lowest wages of almost any class of
labour-scarcely enough to enable them to
exist. If today the schedule of wages of the
Canadian seamen is as high as the honourable
senator from Toronto has stated, it is because
the labour unions-which, as you like, can be
credited or blamed-at considerable cost to
themselves asserted their rights and finally
achieved a decent standard of living on the
seas. Seamen were the worst-treated labourers
in the entire world, and I for one rejoice if the
facts presented by the honourable senator from
Toronto are correct.
I am all for the seamen, and I do not think
that any great sympathy should be felt for the
employers. Not long ago I read in the newspapers about a Great Lakes shipmaster who in
a short period of time achieved the status of
a millionaire. It would not be difficult for me
to name a number of individuals who rose
from small beginnings to positions of great
wealth. But I do net think any credit should
go to the owners of the shipping industry if
the seamen have achieved a standard of living
that is not below that of other labourers.
My honourable friend from Toronto bas
referred to what he called the utter disregard
and flouting of law by the labour unions. I am
net going to bandy words with him or anyone
else about the character of either of the contending parties, but in passing I cannot help
remarking that the flouting of law and the disregard of rules of order are not all chargeable te the men. If I were put to it, I think
I could tell of some flouting of the law on the
part of the people whom the honourable
senator from Toronto (Hon. Mr. Campbell)
represented in the contest to which I have
referred.
Honourable senators, I should like te compliment the honourable senator from QueensLunenburg (Hon. Mr. Kinley) on bis very
eloquent, capable and humane speech. I congratulate him on his knowledge of this subject, which has grown with him since childhood. He knows what he is talking about

far better than either the senator from Toronto
or the senator from Toronto-Trinity. We
from Toronto have lived inland while the
honourable senator from Queens-Lunenburg
has lived all his life by the sea. I agree with
him when ho says that Canadian companies
have put their ships under British registry
in order that they might hire men from the
Orient and other countries where wages are
low. They have donc this, of course, so that
they may escape the higher schedule of wages
and avoid providing the better standard of
living maintained in this country. It is net
creditable to them, but I suppose that competition drives men to do things they might
net otherwise do.
This brings me to a remark made by the
honourable senator from De Salaberry (Hon.
Mr. Gouin) about the possibility of our shipyards closing in the event of competition. I
do not know whether I have exactly interpreted his irmark or net, but I believe it was
to that effect. While I have every sympathy
for the Maritime shipowners, the Maritime
shipbuilding industry and those who sell
ships, I should like to say to my honourable
fri.end from De Salaberry that the sale and
management of ships on the higb seas comes
under the conditions of free trade; you cannot, by a Canadian tariff, protect a ship or
increase its price when it is sold on the world
mark-et. When ships leave Canadian ports and
compete in ocean trade they come under free
trade conditions, but .when chi.ps are bought,
sold or managed in this country, they are
subject to the increased costs of the Canadian
tariff. My honourable friend from QueensLunenburg (Hon. Mr. Kinley) very recently
said that he was in favour of the tariff when
it helped him and was opposed to itHon. Mr. KINLEY: Oh, no.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: Well, pretty close to
it. I accept your objection. But here, honourable members, you have a situation where
the shipping industry of the Maritime Provinces is at a disadvantage and gains no
advantage from the tariff. 'It is perhaps more
than anything else the unfair conditions arising
from the presence of a tariff that make it so
difficult, if net impossible, to operate ships
on the sea from our maritime ports.
I congratulate my honourable friend the
Minister of Transport and extend te him an
invitation to speak here whenever he has
important legislation to introduce.
Hon. Mr. HOWARD moved the adjournment of the debate.
The motion was agreed to.
The Senate adjourned until tomorrow at

THE LATE SENATOR MO.LLOY
TRIBUTES TO HIS MEMORY

Hon.

WISHART

MeL.

ROBERTSON:

Honourable senators, before the business of
the bouse is proceeded with I should like to
make a brief reference to the passing of our
late esteemed colicague, Senator Molloy, of
which we learned yesterday.
Senator Molloy was born on Mardi 13, 1873,
at Arthur, Ontario, the son of Irish Canadian
parents. H1e received his education at the
Emerson Publie Sehool, the Ontario Veterinary College and the MeKillop Veterinary
College of Chicago.
In 1903 hie married
Frances Helen Keeley, and they had a family
of five chiîdren.
The late Senator Molloy first entered politics in 1907, as candidate in the provincial
election in Manitoba. H1e was defeated in
that election, but in the general election of
19118 was elected to the House of Comnmons,
and was re-eiected in 1911 and again in 1917.
The late senator was defeated in the election
of 1921, and was summoned to the Senate on
October 6, 1925.
In private life Senator Molloy was a vetermnary surgeon, and an active member of the
Knights of Columbus. H1e passed away on
Mardi 16, 1948, after a severe ilîness.
Our late colleague was a man witli a wide
knowledge of public affairs, and for almost
forty yc.ars was a member of one or other of
the two branches of parliament. He was a
faitiful attendant at the sittings of the Senate
and of its committees, in whicli lie frequently
took an important part. His charming per-

255

sonality and genial manner endeared him to,
ail, and hie will long be rem-embered in the
halls of parliament, wliere for many years lie
was a familiar figure.
Hon. JOHN T. HAIG: Honourable members, I do not propose to refer to the life
history of the late Senator Molloy, who lias
been known to me since -the provincial election
of February, 1907. At that time lie was a
candidate for the constituency of Morris,
Manitoba, and the senior partner of the firîn
I worked for was the candidate on the other
side. As a young fellow I liad a little to do
with arranging meetings, and thereby got to
know Senator Molloy. An interesting point
about that election was that the late eenator
was defeated at the poils by two votes; on a
recount the vote was a tie, and the returning
officer cast bis ballot for tbe candidate of the
government of that day.
I knew Senator Molloy intimately as a Manitoban. H1e was well known in our province,
and was a pioneer among veterinarians. 11e
was a bonny figliter, a cheerful loser, and a
good winner, and will long be remembered as
an outstanding member of the Parliament of
Canada representing the province of Manitoba.
I know some but not aIl of the late senator's
family. About a year and a haîf ago his wife
passcd away. His son is a distinguisbed member of the Manitoba bar, and is well known in
legal circles in the city of Winnipeg.
Our late friend will be greatly missed by
the people of Manitoba. There wa-s neyer any
doubt where hie stood on a question, wliether
political, legal or medical. He was clear, in lis
ideas and positive in bis convictions. I am sure
1 express the feelings of the people of my
province wben I say that hie was a cliaracteristic citizen of Manitoba, and tliat lie gave
real representation to that province in the
Bouse of Gommons, and later in this chamber.
I extend sympathy on behaîf of this side of
tie house to his son and his daugliters in the
sad bereavement tliey have suffered in the
passing of their father.
Hon. T. A. CRERAR: Almost tliree tliousand years ago, amid the hilîs and valleys of
Judea, the Psalmist gave expression in words
of rare beauty and insighit to the thouglit
that is uppermost in our minds at this
moment:
As for man, his dýays are as grass: as a fiower
of the field, so he flourisheth.
For the wind passeth over it, and it is gone;
and the place thereof shaîl know it no more.
A few montis ago our colleague was with
us engaged in the work of this house. Now

SENATE

he has passed on; the wind bas passed over
him, and this place here shall know him no
more.
It is almost fifty years since my first
acquaintanceship with our late colleague, "Jack"
Molloy-the name by which he was more
familiarly known throughout Manitoba than
any other. He was a man of strong convictions and at all times had the courage of his
convictions. As the leader of the opposition
(Hon. Mr. Haig) has said, "he was a bonny
fighter" when it came to a political scrap, and
he neither asked nor gave quarter; but when
the contest was over, he was the first man to
come along and shake hands, and everything
was as it had been before.
His contribution in his own community in
a professional way was outstanding. His contribution to the work of parliament, in both
branches of which he sat at different times, was
a worthwhile contribution. He was a fine
family man, and was esteemed in his neighbourhood. He had many of the virtues that
we associate with good, decent citizenship. In
tîat respect lie was like countless thousands of
others who in their day and generation make
their contribution to the welfare of their community and their country.
We shall miss him. I know I shall miss him.
But after all, his passing is in the nature of
things. His spirit was, in a way, a gay spirit.
Very few of us knew a year ago when he was
at his place in this chamber taking part in our
discussions-at any rate I did not knowthat he was fighting the dread disease which
finally dragged him down. But there was
never a word of complaint. He had at that
time a' confidence, which unfortunately proved
to be misplaced, that he was going te win out
in the struggle that he was carrying on. That
attitude reflects the nature of the man.
As I said a moment ago, we shall miss him,
but, as in the case of many others who have
passed away from our midst, and whom we
mourn, we shall at all times have the memory
of his presence with us-and that shall remain
with me as long as I live.
Hon. A. L. BEAUBIEN: Honourable senators, two weeks ago yesterday I went to sec
the late senator in the Misericordia Hospital
at Winnipeg. At that time he was very ill,
but there was still some hope that he would
overcome the disease which had struck him.
On Monday of this week I received a letter
from his daughter telling me that ber father's
condition had somewhat improved, so you can
appreciate how shocked I was yesterday to
receive a telegram from bis son telling me of
his father's death. Senator Molloy was stricken
by a terrible disease that shows no mercy

and about which medical science knows little.
It was only about a year ago that Senator
Molloy lost his beloved wife through a similar
ailment. Senator Molloy possessed a fighting
spirit and the will to live, but that is net
enough to overcome such a merciless disease,
especially when it strikes a vital part.
The late senator was a Liberal through and
through, and he never hesitated to express his
political feelings in or out of season. In 1907,
when he ran for the county of Morris in the
provincial elections of Manitoba, he was
opposed by a man who had been entrenched
in that constituency for many years, the Honourable Colin Campbell, Attorney-General of
the province. According to all reports, Senator
Molloy had defeated the Honourable Mr.
Campbell; but the deciding vote had te bo cast
by the returning officer appointed by the government of the day.
Many years ago in bis profession as a veterinary surgeon, the late senator made a splendid
contribution te publie welfare during an epidemie of distemper among the horse population of Manitoba. He went around the farms
testing the horses, and it was net a pleasant
task for him to have te tell a farmer that his
horses must be destroyed. Nevertheless he
performed his duty faithfully and fearlessly.
In the Dominion elections of 1908 he was
returned for the county of Provencher, and
represented that constituency until 1921.
Senator Molloy was a man who loved his
home and family. I am intimately acquainted
with all his children, his daughters having
attended sehool with my daughters. I do not
think there ever was a finer father than the
late senator, and to his children I extend my
deepest sympathy in their loss of a wonderful
father by such a terrible disease.
Hon. L. M. GOUIN: Honourable senators,
by sad coincidence it is on St. Patrick's day
that I rise to pay tribute to a distinguished
Canadian of Irish descent, our former colleague from Manitoba, who bas just left us for
the great beyond. Senator Molloy was always
so kind and friendly towards me that I feel his
death as a personal loss. May I mention a
simple instance in my personal experience as
an example of his sincere kindness of heart. I
think it was in October six years ago that
I arrived by train in Winnipeg very early one
morning and was welcomed at the station by
the honourable leader of the opposition (Hon.
Mr. Haig) and the late Senator Molloy. That
was indeed a charming gesture of friendship,
and it will always remain for me one of the
most cherished memories of my life.

ATTACKS ON PUBLIC MEN
DISCUSSION

Hon. J. W. De B. FARRIS rose in accordance with the following notice:
That he wihl call the attention of the Senate
that some men in publie positions and others
and some newspapers are making unjustifiable
attacks on the integrity of men in high office in
a manner inimical to the good government of
Canada and tending to give encouragement to
the subversive elements in the land.

He said: Honourable senators, according
to our rules the notice of inquiry which I gave,
and which appears on the order paper, entitles
me to discuss the question therein mentioned.
For some time certain things that have been
happening and certain items that have been
appearing in the newspapers have impressed
me with the need for some reference to these
matters. At first my ideas were somewhat
indefinite, but they came to a head when I
read an editorial in the Toronto Globe and
Mail of last Friday. I find myself in this
embarrassing position.
When I gave this
notice I had in mind a somewhat restricted
discussion of the question referred to in the
notice, but the editorials and comments that
have been appearing in the paper in the last
two or three days have rather enlarged the
scope of what one must say. Besides, I have
been almost inundated with information; so,
honourable senators, if you find me wandering along at some length so that you begin to
watch the clock, I hope you will make due
allowance. I promise you this: I am going
home tomorrow and there will not be another
speech by me very soon.
I think at all times it is regrettable that
attacks are made reflecting on the integrity of
men in public positions, and I want to suggest
for your thoughtful consideration this afternoon, and I hope I can keep this discussion
on a high plane, that in times such as we are
going through these attacks are more serious
than usually is the case.
These are not
normal times, honourable senators. We have
had two of the most destructive wars that
there have ever been in the history of the
world. The last one, in particular, was a
total war in which not merely armies but all
the people of all the nations concerned were
fighting. There is no question that war is a
brutalizing thing, and to my mind there is no
question that the continuous brutality to
which we have to steel ourselves in wartime
has a weakening effect on the moral fibre of
individuals and of society as a whole. I do
not think that I am beyond the mark when I
say that we are conscious that our stalwart
characteristics and self-reliance are not as
they were in the days of our fathers. Our
deep-rooted. convictions are not those of our
fathers. I do not think there is the general
regard for religion that our fathers had.
Hon. Mr. DUFF: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: In these modern days
there is not the respect that we should like
to see for constituted authority. There is net
the sense of individual responsibility to the

SENATE

state that used to characterize the people of
this country and the people of the countries
whence our ancestors came.
Not only is that so, but as an inevitable
consequence we are more susceptible to outside
influences than we were under normal conditions. The result has been twofold. First,
there are more subversive influences and more
subversive groups in the community than
there ever were before in our history; and in
the second place, those subversive influences
and those subversive groups in the community
find it casier to get inside our guard and
weaken our resistance than they would under
normal conditions. I am thinking, in the first
place, of communism. Anybody who listened
to the radio today is probably thinking of it
more than ordinarily. I notice how busy our
frien.ds of the C.C.F. have been in recent
weeks to deny any connection or association
with the communist movement.
Hon. Mr. DUFF: Too late.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: Well, I would not say
that. There is always hope. But I do say
this-and if the matter were not so serious
I would take a little satisfaction out of itthat just at this time some chickens are coming
home to roost with the C.C.F. party.
Hon. Mr. DUFF: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: I am not making any
attack on the leader of the C.C.F. in another
place, but I do say that that party has not
built up its present strength in Canada merely
by teaching the doctrines of socialism. I speak
with a direct knowledge of conditions in British
Columbia, and I believe that what is true of
conditions there is true elsewhere, namely, that
in that party's earlier days in particular, its
strength was built up by an organized and
persistent campaign of appealing to what its
spokesmen called the under-dog, with a view
to stirring up envy against their more successful neighbours and trying to instil into the
hearts of men the feeling that the person who
had succeeded in this country of ours should
apologize for the fact that he was a little
beter off than someone else in wordly possessions. As a result there has been growing
up in some quarters of this country a feeling
that ability leading to success, instead of being
an indication of the great opportunities in
Canada and of the individual capacities in our
citizens, is something that ought to be levelled
down. If our friends of the C.C.F. party deny
that they have climbed up on that ladder, I
dispute the fact. I do not need to prove it,
because we all know it.
So far as the communist party is concerned,
honourable senators, I make no appeal to

them to co-operate with us in resisting the
evils that exist. Their allegiance is not to
Canada, andr
my only reaction would be to
stamp them out. As to the C.C.F. party,
there are various groups in its membership.
The left wingers of that party are pretty hard
to distinguish from members of the communist party, and I have no more regard for them
than I have for Tim Buck.
But there is hope of regeneration in the
repudiation that is going on today. I have
no doubt that if the C.C F. party goes far
enough and persists long enough in its repudiation, it may undo some of the harm that has
already been done to the morale of this
country and to the spirit of free co-operation
that should exist between citizens in this
great land of opportunity.
Conditions being what they are in Canada
today, there never was a time when it was
more necesary to build up confidence and
respect for constituted authority-for the
judiciary and even for our politicians. However contemptuously some people may use the
term "politician", he is the man who is
entrusted with the government of our country.
The conditions necessary for our welfare and
preservation in Canada today can never be
maintained if the men who hold the highest
offices, judicial and political, are traduced and
discredited in the popular mind.
Now, honourable senators, I wish to look at
this question in two ways. First, I should
like to consider the question of unity in
Canada. We have two great races in this
country, the French and, the English.
Hon. Mr. MacLENNAN: We have threethe Scotch.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: I had forgotten about
them, but being for the most part Scotch
myseIf, although my name does not entirely
indicate it, I am willing to have them identified with the body which I shall refer ta as
British, rather than English.
One of the basic essentials in this country
if we are to survive as a nation-and I am
talking about Canada as a nation-is unity
between the French and the British. What
does that unity d.epend on? Certainly not
on the speeches that you and I may make. I
believ'e that it depends on understanding,
mutual trust and confidence between the two
races. Any man who distorts that understanding or who deliberately seeks to destroy it,
whether he be in public life or private life,
or any member of a religious denomination
who seeks to set one religious denomination
against another, is doing a dýisservice to the
people of Canada.

MARCH 17, 1948
In the first place I wisli to cali to the attention of honourable senators something which
I arn perhaps more free to refer to than
Mnost anyone else in this chamber. That is
the fulminations of a so-called religious publication ini Toronto, recording the extravagant
and un-Christian utterances of a so-called
"Baptist preacher" in that city. I happen to
be a Baptist-I do not know that I could
be called a good Baptist-but I arn pleased
to say that this gentleman about whom I arn
talking lias not for a number of years been a
member of the Baptist Convention of Ontario
and Quebec. I do flot wish to go into a lot
of detail on this matter because I would not
honour the things he says by putting them on
the record here.
Hon. Mr. MacLENNAN: Put them in the
garbage can. That is where he ougbt to be.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: The trouble is that lie
would not stay there. I arn making these
remarks not because I am very much concerned about the harm this man does in
Toronto, where I believe lie i-s known and
accepted for what he is, but because I arn
concerned about the harmful effeet of lis
statements when repeated in the province of
Quebec, where the good citizens are apt to
be influenced by them to a far greater extent
than are the people in the community in
which lie is a detractor. I pick out that
instance as an extreme illustration of intolerant
Protestantism in a province outside of Quebea.
Now, as to the province of Quebec, I
Approach the discussion with some hesitation.
I think there are some -things which we eau
say to our fellow-citizens in that province
about what they ought to know of tlie attitude
of the people in the rest of Canada and their
desire for friendly association with that
province.
In speaking about the premier of the province of Quebec, 1 have no intention of making personal attacks on any individual, thougli
there may be one exception later on. But
charges and insinuations have been made
against a great French Canadian, the Honourable Louis St. Laurent, whomn every member
of this house honours and respects. He is one
of the heirs apparent of Mr. Mackcnzie King.
The Liberal party is so strong in leaders that
there are many to choose from, but certainly
Mr. St. Laurent is the one I would vote for
as the Prime Minister's successor.
Within the past few days, honourable senators, charges have been made against Mr.
St. Laurent on two occasions. One occasion was
prior to Mr. St. Laurent's speech in reply, and
the other was after he had spoken in the

House of Commons on Mardi 4 last. I have
before me a copy of a 'paper publisbed in
Quebec in the Frenchi language. Perhaps witb
the use of a dictionary I could have made a
translation of it; but one of my Frenchi
colleagues was kind enougli to translate it
for me, and I feel more secure in accepting
his version. Here is what it says:
Mr. St. Laurent believes that it was bis duty
to collaborate with the representative of the
communist regime in Poland in coonection with
tbe Polish treasures.
He seems to bie of the opinion that bis us-ingthe Mounted Police in sucb occurrence was
appropriate and proper.
Jo so f ar as we are concerned we think that
such proceeding adopted by the Ministry for
External Affairs under the direction of Mr.
St. Laurent, and the Mounted Police, is intolerala and dcfinitaly unbecoming.

On March 4, after certain allegations liad
been made, Mr. St. Laurent gave a full statement in the House of Commons. 1 had the
pleasure of listening to it from a seat in tlie
senators' gallery. It explains exactly wbat
happened. Treasures of art had been brouglit
to Canada from Poland at a time wben, I
believe, a provisional government was operat-

ing out.side that country, and that goverfiment asked the Canadian government to store

becomes the leader of the opposition in this
Senate, where we seldom strictly follow the
rules, to make such uncalled-for remarks.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: On a question of privilege: The honourable senator from Vancouver
South (Hon. Mr. Farris) has no right to refer
in this fashion to the leader of the opposition. All I did was to raise a point of order;
and I do not think-well., I will say afterwards what I have to say.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: My honourable friend
stops with the words "I do not think". We
will let it go at that.
The Hon. The SPEAKER: The debate concerns a matter of common knowledge, which
has been reported in the press, and the reference to Hansard is, I think, quite justified.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: The only reason I referred to this record was that I was not sure of
the place where these articles were stored.
I notice that they were placed in a building
at the Central Experimental Farm.
Subsequently there occurred a change of
government in Poland. In due course, as a
matter of proper international convention, that
government was recognized by Canada, as well
as by other countries. Its complexion may
be communist, but what difference does that
make so far as this question is concerned?
The new government of Poland represented
to the dominion authorities, in whose premises
these goods had been stored, although the
government had taken no responsibility for
them, that they had disappeared, and asked
the government to give assistance in locating
them. Finally it was suggested that they were
in a certain place in Quebec. Two FrenchCanadian officers of the Mounted Police
visited that place, and the mother superior,
upon being asked about the possession of those
works of art, volunteered that they were there
and offered to show them to the officers, who
then went away. What happened after that?
Mr. Duplessis took charge of these goods. I
assume that he thereby acted within bis rights;
and the only position taken by the Dominion
Government then, or at any other time, was
tht, the courts of Canada were open to the
respective claimants of these treasures.
These are the facts, and upon these facts,
as stated by Mr. St. Laurent, the subsequent
allegation of Mr. Duplessis was made. I refer,
honourable senators, not to my sketchy report
of the circumstances, but to the full, detailed
and responsible statement made by Mr. St.
Laurent on March 4 in the House of Commons.
At this point I feel free to assure our
French-Canadian fellow citizens that Mr. St.
Laurent is regarded by us as a great Cana-

dian. He is a French Canadian of whom every
Canadian is proud. It will greatly contribute
to the unity of Canada if the next Prime
Minister of this country is a French Canadian
like Mr. St. Laurent, and I believe there
could be no happier augury of Canadian unity
than that a man of the broad vision, the
tolerant spirit, the high character, the charming
personality and the balanced outlook on Canadian affairs possessed by Mr. St. Laurent,
should succeed Mr. Mackenzie King as Prime
Minister of this country. It would be a
tragedy if the prospects of Mr. St. Laurent to
achieve this distinction, which reflect the
wishes of the Canadian people, were to be
defeated by attacks made against him in the
bouse of bis friends. For the sake of the unity
of Canada, I hope the attacks will not succeed.
Let me come in the next place to a consideration of attacks from an unexpected quarter, and which I think are detrimental to the
maintenance of our institutions in these trying
times. The great Conservative party, or shall
I say, the once great Conservative partyHon. Mr. HOWARD: "Progressive" now.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: It is for my honourable
friend to say how far it bas progressed-has
always been the self-constituted champion of
our institutions, or at any rate of the institutions we have inherited from Great Britain.
It is disquieting to observe the attacks which
are being directed at the present time from
some sections of that once great party. Speaking as a Liberal, I would not be concerned if
as a consequence of these tactics the Conservatives advanced their own cause, because it
seems to me that, after a Liberal government
bas remained in office as long as this government will probably stay there, no great harm
would result were they succeeded by the Conservatives. ln this century the Conservatives
have never stayed long in office, and though
from a Liberal standpoint their regime would
be regarded as reactionary, the harm they
would do and the mistakes they would make
could be remedied after the next election. The
real danger, which gives me concern and
prompts me to make these comments, is that
aspersions of the kind to which I am going to
refer, directed against our higher officials in
parliament, in government and in the courts,
impugning leaders who have been in control
of our affairs since long before the last war,
would, if they should result in the defeat of
the Liberal party, tend to strengthen the
hands of the more subversive elements in this
country.
You need not tell me. honourable senators,
that if the people of Canada are misled by
attempts to discredit not only the greatest

MARCH 17, 1948

judge this country has ever produced, but a
man who has held the office of Prime Minister
longer than anyone else in Canada, and longer
than practically any man in the British
Empire, harm will not result. Any undermining effect this preaching may have will not
help the Conservative party, but will tend to
destroy all present forms of constituted governrent; and it will encourage and assist
those who are promoting subversive activities
in this country today.
Some Hon. SENATORS:

Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. FARRIS: No doubt honourable
senators have anticipated that I am going to
refer to the inquiry into the Hong Kong
incident of 1941. I approach the consideration
of this question from two standpoints. First,
I aisk you what is the need and the justification for investigating and stirring up this
question at the present time? Secondly, I
ask you to consider, in the light of what I
have said, the kind of attacks that are being
made.
Let me briefly refresh your memory with
some dates. Throw your minds back to the
serious condition in which the British Commonwealth of Nations found itself in September 1941, prior to the time when the Americans
entered the war. At that time it was suggested by the British Government that it
would be a good thing to send some Canadian
troops to Hong Kong. In response to that
request 2,000 Canadian soldiers were sent to
that city on the Awatea, arriving in due
course. On December 7, 1941, Pearl Harbor
was attacked. You know what a bolt from
the blue that was. You know how little the
Americans anticipate.d that attack. The following day Hong Kong was attacked. Our
soldiers were there along with British soldiers,
to hold the city, but on December 24, 1941, it
was forced to surrender. Many of our Canadian soldiers were killed, and the remainder
were taken prisoners of war. Naturally this
sas a great shock to the people of Canada.
It was charged that these soldiers were not
properly trained. My understanding is -that
none of the soldiers sent there or to Britain
were completely trained. Canada had not
been a military country and all Canadian
soldiers, after receiving a certain amount of
training, were sent overseas to receive further
training there.
It has been charged that full equipment was
not sent forward on the same ship in which the
soldiers were transported to Hong Kong. I
shall have something to say about that in a
minute. It bas also been charged that before
these soldiers were dispatched the Canadian
government knew that war was imminent.

There has been a lot of shifting and sliding
from under these allegations, but the last
charge is the basic one. The charge levelled
against our Prime Minister is that he knew
that war was imminent, and that with that
knowledge he deliberately sent our sons,
without proper equipment, into a field of
combat where they ought not to have
been. That is the whole gravamen of the
charge. But it is not confined to Mackenzie
King; it must go down the line to the men
who advised him, to the ministers who were in
charge of the department at the time-Mr.
Ralston, the Minister of National Defence,
and Mr. Power, the Minister for Air-and
to the military command from whom, after
all, the Prime Minister must take advice.
At the time the men were sent to Hong
Kong Mr. Ralston was on his way to Europe,
leaving Mr. Power burdened with the responsibility of not only his own department but
that of Mr. Ralston, and it was under Mr.
Power's supervision and responsibility that
this contingent was sent overseas. One of
the nien in that force was Mr. Power's own
son. Honourable senators, I do not drag in
this fact as a defence. Any man holding any
of the positions held by Mackenzie King, Mr.
Power or General Crerar, would owe as
great a responsibility to the son of any man
in this country as he would to his own son.
Perhaps I do not know Mr. Power well
enough to call him "Chubby", but to my
mind he is a great Canadian with a fine
sense of public duty.
Some Hon. SENATORS:

Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. FARRIS: I am confident that not
for anything in the world would he indifferently, callously, or recklessly, send boys to a
fate that they should not have met. The fact
that one of the boys in that contingent
happened to be his own son is only an incident
to keep in mind.
What I say as true of "Chubby" Power is
also true of Canada's Prime Minister, no
matter what is charged by Mr. Drew or by
the Toronto Globe and Mail. The charge, on
its face, is almost conclusively answered withMackenzie King would not
out evidence.
knowingly do anything of that kind. But
that is the charge. It is not charged that the
department was at fault, or that the Prime
Minister overlooked something under the
stress of the thousand and one things he had
to do at that time. No, the charge is made
that he, knowing the untrained condition of
these troops, and that there was danger of
imminent war, sent them to Hong Kong. I
say it disproves itself. Honourable senators,
you must consider the conditions in Canada

SENATE

in 1940 and 1941 and not those of today. You
will remember Dunkirk. According te my
information there were ill-equipped and illtrained Canadian soldiers in England at that
time; but they stood between Britain and
complete disaster.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: People talk about
knowing things. I wonder what these gentlemen would have said if Canada had been
responsible for Singapore? It is easy to look
back and say what should have been done in
1940 and 1941. It is casy to forget the strain
that was on every man at that time, the
desperate conditions which existed, and the
chances that all Canadians, Britishers, and
Allies were taking all over the world. Have
you forgotten what Churchill said when he
stood with his back to the wall in Britain and
uttered that inspiring speech, the greatest
speech that history has ever recorded? Whatever other qualities Churchill has-and they
are many-his dominating courage w.as the
thing that saved the British Empire.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: There was natural concern when those two thousand young men were
killed or taken prisoners, and in the early part
of 1942 Sir Lyman Duff, Chief Justice of
Canada-and let me emphasize those last four
words-was appointed a commissioner to hold
an inquiry in regard to this matter.
Hon. Mr. DUFF: He comes from a proud
race.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: Personally, I should feel
relieved if my honourable friend would restrain
his remarks until later.
Hon. Mr. DUFF: I was complimenting you.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: I do not need it.
Sir Lyman Duff heard the evidence, all the
evidence; he weighed the facts; he heard all
the arguments of counsel who were there, and
of course took into consideration all the conditions that existed; and in his findings he
exonerated the government and the army
command of blame for the ill-fated expedition.
That did not suit Mr. Drew. He was not
Prime Minister of Ontario at that time. He
demanded another inquiry and he made
charges. Some of them have come to light in
the newspapers-I got this information from
the Ottawa Citizen. In a letter to Mr. Mackenzie King at that time, he charges that the
findings of the commissioner-who was Sir
Lyman Duff, Chief Justice of Canada-are
directly contrary to the facts. There are a lot

of other charges in his letter, but that is
enough, that the findings are directly contrary
to the facts.
That was more than six years ago. Let us
draw some comparisons in out minds. The
commissioner was the Chief Justice of Canada,
and he had been on the bench of the Supreme
Court of Canada for more than forty years.
As a lawyer of a great deal of experience, I say
that Sir Lyman Duff has been regarded and is
regarded as the greatest judge Canada has ever
produced.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: Many times I have conversed with Law Lords of the Privy Council
and with my colleagues in the legal profession
in England, and I can say that Sir Lyman
Duff is as highly regarded and respected over
there as he is here in Canada. Net only was
he experienced, but where in Canada could
you have secured anybody as impartial? Just
stop and think that over, honourable senators.
I am not sure-I intended to look this up, but
I forgot about it-whether he was appointed
Chief Justice by the Liberals or the ConservativEs. But does it make any difference? I
know it was Mr. Bennett who recommended
that be be given a knighthood. Why should
Sir Lyman Duff be partial? Why should he,
of all men in Canada, when he was nearing
the termination of his great career, stultify
himself to the knowledge of those who had
charge of those questions?
On the other hand, who is the man that
purports to sit in judgment on the Chief
Justice? A partisan advocate. Does anybody
dispute that?
Does anybody dispute that
when Mr. Drew took this position he was
seeking kudos for himself and the party that
he claimed to represent?
But, honourable
senators. if Mr. Drew had properly appreciated
his position he would have known and he
would have told the public that he was not
appointed as a partisan advocate at all. I
have the material here. Sir Lyman Duff wrote
to Mr. Hanson, the then leader of the opposition, and asked him to name one of the three
counsel. They were to do what? To represent the commissioner, to be under his direct
authority and to continue in office only until
the commission was terminated. Mr. Hanson
wrote back and suggested the name of Mr.
Drew, and the Chief Justice then wrote to
Mr. Drew and appointed him to that position.
Those are the facts as to how Mr. Drew came
into the job.
I say that Mr. Drew was under the most
unqualified obligation of secrecy. I do not
think honourable senators realize how drastic
was that obligation of secrecy. On the very

MARCH 17, 1948

opening of the commission the Chief Justice
laid it down that there was an absolute
secrecy about everything that went on. On
every document, on every word of transcript
that was handed to Mr. Drew, was a memorandum that this is secret, that it can be
shown by you to nobody else, that no copies
of it shall be made, and that at the end of the
inquiry or before the end you must return it
to the commission. Do honourable senators
know that Mr. Drew's secretary and all the
other secretaries were made to take an oath
of secrecy? Mr. Drew did not have to take
an oath of secrecy, because he belonged to a
profession whose oath of office is as solemn
and binding as anything could be, requiring
him to live up to those obligations. Well,
honourable senators it is for you and for the
people of Canada to consider this matter.
I am asking honourable senators to consider
the Chief Justice as the tribunal, and Mr.
Drew as the judge of the judge. Look at it
from the point of view of ability to analyse
evidence, to sift it, and come to your own conclusions. How many cases did you ever hear
of Mr. Drew having in the courts? What
experience has he had? I am not making any
attacks. It is just as honourable to be in the
newspaper business, maybe, as it is to be a
lawyer, but I am talking about the qualifications of a man who sets himself up to judge
another man. What ability, what experience,
has Mr. Drew to justify his asking the people
to accept him to sit in judgment on the
Chief Justice of Canada? What experience
did Mr. Drew have to set up against Sir
Lyman Duff's forty-odd years as a judge on
the Supreme Court of Canada? And remember, honourable senators, not only was Sir
Lyman Duff then the Chief Justice of Canada,
but he was the Right Honourable Sir Lyman
Duff, a member of His Majesty's Imperial
Privy Council, who many times had sat on
the Privy Council in London and more than
once had written the decisions of that great
board. One would find it difficult to imagine
Mr. Drew in either of those positions.
I am not criticizing Mr. Drew because of
his partiality.
He had a right to be a
partisan advocate, if he wanted to. That is a
privilege which I, as a lawyer, have often
exercised, and when I am a partisan advocate
I pride myself on being a partisan and presenting my case to the very limit. And sometimes, after I lose a case, I am inclined to
think that the judge is wrong and that I am
wiser than he. However, in those circumstances lawyers cool off and have second
thoughts, and when they differ with a judge
they do not presume to come out and make
attacks reflecting directly upon him and his

263

integrity. I do not choose to raise the question of Mr. Drew's honesty, but when he
puts his charges in such a way that honourable
senators, if they believe them, are disturbed
about the honesty of the Chief Justice, it
then becomes necessary for every citizen of
Canada to inquire as between them, and to
judge which they are to credit.
If Mr. Drew had practised law as long and
as extensively as I have, he would have learned
that there is a vast difference between an
honourable and proper method of appealing
from the judgment of a judge and coming out
with charges of false findings such as he has
made. I am proud to be a member of the
legal profession, and I know all honourable
senators here who are lawyers feel the same
way about the profession. They are proud
of its tradition and code of honour, and would
not stultify themselves by attacking the
honesty of the judges before whom they
appear.
I have read some newspapers' editorials to
the effect that it is all right to criticize a judge
acting as a commissioner. I go farther than
that, and say that it is in order to criticize the
judgment of a judge, provided it is done in
a proper and self-respecting manner.
As
lawyers, we are doing that every day. We
appeal from the decisions of judges and we
represent that the judges, no matter how
honest they may have been, have not given
proper consideration to certain evidence, and
we submit that other evidence should have
been given more weight.

There are times when the courts of appeal
overrule trial judges, though the law is well
established that special weight must be given
to the findings of the trial judges, who have
had the opportunity of seeing witnesses and
hearing the evidence first-hand. It is only
in exceptional cases that our appeal courts
overrule trial judges on questions of fact; and
when there are findings of fact by two courts,
a third court will not listen to any argument
on .that score. But a lawyer who would put
in his notice of appeal or factum an allegation
that the findings of the learned trial judge
were false, and put it in such a way as to reflect
on the judge's integrity, would be treated
most severely, not only by the court but also
by the discipline committee of the legal
profession.
I shall deal later with the distinction that
is offered between "judge" and "commissioner."

Honourable senators, at the moment the
Chief Justice brought in his report Mr. Drew,
in his capacity as counsel for the commission
became, to use a good legal expression, functus
officio. ,He was then through and no longer

SENATE

had any status as counsel for the commission.
But he then undertook to be a kind of amicus
curiae-a friend of all people-to save them
from what had happened. Honourable senators may go back in their memories to Mr.
Drew's statement at that time. He said, "We
do net want a scapegoat, but we want a real
inquiry so that we can prevent tragedies like
this from happening in the future and resulting in the loss of Our sons."
I ask, honourable senators, if Mr. Drew was
net looking for a scapegoat in 1942, why is he
looking for one today? Many things have
happened in the intervening six years since
the inquiry. The war continued to its bitter
success; Mr. Power and Mr. Ralston both
resigned from office for different reasons-Mr.
Power because conscription was brought in
and Mr. Ralston because it was not brought
in soon enough or did net go far enough.
General McNaughton was brought into the
government to succeed Mr. Ralston. If there
was concern that the inquiry had not cured
the evils, one would have thought that the
bringing in of the general who had been in
charge of the Canadian army, to succeed Mr.
Ralston, would have given the necessary
assurance.
I ask honourable senators, does Mr. Drew
or do his satellites, either flesh or pulp, suggest
any way in which this inquiry now can help
the war that is over? Is le suggesting that
the inquiry must take place in order to help
in the next war? That is pure nonsense!
Honourable senators, there is grave danger
of another war. The statement of President
Truman today brings it home in a way that
we ourselves hadi not realized. But there is
sonething that Mr. Drew, Mr. Duplessis, and
every leader in provincial, federal and municipal affairs.-and indleed our private citizens
-can do in the light of the tragedies we face;
they can help us to close our ranks and work
fer the common cause of Canada.
There is only one other reason given by
Drew why we should, d'ig up this old question
and rake over these old ashes now, and that
is the Maltby report. I have the report before
me, dated January 1948. General Maltby, I
understand, was the English general in charge
of Hong Kong at the time of the disaster.
Perhaps Mr. Drew told' you about this report,
but I luad net seen it until after I gave my
notice of motion.
On page 1, paragraph 5, I read these words:
"Tbat war was inevitable seemed clear to
me."
And it must be remembered that General
Maltby was in Hong Kong.

He continues:
I had all my forces deployed in their battle
positions in ample time, but it was hard to
make that definite statement on the information
available,In Hong Kong he was in a far better position to make that statement than was Mr.
Moreover, his
Mackenzie King in Ottawa.
only job was to d'efend: Hong Kong, while Mr
King was in charge of all the many problems
affecting Canada.
General Maltby continues:
-with the result that the civil authorities felt
that they were not in a position to put into
full force all the numerous mueasures required

during the preliminary or the precautionary
period of the Civil Defence plan. For this
state of affairs I must blame three factors:(a) The general doubt that Japan would declare war ýagainst the Allied powers.
I d'o not think Mr. Drew told us about that
statement.
(b) The weakness of our intelligence systein.
And, who was responsible for that? Certainly not Mr. Mackenzie King, and not
General Crerar.
(c) The belief that Japan was bluffing and
would continue to bluff to the last. The truc
gravity of the state of affairs was not reflected
in the embassy despatches from Tokyo.
Honourable senators, I omitted something
I should have said about this question of
secrecy. The fact is that certain secret despatches from the military authorities in
England came to the Department of External
Affairs here. Those are the despatches about
which we are now hearing such a furore. What
are the facts about these secret despatches?
They were brought te the commissioner by
a representative of the Department of External
The commissioner took them into
Affairs.
the conference room, where he was accompanied only by the three counsel who were his
representatives. He would not allow either
his own secretary or a stenographer to be
present, nor would Le permit any note of the
documents to be taken. fhey were retained
for thirty minutes, and then folded up and
returned to the Under Secretary of External
Affairs. These facts should be kept in mind
when the circumstances concerning the production of these documents are discussed. The
British government from the moment they
were received here have persistcd in their refusal te allow publication. Are the people of
Canada prepared te repudiate the obligation
of secrecy under which they were received?
Noiw let me read what is stated in the
report as to the information to hand at the
time. I refer not to the commissioner's find-

MARCH 17, 1948
ing but to exhibits at the end of his report.
Here is a telegram, dated October 30, 1941,
from London:
We are very grateful to you for despatching
your contingent to Hong Kong at such short
notice. We fully realize the difficulties of
mobilization and of distance which have had to
be overcome. The moral effect of their arrival
in November will be much greater than it would
have been two months later.
I wonder what this gentleman who is so
solicitous about our safety and all the rest of
it would have said if the King government and
General Crerar and his military advisers had
rejected the request of Britain, and said, "Oh,
we will not send these boys, because, no matter
how much moral support it may give, we are
not going to take a chance". I wonder what
would have been said about Mr. Power if he
had stated, "I will not allow my boy to face
the hazards of the trip and what may happen
afterwards, no matter how great the moral
effect tbeir presence might have". Remember
that in these days everything was hanging in
the balance. Morale was a supremely important factor. We recall that the moral effect
in those critical days of the personality of
Churchill, and the moral effect throughout
that period of the presence of our men, did
much to turn almost inevitable disaster into
final victory.
Here is another telegram, sent on October
26 from London by the Canadian Command
over there:
Consensus opinion that war in Far East unliikely at present.
Did Sir Lyman Duff give consideration to
these questions; and if be did, by what
authority does a counsel, whose functions then
had ceased, set himself up in judgment on
the decision of that great judge?
The troops sailed on October 27, the day
after that cable came from the Canadian
authorities in London to the authorities in
this country. Later I shall refer to the
decisions which General Crerar made on that
occasion.
Time went on. Then came the Maltby
report, which was made the excuse for this
new attack. Mr. Drew has renewed his reflections upon the Chief Justice, and bas shown
more boldness in his attacks upon the Prime
Minister of Canada. Let it not be forgotten
that during the last federal election Mr. Drew
aired these grievances, or had the opportunity
of doing so, and that the verdict of the jury
was in favour of the government. He asserts
that the Prime Minister knew that the danger
of Japanese aggression was imminent, and

that our troops were being sent over there
ill-trained and ill-equipped. Speaking of Mr.

265

King's solemn denial in the House of Cornmons, be says that be "is simply piling falsehood on falsehood". If such statements are
permissible, we shall get down to a position
where the buttons will be off the foils, and you
can call a man pretty well anything you like.
I hope I shall be more restrained.
A member of parliament from Manitoba, a
Mr. Ross, who I believe stands high in the
ranks of the Conservative party, made a speech
which appears--in case you want to look at it
at some time when it will be in order for
you to read it-at page 1981 of Hansard. He
said that the people of Canada were becoming
"suspicious of Chief Justice Sir Lyman Duff."
In that statement, I fear, there is some truth.
But why are they becoming suspicious? Not
because of anything which Sir Lyman Duff did
in the performance of duty, but because this
type of insinuation, of innuendo, of unfair
attack, is being made by the so-called leader
of a great party.
We come now to the Toronto Globe and
Mail of Friday last, in which the statement
appears that Sir Lyman Duff was making findings contrary to facts; that they were "false

on four counts". There may be more excuse
for a newspaper which uses such expressions
than for a lawyer who makes them. To me it
is unthinkable that a lawyer should countenance such statements. Yet, remembering on
what a pedestal this paper puts itself, talk of
this kind cannot be condoned. Reflect, honourable senators, what is implied in this statement that "Mackenzie King was guilty of
knowingly sending untrained and unequipped
troops into a known theatre of possible war."
In the words of Shakespeare in Julius Caesar,
"Mischief, thou art afoot". To make that kind
of charge against the Prime Minister of this
country at this time in his career is the most
terrible thing I have ever seen done in Canadian journalism. What does it mean? Not
only that he is falsifying the record, but that
the blood of the boys who were killed in that
expedition is upon him.
Mr. Ilsley, as Minister of Justice, in a
characteristically moderate reply, remonstrated
with the Globe and Mail. I want to call the
attention of honourable senators to the
editorial retort. How does it begin? The
writer has the unmitigated effrontery to start
in this way:
The abusive attack on a Globe and Mail
editorial writer by the Right Hon. J. L. Ilsley,
Minister of Justice, completely fails . . .
Abusive attack? The pot calls the kettle
black, but in this case the pot is black and
the kettle is not.

continues:
It was because of this respect, in fact, that
reference to Sir Lyman's official status was deli-

berately omitted from the editorial.
I do net know whether that is audacious
sophistry or childish quibbling, but I am
inclined to think it is both. You have heard
about the curate's egg; it was good in spots.
The Globe and Mail suggests: Oh, we were
net attacking the character and integrity of
this man as a judge; we were only attacking
his character and integrity as a commissioner.
That is too subtle for most Canadians. The
assumption that the people of this country
would net know that Sir Lyman Duff was the
Chief Justice of Canada, simply because the
editorial did not so describe him, is too thin
for publication even in this paper.
What are the facts? There is a provision
in our Acts giving judges certain powers and
privileges. In the opening of the proceedings
Sir Lyman announced that he had before him
an order in council reciting that he, as the
commissioner, had all the rights, privileges and
powers of a judge sitting in a court. Now I
say there is a proper way to criticize the
findings of a commissioner, just as there is
a right way to criticize the findings of a judge;

but in neither case is a man with Mr. Drew's
legal standing entitled to go before the Canadian public with the kind of charges e has
made against the head of the judiciary of
Canada, and the Toronto Globe and Mail and
Mr. Ross of Manitoba have no greater right to
do so.
Listen to this:

net. But this man bas passed judgment. Notwithstanding the findings of Sir Lyman Duff,

courteously gave Mr. Hanson the privilege of
naming one of the counsel. Mr. Drew was
recommended, and Sir Lyman Duff appointed
him on that recommendation.
Honourable senators, I should now like to
refer back to the original article written last
Friday. To my mind the following is very
important:
It is also beyond question, from the testimony
given by the Hon. C. G. Power, Acting Minister
of National Defence, and the responsible political authority, that he believed there was "a
real danger of war with Japan"Yeu see, they quote those words "a real
danger of war with Japan", and they stop
quoting there.
Then the article goes on to say:
Under the circumstances, it did not matter
whether the war came immediately, or months
later. The guilt of the government is in nowise
lessened.
Do honourable senators see how they are
backing d'own on their original charge? A
person bas to study the thing pretty carefully
to realize what they are doing. This writer
states that men who were not fully trained
should not have been sent overseas when war
was imminent. But the same thing happened
across the Atlantic. Men received training up
to a certain stage in this country and were
then sent overseas, where they completed
their training.
When this newspaper says that it makes
no difference whether war is imminent or net,
the saine guilt rests on the government, it is
giving away its whole case. Why is it backing
down, honourable senators? I shall tell you
the reason. It is to be found in a statement
made by Mr. Power in the House of Commons
on Mai-cl 5. He rose on a question of priviwhat lie said explains why the
lege, ad
Toronto Globe and Mail is backing down on
what was the main assertion of their whole
charge: that the knowledge of war was immediately imminent. At page 1911 of the House
of Commons Hansard Mr. Power says:
I am quoted in support of Premier Drew's
statement as having said in evidence before the
Hong Kong inquiry the following:
I felt, perhaps without any sound basis except
having read these despatches, that there was a
very good chance of war breaking out with
Japan.
Premier Drew stopped with that quotation
right there, and the Toronto Globe and Mail

MARCH 17, 1948

does the same. But what did Mr. Power say
when he got up on the floor of the house?
This is what he said:
In justice to al parties, including myself,
I think I should say that in the very next
Une of my evidence, in reply to a direct question
as tW whether I believed war with Japan was
imminent, I said no, war with Japan is not
imminent.
That is the very next sentence in the testimony of Mr. Power, quoted by Mr. Drew and
the Globe and Mail, but on both occasions
that is not published.
Considering the reliability of these men
who set themselves up as judges over the
Chief Justice of Canada, I ask honourable
senators if there is any more misleading form
of misquotation than to read only half an
answer. That is exactly what was don here to
the knowledge of the Toronto Globe and
Mail and, of course, to the knowledge of
Premier Drew when he made his first
statement.
Who was General Crerar? He was i.n command of the forces in Canada when these
troops were sent overseas to Hong Kong. He
is the man who passed judgment on their
qualifications and on him rests the direct
responsibility of sending them over there. I
wonder if the Globe and Mail ever quoted this
extract from Sir Lyman Duff's report. I am
readi.ng from page 21:
It is well to emphasize that General Crerar
laid it down as the fundamental condition of the
selection of the units for this force that "they
should be efficient, well-trained battalions, cap,
able of upholding the credit of the Dominion
in any circumstances"; and his decision that
they fulifilled that condition is the basis of his
General Crerar was not
recommendation.
merely giving an opinion; he was deciding upon
a ratter of fact which it was his duty as Chief
of the General Staff te decide, for the purpose.
of making recommendabion concerning the composition of this force, upon which he expected
the minister to act, and, in the result, knew he
was acting. Having regard to General Crerar's
special knowledge of all the considerations to be
taken into account, and his special qualifications for forming a judgment thereon, there is
a most powerful presumption in favour of the
correctness of his determination given in good
faith and in the course of duty, to which it
would be proper to give effect in the absence of
clear evidence of error. It is, however, as I
conceive it, my duty to examine the question
of the propriety of the selections and to consider the oral evidence and the documents
produced.
And here is a paragraph from a written
report that General Crerar made before these
men were sent to Hong Kong:
As you know, these units returned not long
ago from duty in Newfoundland and the West
-Indies, respectively. The duties which they
there carried out were not in many respects un-

like the task which awaits the units to be sent
to Hong Kong. The experience they have had
will therefore be of no small value to them in
their new role. Both are units of proven
efficiency.
And in May 1942, in sworn testimony taken
in London, to be sent over to the commission,
he said he still adhered to that opinion.
General Crerar was in charge of our forces
in Canada, having succeeded General McDoes
Naughton as Commander in Chief.
anybody question General Crerar's great
record? Would anybody presume to challenge
his opinion that those men were qualified, and
brand it as false? No, the Globe and Mail
would not do that, nor would Mr. Drew do
that. Yet, honourable senators, that decision by General Crerar is the decision that was
responsible for sending these men overseas. It
was the recommendation of a responsible
man. I am not attaching any blame at all
to him; I am saying that he knew the position,
the perils and the necessity for moral support.
He knew the training those men had had, and
he expected they would have opportunities for
further training after they got over there. He
took that responsibility, and I would like to
know why Mr. Drew should attack Mr.
Mackenzie King and ignore the recommendation of General Crerar in that connection.
What would Drew have said if the government
had turned down General Crerar's decision?
Honourable senators, I have not time to go
into ,this matter further, but I invite members who are interested to look into the
charge about the lack of ammunition for the
3-inch mortars in the fighting on the 22nd of
December. What are the facts? I will not
quote from General Maltby's report, but
honourable senators can read it for themselves.
There was no ammunition in Canada for those
mortars. The mortars were sent over from
this country, and there is on record a dispatch
from the British government that they would
supply the ammunition for those mortars
and ship it to Hong Kong. However, they
sent only 70 rounds, as 'there was a scarcity
of that ammunition in Britain.
The Globe and Mail says that a newspaper
has as much right as a judge to express its
conclusions on the evidence. I point out that
judges have no opportunity of coming back
and defending themselves when they are
attacked. The newspaper alse says that it
has a duty to perform for the people of
Canada. I am impressed with an editorial in
the Ottawa Citizen of yesterday, which makes
this comment on the Globe and Mail editorial:
Such a statement exceeds the bounds of
decent journalism . . . Moreover, the newspaper's own motives are not above suspicion.

SENATE

I wonder why?
It smites Mr. Mackenzie King's government
at every opportunity. On the other band, Sir
Lyman Duffs conclusions were based on the full
evidence; and his reputation as an impartial
judge is beyond dispute.
Now, honourable senators, you can take
your choice between Duff and Drew, and
between Duff and George-I cannot think of
his last name.
An Hon. SENATOR: McCullagh.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: Let the people of
Canada draw their own conclusions as to the
capacities of these men and their methods.
The Globe and Mail's charges of dishonesty and so on make me feel free to express
my thoughts on the matter without qualification. I say those editorials are a discredit
to the press of Canada. The editor and publisher both ought to be ashamed of themselves.
To my mind, the reiteration of this charge
shows the disposition and intent of a newspaper bully to intimidate Mr. Ilsley for his
presumption, in the performance of his duty
in his high office, in remonstrating against such
attacks on a judge in the highest judicial
position.
Fortunately, this kind of thing does not
happen often in Canada. If we are to preserve
our democratie institutions and our way of
life, our people must have a full measure of
confidence in our judges and our judicial
system, and there must be no splitting of hairs
as to whether a judge is performing judicial
functions on the bench in an ordinary court
or in a commission. Let me point out that
the necessity of having the Chief Justice as
commissioner was greater than usual in this
particular inquiry, where absolute secrecy was
essential. A roar would have gone up all over
this country if a private citizen had been
appointed commissioner, and the inquiry
would have been described as a hole-in-thecorner affair. I am referring to this because
some persons have taken the stand that judges
should not be appointed to commissions. In
general I agree with that stand. When J was
president of the Canadian Bar Association I
took strong ground on this question in my
presidential address; I said it was net good
policy to drag our judges into every controversial form of inquiry that was held. But,
honourable senators, there was no reason why
this Hong Kong inquiry should have been
controversial. There was no politics involved
in it. It was only a question of checking up
on something that had gone wrong, on one of
the tragedies of the war.
Mr. Drew was
appointed as counsel representing one of our
parties, net to make politics out of the inquiry,

but to help the commissioner get to the root
of the matter. That was why the highest and
most respected judge we have ever had in
Canada was selected for that position. Let me
say with all the solemnity at my command,
that if the Conservative party succeeds in
traducing and dragging down the reputation
of our most renowned judge, sitting as a commissioner, he will to the same extent be traduced in his judicial position; and if he falls
the whole judiciary will fall along with him in
public respect. If the opposition succeeds in
undermining the respect of Mr. King in this,
probably the last year of his term of office, by
causing the people to believe that he has
betrayed them in this terrible way, and should
he fall under that charge. O, what a fall is
there my countrymen! Then I, and you, and
all of us fall down, because we can never
survive the disaster of such a reflection on our
political and judicial institutions in Canada.
In a spirit of co-operation and friendliness
let me say to every public man, irrespective of
the view he represents, that there is in Canada
today a great field for progressive thought,
for constructive criticism and for a common
endeavour for the welfare of all. There is no
need for stirring up disunity in Canada at this
time, and no reason for raking up the dead
past. Nero fiddled while Rome burned, and
Mr. Drew rakes up the dead ashes of past
events while new fires are burning. There are
too many gigantie problems facing us in the
immediate future to spend our time reviewing
events past and gone.
I feel more impressed with the need of what
I am now saying, after the speech Mr. Truman
made today, than if I had spoken at any
previous time. I feel, honourable senators,
that so far as we can escape the despair of
what threatens us, we ought to look forward
to what we can achieve as Canadians for
Canada. May I close with these words from
Shelley:
Oh cease! Must bate and death return?
Cease! Must men kill and die?
Cease! Drain not to its dregs the urn
Of bitter prophecy!
The world is weary of the pastOh might it die, or rest at last.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. J. J. DONNELLY:
Honourable
senators, during the early part of the very
able speech which we have just heard from
the honourable senator from Vancouver South
(Hon. Mr. Farris) I was disposed to put a
question to him, but realizing that he was
delivering a serious address, refrained because
I did not wish to interrupt him. Now that he
has completed his remarks, I should like to
put the question to him.

MARCH 17, 1948

Hon. Mr. FARRIS: I have great respect for
any question my honourable friend may wish
to ask.
Hon. Mr. DONNELLY: I quite agree with
what rny lionourable friend had to say ini
lauding the good qualities of Mr. St. Laurent.
I have been in publie life long enough to
know that ne one political party bas a mnonopoly on great and good men in the public life
of this country.
Perhaps in fairness I should say that I
would not ask this question except that it is
St. Patrick's Day. When I heard the lionourable senator laud Mr. St. Laurent as a great
French Canadian, who would like to be the
Prime Minister of Canada somne day, I wondered if he realized that Mr. St. Laurent had
the great and good fortune to have an Irish
lady by the naine of Broderick for bis mother.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: That makes him none
the less a great French Canadian and a great
Canadian.
Hon. JOHN T. HAIG: Honourable members, I do not intend te- delay the bouse
more than a few minutes with what I have te
say. But I must be quite candid and state
that I was very shocked by the address 1
hecard ibis afteinoon. In my opinion-and I
have beert in this bouse quite a few years-that was a pelitical speech sucb as one migli
hear in another place. I believe that it wil1
do no good, and that it will make difficulties
for this chamber in years to corne.
I do not propose te attempt te answer mny
honourable friend; I could not if I would, and
would not if I could. I do wish, however,
te raise one or twe points before I launch inte
my main argument. The honourable gentleman says, in effect, that there is a struggle in
the province of Quebec between Mr. St.
Laurent and Mr. Duplessis. I may net be
credited with being able te read the signs of
the times, but I arn persuaded that before
the year is over there witl be an election in
that province in which its people will decide
who they want as premier. I suggest te my
honourable friend that Mr. St. Laurent shouId
go down te Quebec and lead the Liberal forces
in the election, and that the people of that
province should decide whether tliey want Mr.
St. Laurent or Mr. Duplessis.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: We cannot afford te
lose him hetre.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: My point is that I amn
perfectly satisfied te ]et the people of Quebec
decide who they want.
My honourable friend indulged in a most
bitter attack on George Drew, Premier of the

province of Ontario. I understand that before
the year is out there rnay be an election in
this province. In tbat event I would suggest
te the honourable senater from Vancouver
South that be should corne te Ontario and
contest the election, and drive Mr. Drew eut
of public life, if he is able te do so. If he
succeeds hie will then find that lie bas a load
on bis bands, and hie will net have se much
time te practise the profession of which lie
says hie is such a distinguished member.
I do not pretend te be a distinguished- member of my profession, but I have had a little
experience in judging political trends. After
listening te the speech by my bonourable
friend it woýuld seem te me that there are two
provincial elections ceming up soon, one in
Ontario and one in Quebec. His speech mndicates that he believes the Liberal party in
each of those elections will net make a very
good showing, and that might affect the party's
prospect of winning the next dominion
election.
I knew Mr. Duplessis, and if my judgrnent
of hirn is correct, he will net take lying down
the castigation which my benourable friend
gave him this afterneon. I may be wrong in
that prediction, but I do net think I arn. I
expect that he will issue a challenge te Mr.
St. Laurent te go down there and fight it eut,
and I sheuld like te be sitting somewliere
nearby watching the battie. As te the
province of Ontarie, if my friend. tbinks
George Drew is sucli a bad acter, lie should
cerne te this province and try te revive the
Liberal party there. Re would have a difficult
task on bis ýhands.
As to the Hong Kong inquiry, the wliole
question hinges on the production of the evidence taken before the cemmissioner. Se far
one copy bas been tabled in the ether lieuse,
and up te the present moment, lionourable
leader of the government, no copy has been
tabled bere. The copy tabled in the other
place *consists of 2,300 pages, but it does flot
include ail the cables, because it is said the
British government will net release them.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: Well, is that not se?
Hen.. Mr. HAIG: Let me finish, my honourable friend.
If our government asked the Britishi gevernment fer permission te table them because
it was challenged te do se, the British government wouid release the telegrams.
Some Hon. SENATORS:
Tliey have
refused.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: My friends say the British
government has refused permission. I say they
could have been tabled if our government had

SENATE

asked that they be allowed to table them.
The Hong Kong difficulty arises from the fact
that the publie had not been given all the
evidence. Last year the opposition in the other
place made a bitter fight to obtain this evidence. Finally it was tabled, but the important
facts are contained in telegrams and cables
which are still withheld. Until these documents are available, violent discussion up and
down this country will continue.
I do not agree with my honourable friend in
his bitter attack on the Globe and Mail.
Almost from time immemorial the newspapers
of our country have been allowed to criticize
people. If the honourable senator lived in my
home city he would have reason ta know that,
compared with the sort of criticism to which
we are accustomed, the editorials in the Globe
and Mail are actually mild. For example, both
the Right Honourable Arthur Meighen and
the late Viscount Bennett were subjected in a
Winnipeg newspaper to comments of such a
vindictive character that one could hardly bear
to read them. Or take a current example. I
agree with the particular newspaper's views as
regards wheat marketing, but it must be
admitted that the tone of its references to the
Riglit Honourable Mr. Gardiner is most
bitter, and criticisms of him in that vein have
been continued for over a year.
My personal attitude to that kind of thing
is: If that is the paper's attitude, let it go
ahead. I Io net believe it ever influenced a
single vote. I recall very well a municipal
election when the late Colonel R. H. Webb,
who was standing for the mayoralty, was bitterly attacked by one of the Winnipeg newspapers. What was the result? He was elected
with a large majority. During the next two
ycars the attacks were continued, and at the
next election he was returned with a majority
even larger than before. Finally the business
manager advised the editor: "I think I would
eut out altogether these attacks on Webb. I
don't think people are influenced by your
editorials." I was of the same opinion.
All that the Hong Kong
controversy
amounts to is this: "Produce all the evidence
and let the publie judge". And they will
judge.
My honourable friend has stressed Sir
Lyman Duff's great record. When a judge
accepts a commission to investigate what is a
political question, because the commission was
set up in response to political demands, he
takes the risk of criticism from the side to
which his findings are adverse.
There is no doubt as to where the lawyers
of Canada stand upon this question. At the
meeting of the Canadian Bar Association at

Winnipeg in 1946, which some five hundred
members attended, a report was received from
the civil liberties committee upon questions
arising from the espionage inquiry.
This
report contained nearly two pages of recitals,
or "whereases", followed by the text of a
resolution. When it came before the convention, there was a violent discussion as to
whether these "whereases" should be retained.
As one of the delegates, I took part in the
debate and moved that all the "whereases"which in tone were very critical of the government and the then Minister of Justiceshould be struck out. I did not agree with
the recitals, and I said so, and they were
deleted. But none of the conclusions was
affected, and all of them were passed by a
vote of four or five hundred for, and not more
than five or six against. One of the resolutions
adopted, based on the committee's second
recommendation, was:
That the practice of appointing judges as commissioners to inquire into the conduct of persous . . . tends to confuse the functions of the

judiciary with that of the police and prosecuting counsel, and as such is detrimental to the
proper administration of justice and ought not
to be followed.
it will be renemibered that the specifie case

directed against the appointment of judges
to perform functions of this kind; and I am
strongly of opinion, though I cannot be sure,
that if the then Minister of Justice had to
nake the appointments again lie would not
select judges. Not a single voice was lcard
at the convention in opposition to the motion.
I have drawn attention to this incident in
order to emphasize that a member of the
Bench who accepts appointment as a commissioner ceases ta be a judge and becomes
a commissioner, and if a political issue is
involved, he renders himself liable ta the same
kind of criticism as thougli he had no judicial
standing. I do not think that my honourable
friend, in his references to the Hong Kong
inquiry, made this fact as clear as it should
be made.
I shall not digress to talk about or assail
the C.C.F., or to speculate on the probability
of war in Europe, or whether Shields should
be permitted to carry on his magazine, or this
or that person should be permitted to do
something else. I do not think that any of
these matters can properly be debated in this
house. We are not- here for that purpose. I
doubt very much whether it is appropriate for
us even to discuss a resolution of this kind.

MAÏtCH 17, 1948
It does nothing to throw liglit en the subject,
and it dos flot add to the dignity of this
house. If an issue had been raised concerning
the recent attack by the Premier of Sa»katchewan upon the judges of the provincial
Appeal Court because of certain judgments
of that court, I could understand the propriety of a declaration on our part to the
premier that "you cannot attack the Bench
under these conditions, because you are
impugning their judgment
as judges."
Thereby we would performi a service ta, the
administration of justice in this country. But
the strictures passcd by the Globe and Mail
are flot upon Sir Lyman Duif in his judicial
capacity. While I arn convinced that the
Globe an-d Mail is quite capable of taking
care of itself and needs no defence by me or
anyone else, I say that the newspaper was on
sound ground in criticizing the findings of the
commissianer, and that the press in general
and other persons are entitled to discuss the
issues as muoh as thýey like.
My honourahie friend has delivered a very
ahle partisan speech, but -it will not have
much eifect on the political future of this
country. If I were a member of the C.C.F.
the eifect af that speech would be to embitter
me against the Senate; and we as a body
should not have to suifer that sort of reaction,
hecause we are nat responsible for the speech.
It may be the opinion of My honourable
friend, after listening ta President 'Truman's
speech, that we -are facing another crisis in
Europe. But we 'have known that ail along;
there is no disputing it. The Russians in their
wisdom decided ta do certain things with
which I personally do nat agree. As the
records -of this house will show, ai ter the war
ended I was the first in this chamber ta draw
attention ta the menace of communismn, and I
have done sa frequently since. We in Winnipeg have experienced communism in action
longer than any other city. I say that with
ail due respect ta the honourable senator fram
Vancouver South (Hon. Mr. Farris). There
were members af the C.C.F. in the Manitoba
Legislature over thirty years ago.

Hon.!Mr. LAMBERT. In view of the great
importance which. the honourable leader of the
opposition attaches ta the questions which
have arisen in the last few days ini the discus-.
sion on Hong Kong, can lie gi'e any real
enlightenrnent on Vhe fact that in the election
campaign af 1945 the issue was noV raissd in
anything like the proportions it las now
assumsd? If these matters are important at
ths present time, surely they were infinitely
more important in 1945.
Han. Mr. HAIG: The war with Japan was
stili in progress in 1945.
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: The election campaign took place ýafter the San Francisco conference, which my honourable friend attended.
Hlon. Mr. HAIG: Na, ths election took
place during the conference in San Francisco,
and at that tîme we were sVili fighting Japan.
Indeed the war contînusd until, I believe,
August 14. If a persona] reference will be
pardoned, I knlow a good deal about it; a son
af mine wha fought for -a long time in Europe
came back and volunteered for service against
Japan. It would nat have been fitting ta raise
the Hang Kong issue when this country was
still in a state af war with Japan.
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: Wauld it noV have
been aIl the more pertinent then?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: No. These troope were
from the city of Winnipeg and from the prov-.
ince af Quebec. I do flot know about Quebec,
but opinion in Winnipeg is that these men
were impraperly trained and wers flot in
categary "A" according ta army health requiremente. They 'were category "B". IV is also
aur understanding that the troaps only lad
their email arms with them, and that the rest
af their equipment fallowed in another boat.
I .repeat that we at home feel that these men
were insufficiently trained ta ha sent ta Hong
Kong. Naturally we did flot know war was
caming ta that part af the world, but we felt
it. The allies ahl realized that there would
be no peace in Vhe world until Japan, was
stopped; and while the Americans did nat
anticipate the surprise attack on Pearl Harbor,
Vley felt that war wiVh Japan was imminent.
Those are the things that disturb me in
Vhis discussion, and I do flot Vhijik Vhis houe
can do anything ta salve the problem. The
only solution wouid be ta lay ail available
records on Vhe table. Mr. Drew wrote a letter,
but the governiment will flot ailow it ta be

up. Why did they noV prasecute him ta the
limit? At that time Mr. Drsw was an ordinary

SENATE

citizen; since then hie bas been twice elected
Premier of Ontario, the second time by a
large mai ority. Hie had a great record in the
flrst war, and if hie feels that the soldiers of
the Winnipeg Grenadiers and the Royal Rifles
of Quebe wcere net given a fair deal at Hong
Kong, 1 think hie sbould get ail the facts if
hie deems that to be his duty. If hie is provedi
to be wrong, I amn convinced that the people
of Canada, led by the people of Ontario, will
punish him.
The proper reply to Mr. Drew's allegations
is not a speech such as was made by my
friend from Vancouver South, but the production of ail the facts, se that the people of
this country may judge for themselves.
ilonourable senators, I do net agree with
the attacks that have been made on the
Premier of Ontario and the Premier of
Quebec. I thinrk it is a sad mistake to bring
politics of this character i.nto this hou;se. I
think that such matters should be dealt with
by the popular bouse.
Hon. Mr. DUFF: What about the Prime
Minister of Canada?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: The Prime Minister of
Canada was net attacked. I heard him praised,
but net attacked.
Hon. Mr. HOWARD: Is the honourable
leader opposite speaking te this motion or on
something else?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: My honourable friend
froým Wellington did net stop the senator from
Vancouver South when hie was speaking, and
he has ne right te stop me now. When the
senator from Vancouver South started speak-

ing 'he discussed events that took place back in
the years of the Flood, and I wondered if hie
was ever going te get down te the nin-eteentb
century. That should give me the rigbt te
wander aIl over.
Hon. Mr. CAMPBELL: Dees the honourable leader opposite net agree that in a controvcrsy of this kind-and I arn speaking of
the Hong Kong inquiry-there could flot have
been a more able or more capable coinmissioner appointed than Sir Lyman Duif?

Hon. Mr. HAIG: I make ne criticismn of
hirn. I merely say that once hie sat as a
commissioner hie ceased te sit as the Chief
Justice, and~ that he became subi ect te the
samne criticism that could be made of any
other individual who might sit as a
commissioner.
Hon. Mr. CAMPBELL: Dees the honourable leader opposite net agree that the charge

of the Toronto Globe and Mail, that the flndings of Sir Lyman Duif were false, is an unfair
one?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I have tried te dîstinguish,
as did the Canadian Bar at Winnipeg, between
a man taking a position as judge and as a

commissioner. I feel that the minute hie takes
a commissionership hie is subjeet te attack in
a political issue, the samne as anybody else.
Hon.

Mr.

MacLENNAN:

And

hie

can

immediatcly become crooked.
Hon. Mr. HAI'G: Some people think hie
dýid; but I do net say that. I amn net questioning the appointment of the commissioner,
but I say that ail the evidence, including
cables, letters and telegrams, should be placed
on the table, se that the people of Canada
cari judge whether the findings made by Sir

Lyman Duif were correct.
Hon. Mr. CAMPBELL: Does the bonourable leadýer suggest that the tabling of ail the
evidence, which I understancl consista of a
million words, would enable the public te
judge better than they coulci from reading the
report of Sic Lyman Duif?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: If I wece a Libecal member of tbe House of Commons, and all the
eviden-ce were placed on the table, I would
see what answers I could make te Mr. Drew's
charges if, in fact, ýhe did make charges. I
have neyer seen Mr. Drew's letter. It is said
that lie wcote one, but it bas neyer been produced. If I had as much love for study as
bas my friend from Vancouver South, I would
go througb ail that evidence and try te prove
Mr. Drew wcong; if I were an opposition
memnber I would go through it with the idea
of proving him right. Neither of these tbings
can be donc, though, witbout production of
ail the evidence.
Hon. Mc. CAMPBELL: You would do that
in order to prove the commissioner was
wrong?
Ho n. Mr. HAIG: Yes, if I took that view.
Hon. Mc. DUFF: Why net readà Mc. Drew's
letter?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I have net got it.
Hon. Mr. DUFF: Who has got it?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: The gevernment bas it.

MORAUD: I would inforrn the
senator frorn Toronto (Hon. Mr.
that it bas always been the
discuss cemmissioners' reports_
the vecy thing the senater from
South (Hon. Mc. Farris) bas

MARCH 17, 1948
accused the Toronto Globe and Mail of doing.
In 1931 my honourable friends critieized a
report made by the same commissioner. In
that year Sir Lyman Duif and Sir Joseph
Flavelle were appointed commissioners ta
investigate the railway situation. They brought
in a report which, of course, did flot please
everybody. At that time the leader of the
opposition in the House of Commons-the
present Prime Minister-and his followers
quite openly criticized the report of the commission. Nobody was scandalized by that
action, and no one has ever presented a motion
in the Senate ta blame who-ever might criticize findings made by judges or other people.
The motion of the senator from Vancouver
South (Hon. Mr. Fannas) is as follows:
That he will cali ta, the 'attention of the
Senate the fact that some men in publie positions and others and some newspapers are malting unjustiflable attacks on the integnity of men
in high office in a manner inimical ta the good
government of Canada and tending ta give encouragement ýta the subversive elements in the
land, and that he will at the same time inquire
into those matters.
I appeal ta honourable members of the
Senate ta say whether the uni ustifiable attacks,
if any have been made, were not made hene,
and very ab]y made, this afternoon. I arn sure
that in my province everybody wiIl strongly
resent the fact that the three men who have
been attacked this afternoon are a Baptist
minister from Toronto, the Prime Minister of
Quebec and the Prime Minister of Ontario.
Hon. Mr. DUFF: Three of a kind.

5853-19à

Hon. Mn. MORAUJD: The Quebec peoplewill be very glad ta hear that from ther
senator from Lunenhurg.
1 am quite sure that the senator from Vancouver South (Hon. Mr. Farnis) did not have
any mandate fnom the Right Honounable Mr.
St. Laurent ta do what he did this aftennoon.
I know enougli of the Ministen for Extennal
Aiffairs and of lis standing in my province ta,
realize that he does not need any lawyer to.
defend him. He can very well take care of'
himself.
Now a word about the Prime Minister of
Quebec. He is a fighter, lie strikes hard, and
he also can take care of himseif. Beingý
human, he of course makes mistakes, as everybody does, but in the province of Quebec lie
lias done a much betten job than any man hasever done in British Columbia. My honourable friend need not wonny about communisi
in Quebec. There, umlike British Columbia,
you will not sec any tint of communlism, and
for its absence we are indebted ta the Prime
Minister of the province.
I thought that as a senator from Quebec I
should make these remarks in answer ta the
speech by the senator from Vancouver South.

NEW WESTMINSTER HARBOUR
COMMISSIONERS BILL
FIRST READING

A message was received from the House of
Commons with Bill 148, an Act respecting the
New Westminster Harbour Commissioners
and to provide for the refunding of maturing
financial obligations.
The bill was read the first time.
SECOND READING

The Hon. the SPEAKER: When shall the
bill be read the second time?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON, by leave of the
Senate, moved the second reading of the bill.
He said: Honourable senators. there is
notbing of a contentious nature in this bill.
It simply provides for the refinancing of an
obligation which will mature on April 2, 1948.
As the bill must be passed by that date, I
would ask for the indulgence of the house to
give it second reading this afternoon.
I have asked the honourable senator from
Cariboo (Hon. Mr. Turgeon) to explain the
bill. Should further information be required
beyond that given in the explanation, I have
no objection to the bill being referred to the
Standing Committee on Banking and Commerce, or any other appropriate committee.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Before the honourable
member explains the bill, I should say that I
have read it and have no objection to it. If
it is the wish of honourable senators, I am
quite willing that it be passed today.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I will ask the
honourable senator from Cariboo (Hon. Mr.
Turgeon) to explain the bill.
Hon. J. G. TURGEON: As the honourable
leader of the government bas said, this bill
contains nothing of a contentious nature. Even
if it were contentions, I feel sure that on this
particular occasion honourable senators would
be happy to give it quick approval. This
happens to be the fifty-first anniversary of
the day when in New Westminster-from
which the harbour commission referred te in
the bill takes its name-there was born our
honourable colleague, Senator McKeen, who
came into the house last year.
Some Hon. SENATORS:

Carried!

Hon. Mr. TURGEON: The bill relates to
an obligation accepted by the Dominion
Government twenty years ago in connection
with the construction of a grain elevator at
New Westminster. New Westminster is not
one of the ports administered by the National
Harbours Board, but two of the three harbour
commissioners are appointed by the Dominion
Government. If, as the leader of the government bas said, it is the wish of honourable
senators that the bill be referred to the Banking and Commerce Committee, I shall be glad
to make the appropriate motion; but frankly
I do not think that it is necessary.
The purpose of the bill lias been explained
in the House of Commons. It provides for
the renewal of guarantees of $700,000, and at
a lower rate of interest than bas prevailed
during the past twenty years; and definite
assurance bas been given in connection with
this renewal that payment will be made only
in Canadian currency and not, as at present,
optionally in United States currency. I have
great pleasuire in urging the acceptance of the
bill.
The bill was read the second time.

PRIVILEGE
TREFLF.CTION

ON

SENATOR

On the orders of -the day:
Hon. T. D. BOUCHARD: Honourable senators, I risc on a question of privilege.
This xnorning I read in last night's press of
some insinuations made against my integrity
by Mr. Duplessis, the premier of the province
of Quebec, and his colleague, Mr. A. Talbot,
the Minister of Roads. As a member of the
Senate of Canada, I owe to my respeeted
cobleagues an cmpbatie denial of the implied
allégations.
The following tebegram was sent by me to
both ministers:
I have read this morning in last night's
Frenchi press that under the shicld of your
parliamentary immunilty you have cowardly as
well as f alsely insinuated that I personally
benefited in the sumn of eleven hundred dollars
when a Cadillac car was bought by the Roads
Department when I was a minister. If you are
a gentleman I invite you to lay your charge
directly outside the bouse, and I undertake to
clearly prove in our courts of justice that your
innuendos are pure calumny. You say that an
inquiry bas been held. That is a falsehood.
This is the flrst time that 1 have beard this
news. In a demnocratie country an inquiry cannot be held without the accusrd being summoned. Truc it is that for four years we in
Quebec bave been in a province where citizens.
rigbts no longer exist.
Even the man whom reactionaries chass as
"Encmy No. 1" of thc province of Quebec
bas a right to bis gond reputation. Truc, I amn
an enemy of fasciats and totalitarians of any
kind, but I arn the bcst fricnd of those 'n
whosc veins and hearts flows the same blood as
in mine. For them I have undertaken to
wage a war that may be long, but which will be
won in the due course of time. That battle
wihh be fought not under the seetional lilyand-blue Duplessis flag-the flag of mediaevah
France-but under the Canadian flag, whatcver
it may be.

SENATE

DAIRY INDUSTRY BILL
INQUIRY

On the Orders of the Day:
Hon. W. D. EULER: Before the Orders of
the Day are proceeded with, I should like to
direct an inquiry to the leader of the government. In this morning's Citizen I note an
article which says that the government is now
informed by the officers of the Department
of Justice, that it is not required by the Geneva
agreements to remove the ban on the importation of margarine. As this is in direct contradiction to a statement made in the Trade
Relations Committee by the government
officials who negotiated the agreements, I would
ask the leader of the government if he can tell
the senate which statement is correct?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I shall be delighted to endeavour to secure the necessary
information.
Hon. Mr. HOWARD:

After consultation.

BUSINESS OF TUE SENATE
On the Orders of the Day:
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: For the information of honourable senators, I may say that
it is my intention to move when the house
adjourns today that it stand adjourned until
Monday evening next at eight o'clock.
I have arranged for a meeting of the Banking and Commerce Committee on Tuesday
morning next, to consider the legislation
already before the committee and any other
business that may be referred to it in the
meantime. I also have 'taken the precaution
of suggesting that the committee on Natural
Resources meet on Wednesday morning, as it
is possible that some legislation which must
be passed at this session will have to go before
,that committee.
I am unable to say what other committees
may have to sit to transact the business coming before the house prior to the Easter recess,
which I understand is to commence Wednesday, March 24, but I shall advise the house
from time to time as I receive the necessary
information.
LOAN COMPANIES BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON moved second
reading of Bill F, an Act to amend the Loan
Companies Act.
He said: I have asked the honourable senator frorn Inkerman to explain this bill.

Hon. A. K. HUGESSEN: Honourable senators, this is a bill to amend the Loan Companies Act, which was originally enacted in
1914.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Before my honourable
friend proceeds further, may I ask him for
some information which will help me to understand the bill? Representations have been
made to me by a number of people who want
certain amendrments made to the bill. Is it
proposed to deal with such matters when the
bill is sent to committee?
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: I intend- to explain
those matters in the course of my remarks.
The Loan Companies Act, which is now
cited as Chapter 28 of the Revised Statutes
of 1927, was originally enacted by parliament
in the year 1914, for the purpose of governing
the operations of loan companies which had
been organized under federal enactrnent. It
was amended on two occasions, first in 1934
and again in 1939, but as the amendrments
were of a rather minor character I will not
detain the house to explain them. The amendments which are now proposed are sought as a
result of experience over the years, and with
the object of bringing the Act up to date.
Perhaps it would interest honourable members
if I were to mention the companies which are
now subject to the Loan Companies Act,
because they are the parties affected by this
legislation. There are only five such companies, but all of them are substantial and
important.
Hon. Mr. MORAUD: What happened
the otiers? Have they been merged?

to

Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: Some have been
merged in existing companies, and one or two,
I understand, have gone out of existence. In
1942 there were eight such companies; now
there are only five, but among them they
represent total assets of approximately $140
million. Their liabilities to the public are
$110 million, their paid-up capital is of the
order of $16,000,000, and their reserves amount
to $12.000,000; so they are of substantial
importance. The names of the five companies
and the locations of their head offices are as
follows: The Canada Permanent Mortgage
Corporation. Toronto; the Central Canada
Savings and Loan Company, Toronto; the
Eastern Canada Savings and Loan Company,
Halifax, the Huron and Erie Mortgage Corporation, London; and-the most recent-the
International Loan Company, Winnipeg.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: The capitalization of the
Internatiohal Loan Company is not the
largest.

277

MARCH 18, 1948
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: I do not think it
is. The company was organized about twentyfive years ago.
Hon. Mr. LESAGE: Is the London which
the honourable senator has referred to London, Ontario?
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: Yes. The amendments, although rather formidable in extent,
are somewhat inconsequential. Perhaps I
should indicate to the house the principal
changes which are desired.
The first change is to permit these companies to maintain an office elsewhere than at
their head office, for the purpose of effecting
stock transfers. This power of establishing
branch offices now resides in every company
which is organized by letters patent under
the Companies Act. There is a change in the
classes of investments in which such companies can invest their funds, in order to bring
the enumeration of such classes of investments more into line with amendments to the
Trust Companies Act which were made last
session. In particular, it is desired to permit
these companies to invest a certain proportion
of their funds in no par value shares of other
Canadian corporations; but there is the
limitation that not more than 15 per cent of
the total funds of any one company may be
invested in common stock.
Hon. Mr. CRERAR: That is a new power?
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: Yes; at least it is
an extended power. When, in April, 1914, the
Act was originally introduced, there were no
such things as no par value shares. The
amendment is simply to modernize the provisions with respect to investment in that
regard.
There are a few other provisions. The
companies are empowered to increase the
numbers of their boards of directors from
the present maximum of twenty-one to not
more than thirty. Boards of directors may
appoint executive committees of the directors.
With the necessary authorization of their
shareholders, companies may split their shares
into values of less than $100. At the moment
the unit is restricted to a minimum of $100.
There is a somewhat important provision
increasing the borrowing powers of such companies from six times to ten times the aggregate of their paid-up capital, reserves and cash.
This is the substance of the bill which is
now submitted to us. But as the honourable
leader of the opposition has remarked, since
the bill was printed a number of representations were made to the Superintendent of
Insurance by the Dominion Mortgage and
Investments Association, which is the -body
charged with looking after the interests of

these five companies. I understand that as a
result of conferences which have been held
between the association and the Superintendent of Insurance and his officials, certain
amendments, not of any great substance but
which have been agreed upon in principle
by the department and the association, are to
be suggested in committee for consideration
if the house should give second reading to this
measure. I am open to suggestions as to the
committee to which the bill should be sent.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Banking and Commerce.
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: Or should it go to
the Finance Committee? Primarily the matter
it deals with is a financial one. Perhaps the
honourable leader on this side will indicate to
which committee he thinks it desirable to have
it sent.

Hon. Mr. HAIG: The Banking and Commerce Committee will be sitting. As I understand it, when the bill is referred to the committee, a delegation representing the five
companies will have an opportunity to appear
before it.
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: Yes.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: One of their officers, a
great personal friend of mine, asked me about
a month ago to let him know when to attend.
I presume the companies' representatives will
be duly notified.
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: Oh, yes. The
whole matter has been discussed in the most
friendly spirit between the Superintendent
of Insurance and the representatives of the
Dominion Mortgage and Investments AssociationHon. Mr. HAIG: So I understood.
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: -and I understand
that they will appear before the committee
and suggest amendments which have been
worked out by them.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the second time.
REFERRED TO COMMITTEE

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Since the Banking and Commerce Committee will be in
session, I move that the bill be referred to
the Standing Committee on Banking and
Commerce.
The motion was agreed to.
CANADA SHIPPING BILL
SECOND READING

The Senate resumed from Tuesday, March
16, the debate on the motion for the second
reading of Bill E-5, an Act to amend the
Canada Shipping Act, 1934.

SENATE
Hon. WISHART McL. ROBERTSON:
Honourable senators, at the close of our discussion two days ago I asked the whip to
adjourn the debate because I thought some
honourable senators might wish to be heard.
There is no particular urgency for second reading today, but some time before the Easter
recess I should like to have the bill referred
to the Standing Committee on Transport and
Communications so that a date may be set
for the hearing of witnesses.
If no one wishes to speak now, I would ask
His Honour the Speaker to put the motion
for second reading.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: The question,
honourable senators, is on the motion for the
second reading of the bill. Is it your pleasure
to adopt the motion?
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the second time.
REFERRED TO COMMITTEE

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON moved that the bill
be referred to the Standing Committee on
Transport and Communications.
The motion was agreed to.
PENNY BANK BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. WISHART McL. ROBERTSON
moved the second reading of Bill R-S, an Act
to provide for the winding up of the Penny
Bank of Ontario and the repeal of the Penny
Bank Act.
Be said: Honourable senators, the object of
this bill is to wind up the Penny Bank of
Ontario, and to repeal the Act under which it
was incorporated. The purpose of the Penny
Bank was to encourage thrift by providing
school children with facilities, through their
teachers, for saving pennies. This bank has
been operating in Ontario since 1904, but
during the war it stopped accepting deposits in
order to avoid competing with the sale of
war savings certificates and stamps to school
children. The bank has not accepted any
deposit since 1942.
It is now felt that the scheme places a burden on the teachers that exceeds the benefits
arising from it, and the bank has requested
that legislation bo introduced to wind up its
affairs. Resolutions of the Board of Directors
of the Penny Bank of Ontario have been
passed, approving the procedure set out in the
bill. The Act itself is being repealed because
the Penny Bank of Ontario is the only bank
ever to be incorporated under it.

As of June 30, 1947, the financial position
of the bank was as follows:
Deposits and accrued interest ....
$164,483.00
Bonds and accrued interest ......
100,750.00
Cash on hand and on deposit ....
140,229.47
Guarantee fund (of which $3,100
paid in cash by members)
Surplus funds ..................

....

20,000.00
84,.495.47

Briefly, the bill provides that the winding
up shall be supervised by the Inspector
Gencral of Banks; that the bank shall realize
its assets and discharge its liabilities; that all
active accounts shall be transferred to the Post
Office Savings Bank; that all dormant accounts
of less than one dollar be extinguished; that
members be repaid their subscriptions to the
guarantee fund, and that any remaining funds
be given to the Hospital for Sick Children in
Toronto.
Accounts of less than one dollar which have
been dormant for at least five years number
50,000, and have a value of $28,000. Accounts
of more than one dollar which have been
dormant for at least five years number 13,000,
and have *a value of $51,046. The number
of all other deposits is 65,000, and the value
$85,438.
I do not know that I can say anything more
in explanation of this bill. I should be glad
to have it referred to the appropriate committee, if any honourable senator feels that
further information is desired.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the second time.
REFERRED TO COMMITTEE

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON moved that the
bill be referred to the Standing Committee on

CONTINUATION 0F TRANSITIONAL
MEASURES BILL
FIRST READING

Amessage was received from the House of
Commons with Bill 136, an Act te amend The
Continuation of Transitional Measures Act,
1947.
The bill was read the first time.
SECOND

READING

The Hon. the SPEAKER: When shall the
bill ho read the second time?
Hon. A. B. COPP: As honourable senators
are awvare, it is requisite that this important
bill pass through our bouse and receive Royal
Assent before the 3lst of this month. We
are nearing the date whoa wc hope te ad.iourn
for the Easter vacation, and I assume that the
bill wiil have te go before a committee for
fu-rther study and consideration.
Therefore,
with leave of the Sonate, I now move the
second reading.
This is a short bibi of onby one section. Its
purpose is te continue in force the present
Transitional Measures Act for a further period
of one year. It provides that the expiry date
of the Act be chianged from March 31, 1948,
te March 31, 1949, or sixty days after the
oponing of the firat session of parliament in
1949, whichever is the carlier. Lt aise provides,
as dees the Act, for a further possible extension by joint address of both bouses of
parliament, shouid that prove necessary.
I think it wibl ho generalby agroed that,
for the time heing, at least, certain of the
controis and orders under the Act are still
required. Se that honourable senators may
understand just what the situation is under
the Act, I have obtained for honourablo
senators lista-I think there is one on each
desk-showing the orders in council which
hiave been revoked, those which have been
partialiy revoked, and those which are stil
in force. Lt will ho remembercd that, when
this Act ivas before us last, year, there n'as
appended te it a list of fifty orders under the
Act. 0f those fifty orders, twenty-three have
been wholly revoked and the remaining
twenty-sevon are still in force, four of which
have been partially revoked. The text of
ail these orders was given in the office con-

solidation distributed to each senator when
the Transitional Measures Act was being considered a year ago. By going through the
consolidation and striking out the paragraphs
pertaining to the orders which have since been
revoked, as indicated in the iists distributed
tonight, honourabie senators may have a clear
picture of exactly what, controls are stili
operabive.
I do flot intend to speak in detail about the
various orders which parliamont is being
asked to extend for a furthcr period of time.
It is my hope that the bill, if it receives
second reading tonight, may ho referred to the
Standing Committee on Banking and Commerce, which is meeting tomorrow morning.
Honourable senators may then examine the
appropriate officiais on any of the orders in
which thev are particuiarly interested.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: Can the honourabie
senator givo us any assurance that this wili
býe the last time the government wili ask for
an extension of these powers?
Hon. Mr. COPP: I have not been in close
touch with the government; but we hope it
wiil be the Iast time.
Hon. JOHN T. HAIG: Honourabie se nators, 1 heartily agree with the honourable
acting leader of the government (Hon. Mr.
Copp) when he says that he would like to, got
this bill before a cummittee tomorrow morfiing in order that we may have an opportunity
to thoroughly consider it.
There is one part of the bill that I do not
like; and that is the proviso, by whichi the
Act could bo extended for another year. I
think that shouid be donc by a special Act,
and that the last part of section 1 should be
struck out. In reaiity it would not hurt the
bill, because it wouid continue in force until
March 1949, before which time there will have
te be a session of parliament. Then the Act
could ho extended again if necessary, and we
would be able te discuss the merits of the
case.
Tonighit I have committed te writing a few
thoughts-something I very seldom dobecause I want te emphasize one feature of
this bill in such a way that my words wiil net
I do net like controls
be misunderstood.
because I think they are contrary te the
principie of free enterprise. I am giad that
the goverament have taken off a considerabie
number of controis, but I criticize them for
net hai ing taken them off as quickly as they
might have donc. I am net goiag into any
detaji. but I do want te tniiph on rent control.
I couid speak without notes, but I would
rather follow my text.

MARCH 22, 1948

I have neyer believed in controls once the
war was over, and I do flot believe in tbem,
now. Those of us who lived through the First
World War remember that practically as soon
as that war was over the controls were taken
off. There was a fiurry for about a year and
then things settled down. Undoubtedly the
same would have happened this time.
Without dealing with every control, I want
to deal especially with rentai control. This is
positively the most iniquitous control that can
be imagined. You simply take from the owner
of bousing accommodation part of the value
of his propcrty, and give it to the tenant. If
in 1941 a tenant was renting for $60 a month
a bouse that cost $6,000, he is stili paying $60
a montb, although to build that bouse today
would cost $12,000. The answer is as plain
as the nose on your face. No bouses will be
built for rentai. Truce, I know that booses completed since January 1947 are flot under control, but tbey are only a small part of the
Canadian total; and practically none of these
bave been bujît for rentai.
I own a bouse in Winnipeg for wbicb the
tenant is paying $72 a montb. In 1939 be paid
$70; tberefore the rent in 1041 was frozen at
$70. 1 was allowed to increase tbe rent by the
arnount of the increase in taxes over those of
1939. In the case in question this amounted
to $2, so I arn getting $72. That bouse wouid
rent today-if the income return on the capital
valuation was based on today's cost-at $140
a month. Tbe tenant is well-to-do, in fact
mucb better off than the owner; but will he
buy a bouse? Not on your life. If he built
a bouse the cost of maintenance, interest,
taxes, insurance, etc., woold be equal to $140 a
montb, and be would bave just the rame
accommodation. The only person benefiting,
therefore, is the man wbo bappens to be tenant
of a property wbicb was built prior to the
lst of January, 1947.
Tbe record in every city in Canada and in
every one in the United States wbere a record
bas been mîade shows tbat the increase in
bousing units is proportionately greater than
the increase in population. Take Canada. Tbe
increase in population between 1940 and 1947
was about 18 per cent. Tbe number of bousing
units bas increased 24 per cent. Wby the
shortage? There are two reasons. iFirst, there
are fewer people living in each bousing unit
now, in 1948, than tbere were in 1940. Let me
illustrate-by my own experience. In 1940 there
were six people living in my bouse; today
tbere are two. I dare not take any tenants,
because it is practically impossible to get
tbem out. And there are bundreds, iiterally
thousands, of people in the same position as
Iarn.
5853-201

Wbat the government ougbt to do -witb tbis
control is to say "We will extend controls, not
tili the 31st of Marcb 1949, but to the MOh of
June 1949, and after that date there will be no
more control." Tbat would give the people
lots of opportunity to get new accommodation or to adjust tbemselves to the situation.
I could quote figures to no end. Listen to
tbis data. In 1939 there were in the Toronto
area 200,740 bousing units. In 1£47 there were
approximately 232,400. But wbat about the
population? Tbe Assessment Department of
that city sbows that in Greater Toronto there
were 869,000 people in 1939; in 1947 there were

994,000. The occupation ratio, therefore, in
1939 was 4-32; in 1947 it was 4-26. If the
4-32 ratio was applied to the existing bousing:
today tbere would be a surplus of 2,500 units.
Tbe data shows that the population increased
18 per cent, 'wbereas bousebolds or separate
establisbments increased 26 per cent. You say,
then wby are there not more places to rent?'
The answer is simply that tbe number Of
dwelliag units occupied by one person
increased by 69 per cent, and the number
occupied by two persons increased by 45 per
cent. Tbere are no vacancies. Yet, figures
show that 70,000 married couples in Toronto
now share the living accommodation of others,
as against 41,000 in 1940.

Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: May I ask the
honourable senator a question?
Do the
figures 4-32 and 4-26 indicate the number of
people living in each house?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: In eacb bousing unit. In
1939 there were 4-32 persons.
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: On an average?

Hon. Mr. HAIG: Yes. And in 1947 there
were 4-26. Tbe surprising tbing is that, as I
pointed out, the number of dwelling units
occupied by one person was 69 per cent
greater in 1947 than in 1940, and the number
occupied by two persons was 45 per cent
larger.
I could go on and give you figures to no,
end. Exactly the same thing happened in
Chicago.-I ýthink a nine per cent increase of
the population and a 1.7 per cent increase in
housing units-and it bappened for the same
reasofis.
This wbole scheme of rent control was tried
out in France after the first war, and it iýj
stili in existence, witb disastrous resoîts. Theý
same is true of Austria. Uniess people can
build properties for rentai and receive a
reasonable returo on tbeir money, none will
he but. There is no solution to the problem
except, to allow rentaI values to find their
proper level on the frce market.

SENATE

You may say that people in the lowerincome brackets cannot pay rentals. That is
because the fixed income is not large enough
to meet the present cost of building materials
and labour. As in the 1930's Canada and
support
countries had to
many other
unemployed, so it may be necessary during
this period of high prices for the dominion or
the provinces or the municipalities to subsidize the people in the lower-income brackets.
But that is another problem. Rental control
dioes not solve the problem-it bas always
made it worse.
The average cost of building today is about
200 per cent over what it was in 1940.
Hon. Mr. EULER: Surely, my friend does
not mean 200 per cent of an increase.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: It is double what it was
then. A house that cost $6,000 to build in
1940 will now cost $12,000.
Hon. Mr. EULER: That is a 100 per cent
increase.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Well, it is double the
value.
The rental controls up to January, 1947,
held rents down to what they previousl'y
were. People will say that from a political
standipoint
the proposition is dynamite,
because there are a thousand tenants to one
owner. But that bas never in any country
justified the controls which have had disastrous results. In my opinion the situation
instead of getting better is going to get worse.
In the city of Winnipeg, for instance, a
great many temporary houses have been built,
and the people are clamouring for the government to builýd a thousand homes for veterans. The cause of that demand, as I have
pointed out, is that on certain streets only
two or three people now live in houses where
once there were double that number. The
reason for that is clear: the owners cannot
get tenants out of their bouses. Every day
people are applying to our courts in an effort
to get rid of tenants, and they cannot get
them out.
I am one of those who believe that the
government should set a date for the termination of rental control. I suggest June 30,
because it comes in the middle of the summer
and is the best time for moving. If that were
to happen, I believe we would be surprised
at the number of people who would accept
the situation and prepare for it.
I do not propose to vote against the bill,
but I feel very strongly that the sooner the
government recognizes that rental control dues
not solve anything, the better it will be for
the people who want accommodation

Hon. T. A. CRERAR: Honourable senators,
I have only a few brief observations to make
on the motion for second reading of this
measure. While I think it necessary that the
controls bu extended for another year, I
rather agree with the honourable leader
opposite, that if a further extension is necessary it should be made by means of a new
bill and not by an address. That, however,
is a matter that can be discussed when the
bill is before the committee.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: Will the honourable
gentleman permit a question? What is the
difference between the two methods of proIn either case the measure would
cedure?
have to go before both bouses of parliament.
Hon. Mr. CRERAR: That is quite true,
but I believe a bill is somewhat more formidable than a resolution.
I do not like these controls. I believe that
by next year, four years after the war, it
should be possible to get clear of the emergency powers now vested in the government.
These things have a habit of sticking, and the
longer they continue the more difficult they
are to get rid of. I have no hesitation in
saying that I should like te see the end of
them.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the second time.
REFERRED TO COMMITTEE

Hon. Mr. COPP moved that the bill be

CANADIAN

WHEAT BOARD BILL

FIRST READING

A message was received from the House of
Commons with Bill 135, an Act to amend
The Canadian Wheat Board Act, 1935.
The bill was read the first time.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: When shall the
bill bu read the second time?
Hon. Mr. COPP: Honourable senators, for
the same reasons that I gave with regard to
the bill which lias just received second reading, I ask the approval and consent of the
Senate to have this bill placed on the order
paper for second reading at the next sitting
of the bouse.

MARCH 22, 1948
Hon. NORMAN P. LAMBERT: Honourable senators, before that recommendation is
adopted, may I point out that the rules of
the house require two days' notice of the
second reading of a bill so that due time can
be given to the study of it. I know that,
upon the consent of the house, it is customary
to conisider second reading at the next follo-wing sitting. I personally would prefer that, in
accordance with the rules, two days' notice be
given of the consideration of this bill. In my
opinion it is of such an important character,
and has received such inadequate attention in
the other place, that it is the duty of the
Senate and of the standing conimittee to which
it will be referred to give it very thorough
consideration.
There are various phaszes of this bill which
I think make it ail the more necessary for us
to examine it carefuily. I would particularly
mention the hast part of the bill, relating
to oats and barley, which involves the co-operation of the provinces in proposed complementary legislation. I observed in a western
newspaper the report that the premier of one
of the provinces has addressed a request to the
minister in the other place for more information and certain assurances in connection with
this measure. For this reason I believe for
one thing that the correspondence of the
premiers of the provinces concerned with the
minister should be tabled, ýso that we shahl
have fuil opportunity to, know w*hat will be
the attitude of the hegisiatures and governments of the provinces affected. For that
reason, and others which I will not elaborate,
I would like to sec fuit consideration given
to this bill.
I am willing to concur in the opinion of the
Senate as to whether one day or two days
will be sufficient for this purpose; but the
standing committee which has -this legisiation in baud should be fully informed with
regard to it. I do not think this measure
should be rusbed through merely because the
bouse desires to adjourn on a certain date. If
necessary, this bill could be carried over until
after the adjournment without any barm being
done.
Hon. T. A. CRERAR: I support the suggestion of the honiourable senator fromn Ottawa
(Hon. Mr. Lambert). This bill is a very
important one; let there be 110 mýisunderstanding about that. In at least four material
particulars it amends the Wheat Board Act.
I hoped to have a copy of the bill last weekend in order to study it, but I was unable to
procure one until about 3 o'cIock this afternoon, when the bill in its third reading form
came from the printer's. I do not believe it

283

is possible to have this measure put through
ail its stages, and receive Royal Assent before
we adjouru on Wednesday evening. Moreover, certain. interests affeeted by the bill
should have an. opportunity to come here and
present their views.
As bonourable senators know, the bill provides for certain payments to wbeat growers
in, the prairie country of money wbich belongs
to themn and which the Wheat Board has in
band. There can be no possible objection to
that part of the measure. Further, there iw
provision for a pension plan. This requiressonie scrutiny: it indicates an expectation that
this Wheat Board machinery is to be a permanent feature of our Canadian econ-omy..
There is also provision for an extension of the
powers of the Wheat Board in dealing with.
wheat products, such as flour, bran, shorts and
breakfast foods. These sections, I think,
require rather close examination. I ain assuredt.
that one of the milling compan-ies interested iut
the manufacture of wheat products desires to,
make representatione to the committee upon
this matter. But what I regard as the most
obj ectionable feature of the bill, and one
which I cannot bring myseif to support, is the
section which puts oats and barley-coarse
grains--enitirely under the control of the
Wheat Board, irrespective of the wishes of the
individual fanmer. That section is simply an
extension to oats and 'barley of the present principle of marketing wheat. I might recall tbat
previous amendments to the Wheat Board Act
were justified on the ground that the board
must be clothed with the powers neoessary to
implement the four-year wheat agreement
which the government had made with the
United Kingdom. There can be no possible
justification of that kind, or any other kind,
for putting oats and barley under the absolute
control of the Wheat Board; and as far as 1
am concerned-and I make no bones about
it-4 am. whohly opposed to that provision.
These are the reasons whieh make it impossi-ble to deal with this bill in a hasty fashion.
This measure should receive most careful sorutiny, and as far as I am concerned- I shahl
support the honourable senator from Ottawa
(Hon. Mr. Lambert). I think we should have
at lest a couple of days to study this bill
before being asked to discuss it on second
reading.
Hon. Mr. COPP: Honourable senators, like'my honourable friend from Churchill (Ho0n..
Mr. Crerar) I wouhd be out of order to speakon this matter now. His remarks related to theprinciphe of the bill, the second reading of
which bas not yet been moved. I onhy suggested that we might consider it tomorrow,
when, if we were not ready to proceed, it couhd
be stood over again.

SENATE

On behalf of the honourable leader of the
government I want ta assure honourable senators that I have no desire to rush this bill
through the house in any way, shape or form.
I had thought that we might give it second
reading tomorrow and. if the debate did not
prove to be too long, that we could get it to
committee and perhaps have it returned to us
before the Easter recess. This suggestion was
only made for the consideration of the bouse.
I know the bill is an important one. I should
like to learn something about the grain trade,
for I know nothing about wbeat growing or
wheat selling.
Hon. Mr. CRERAR: Honourable senators, I
did not attempt to make a speech such as I
will make on the second reading of this bill, if
my voice permits. I sinply wanted to point
out same of the reasons why I regard this as
a very important measure and why we should
have sufficient time to study it before second
reading.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Is there any necessity for
passing this bill before we adjourn for the
Easter recess?
Hon. Mr. COP-P: My understanding is
that it is not imperative, but I do think the
government desires to get these provisions
passed in order to make participation payments to the farmers, who are anxious to have
them for use in their seeding operations in
the near future.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: Objection has
been taken. Second rcading on Wednesday

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Honourable senators, with respect to the recent inquiry by the
honourable senator from Waterloo (Hon. Mr.
Euler), I may say that because of my
unavoidable absence from the house yesterday
and part of this morning I have not secured
the information he requested. I shall, however, endeavour to do so at the earliest possible moment.
SUSPENSION OF RULES
NOTICE OF MOTION

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I beg to give
notice that tomorrow I will move:
That for the balance of the present month
Rules 231, 24 and 63 be suspended.
I give this notice in pursuance of the practice
of this house when adjournment and Royal
Assent are about to take place. The suspension will apply until the commencement of the
Easter recess. I may add for the information
of honourable senators, that any powers which
flow from this suspension of the rules will not
be applicable to an important piece of legislation which came before the bouse in my
absence, and concerning which there is a time
factor. The motion relates to the general
business of the bouse, with that specific
exception.
Hon. Mr. CRERAR: Does my honourable
friend refer to the Wheat Bill?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Yes.
CANADIAN

WHEAT BOARD BILL

MOTION TO RESCIND ORDER

On Notices of Inquiries and Motions:
Hon. WISHART MeL. ROBERTSON:
Honourable senators, before the Orders of the
Day are reached, may I say a word about
Order No. 1 for tomorrow?
I was unavoidably absent from the house
yesterday, but I knew the continuation of
Transitional Measures bill and the Canadian
Wheat Board bill would reach this bouse last

evening, and it was my hope that when I
returned some progress wold have been
made with these measures. In discussing the
matter with the deputy leader (Hon. Mr.
Copp) this morning I learned that the Transitional Measures bill was then being considered
in committee-it has since been passed-and
I expressed the hope that the Senate would
see fit to proceed with the second reading of
the Wheat Board bill this afternoon, with the
expectation that it would be put rhrough before
the date set for adjournment.
I have read with interest the discussion
which took place in the house yesterday, and
I believe that the deputy leader took the
right attitude towards this matter at that
time. The usual practice of the Senate has
been to waive, by unanimous consent, the
rules which require a lapse of two days before
a bill can be given second reading. Of course
any honourable senator who sees fit is
entitled to object, and it was in consequence
of such an objection that the Wheat Board
bill was placed on the order paper for second
reading tomorrow.
Whatever desire there may be on the part
of the government to have this measure passed
at as early a date as possible, it is not in the
same category as the Transitional Measures
bill, which expires on March 31, and which
obviously must be dealt with at once if parliament is to adjourn tomorrow to a date subsequent to March 31. I had hoped that all
matters now before us for consideration would
be dealt with this week, because that would
have provided me with an excellent reason for
advising the Senate that it will not be necessary for us to resume on April 5, when, I
understand, the House of Commons intends
to reassemble; but I would not want the
Canadian people to imagine that we take
adjournments at the expense of the business
of this country.
It is obvious that if there is no work before
us and no reasonable likelibood of any, the
length of our Easter adjournment can be regulated accordingly. I am therefore a little disappointed at the indication that we cannot
proceed today with at least a discussion of the
Wheat Bill. But I am entirely in the hands of
the Senate. I realize the importance of the bill;
I recognize that there are honourable senators
who have strong views about certain parts of
it; I do not intend to ask the bouse to do
otherwise than to make use of any time which
may be reasonably available for consideration
of the measure. I shall not attempt to urge
honourable senators to deal hastily with
this legislation because adjournment is imminent. There is nothing in the world to prevent us from coming back at the same time as

MARC-H 23, 1948
the House of Commons, and giving immediate
consideration to the 'bill, and then taking whatever adjournment rnay seern fitting; but I arn
sure honourable senators agree with me that
we should not contemplate a lengthy adi ournment while important unfinished business
remains before us.
Now, despite the good reasons to the contrary which were given, yesterday, I arn going
to ask the býouse to consider the advisability
of going aheadi with the Wheat Bill this afternoon.
Hon. Mr. DUFF: Quite right. Go ahead.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: In so doing, I
do not suggest that the debate should be
terminated today. That is for honourable
senators te decide. But as no business rernains
for our attention beyond that which is set
diown for this afternoon, or this evening, 1
say quite frankly that I should like to see as
rnuch progress as possible made beýfore we go
home. In saying that I arn not to be understood as objecting to giving ail the tirne whicb
is necessary to the considieration of this legislation. I arn prepared to corne to this capital and
stay here, if need be, continuously; and I
believe that sentiment is shared by ail honourable senators. If there were unaýnirnous consent, I would move for leave to have considared thîs afternoon the matter which is set
down for tornorrow afternoon. It could then
be proceeded with. Otherwise, the matter
will have to take its course and be dealt with
tomorrow afternoon, and from then on as circumstances demand.
Hon. JOHN T. HAIG: Honourable rnerbers, corning as I do from. one of the more
distant provinces, I arn rnuch disturbed by the
implications of the government leader's statement. I arn quite willing to lie here: indeed
this year I have missed only one day. The
open.ing day came on a Friday, and I did not
feel, inclined to corne here for the Friday session and stay around on Saturday and Sunday.
I wish honourable senators to realize clearly
my position in this matter. The arnendrnents
to the Canadian ýWheat Board Act are of great
interest, especially to the three prairie
provinýces. I.f we do not consicher the bill
before adjourning, it wilI stand over and we
shaîl have to corne back to discuss it on April
5. 1 arn quite willing to do that rnyself,
but I amn afraid that we would net have a
representative opinion because sorne memnbers
would nlot feel hike coming back on the 5th
April for three or four days' work.
The situation now is this: the In'tcrirn Supply bull and the Supplernentary Supply bull
will probably corne over frorn the other bouse
tomorrow; it, will not take long to pass those

287

bis; then, as there will be nothing else
coming from the other house at an early date,
we shall have nothing to do for a long tirne.
I know that honourable senators who, live, outside of On'tario an, Quebec would appreciate
a ri'ssonable adijourrrment at this time of
year. Whether we like it or not, we have to
make out our incomne tax statements before
the end of April, and if one is in business it is
a considjerable problern to get in ail the
exemptions to which one is entitled, and it
takes a great deal of time, and co-ordination
with the office to complete the return.
I earnestly appeal to the honourable gentleman who objected last night to reconsider the
matter now and decide whether they cannot go
on with the debate. I know that if the honoeurable leader moves second reading of the bill, 1
shall have some uncomplimentary things to say
about it, which may stir up sorne oppositi'on;
but I ara, prepared to speak, and for the good
of the Senate would urge that we proceed with
the debate. It should be remernbered that the
Senate meets only three days a week and that
for the remaining four days those of us who
corne from far away places have to sit around
with nothing to do. It is true that a few of
us who serve on the Divorce Com.mittee are
able to consume a lot of tirne in hearing divorce
peti-tions, but 1 can assure honourable senators
that that is nlot a very pleasant occupation, to
say the least.
There may lie some new points in this bill
which relate to. oats and barley, but the fundamental proposition behind wheat or grain control is nlot new, and lies been fully discussed
over the last two years. I would therefore urge
the bouse to accede to the suggestion of the
leader of the governrnent, and try to get on
with the bill now.
Hon. Mr. MORAIJD: What is the urgency
of it?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: The urgency lies in the
second part of the bill, wherein the governrnent
proposes to pay out an additional advance to
persons who have sold wheat to the Wheat
Board. The original arnount paid out to a
wheat producer, upon the wheat being delivered
to the elevator, was $1.35 per bushel, less freight
and caMring charges. It is now proposed, to
increase this arnount by twenty or twenty-five
cents. In other words, a farmer from Alexander,
Manitoba, who deiivered, say, a thousand
bushels of wheat to the Wheat Board, would
receive twenty cents a bushel. This provision
would be very useful to the farrners at this time
of the year, but it will have te be carried out
before April 15. 1 have no objection to this
provision, but I should have liked to see the
bill divided so that oats and barley would have

SENATE

been dealt with separately. If this had been
done no difficulty would have been encountered,
and sections 1, 2 and 3 of the bill as now hefore
us could have been passed. Though I would
make minor objections to these sections, I
would vote for them; but I cannot vote for
section 4, and I feel it will be fully discussed.
I do not think the bill can be divided now, so
I would urge that we get on with the
discussion.
Hon. NORMAN P. LAMBERT: Honourable senators, as I was responsible yesterday
for suggesting observance of the rule requiring
two days' notice before the bill is discussed on
second reading, I should like to point out my
main reason for so doing.
During the course of my brief remarks
yesterday I intimated that the position of the
provinces is very definitely involved in this
legislation, and I made reference to correspondence which had been conducted between the
provincial premiers and the minister in charge
of this bill. In this connection I suggested
that the correspondence should be tabled for
our information.
In pursuance of this point I should like to
read an extract from a report which appeared
in the Winnipeg Free Press last Thursday. It
reads as follows:
It is known that many members of this predominantly farmer coalition are uneasy about
the policy which may be followed by the board
should the proposed legislation act at Ottawa
become law. For this reason the government,
it was learned Wednesday, bas sent a letter to
Right Hon. C. D. Howe, Minister of Trade and
Commerce, who is in charge of the bill.
The letter enquires as to the precise nature
of the amendments. It seeks a direct answer
to the question whether the board would use its
marketing authority to prevent western oats
and barley growers from receiving the highest
possible return for their products that is,
whether the board would tend to favour feeders
of livestock and poultry in this country, by
keeping prices down to the prairie growers and
barring them from possibly more lucrative
iaikets elsewhere.
If satisfactory answers are received to these
questions, there would appear to be more chance
of complementary legislation being acceptable to
a majority of the entire coalition.
Certainly the tabling of these two letters for
the enlightenment of this house would have a
definite bearing on the attitude of honourable
senators towards this bill on second reading.
Hon. T. A. CRERAR: Honourable senators,
as one who last evening raised some objection
to this bill may I be permitted to say a word
or two, though really, I think, our whole
discussion at the moment is out of order.
Honourable senators, it seems to me rather
extraordinary to suggest-I do not think that
is putting it too strongly-that it is desirable

to dispose of this bill before the Senate
adjourns tomorrow. The honourable leader
of the opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig) bas pleaded
that it is necessary to get the payments that
will be made under this bill into the hands of
the farmers' by April 15, if possible. In reply
to that argument I say that any person who is
aware of the situation knows that that is not
possible. First the government has to determine, on the advice of the Wheat Board,
what payments will be made. When that has
been done, the Wheat Board has to calculate
the payments to be made covering the accounts
of every farmer-probably 300,000-who has
marketed wheat during the last three years.
The urgency that the honourable leader of
the opposition contends for is just not there.
This is an important bill, and there are some
of us who feel very strongly about certain of
its sections. Frankly, I do not think it is
possible to put it through before the Senate
adjourns tomorrow night, and I do net think
we should attempt it, even though our failure
to do so might mean that we have to come
back on April 5 to consider the bill further.
And may I say in passing that I do not see
the urgency for coming back then, either.
People who are going to be vitally affected
by legislation of this kind should have an
opportunity to come and present their views
upon it if they so desire. Surely we have not
reached the point where important legislation
of this nature, which takes away an individual's freedom to market his oats and barley
as he sees fit, is to be railroaded through
without giving opponents a chance to object
to it. I really think that would be a most
remarkable procedure, and I should like to
suggest to the leader of the government that
since the bill cannot be put through before
we adjourn tomorrow night, without unseemly
haste, its consideration should be postponed
until after the Easter recess. And, I say again,
it is not necessary for the Senate to come back
on the 5th of April to proceed with this
legislation.
Hon. Mr. DUFF: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. CRERAR: The government has
had plenty of time to bring the bill down
before now. I do not wish to be critical of the
government; but I would point out that
parliament assembled on December 5 last,
and that we are now near the end of March.
There have been nearly three full months of
parliamentary sittings during which this
measure could have been brought before us.
Some eight or nine days were spent on discussing it in another place.
Hon. A. L. BEAUBIEN: Longer than that.

MARCH 23, 1948
Hon. Mr. CRERAR: Are we sirnply to
rubber-starnp it now? If we do, we shall certainly be inviting the sort of critieîsrn that has
been directed against the Senate frorn one
end of the country to the other in the past,
that it is sirnply a rubber-starnp and of nu
importance. So far as I arn concerned, I arn
against putting the bill through before we
adjourn, and I would respectfully suggest to
the leader of the goverinent that it be allowed
to stand until the Senate reassembles, when we
could take it up in a fair, business-like and
orderly manner, and give the people who rnay
have something to say on it an opportunity
Vo corne here and say it. I arn sure that I arn
well within the judgment of the house when I
say that no senator would want to shirk his
responsibility on a rneasure of this kind in
order that he might enjoy three or four days
more of an Easter recess.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Frorn what I
have heard, I take it that rny honourable
friend would objeet to a motion to proceed
with second reading today.
Hon. Mr. HARDY: Yes.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I have simply
been trying to explain as clearly as I can what
the situation is, and I thought that in the
circumstances we could perhaps make some
progress with the bill today. However, I arn
perfectly willing to proceed in whatever way
the Senate wîshes. I see no reason why the
rnotion for second reading could flot be made
tornorrow, and then any senator who wished
to adjourn the debate could do so. Whatever
course is followed will make no difference to
me, but I do not want to be placed in a position where I arn not doing everything that I
can to facilitate the work of the house. I am
of course bound by the wishes of the Senate,
and I take it that rny honourable friends would
object Vo rny rnoving the second reading today.
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: I arn not objecting
to that, but I should like to have sorne assurance that the correspondence which I have
mentioned will be asked for and tabled, for
the enliglteamnent of this house. That correspondence lins a very direct bearing upon the
bill.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: There was no
formai motion for production of the correspondence, and I rnust confess that I had not
noticed my friend's request. I do not know
that there is such correspondence, but I shall
be very happy to inquire about it and to get
it, if possible. I certainly cannot get it today,
and 1 do not know if 1 could get it for tornorrow. I have made no inquiries whatever

289

about it. Unfortunately I did not get back
from Montreal until just after twelve o'clock
today. It seerns Vo me that the only way in
which we can make progress with the matter
today is by my moving the second readingand of course any member who se desires rnay
object to that.
Hon. Mr. CRERAR: Assurning that we proceed with the motion for tbe second reading
today, is it the leader's desire that we cornplete the discussion and refer the bill to comrnittee, so as to have it back here for assent
tomorrow?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I frankly say that
the gooner I can get legisiation through, the
better I like it; but I am not asking any
senator Vo forgo any right or privilege whicb
-appears to hirn to be -a rteasonable one to
exercise. The charge that the government is
slow in getting legislation over to the Senate
is an old one. Also, there is an old saying
that the governrnent proposes and the opposition disposes. As there was not much business on our order paper this afternoon, I
thought that we rnight make sorne progress
with -the bill. That is the situation.
Hon. A. L. BEAUBIEN: Honourable
senators, rnay I make a suggestion? If the
Senate were to give unanimous consent to the
making of the motion for second reading this
afternoon, and if that motion were carried, the
bill could be considered in cornrittee tomorrow,
when the correspondence desired by rny
honourable friend from Ottawa (Hon. Mr.
Lambert) could be produced. Like some
other senators, I arn noV enamnoured of certain
features of the bill; but if it is flot suitably
amended in comni'ttee there can be further
debate on the motion for third reading. On
the other hand, if the objectionable features
are removed in committee, we can have third
reading before the Easter adjournrnent.
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: Honourable rnembers, may 1 he al'lowed to add one word? If
it were not for the fact that the correspondence
to which I have referred is very pertinent te
the decision that we will have te make when
we corne te vote on the motion for second
reading, I would agree cornpletely and at once
with the honourable leader's request to proceed with second reading today. I would have
te, vote against the bill'in its present forrn,
hecause the hast part of it is fundarnentahly
contrary in principhe Vto what I believe in.
And rnay I say again that I think the correspondence te, which I have referred, which sets
forth the viewpoint of the provinces on the

SENATE

bill, and of one province in particular, would
have a decided effect upon the opinion of
the house.
Has that correHon. Mr. DAVIES:
spondence been considered in another place?
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: I do not think it was
asked for there.
Hon. A. L. B.EAUBIEN: Yes, it was asked
for, and I understand the minister said he
would request permission of the provinces to
table it.
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: I think this chamber
is peculiarly obligated te consider the position
of the provinces in relation ta this measure.
just as it would in relation to any other that
would call for complementary action on the
part of the provincial legislature. It is because
of the Senate's traditional obligation in a
matter where the provinces are concerned
that I am taking this point of view.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: I would call the
honourable gentleman's attention te the fact
that there is nothing before the Chair.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I apologize te His
Honour the Speaker.
May I offer this suggestion: that I make my
motion and briefly explain the bill, and that
while honourable senators proceed with the
discussion I absent myself fromn the chamber
and endeavour to ascertain whether such
correspondence is in existence, and if so, when
it can be tabled? Should the results of my
inquiry not appeal te my honourable friend, he
can then exercise his right te adjourn the
debate. Whether or not that suggestion is an
agreeable one is for the house to decide.
With leave of the Senate I move that the
order for the second reading of Bill 135, an
Act te amend the Canadian Wheat Board Act,
1935, which appears on the Order Paper for
Wednesday, March 24, be rescinded.
Sone Hon. SENATORS: Carried.
The motion was agreed te.
SECOND READING

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON moved the second
reading of Bill 135, an Act te amend the
Canadian Wheat Board Act, 1935.
He said: Honourable senators, as my honourable friends the senator from Churchill (Hon.
Mr. Crerar) and the senator from Ottawa
(Hon. Mr. Lambert) have pointed out, this
is a most important bill. It is so important
that in attempting te explain it I feel more
than my usual inability. Had circumstances
permitted, this is one of the occasions when

it might have been desirable te have ministers
who are thoroughly acquainted with ail the
details and ramifications of the measure,
come here from the other place and give their
explanations. They could do much better than
I shall ever hope te do. Indeed, I have a feeling that because there are sections of the bill
about which honourable senators hold very
strong views, any contribution I can make wil
probably not afford them half as much
information as they already possess. 'It seems
te me, therefore, that the less I say the better.
If the bill is referred te committee at the
earliest possible moment, the ministers concerned can come and supply any information
required. I am sure that they can make a
much greater contribution te the consideration
of the details of this very difficult question
than I can. Like my honourable friend from
Lunenburg (Hon. Mr. Duff), I came from the
Atlantic coast and know very little about
wheat. Fish is our specialty.
This bill contains four amendments which
are for the followi.ng purposes: (a) te make
provision for pensions for members, officers
and employees of the Wheat Board; (b) te
provide authority te increa-se the fixed minimum price of $1.35 and to 'make corresponding increases in payments te producers who
have delivered, or will deliver, wheat te the
board within the five-year pool period; (c)
te extend te wheat products the control of
interprovincial movements of wheat; and (d)
te empower the Governor in Council, by regulation, te extend te oats or barley the regulations now applicable te wheat.
I am indebted te the honourable leader
opposite and other honourable senators for
elucidating se many of the points involved in
this question. As a result, I feel that my
duty is a simple one.
As to the first amendment, I may say that
although the board has been in existence since
1935, there bas never been any pension scheme
for its employees, as there is for most government personnel. It is now proposed te set up
a pension fund for this group, half of which
would be contributed by the employees, the
other half being charged te the Wheat Board
as an operating expense. The number of
employees se covered would be about 457, and
the annual cost te the board would be around
$78,400.
The second amendrment empowers the government te pay a higher initial payment for
wheat sold te the five-year pool than the
present figure of $1.35. As a result of the
operations of the Wheat Board during the first
two and a half years of the pool, there will be,
when the 1947 crop operations have been con-

MARCH 23, 1948
pleted, a substantial surplus of about $234
million. The amendment would permit the
accumulated funds to be paid out more
rapidly to the farmer, by the setting of a
higher initial price than at present. The
bill does not stipulate an exact figure for the
new price; instead, it leaves the government
free to raise the price in accordance with the
financial prospects of the five-year pool, which
of course can change considerably in the last
two years of the pool. This degree of flexibility in setting the minimum payment for
wheat sold to the board is expected to assist
in giving the farmer full compensation for his
wheat in the shortest possible time.
The third amendment has to do with extending the Wheat Board's regulations, so as to
cover wheat products as well as wheat. In the
past the lack of such a provision has left a
serious loophole. Farmers could sell to the
flour mills at a price higher than the initial
payment of the Wheat Board, and thus deprive
the five-year pool of a part of its revenue.
This was unfair to farmers who sold their
wheat to the board at the official price.
The final amendment proposes to empower
the Governor in Council, by regulation, to
extend to oats and barley the system now
employed in handling wheat. The government has been under strong pressure from
farmers' organizations to make it possible for
the board to take over the marketing of oats
and barley. Although there are serious constitutional doubts a to the power of the
federal government to undertake this measure,
the government is asking that this permissive
section be included in the bill. Then if a
workable scheme for marketing these products
through the Wheat Board can be agreed upon
by the producers and the provincial governments concerned, and the provinces pass the
necessary complementary legislation, the
Dominion Government will be in a position
to decide whether or not such a plan should
be put into effect.
There is no technical factor involved in this
legislation, such as the expiry date which
applied to the Continuation of Transitional
Measures bill. The argument for early action
is that the sooner the measure receives parliamentary assent, the sooner the payments
will reach the farmers concerned. Some honourable senators have pointed out the importance of the legislation. I feel that if we
proceed with it, and utilize all the time available to the best advantage, no one can find
fault with us. I certainly would not urge any
other action.
I do not think I can add much to what I
have already said in the course of this

explanation. As this bill pertains to agriculture, I would suggest, if the house sees fit to
give it second reading, that it be referred
to the Standing Committee on Natural
Resources. I have the consent of my colleagues to the attendance of witnesses, includ,ing any who signify a special wish to be
present; and I am quite willing to let the
matter take its course in accordance with the
customary practice.
Hon. Mr. JOHNSTON: That might take
up considerable time. If we are going to
bring witnesses here from various parts of
Canada, we may be here for a week or two.
With due deference, it seems to me that the
better course would be to send this bill to
Committee of the Whole, where every person
would have the opportunity of saying something about it.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I suggested that
the bill be referred to the Standing Committee
on Natural Resources because I thought that
in all probability the committee would welcome the attendance of those of my colleagues
who have a special degree of knowledge and
experience of these matters. But I am willing
to agree with any suggestion which has the
approval of the Senate.
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: A year ago, when
the amendment of the Wheat Board Act
was before us, the question of reference to the
appropriate committee came up and it was
decided, I believe, to refer it to the Committee on Banking and Commerce on the
ground that it very definitely dealt with a
subject of commerce rather than of agriculture and production. The bill which is before
us today is the result of the work which was
done in that committee. I think it was generally agreed last year that the personnel of the
committee included nearly everyone with any
particular knowledge of or special interest in
the subject. I would ask the government leader
if he would consider again referring it to that
committee.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: On these matters
I have an open mind. Generally I get into
more trouble by reason of referring matters to
the Committee on Banking and Commerce
than for not doing so. I endeavoured to
determine in my own mind whether this bill
related more to agricultural than to financial
interests, and it was my humble judgment that
it pertained particularly to agriculture. It did
not seem to me that any interest would be
prejudieed by reference of the bill to the
Committee on Natural Resources, because the
honourable senator for Churchill (Hon. Mr.
Crerar), who presides over that committee,

SENATE

would give it the advantage of his experience
and knowledge. But I am not unwilling to
consent .to the reference of the bill to the
Banking and Commerce Committee. I have
such implicit confidence in the chairmen and
the members of both committees that either
committee will be satisfactory to me.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: The leader of the
government referred to the pension fund
contemplated in this bill. He said that the
board and the employees would contribute to
the fund on a 50-50 basis. Where does he find
that in the bill? As I read it, the board ara
given unlimited powers to pay out of their
funds into a pension fund, but there is no
indication of any plan or any limitation of
the amount which they may pay.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: At the moment I
cannot answer my honourable friend's question. It is my impression that the information
conveyed to me was compiled from statements
made by the minister in the other place. My
honourable friend's question would be a very
pertinent one to put to the minister. I am
not in a position to answer it.
Hon. JOHN T. HAG: I shall not delay
the house at any great length. I thank the
leader of the government for his explanations:
I can quite understand his position. If we were
talking about fish I would be as much at
sea as he is on the question of grain.
The bill as he outlined it covers four
matters. Dealing first with the establishment
of a pension soheme, I agree with my honourable friend from Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr.
Roebuck) that the intentions in this respect
are not very clearly defined, and I am not
going to deal with the subject except to say
that the Wheat Board is as much a government
organization as the Transport Board or any
other creation of parliament or of the government, and if its employees are to be pensioned they should be pensioned by the people
of Canada and not by the farmers who produce
the grain.
To the next item, the provision for increased
payment to producers, there can be no objection. The purpose is merely to pay the farmer
some money, over and above $1.35 per bushel,
which he expected to get, under the provisions
of the original Act, at the end of five years.
At present, instead of paying the farmer $1.35
a bushel upon delivery of the grain at the
car point in the rural area, he is paid the net
amount remaining after the deduction of
freight charges from that point to Fort
William or Vancouver, and elevator and all
other charges. The price of $1.35 is for No. 1
Northern. The price is less for the lower

grades, but for the most part the returns
amount to $1.10 to $1.20 per bushel, varying
with the points of delivery.
The next section bas to do with wheat products, and presents more difficulty. In general,
what happens is this. In the rural parts of
Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta wheat is
delivered to the mills, and when the flour is
shipped to the pool the offal or bran has been
sold locally to the farmers. This situation will
be entirely changed. In other words, instead
of limiting our regulation to the handling and
selling of wheat to the world, we are to apply
this technique to the producer at home. You
can decide whether Jim Brown is to have
twenty chickens or only ten, because you can
give him only enough middlings to feed ten.
I object to that regulation. It is an extension
of the controls which now affect the farmer's
right in his wheat.
The next question is much more important.
I am very glad that the leader of the government (Hon. Mr. Robertson) raised the constitutional question. I believe the framers
of this bill have gone at it wrong way round.
I think that if legislation was required, the
provinces should have passed it first. The
pools or similar organizations in the provinces
could have chosen the Wheat Board as their
agent, and could have sold through it; but
under this bill there is no choice, the Wheat
Board becomes the principal agent, and each
province is to be asked for ratifying legislation.
I am very doubtful if a province can give
that kind of ratification; and I am sure that
the province from which I have the honour
to come will be very loath to give any kind
of ratification. The young man who is premier
of Manitoba is a keen politician, and certainly
he knows that his province is not in favour
of this kind of legislation. That fact explains
the item in the Winnipeg Frec Press which my
honourable friend from Ottawa (Hon. Mr.
The .inquiries which have
Lambert) read.
come forward indicate, in my judgment, that
as far as our province is concerned there are
some misgivings about the content and purpose of this legislation. There will be no
objections from the Government of Saskatchewan: this legislation is right down their
alley. They believe in the sort of thing which
is being attempted in Great Britain, a regime
of "control", "control", "control". Over there
the Labour party told the people that if they
were returned to power the workers would
get more money for fewer bours of work.
That proposition is now being tried out; and if
Britain does not recover quickly-and the
Marshall plan can carry it for only a little
while-the end will be national bankruptcy.

MARCH 23, 1948
Why do we have this legislation? Why do
we have a Wheat Board? If you will go
into the rural parts of this country, especially
in the province of Saskatchewan, where as they
say, "you will get it raw", you will find a
certain number of our farmers who complain
that the Winnipeg Grain Exchange .robs them.
Now, what is the Winnipeg Grain Exchange?
It is a voluntary association of men and women
engaged in the grain trade. What does it do?
If a miller in Glasgow receives a request from
a baker for a thousand barrels of flour to be
delivered at the rate of so many barrels a
month for the next twelve months, he cables
to Winnipeg, or wherever he gets his grain, and
asks the price of Manitoba No. 1 delivered
today. Ie is told that it is, say, 80 cents a
bushel. If he wants a certain amount every
month, he is told that he cannot be given
any guarantee as to future prices, but that all
the wheat he wants can be sold to him now
and held for his order. To this the miller
replies that he has not enough money to buy
that much grain all at once. Then what happens? The baker is quoted a price for the
flour delivered throughout the next twelve
months. The agencies in Winnipeg, Chicago,
Kansas City or wherever they are-in the old
days there was one in Budapest-have already
been cabled, and they reply that they will
deliver the wheat in certain months of the year
at a certain price, and all the miller has to
do is pay so much a bushel during that period.
Where did all this start? During the day a
man running an elevator at, say, Alexander,
Manitoba, buys and pays for 5,000 bushels of
No. 1 Northern and 10,000 bushels of No. 2
Northern. He has had his orders from Winnipeg to pay 90 cents a bushel, out of which
he deducts the freight rate to Fort William
and the clearing charges and so on. The rest
of the money goes to the farmer. At night
when the elevator man has finished his work,
he telegraphs the head office at Winnipeg
stating that he has bought 5,000 bushels of No.
1 Northern and 10,000 bushels of No. 2
Northern.
Let us suppose the elevator
belongs to my honourable friend from
Thunder BEy (Hon. Mr. Paterson). The head
office in Winnipeg checks over all the wires
received from different elevators all over the
country and finds that the day before so many
bushels of No. 1 Northern and so many
bushels of No, 2 Northern have been purchased, and the next morning men go into the
pit and offer No. 1 at so much and No. 2 at a
slightly lower figure.
The Grain Exchange, in order to offset these
purchases from the farmers sold the wheat to
the miller in Glasgow-or in Liverpool or
Hong Kong, or wherever he might be. The

293

result was that the buyer of grain in the little
town of Alexander did not have to take off
20 cents a bushel to guarantee himself against
loss. He only had to take off the carrying
charges, which were probably 10 cents a bushel,
and the farmer got at least 9 or 10 cents a
bushel more for his grain. Under present conditions he would probably receive 25 cents a
bushel more. But the farmer would not get
this amount if he did not have the Grain
Exchange to carry on his business. Everything in the world is carried on through an
exchange where buyer and seller can meet.
There is always a certain amount of speculation, and there are wise guys who claim to
know what the price of wheat is going to be
next October. I have tried it myself, but I am
a poor guesser.
Hon. Mr. MORAUD: You were not a wise
guy?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I was not a wise guy;
I was always wrong. I was told that there
was no rain in Australia or on the Russian
steppes, that there was a blight in the United
States and that grasshoppers were eating up
the crop in Alberta. I thought to myself that
white wheat would go up in value, but by the
first of October wheat was coming in from
all over the world: the only grasshoppers to
be found were in the Atlantic Ocean and the
only drought was in the South Pacifie, and
neither had any effect on grain. It is just
one man's guess against another.
The most economical way to handle grain is
through an exchange. In 1929 about half the
grain produced in the West was delivered to
the volunteer pools of the three prairie provinces, the other half being held by the grain
dealers. I am not disclosing inside information, because I am not interested in any grain
company in the world; I am not acting solicitor for any; nor have I ever held any stock in
one. But I do know that in 1929 all the grain
people, including the pools, predicted that
the price of wheat was going to go up, and
consequently they all held their grain. The
outcome was that the Manitoba pool lost over
$3 million, the Saskatchewan pool $10 million
and the Alberta pool approximately $7 million, and they had to appeal to the provincial
governments of Manitoba, Saskatchewan and
Alberta for help.
Hon. Mr. JOHNSTON:
millions aIl told.

t was about $23

Hon. Mr. HAIG: You make -it a little more
than I do, but my figures are about right. That
money was lost because the pool managers
thought they could guess the grain price better
than anybody else could. They could have

SENATE

protected, themselves against loss by selling the
grain, but they wanted to speculate in it. In
the period from 1930 to 1935 the price of wheat
fell to 35 cents a bushel, and the farmers in
Western Canada who believed in the pool
system attributed the fall to the Grain Exchange. Honourable senators, I ask those who
offer that argument whether the price of wheat
did not go down to the same extent everywhere else in the world. That was the world
price at that time, and it is now $3.20 a bushel.
The wheat pools not so long ago urged the
Minister of Agriculture to sell our grain to
Great Britain at $1.55 a bushel. Who was
right and who was wrong? The farmers of
Western Canada have already lost over $300
million because they guessed wrong. The only
proper system in the grain business is to let
the farmer choose whether he will sell his grain
to the Grain Board or to other grain dealers.
Surely that is free enterprise.
Hon. Mr. EULER: You are in favour of
freedom of choice, are you?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Yes.
Hon. Mr. JOHNSTON: They tried to handle
wheat that way, and my honourable friend
(Hon. Mr. Haig) knows what happened.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I told you what happened.
In 1929 the wheat pool would not sell at the
world price. They thought they could get a
better price, but they got it in the neck, "where
the chicken got the axe." That is bound to
happen; it cannot be otherwise. Why should I
have to turn my grain over to the government
and allow them to sell it at $1.55 a bushel when
I can get $3.00 a bushel on the American
market? There is positively no answer to that
argument. The only attempt that has ever
been made to answer it is the statement that
from 1930 to 1935 the price of grain was low.
So much for wheat.
I have been unable to find out what proportion of Canada's total production of oats and
barley, which are local products, has been sold.
I do not think it exceeds 10 per cent, because
most of the coarse grain is consumed on the
farm where it is produced. Oats and barley are
not world commodities but are Canadian commodities, and their use is determined by the
sale of the products for which they are used.
For instance, we raise oats and barley to feed
cattle, hogs and poultry.
Hon. Mr. HARDY: And Scotsmen.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Control of these things will
be taken away from the individual producer.
The main grain crop in western Canada is
wheat. Why the government wants to get
into the oats and barley business, I cannot

understand. Nor can I understand, the drive
for it. It comes largely from one crowd in
Saskatchewan-the crowd that believes in
planned economy. They have beguiled the
Liberals in that province and whatever Conservatives were there into believing that to
have the government in the oats and barley
business will be a goodi thing for the province.
I want to say to the Minister of Agriculture
and to Mr. Diefenbaker and Mr. Tucker that
if they think the inclusion of oats and barley
in this measure will help their election chances
in Saskatchewan, they do not know anything
about the C.C.F. I have been fighting the
C.C.F. for thirty-odd years, and I know they
will say to the people, "Our policy drove Mr.
Gardiner and others to take certain action,
and if you want more C.C.F. policy, more
planned economy, vote for us and we will
see that you get it".
I am opposed to this legislation. As I said
before, I believe that the farmer should have
the choice of selling his wheat te the board
or to independent dealers. In every other
business we are advocating freedom of choice.
Hon. Mr. EULER: But not getting it.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: The honourable gentleman was for a long time a leading member
of the present government, part of the brains
of the government,Hon. Mr. EULER: Spare my blushes.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: -and I never heard of
his doing anything to change the grain
situation.
I will not be extravagant in my criticism of
the bill. I am willing to vote for section 1,
which provides a pension fund, although I
think this is improper, as in my view the fund
should be providýed, by all the people of
Canada. Secondly, I am willing te vote for
increased- payments to producers. Do honourable senators know what started the move te
At the end of
have increased payments?
July last year the crop in my province looked
as if it would, average probably twenty-five
bushels an acre; in fact, in many places the
prospect was for an average of thirty bushels.
But in the first week of August we had, four
or five hot days, and production dropped,
first, to eighteen bushels an acre, and finally
to ten. Then the farmers started to advocate the
payment of $1.50 or $1.60 instead of $1.35 a
bushel. However, it is their money, and I
am agreeable to the increased payment. Then,
as to middlings, I am willing to vote for this
proposed amendment, although I would' prefer
te leave the Act as it is.
But I cannot understand why anybody from
the Prairie Provinces should vote te give the

MARCH 23, 1948
Wheat Board control over oats and barley. If
this part of the bill is passed, the prices for
oats and barley wilI be based on political
considerations, because the largest purchasers
are in provinces other than Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta, which produce the bulk
of these products. Chicken raisers in British
Columbia will advocate a reduction in the
prices of these grains for their benefit, and
livestock producers in Quebec, Ontario and the
Maritime Provinces will make a similar request.
As the people who want lower prices will be
represented in the other house by 190 voices,
wehereas the three Prairie Provinces have only
-55 voices, it is easy to see which side will win
out. Therefore I say that the price of oats
and barley produced in the Prairie Provinces
will be determined, not by world conditions but
by politics. That is bound to be the result.
We have seen that the provinces which made
agreements with the Dominion Government
started one by one to ask for more money.
Well, a demand by six provinces for lower
grain prices, opposed by three provinces who
want higher prices, will cause more disunion
in Canada than any question of subsidies.
When the people who produce the grain are
being pinched by a price fixed to please purchasers in other parts of Canada, there will
be trouble galore.
I think we should send this bill to a committee-the Banking and Commerce Committee
would perhaps be the best one, although I am
not particular about that-and that we should
strike out section 5, which deals with oats and
barley.
The honourable
member
from
Churchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar) suggested that
I wished to have the measure rushed through.
That is not correct, but I am now, as I always
have been, willing to facilitate the business of
this house. I do not think that public opinion
about the Senate will be influenced in the least,
whether we spend a day or a week or a month
on this measure. All that the public will want
to know is what we did about it. I can see
considerable room for argument about a pension fund, and about increased payments to

producers, and middlings, but I can see little if
any possibility of argument about oats and
barley. For these reasons, I am willing to have
the bill referred to committee.
May I now say one word apropos of the
suggestion by the leader of the government?
I think we should adjourn tomorrow or Thursday for three weeks, so that we who come from
distant parts of Canada may have a chance,
after an absence of three months, to look over
the local situation and see if our homes are
still there.

Hon. T. A. CRERAR: Honourable senators,
I must ask your indulgence while 'I address you
this afternoon. I have had an attack of
laryngitis and it is very difficult for me to
speak, yet I do not want to sit in silence
when the motion for second reading of this
bill is under consideration. The honourable
leader opposite touched upon past conditions
that have led us to the point where we are
today, and if you will be patient I shall t·ry to
state briefly the genesis of this whole business.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. CRERAR: The so-called pooling
system of grain swept across the Prairie Provinces in the years 1923 and 1924, and as a
result three provincial pools were established:
in Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba.

The

principle upon which the pooling plan for grain
operated was based on an irrevocable five-year
contract which the individual farmer signed
with his pooling organization, that throughout

the period of the contract he would deliver all
his grain to the pool. In addition, the contract
specified that the pool management could
deduct two cents per bushel each year from
the proceeds of his wheat and in addition one
per cent of its value. The two cents per bushel
was considered an elevator reserve, and was
subsequently used for the purpose of building
or buying elevators at the various country
points at which the pool operated. The one
per cent was to form a comirrcial reserve.
The plan upon which the pool operated, so
far as returns to the producer were concerned, was this. The pool made an advance
when the farmer delivered his wheat to the
pool, and at the end of the year when the
total proceeds had been secured from the grain
marketed that year, a payment was made by
way of what was called participation certificates. That is, the accumulated balance was
distributed pro rata among all farmers who
had supplied grain to the pool. Obviously the

pool, if it was to operate successfully, had to
keep its initial advance well within safe
bounds; otherwise, it would run into difficulties. That is precisely what happened in 1929.
The honourable leader opposite (Hon. Mr.
Haig) rather gave the impression to the house
that the pool suffered the heavy losses that
later ensued because it had speculated in grain.
That is not correct. In 1929, when grain prices
were at a high figure, the pools fixed their
initial advance, as I recall now, at $1.25 a
bushel. At that figure they thought they were
well within the margin of safety, and the banks
financing them evidently thought so too. But
in the autumn of 1929 a general collapse took
place. Not only did grain prices go down, but

SENATE

stock prices and values of all other commodities went down to an equal extent. Some considerable time before the end of the grain
season that year, which was July 31, the pools
found the market had gone down substantially
below the advance of $1.25 per bushel that
they had made to the farmer. That meant
that the pools were in dire financial trouble,
because the great bulk of the grain had moved
out in the early part of the crop year, as it
always does. The banks said, "You now owe
us many millions of dollars, and we will
advance no more money." What were they
to do?
The pools then appealed to the provincial
governments to severally guarantee the banks
in order to save the accounts of the pools.
The amount involved was considerable. My
honourable friend from Central Saskatchewan
(Hon. Mr. Johnston) said it was $23 million.
but I was under the impression it was somewhat more than that. Assuming that the loss
involved when that season's business was
cleared up was $23 million, the provinces had
to stand good for that amount because the
banks had their guarantees given early in the
year, which guarantees had enabled the pools
to carry on.
What happened next? Naturally, the provinces had to take security on the tangible
assets of the pools, which consisted mainly of
elevators throughout the country and, I
believe, of one or two terminal elevators also.
I corne now to the most interesting part of the
story, which the honourable leader opposite
did not touch upon.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: But which he knew.
Hon. Mr. CRERAR: That may be so, but
my honourable friend did not touch upon it.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I did not want to tell it.
It is too sad.
Hon. Mr. CRERAR: The pools then faced
the crop of 1930, and started marketing in
August of that year without funds. All their
tangible securities were pledged to the provincial governments against the guarantees
which the provinces had made.
Before leaving this part of the story I
should say that my honourable friend, the
leader opposite, did not mention that the
province of Manitoba, whose premier was then
the present leader of the opposition in the
federal house-and I think my honourable
friend was a member of the legislatureHon. Mr. HAIG: No doubt about that.
Hon. Mr. CRERAR: -wrote off $1,250,000
of the debt of the Manitoba pool. The obligation was to that extent assumed by the taxoayers of that province.

We go on again with the year 1930, when the
pools had no credit and no bank account.
As I said a moment ago, their tangible assets
were "in hock" to the provincial governments. What were the pools to do? Their
representatives came to Ottawa and interviewed the Prime Minister of Canada, at
that time, Mr. R. B. Bennett, later Viscount
Bennett, and he pledged the credit of Canada
to the wheat pool organization, through its
marketing agency, to supply it with the necessary funds, and this continued until the
original Wheat Board Act was passed by
parliament.
In 1935 when Mr. Bennett was facing an
election, and prospects did not look goodHon. Mr. DUFFUS: Apparently.
Hon. Mr. CRERAR: -he introduced as
a part of his new deal program the wheat
board legislation, which is still on our statute
books. No one will ever convince me that
the origin of the wheat board legislation was
not wholly political in its nature. The late
Mr. McFarland was ap.pointed first chairman
of the board, and the record of the organization is to be found in the reports of committee hearings and discussions in the other house
over the years.
I wish particularly to draw attention to the
fact that the orignal intention back of the
Wheat Board was not to make it a mandatory
board. As the legislation specified, it was the
agent of the producers in the marketing of
their grain, and it was only those producers
who wished to avail themselves of the mechanism of the board that made use of it. There
were no compulsory features so far as the
marketing of wheat was concerned.
That arrangement continued for several years
unti.l the negotiation of the wheat agreement
with Great Britain which, on any fair estimate,
has cost the farmers of western Canada at least
$300 million. It may have been desirable to
supply Britain with wheat at a price of $1.55
a bushel. Few will quarrel with that decision
under the circumstances. But I submit that if
Britain was to receive wheat at less than the
world price, the taxpayers of Canada and not
the wheat producers should carry the responsibility.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. CRERAR: There is nothing new
in my position in that regard.
Hon. Mr. JOHNSTON: There were no
resignations from the government when the
measure was put through.
Hon. Mr. CRERAR: Does my friend refer
to the wheat agreement?

MARCH 23, 1948
Hon. Mr. JOHINSTON: Yes.
Hon. Mr. CRERAR: Well, my honourable
friend will find that I was not a member of the
government when the agreement was made.
It was after the wheat agreement was made
that the compulsory features were introduced,
providing that every farmer must market lis
wheat through the board in order to carry out
the commitments under the agreement. Of
course that bas continued so far through the
course of the agreement; now comes the bill
which is before us.
When the Wheat Board was first set up provision was made for liberal salaries to members
of the board. With that I have no quarrel.
The purpose was to get competent men. Under
the law today the Wheat Board has the power
to employ a staff and to pay the wages and
salaries of that staff. If the board is to be a
permanent institution-and it appears to be
headed that way-probably sone pension
scheme is essential.
But to whom is the Wheat Board responsible?
In legislation which was passed a year or so
ago it was described as an agent of the Crown.
But does the Crown, in the person of the
government, exercise any control over the
number of persons employed by the board or
over the salaries paid to them? I do not think
it does. Certainly the farmers who market
their grain through the board-I am one of
those who, against my own will, have to do it
-have no voice as to the number of employees
the Wheat Board shall have or as to the range
of salaries the board shall pay. So you have
an organization which in that respect is autonomous, and yet it is proposed to establish a
pension plan which will be a charge upon the
farmers' grain. Tha;t is clearly indicated in the
legislation. However, perhaps that is not such
a serious matter. I am more concerned with
the principle. An incorporated company which
desires to introduce a pension plan must first
have it passed upon by its shareholders, because they are the people who are financially
interested. I admit that this procedure was not
followed in the case of the pension plan of the
National Railways; but all they did was to
carry on a plan which was in operation on some
of its constituent railroads when the system
was first brought into being.
We corne now to the next feature, which is
the payment out of the surplus funds now in
the hands of the Wheat Board. To that there
can be no objection. The money belongs to
the farmers, and if the government in its
wisdom, upon the adivice of the board or
otherwise, should decide that this surplus
should be paid out, and that the base price
of $1.35 which the farmer has received on bis
production of 1945, 1946, and 1947 should be

297

increased, aind funds are available, there can
be no -objection. This involves no charge
upon the treasury. It may be of some interest
to speculate how far the governrment may go
in increasing the price, because I gather that
it is the intention to maintain the new price
over the two remaining years of the contract.
It has been said, as I mentioned a little
time ago, that it is important that these payments be made as quickly as possible. That
is one of the reasons why this legislation
is represented, as urgent. Welil, if we pass this
legislation and it gets Royal Assent tomorrow
night, it would not increase in the leastno, not by the time it takes to snap the fingers
-the speec at which payments will be made;
because I surmise that the government already
knows the amount which is going to be paid.
Certainly the Wheat Board knows it, and has
no d-oubt that the legislation will pass, and I
expect that the board is now in process of
preparing the return to the individual farmer
-an enormous job, as I indicated earlier,
because there are several hundred, thousand
accounts to be audited, and approved.
Hon. Mr. JOHNSTON: I think it is stated
in the press that these cheques are all ready
to be mailed.
Hon. Mr. CRERAR: Well, even if that
be true, I do not admit that we in this bouse
should violate good procedure in order that
the cheques may get out ten days or two
weeks earlier than otherwise.
Hon. Mr. JOHNSTON: I agree.
Hon. Mr. CRERAR: I have little comment
to make on the section of the bill which
brings wheat products under closer control of
the Wheat Board. Personally I do not think
it is necessary. In my view it will do neither
much good nor much harm. If any criticism
of the section can be made, it is simply that
the bonds around the individual citizen are
being drawn a little bit tighter.
I pass from that to the- consideration of
what is the most serious objection to this
bill, namely, the decision to include oats and
barley in the system of compulsory marketing
through the Wheat Board. What does that
mean? I do not like compulsion. I have
not the slightest objection to a wheat board.
I wish success to any farmer who wants to
use the mechanism of the board for marketing
his grain. But the fact that six farmers want
to use the Wheat Board mechanism is no
good reason at all why four other farmers who
do not want to use it should be compelled
to do so. That is why I objected to this
principle of compulsion through the Wheat
Board when this subject was before the Senate

SENATE

on a previous occasion. And it is to be
observed that the arguments for compulsion
in respect of oats and barley are net the
same as those which relate to wheat.
It can be argued that there was a case for
the action taken with respect to wheat marketing. We had the British agreement, and in
order to carry it through it was thought
necessary to bring about and carry on this
degree of compulsion. But, as the honourable
leader of the opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig)
has pointed out, oats and barley are largely
matters of domestic concern. I would hazard
the estimate that we export 70 to 75 per cent
of our wheat, and that we consume within
Canada 85 to 90 per cent of our oats and
barley. In other words, these latter grains do
net enter very largely into foreign trade.
Then why bring them conpulsorily under the
board?
Why not remove the restrictions
against, for instance, the export of oats and
barley to the United States and let the producers of these grains get the fullest value
they can for their products? But no, this
legislation proposes te put thema under the
control of this board, and compulsorily so.
Once legislation is enacted in this form every
grower of oats and barley will have to market
his produce under, and only under, the conditions laid down by the board.
That is my basic objection to this legislation, which I say is a ferma of tyranny that we
in a free country should not have to put up
with. Furthermore, this legislation will react
against those who are sponsoring it. Here is
a situation where the Wheat Board will be
trying to hold the balance between the producers of oats and barley in the Prairie Provinces, where these surplus grains are produced,
and the farmers who are feeders in Eastern
Canada.
If this legislation becomes effective in the
handling of oats and barley, is the Wheat
Board to be an agent of the producers, as
specified in the Act when it was first passed,
or is it to be the agent of the people who buy
oats and barley in Ontario, Quebec, the Maritime Provinces and British Columbia? Just as
surely as night follows day, it seems to me,
differences are bound to arise, and they will
finally have to be threshed out around the
cabinet council table of the nation.
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: The Wheat Board
is an agent of the government now.
Hon. Mr. CRERAR: It cannot be otherwise. The Wheat Board says, "We have a
difficulty. What shall we do?" and then yeu
get politics up to the hilt in this business.
May I say to my colleagues from the West
that we should consider very carefully what

this may lead to in the future. Once wheat.
oats and barley become the subject of politics
in Canada-and that is clearly where they are
heading now-and final decisions are made by
political considerations, as must inevitably be
the case, what will be the position of the
Prairie Provinces with fifty-five members in
the House of Commons out of a total of 255,
and with those fifty-five divided up among
Social Crediters, C.C.F'ers, Liberals, Conservatives, and Independents. That situation is

and terminal elevators today control twofifths of the grain storage. They have the
capacity and the brains to organize and
handle their own business, free of the government altogether.
Furthermore, if this legislation is passed
there is a possibility of government subventions. It may interest honourable senators
to know that if they were to scrutinize the
supplementary estimates they would sec the
suim of $31.500,000 set out to make good the
deficits of the Wheat Board which have occurred up to the present time. I do not believe
in any system of marketing grain that puts a
burden on the taxpayers of the country.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. CRERAR: I am absolutely and
positively opposed to it; yet we are getting so
involved in this matter that we are ultimately
going to get to that point. When we do. let
me again remind my honourable friends from
Western Canada, their voice will be a very
minor one in the final decisions which will
be made on these matters when they corne
before parliament, as thcy almost inevitably
will.
Honourable senators, I have spoken at
greater length than I intended, and I certainly
apologize to the house for the inadequacy of
my articulation. I do net think this measure
slould have been brought to parliament in its
present form. The part which has to do with
the payment out of surplus funds is one which
should be unanimously passed by parliament;
but tied up with this is the compulsory features relating to oats and barley. Therefore,
if I vote against the bill because I do not like
the compulsory feature of it, I am also voting
against the distribution of the money which
I think should be paid. I would almost go so
far as to say that this legislation in its present
form is an affront to parliament itself. However, parliaments throughout the world today
are having a rather bad time.

MARCH 23, 1948
I shall fot oppose the second reading of the
bill, but 1 shahl do my utmost in committee
to have the compulsory feature relating to
oats and barley deleted. May I suggest to
my friend the leader of the goverument (Hon.
Mr. Robertson) that the bill be sent to the
Standing Committee on Banking and Commerce, as it is essentially concerned witb a
matter of commerce. Perhaps, too, I might
be a littie freer to criticize the bill there than
I would in the Standing Committee on Natural
Resources, of which I arn the chairman. Notwithstanding the urgency of the payments
I feel so strongly opposed to the compulsory
feature of the bill that if it remains in it when
the bill cornes back to this house I shall vote
against it on third reading.
Hon. NORMAN P. LAMBERT: Honourable senators, I shouId like to refer for a few
moments to some of the factual aspects of this
bill and to some of the background against
which it appears. My honourable friend from
Churchill, 'who has just taken his seat, has
given the bouse a good historical perspective
of this whole subject, and I do flot intend to
retrace bis steps at ail. Because the second
reading of a bill implies support of the principle of the bill as a whole, 1 find great difficulty in approving of second reading. As a
matter of fact, I shahl take the saine attitude
as my honourable friend frorn Churchill. I
shall not oppose the bill on second reading, but
I certainly cannot support the bill as a whole
in its present form. As I indicated when we
discussed the question of procedure, I feel that
every senator is duty bound to look at the
bill from the point of view of the provinces
concerned as well as frorn a federal standpoint.
The Wheat Board was formerly an instrument to serve the needs of the producer, but
by the amendment to the Act Iast year it was
unmistakably established as an agency of the
Crown to the general advantage of Canada.
It will ha remembered. that a very effective
contribution to that debate was made hy the
honourable senator frorn Vancouver South
(Hon. Mr. Farris) when hie discussed the
question of what constitutes the general
advantage of Canada. He convinced me,' and
I think lie left the decided impression on this
bouse, that the provision in the British North
America Act for declaring something to be for
the general advantage of Canada should be
used very sparingly, and only in a case where
by far the larger part of the thing concerned
was for the general advantage of Canada.
I think it can be shown that most of the
implications of section 5, dealing with oats and
barley, are identified with provincial interests
rather than with the general- advantage of

299

Canada, and we should carefully weigh this
measure before passing it on to the provinces
for their implementation.
The question of continuing the Canadian
Wheat Board, which was in existence in 1919
and 1920 and had plenary powers to bandie
ail the wheat and wbeat products of tbis
country, was before parliament in 1922. It
was then decided that legisiation should be
passed to continue the board, subI ect to the
passage of enabling legislation by the western
provinces. When the test came in western
Canada, it was the newly-elected government
of Mr. John Bracken, in Manitoba, that
declined to adopt the legislation, and the
whole proposai fell to the ground. Opposition
to the legisiation was based on the view tbat
it was better to have these products marketed
by the farmers' co-operative organizations
than by the government of the country. I
mention this because I feel very strongly that,
as to the marketing of coarse grains, the same
point of view obtains to a very great extent
at this time. I -have recently been in western
Canada and I know what I am talking about.
I tbink that if section 5 were eliminated we
quite logically migbt adopt the rest of the
bill, in the liglit of the fact that hast year
hoth bouses approved of declaring the Wheat
Board to be an agency of the Crown, or, ini
other words, an instrument to act for the
general advantage of Canada, representing ail
the people. In spite of that, however, I arn
bound to say that there is an inconsistency in
section 1 of the bill, wbich provides for a
pension fund. It was definitely understood
last year, I think, that the existence of the
Wheat Board Act, establishing tbe Wheat
Board as an agency of the Crowni, shouhd be
limited to the terni of the present wheat
agreements covering the so-called contracts
between the Canadian and British goverfiments, and that in 1950, when those agreements came to an end, the Wheat Board Act
wouhd of course bave to be considered again.
We approved of the Wheat Board as an agency
of the Crown for a period flot extending
heyond the year 1950. There is a provision
here to establish a pension fund for a staff
of 6mployees of the Wheat Board, and in
vîew of our action of last year we would be
justifled, I think, in concluding that that pension fund would coincide with the terni of
the Wheat Board Act. There are engaged in
the Wheat Board offices today a considerable
number of men and women, with salaries
ranging aIl the way from $18,000 a year to
8125 or $150 a month. What classification
those pensionswill corne under, and for bow
long, are questions very pertinent to the bill.

SENATE

Another tbing that appeals to me as being
inýconsistent, in the iigbt of the character of
the Wheat Board as an agency of the Crown
representing ail the people of Canada, is that
the cost of maintaining such a pension fund
is to, be borne eutirel by the grain producers
of western Canada. If this institution is for
the general advantage of Canada, representing all the people, surely it. is logical that the
cost of any pension fund for the employees of
the organization should be borne by the people
at large and not, by grain producers alone.
However, that, is a detail iwbich can be discussed in committee, and I think that the bill
as a whole, with section 5 struck out, might
be acceptable to us.
I ceuld raise some points on the proposed
change as to trading in wheat products,' but I
will: not take up more time jîî4. now. There
are a number of questions upon, which we
should be given some definite ligbt in comnmittee, because the bill involves the whole
question of feeding stuifs in relation to the
livcstock industry of tbis country, including
the distribution of feeding stuifs to, the
provinces that are not large producers of
grains3, and there is a possibility of discrimination developing and being harmful to relations between producers and consumers.
I expresse-d my attitude on this bill pretty
emphatically before the motion for second
read'ing. I certainly am opposed to the
mensure as it now stands, especially to, section
5, rclnting to oats and barley.
Hon. W. RUPERT DAVIES: Honourable
senators, 1 doubt if there is anybody in this
honourable house, not exreptinýg the leader of
the government (Hon. Mr. Robertson), who
knows less about wheat and, wheat marketing
than I do. After having listened to the
leader of the opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig), the
senator from Churehill (Hon. Mr. Crerar),'
and the senator from Ottawa (Hon. Mr.
Lambert), 1 am reminded of the bibical
phrase, "Can nny good thing come out of
Nazareth?" I am wondering what is the other
side of this question. Surely the cabinet, which
is sittinýg in counicil here nearly every day,
would not send us a bill that is absolutcly
wrong and opposed to the best intercsts of the
country. I should like to, know what is the
alternative to this bill.. The members wbo
have spoken agninst it have strongly condemcie section 5, whicb would extend the
powers of the Wheat Board to, oats and barley.
I repeat that I know n'othing about the matter, but is it not possible tbat if the Wheat
Board does net control oats and barlcy, our
entire production of these grains would be
shipped across the line?

Hou. Mr. HAIG: That could not be donc,
because there is a prohibition ngainst it.
Hon. Mr. DAVIES: I am nierely asking
for information. What is the alternative to
this bill? Surely someone cmn tell us that.
So far we have heard nothing but cond-emnatien of the measure, and before we are nsked
to vote we should have some information
that will enable us to vote ýintelligently.

PRIVATE BILL
SECOND

READING

Hon. A. W. ROEBUCK moved second
reading of Bill T-6, an Act respecting Canadian Slovak Benefit Society.
H1e saîd: Honourable senators, there is very
littie to be said in connection with this bill.
The explanation, briefly, is that this society
was properly incorporated two years ago.
Under its act of incorporation, and the provisions of the Canadian and British Insurance
Companies Act, the society is required to
obtain a certificate of registry within two
years. I believe that involves the putting up
of a bond within that period of time. For
some reason with which 1 am not familiar that
requirement was not complied with. This bill
extends until next December the time within
which the society can obtain some form of
registration.
When the bill has received second reading
I shaHl ask that it be referred to the Standing

AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS

BILL

FIRST READING

A message was received from the House
of Commons with Bill 171, an act to amend
the Agricultural Products Act.
The bill was read the first time.
SECOND READING

Hon. WISHART McL. ROBERTSON:
Honourable senators, with leave of the Senate,
I now move the second reading of this bill.
The purpose of this bill is to extend for one
year, to March 31, 1949, the life of the
Agricultural Products Act, under which food
contracts with Great Britain are made and
Under authority of the Act
administered.
which is about to expire, contracts were made
for delivery during 1948 of 80 million dozens
of eggs, 50 million pounds of cheese, 195 million
pounds of bacon, and 45 million pounds of
beef. These contracts are the same in all
essential respects as those which have been in
effect since the early part of the war, except
dat the quantities and prices have been
changed to bring them into harmony with
present day conditions of supply.
In general, contract quantities are somewhat
lower in 1948 than they were in 1947, and prices
are somewhat higher. The 1948 price for bacon
is $36.00 per 100 pounds, basis No. 1 sizeable
Wiltshire sides, delivered at Canadian seaboard; with appropriate differentials for other
grades and qualities. The basic price for beef
is $27.50 per 100 pounds of choice quality
carcass beef, delivered at seaboard. Prices for
other grades and qualities range downward to
Two basic prices are provided for
$21.50.
eggs, namely 47- cents per dozen for Grade
A large for spring and summer delivery, and
54: cents per dozen for Grade A large for
winter delivery. Other grades of eggs and egg
products, frozen or dried, are deliverable at
appropriate price differentials. The price of
first quality cheese is 30 cents per pound, f.o.b.
factorv. After assembly and transportation
charges are paid to the seaboard, cheese will
cost the British government approximately 31
cents per pound, f.o.b. steamer Canadian ports.

The British Government has not completed
financial arrangements for the entire year, but
in all cases the contracts are for definite quantities at firm prices, for delivery in the year
1948. It is now estimated that the quantities provided for in the contracts will require
the delivery of all, or practically all, the Canadian surplus after home requirements have
been met. In this connection, it may be
noted that the commodities under contract are
no longer subject to rationing or price control
in Canada; hence the Canadian consumer is
free to buy a full supply. Tentative figures so
far available indicate that pork consumption
in Canada has been somewhat lower in the
first quarter of 1948 than it was in the last
quarter of 1947, but it is still substantially
above the pre-war level. Canadian consumption of other contract commodities, such as
beef, eggs and cheese, appears to be continuing at or near record levels.
It is the intention of the government that
the administration of the contracts shall continue in the hands of the Meat Board, the
Dairy Products Board and the Special Products Board, all of which have been administering similar contracts since 1940-41.
In general, the boards obtain supplies for
delivery to Great Britain by standing ready
ýto accept all products offered in conformity
with their prices and specifications. Products
are accepted from all persons and firms who
meet the specifications and who operate in
conformity with other laws and regulations
governing the processing and handling of the
food products concerned. The suppliers are,
in general, responsible for the safe delivery
and sound condition of the products until
they are actually loaded on the ship. There
are some minor exceptions to this rule, such
as the acceptance of products for storage in
circumstances which make immediate delivery
All purchases
impossible or inadvisable.
made by the boards are financed by a special
vote of money for that purpose. As deliveries
are made, claims are presented to the British
Treasury, and it in turn reimburses the
boards' funds. Receipts from sales to the
British balance payments made to suppliers
by the boards.
One important effect of the operation of
the contracts is the establishment of minimum
prices for the contract commodities. Since the
boards stand ready to buy all products offered
at the contract prices, no producer or supplier
need sell below these levels. This situation
leads to stability of price to both the producer
and consumer. In general, it tends to encourage production and to maintain supply of
essential foods. Prices of other and related

MARCH 24, 1948
commodities not directly under contract also
tend to become stabilized in relation to prices
of the contract commodities.
Another beneficial resuit is that uniformly
high standards of quality'are maintained, thus
enhaucing the standing of the products in the
British market. This will be of great value
to the industries concernied in the event of the
British Government discontinuing bulk buying, and of trade returning to private channels.
The indications are, however, that the British,
while they are -compelled to continue rationing
and price control, will also have to continue
bulk buying of importas. In so far as the
Canadian situation is concerned, the production, proccssing and delivery of the products
to seaboard are entirely in private hands and
subject to competition among the various
companies and individuals concerned. This
condition ensures efficient production and
processing ini Canada, and maintains the various units of the industry in sound operating
condition.
While the 1948 contracta bave not been
3igned by both parties, they are in effeet by
.eason of an exchange of letters which covered
the essential points of price and quantity. It
is expected that the formai documents wili. be
signed at an early date. I believe that since
thîs memorandum, was prepared for me by my
secretary, the Minister of Agriculture stated in
the other house-although lie did not disclose
the reason for bis assurance-that any doubt as
to the purchaser .being able to settle for these
comnmodities ini a mnanner satisfactory to the
Canadian government lias been removed.
Hon. JOHN T. HAIG: I do flot intend to
indulge in a speecli at this late stage. Ahl I
wisli to say is that the feature of the bill wliicb
I like best is that its effeet is limited to one
year, and that 'thereafter we can consider the
matter again.
Bon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Honourable senstors, it is possible that *adjournment for the

meantime, and, when we bave concluded our
immediate business I shahl move that the

CANADIAN WHEAT BOARD BILL
REPORT 0F COMMITTEE

Hon. Mr. BEAUREGARD presented and
moved concurrence in the report of the Standing Committee on Banking and Commerce on
Bill 135, an Act to amend the Canadian Wheat
Board Act, 1935, as follows:
The Standing Committee on Banking and Commerce to whomn was referred the Bill (135. from
the Bouse of Communs), in tituled: "An Act tu
amend The Canadian Wheat Board Act, 193e",
have in obedjence to the order cf reference of
March 23, 1948, examîned the said Bill and now
heg leave to report the same with the following
amendment:
1. Page 3.

Delete clause 5.

Be said: For the information of honourable
senators who were not present this morning at
the meeting of the committee, I shouhd say
that clause 5, the dehetion of which is recommended in the report, was intended to empower the Governor in Council to regulate
and extend the application of Parts III and IV
of the bill to oats or to barley, or to both oats
and barhey. If the -recommendation is concurred in, I und-erstand that matters will remain
as they are today, and. the board will have no
authority in respect of coarse grains.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: When shaîl the
amendinent he taken into consideration?
Hon. Mr. BEAUREGARD: With heave of
the Senate, now.
Hon. WISHART MeL. ROBERTSON:
Honourable senators, I suggest to this bouse
that the recommendation of the Standing
Committee on Banking and Commerce, that
Section 5 of Bill 135 be deleted, be flot concurred in for severai reasons. The first is that
the government considers that Section 5
embodies the most important principle of the
bill, and is anxious that it should pass parliament. In my position as leader of the
government ini this house I advise honourable
senators that if they do flot see fit to favourably consider my suggestion to retain section
5, and the bill is sent back to the other bouse
without it, the government will recommend
that the action of the Senate be not concurred in. What will happen to the bil after
that is, of course, uncertain. This is not the

SENATE

first time that such a thing has happened and
it will probably not be the last.
Honourable senators, I do not know that I
can add much to the excellent speeches made
n this bill yesterday. I am afraid the arguments made against it were of much greater
ength and more clearly expressed than my
Jefence of it; but I should remind honourable senators that this is permisive legislation, te enable the federal government, under
certain corditions. te bring the interprovincial
sale of oats and barley under the Wheat Board,
se that the amount of wheat te be sold and the
price of it may be controlled. As the minister
in charge of this bill has explained, the government is asking parliament for this authority
because, for well known constitutional and
policy reasens, it is considered desirable that
complementary legislation should be passed
by the three western provinces which, in the
main, are the areas which have a surplus
of oats and barley for interprovincial expert.
I am advised that it is the view of the government that if only two of the three provinces pass complementary legislation it would
be impossible te put this measure into effect.
However, the present action of the government is the result of urgent representations by
the Canadian Federation of Agriculture,
which believes that this legislation will be te
the advantage of producers and consumers
alike.
I am advised that even should power be
given by parliament to the government, and
complementary legislation be passed by the
three prairie provinces-I mention them
because there has been some discussion as te
whether or not it would be necessary to have
legislation by the other provinces, which are
largely consumers-the government would
secure information fron the best possible
sources and on that would endeavour te form
an opinion as te the views of the majority
of the agricultural interests in the whole country, both producers and consumers.
Various arguments have of course been
presented against the bill, because on a question of this kind there are bound! te be conflicting views. My honourable friend from
Churchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar), who is always
alive te the interests of agriculture in general
and particularly to those of western Canada,
suggests that the political strength of the eastern provinces would influence the Wheat
Board and the government-to whatever
degree the government has te do with these
matters-in a way that would be detrimental
te agriculturists in western Canada. He was
quite confident that if section 5 were not
struck out of the bill the consumers of eastern
Canada would be able te buy their coarse

grains at prices which would be unsatisfactory
te the prodtcers in the prairie provinces.
My honourable friend has had se much more
experience than I in these matters that I hesitate to disagree with him, and perhaps any
clisagreement expressedi by me would be futile,
but I must say that I did not regard his argument as being very strong. I know of course
that what is call'ed eastern Canada has more
represcntatives in another place than western
Canada has, and in these circumstances it is
possible that legislationi might be passed
which, if acted upon. by the government, would
result in prices that western producers would
not like te accept for their coarse grains. But
after all, hoiourable senators, there is no law
to compel anyone in the West te prodîuce and
seill grains at an unprofitable price. And by
the reverse token, should the West exert political pressure entirely out of proportion te
its population, as I remember it has frequently
done in the past, and should it succeed in
obtaining a price that consumers in castern
Canada regarded as prohibitive, the Wcest
would, thereby diefeat its own interests.
Se I think there is not much in that argument of my honourable friend. Indeed, the
minister specifically dealt with that point, and
said, that even after the provinces had passed
complementary legislation, one of the important considerations would be the degree of
unanimity that had been achieved hotween
western and eastern agricultural interests on
this important question. Perhaps thoSe wxho
are close te the farming interests feel that it
would be impossible te get agreement on this
matter among any consid-erable number of
them. On that point I am not competent to
speak, except te say that were a reasonable
degree of agreement net reached, that fact
in itself would probably cause the government
te refrain from going ahead under the
legislation.
But, honourable senators, I think there is
something deeper than has yet been discussed
here in connection with the urge te do something along the line proposed in this bill.
Regardless of what action this house may see
fit te take, I believe from the bottor of my
heart that something along that line will be
done sooner or later. It strikes me that one
of the outstanding developments in the recent
history of Canada-indeed, sometimes I can
hardly understand this development-has been
the willingness of the agricultural interests to
accept for their products a lower price than
could be got in export markets; and I believe
that the compelling motive behind this bas
been a search for stability. As the leader
opposite pointed out, the West bas goue

MARCU 24, 1948
through the painful experience of selling its
wheat at a high of $3.50 and a low of 35 cents,
and I think there is a hopeful search for more
stable conditions, under which neither of these
extreme prices would be possible.
The West had barely recovered from the
troubles and difficulties that arose from the
depression when the Second World War broke
out, and I regard it as a tribute to the comnmon sense of the agricultural interests that
th-ey restrained the natural impulse to demand
for their products the highest prices that could
be secured. I believe that the western producers who support this bill are not desirous
of extraeting the last cent out of eastern consumers, and that equally the eastern consumers
who support the bill are not desirous of obtaining coarse grains from the West at ridicuFrom the unanimity
lously low prices.
expressed by representatives of tbe Canadian
Federation of Agriculture who came before
the governiment, I judge that they believe it
possible to strike a happy medium-a price
that will be reasonably satisfactory to both
sides and bring about a greater degree of
stability.
Practically ail of us are looking for stability.
We have achieved it to a certain extent in the
field of labour relations. Out of contributions
by the employer and employee, we have provided unemployment insurance, so as to
cushion the effect upon an employee who has
to be temporarily laid off. This bill itseif
contemplates providing a certain degree of
security for grain producers. It bas become
part of the function of governments ta provide
means whereby people may feel more secure.
For rny part, while of course I derive a great
deal of pleasure through my work and associations here, I say frankly that I do flot overlook the security that 1 enjoy as a member of
the Senate. And it is security that the agricultural interests of this country are Iooking
for.
I arn not saying that this bill is perfect, that
it couid not be improved. My 'point is that
the agriculturists are looking ta the parliament and people of this country to give them the
consideration to whîch they are entitled for
baving willingly acquiesced in a degree of
price restriction on their products in order
that Canada as a whole might benefit. I submit that we should not dîsregard their views
as ta this measure, which they hope wîll at
least provide a degree of stability to the grain
trade.
Hon. Mr. HORNER: May I ask the leader

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I arn referring ta
the views expressed ta the goverfiment by the
Canadian Federation of Agriculture.
Hon. Mr. HORNER: Do you know what
percentage of farmers in Canada that organization represents?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I ean oniy give
such information as I have. I am unaware of
any such representative group having expressed
different views.
Following the sitting of the committee I
took the precaution of speaking to the Prime
Minister and the members of the government,
and I now inform this house that the government considers this section ta be a major part
of the bill. I ask honourable senators, therefore, to give it as favourabie consideration as
they see fit.
Hon. JOHN T. HAIG: Honourable members, 1 spoke on this question yesterday in
both the house and the committee, and I will
nat discuss it at length now..
The cammittee did flot see fit ta recommend
the part of the bill which wouid put oats and
barley under contrai of the Wheat Board.
The *honaurabie leader of the government has
said that the Counicil of Agriculture supported
that part, but I do not tbink hie emphasized
as much as he ought ta have dans the fact
that the operatians of the board, ta be successfui, require the passage of legisiation by at
least three provinces. My friend admits that
legisiatian must be passed by at least Vhree
provinces; I think it should be passed by fine.
My reason for thinking this is that such
provines~ as Ontario and Quebec are short of
feed this year, and the Department of Agriculture in each of those provinces is pressing
the farmers ta produce more coarse grains. The
Minister of Agriculture in Ontario is advocating -the production in bis province of an
additionai 200 million busheis.
Let us suppose for the moment that Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta do pass concurrent legisiation. The resuit would be that
the Manitoba farmers, for instance, wauid
came under the contrai of the board and
would be obliged ta accept the prie it offsred.
On the other hand, tbe Ontario farmers wouid
nat be sa cantroilsd, and they wouid seli their
grains wherever they wishsd, at the highest
price thsy eou-Id get, and wouid buy cheaper
grain from the board, at its price. Every
buying province wante ta get grain as chsap
as possible.
Let me illustrate my pbint. On August 1 the
price of oats and bariey in' Canada was fixsd
at a certain level. When the price ceiling wss

grains irnmediateiy w-ent uip by approxirnately

friend the leader of the governent niay say,
1 believe that this is a political question.
He praiýýed the farmers of western Canada for
producing and selling whecat at $1.55 a bi'shel,
1
but 1 arn bound to tel my hionourable friend
that those farimers think thev should have got
the price on the world riiirket, as the American
farmers did. There are oniy a few-a noisy
few-who be1iev e that the wheat deal was a
The farmers of western
gond one for us.
Canada have lost approximately $300 million on
the wheat, contracts alone.
The wheat producers are today selling their
grain to millers at $1.55 a bushel to make bread
for the people of Canada. The w'orld price is
at Ieast $3.00 a bushel. I. as a consumer
in the city of Ottawa, arn eating bread mada
from foeur of the wheat whichi sold at $1.55
a bushel when the farmer sheuid have received
$3.00 a bushel for it. The people of Canada
shou'id pay the difference.
May I refer te Premier Gar-son of Manitoba?
He is nlot on the saine side of polities as I arn,
but is one of the able members of the Liberal
party in Canada. Be wrote a letter to Mr.
Howe in which he set out what Manitoba
would like te know hefore it passes complementary legisiation. 1 read the letter in coinmittee this rnorning and will nlot burden the
bouse with it now. Premier Garson said that
the farmers of western Canada, and especially
of his own province, shouid not have to take
a loss on the price of wheat, but that the
people of the rest of Canada shouid make up
the difference, -and he asked if they were wiiling to do that. I have here Mr. Howe's
reply, in which he makes no promise that they
will. He says that without the co-operation of
the province of Manitoba the provisions of
this mensure cannot succeed.
In comrnittee this morning an honourable
senator-I think it was the leader of the
gevernment-stated. that the Bouse cf Ceinmons had passed this measure, and therefore
we should accept it. That is flot a very good
argument. If this legislation were presented
in the Bouse of Commnons in t.he next ycar,
and in the meantirne there had been an
election and the governent was sustained, I
would assume that -the people cf western
C'anada wvere in faveur cf the measure. and
I would bow te the wiii of the people.

Nobody knows today whethcr the people
cf the West want this legislation or not. The
farmier mernbers of the Cominittce on Agriculture in the other place represent only a
very sinall prloportion cf the grain producers.
I knrow the~ inembcrs from Manitoba, and
certainly they do not represent the great body
cf farmners in that province. The people who
best represent, Manitoba on an issue of this
kind are the rnerbers cf the legisiature cf that
province. There can be no doubt about that.
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: Why flot ieave it
to thern, then, and let thin settlc it?
Hon. Mr. HIAIG: I will corne te that. my
friend.
The session cf the Manitoba legisiature is
just about over. Premier Garson's letter is
wurth whiiu, and I recommennd that every
member read it.

Hon. Mr. VIEN: Together with Mr. Bewe's

Hon. Mr. HAIG: Yes. The honourabie
leader bas them both.
As I have said, it is anticipated that the
present session of the Manitoba legislature
wiil end temerrow, and knowing the character
of the cabinet ef that province as I do, I
doubt very much if they w'euld sit for the
next day or twe te take up new legisiation.
Truc, a special session ceuld be calied, but I
doubt that i't wouid be. Consequently, if I
arn right, that bouse cannot pass any 1egisiatien iintil next winter; therefere we, as a
revising bedy, should exercise our right and
say that we wili delay this measure for one
year, which would be in accordance with the
motion I made in committee tbis merning.
Then if the measure came back te us next
year, and the gevernment was able te say that
the legisiatures ef Maniteba, Saskatchewan
and Alberta had passed upen it. my reasons
for oppesing it would be ail shot te pieces,
because the people clesest te the problem
would bave considcred it and deait with it.

MARCH 24, 1948

If I were a member from the province of
Ontario or Quebec, I would want to know what
the legisiature in that province was goin-g to do
about the matter, because it is entirely one of
provincial jurisdiction. It is no doubt a question of jurisdiction.
Hon. Mr. VIEN: Is that point clear?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: It is quite clear. Mr. Howe

and I prcsume he had legal advice frorn the
Crown.

Hon. Mr. HAIG: I will pause juýst a moment

and bazley are property. The section ta which
my friand refera has ta do with how grain
shaîl be plantcd; but once the grain leaves the
ground it bacornes praperty, and is solely
within the jurisdiction of the province.
Hon. Mr. VIEN: I arn -a bit confusad, in the
matter, and I arn seeking light. If I correctly
understand Section 5, that part of the bill deals
only with exports from and importa inta
Canada and the transportation of wheat end
wheat products from ana province ta another.
If that is so, it transcends the boundaries of one
province. and even the boundaries of Canada.
Does it not. therefore, flu directly under

adopt this bill? It cannot be made applicable
in the erop year baginnîng the lst af August.
Hon. Mr. COPP: It can do no harm.

Hon. Mr. HAIG: To rny mind this contraIs
section is unnecessary. 1 have neyer been in
favour ai contrais. My hanourable friend says
that contrais were in oparatian during the
war. I may remind hima that a prominent
official ai the Dominion Government, speaking
yesterday in Toronto, said that contrais wbich
might be enforced during tirne ai war were

very difficuit if nat impossible ai enforcement

That difflculty raflects a tendency ai aur

Except for a faw people whose disposition is

must be remembered that ai the total product

sold; the rest is used domestically within the
province in which it is grawn, and mostly by

the people who produce it. I arn sure that what
will happen if this lagislation is passed, is
precisely what my friand the leader opposite
says will not happen. An honourable senator

Hon. Mr. DUPUIS: Arn I te understand

amendment but is oppesed te the wbole bill?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: No. My enly objection
is te tbe clause relating te oats and barley.
Hon. Mr. DUPUIS: But according te the
honourable senator's argument, if there were
ne control our wheat could be sold at $3 a
bushiel.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: At the preserit time it
would sell foi' about $3 a bushel.
Hon. Mr. DUPUIS: How dees the bonourable gentleman reconcile bis position on this
amendment with the fact that hie is in faveur
of the bill?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I arn net in faveur of the

What country was

Hon. Mr. DUPUIS: Then yeu are against
the bill?

Hon. Mr. HAIG: Canada was sellin.g for
that price te, an-y country which wanted te
buy ixheat; an'd ail countries want to buy it.

Hon. Mr. HAIG: No. I said I was in
fav our of the provisions for pensions, the paying eut of the balance of money due te the
producers, and the contrel of wbeat products.
It is because I fear the extension of the general
!policy of controls that I arn epposed te the
inclusion of oats and barley. The difference
hetween the control of coarse grains and the
control of wheat is that wheat is seld on the
world market, wbereas we selI very little oats
and barley outside our own country, although,
if the government weuld permit us te do se,
we could dispose of a certain ameunt te the
United States.
Foi' the reasons I have mentioned, it is my
firm opinion that this bouse would do well te
pass those sections of the bill wbich bave been
apprnved by thei cnmmitee, and te defer the
adoption of the coarsèe grains section for
another year. If, meanwhile, the legislatures of
Manitoba, Saskatcbewan and Alberta desire
the implementatien of section 5 of this bill,
I shaîl bave notbing more te say.

lon. Mr. SINCLAIR: That is only the
C:înadian price. What is the world price?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: That. is what Mr. Melver
thinks is the world, price, hecausýe hie said we
arrive at the world price by finding what
xxheat is selling for in Chicago, St. Louis, New
York, and any other place where it is sold.
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: What other place
is therc, except in, the United States?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: There is the world, market.
The prýople of Brazil are wil-ling to pay us
$3.30 a bushel for wheat, or a corresponding
price for fleur based on that figure.
Hon'. Mr. SINCLAIR: The people of Atîstralia sold wheat for much more than that,
but their price is net the world price.

1 consider this legisiation to be invidious
as between the consuming and producing parts
of this country, and 1 feel that it is an
irresponsible step on the part of the federal
goverfiment to present to any province the
power to make possible legislation wbich, in
essence, sbould be considered as for the general advantage of Canada. For these tbree
reasons I intend to vote for the report of the
committee.
Hon. T. A. CRERAR: Honourable senators, I dare say you will be getting a bit
weary of listening to my observations about
this bill. I listenýed with interest to the
moderate and eloquent speech made by tbe
leader of the government (Hon. Mr. Robertson) in whicb hie suggested that the report of

the rules, to have a two-day period intervene
between the first and second readings of the
bill. This was done at the request of the
honourable leader on this side, to facilitate
the business of parliament. Consequently the
bill was discussed yesterday and referred to
the Standing Committee on Banking and
Commerce for further consideration. The
committee met last night and again this
morning, and 1 think that the various aspects
of the bill, particularly Section 5, which has
been the contentious part, were thoroughly
discussed from ail viewpoints. A mature and
decisive conclusion, namely, a vote of 15 to S
favouring the elimination of Section 5 was
reached. As a member of the government,

SENATE

ture, we are asked to incorporate the coipulsory feature in connection with the markcting of oats and barley.
With all moderation let me say to this
honourable house that we siould weigh this
problei with the greatest possible consideiatien, because this feature of the bill is of the
essence of socialisiie legislation. Almost the
first plank in the Co-operative Commonwealth
Federation's progran was the setting up of
import and export boards te control the commerce of the country. The C.C.F. were quite
willing to put shackles on the hands of the
individual citizen. because in their superior
virtue they inagined that Ithey could look
after his business mtuch better than he could
look after it hinself. It is worthy of note
that the C.C.F. government in Saskatchewan
-the
first and, I hope and pray, the last
C.C.F. governmuent that wc shall ever have
in this country-proceeded to put under control various aspects of provincial business by
this saine procedure of boards with compulsory powers. Are we to adopt that kind of
legislation? Is a Liberal party, of all others,
te adopt that kind of legislation, which bas in
it the essence of tyranny? ionourable senators, I cannot believe it.
It is also worthy of note that before the
debate on the resolution stage had proceeded
any distance in another place Premier Douglas
of Saskatchoewan was wiring down to the
minister and the government here, asking
"What can we do to help you in getting this
legislation brougît into effect?" That, honourable senators, is not a very high certification
for me. For that additional reason I am
wholly opposed to the retention of section 5.
If we are going into socialist legislation all
down the line, let the people of Canada have
a chance to talk about it. Every time he
C.C.F. have appealed for support, they have,
except in Saskatchewan, lest ground.
The Rigbt Hon. Mr. MACKENZIE: In all
fairne-ss, may I ask the honourable senator a
question? He lias mentioned the possibility
of section 5 being surrounded with elements
of socialism. In what respect does this section
differ from present features of the Wheat
Board Act?
Hon. Mr. CRERAR: In so far as it provides
for compulsion it does not differ from the
part of the act dealing with wheat marketing.
But, as I pointed out, that was passed by
parliament because of the necd to carry out
the British agreement, and will remain in effect
for only a limited period of time.
I come back to my point that every time the
C.C.F. appealed for support of their program

of socialization, of import and export boards,
and of shackling the commerce of the country,
they bave been defeated, except in Saskatchewan. And as I said a few moments ago, I
hope that the present goverement of that
province is the fir-t and the last C.C.F. government that we shall have in this country.
The situation created by section 5 would
emphasize sectional differences and lead to
in tihis county; and, beaven
political unesi
knows, we want to abate that as much as we
possibly can. Why tIo I -a' t hat section 5
wou-Id hau e tiat effect ? If that section stands,
and if the provinces pass complementary legislation, the Wheat Board will have to dettermine
the pritc bettween the selleis Of barley and
oats in the Prairie Provinces and the consumers
of tbche grains in Ontario, Quebec and the
Maritime Provinces. and also in British
Columbia. Now, under the legislacionî as it
stands today the board is an agent of the
government. We cannot get away front tiat.
Tolay the government determines the price
at which the contract grain will be sold, and
just as surely as nigbt follows day the Whcat
Board, with the best intention in the world,
will run into difficulty. Here I wish to pay a
tribute to the board, not because two of its
members are sitting tit in the gaIlery, but
beau-e it ias donce an excellent job, even
under veiy difficult conditions. But we are
putting upon the board iere the job of acting
as arb;ier between whbat the farimers in
Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba shall
get for their oats and barley, and what the
feeders in Quebec, Ontario, the Maritittes and
British Columbia shall pay for those grains.
Can you imagine that those farmers will get
together around a table in a sort of love feast
and decide unanimously on a price? I cannot.
So the board will have the job of trying te be
the arbiter.
But the board cannot be the arbiter, because
this question. wiill become a political one which
will land right on the doorstep of the government. The final decision as to the price that
wiU be paid for oats andi barley in the prairie
provinces will be made in Ottawa around the
cabinet council table. It cannot be otherwise.
Then you will have pressure coming from all
sides, for favours here and faveurs there.
There will be discontent on the prairies because
the price is net adequate, and discontent in
the East because the people there feel they
are paying to mueb. And, having had considerable experience as a cabinet minister, may
I say that the last job on earth I would want
under thoSe circunistances would be that of
sitting around a table helping to decide on

that price.

MARCH 24, 1948

Then th.e matter will go further into political discussion. The farmers of Ontario, will
complain that they are paying too much for
barley and nats, and the politicians in this fair
province will say: "We wholly agree with you.
This in-iquitous government and this iniquitous wheat board are favouring the prod-ucers
of the prairie provinces". The opposite contention will be made by' western politicians.
I put it t& the common sense of this country,
and particularly of this b-onourable bouse: is
that a desirable condition to get into? I cannot sec that il. is.
I think it wo-uld, be disastrous if section 5
were passe, and that is why I feel so st.rongly
and. have spoken se strongly against it. So
far as I arn concerncd, honourable senators, I
amn going to vote for the -adoption of the
repuort.
Hon. THOMAS VIEN: Honourable senators, the more I listen to tbc arguments presented in this eLebate, the more con'fused I
become. 0f course, most of the questions
involved here concern directly the interests of
the western provinces. and, it is flot oftcn that
wc in Quebec h-ave to eteal with these matters.
The honourablýe
senator from Churchill
(Hon. Mr. Crerar) bas advanceed some strong
arguments again.st section 5 of the bill, and
in my opinion the most compelling of these is
tbat the measure does flot secrn to be of sucb
urgcncy that, wc shouldj not take ample time
to ponder over it. No reasoniing that bas been
presentcd so far in. this debate bas convinced
me tbat we sbould, dispose of the bill prier
to the Easter recess. I arn un-able to sec that
ca]aniity, or even any great inconrvenience,
would resuit from our allowing the bill to
stand, ii abeyance un-til we reconvene in, the
latter part of April.
As regards the socialistic ebaracter of the
legistation. I agree with the bonourable sen-ater f.rom Cburcbill. I bate socialism. To my
mnd, it is opposed to the fundamýental principle of the Liberal party.
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: Hear, bear.
Hon. Mr. VIEN: The fundamental principle
of the Liberal party is to liberate the buman
being fromn ail the sbackles that bind bim and
prevent him fromn reaching bis goal, whicb is
the pursuit of happiness.
Any legislation,
therefore, wbich tends to limit or curtail the
liberty of the individual is, in my opinion,
anti-Liberal.
During tbe past few years, due eitber to war
or other emergency conditions, the government
of this country bas placed upon our statute
books a great deal of socialistic legisiation.
But none of it lias been more socialistic tban
the mesure establishing the Wheat Board
itself. If tbe legislation now before tbe bouse
58t53-22

to provide for the inclusion of oats within the
jurisdiction of the Wbeat Board is socialistic,
then the legislation creating the board itself
was socialistie also. Therefore I hate the
Wbeat Board and the legislation under which
it operates just as mucli as I hate this
particular feature of the bill now before us.
Yet the Parliament of Canada in its wisdom
bas passed an act creating tile Whcat Board.
and bas given to it certain powers in the
bandling of wheat.
I ar n fot unmindful of the remarks of the
honourable leader opposite (Hon. Mr. Haig),
that whcat is a world-widc commodity and that
its consumption in Canada. compared to the
quantity for export, is negligiblýe. That differentiates it from coarse grains. But wby are we
not just as froc to trade in wheat as in any
other commcdity?
I bave a great deal of sympathy for the
argument urged by the leader opposite, that
there is no reason why the producer of wheat
in Canada sbould be obliged to accept $1.55 per
busbel for bis product wben the price on the
world market is $3.00 or more. Yet I think I
amn rigbt in saying that it is the consensus of
opinion in Canada tbat the elemnent of stability
bas been of greater value to the producers tban
tbe temporary advantage of higber prices. I
beliève the producers were wise in taking the
attitude they did. If there bad been no control,
and the wbeat bad býeen thrown indiscriminately on the markets of the world, there is no
guarantee that the price would bave remained
at approximately $3.O0. It migbt have fallen
off. At any rate, tbrougb our legislation we
bave introduced an element of stability for a
period of tbree -or four years, and I tbink I
arn right in saying tbat the mai ority of those
interested in growing wbeat are agrecable to a
stabilized price for the time being.
I arn extremnely concerned and amazed at
tbe socialistie character of this legislat ion; but
in passinkg this measure we are doing no more
tban we bave done in a number of other instances, particuarly in the creation of the
Wheat Board.
Another question that 1 bave not been able
to understand. is the necessity for concurrent
provincial legislation. It bas been stated that
this bill would be unworkable witbout confirmatory legislation 'by the provinces of
Manitoba, Saskatcbewan andt Alberta.
Section 3 of tbe bill introduces a new
section 27, which reads:
2,7. Except as permitted under the regulations,
no person other than the Board shall
(a) export f rom or import into Canada wheat
or wheat produets owned by a person other than
the Board;

SENATE

(b) transport or cause te be transported from
one province to another province, wheat or
wheat produets owned by a person other than
the board;
(c) sell or agree to sell wheat or wheat prodcuts situated in one province for delivery in another province or outside of Canada; or

Hon. A. L. BEAUBIEN: Then the opinion
is no good?
Hon. Mr. VIEN: I do not say that. It may
be that my opinion is of no value. But I
would like to be convinced that I am wrong.

(d) buy or agree to buy wheat or wheat
products situated in one province for delivery in
another province or for delivery outside of
Canada.

Hon. A. L. BEAUBIEN: What would convince you?

All that section appears to do is add wheat
is flour-to the products
products-that
already coming under the provisions of the
Act.
We come now to section 5, which is the
contentious part of the bill. By that section
oats and barley are brought under the provisions of the Act already on the statute
books. It does not affect these grains for
trading purposes within the limits of a province, but only in the matter of transportation
from one province to another, trading between
one province and another, and trading between
a province and a country beyond the boundaries of Canada.
By Section 91 (2) of the B.N.A. Act regulations as to trad and commerce are clearly
within the jurisdiction of the federal government. And Section 95 of that Act reads as
follows:
Ii each province the legislature may niake
laws in relation to agriculture iu the province,
and to immigration into the province; and it is
hereby declared that the Parliament of Canada
may from time to time make laws in relation to
agriculture in all or anîy of the provinces; and
to immigration into all or any of the provinces;
any law of the legislature of a province relative
to agriculture or to immigration shall have
effect in and for the province as long and as far
only as it is not repugnant to any act of the
Parliament of Canada.

Hon. A. L. BEAUBIEN:
another lawyer? Or what?

As far as agriculture is concerned, I cannot
see that under section 95 of the British North
America Act any question can arise which
would require concurrent legislation by the
legislatures of any of the provinces. It follows, in my opinion, that we are not required
to wait for such concurrent legislation.
Hon. A. L. BEAUBIEN: Does my honourable friend know that the officers of the Crown
have advised the governmnent-and the minister sponsoring this bill so informed the conmittee-that concurrent legislation will be
necessary before this measure can come into
effect.
Hon. Mr. VIEN: Yes, but if my honourable
friend were a lawyer he would know that
while lawyers in court treat the opinions of
other lawyers with the utmost respect, they
neverthelkss agrce to disagree.

Hou. Mr. DUPUIS: The decision of a court.
The opinion of

Hon. Mr. VIEN: I think that compelling
reasons should be submitted to us, and I
invite the leader of the government to present
to this house corne convincing reason why,
under the British North America Act, concurrent legislation is necessary. I should like te
understand the legal position. I have not
been able to understand it. It may be that
my honourable friend- knows the situation
better than I do, and that my own limitations
prevent me from appreciating his arguments
on this point.
Hon. A. L. BEAUBIEN: I am not giving
my own interpretation. I am pointing out
what lias been said by the minister who is in
charge of the bill.
Hon. Mr. VIEN: I see. But because the
master has said it I do not agree that he is
right-Magister dixit non ergo verumî c.t.
The argument has been made that the Conmîittee on Banking and Commerce having
examined this bill and reported it, it would be
a disparagement of the committee's judgment
to so much as discuss the report, let alone set
it aside. I do not agree that any such construction can be properly put upon a consideration of the report by this bouse. We refer a
bill to a committee for examination and report,
and when the report comes to this house we
are not deprived of the right to consider it,
or to concur or refuse to concur in any finding
the committee bas made. To fully consider
the report of this or any other committee is
strictly in accord with the best parliamentary
practice. If the whole membership of the
Senate comes to the conclusion that a conmittee bas not properly considered some
aspects of questions which have been referred
te it, it is net only the right and privilege of
the Senate, but its undoubted duty, to refuse
to concur in the committee's findings.
So far as I am concerned, the information
before us is incomplete. I fully appreciate the
fact that the bill has come to us after a very
lengthy discussion in the other place, and that
following this full measure of deliberation our
concurrence is requested. We have given the

MARCH 24, 1948
bill second reading and have referred it to
committee. Although opinions were divided,
the committee recommended that parts of the
bill should be passed and another part struck
out. I am not ready to say that the committee
is wrong. I am not in a position to say that
the committee is right. I agree with the suggestion that this bill should stand over to be
considered by us after recess, that we should
have ample opportunity to consider it in all
its phases, and that we should give interested
parties in Canada the opportunity of presenting their views before we make a final decision.
Hon. J. E. SINCLAIR: Honourable senators, I do not wish at this time to enter into
any lengthy discussion, but I think it is only
fair and right that I should present the viewpoint of those of us who, for a number of
years, have been receiving coarse grains and
mill feeds from the western provinces. These
supplies have enabled us to engage in the
greater production which since the beginning
of the recent war, and for reasons which are
well known, has been recommended and
encouraged. We are now discussing the recommendation of the Banking and Commerce
Committee for the deletion of clause 5 of the
bill. This is a clause which, after the three
prairie provinces by concurring legislation
have given consent, would empower the
Governor in Council to put oats and barley
under the control of the Wheat Board if at
any time the board deemed it necessary.
Let us consider for a minute the import of
this section which was stricken out by the
committee. The federal government is taking
action to open a door, but the door will be
opened only with the consent of the producers
of coarse grains in the three prairie provinces.
If those producers do no-t give consent, the
matter goes no farther. This fact was clearly
stated by the minister to the committee. I
am interested to hear from the honourable
leader of the opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig) and
others that the province of Manitoba will
not consent to the operation of clause 5.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I do not think it will.
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: Well, if the province
will not consent, nothing will be done. It is
for the legislature of Manitoba to decide
whether or not consent will be given. It is
not for senators from the province of Manitoba
to do so. As I have said, if the province
withholds consent, there the matter ends. On
the other hand, if the legislatures of the
prairie provinces believe that, in the interest
of the producers of coarse grains in the West,
they should pass concurrent legislation empowering the federal government to carry out
5853-22j

the provisions of this section and place the control of -these grains under the Wheat Board to
make the section workable, if that be possible,
it will then be up to the federal government
to take whatever action in the circumstances
it deems wise.
The minister referred to the requests made
by the Canadian Federation of Agriculture,
and made it plain to the committee that anyone in the agricultural industry who wished to
make representations to the governments of
the prairie provinces had the right to do so,
and that it would be up to the respective provincial legislatures to determine in the circumstances what action should be taken. If they
pass concurrent legislation, then it is up to
our government to vest the matter in the
Wheat Board.
I wish to say a word about the position of
the farmers in eastern Canada. During the
war they were urged, at the agricultural conferences held in Ottawa in December of each
year, to increase their production of foodstuffs:
bacon, cheese, eggs, poultry, dairy products
and beef.
They responded wonderfully,
increasing their production many times over;
and they were only able to do so because they
could secure the necessary mill feeds and
coarse grain products. The freight assistance
policy of the government helped in this by
enabling eastern farmers to get these products
from their place of origin at a reasonable cost.
This practice definitely encouraged dairy production in the East. While the production of
hogs and bacon may have decreased in some
parts of Canada, the Maritime Provinces have
maintained their production, their output
being greater this year than last. If the
consent of the prairie provinces has to be
obtained in connection with this bill, I shall
not be afraid of what the Wheat Board may
do. On behalf of eastern feeders and farmers,
particularly those of the Maritime Provinces,
I want to say that we do not expect the Wheat
Board or any other body to put a price on
coarse grains that will not be profitable to
western producers. However, we do seek to
establish a price stability and a continuity of
supply that will enable us to produce-at least
until our contracts with Great Britain are
fulfilled-as large a quantity of foodstuffs as
we have produced in the past few years.
I have confidence in the Wheat Board, and I
commend the other speakers who have expressed their confidence in it. I do not fear the
bogy that has been held out by the leader of the
opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig) and the senator
from Churchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar) that it will
become a political affair. What more can be
said of it than that it is good politics? Any-

SENATE

thing that is accomplished in this country
today is a politicai affair. 1 arn aimost forced
to say that some of those who have been
addressing us would like to see a restoration of
the conditions that prevailed in the days
bcfore the Wheat Board came into existence,
when the farmers were free te speculate
through the Exchange, and to, buy and seli
coarse grains as they wisbed.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: I do nlot know
whether i. wouid be quite fair to accuse them
of that, but that thoughit enters one's mind
when iistening to them. I refer particulariy
to the honourabie senator from Winnipeg
(lon. Mr. Hlaig) in whose province the Grain
Exchange is situated.
Ilonourable senators, 1 repeat that if xve in
the Maritime Provinces wishi to maintain our
prcent Piroduction of foodstiiffs. we must have
an opportunity to biiy the coarse grains and
iii fepcls thaut we do net produce otîrseives.
W'e liai ne flour iill to spcak of, and must
get ail our coarso grains from the largor milis
of Ontario and the West.
Hon. Mr. HORNER: May I ask whether
the greater part of your fecd is net wheat?
lon. Mr. SINCLAIR: No. We get lowgi ode wheat for our pouitry, but ie do not
gct any for mnilling. If I mnay digrcss for a
momient . I wouid say that bc cause of tlhe
fiight differentiai that is given to the bigger
iiis. wlihieh onabios them to ship their products for expert at a iow freighit rate, it is
imiposý;ibiî to set up a successfui fleur miii in
the Maritime Provinces.
Hoaouiablo senators, I want to emphasize
the faet that it is oniv fair dhat I should
eIxpress what I know to ho the feling of eastcrn
fe, dors and farmers. The, certainiy consider
that their production of iivostock bas been
greatiY aided by their being enabied to get
mciii fceds and coarse grains from the West.
It is for, that reason, hionourabie senators, that
I support our honourable leader with respect
to this amendient to Section 5. I do not think
the Senate should accept it. If we do, we
shall be fiiifiliing the wislh expressed by honourable soiaators of saving the government of the
province of Manitoba from taking action. If
they want to take action, we shall have to
abide by their decision; but I do not think it
is righit for us to, step in and save them from
their difficuity.
I think this legisiation is sounid, and I would
lot it go through. The record of the Wheat

Board during the war years convinees me that
its decisions ilh be fair. WVe heard its representatives in the committee, and I think every
member ixas satisfied that the Wheat Board
was fair in its regulation of the handiing of
wheat interprovincialiy. I arn satisfied that
ne botter body couled be found at the present
time te deal withi this situation.
I do net kn.ow tiiat I need say more. I
haveo statcd Loy opinion, and I support oýur
leader in asking tiiat this amendaient be net
concurrcd in.
Hon. A. L. BEAUBIEN: Honourable senators, it is net mv intention te speak at any
gireailcngîth. andt I w ouid eot have ri:.on if
my honourabic fricnd fromn Queens (Hoýn. Mr.

think, ducs 'iny meiibr froi Manitoba whe
îoppostd te Section 5.
I come frein a district in the province of
Manicoha wbiceh is a vciv largo prodi <or of
ca-e rauns. I have a great deai of respect
for chic'MWhtiat Board, wciich I know is miagcu by the bost men obtainobie, but if the
coarse grains are put undler the huard the
,itîtation ili ece mutenable. The rcmiarks
of my heonourai)le fretd froîti P'rince Edo-ard
kLa!nd (Hon Mr. Sinclair) indicate clearly te
aue t lat hoe is iii faveur of hiaving the board
control oats anud barley in erder that the farmcr- of eaý,tern Canada may have chîcaper feed
for- their stock.
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: I beg yeur pardon,
I mode ne sueli stat-ement.
lIon. A. L. BEAUBIEN: My henourable
fricndi diii net make that statemeat in se rnany
ixoruis, btît I am sure bis reason for waating
cats andi barley put undor the Whoat Board
i. net that easterai farmers shotild. pay a higher
pnie for coarse, grains.
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: I stated cieariy that
ccir farmors wore ejuite agrecabie te having
the boardi fix a price that wvecld give a profit
te the prodcers in western Canada.
Hon. A. L. BEAUBIENý': I wouid remind
my honourable friend that for a gond many
years a lot of our coarse grains have been
made available teo conscimers in eastern
Canada at a iew cost because the government
used the taxpayýers' meoney te take care of the
cost of transportation. The district in which
I have lived for the greater part of my life
is a hieavy producer of oats and barley, and
I know that the people there want an epen
market fer wiîatever surplus of timese grains
thev may liave te soul. They wecild like access

MARCH 24, 1948

to the American market, where they could get
the best price possible.
Hon. Mr. HORNER: What about your
malting barley that you could sell in the
United States?
Hon. A. L. BEAUBIEN: We grow a great
deal of malting barley in my district and in
the province of Manitoba, -and we could get
a large premium for it in the United States.
If oats and barley are controlled by the Wheat
Board there will be a conflict of views between
the feeders and the purchasers. I do not see
how that could be avoided. Up to a short
time before the last war eastern farmers did
not want our oats and barley, because they
claimed that these grains infested their land
with weeds, but as soon as the grains became
available at a low price because freight charges
were paid by the state, they became eager to
purchase 'them.
I do not like to go against the wishes of
my leader (Hon. Mr. Robertson), for whom
I have a great deal of respect, but as my own
people and many of the producers in
Manitoba-and that is where a large percentage of the coarse grains is produced-are
opposed to having oats and barley put under
the Wheat Board, and not one of them has
requested that section 5 be passed, I intend
to support the amendment made by the committee on Banking and Commerce.
Hon. Mr. DUPUIS: May I ask the honourable member a question, just for my own
information? I itake it from his remarks that
he has great confidence in the Wheat Board.
Despite that, is he afraid that the Wheat
Board would not fix a price profitable to the
western farmers?
Hon. A. L. BEAUBIEN: What I am afraid
of is thalt the plaoing of oats and barley under
the jurisdiction of the Wheat Board would
cause conflicting opinions between different
parts of the country and thereby destroy the
high respect in which the Wheat Board is held
today. Suppose, as was suggested by the
honourable leader opposite (Hon. Mr. Haig),
that Ontario produces 200 million bushels of
coarse grains, which is the goal of the
Minister of Agriculture. Those grains would
not come under the Wheat Board, and you
can imagine the controversy that would result
from placing the western production only
under the board.
Hon. R. B. HORNER: Honourable senators, may I say a few words? The lawyers
have talked about this bill that affects the
western farmer, and we have heard about the
views of the Federation of Agriculture. I am

sorry to have to say this, but even if a practical farmer does belong to an agricultural
organization he never knows that it has had
a meeting until at least the day afterwards,
because he is too busy to attend. At the time
of the strike by the United Farmers in Saskatchewan I was told that I could not draw
wheat, as I was a member of that body. I
asked when I had joined, and I learned that
the municipality had taken advantage of provincial legislation and paid $200 to cover
membership for everybody in the community.
However, at the next meeting of the reeves
and councils of the rural municipalities of
Saskatchewan that action was repudiated.
Some of the men at the head of the federation
are personally known to me, and I was familiar
with their activities when they were farming.
I can inform the Senate that they are doing
much better in their present occupation than
they did as farmers. I venture to say that
the practical farmer, the rugged individual
farmer, is not a member of any of these
organizations. I am told that the leader of
the farmers' organization in Alberta is farming a quarter section, of which seventy acres
are under cultivation.
I listened to what was said by the honourable senator from Queen's (Hon. Mr. Sinclair).
Of course, his main object is to have oats and
barley shipped across the country and made
available in his province at the lowest possible price. I should think it would be
cheaper for the government to move the
honourable gentleman out west where the oats
and barley are grown.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. HORNER: With all due deference to the Wheat Board, may I ask what
it has been doing but carrying out the policy
laid down by the government? At country
fairs we have all seen various kinds of
mechanical games that appear to give the
players a good chance for their money, but
we know that they are so designed that the
operators cannot lose. The Wheat Board has
been operating pretty much a game of that
kind. Right now the world is crying for
wheat. How different it was when the price
for No. 1 Northern at Fort William was $1.45
or less, which meant about a dollar to the
grower after the freight and so on had been
paid.
It has often been said that the pioneer
western farmer was a great gambler. He had
to contend with all the elements-hail, rust,
drought and everything else. I know men
who staked the last dollar they could borrow
to seed hundreds of acres, because they

SENATE

figured that when the cr-op was harvested
there rnight be such a dernand for wheat that
they could make a good profit. But today,
after our producers have run ail
tHe risks,
tbey are flot allowed to sell on thcr open
market; they must accept the price set by
the Wheat Board.
Perhaps very few honourable senators know
anything about a game called poker. 1 amn
sure rny honourable friends from St. Jean
Baptiste (Hon. Mr. Beaubien) and Winnipeg
(Hon. Mr. Haig) know littie about cards.
Perbaps I should explain the garne to thern.
Poker is played this way: you bold your cards,
the ante is placed in the centre of the table
and if you thinýk you have a strong enough
hiand you raise the ante. The farmer of the
West is in the position of a poker player with
a strong hand-the book says that opportunity
cornes to every man-but somebody cornes
-in and kicks over the table. That in effeet is

what happens to the western farmers and that
is why s0 many of them are leaving the farms
and going into the contracting or shipping
business. I was a supporter of the Wbeat
Board when it was inaugurated, but the
original purpose of the board was to cstablish
orderly marketing and to prevent a cluttering
up of the channels of trade.
As to barley and oats, they have been sold
to some extent intraprovincially. For instance,
if my neighbour's land is suitable for wheat,
and I arn growing oats, hie wilI buy my oats
for feed.
I do not think the practical farmer is asking
for this type of legislation at the present time,
and therefore I arn opposed to it. We in
the West who grow the grain are naturally
anxious to get a fair price for oats and barley,
but unless the government subsidizes us, or
pays the freight, we cannot sel! our grain cheap
to the people in the East.
I shall vote for the amendment.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Question!

Excise Tax Act.
The bill was read the first time.

DIVORCE BILLS

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON moved the second
reading of the bill.
He said: Honourable senators, this bill deals
with the excise taxes announced by the Minister of Finance on November 17, 1947 as one
aspect of the emergency program to conserve
our rapidly dwindling supplies of foreign
exehange. It will be recalled that a 25 per
cent excise tax is imposed on a variety of
electrical, sporting and luxury goods, that
excise taxes on a sliding scale are imposed on
passenger automobiles in accordance with their
value, and that the sales tax on domestic gas
and electricity is repealed, as is the excise tax
on sugar and syrups.
The main purpose of these taxes is to terrporarily discourage the sort of expenditure
which. adds to our imports from the United
States. Most of the goods concerned are produced in Canada in substantial volume and
have a large United States dollar content.
Practîcally ahI of themn are on the prohibited
or quota lists. If the taxes had flot been
imposed, the Canadian manufacturer of electrical appliances, for instance, might have
expanded his produetion to fili the gap created
by the restriction of imports from 'United
States competitors. This expansion would have
meant buying more component parts in the
United States, thus defeating the purpose of
the import restrictions.
In addition, the imposition of the tax helpa
to prevent discrimination against regular suppliers of these goods in the United States and
their dealer organizations in this country.
Finally, the taxes ensure that any shortages of
supply of these goods in Canada, through the
cutting off of United States imports, leads
ta increased public revenue rather than to
higher prices and higher profits for domestic
producers.
It is admitted that the effect of these taxes
is hard on our own producers of the goods
in question, because they brmng about a reduction in output and employment; but hard as
this may be, i view of the serious exchange
situation it is necessary in the public intereist
of this country.
The chief criticismn I have heard of these
taxes is that they were announced while parliamient was not ini session. For that the gos'-

SENATE
ernment takes full responsibility. It was felt
that the taxes were a vital part of the whole
dollar-saving program, and that it was absolutely impractical to announce them as applying only when parliament gave its approval.
To the extent that the procedure was a
departure from traditional way of doing
things, -the government feels that the existing
emergency and the attendant circumstances
fully justified the course of action followed.
Hon. JOHN T. HAIG: Honourable senators, I (o no't intend to delay the house, but
I may say that I am a little shocked to see
a Liberal government imposing a tax of this
prohibitive nature. The longer you live -the
more you learn-and you can never tell what
even a Liberal government will do.
Hon. Mr. COPP: Usually the right thing,
of course.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Well, I do not know
about that. If I were an employee of one of
the plants manufacturing goods affected by
this bill and were going to ose my job, I
would be very unhappy. Up to the 17th of
November there was a considerable stockpîile
of these goods on hand, but I am persuaded
that by the first of July they will start to run
out and the difficulties will then follow.
I was not encouraged by the views recently
expressed in comemittee on the exchange situation, and I am further persuaded that unless
the American government places certain funds
for use in Canada under the Marshall plan,
we are going to have a real struggle. Furthermore, I do not consider that any of the proposed amendments to this bill will help very
materially. I feel that the situation may prove
serious if, as is suggested by Senator Taft, for
intance, the United States impose certain
r, strictions on the expenditure of money. I am
p d going to take the view expressed by my
party in the other house, but I do criticize the
government because, although it knew a year
ago that our surplus of American dollars was
running out, it allowed our people to continue
buying capital goods across the border at high
prices. The government's explanation is that,
because of the Geneva Trade Agreements, it
did not want to break off relations with the
United States. My judgment is that the
government
should
have conserved our
exchange. I do not believe the minister had
a bit of authority to do what be did, but I do
not criticize him, because he could not have
done anything else.
Though I am not in faveur of the bill, I am
willing that it be given second reading.

CUSTOMS TARIFF BILL
FIRST READING

A message was reccived from the House of
Commons with Bill 173, an Act to amend the
Cistoms Tariff.
The bill was read the first time.
SECOND READING

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON moved the second
rcading of the bill.
He said: Honourable scnators, the purpose
of this bill

is to reduce friom tîrte cents to

two cents a pound, the customs ttriff on coffee
imported under the intermediate tariff. In
recent ycars importations under this classification have represented the larger part of our
coffee imports.
The second, change made by the bill is to
redluce the tariff from four cents a pound to
free entry in the case of tea entering under
the British, preferential tariff, and from eight
cents a pound to two cents a pound in the
case of intermediate tariff. Most tea comes
in under the British preferential tariff.
I dio not know that I can add anything more
in explanation of this bill, but I do express
the hope that the reduction in the tariffs will
commend itself to the universal opinion of
the house.

the 31st of March, 1949.

SECOND

READING

Hon. WISHART
MeL. ROBERTSON:
Honourable senators, with leave of the Senate
I move the second reading of this bill now.

MARCH 24, 1948
It is presented in accordance with the custom
of anticipating, after the estimates have been
brought down, that the public services will
require certain sumes of money before it is
likely that parliament will have passcd the
estimates in total. The purpose of this bill
is to provide one-.sixth of ail the items to be
voted in the main estimates for the fiscal ycar
1948-49. This would secmn to be a sum not
exceeding $179,134,768.66. Then there is an
additional one--th-ird of certain items to provide
for payment for services within the first few
months cf thie year. These items are referred
to in Sehedule A to the bill. They apply
to three departments: Agriculture, External
Affairs, and Trade and Commerce. The agriculture item is for freiglit assistance on western
feed grains. The termination of the crop year
on July 31 will have the effeet of concentrating
the bulk of claim.s eoming due for payment
under this policy into the first quarter
of the fiscal year, requiring that a substantial
adýditionah amount be providcd for this purpose.
The item for the Department of
External Affairs is to cover general postUNRRA relief, this being a re-vote cf the
uncxpended amou-nt of the $20 million provichcd in 1947-48. The Trade and Commerce
item is for an amount. of $450,000 te provide
fer the CanadWan International Trade Fair to
be held in Toronto frein May 31 te June 12
this year. The early date at which this fair
is being helýd makes it necessary te provide
funds te cover expenses of preparation. The
amouint te be granted under Schedule A
appears te be S2,965,800.33.
The bill provides an additional one-sixth of
certain special items te -cover services of a
seaýsonal and sessional nature on which
heaviest payments faîl due in the carly part
of the year. These items, whieh are shown
in Schedule B te the bill, include additionaI
requirements for general administration of the
Senate and House of Commons, and heavy
expenses on national parks and historie sites in
the early part cf the year, in preparation for
the tourist season. The ameunt granted by
Schedule B is $1,462,158.50.
The bill also provides an additional onetwelfth cf certain other items similar te those
referred te in Schedule B but requiring a
'lesser proportion. These are set out in
Sehedule C, which grants the sum of
$2,037,567.83.
Henourable senaters will understand that
the sums te be veted by the bill will in effect
cever the cost of public services fer twe
months of the ceming fiscal year, and aIse
certain additional items te which I have
referred.

319

Hon. Mr. HORNER: I do net suppose the
honourable leader is able te tell us the exact
amount being voted te cover freight on the
shipment of feed grains te Prince Edward
Island. I imagine that item is net set eut
separately.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I have net that
figure before me, and if I had I feel sure that
it would be dwarfed by certain figures for
Saskatchewan.
Hon. JOHN T. HAIG: Honourable senators, I suggest that my honourable friend from
Blaine Lake (Hon. Mr. Horner) wouid be
more likely te get that information fromn the
railway estimates.
The sum. te be voted by this bill is of course
net one-sixth of the total expenditures on
public services, because some of these expenditures arc paid out of conselidated revenue,
under statutory authority.
I have always disliked the practice ,,f ýending over an interim supply bill te the Senate
.iust before the end of a fiscal year, and ever
since I have been hýere I have reserved the
right te make further cemments when the
general estimates came down. In the hast
three days probably more legislation has been
sent over here than in the previeus three
months. No doubt a similar complaint has
heen made at least eighty times in the hast
eighty years. It is impossible for the Senate
te deal intelligently with legishation under
these circumstances, and the procedure makes
our discussion appear stupid. It se happens
that owing te the kindness cf the Clerk I was
handed a copy cf this bill yesterday, but
I saw other bills only just before they were
introduccd here. It may be eut of order for
me te do se, but with the consent of the house
I will say that 1 think the other lieuse lias tee
many measures under consideration at one
time, and therefore is unable te bring discussion on individual measures te an early
cenclusion.
When the customs tariff and excise bis
were before us 1 kept quiet.
I admit quite
candidly that I am net able te state what
effeet this legishatien will have upen the
business cf the country, but it would have
been a goed thing if seme ef our members
who are industrialists had develeped this peint.
The bald statement that we think the legisha..
tien is neeessary, does nlot convince the people.
1 believe that by reason of the delay in
handling hegishatien the Parliament ef Canada
loses seime of its usefulness. When I complain
of a bill ceming befere us juBt as we are about
te adjeurn, I know the answer of seme honourable members wihl be that we can sit here ahi

SENATE

next week. That could be done, but the
House of Commons would not be sitting, and
if those of us who have some distance to
travel are to be home for Good Friday we
have to get going soon. I am not criticizing
the government or the honourable leader in
this house, but I do think that legislation
should come here in a more steady stream.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I thank my honcurable friend for bringing to my attention a
point that I had overlooked. I must say that
the passage of this bill will not prejudice the
rights and privileges of any member to discuss and criticize any item in the estimates
which will come up from time to time during
the balance of the session. The usual undertaking is hereby given that such rights and
privileges will be respected, and will not be
curtailed or restricted in any way as a result
of the passage of this measure.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the second time.
THIRD READING

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON moved the third
reading of the bill.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the third tirme, and passed.
BUSINESS OF THE SENATE
Honourable
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON:
senators, I arm advised that the one remaining
piece of legislation to be considered is the bill
covering the supplementary estimates. I have
asked the acting whip (Hon. A. L. Beaubien)
to advise me of the latest developments in
the other house, and he will be back in a
moment or two. If the bill is not ready to
corne here, the only alternative is to adjourn
during pleasure, to reassemble at the call of the
bell.
In the meantime I may say to honourable
senators that there is no business on our Order
Paper which requires immediate attention.
Honourable members will recall that we gave

second reading to the Canada Shipping Bill,
and that it was referred to the Standing Com-

mittee on Transport and Communications.
There will be some further hearings in connection with that measure, but certain notice

is required so that the i.nterested parties can
be present to appear before the committee.
Following the Easter recess I should like the
Committee on Transport and Communications

to be prepared to meet on the morning of
Tuesday, April 20. The date fixed for the first

meeting of the Divorce Committee is Monday,
April 19.

To facilitate the business of the house, I

will now move that when this house adjourns
it stand adjourned until Monday, April 19,
at 8 o'clock in the evening.
The motion was agreed to.
The Senate adjourned during pleasure.

The sitting was resumed.
APPROPRIATION BILL No. 2
FIRST READING

A message was received from the House of
Commons with Bill 184, an Act for granting
to HRis Majesty certain sums of money for
the public service of the financial year ending
the 31st March, 1948.
The bill was read the first time.
SECOND

READING

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON moved the second
reading of the bill.
He said: Honourable senators will recall that
it is customary at this time of year to present
end-of-the-year supplementaries. These are
being submitted to the house as incorporated
in this bill. The total requirement is in the
sum of $79,809,338, of which $73,331,873 is
included under normal services and $6,477,465
under demobilization and reconversion.
There are a number of unusual items wich

largely account for the total of $79,809,338.
The first, and largest, is to provide for deficits
on certain accounts of the Canadian Wheat
Board pursuant to guarantees given by the
Government of Canada: $31,500,000. Honourable senators w'ill bear in mind that this item,
although payable to the Wheat Board, has
nothing to do with the ordinary purchases

and sales of wheat.

It arises from the fact

that the Wheat Board acted as agent of the
government in connection with the various

appropriations made from time to time during
the past year for the equalization funds in

respect of the differences in sale prices, and
other items relative to various agricultural
products.
The

additional

amount required for the

government's contribution to the Unemployment Insurance Fund is $5,000,000.
The Canadian National Railways deficit
for the calendar year 1947 is $15,885,000.
Additional amounts for subsidies on feed
grains, including freight assistance, amount to
$10,550,000. Speaking only from memory, and
for the information of the honourable senator
from Blaine Lake (Hon. Mr. Horner), I recal
having read' that this particular appropriation
redounds te the credit and to the advantage

MARCH 24, 194831
of the producers of feed grains in the West,
particularly those in Saskatchewan.. However,
1 do flot vouch for the story.
Bon. Mr. BORNER: I do flot admit that!
Hon. Mr. ROBERTS ON: Additional payments to or for veterans and their dependents
amount to $5,827,000. These varions items
total 868,762,000. There are other smaller
amounts.
Hon. Mr. H*AIG: I shoulcl like to ask a
question of which, probably, I should have
given. notice. I observe that the Canadian
National Railways deficit for 1947 is over
815,000,000. That amount, I understand, does
not include capital expenditures for replacements, as to which there are, I believe, no
reserves. Does the government leader know
what those expendtures amount to?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I arn not in a
position et this time to answer my honourable
friend's question.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I should like to have that
information the next time the matter is before
the Senate.
Hou. Mr. ROBERTSON: Perhaps the
question could be asked when these items are
before the Finance Committee.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the second time.
THIRD

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON moved the third
read-ing of the bill.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was

APPENDIX
Province of Manitoba
Office of the Premier
Winnipeg, March 18, 1948.
The Right Honourable C. D. Howe, P.C.,
Minister of Trade and Commerce,
Ottawa, Ontario.
Dear Mr. Howe: . . . . (After referring to
Mr. Howo's statements in the House of
Commons, Mr. Garson went on to say):
Our experiene wiith complementary legislation has not always been too satisfactorv.
The Doninion bas at its disposal all the facts
in the domestic and international environments which bear upon the wisdom of the
legislation which it passes. We do net necessarily or usually have these facts wien under
pressure of time we are calied upon te give
effect by provincial legislation to a federal
policy in the formation of whicli we have net
been consulted.
In the presont case we desire to avoid
getting into suci a situation; and that is why
we are writing this letter to you. We would
like to know the facts and the reasoning upon
which your legislation is based, the results
that it is intended to accomplish, the Canadians whon it is intended to benefit, tise
Canadians who it is intended shall pay the
major cost of lit, and in general all of tEe
information which we would gather as a
matter of routine before even commencing to
think about the drafting of Manitoba legislatien. We should have this information in time
that we can give it adequate and careful consideration; for if we pass complementary
legislation to your own, your policy becomes
our policy and we have to justify it. as our
policy.
Since reading about your proposed plan in
the newspapers we have given some consideration to this matter. It nay clarify our joint
understanding of the matter if we set out
here some of our tentative impressions.
The Canadian Wheat Board Act of 1935
set up the Wheat Board as the voluntary
agency of the wheat producers, charged with
the fiduceiary responsibility to secure for
farmers who shipped wheat to it the best price
available consistent with the promotion of the
sale and use of Canadian wheat in world
markets; and until the change made by Orderin-Council in 1945 all the business of the
Board was conducted on this basis.
During the war, on September 28, 1943, by
Order-in-Council P.C. 7942 your government
provided that the Wheat Board was to become

a compulsory agency or monopoly where it
had formerly been a voluntary agency; and
that it was to become the agent of the Crown,
instead of continuing as it had been the agent
of the wheat producers. Later in 1947, the
provisions of this Order-in-Council were incorporated into tho provisions of the Wheat
Board Act where they now appear as Section
4, s.s.(2), reading as follows:
4. (2) The Board is for all parposes an agent
of His Majesty in the right of Canada and its
poweis under this Act may be exercised by it
nly as an agency of His Majesty in the said
r ig ht.
In 1917 anotier provision was insierted in
the Act which also had been previously
covered by Order in Couneil in Section 4,
s.s. (3), paragraph (j), reading as follows:
4. (3) The Board is incrporated with the
object of narketing in an orderly manner in
interprovincial

and export trade, grain grown

in Canada, and sball possess the following
powers:
(j) te act as agent for or on behalf 0 f any
ninister or agent of His Majesty in right of
Canuadia in respect of any operations that it may
be directed to carry out by the Governor in
Coiuscil; andThe effect of these provisions in practice
was that the Wieat Board was changed from
being an agency of the wheat producers
charged witi responsibility for getting the best
possie price, te an agency of the governsuent, getting a price which would be fixed
by the government, that is a political price,
using that phrase in its best sense. Since
1943, when the Wheat Board was changed
from being an agency of the wheat growers te
being an agency of the governmsent, the price
paid to Canadian farners for their wheat bas
been determined as a matter of government
po]icy in the light of such considerations as
the food agreements with Great Britain and
ti advantages of holding down the cost of
living in Canada, and doubtless other equally
worthwhile reasons.
Our information is that at the present time
the two main factors which affect the present
price of oats and barley are, in the order of
their importance:
First, the fact that the government has imposed a general ban upon the export of oats
and barley from Canada, including shipments
to the United States. Since the domestic
demand for oats and barley has not been
sufficient to absorb the crop, there is a surplus
of oats and barley in the Canadian market
at the moment, which certainly cannot have

MARCH 24, 1948
a good effect upon the price, and probably
has had a bad eue.
Second, the government bas maintained in
effeet an embargo upen the shipment of livestock into the American market. Tbis leaves
the only practical export outiet that under
the British cantracts. These British cantracts,
therefore, establish the price of aur pork, beef,
poultry aud dairy produets. The prices ou
tbese animal produets affect the prices of such
oats and barley as the livestock raiser will
use for feed, because the quautity of animal
praduets wbich bie eau seil and tbeir price will
affect the amount of feed grains which hie
will buy and the price bie eau afford to pay
for them.
Tbe bolding down of the Canadian cost of
living and the embargo upon the exports of
farm produets ta the United States are
examples of policies which are intelligible and
perhaps wise. But they are also national
policies, tbe cost of carrying out which should
be paid, in aur opinion, by the whole body
of the Canadian people and net by the Canadian farmers ouly.
What we would like te kuow is wbetber in
tbe legislatien wbich you will ask us ta complement, these saine principles or policies will be
followed witb regard ta oats and barley? Is
the Wbeat Board te be the agent of the producer of oats and barley, charged with the
responsibility of securing the best price passible in ail available outlets? Or is tbe board
ta be the agency of tbe government, buyiug
oats and barley at a price set by the goverument, fer reasons net necessarily related to,
and even incompatible with the securing .of tbe
best price? Is tbe price te be set, for example,
at a certain level to keep down the cost of
living in Canada or ta provide livestock
raisers witb feed at a reasonable figure? Iu
tbis latter case, if tbe Wbeat Board fixed a
price for oats and barley below wbat tbey eau
be sold for, will tbe resulting loss be left with
the producer of tbe oats and barley? Or will
this loss be paid by tbe wbole Canadian
people? To put tbis in another way, will it be
the policy of the Wheat Board in handling
oats and barley ta hold down the price ta tbe
buyer of tbem by open or bidden subsidies?
If so, wbo will pay the subsidies, the producer
of eats and barley or the federal gaverument
representing and taxing the whole body of
the Canadian people?
At the present tîme aur expart trade in oats
and barley is shut off by a general expert ban.
Some of aur traditional markets for oats and
barley, particularly malting barley, have been
passed by for some time in the interests of
maintaiuîng a supply of feed grains in Canada
in order ta meet the requirements of the

323

British contracts and aur domestic needs in
the- production of animal products. Our trade
to Great Britain is regulated by government
agreements which fix our prices for our wheat,
beef, park, poultry and dairy products. As
long as these conditions continue, it would be
relatively easy for the Wheat Board to set the
price for oats and barley; for the Wheat
Board could net get any greater price than
these government policies will make possible, even if it were acting as the agent
cf the producer of oats and barley. But the
prire Sa determined would net necessarily be
fair ta the producer and could be most unfair.
Let us suppose, bowever, that the time cornes
when it is impossible or unwise ta renew these
British contracts and to maintain this expert
ban. In such a case we should have ta seek
a re-establishmeut of our former expert markets for oats and barley and their products.
If at that time the Wheat Board were the
agent of the producer of oats and barley, it
would be under obligation ta get fer him the
best price available for bis oats and barley in
the export and Canadian markets. If, on the
contrary, the Wheat Beard would fix the price
in accerdance witb the gevernment's instructions; but with expert markets aý,ailable, surely
it would do se in some kind ef relatien ta
market prîces in the expert and Canadian
markets? In such event, under your proposed
paliey and legislation, who will defray the
differeuce. if any. between the market price
and the Wheat Board price, the natian or the
preducer of eats and barley?
At tbis point may we ask the question "What
other preduet of Canada, either primary or
secondary, is the geverument geing ta fix the
price of and leave the burden of carrying
the differeuce between the government price
aud the market price upen the producers of
thiese products?" If this is a good policy for
wheat and pork and beef and poultry products, and now oats aud harley, why is it net
a geod policy for copper, newsprint, flsb, tractors and farm implemeuts? This is a question
with whicb we are likely ta be confronted in
the passage of our complementary legisiation.
Auswers te the followieg questions would
also be most belpful ta us in decidiug whether
we sheuld pass provincial legislation complemeutary te your owe:
(1) [s it the intention in the fairly near
future ta relieve the pressure on the market
of the extra supply of aats and barley in
Canada by lifting the present ban upan their
expert?
(2) Is it the intention in the fairly near
future ta lift the embargo upon the shipment
of Iivestock praducts into the United States?

324

SENATE

(3) What technical methods are going to be
uscd in the handling and marketing of oats
and barley under this proposed new arrangement? Are you going te use ail the existing
organizations and superimpose upon them the
Whea+ Board operations? Or are you going
to substitute the Wheat Board operations for
some part of the present handling?
(4) To what extent do you propose te restrict exports in the interests of maintaining in
Canada what the goveroment may regard as a
suflicient quantitv of oats and barley for ferding purposes? How will the Wheat Board as a
matter of goveromental policy make allocation
as between these demestic requiremehts and
experts? What wvill its pricing policy be on
the feed grains censumed in Canada in relation to the prices availablo in the Canadian
or expert markets?
(5) If in the interests of national policy and
for the Canadian people as a wvbole, the price
of oats and barley is set at a level which is
less than would otherwisc b'e available, and it
is not the intention under your legis]ation to
have the whole Canadian people make up thep
differonce belwcon those two prices, by what
arguments do you and cao ne justifv this
course?
(6) We would like te, hiaxe a copy of the
legal opinion upon wbich you base your view
that provincial legisiation complcrnentary to
your own is ncar.If

of local marketing an ancillary to centrol of
interprovincial and expert trade, shou'ld net
aise be valid? We weuld like yen to assure
us that iii passing complcrnentary legisiation
we would flot be invoking the provincial jurisdiction unnecessarily.
(7) If cumpleîuentary legislation ho required
frem Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba,
in whichi large quantitios of oats and barley
are grown and also large quantities would ho
purchased from the Wheat Board, why would
complementary 'legislation net bo rcquired from
Ontario and Quebec, in which large quantities
of eats and barley are grown and also largo
quantities would hoe purchased from the Wheat
Board? Hlave you secured a legal opinion
upen this peint, and if se, may we have a copy
of it? In the absence of cemplementarv logislation from Ontario and Quebec, hoiw would

of this sort.? Lot us suppose that with a botter
than average crep of oats and barley in both
western Canada and eastern Canada, that there
were a short crop of corn for feeding purposes
'n the UJnited States such as would make the
American market an attractive outlet for our

Upon your assumption that
provincial cemplementary legislation is essential,- would the absence of complementary
legislatien in Ontario and Quebec beave you
in a position in which the Ontario and Quehec
producers of oats and barley could expert
thieir production te the United States for the
American price and replace the saine with
western Canadian oats and barley purchased
from the XVheat Board at what might ho a
lewer price fixed hy that body. Inoether words,
if complementary provincial legislation he
necessary. what would ho the legal and practical effeet, if it were net provided in Ontario
and Quebec?
Without the information herein requested it
is impossible for us te give this mest important matter the careful and adequate cons;ideratien which it should have fromn us.

Dear Mr. GarsonI wish te acknowledge your letter of March

I believe that the facts in support of this
legislation are as well known te you as they are
te mie. The Canadian Federation of Agriculturc, purporting te represent the v iew s of the
considerable majority cf farmers in western
and etr
Canada, bas recommendcd the
plncing of the marketing of coarse grains under
the Canadian Wheat Board. In our discussions
withi the Canadian Federatien of Agriculture,
thec' have indicated the need of cemplementary
legislation by the legislatures of the three
prairie prov inces, and have urged the early
passage cf legislation on our part in erder that
the provincial legislatures may act while they
are presently in sessien.
I have ne deubt that the representatiens
that have been made te the federal gevernment
have also been made te the Goveroment of

DAIRY INDUSTRY BILL
REPLY

TO INQUIRY

Hon. WISHART
McL. ROBERTSON:
Before the orders of the day are called, I would
remind honourable senators of a verbal question which the honourable senator from
Waterloo (Hon. Mr. Euler) asked me some
time before our recent adjournment. It was
to this effect:
In this morning's Citizen I note an article
whieh says that the government is now informed
by the officers of the Departmrent of Justice that
it is not required by the Geneva agreements to
remove the ban on the importation of margarine.

As this is in direct contradiction te a statement
made in the Trade Relations Committee by the
government officials who negotiated the agreements, I would ask the leader of the government
if lie can tell the Senate which statement is
correct?
Honourable senators, since this question was
asked. I have ascertained that an opinion was
sought and secured from the law officers of
the Crown as to whether or not, under the
terms of the Geneva Trade agreements,
Canada was specifically requircd to remove
the ban on the importation and sale of margarine. I have been advised that their opinion
is that Canada is not required to remove
such ban.
I am not in a position to answer the specific
question asked by the honourable senator from
Waterloo (Hon. Mr. Euler) as to which is
correct, the opinion of the law officers of the
Crown or the statement of the government
officials to whom he referred in his inquiry.
I doubt if my personal view is what he desires.
As my honourable friend has been a member
of the government for so many more years
than I have. I should think he would be fully
aware of the procedure frequently followed
when questions arise, namely, of seeking the
view of the Department of Justice as to legal
interpretations.
SECOND

READING

FIRST READING

The Senate resumed from Wednesday,
February 18, the adjourned debate on the
motion of Hon. Mr. Euler for the second
reading of Bill B, an Act te amend the Dairy
Industry Act.

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON presented Bill J-7,
an Act to amend the Yukon Quartz Mining
Act.
The bill was read the first time.

Hon. A. C. HARDY: Honourable senators,
I am somewhat loath to interject myself into
the place of the honourable senator from
Grandville (Hon. Mr. Bouffard), but as this

YUKON QUARTZ MINING BILL

APRIL 20, 1948
item has been standing on the Order Paper
for some two months or more, I think we
should do what we can to dispose of it.
I have flot moved in this matter before
because, if 1 had intervened, the member who
adjourned the debate and is flot present to
,carry on would flot only lose his place, but
the privilege of spe-aking to the motion at ail.
I have no doubt, however, that the Senate will
flot stand in the way of the honourable senator from Grandville-who is a very distinguished member of this bouse and of his own
ommunity-speaking on the matter if and
-%when hie su desires.
This is the third time this bill bas been
before the Senate. As it bas already been
thorougbly discussed, flot on.ly here but in the
press througbout the country as well as in
all kinds of meetings. there is really flot mueh
to be added, and my remarks will be brief,
because I do flot want to take up the time
of the Senate by reiterating ivhat bae already
been said.
Two years agoï when. a skaular bill to this
was introduoed, one of the great objections
raised to it was that margarine wais not a
wb'olesome f ood. Since that tim-e even the
strongest oppon-ents of me.rgarine -have coinpletely aba*ndoned. that argument, so I shall
flot týake any time in discussing it.
As I see it the only real opposition remaining to the prinjeiple of the bill is that it is
going te do harma te the dairy farmers -of this
country; somne have gone se far as te say
that if it is passed it will ruin. the dedry
farmero fromr on-e end of 'Canada to the other.
As a dairy farmer myseif, I do flot agree with
that -opinion. I do flot think it would do a bit
of haTm. Of course, we are ail1 entitled to our
own opinion, and I recognize the right of
others to, differ froma me sa I would expeet
thema to recogn-ize my right te differ from,
th em.
-Since this bill was firs&t introduced there
have be-en a good many developments. one of
which was toucbed upon this afternoon by the
leader of the government (Hon. Mr. Robertson,). First, there bias been the question of the
entry of Newfoundland into confederation and
the ternis effered by -Canada to that country ini
connection with margarine. That matter and
anether important question, the terme of the
Geneva conferenee, have been discuoeed in
detail, clearly and forcefully, by the sponsor
of this bill (Hon. Mr. Euler), and it would
,only be a waste of time for me to eay anything furtber about them. However, even
since the bill was introduced in the present
session, there has been another important
development-the very high soaring of the
price of butter, and an extrsaordinary shortage

of that article, which began about six or eight
weeks ago. I know that in my own home
town butter can scareely be obtained at ail.
If you have "ýpull" with your grocer you may
be able to get baîf a pound, or possibly a
pound. and 1 believe a similar condition exists
th-roughout Ontario. Wbat the condition is
in Quebec and the eastern and western
provinces, I do flot know. In a Montreal
hospital, one of the fineSt in Canada, where
I was called the other day, I noticed that
the butter served for midday dinner weighed
about one-tenth of an ounce. It was the
-ordinary small thin pat, eut dîagonally across.
That was for a patient who needed geod
nouriehing food. On eking if that was ail the
butter served at a meal, I wss told: "Ail the
patients are getting just ther saine quantity.
It is very bard to see, but there is some thlere'
N-ow, when hospitals lhike that cannot get
ersough butter, the situation la pretty bad.
As we know, the Parliamentary Restaurant
went without butter a short time ago; and
at luncheon there today we were served something that was called butter, but if there
was not something mixed with it I do not
knýow what butter is.
Hon. Mr. COPP: Maybe margarine is
being brought in.
Hon. Mr. HARDY: I do flot suppose there
was margarine in it, but certainly something
was mixed with the butter. It may have been
water; it tasted much like that.
At the base of this whole matter is the
point that is being raised by the pro-margarine membe-s of the Senate, the question of
the freedom of choice. It amazes me to hear
Liberal after Liberal, men that we know are
real Liberals, getting up and advocating-I
do not say this offensively-this Tory-nfTories kind of prohibition. The Conservative
party went in for beavy prohibition, but even
in its worst days it did no.t go so far as to
ban gond foods; or if it did, the ban did not
last long. I say it is amazing to see men
bea.ring the Liberal label opposing a progressive measure like this and saying that we
cannot buy a perfectly gond, nutritive food,
such as oleomargarine. This point bas been
discussed at length several times.
To my mind the prohibition against margarine is vicious class legisiation. Whenever
class legislation is attacked, those who bave
been en-joying privileges under it immediately
rise to cr "Ruinl" Many members of this
bouse wilI remember the outcry made by the
great agrioultuxral implement fantories in
Canýada w'ben the duty on agricultural implements was reduced to 121 per cent. They

SENATE

coulci fot exist on t.hat. A little later wheri
the duty ivas entirely remox-cd from aguricultural implements the samne cry arose. But
today the ag-ricultural implement, manufacturers are doing very well indecd. lIn fact,
siIICe the duties were takcn off, their factories
hiave bcomc Jauger and Jauger.
Take the automobile industry. In the year
1926 wlheui automnobiles w-eue sclling an from
50 to 100 per cent moire in Canada than in
the United States, the late honourable Mu.
Rlo.b then M\ini-te- of Finance, rcduced the
duties di-atically. It was stated that the
autom-obile industry would be rumncd, and I ain
sure ni:-oy hlonourable senators will remember
the huîgc (1eiionstration that w-as -taged in
fr-ont of these buildings by sevcral thousand

Oui- government intimateil that if that country

The sponsor

dealt m-itba that point fully. lIn answering bim
the bonourable senator from Kennebcc (Hon.

Mr. Vaillancourt), in a very able speech,
dispoed of il b-t saying:
We hav e spoken of Newfoîiadland. Wby bring

APRIL 20, 1948
fill bis speech with so many mistakes. I do
not see what reliance can be put on bis remarks
at ail. I feel that he lias been guided by sorneone with an extraordinary conception of what
a senatar should say wben lie speaks before
tliis bousýe.
Tlie chief objection to the bill now seerns to
be tliat it will ruin the dairy farmers. No consideration ie given to the coneumers. Wben
the lionourable senator from Mount Stewart
(Han. Mr. Mclntyre) wae epeaking in this
debate lie was asked if consideration should not
be given to the consumers in large and congested manufacturing districts. He replied,
"Certainly, I arn coming to that." Hie did
corne to it, and thie is what lie said:
1 have said that I have great regard for the
consuming population of this country, and I
would flot do anything to injure them. But
there is an argument both ways. There is a
strong argument for this bill, but there is also
a strong argument against it.
Tliat is the consideration lie gave to about
2,000,000 working -men as compared with from
370,000 to perbaps 500,000 faa'mers engaged in
the dairy business.
Thaît is the only kind of consideration the
consumer is getting. I have before me a
brochure which lionourable senators may have
seen: it states that there are nearly haif a
million farmers scattered across the provinces,
of whom some 370,000 at saine turne or other
during the year depend on butter for a cash
Teturn. I think we can take that figure as a
fairly accurate approximation to the number of
dairy farmers or operatirs of mixed farms who
deal in dairy products. As against this producer interest, I couid not find any statistics
sliowing the number of workdng men; but a
friend of mine who is largely interested in
manufacturing informs me that there are in
Canada at least 2,000,000 .employed workmen,
including, I suppose, numbers of what we cali
the white-olared clame, people receiving coinparatively smali incarnes. Yet all the consideration theàe people get in this hanse is two
lines froin one speaker and four or five lines
froin another.
Hon. Mr. HORNER: You have te consider
the fsirmers' failies as well.
Hon. Mr. EULER: And the workinen's, too.
Hon. Mr. HARDY: A good many of these
2,000,000 workers have families txo, althougli
they may not be blessed with families such as
that of my honourable friend.
I operate a farm which, thougli of course
not comparable in aTea te saine fairin in the
West, consiste of about 500 acres. It le intensively cultivated, and I carry one of the largest

bords of butter-producing cows in Ontario. 1
will not naine the breed, because I do not wish
to advertise myscîf or it. I have no-t the
slightest fear that the use of margarine would
damnage in the lýeast the successful opera>tion
of rny farin. Mucli of my business cansists
in selling livestock ta farmers who are butter
ýproducers, and I would be the Iast person, I
arn sure, to do anytbing which would barin
their interests. But I do not believe this
measure would injure their interests; and in
any event I amrn ot prepared to forgo niy
Liberal principles.
As regards the shortage of butter, and the
suggestion that it may lie regarded as temporary, I sliould like ta say just a word. The
Minieter of Agriculture stated about six weeks
ago that things would improve in two weeks.
Instead of improving they got worse; taday
they are worse than they have been at any
turne, and I believe there is no chiance of any
improvement. Certainly when the pastures
caine into use we shall have a bigger flow of
m.ilk -and more butter, but the butter supply
will not be sufficlent ta replenish aur reserves.
Those reserves are now very seriously depleted,
and if we are going to consume butter in the
usual quantities we shaîl net be able to. build
up a substantial reserve against next winter.
I believe th-at nine or ten months hence there
will be a worse shortage than w-e have known
up ta the present. That is a inatter which
should be takea inte very serious consideration. Thore is only one way of improving the
situation, and that is for parliament ta pass a
law permitting the manufacture and sale Of
margarine.

Hon. T. A. CRERAR:- Hanaurable senators,
since this matter was under discussion in the
liause as recently as a year ago, there lias been
evident a rapidly increasing interest in -the

SENATE

country in the question of whether the manufacture of and trading in margarine should be
restored to Canadians.
The honourable senator from Waterloo
(Hon. Mr. Euler), in an excellent speech on
the second reading, cited a great deal of evidence which supports the point I have just
made. One can scarcely pick up a newspaper
without seeing a letter or sone reference to
the restoration of margarine as a food for
Canadians. In some cases municipal councils
and labour organizations have passed resolutiens in favour of this course. There lias been
also a noticeable increase in, shall I say,
propaganda against the measure. Certainly
I have no objection to the dairy interests of
Canada putting forward their point of view
and pressing it as strongly as possible; but
much of the effort of the dairy interests has
been directed toward inducing or influencing
members of parliament in their attitude
towards the bill. This also, I suppose, is all
right.
The present discussion is all to the good.
It is the way we settle, or should settle, matters in a democratic society. I dislike pressure
groups, I care not what the group may be.
The development of organizations to exercise
pressure upon the legislative agencies of the
country wholly distorts what should be the
democratic procedure. We legislators exist te
serve the public interest, and to do this
effectively we require the widest possible discussion on measures. And may I add that
that discussion should be on the basis of
reason. When an appeal is made to an emotion, or an effort is made to excite a prejudice,
a disservice is donc to what we call our
democratic society.
It appears to me that a good deal of the
prejudice against margarine today stems back
for almost twenty years. I recall the discussion about New Zealand butter in 1930. It is
quite truc that Canada, along with the United
States and other countries, was entering upon
a rather prolonged period of depression, and
the New Zealand butter agitation happened to
follow shortly after the institution of the
Hawley-Smoot tariff in the United States.
Honourable senators who live close to the
United States border know what the HawleySmoot tariff did to the dairy industry of this
country. It raised duties to prohibitive levels,
and consequently in the Eastern Townships,
the Niagara Peninsula and even in the Winnipeg district and the Fraser Valley of British
Columbia, milk and cream were denied the
United States market, and the dairymen of
this country turned to the production of
butter. It was shortly afterwards that the
New Zealand butter agitation arose. I have

always regretted that, but not because it was
a factor in my personal defeat in the constituency of Brandon in the federal elections of
1930. Twice during that campaign a Brandon
creamery company which, of course, was
stCongly supporting the late Lord Bennett, sent
out announcements reducing the price of cream
to farmers. The reason given was the importation of New Zealand butter and. believe me
honourable senators, that was a very difficult
proposition to face at that time. I mention
this because I do not think that sort of procelure really provides a fair or wise solution to
a problem of this kind.
The Dairy Council of Canada bas been quite
active in pressing its point of view. I have no
fault to -find with it for that; but it must
equally afford to others the right of presenting
their point of view. So long as the Dairy
Council confines itself to argument, I have no
objection whatever; but I object decidely to
the gentle intimation sometimes given that, if
ibis mieasuire goes through, those who support
it in parliament will be marked men. I resent
that sort of tiing with all my being, because it
is a degradation of our whole democratic concept of government.
Is the dairy industry really in danger? That
is the question to which I should like te
address myself for a moment. Will the
manufacture or importation of margarine in
Canada ruin the dairy industry, as is claimed
by many of those who oppose the measure
brought in by my honourable friend froin
Waterloo? What has bren the experience of
other countries? Denmark is particularly a
dairy country, but for many years it has permitted the importation, sale and manufacture
of margarine. I doubt if there is a single
country in the world that goes to the extent
that Canada does, not only in denying the
importation of margarine, but in absolutely
forbidding its manufacture. There is no more
absolute prohibition or application of protective principles than the ban on the importation or manufacture of margarine, and I shall
have a word or two to say in this regard before
I finish. I have given some study to this
matter and I cannot reach the conclusion that
the dairy industry of this country is in danger.
I secured from the Bureau of Statistics some
figures of production and also a distribution
analysis of how this production is utilized in
Canada. I shall not quote them all, but if I
may, I should like te have them placed on
Hansard for the information of the house.
(See appendizes A and B at end of today's
report)
Let me say first that milk production is
the basis for these statistics. Butter may go

APRIL 20, 1948

up or down, but that fact is not necessarily
an accurate criterion of the health of the
industry. The test is milk production. In
1935 the milk production in Canada was a
little over 142 billion pounds. In 1947-I
shall not give the figures for the intervening
years because it would take too much time,
and they will appear on the record-the total
milk production had increased from 14j
billion to almost 171 billion pounds. That
indicates, of course, the healthy state of the
industry.
It is also interesting to note what happened
to this milk production. In that respect
changes have been taking place just the same
as they have been in everything else. In 1935
the percentage of milk production that went
into creamery butter was 35-70 per cent. A
little over one-third of the total milk production went into the manufacture of creamery
butter. In 1947 that amount had increaced to
39-59 per cent. But we have to take in conjunction with that the production of dairy
butter, because that commodity is consumed
not only on the farms where it is produced,
but in many parts of Canada where it enters
into commerce. In 1935 the percentage of
the total milk production used for dairy butter was 15-66; the total for dairy and creamery
butter was 51-36 per cent. In 1947 the dairy
butter proportion had droppd to 7-66 per cent
of the total, and all butter, both creamery and
dairy, accounted that year for 47-25 per cent
of the total milk production.
That is rather striking in face of the fact
that mKlk production between those years
increased by 21 million pounds. Where did
that go? We find that fluid milk consumption
increased from 19-03 per cent in 1935 to 24-18
per cent in 1947. That was an increase of
mor:e than 5 per cent, which ialmost matches
the decrease of 4-11 per cent in butter production between those two years. That of course
Everyone knows the
is undeistandable.
emphasis that has been placed upon mil-k as
human food. Nutritionists everywhere have
been advocating a greater use of milk, especially for children. Indeed, in some of the city
schools in Canada today free milk is being
given to the children. That is 'all to the good.
Is that a bad thing for the dairy industry?
I think it is one of the best things that have
ever happened to the dairy industry. Fluid
milk brings a better price by a consideirable
margin than milk used for the production of
cream that goes into butter. Like my honourable friend from Leeds (Hon. Mr. Hardy),
I was in the dairy business for a number of
years, in Manitoba. On the Winnipeg market
today butter fat is selling at about 76 cents

per pound. If that is translated on ýthe basis
of milk with 3j per cent butter fat, it means
3ý times 76 cents, or $2.66, per 100 pounds of
milk. But in the Winnipeg milk shed today
fluid milk is selling at more than $4 per 100
pounds. Consequently, whenever farmers can
find a market for fluid milk it pays them to
supply to that market and go out of the
pioduction of cream and butter. That tendency is likely to increase.
I have another interesting figure to quote,
and it will be my last one, for I do not like
quoting figures. In 1935 1-28 per cent of the
milk produced was used in concentrated milk
products; that is concentrated milk and, I
presume, canned milk. By 1947 the proportion had increased to 3-87 per cent. What does
that mean, honourable senators? It simply
means that farmers were finding a more profitable outlet for their milk in having it manufactured into concentrated products. Anyone
familiar with the development of our north
ceountry, for instance, knows that the only
kind of milk that can be used there, for consumption lis concentrated and canned milk.
Markets can b developed abroad also for
the same products. To me these figures are
pretty convincing proof that our dairy people
are really crying out before they are hurt.
I should like to see the dairy interests devote
more effort to increased efficiency.
My
honourable friend fron Leeds will confirm
my statement that if you have a herd of cows
whose average production per cow is 3,000
pounds and your neighbour across the road has
a similar herd which averages 5,000 pounds,
he has a much better chance to make money
than you have. The reason is that an animal
producing 5,000 pounds requires no more care
or feed than one giving a much smaller yield.
I know that from my own experience, because
-if I may be pardoned for making a personal
allusion-in my own herd, when I was in the
dairy business, I raised the production per
cow from around 7,000 pounds to over 9,000
pounds; and that made a substantial addition
to the profit. I pay tribute to the excellent
work being done by all the provincial departments of agriculture
and the federal
department in the promotion of sound dairy
practice and the development of healthy dairy
herds. I do not need to dwell on the
nutritional value of margarine. That is now
beyond dispute. The evidence is overwhelming that margarine is almost, if not quite,
equal in nutritional value to butter.
Hon. Mr. EULER: It is just as good.

SENATE

Hon. Mr. CRERAR: My honourable friend
who introduced the measure says that the
evidence is that in nutritional value margarine
is just as good as butter. So margarine cannot be denied on that score. Well, why not
permit its manufacture and importation?
Look at it from the elementary point of
view of freedom that was referred to by my
honourable friend from Leeds (Hon. Mr.
Hardy). Why should I or anybody else be
denied by law of this parliament the right to
buy a wholesome food at say one balf or twothirds the cost of another food that takes its
place?
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: How did my honourable
friend answer that question when he was in
the government.
Hon. Mr. CRERAR: That is a sort of lefthanded argument. If the honourable senator
wants to find out what my position on the
margarine question has been, he can find it in

the House of Commons Debates of the early
twenties. My stand on the matter has not
changed from that date. I was opposed to
the ban then, I have been opposed to it ever
since, and for the reasons I have given, I am
opposed to it now.
There is another point. I think that of all
classes in this country the farmers are the last
class that should ask for protection. My views
on the protective principle in our fiscal policy
are, I think, pretty well known. I do not need
to talk about them. I recall what a penalty
was imposed on western farmers forty years
ago wben there was a duty of 25 per cent
against the importation of agricultural implements from the United States to Canada. In
Manitoba we were barred by that duty from
purchasing implements in Minneapolis, from
where the freight would have been half what
it was on implements from eastern Canada.
That taught me a lesson, honourable senators,
in the principles of freedom of trade which
has remained with me. I cannot bring myself,
even for a moment, ta approve the continuation in our laws of a prohibition against the
manufacture and use of a healthy food. I
think such a prohibition could be criticized
very strongly on moral grounds, if one were
to view it that way; but ta maintain it is
simply to continue an injustice in this country
against hundreds of thousands of consumers.
I believe that if a poll of the opinion in
Canada were taken today we would find it
overwhelmingly in favour of doing away with
this prohibition.
Hon. Mr. EULER: We certainly would.
Hon. Mr. CRERAR: If it were not for the
fear that someone somewhere would endeavour
to exploit margarine to prejudice the people

in the mnatter of elections, there is no doubt
that parliament would accept this proposed
moasure without delay.
I have spoken at some length, and I trust
that I have made clear the rensons why I
propose to vote in favour of the bill. I hope
that it will receive such support in this house
as to make it clear to the people of Canada
that in this matter, at any rate, the honourable Senate stands for frecdom.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. A. N. MeLEAN: Honourable- senators, many of us who have recently been back
to our homes know what it is to be without
butter, whether one has the money to buy it
or not. We have only ta follow the press
despatches to fully realize that the great
masses of the people in this country desire to
buy margarine. Even in the parliamentary
restaurant today the late-comers were served
some kind of white substance instead of
butter. We know not what it was.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: It was cream cheese.
Hon. Mr. MeLEAN: The Senate has performed a great duty in watching over and
endeavouring to protect the rights of minorities; but as to the manufacture and sale of
margarine, I think this is an occasion when
we should stand firmly for the rights of the
masses of the people throughout Canada who
are entitled to buy any good food they choose,
if it can be brought within their reach. The
Senate, I think, should do its part to clear
the way for the sale of a good product that is
desired by the vast majority of our citizens.
The original measure, passed in 1886, was
called the Prohibition of Substitutes for
Butter Act. For health reasons, the doctors
were in favour of the bill at that time, and
their influence carried great weight in effecting
its passage. But the situation has entirely
changed. New scientific processes have been
brought into use, our pure food laws are
among the best anywhere, and the leading
doctors of America today endorse margarine
and fully recognize it as a good and wholesome
food for the people. In this connection may
I quote from a recent despatch printed in the
Montreal Gazette. It is dated Washington,
March 9, and reads as follows:
Dr. H. J. Deuel, Jr., a college professor testified today that "butter is in no way superior
to margarine."
Deuel urged the House of Representatives
agriculture committee to approve legislation removing "restrictive taxes" on oleomargarine.
The committee is holding public hearings on
eighteen bills proposing to end all special federal
taxes on oleo. The dairy industry opposes removal of the levies.
Deuel, professor of nutrition at the University
of Southern California, said he has reached the
conclusion that:

APRIL 20, 194
"Cow's milk fat may be the idea] fat for growing calves but there is no reason to suppose that
a similar superior nutritive value might hold for
the human baby."
Deuel read a British scientific paper saying
that "buman milk fat in regard to its comaponent
acide bas more resemblance ta a typical margarine fat blend than to butter fat."
Without going into too much detail, 1
should like to bring out some important points
in connection with the margarine question. It
seea to me that a great pinciple is involved
in this bill. In a democracy, such as we stand
for in Canada, are the people ta have freedom
of vocation and freedoin of choice? We are
prone ta criticize other nations whose gavernmente thwart the will of the people in these
matters. Why should any one of us assume
the right ta tell aur fellow man what he is
going ta eat or drink, as long as it is good.
Margarine is a nutrîtiaus food, endorsed by
dactors, dietitians and others, and it can be
sold at a price that is reasonable. Ia Newfoundland the average price is about haîf that
of butter.
At Geneva we as a nation -entered into
certain trade agreements with more than
twenty other countries. The agreements are
not perfect. Somne of the deals caverinýg fish
are flot altogether ta my liking, but 1 arn told
that adjustments will have ta await future
negotiations. There is no thought, however,
of our failing to stand by the Geneva agreements as far as fish or other commodities are
concerned. 1 understand that an agreement
was also made ta lift the ban on margarineat least that was the impression given by the
delegates at Gxeneva. We should also stand
by that agreement and flot resort ta the questionable method of placing so high a tariff on
the produat as ta nuilify the deal. If we do,
we cafi expect repercussions in connection
with tariffs on Canadian products which we
desire ta export, and the completion of a
great deal of the work commenced at Geneva
will be placed under a severe handicap.
I arn directly interested ini the dairy industry,
and I should like ta see the sale of fiuid milk
vigorously promnoted. Financially, the farmers
do better by the sale of fiuid milk than by
the sale of ather dairy produets. I was sorry
when the subsidy was taken off milk. I should
like ta have seen it continued. The consurnption of fluid milk amnong growing children
increased. greatly during the war, and an ailout effort should have been made ta continue
the increase. Those of us who have had many
years of experience in commerce feel that
there is an independent market for margarine
at a price level which is lower than that of
butter. Many people can afford margarine
who cannot afford butter. The United States
bas had margarine for many years, andi I do
5853--23

335

not think it has affected the price of butter
very much, if at ail. The price of butter
across the border bas usually been higher than
in Canada.
Those who prepare commodities for sale
know that new markets imrnediately open up
where lower price levels corne into effeat for
goods that are similar to higher .priced
products. Take for instance the fish business,
which I know a little about. Some citizens rnay
nat be able ta buy caviar, oysters, lobsters,
scallops, salmon and other fish which command good prices, but they eu afford herring,
cod, pollock, and so forth, which are ail good
food. Such citizens certainly should neyer
be denied these lower-priced fish when they
fill their needs at a cost within their buying
power.
I rememnber saine years ago when aur east
coast berrings did not have mauch of a sale,
except for sait herrings to be cooked with
potatoes with the jackets on. Some of us
believed herring was as good a food as any
fish; and we found ways and means ta put
up the humble herring and seli it at about haîf
the price of other fish that were better known
and wcll established on the market. Thus an
entirely new market was tapped. Thousands of
housewives who could not afford ta buy the
higher priced fish for their husbands' lunch
pails bought the lower-priced produets, and
millions of tins went into the lunches of mine
workers and others who toil in aur many industries. The increased sale of herring did not
affect the sale of the higher-priced fish, and I
do not believe that in the long run the sale af
margarine would harra the farmer at ail.
Rather, I think its manufacture and sale
wauld aid aur farming communities.
The substance of fat is found in rnany coinmodities which camne directly or indirectly
frora land and sea,, and what country for its
size and population has more land and ses.
than Canada? Fats are found in caw's milk,
soya beans, cottanseed, corn, sunfiower seed,
peanuts, seal ail, whale ail and rnany other
resources of land and sea. It je necessary, of
course, ta refine the fats, but the scientifia
processes of refining thema are now as welI
known as the techniques of refining gold are
and other substances. The farmers of Canada
can profitably produce saine of these fat-producing crops, as the farmers of the United
States are domng. Soya beans have been one
of the most profitable crops acrose the border,
and Canada can produce thema just as succeesfully as the United States. Sunfiower seed is
another profitable crop which. aur farmers
could raise, and seul and whale ail can be
profitably produced on aur northern coaste.
We do not need ta import the ingredients of

SENATE

margarine. Our own producers can have the
market for the raw material, including milk.
In closing, I would emphasize the main
underlying principle of this margarine question. Are we, who are in the position of
honourable senators in a great democracy,
going to give those who have placed us here
the free choice of what they can eat and drink,
provided it is good and healthy food?
Hon. J. P. HOWDEN: What I have to say
today will not detain the chamber many
minutes.
On the former occasion when this bill was
before the Senate I endeavoured to make
my position clear. It has not changed. Now,
as then, I am in hearty accord with the
principle of the measure.
Since the last time this bill was before the
chamber conditions have changed somewhat,
though not much. At that time, because of
rationing and scarcity, butter was hard to get.
Today, rationing bas gone and butter is available, at least to some; but generally speaking
it is as difficult to obtain as ever, and of course
margarine bas been "out on both counts."
This bill, honourable senators, deals with an
important matter, and one which comes close
to the home. Bread bas been called the staff
of life. Most hungry people, certainly those
who are very hungry or nearly starving, crave
for bread. But dry bread as a regular diet is
monotonous, and is neither as palatable nor as
sustaining as bread spread with butter. In
this form the two substances provide a most
satisfactory food, and as such they have been
associated and used for hundreds of years.
Bread in some form or by some name has been
known since earliest history; and butter, we
learn, was known, if but little used, in ancient
Greece, and was in common use in England
at the time of the Norman conquest.
Now comes the issue. Bread bas long been
the great sustaining diet of the masses, the
sine qua non of humble human existence; but
butter bas always been a highly-prized and
rather scarce article of diet. One may reasonably believe that in an earlier period butter
seldom found its way into the diet of the
under-privileged the world over. It is equally
reasonable te assume that, knowing on the one
hand the desirability of having butter and the
pleasure to be found in a butter spread for
bread, and on the other hand the difficulty of
procuring it, people's minds turned to substitutes. So we have had butterine and oleomargarine. To this day in some rural districts,
in the very places where cream is produced,
you will find people spreading their bread with
beef dripping, pork dripping, lard and other
animal fats, and shipping their cream to
market.

Very great strides have been made in the
production and perfection of butter substitutes, especially of oleomargarine; and sensing
that it would come into regular competition
with and perhaps become a serious threat to
the sale of butter, the dairy industry back
in the past prevailed upon the powers of the
day to forbid the manufacture, importation or
sale of oleomargarine in this country. Sc. here
we are with the government of Canada forbidding people to make or purchase oleomargarine,
the best and only commercial butter substitute,
when many of the very people who are so forbidden cannot afford to purchase butter and
are thereby forced to go without a spread for
their bread.
Nor is there likely to be any improvement,
for the truth is that on the basis of present-day
costs and the price of fodder, feed and labour,
butter can barely be economically produced
for the fantastic price of 70 cents a pound at
which it is now selling. The whole business is
farcical and absurd.
Honourable senators, one may state, I trust,
what one believes to be truc; and it is my
opinion that with present costs and present
prices the production of cream for butter in
this country is net economically so.und. I
believe that if the cream producers are to meet
expenses and get anything for their labour,
they must receive a bigger price for cream
than they are now getting. I would net pretend to be an authority, but I have tried to
do that very thing myself, and have found it
impossible; and if there is no prospect of
cheaper butter, what hope is there, unless this
bill is passed, of a bread spread for the very
large number of less-privileged persons?
Like the two previous speakers, I have kept
a dairy herd, although on a less extensive
scale. From my knowledge of the matter I
would repeat what bas been said so often in
this bouse, that the best price is paid for fluid
milk. For the next grade of milk, which we
call surplus milk, the price is at least $1 per
hundred pounds less than is paid for fluid milk,
which is certified contract milk. The milk
from which crean is taken off for butter is
very much lower in price than whole fluid
milk.
Reference was made by the last speaker to
the great rise in the consumption of fluid
milk during the last few years. The cry constantly is for fluid milk. All the milk produced in Canada could be used as fluid milk,
if it came from certified barns. But that is
not the case at present. The supplies for the
manufacture of butter come largely from
small barns all over the country which do not
fulfil the health regulations. We shall net do
the butter industry any harm if we permit the

APRIL 20, 1948
consumption of oleomargarine. We just do
flot produce enough creamn from the uncertified
barns in this, country to supply the amount
of butter required; and if we cannot have
sufficient butter, let us provide for those who
cannot get it something by way of a
substitute.
I arn wholly and beartily in favour of this
bill.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Lesage the debate
was adjourned.
WAR SERVICE GRANTS BILL
COMMONS AMENDMENT REFERRED
TO COMMITTEE

The Senate proceeded to consideration, of
the amendment made bv the House of Coinmons ta Bill H, an Act to amend the War
Service Grants Act, 1944.
Hon. -WISHART McL. ROBERTSON:
Honourable senators, the purpose of this bill,
which was originally introduced in the Senate,
is to provide for the abolition of the five man
board of review which bears the cases of dishonourably discharged servicemen and decides
to what extent it can recommend payments of
gratuities and re-establishment credits by
reason of mitigating circumstances. As the
work of this board is being lessened, it was
feit that the minister, whenever the volume
of cases to be heard justifies such a move,
sbould be able to transfer the remaining duties
of the board to a single reviewig officer.
In the other place the Minister of Veterans
Affairs agreed to the suggestion that, when the
present board of çreview bas been abolished,
cases remaining to be heard might be put
before a committee of at least tbree senior
officers of the departmnent instead of bei-ng
handled by a single officer speciaily employed
for this work. 'As a matter of fact, I believe
it was the honourable leader of the opposition
(Hon. Mtr. Haig) who made the original
suggestion, when the bill was being considered;
and bis idea is contained in the House of
Commons amnendment now before us.
The amendment bas two advantages. First,
the power to decide these cases will continue
to be vested in more tban one man, wbich
is desirable fromn a judicial point of view.
Secondly there will be no need to create a
special position or salary. If there is any
further information irequired in connection
with this amendmnent I sbould be pleased to
bave it sent back to tbe committee wbich
originally considered the bill. However, in
view of the explanation. given, bonourable
senators migbt agree to rny now moving concurrence in this amendment.
5853-231

Hon. Mr. LEGER: Honourable senators, I
do not know tbat tbe ameadment is aptly
worded. It ireads as follows:
la Comnmittee of at least three officere of the
Department of Veterans Affairs wbo shah] exercise and performn sucb powers, duties and fonctions in accordance with ruhes of procedure to
be made by tbe Governor in Council.
It seems to me that if no roTes of procedure
are made, the com.nittee cannot exercise any
foniction. TFhe committee is to exercise only
such powers and functions as are in accordance with the rotes of procedure to be made.
I do not know whether I arn legally right, but
I shoohd have preferred tbe words "as may be"
instead of the words "to be". Tbat formi would
be hess restrictive. I amn not opposed, bowever,
ta the principle of tbe amendnxent at a-11.
Right Hon. Mr. MACKENZIE: Honourable senators, the legal point raised by my
lonourable friend from. L'Acadie (Hon. Mr.
Leger) is well taken, but I think the construction of the language is intended to meet special cases that may arise. I bad the bonour
in other days of introducing and of having
much to do witb the formulation of the original legisiation, and I may say at once that
excellent work bas been carried out under its
provisions. Naturally the number of cases to
be beard is being greatly reduced. As I understand it, the purpose of the amendment suggested in tbe other place is to avoid giving too
mnucli power to any one individual, and to
enable a committee to carry on, as suggested
by My bonourable friend the leader of the
opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig). I tbink the
point raised by my bonourable friend from
L'Acadie can be met as cases arise.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Would you like the
amendment to go to comrnittee?
Right Hon. Mr. MACKENZIE: I do not
thînk that is neccssary.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I had intended,
if any question was raised on tbe matter, to
refer it to committce.
Hon. Mr. LEGER: I am. not insisting upon
that.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: As this question
has been raised, I would miove tbat tbe amendment be referred to the Standing Committee
on Banking and Commerce.
The motion was agreed to.

Hon. W. MeL. ROBERTSON: Honourable
sr'nators, thcse are the ameodments to which
I referred yestcrday. They have heen printed

The motion was agreed to.
EXPORT CREDITS INSURANCE BILL
'SECOND READING
ROBERTSON
MeL.
Hon. WISHART
moved the second reading of Bill 197, an Act
to am'-nd the Export Credits Insurance Act.
He said: ilonourahie senators, the purpose
of this hill is to inease the cffectiveness of
the Expert Credits Insurance Corporation hy
providing the means wiierehy, under special
condit ions, insurance contracts up to an additional $10,0 million can be undcrwrittcn hy the
corporation.
Honourable senators will recall that the
Expert Credits Insurance Act was introduced
in 1944 as a means of strengthening Canada's
post-war trade in the face of widespread
economic dislocation. One part of the Act
provided for boans to foreigo goveroments and
ageocies, and the other provided for insurance
coverage for the private exporter against
various risks of a political nature, which. ne
ordinary insurance company woeld give.
The Canadian exporter who attempts to sll
his goods in the world markets of today meets
a host of unpredictable risks which are
beyond the normal credit risks involved in all
trade.. Most countries te whieh the Canadian
exporter is trying te scîl his goods are in
serieus halance-of-payment difficulties. Many
of tbem are politically unstable. The Canadian exporter may at any time find himself
facing serieus bosses because of new restrictions
imposed hy a foreign government owing te
cancellation of import licences or fluctuations
in the value of foreign currencies. Private
insurance companies have been unwilling te
underwrite risks of this nature, and without
such coverage muchi valuable export business
would be lest.
To meet this situation the Expert Credits
insurance seheme was set up. It wa-s medelled
on a similar plan which had been in operation
On
in the United Kingdom since 1920.
December 31, 1947, the current policies of the
corporation covered an estimated expert
volume of $44,500,000, which was double the
amount covered on the same day of the
previeus year. The risks covered by these
policies were aIl uninsurable through ordinary

commercial channels. The corporation does
flot compete with private enterprise. It sets
its rates on the basis of a careful study of the
risks involved, carrying on its business in
accordance with the well-established methods
of insurance. One of its basic principles is
the distribution of its risks over as wide a
range of countries, commodities, exporters,
and contracts as possible. In this way the
prcmium rate can be kept down. In 1947,
out of 170 policies 150 were for general commodities sold on short-terma credits, and 20
were capital-goods policies of short to mediumn
termas. The corporation insured shipments to
more than seventy countries.

conditions of the last three years, and an
underwriting reserve of $584,000 has been
accumulated from the excess of incemýe over
cxpcndi ture
I have deait at some length with the operation of the Export Credits Insurance Act
because the objeet of this ameodment is to,
extend and increase its usefulness. Under the
presenit Act the corporation can take on
Iiabilitics up to a maximum of tcn times its
$10 million paid-up capital and surplus. The
proposed ameodment would permit the corporation to issue cuntracts invulving liabilities
up to anothcr $100 million, in addition to the
prescnt maximum liahility of $100 million.
Contracts issued under this new section, however, mnust fulfil two conditions: they must be
considcrcd to be in the national interest, and
they must be of a size not normally underwritten by the corporation, with its present
powers. In the past the corporation has had
to turo down several requests for policies ranging in value from $5 million to $35 million, on
the ground that to accept thera would involve
too great a concentration of risk in one particular contrapt. One example is the propoed
shipment of $35 million worth of aircraft to
the UTnited Kingdom hy Canada. A number
of suchi policies involving large amounts are
rclated to important national policies and
are dependent on balance-of-payment problems, over which neither buyer nor seller bas
any control. With Canada no longer in a position to extend credits to other n.ations on the
same sca.le -as beforeý, the amendment will
replace some of the protection that was inherent in our export credits policy.
Without this amendment, Canadian firms
woiild not bc in a position to compete for
much important expert business with flrms
in other countries whose governments do
extend suchi protection. The amendiment will

339

thus be of considerabie value to, private business in this country and to the furtherance of
important national policies. Losses on any of
these policies wiii be paid out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund, when approved by
the Governor in Council, and the details of
such policies wiIl be tabled for scrutiny by
parliament.
Honourabie senators wiil probably require
a gond deal of further information, and I amn
quite wiliing to have a reference to the appropriate committee.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: Wouid the passing
of this bill mean that we are going to give
away a lot more money?

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: That certainly is
inot the intention. The experience up to the
present tîme bas heen very favourahie.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: It looks to me as
though the bill would resuit in our giving
-away a lot more money.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: As this is an
insurance measure, I suppose it contemplates
some loases; but up to the present the cornoration has made a favourable showing.

Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: Cao the leader tell
as what lasses have been incurred up to the
present?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I am speaking
from memory, but I think the minister said in
another place that the insurance carried at
December- 31, 1947. was $44,000,000, which was
twice the figure of the year before. 0f course.
the total amount of the risks being carried
fluctuates continually. In proportion to the
whole business the losses have been negligible,

1 helieve in the neighbourbood of $18,000, and
an underwriting reserve of $584,000 bas been
set up.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: Is it intended to refer
the bill to a committee?
Hon. Mr. ROBE RTSON: Yes.
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: Can the honourable
leader tell us how long this Act has been in
force? I think it is just one year.

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: No; longer than
that.

It was passed in 1944.

Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: Arn I right in assuming tha'. tht' Act is under the direction of the
Canadian Commercial Corporation, which is
identified with the Department of Trade and
Commerce?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON- I think so.
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: Can the leader indicate what are the functions of the Canadian

Commercial Corporation, in addition to- exarr
ining and granting applications for exporu
insurance?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: That is a very
pertinent question, and I arn sorry that the
information is not at hand. There will no
doubt be a number of other questions as to
past operations; and contemplated future expansion, and these points couid be cicared up in
committee by the minister or departmental
officiais.
The motion was agreed te, and the bill was
read the second time.
REEERRED TO COMMITTEE

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON moved that the bill
be referred to the Standing Committee on
Banking and Commerce.
The motion was agreed to.

TARIFES AND

TRADE

REPORT 0F COMMITTEE

Hion. W. D. EULER presented the report of
the Standing Committee on Canýadian Trade
Relations.
The report was read by the Clerk Assistant
as follows:
1. Your committee have in obedience te the
order of referenee of 15th December, 1947, considered the subject matter of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, including the protocol of provisional application thereof, annexed
to the Final Act of the second session of the
Preparatory Committee of the United Nations
Conference on Trade and Employment held at
Geneva from April 1-0 to October 30, 1947,
together with the complementary agreements of
October 30, 1947, between Canada and the
United States of America aiid between Canada
and the United Kingdom.
2. Your committee have heard the foliowing
witnesses-.
Mr. H. B. MeKinnon, Chairman, Tariff Board.

Hon, WISHART MeL. ROBERTSON:
Honourable senators, you will perhaps recaîl
th-at so4ne time ago I întimated that at a
future date I would ask the Senate to consider a motion which would divide into two
parts the resolution in respect of the Geneva
brade agi-eements.
Honourable senato-s will
remeinher that such was the procedure in the
other bouse, and that in response Vo a question by the honourable leader of the oppositien (Hon. Mr-. Haig) I undertook to follow
the same course in this house.
I consequently give notice of these two
motions, which I shaîl move tomorrow:
That it is expedient that parli-ament do approve the general agreement on tariffs and trade,
including the protocol of provisional application
thereof, annexed te the Final Act of the second
session of the Preparatory Committee cf the
United Nations Conference on Trade and Empîcyment held at Geneva from April 10 to Octcher 30, 1947, together with the ccmplementary
agreement cf Octoher 30, 1947, between Canada
and the United States of America; that the
Senate do approve the same, subjeet te the legislation required in order to give effeet te the
provisions thereof.
That it is expedient that parliament do approve the complementary agreemnent cf October
30, 19417, between Canada nnd the United Kingdomn relating to the general agreement on tariffs
and trade; and that the Senate do ýapprove the
the samne, subject te, the hegishation required in
order to give effeet to the provisions thereof.
The point is that one motion bas to do with
the agreement between Canada and the United
States, and the other with the agreement
between Canada and the United Kingdom.

SENATE
TUE PRIME MINISTER
FELICITATIONS ON LENGTH
IN OFFICE

0F TERM

On the Orders of the Day:
Hon. WISHART MeL. ROBERTSON:
Honourable senators, I feel that members of
the Senate, particularly on this side of the
house, would like me to, make a brief reference
to the fact that today is an occasion on whieh
the Prime Minister achieves a very distinguished record in length of service.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Today he establishes an ail time record for length of service
as Prime Minister of a British self-governing
country. That is a very notable achievernent
and one deserving of high honour. I ar n ot
speaking in any sense from a party point of
view. The achievement is particularly outstanding in a country like Canada, witb its
many great and diverse interesta wbich, as
honourable senat ors know, make so heavy a
demnand upon those in public office. I arn sure
I speak on behaîf of ail honourable senators
on this sidc of the bouse and-I repeat that
1 arn not saying this in any partisan waywhen I extend to the Prime Minister our
congratulations and our sincere wishes that the
years whicb lie uhead of him may be pleasant,
happy and successful.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.

Hon. JOHN T. HAIG: As leader of His
Majesty's opposition in this bouse, I have
great pleasure in rising to support the remarks
of the governiment leader. I appreciate being
a member of the Senate at the time when Mr.
King attains the distinction, so far as bistory
shows, of baving held the office of Prime
Minister longer than any other person in the
British Empire. Whether that record bas been
exceeded outside the British Empire I do not
know.
Without in the sligbtest detracting from
what I have said, I want to add one or two
words. After felicitations were offered to the
Prime Minister last year, I gave a little
tbought to the question of lengtb of service
by public men, and I found that in Nova
Scotia, one of our democratic provinces, the
Honourable Mr. Murray held the offic'e of
Premier continuously from 1896 until 1922.

Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, bear.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I looked a littie further
and I found that the Honourable Mr. Mowat
was continuously Premier of Ontario from 1872
until 1896, wben he resigned to become a mem-

ber of the Laurier government.

During those

twenty-four years he neyer suffered a defeat.

Not wishing my own province to be outdone

by either Nova Scotia or Ontario, I naturally
turn te the province of Manitoba, where a
gentleman by the name of John Bracken held

the office of Premier continuously for twenty
years and six months without defeat. Knowing something about the opposition in that
province, I can say quite candidly that Mr.

Bracken had to wîn by any means at bis
disposal.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I arn happy to join with

the honourable members of this bouse in wisbing Mr. King ail good bealth and happiness

durinýg the remainder of bis life. It is my
understanding that he intcnds to resign early
this summer, and I would not do anything to
either encourage or discourage bim in that
intention. I join with Mr. MacNicol, who
spoke recently in the other place, in exprcssing
the hope that the Prime Minister will write
bis memoirs. Had sncb men as Sir John A.
Macdonald,
Sir Wilfrid Laurier and Sir
Robert Borden left written records of their
memoirs, they wvould have been a magnificent
contribution to the bistory of Canada.
1
hope that Mr. Mackenzie King will be spared
many years in which to write of bis experiences during bis term of office, so that tbe
historians of a hundred years hence may know
something of the thoughts and actions of the
people of this day.
Hon. CYRILLE VAILLANCOURT (Translation): Honourable senators, may I .join in
corgi'atulatiog the right honourable the Prime
Minister of this country, who bas juts estabbi-bcd an ail time record.
I endorse the wishes and congratulations
expressed by mýy colleagues, but I wish also to
tell the youtb of Canada-and I consider that
we in this Chamber are still young-that one
cao be old at twenty or young at eighty;
depending on the hope witb which we face the

future.
In view of the work which Mr. King bas
accomplished and the great services which he
bas rendered to bis country, tbougb his point
of view may not be sbared by ail, it can ho
truly said that Canada bas remained faithful
to ber ideels. Here in Canada we enjoy freedom; we are under no compulsion. We owe
this privilege to our economic system and our
basic laws; and Mr. Ring is one of those wbo
contributed most to the maintenance of those
'laws.
I remember. wben he was mucb younger
than hie is today and wben he was Deputy
Minister of Labour, the interest that he took

APRIL 21, 1948
in a Inovement which was and stili is particularly dear to me-the co-operative movement.
He understood that there was no comipulsion
in this co-operative orgainization, but, on the
contrary, the greatest freedom; that through
this movement everyone ooul develop his
initiative, his effort and his work in order to
achieve something in c-.operation with his
fellow-citizens and ail those who wished to
contribute to the greatness and prosperity of
the nation.
Mr. King has remained faithful to this ideal;
and I hope that bis example will be followed
by otherzs-an example of hard work, fair pplay
and nobility of mind.
DAIRY INDUSTRY BILL
SECOND

READING

The Senate resumed from yesterday the
adjourned debate on the motion of Hon. Mr.
Euler for the second reading of Bill B, an Act
to amend the Dairy Industry Act.
Hon. Mr. LESAGE: Yesterday I moved the
adi ournment of the debate to enable my colleague the honourable senator from Grandville
(Hon. Mr. Bouffard) to speak on the measure,
as 1 knew hie would be bere today. With
permission, I will waive my right to speak now.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: There bas been
some rnisunderstanding regarding the right of
the honourable senator to speak. I believe that
the honourable senator from Leeds (Han. Mr.
Hardy) intimated yesterday that bie had no
objection ta the honourable senator from
Grandville (Hon. Mr. Bouffard) speaking at
this time; and, with leave of the Senate, he
may speak now.
Some Hlon. 'SENATORS: Agreed.
Hon. Mr. HARDY:- I have no objections.
Hon. P. H. BOUFFARD: Honourable senators, I have listened with great attention to
the arguments presented by most of the bionourahie -senators who bave spoken in the debate
on this bill. There were a few whoma I did not
hear, because I was absent. Ail those who have
spoken deserve warma congratulations upon the
research they have made into this matter and
the able way in whicb they have presented
their respective points of view.
If one looks into the bistory of margarine,
hie finds that the product was first introduced
as food in Europe and in the United States as
long ago as the time of confederation. The
llrst 'Canadian legislation witb respect ta it
was passed, 1 believe, in 1866, when by 49
Victoria, Chapter 4, the sale and importation of
margarine in Canada was prohibited.
5853-24

343

Hon. Mr. EULER: Is that not 1886?
Hon. Mr. BOUFFARD: I beg your pardon,
it is 1886. This prohibitory law remainéd in
force untîl 1917, when the importation,
manufacture and sale of margarine was again
permaitted. In 1923, five years afterwards. the
importation of margarine was again prohibited;
a.nd in 1924, one year later, the sale and
manufacture of margarine in Canada were
also .probibited; and this statute has remained
in force since that time. That is ta say, the
prohibition of importation, manufacture and
sale of margarine in Canada bas lasted for a
period of over sixty years. Taking for granted
that margarine was not at ail times as good
a food as it is today, I nevertheless conclude
that if it bas been prohibited for so long a
period it is because, for some reason, the dairy
industry had to be protected in this respect.
Today 350,000 farms in this country are
participating in the dairy industry. In 1900,
approximately 36,000,000 pounds of butter
were manufactured in Canada. Today the
annual production, in 1200 factories is
approximately 400 million pounds, and the
value of the industry to this country is almost
$400 million per year, or -about as much as
that of the pulp and paper industry, more than
that of the mining industry, and much more
than that of the fisbing industry. It is evident,
therefore, that butter is one of aur most
important manufactures, and it is produced
ail over the country in a very large number of
factories.
Butter accounts for 8 billion pounds of milk,
and its manufacture provides our farmers with
a steady market for the large surplus of milk
wbich they produce in the summer tirne. In
the variaus stages of manufacture and transportation, the industry provides employment
ta many persans, and it distributes hundreds
of thousands of dollars in wages. It is also
of great assistance ta the hog-raising business,
and gives aur farmers a large measure of
financial stability. It is my impression, and
that af many others, that butter production
is one of the most important industries whicb
bas developed in Canada, and one fully
deserving encouragement and stabilization.
Coming froin a city, but baving lived for
a long time in the country, my mind was open
ta conviction tbat the bill now before the
bouse sbould be adopted. To my liberal way
of thinking the ban on the importation of margarine is wrang. But tbougb I do not like
customs duties or excise taxes, I bold that, in
view of the protection we have always given
ta practically ail Canadian industries, we

SENATE
should flot pass legisiation which wiil leave one
of the greatest of thema without a cent of protection.
The most strikîng arguments presented last
year and this year by the honourable senator
fromn Waterloo (Hon. Mr. Euler) are that the
right of our citizens toi choose the product
they will buy, and the right to purchase it at
the lowest possible price, are part of the
freedomn to which ail citizens are entitled;
and that therefore they should be free to, take
advantage of a product which would cost thema
less than butter.
Well, honourable senators, if this is the
freedom, to which our citizens are entitled, the
policies of ail governments which have been in
power since confederation have been far from
attaining that goal. Because of prohibitory
measures, of customs duties and of excise
taxes, it bas been impossible for our citizens as
consumers to purchase the produets they
wanted at the cheapest possible price. Some
imports bave been wholly barred; as regards
others, conditions of purchase have been
rendered so oncrous as to be equivalent to. a
total prohibitien. In the whole field of necessitic,, otir c-itizen., have bad to purchase local
products at prices which were in excess of the
prie of similar w'oducts manufactured outside
Canada. Such freedom. would, as a matter of
fact, mean free trade, and would be in direct
opposition to the policy which should be
followed by a young- country that is endeavouring to develop its own natural resources, and is
rnviting industrial development in its midst.
It would be absolutely opposed to the policy
that has been followed in order to attract
industrial growth and invite investment capital
to this country. I do flot believe that freedom consists in allowing free trade in Canada;
nor do I believe that the liberty of the citizen
is linked to the free importation into or manufacture in Canada of any product which will
ruin and destroy one of our most important
industries. I do not believe that freedom. conmists in legislation that would endanger the
industrial development of Canada.
If freedom. means that every Canadian
should be able to purchase in Canada aIl he
needs or wants at the lowest possible price,
why not abolish customs duties and excise
taxes? From. the beginning Canada, as a
young country, bas carried out the policy of
encouraging industrial development. It bas
attracted induistries and encouiraged industrial growth under a systemn of duties and
taxes. It bas given investors in industry
adequate protection until such time as their
products can compete with similar products

manufactured elsewhe:re. In fairness we owe
that protection to such investments and industries.
Some hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. MT. BOUFFARD: I know that some
of my good friends are thinking that I arn
rather on the Conservative side.
Sorne Hon. SENATORS: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. BOUFFARD: But I certainly
wouid not want to be quotedHon. Mr. HAIlO: You will be quoted.
Hon. Mr. BOUFFARD: Yes, but wait a
mainute. I certainly would not want to be
quoted as saying that the systern of customs
duties is only adequate to the necessities of
the industries protected.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: What does that
mean?
Hon. Mr. BOUFFARD: 1 believe that in
many cases the protection is too great, and
far from being just adequate.
In many cases it is more than suffliient to
adequately protect sorne of our industries. I
stili feel, however, that the policy of protection
by tariffs and customs duties and excise taxes,
such as bas been maintained for more than a
century in Canada, remains at the present
time the correct policy, provided that it is
prope'rly controlled.
The comamodities wbich are manufactured
or produced in Canada are practically all
protected by duties and taxes. For example,
the automobile industry is not only protected
by heavy cusbomns duties and excise taxes, but
it is protected by a prohibition against the
importation of used cars and trucks from the
United States. Sucb a prohibition bas existed
since 1931, being estabiished by a Conservative
regime and rnaintained by a Libeýral oneeven while my honourable friend from. Water100 (Hon. Mr. Euler) was a minister in the
government.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Heýar, hear.
Hýon. Mr. EULER: May I ask the honourable senator a question? Is he in favour of
protection within Canada against a Canadian
manufacturer or competitor? That is what he
is asking for.
Hon. Mr. BOUFFA RD: I arn going to
answer my honourable friend in a very short
tine. An explanation
is coming.
Hon. Mr. EULER: It is coming a littie
later?
Hon. Mr. BOUFFARD: Yes. The protection
given to the automobile industry is such that

APRIL 21, 1948
purchasers of motor vehicles in Canada have
to pay about twice as much for them as they
would if there was no protection at all.
Hon. M-r. EULER: But automobiles are
made in Canada.
Hon. Mr. BOUFFARD: If freedom means
that Canadians are to be enabled to purchase
what they need or want at the lowest possible
price, the principle should apply to automobiles, trucks and buses as well as to substitutes
for butter. It may be said that all automobiles,
trucks and buses manufactured and sold in
Canada are luxury goods. I do not believe
for a moment that they are. These vehicles
are essential to our great transport systems,
and to all men who use them in their various
businesses in order to earn a living. If we
agree that it is justifiable to protect the automoble industry, should we not agree that it is
just as proper to protect the important dairy
industry?
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. BOUFFARD: Honourable senators, let us refer to the textile and clothing
industry. No one will doubt that clothing is
an essential commodity which every Canadian
citizen needs. The clothing and textile industry
has always been heavily protected by the
imposition of duties and taxes. Nobody will
argue that if the duties were removed the
price of clothing and textiles would not greatly
decrease. I am told that bed sheets of a certain quality cost $18 in Canada as compared
with $8 in the United States. Who will deny
that sheets are an essential commodity?
Honourable senators, so long as our farmers
have to pay for the duty on commodities
manufactured by other industries-commodities
the farmers need-then I say that they are
entitled to proper and adequate protection for
their own important industry.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. BOUFFARD: Canada has protected the fruit growers in the past, and has
also decided to protect the tobacco industry.
In fact, I do not think there is any Canadian
industry which has not been protected. Someone asks about the lumber industry. It too
is heavily protected.
Nobody even thinks or dreams of free trade
legislation in Canada. If legislation were passed
abolishing most of the customs duties imposed
upon essential commodities, these commodities
could be sold here at lower prices, but the
majority of our people would be in a state of
calamity by reason of losing the jobs they are
at present enjoying. Investors would lose the
greater part of the capital that they have
invested, and thousands of workmen would be
5853-24J

345

on the street. Our great working class would
be the first to absolutely oppose such a policy,
which would throw Canada into disaster and
ruin. If the workers of Canada are secure in
the jobs they hold, their security in many cases
is the consequence of duties and taxes imposed
upon goods for the purpose of protecting the
industries in which the workers are employed.
I am sure they would not even think of opposing adequate and proper protection for the
dairy industry, which they need and which I
am sure they respect.
Hon. Mr. EULER: But they want margarie.
Hon. Mr. BOUFFARD: I am coming to that
in a short time.
Hon. Mr. EULER: You have said that twice.
Hon. Mr. BOUFFARD: They are not the
only ones who want things that cannot be got.
I would like to be able to buy an automobile
and clothing at American prices, and so would
the farmers.
Hon. Mr. EULER: But these things can be
bought in Canada.
Hon. Mr. BOUFFARD: Nobody can manufacture margarine in Canada, though, without
importing the necessary ingredients.
Hon. Mr. EULER: Nonsense.
Hon. Mr. BOUFFARD: I am sure that
departmental officials are correct in stating
that it is not possible at present to manufacture
margarine unless we import most of the
necessary materials.
Hon. Mr. EULER: There is no authority
whatever for that statement.
Hon. Mr. BOUFFARD: There is authority,
and as a matter of fact many people are
coming to that point of view. We have not
got the fats and oils necessary for the manufacture of margarine, and if we do import
fats and oils in order to manufacture margarine,
our allocation of fats and oils for other purposes will be decreased. The Food Advisory
Council has allocated a quota of fats and oils
to Canada. and that quota is only sufficient
for about half our requirements.
Hon. Mr. EULER: We have heard that
story a thousand times.
Hon. Mr. BOUFFARD: I was saying that
I am sure the workers of Canada would not
think of opposing adequate and proper protection for the dairy industry, which they need
and respect. They would not think of refusing the farmers the protection to which they
are entitled, any more than the farmers would
deny workers the protection they require for

SENATE

their jobs. Ail c!a.scs of ouir population need
one another. No ci~,espcciaiiy the working
class. wooid oppose adeqoate protection for
the farmers. The workers know that because of
the protection given to our industries farmers
pay higher prices for products manufactured in
Canada. Our protection policy sbouid apply
to ail classes. So long as farmers have to pay
taxes and customs duties on the goods they
buy, they are entitled to protection on the
3omodiiesthat tbey themselves produce.
Somne Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. BOUFFARD: Somebody may say
that margarine is a produet which ceuid be
manufactured with materials entirely produced
in Canada. It xviii be a long time before that
is sO.

Hon. Mr. EULER: Why?
Hon. Mr. BOUFFARD: As I have already
remarked, cils and fats -are stili under the
control of the Food Advisory Council, wbichi
aliocates a quota to Canada. Our country can
one-haif
the
secure oniy approximately
quaatity of Cils and fats needed here for
shcrtening and various other foods, the canning industry and scap. Any excess in the
production of fats and ails in Canada xvouid
mean a decrease in or imnport allocation, and
it xviii be somne years before we can use the
fats and oils necessary for the manufacture of
margarine. I say tbat util the timîe cubes
wbcn Canada can use fats and euls in sufficient
quantity for the production cf margarine, it
weuld bc a crime te open or market te a
forcign produet or te a prcduct made from
fats and cils from eutside, without due and
adequate protection of or butter that is
manufactured entirely in Canada.
Somebody may say that our butter seils at
a high price. No one, bowever, lias suggested
that it is seiiing at a price higher tban is
neccssary for proper maintenance cf the
industry. The cost cf feed for cattie lias

a necessary
sequence, butter ells at a bigbier figure, but,
as I bave just said, it is not higbher than it

Hon. Mr. QUINN: Why can we net get

Hon. Mr. BOUFFARD: If co looks into
the prices cf other commodities, socb as
automobiles, textiles. ciothing. shees. weol.
linon, tobacco. aicobeol, lomber, paper, and se
on, bie finds that they are ail mucb bigber tban

Tbe campaign that bias been under way

paganda. It does flot go to the root of the
problem. Would it be ressonable, for the
sake of overcoming a butter scarcity Iasting
une month-when the average yearly consumption per person is twenty-eight poundsto bring in during the other eleven months of
the yeae a foreign. product -in carnpetition with
the highly developed dairy indus ry?
1 cannot be convinced of the wisdo'm of
passing legisiation to permit the irnport of
margarine without proper import duties being
imposed upon the ingredients ta be used ini
its mianufacture. My honouraible friend from
Waterloo (Hon. Mr. Euler) believes that we
can manufacture margarine in -Canada from
products entirely produced in this country.
I would flot want ta say that my friend is
wrong, but I amn told that he is.
Hon. Mr. EULER: And you do not choose
to believe me?
Han. Mr. BOUFFARD: My fr'iend may be
right, and lie inay be wrong, but I believe that
before legislation of this kind is enacted we
must be ûonvinced that the ingredients that
go into the eommodity can be entirely produced in Canada.
Hon. Mr. EULER: I do not like ta interýrupt, but may I ask a question? Would my
fr'iend believe it if he were told by the
Researchi Council of Canada?
Hon. Mýr. BOUFFARD: I would certainly
believe the Research -Courneil of Canada. But
I repeat that 'before we deal with the question
of margarine there should lie an imposition
of taxes and duties on the ingredients that axe
ta be imported into Canada, In that wa.v I
would lie sure that margarine would flot be
sold in Canada in competition with butter,
unless the proper duties and taxes bad been
paid. I would have no objection ta margarine being rnanufactured in Canada from
materials produced -in Canada. Witbout such
an assurance, however, I am flot satisfied that
legislation should be passed permitting the
sale of margarine. What I object ta is that
the farmers of Canada, who have budit up an
industry almost comparaible to the pulp and
paper industry-which is protected-should
have reason 'to feel that their product is flot
Properly protected by tariffs upon the materjais that would go into the mianufa~cture of
margarine.
If the legisiation 'befo'e, us assured the
farme
of the protection I ask, I would have
no objection to, the manufacture of margarine in Canada. But this house cannot dea]
with the present bil in such a manner. We
cannot impose taxes and duties. For that
Teason

I suggest ta my honourable friend from

Waterloo (Hon. Mr. Euler)-and I arn suce
this proposition wdll meet with the approval
of other honourable senators--that we should
wait until the governmient deals with the mat-.
ter di a proper manner by imposing taxes and
duties upon the materials ta be used in the
manufacture of margarine. That is the only
way we can assure the farmers that butter wilI
not be sold in competition with a commodity
manufactured from foreiga produets. Clo'thmng
hought in Canada casts a good deal more by
reason af taxation on the materiuls imported.
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: In view of my
friend's attitude tawaxds the economnic
development of industry in Canada, may I
ýask if lie would approve of an early adoption
of 'the Geneva agreements on tariffs and
trade?
Hon. Mr. BOUFFARD: I would approve
of their adoption as quickly as possible, but
I point out that there is nothing in the
Geneva agreements which prevents the government from impoeing duties on imported
fats and oils for the manufacture of margarine.
Hon. Mr. EULER: That is quite true.
Hon. Mr. BOUFFARD: The Geneva agreements have declared that no country may ban
margarine, but governments are not prohibited
from placing duties on the ingredients.
Hon. Mr. EULER: That is not in accordance with the statement given 40 this chamber
yesterday by the leader of the government.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON:
I think my
honourable friend should qualify lis remark.
He knows what I said.
Hon. Mr. EULER: Certainly, I know what
was saîd.
Hon. Mr. BOUFFARD: I do not know
what was said yesterday, but the Department of
Trade and Commerce gave me the impression
that there was nothing ini the Geneva agreements which would prevent the government
from imposing duties on margarine and margarine products imported unto Canada.
Hon. Mr. EULER: That is quite true.
Hon. Mr. BOUFFARD: At the autset of
my remarks I said that I was opposed ta the
ban on oleomargarine, but before the ban is
repealed I want ta see proper taxes and dutiesf
levied.
Since the start of the recent war, the
farmers of Canada have flot been allowed ta
sell their products ta the best markets. Lately
they have lost part of the subsidies on coarse
grains, and they cannot yet enter the United
States market with their cattle, their milk or

SENATE

their cream. I feel that so long as arrangements and agreements are not effected to give
our farmers the chance to sell their products
on the markets of the world, we owe them a
duty to protect them against any foreign competitive product.
I do not at all favour arguments which
range consumers against farmers or working
classes against farmers. I do not believe in
the division of our Canadian citizens into
classes: our policy should be to consider the
interests of the Canadian people as a whole.
Let us have more publicity and more education, so that every class will understand that
it is the policy of the government to cater for
the needs and welfare of all. How many workmen know the amount of protection necessary
to maintain and develop the industries in
which they work? How many know the tremendous extent of duties which everyone in
Canada has to pay for the maintenance of
How many consumers
those industries?
realize what the unrestricted importation of
margarine would mean to the farmers? How
many workmen, if they knew these things,
would wish to deny the dairy industry the protection it needs?
Hon. Mr. HARDY: Three millions.
Hon. Mr. BOUFFARD: Three millions who
do not know?
Hon. Mr. HARDY: Three million workers.
Hon. Mr. BOUFFARD: Yes, three million
workmen need that protection.
Hon. Mr. HARDY: No.
Hon. Mr. BOUFFARD: I believe that of
those three million workmenHon. Mr. HARDY: It is the three million
workmen who have to pay for the ban on
margarine.
Hon. Mr. BOUFFARD: Why should 500,000
farmers have to pay for the maintenance of
three million workmen? And of those three
million, I am sure that two and a half million
or more, if they knew the facts of the question
we are dealing with, would agree that the
farmer is as much entitled to protection as the
workman is entitled to it in the job he holds.
Hon. Mr. HARDY: That is just a guess on
your part.
Hon. Mr. BOUFFARD: We should not
oppose one class to the other. Every class
should be considered; and I am sure that if the
farmers and the workmen were better educated
concerning this matter, the present bill would
be, not before this house, but in the other one,
where duties could be imposed to give the
farmers as much protection as is afforded to

the workmen-a protection to which, I think,
everyone is entitled. As recently as last week
I was talking in my office with a workman who
bas been employed for thirty-five years in the
textile industry; he had no grudge against the
farmers, but he wanted margarine because he
thought he could not afford to buy butter at
70 cents a pound. And be was rightHon. Mr. EULER: Sure be was.
Hon. Mr. BOUFFARD: He was right from
his point of view, because he did not know
anything about the situation. But when we
had talked about the degree of protection
received by the textile industry, which has
permitted him to work and has enabled
him to hold his job and keep a home
for thirty-five years, he admitted that the
farmers also were entitled to a little protection,
pending the time when the markets of the
world are oprned to them for the sale of their
cattle, their butter, their milk and their cream.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: And their wheat.
Hon. Mr. BOUFFARD: And their wheat.
This man, who had been opposed to the ban
on margarine, and who did not think any duty
should be imposed on the materials necessary
to produce it if they came from outside
Canada, left me with the definite impression
that my line of thinking was the right one.
Hon. Mr. NICOL: He is intelligent.
Hon. Mr. BOUFFARD: Exactly. Canada's
population is one, and the policy we should
maintain should be such as all would agree
with and all would favour; not one policy for
the farmers and another for the working men,
but a policy which would foster the industrial
development of Canada without depressing
the dairy industry into a lower bracket than
any other industry in Canada.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: No discrimination.
Hon. Mr. BOUFFARD: Some people tell
us that margarine would not compete tith
butter; but no one will convince me that if a
pound of margarine could be bought at 50 cents
when a pound of butter cost 70 cents,
two out of three women would not buy
margarine. After a five year trial period why
did the Government of Canada change its
policy and again prohibit the manufacture,
sale or importation of margarine? And why
bas that policy persisted for over fifty years?
It was in force for over thirty years before
1917; and no serious complaints were heard,
I would say, until two or three years ago.
Hon. Mr. HOWARD: And it was the policy
of different governments.

APRIL 21, 1948
Hon. Mr. BOUFFARD: Yes. If it was a
good policy at a time when less than 40,000,000
pounds of butter per year was produced, why
should we change it when the manufacture of
butter has risen to 400 million pounds a year,
in 1,200 Canadian plants? I do not understand why this policy should be changed,
unless it be because of the slight scarcity of
su'pply which has occurred during the last
month, and which if investigated will be found
due, I believe, to defects of storage and distribution that could readily be corrected without the introduction of a competitive product.
Hon. Mr. HOWDEN: Will the honourable
senator permit me a question? Does he think
there is any connection between the present
scarcity of butter and the price of butter at
this time?
Hon. Mr. BOUFFARD: I do not think so.
There are countries where there is no scarcity
of butter, but where the present price is as
high as or higher than that in Canada.
Hon. Mr. HOWDEN: I suggest to the
honourable gentleman that the price of butter
in this country is not high enough, and that
the farmers are not getting enough for it.
Hon. Mr. BOUFFARD: That is another
reason for not placing it in competition with
another product. If you had competition, you
would get less.
Hon. Mr. EULER: That is a conclusive
argument, I must say!
Hon. Mr. NICOL: I suggest that the bill
be withdrawn.
Hon. Mr. BOUFFARD: I do not want to
prolong the discussion. I just wish to make
myself well understood.
First, I am opposed to prohibitions, but I
think this particular prohibition should not
be repealed unless there is some assurance
that foreign margarine, if admitted, will not
compete vith butter. In the second place, I
am not opposed to the production of margarine in Canada if the ingredients going into
it are produced here, not imported from a
foreign country. In this respect, I am sure,
the views of my honourable friend from
Waterloo are the same as my own. He does
not want to bring in products from outside
which would be competitive with Canadian
farm products.
Hon. Mr. EULER: We are not far apart.
Hon. Mr. BOUFFARD: No. Why not let
the other house deal with this matter-I do
not mean through the Sinclair bill, because that
cannot settle the situation any more than the
legislation before us. Let the government deal

with this situation in the proper place, where
they can impose taxes on materials brought
into Canada for the purpose of manufacturing margarine or import duties on margarine
itself. If my honourable friend would agree
to that, I am sure everyone would be satisfied and would vote for this bill.
Hon. Mr. EULER: I do not wish to interrupt my honourable friend, but in all seriousness I should like to point out that he says he
is quite in favour of the unrestricted manufacture of margarine within Canada. Well, we
are agreed on that. He is also in favour of
the importation of margarine if a proper
tariff is placed against it.
Hon. Mr. HORNER: A prohibitive tariff.
Hon. Mr. EULER: That is my question.
Does the honourable senator mean a prohibitive tariff or an actual working arrangement?
Hon. Mr. BOUFFARD: I refer to a tariff
which would mean that margarine imported
into Canada would not compete with butter
any more than automobiles or textiles from
the United States compete with automobiles
and textiles manufactured in Canada. That is
what I mean. I think we should give the
farmers the same protection for their industry
as we give to those interested in the automobile
and textile industries in Canada.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. BOUFFARD: If it means prohibition, it means prohibition. I have taken a
great deal of your timeHon. Mr. LACASSE: Before my honourable
friend sits down may I ask him if he is aware
that only a few weeks ago the municipal
council of his home city passed a unanimous
resolution demanding the removal of the ban
on margarine?
Hon. Mr. BOUFFARD: The only answer I
can make to my honourable friend (Hon. Mr.
Lacasse) is that they did not have the opportunity of learning of the difficulties that exist
in this matter. They are not familiar with the
situation. They have not been properly educated. Aside from that, however, the council
of the city of Quebec can have its own view
and I can have mine. If the members of that
body had been properly informed of the situation they would not insist upon such a resolution. I am sure that it is only through education and knowledge that the two great classes
of our country, the farmers and the workmen,
can be brought together. If we owe a duty
to the workmen we owe a similar duty to the
farmers.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.

SENATE

Hon. J. J. DONNELLY: Honourable senators, this is the third tirne that this bill bais
been before the house. On two previous occasions I expressed rny views on the matter. I
did flot intend to speak on the subi ect today,
but after listening to some of the remarks
made by my honourable friend from Grandville (Hon. Mr. Bouffard), I should like to
make a fewv brief comments.
I notice that the bonourable gentleman is
particularly anxious to, look aftcr the interests
of the dairy farmers. I do not think any
person who is supporting this bill bas any
desire to injure the dairy farmers. As far as
I arn concerned, 1 arn only aoxious to see the
poor man witb a low income placed in a position to purchase food wbicb is necessary for
the welfare of bis littie childrcn. We know
f bat most men witb large families have small
rncomes, and it is to help these people that
I support this bill.
As I have said, my bonourable friend
appears to bc' particularly concerned about the
farmers. I do not like to be personal, but I
may say tbat, althougb my principal business
bas been lumbering, I have had an extensive
experience in farrning and in livestock. I live
in a section of Ontario that depends on the
agricultural industry as rnucb as any other
part of this province does. I bave twice voted
for this hill and have argued frcely with my
farmer friends about the matter, and I have
yet to hear one of tbern object to the position
I take.
The, dairy industry is only one part of the
large and important cattle industry. At the
present tirne the beef raisers of Canada are
deprived of great, profit in order that our
rich as well as our poor may buy meat at a
price lower than tbey would have to pay if
the shipment of cattle to the United States
were permitted. If the beef producers make
that sacrifierp for the good of the country,
there is no reason why the dairy producers
sbould not make a similar one. However, I
really du nut tlîink tlîat under this bill tlîey
would be making any sacrifice.
I should like to make a comment about
Canadian beef producers. There is a section
in Ontario, around the counties of Bruce and
Middlesex, wbere the people are deeply interested in the beef industry. Tbey are almost
as near to the Buffalo market as tbey are to
tbe Toronto market. I have flot tbe paper
witb me, but in tbe market news in yesterday's Globe and Mail 1 read tbat 800-pound
prime steers were selling in Buffalo last
Monday for 28 cents a pound, wbile similar
steers were selling in Toronto for 16 cents, a
difference of 12 cents a pound. A man shipping
a carload of 800-pound prime steers to Toronto

-hie would get about 25 bead in a car-would
receive about $3,200 less freigbt and expenses.
In Buffalo, for the saine carload bie would get
$5,600. In other words, by sbipping his cattle
to Buffalo bie would get 52,400 more than bie
would get in Toronto-and he would be paid
in American dollars, wbicb at present we need
very badly. That is an example what tbe beef
producer is suffering in order tbat the people
of this country may buy beef. I arn merely
trying to point out that the beef men are contributing mucb more tban there is any danger
of the dairymen baving to contribute.
Hon. Mr. HORNER: Two wrongs do not
make a rigbt, so wby rob tbe dairyrnen?
Hon. Mr. DONNELLY: I did not suggest
robbing tbem. I tbink it would bie for the
general good of tbe country. I arn not saying
it is right, butHon. Mr. HORNER: It is far from wbat
you would expect fromn a government that
boasts of free trade.
Hon. Mr. DONNELLY: I live in a part of
the country wbere there is a good deal oe
dairying, and I do not tbink tbere is going to
be any increase in the production of butter.
The farmers bave found it almost impossible
to get belp, and many of the farms have only
old people living on tbem. In biring belp tbe
farmers cannot compete with tbe wages being
paid for labour in tbe cities, and yet there is
mucb work to be done on tbese dairy farms.
The dairy industry is a seven-day-a-week job
-fourteen mornings and evenings. I believe
that farmers will abandon the dairy industry
and go into the beef cattie industry, because
it does not require nearly as much labour as
dairying, nor does it require the saine class
of buildings. You can put a bundred bead of
beef cattle into a barn, and tbey can run loose
in pens as tbey do at tbe market. You do not
have to look after the barn every day as you
do in the dairy industry.
Honourable senators, as I said befo>re, it was
not my intention to speak on this matter but
wben I beard my cloquent friend from Grandville express bis fear of what was going to
bappen to the dairy industry of this country,
I tbought I sbould say a word or two.

Hon. W. RUPERT DAVIES: HonouTable
senators, I bave supported th4 proposed
amendment to the Dai.ry Act on two occasions,
and I amn supporting it again. I will briefly
state my reasons. In the first place, in coinmon witb a good many other Liberals and
many Progressive Conservatives, I do not;
like monopolies, dictatorsbips or controls. This
ban on margarine is notbing but a monopoly.
Hon.

Mr.

prohibition?

H-ORNER:

How do you like

APRIL 21, 1948
Hon. Mr. DAVIES: Prohibition of what?
Hon. MT. HORNER: Of the sale of cattie
to the United States.
Hon. Mr. DAVIES: I thought you meant
of liquor-and 1 arn against that.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. DAVIES: I arn supporting this
bill because I believe government should be
for the greatest good of the greatest number.
There is a tremendous demand for margarine
in Canada today, as I th'ink I shall ha able
to prove. The honourable senator froan Grandville (Hon. Mr. Bouffard), who delivered not
only an eloquent speech but the best protectionist speech that I have heard in many a
long day,Somne Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. DAVIES: -aid that we had had
a ban on margarine prattically since 1886, and
he asked why we should take away that protection fro-m dairy farmers now. I would
remid him 'that margarine has been sold in
Great Britain continuously for the last sixty
years, and that the dairfy farmers of that
country were neyer as prosperous as at present.
Hon. Mr. HORNER: Are they not subsidized by their government?
Hon. Mr. HOWARD: In every way.
Hon. MT. DAVIES: I do not think so.
Ho0n. MT. HAIG: The dairy farmers in England are subsidized.
Hon. Mîr. DAVIES: To a certain extent.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: To the extent of millions.
Hon. Mr. DAVIES: The sale of margarine
hWs neyer prevented the dairy farxners in that
country from making 'money out of butter.
I want to say a few words about margarine
itself. The Ministier of Agriculture saidI forget wh.&re the speech was delivered-that
margarine would liot be good for the health
of the Oanadian people. I should like to
place on the record part of an editoirial from
The Canadian Medical Association Journal of
August, 1947. The editorial is rather long,
so I shaîl rend only the firet and the last two
paragraphs:
The annual effort in parliament to permit of
the sale of margarine in Canada has met 'with
its annuýal defeat.
That was wsditten aSter the defeat of the
bill here last session.
The political aspect of the question need flot
ha dwelt on here, beyond expressing the hope
that persistence in the -adývocacy of ite use rn.ay
have its reward. In the meanwhile the dietary
or nutritive value of margarine cannot be made
too clear.

A typical margarine today, as made in the
United States, consista of 80 per cent refined
vegetable ojîs, together with 16-5 per cent pasteurized non-fat milk for flavour, plus smail
amounts of glycerin deri-vative to prevent spattering in frying, vegetable lecithin to prevent
burning and stîcking to the pan, sometimes
benzoate of soda as a preservative, saIt and
vitamin A concentrate up to a minimum of 9,000
U.S.P. units par pound; some brands go as high
as 15,000 units per pound.
From the economic and nutritional aspects
good margarine is superiar to butter.
I wanted to have that on the record.
Hon. Mr. LEGER: Who is the author of
that editorial?
Hon. Mr. HOWDEN: It is an editorial in
The Canadian Medical Association Journal,
so it is authentic.
Hon. Mr. LEGER: But who expressed that
opinion?
Hon. Mr. DAVIES: I do not know. 1 suppose it was the editor. Would my honourable
friend not accept the opinion of the editor of
The Canadian Medical Association Journal?
Hon. Mr. LEGER: I would not accept the
opinion expressed in any editorial unless I
knew who the editor was.
Hon. Mr. DAVIES: I do not know who
the editors of The Canadian Medical Association Journal are,-but I take it for granted that
they are able men.
The honourable senator from Grandville
advocated continued protection for the dairy
industry, and assumed that by lifting the ban
on margarine we would do a lot of harmn to
dairy farmers. I do not believe that. I have
an article here from the Kingston WhigSLandard-and I can tell my honourable friend
fro,m L'Acadie (Hon. Mr. Leger) who wrote
that. It was written by one of the reporters
of that paper, who I presumne was sent out to
learn why people were telephoning in to complain that they were able to get only haîf a
pound of butter at a time.
Hon. Mr. LACASSE: Was that in Kingston?
Hon. Mr. DAVIES: That was in Kingston,
the Limestone City. Among the persons interviewed was an official of a local dairy, who
said:
By its price policy the government eut down
butter production eat the start of the war and
has neyer qut. Farmere can't get as much out
of selling their milk for butter and naturally
the milk goas into other channels. There will
be a decided shortage until apring.
Hon. Mr. HOWDEN: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. DAVIES: An official of another
dlairy said:
Farmers get less for butter than for any other
dairy product. The milk therefore goes into

SENATE

other channels-cheese, condensed milk, market
milk. Until the public is willing to pay the
farmer a price for butter equitable with other
dairy products, there will be shortages of butter
at certain times of the year.
If there is a shortage of butter and we can
consume more than the producers are able to
put on the market, surely the manufacture and
sale of margarine would not do much harm
to the dairy industry.
One remark made by the honourable gentleman from Grandville (Hon. Mr. Bouffard),
with which I enti-rely agree, was that we
should think of all the people. I say we
should think not only of the 350,000 dairy
farmers that there are said to be in this
country, but of the thousands and thousands
of men who carry dinner pails to work every
day and have not enough butter to put on
their bread.
Some Hon. SENATORS:

Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. DAVIES: Furthermore, we should
think of the little children who, on coming
home from school, ask-at least I know my
grandchildren do-for a piece of bread and
butter, which they cannot get because (here
is not enough butter to go around. If a
wholesome substitute like margarine could be
made available there would not be so much
complaint about the shortage of butter.
I wish to point out that not all the dairy
farmers of this country are opposed to margarine. I have here two letters written to the
Pelcrborough Examiner. One is signed "One
Satisfied Farmer's Wife", and the other
"Cream Shipper". I have been in the newspaper business a long time, and I know that
sometimues in writing letters to papers people
use noms de plume that are not correct. So
I wrote to the ed'itor of the Examiner and said,
"I know you have the same policy as we have
in not giving out the names of persons who
send Jetters to the editor under assumed
names, but I should be glad to know if the
letter signed 'One Satisfied Farmer's WVife',
which appeared on March 27, was in fact
from a farmer's wife, and if the one signed
'Cream Shipper' which appeared on Saturday,
April 3, was really from a shipper." In his
reply he assured me that both noms de plume
were accurate, and that the cream shipper was
one of the largest shippers in the district.
What the farmer's wife said in her letter was
this:
May I reply to a recent letter from "Farmer"?
Everyone is weary of such complaints and,
as a farmer's wife, I say it is all bunk. With
butterfat at seventy-three cents, anyone who is
losing money producing it had better- go into
other business. "Farmer" makes an imposing
case for his work. It sounds like a lot, but any
good milker should milk a cow in eight minutes

flat.
Other chores are in proportion.
If
"Farmer" bas to churn an hour or longer, there
is something wrong with his method. Twenty
minutes should be the limit for good cream and
a good product.
"Farmer" also skirts the fact that his cow
produces a calf each year, and what about the
skim milk he bas left? It is a most valuable
feed for that calf and hogs.
I'll admit that for the purchaser butter is
high in price. Yet we have our side too. For
years, and only a short time ago, we sold butter
for twenty-five cents and then we really lost
money. I use "lost" in the sense that we were
unable to keep our place in repair and up to
efficiency. Repairs and replacements could not
be financed, but now, for the first tine in a
decade, we are getting on our feet. Surely
there should be no objection to that. Any fair
person must agree that we should have enough
margin of profit to replace what is expended in
the production of any commodity.
As for margarine, personally I am in favour
of it. If it is a good food, it should be available
for use. It hasn't depressed the price of butter
too much in the States. Anyway, their butter
sells at a higher price than ours.
I do not wish to weary honourable senators
by reading more letters, but I have another
one from a cream shipper which reads as
follows:
Sir: You are to be congratulated on. the stand
you editorially take re the butter situation. It
does seem strange why a Liberal government
should enact various dictatorial laws and think
they should prove popular.
Good cannot corne out of ereating a butter
monopoly, banning its rival margarine. Witness
the butter shortage. Poorer classes of people
deprived of a substitute. Good cannot corne out
of eviction control. Witness good types of
people unable to obtain accommodation. People
afraid to rent their rooms. All such laws have
no place in a democracy.
I do not know whether the dairies are making too high a profit or not. Let there be an
investigation. Considering the cost of production farmers' returns are not bigh.
I cannot understand the mentality of any
farmer who would want the government to create
a monopoly for him to protect his interests.
He would probably be one of the first to howl
if the government created a monopoly for any
group of implement manufacturers.
As a cream shipper, I naturally hope that
butter will maintain its popularity over all
substitutes. I feel it will too. I hate the word
monopoly and do not want my interests protected that way.
In Ontario-and I speak only for that
province-I would say that 90 per cent of the
press .is in favour of the removal of the ban
on oleomargarine. Led by the Toronto Globe
and Mail and the Ottawa Citizen, most of the
papers are strongly in favour of it. While I
do not agree with everything the Globe prints,
I do read it regularly. I particularly agree
with the little quotation from Junius appearing
at the top of the mast-head:
The subject who is truly loyal to the Chief
Magistrate will neither advise nor submit to
arbitrary measures.

APRIL 21, 1948
The ban against oleomargarine is definitely
a monopoly and an arbitrary measure.
Another paper published in the province of
Ontario, and which enjoys a good reputation,
is Saturday Night. It is a newspaper containing comments of a high literary quality, and
is edited by perhaps one of the most distinguished journal-ists in this country, Mr.
B. K. Sandwell. On April 3 last, ,Saturday
Night expressed its views strongly on the question of oleomargarine, as follows:
The Senate is now thouglit to be likely to
pass an oleomnargarine bill this session.
Mr. Sandwell should be here this afternoon;
lie might change bis mind.
Should it do so it wi]l throw lipon the House
of Commons the whole burden of maintaining
an absolute prohibitive ban on a cheap article of
food whick is accepted in ýalmost every other
country of the world as nutritious, tasty and
economical.
The opponents of oleoniargarine are not defending a naturýal and generally recognized
riglit. They are not preventing something which
would be a menace te the health or economic
welfare of the nation. They are asserting a

dlaim to a species of protection which is enjoyed

by practical]y no other industry, and a dlaim
which they can enforce only by denying to two

see no reason wliy we sbould not bave it in

Canada at tbe present time. I do not believe
for a moment tbat it will interfere with the
activities of the dairy farmer. It is my opinion
that bie will continue to seli aIl the butter lie

produces at good prices. If lie does not sel
butter profitably, lie will probably seli fluid
milk, as lie is doing today. I cannot possibly
understand wby, when we are sbort of butter,
and milk and cream are being sold for other
purposes, we sbould deprive our working people
of a proper spread for their bread. It la my
opinion tbat even if margarine were available
there would stili be a good sale for butter in
Canada. I know tbat in Kingston today there
is a limited supply, and it is rationed. I
repeat, I do not like monopolies or controls,

and 1 arn against a prohibition whicli prevents
people from. buying tbe food tbey wisb to buy.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: I sbould like to ask my
bonourable friend if the newspapers have ever

taken a poli to see wlietber the people are in
favour of removing the taxes on motor cars?
Hon. Mr. DAVIES: In reply to the honourable senator I can only say tbat newspapers

be interfered with merely to afford protection
to a particular indust-ry.
My friend on my right (Hon. Mr. Nicol)
will agree with me when I say that the press
is not'always rigbt. However, it sometimes
bits tbe nail on the head. There is a lady's
magazine called the Chatelaine published in
Toronto by the Maclean-Hunter Publishing
Company, which. recently took a poil of its
readers on the question of margarine. This
dominion-w-ide survey sbowed that 80 per cent
of tbe readers of tbis magazine were in favour
of tbe removai of the ban on oleomargarine.
But stronger proof of public opinion than that
is sliown by the figures ini tbe Iatest Gallup poil,
taken by tbe Institte of Public Opinion.

oleomargarine are as follows:

NORTH FRASER HARBOUR
COMMISSIONERS BILL
SECOND READING

Hon.
WISHART MaL. ROBERTSON
moved the second reading of Bill E-7, an Act
to amend the Northi Fraser Harbour Commissioners Act.

He said: This bill, bonourable senators will
observe if tbey look at it, is a very simple
one. Its purpose is to make a change in
the wording of tbe Act which is neaessitated

by the union of the municipalities of South
Vancouver and Point Grey with the city of
Vancouver. At the time the Act was originally
drafted

these

were

separate

municipalities.

Since 1929, liowever, they bave formed part
of the city of Vancouver;

and the obsolete

wording led, and leads, to a certain confusion
whicli it is now proposed to rectify. In each
case tbe words "city of Vancouver" are suli-

stituted for tbe names of the municipalities of
Point Grey and Southi Vancouver wbere tbey
appear in the Act.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the second tume.

SENATE
The Hon. the SPEAKER: When shall the
bill be read the third time?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: With permission,

NATIONAL PARKS BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. WISHART McL. ROBERTSON
moved second reading of Bill G-7, an Act to
amend the National Parks Act.
He said: Honourable senators, as far as the
number of pages is concerned this is quite a
lengthy bill, but I do not think it necessary
to make any extended explanation of it.
The purpose of the bill is to consolidate into
one Act the description of all the national
parks of Canada. These are set out in the
schedule appended to the bill. Previously the
National Parks Act contained a detailed
description of the boundaries of only five of
the national parks, and descriptions of other
parks, together with changes made from time
to time in their boundaries, were contained in
a large number of separate orders in council.
The present bill merely consolidates this
information. No new changes in the boundaries of the national parks are introduced.
The bill also contains provisions whereby
the regulations made under the Act come into
force after a single publication in the Canada
Gazette, and whereby various obsolete Acts

and parts of Acts relating to the national parks
are repealed.
I doubt if there is any additional information that I can usefully give; but it has
occurred to me that some honourable senators
would like information as to specific boundaries or some other matters in which they are
interested, and since the Standing Committee
on Natural Resources is sitting tomorrow, this
bill might be referred to it. I have an open
mind on the matter.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Honourable members, I
have read the bill, but not the schedules,
because they would not mean anything to me.
I think the purpose of the bill is commendable.
I should like to have it go to committee so
that the departmental official concerned with
its administration could give us an unqualified
assurance that no changes are being made in
the boundaries of the parks.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the second time.
REFERRED TO COMMITTEE

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON moved that the
bill be referred to the Standing Committee on
Natural Resources.
The motion was agreed to.

BILL

Hon. WISHART
McL. ROBERTSON
moved the second reading of Bill H-7, an Act to
amend the Prisons and Reformatories Act.
Hie said: Honourable senators, I have asked
the honourable senator froma Vancouver South
(Hon. Mr. Farris) to explain this bill.
Hon. J. W. de B. FARRIS: Honourable
senators, this bill is short, but involves an
important principle. It provides that British
Columbia courts may impose an indeterminate
sentence on youths between the ages of 16 and

SENATE

23. The sentence is to be flot less than three
months, and flot more than two years less one
day. As honourable senators wel] understand,
the addition of the words "less one day" means
that the offender wilI not be sent to a penitentiary, as he would be if sentenced to twu
years or more.
Under our present law these boys, if convicted
and flot sent to a penitentiary, are sent to our
cemmon lails, and no more unlit places for
themn can possibly be imagined. 1 suppose
that conditions in the jails of every province
are similar to those that prevail in the larger
commen jails of British Columbia. They are
frequented by the riff-raff of criminals who do
flot even attain the distinction of having
reached the penitentiary, and wbo have the
worst possible influence on youthful prisoners.
The bill empowers the courts of British
Columbia to commit young maie offenders to
New Haven. That is rlot the city of that
name in the state of Connecticut, but an
institution in British Columbia, somewhere
in the vicinity of the cities of Vancouver and
New Westminster.
The bill defines New
Haven as "the institution establisbed in
British Columbia for the reclamation of juvenile offenders". Young men who are sent there
may be assured of reasonable removal from the
contamination of the common jails.
The Attorney General of British Columbia,
who bas taken a great deal of interest in boywelfare and been instrumental in the establishment and maintenance of a Borstal school at
Vancouver, bas recommended this institution
and bas approved of the bill in its present
form.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Honourable senators, I do
not knowv wby the province of British Columbia bad te be picked out for special treatment.
1 know somctbing of the common jails in
Manitoba. They may net be a.ny worse, but I
arn sure they are flot any better than those in
British Columbia. I mnust -say, though, that.
the provincial laul in Manitoba is quite up to
date and-if this description inay be applied
to a jail is a very fine institution.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: My critici-m of the
jails was bamcd net on tbeir physical condition so much as on the kind of people that
young effenders meet there.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I agree with yen.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: My honourable friend
lias commented that the bill applies only to
British Columbia. Up to the present time
legislation in -uch form bas applied exclusive]y
to Ontario, the only province which has had
an institut.ion of the kind referred to here. Now
that Britis~h Columbia has a similar institution,

it lias requested this measure. My bonourable
friend mighit perbaps suggest to the Attorney
General of Manitoba an -extension of the legislation to that province.
Hon. Mr. LEGER: May I ask the honourable gentleman from Vancouver South (Hon.
Mr. Farris) wby the bill applies only to
offenders who are given a sentence of at least
three montbs?
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: 1 arn unable to give a
definite answer to that. I assume it bas been
considered that persons sent te the institution
would net benefit from the training given
there if remaining at the place for less than
three months.
Hon. Mr. LEGER: I arn afraid -this may
have the effeet of causing some sentences te
be longer than they etherwise might have been.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: The bill provides for
the appointment of a board of parole, and it
could release prisoners at any time on parole.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: Do I understand
thiat there is sirnilar legislation for Ontario in
force now?
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: Yes. If the bill is passed,
British Columbia will be the second province
te which sncb a provision applies.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: It may in time be
extended te other provinces, if they ask that
this be dune?
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: That is right.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: 1t is along the right, lne.
The motion was agreed te, and the bill was
read the second time.
RAILWAY
SECOND

BILL

READING

Hon.
WISHART
McL. ROBERTSON
rnoved the second reading of Bill 201, an Act
te amend the Railway Act.
He said: Honourable senaters, the main purpose of this bill is te increase from $200,000 te
$500,000 the ameunt te be appropriated fer
each of the next nine years for the Railway
Grade Crossing Fund.
Since 1909 it bas been the practice for parlisment te vote for the Grade Crossing Fund a
snrn of $200,000 a year for ten-year periods. Ia
1939 this procedure was discontinued, and ne
money was provided for the fnnd during the
war years. Last year parliarnent passed a bill
providing for an appropriatin
oif $200,000
annually for the next ten years. Since then
the Board ef Transport Cemmissioners. which

APRIL 22, 1948
recommends payments out of the fund for the
elimination of level crossings, has had before it
a large number of applications, and bas recommended that the appropriation for the fund
should be increased to 850,000 a year for the
remainder of the ten-year period.
It should be noted that these appropriations
represent the contribution of the federal government toward the work of eiiminsting
dangerous level crossings of highway and rail
lines. This work is a joint responsibility of the
federal, provincial and municipal governments
and the railways, and the financial burden is
shared by them.
As of February 6, 1948, the total in the fund
was $206,523. The Board of Transport Commissioners hears applications from initerested
parties for the removal of particular level
crossings. It examines each project, consults
the municipal authorities, and determines the
share of the cost to be borne by the Grade
Crossin-g Fund, the municipality, and the railroad. The federal government's share out of
the Grade Crossing Fund in, the cost of any
project is limited by the Railway Act to 40
per cent of the total. The remaining 60 per
cent of the cost is made up by contributions
from the railroad and the municipal or provincial government. The board's poiicy is to
deai with specific applications on their merits.
In view of the very many possible projects of
this type, such a policy is considered to be the

359

most practicaî approach to the problem. By
increasing the appropriation to $500,000 a year,
the federal government will be in a position to
make contributions to a large number of
important grade separation projects.
The remaining clauses of the bill relate to
-telegraph and telephone lines laid underground,
giving the board the same powers in this
respect in ail municipalities as it bas at present
in towns and cities.
If honourable senators wouid like to question officiais on this bill, it seems to me that it
should be referred to the Committee on Transport and Communications for further consideration.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the second time.

EMERGENCY GOLD MINING
ASSISTANCE BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. WISHART MeL. ROBERTSON
moved the second reading of Bill 7, an Act
respecting Emergen-cy Payments to assist in
meeting increased Cost of Production of Gold.
He said: Honourable senators, I have asked
the honourable senator from Cariboo (Hon.
Mr. Turgeon) to explain this bill.
Hon. J. G. TURGEON: Honourable senators, without question there are members of
this bouse who know more about gold than
I do, but for many years I have been interested in the gold mining industry. During
my period of service in the House of Commons I represented the district of Cariboo,
which is known for its great gold production.
Certain honourable senators who were held in
high esteem, and who bave since passed
away, once spoke of tbe value of the district
of Cariboo to, the gold mining industry. As

SENATE

these bonourable senators have said, the
Cariboo gold rush did something for Canada
that would not have been done for rnany
rnany years if gold bad net been discovered in
that region.
Before flnishing I shaîl say corne other words
concerning gold, but cf the very sfart I wisb
te compliment the Sonate, and cspecially those
cenators w-ho in 1946 were members of the
Standing Committee on Natural Reseurcos,
whicb was aufherized te study the condition
of our goneral rnining industry and te make

chairman of that cemrnittee, and thougb 1
do net cee him prosent at the moment 1 wish
te tender te him rny respectful congratulations
upon tbe good work done by him and bis
cornînittee. I took the opportunity today of
reading corne of the evidence presentcd te
that cornrittee, especially that given by the
British Columbia and Yukon Chamber of
Mines, by Mr. Sidney Norman, ef Toronto,

also read the committee's report, and one
tbing that struck me as I read if was this
statement:
If will be seen, theretore, that rising cests,
tegether wifh the fixed price for gold, are closing the gap hetween the cosf ot producing gold
cnd the price realized fa the extent that the
margin et profit is mcking if more and more unprofitable te mine low grade ores.
The committee made further statements,
but at the moment I arn reading that one only,
as I wish te pacs on te the proposed legiclatien and te record cerne statements approving
it. It w-ill ho ceen that in general thoce statemonts et approval by persons highily interested ai-e baced upon or certainly directly
related te the thought. wbich prompted the
report et the Sonate committee. I have here
a statement made by Mrs. Viola MacMillan,
prosident ef the Prospecters and Devolopers
Association, at a meeting in Toronto hast
March:
This proposed legislation is specifically designed te keep high-cosf producers, and the
communities w-bich fhey support, alive.

their genoral consideration et al! conditions
affecting gold by saving this:
Bill 7 was designed te reduce the effecfs of
thaf squeeze.

They are talking here of a squeeze that was
mentioned in the Natural Resources Committee's report of' the Senate, a squeeze brought
about by the clash between rapidly increasing
costs of production and a fixed price for gold
and a restricted rnarket. They say:
Bill 7 w-as designed to reduce the effeets of
that squeeze. Its effect is to assist higb-cost
operato-rs te remain in operation. Marginal
mines and new producers will beniefit. But the
chief significance ef Bill 7 is that the Canadiani
government has thereby recognized the economitimportance of the gold mining industry and the
need of keeping it in operation.
I Iust w-cnt te link that up with a staternent
made on this bill by the Minister ef Finance
ia the House of Commons hast December:
The government bas therefore revised the form
of its assistance and I wish no-% te give an outlineofe our propos-al w-hich the government hopes
will contrihute in corne degree te the recenstitutien ef our doplcted gold reserves.
There bas been a lot of discussion about this
bill, corne people claiming that more should
be donc and corne claiming that nothing w-batever should be dono. That latter dlaim makes
ne appeal te thoce of us who wisli te take
gold from the mines. I have here a clipping
frorn the Northern Viner, stating that the sua
is beginning te chine on the gold mining
in(lustry. Tbey were looking forward te an
iml)rovemcnt in the general international
acceptante of gold and a higher price for the
mectal; but refcrring te this particular proposed
legisiation, that paper said:
Mluch as one may deplere the acceptance ef
relief, the goveronent aid plait keeps the marginal mines in the pictu-re until the price of
geld is raisod.
As bonourable cenators know, the plan first
suggested te the people ef Canada by Mr.
Abbott, Minister ef Finance, w-ns revi-sed te,
the ferra ef the bill w-hicli w-e now have before
us. He stated in another place that the revisien w-as made because ef objections raised by
the International Monetary Fund, and was
endorced lator by the National Advisory Council uf the United States govornment; and hoe
placed on Hansard of the other bouse statements w-bich, with the consent of benourable
senators, 1 sbeuld like te place on the Senate
Hensard.
(Sec appeedix at end of tedey's report.)
Before geing any further on this bill I should
like te say a w-ord about certain legiclation
passed in 1936, which w-as of positive and direct
benofit te the mining industry. A moment or se
ago w-bea I said that there were members ef the
Senate w-ho know more about gold than I do,
I w-as thinking of what was done at that timte,
and that coee nators wvero then mem-bers of
the goverrmnt wbich initiated action that

APRIL 26, 1948
did more than any other individual action by
parliament to bring about a decided improvement in the gold rnining industry. I see here
the honourable senator from Churchill <Hon.
Mr. Crerar), who in those days was Minister
of the Interior and in charge of mines and
natural resources generally. I also see the
Riglit Honourable Senator frorn Vancouver
(Right Hon. Mr. Mackenzie), who then was a
minister representing the great gold producing
country of Britishi Columbia; and the honourable senator fromn Waterloo (Hon. Mr. Euler),
who at that time held the portfolio of Trade
and Commerce.
During general discussions on this bill many
things have been said in approval of it, and
naturally some statemnents disapproving of it
have been, made. There has been a great deal
of discus~sion about the relationship of Canadian
currency to the currency of the United States.
It has been said by some that the troubles of
the gold mining industry in Canada commenced on July 5, 1946, when the then
Minister of Finance, Mr. Ilsley, announced to
parliament that Canadian currency was being
placed on a par with United States currency.
The troubles of the gold mining industry
started long before that. Before parity of
exchange between Canada and the United
States was brought about the Senate committee reported that at that timne prospects
for the gold mining industry indicated at least
a cloudy sky. It is, however, true that parity
with the United States did do damage to the
gold mining industry.
Honourable senators will remember that
when the Honourable Mr. Ilsley, then Minister
of Finance, was proposing to raise the value
of Canadian currency he gave as his reasons,
and those of the cabinet, that the proposal
was based upon the fact that without parity
in our currencies conditions taking place in
the United States were bound to bring about
inflation and a higher cast of living to the
people of Canada. In making that statement
the honourable minister frankly admitted
that the one industry that would suifer hy the
proposed legislation was the gold mining
industry. He feit, however, that it would
benefit, by the general improvement in conditions for the Canadian people, and that it
would be better with parity than without it.
One very often hears statements about the
futility of taking gold from. one hole in
Canada and depositing it in another hale at
Fort Knox. I do neot want to tire honaurable
senators by speaking at length tonight, but I
wish to place on record some strong views
which I hold with respect to gold, and which
1 know will be shared by every honourable
senator.

First, I would draw the attention of the
bouse ta a book called America's Raie in the
World Economy, written by the noted ecanamist Alvin H. Hansen. There are Canadian
economists who could be quoted. I arn
ehoosing Mr. Hansen because he is not a
Canadian, but a citizen of the United States,
because lie is held in higli esteem, and because
lie is not in favour of a return to the gold
standard. Referring to the futility of taking
gold from one piece of ground and planting
it in another, the author says that any sucli
assumption is based upon false premises.
While lie makes the positive declarationwith which I do not agree-that we will not
again have a gold standard because of its
rigidity, lie does say that not for many years,
if ever, will gold ]ose its value and its international significance as far as currency is concerned. He points out the truth that if we
took away ahi reference to gohd there would
be no International Monetary Fund. The
terms of this fund disagree with the basis
for the proposed subsidy of 87 annaunced by
Mr. Abbott hast November; but by reading the
articles of agreement of the International
Monetary Fund honourable senators will
find that without gold the fund could not
carry on. It is provided that a percentage
af each nation's quota is ta be pledged in
gold. For instance, of a quota of $300 million
to the fund Canada must contribute some
$75,000,000 in gold.
One of the outstanding functions of the
International Monetary Fund is the resteration of currency equilibrium, but this condition is not being attained very rapidly. One
gathers from even a cursory glance at the
troubles of the countries af eastern, central
and western Europe that the underlying cause
is the lack of acceptable curreney held by the
governments of those countries.
There is a great deai of talk today about
communism and the inroads of communism.
I arn thinking now largely in terma of international relationships as aifected by gold. I
have in my hand an elightening book on Kari
Marx, written by one who was sympathetie
towards him. He extals the things that in bis
opinion Marx did ta educate the world. He
states that a 'large percentage af the people
have been tumned against capitalismn and
towarde the doctrines ai communistn as
preached by Kari Marx. The authar deals 'with
that feature af the histery of Europe which
brouglit about the revolution in France, in
February and Mardi af 1848.
An Hon. MEMBER: What is the autbor'a
namne?

SENATE

Hon. Mr. TURGEON: The author it Otto
Rùble. 1 shall read a short extract fromn his
book.
Following the French Revolution of February
and March, 1848, Kari Marx was preparing and
watching hopefully for a further revolution
which was expected to break out in France and
to spread to Germany.
In March, 1850. Marx penned an address to
the Communist League which was centred at
London. This address descrjbed the political
situation and specified -wihat in Marx's opinion
ought to be the behaviour of the working class
in the accepted revolution. 1 quotc from. Marx's
address:
It may be
The revolution is imminent.
brouglit about by an independent rising of the
an attack on the
French proletariat, or by
part of the Holy Alliance directed against the
revolutionary Babel.
The author continues:
But Marx was taken aback when the news of
great discoveries of gold in California reacbed
Europe. In the second issue of the "Revue" hie
alluded to the enormous importance of this discovery, and to the beginning of a period of
flourishing trade. 'By the suramer of 185H, had
corne the crushing conviction that the prospect
of a revolution in Europe had been indefinitely
In the closing number of the

"Revue", Marx wrote:
"There can be no talk of a real revolution
in such a time as this, when general prosperity
prevails, when the productive forces of bourgeois
Society are flourishing as luxuriously as is possible within the framework of bourgeois conditions."
The author goes on:
California gold had favoured European capital. This was a fýact wbich mnade all manifestos
inoperative. ail proclamations vain, ail revolutioaary hiopes futile.
On September 15, 18,50, the Cornrunist League
Split up.

That brings to mind what we knew years
ago, but which 1 fear we aýllowed ourselves to
forget, that a large numnber of American maining
engineers, responding to offers by Generalissimo Stalin, went to Russia in the thirties.
Looking back over at the history of those
times, we observe that a split in the Russian
dictatorship occurred: there was a break
between Stalin and Trotsky and their respective adherents. It may neyer have occurred
to us that that dispute related to gold production, but history records that that fight took
place because Stalin desired to establish a
national socialism which, if extended beyond
the borders of Russia, would move eastward
into Asia. H1e was thinking of Japan, looking
towards the control of Sin Kiang, of Outer and
Inner Mongolia and Manchuria, while Trotsky
and bois associates were aiming at the policy
which is now being put into effect, of expanding and dominating Eastern Europe and
advancing into Central Europe,

Stalin won; and many scores of minîng
engineers were attracted from Amnerica and
employed for years in Soviet Russia, particularly in the vast areas east and south of the
Ural Mountains, in the region of Lake Baikal,
and through southern and eastern Siberia,
down to the southern borders of Siberia as far
as the two Mongolias, China and Manchuria.
For at least ten years the development of gold
production was stimulated by incentives.
Those who were willing to participate in the
search for gold were given those rewards which
appeal to man's acquisitive instinct-and 1 use
that term in its highest and best sense.
When the Soviets first gained power, following the Russian revolution, influenced perhaps
by the beating which the theories of Marx
had taken through the discovery of gold in
California, they did flot favour the use of gold,
and would flot permit it to be mined. Among
those consigned to forced labour were many
Siberian prospectors. But when, after this
division in the ranks of the party, Stalin
determined to search for gold, he recalled these
prospectors, instituted a drive for the discovery
and production of gold, and requited those
who took part in the industry on a basis more
favourable than that enjoyed by any other
workers or labourers in the Soviet Union. We
do flot know how much gold Russia is producing today.
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: Is she stili pursuing
the same policy?
Hon. Mr. TURGEON: Well, these American
engineers have been sent home. It is quite
possible that they have instru-eted native
engineers, and that Russia now possesses techmicians as qualified to carry on the work as
were the Amnericans whom they have succeeded.
But, as we know, there is a closed curtain, and
wbile reports of one kind and another are
circulated-for instance, just recently the
United Nations issued an estimate that the
world's total gold production last year was $900
million, of wbich Russia is supposed to have
produced $100 maillion-they are purely con.ieeture; nobody knows.
Hon. Mr. HORNER: Russia will not give
out any information.
Hon. Mr. TURGEON: No.
I come now to another question which has
been raised-an open market. I suggested a
whilc ago, and I arn returning in a moment
to the sanie point, that this bill goes to the
heart of the gold problern by trying to save
the industry from the consequences of the
clash which arises from the rapidly increasing
cost of production as .against a flxed price for
the product which is available for sale. That

APRIL 26, 1948
is a condition which cannot'be remedied except
by extraordinary legisiation sucb as this bill.
So I repeat, the bill goes to the heart of the
problem; and, as one who wants gold to, be
used internationally, as one who hopes that
it will again become the standard of currency
for the whole world, 1 now put upon the
record an expression of appreciatian of the
action taken t.brough this measure by the
Minister of Finance, by his colleagues in the
Cabinet, and by his departmnental advisers and
assistants.
The legisiation now proposed will do a
wealth of good to the mining industry and,
through it, to the people of Canada. It provides for financial aid to high-cost operations.
It bas application only to the type of mine
which is generally termed in the industry a
straigbt gold mine. To benefit by the provisions of this bill, the gold production of a
mine must be at least 70 per cent of the total
output. In the second place, the aid is continued for tbree years, namely, in the calendar
years 1948, 1949 and 1950. Thirdly, the assistance is conditional upon the cost of production per ounce being greater than $18. If the
cost is greater than $18, the amount of production of each mine ini aach one of those three
calendar years is compared to, the production
mn the so-called base yaar, which is the year
ended June 30, 1947, and financial aid is given
to that portion of the production in tbe designated year wbich is over and above two-tbirds
of, the production in the base year.
The
financial aid given is 50 per cent of the cost of
production over and aboya $18 per ounce,
provided that in no case must the financial aid
given by tbe government be greater than $16
per ounce. In the case of new mines tbe aid
is given on the total production of the first
year, and for the next two years it is given on
two-t.hirdg of the total production for the first
year. These are the general provisions of this
bill.
Having in mmnd the whole condition of the
gold mining industry and tbe study and report
made by the Senate committee two years ago,
I say that iii the provisions for increased
depletion allowances and the exemption from.
taxation for tbree years of new mines coming
into production, the government has gone a
very long way towards meeting the wishes
embodied in that report of -the Senate committee which laboured so effectively u.nder
the chairmansbip of the honourable sanator
from South Bruce <Hon. Mr. Donnelly).
Honourable senators, I have only one suggestion to make, and although it does not deal
with this bill it relates to, gold. Bacause of
the clash between tbe cost of production and

366

the fixed price of 35 dollars an ounce for gold
it is becoming more and more difficuit for prospective developments to secure the necessary
funds for exploration. I would suggest, purely
for the considaration of competent authorities,
that at some future time the government further
consider the Senate's recommandation that
tbe depletion allowance, whicb is increased
from 33J per cent to 40 per cent be încreased
to 50 per cent, and that the depletion allowance
permitted to shareholders, which is now set
at 20 par cent, be increased to 50 per cent.
As I bave said, this suggestion bas no relation
to the bill immediately befora us; but I want
parliament to appeal to the acquisitive instincts
of men and woman, so tbat tbey will go out
and searcb for something valuable, aspecially
gold. They will do this if proper incentive is
provided, but the cost of production today is
Sa high that, with a fixed price, thera is
apparently not mucb to be acquired.
Honourable senators, money is expended in
ordar to provide an incentiva to American
tourists to coma to Canada and spend their
United States dollars here. Wbat would be
the difference if we axpended monay to
inecase gold production and securad United
States dollars in that way? We should remember that about 18 par cent of the total cost of
gold production goes to labour outsida of the
mines. and to purchase products, commodities,
and services of otbar industries. We should
remember that the community developmant of
the northarn parts of British Columbia,
Alberta, Manitoba, Ontario and Quebec was
almost entiraly brougbt about by tbe searcb
for and the production of gold. We should
also remember that whan the second world
war was forced upon us, the training tbat our
bush pilots receivad while flying to and from
gold prospects proved invaluable ta aur air
force. Tbat is an illustration of wbat the gold
mines have meant in a domestie way, altogetber apart from the gold valua. When the
people of the world finally get together and
agrae that war is no longer necessary, tbey
will decide upon an acceptable currency that
can be used in ana country as frealy as in
another. Wben that is done, gold will play an
aven greatar and more important part in world
affairs that evar bafore.
Honourable senators, I urge the accaptance
of the motion proposad by the honourabla
leader af the govarument (Han. Mr. Robertson) that this bill be naw givan second
raading.
Hon. ARISTIDE BLAIS: Hanourable
senators, I beg to be excusad for rising ta
speak ta you in English wben I am well awara
of my inability to speak it correctly. I know

SENATE

your extreme kindness, and I arn sure you will
forgive me if I make mistakes or scorch your
cars with faulty pronunciation.
Gold is on the order of the day; in fact it
is always the order of the day almost everywhere. 1 have always been fascinated by that
metal. 1 do not know why, but in spite of all
my attention and courtship it bias always
eluded me. Speaking in ternis of chemistry, I
suppose our two bodies repel each other; or
perhaps my profession hias been toc jealous
of the time I have spent in that direction. But
I hold no grudge. I realize that in my humble
way 1 have hcelped the production of gold in
Canada by purchasing sharcs galore-shares
which are stili lying dormant in an old cupboard at home.
I wish te congratulate my honourable
friend frnrn (arihoo (Hon. Mr. Turgeon) on
the able way in which hie hias presented this bill
calling for emergency payments to assist in
meeting increased costs of production in gold
mining. I take great pleasure in supporting
this mensure, although I realize that what is
heing donc by the goverament falîs fac short
cf meeting exigencies of the hour, especially as
they ccnccrn our gold mines of Alberta, and
Yellowknife in the Northwest Territories, an
arca which I have the bonour of represcnting
in this chamber.
In 1946 I was one cf a small group of
senators who had the privilege cf visiting the
mining ccntres cf nerthccn Ontario and Quehec. This visit certainly xvas a revelation to
me. I hiad ne idea that it cost se much money
and required such hardship, courage and perseverance te dcvelop a mine and hring it into
production. What I saw in Hollinger, Mcmntyre, Lake Shore, Noranda, O'Brien and Kirkland Lake opened my cyes, as I arn sure it
did those of my colleagues.
Everywxhere wc went we wcre received with
great consideration and treated like kings.
Each proccss in the mining industry was
demonstratcd te us hy company experts. We
were even invited tu go down 3,000 feet into
the entrails of the earth te, inspeet the different connccting galleries and te sec the actual
mining taking place. It was a most instructive
experience, but it confused me because I had
cxpcctcd te sec a real vein cf pure gold runming throiîgh the rock and shining in my eyes.
Instead, the gold was se finely integrated in
the rock that it was hard]y noticeable
de vi.su, and yet we were told that gold was
present in paying quantities. Ccming up te
the surface we wcre shcwn ail the special precautions taken by the cempany te preteet the
miners against any hazard or accident, and
aIse the ncw means cf combating any incidence of silicosis. We marvelled at thc beau-

tiful recreation rooms and the vast spertrng
grounds provided by the company te kecp the
miners in good health and spirits. The food
was excellent and a frcsh cleanlincss was
cvcrywhcrc apparent. Wc came back greatly
impressed by what wc had seen, and felt grateful for the wondcrful reception given te us by
the distinguished managers cf these great
mines, whio competed te make our visit most
enjoyable and mest profitable.
What a terrible gamble it is te open a mine,

splendid prospects. There is always an inconnu,

knewledgc, courage and tenacity te undertake
such an enterprise.
Honourable senaters, you are a-Il aware that
gold bias been feund and mincd in many of our
provinces, especially Ontario, Quebcc, British
Columbia, Manitoba and Saskatchewan. But
there is one province, or rather a tcrritery
adjacent te our province cf Alberta, wherc gold
discovery bias been spectacular in these later
years on acceunt cf its richncss and cf its
quantity, although at the present time our
mîners and prospecters are working at a great
disadvantage in cemparison with Ontario and
Qîîcbec miners, who are privilcged to have their
rnîning centres se close te big cities and se well
served hy railway facilities and hus comnmunications.
In the iNorthwcst Territories, which wve are
accustemned te consider as an extension te our
province of Alberta-so. much are they dependcnt upon Edmonton for all their needs-things
arc different. There are ne agricultural lands
mîxed with our mining centres of the north.
There is ne agricultural market in their vicinity.
Everytbing, whethcr machinery, cquipment or
food, is sent from Edmonton by plane or by
truck in the wintcr as far as the northwest ed
cf the Great Slave lake, or by boat in the
summner season, xwhich is very short. Se you
can well imagine hcw expensive it is te mine
in these conditions. That is the reason why I
rejce se much at the hclp which is being
givcn by our government at such an opportune
time.
The prespec tors cf our northcrn country are
hardy people and flot easily discouraged. If the
prospects are ged thcy stick te the ground te
the finish, in spite cf the rigour cf the wintcr or
any other bardship.
But the district of Yellowknife is net exclusively known for its gold. It is also fameus for
the discovery at Ross Lake of tantalurn and
columbiumn, which are among the rare and
valued minerals ef the earth. One of the most
interesting of recent developments bias been the
establishmtent cf a tantalum refinery in Edmon-

APRIL 26, 1948
ton. It bas been estirnated that the Ross Lake
mines will yield 100 tons of minerai each day.
This makes one ton of concentrate, whicli
could be flown to Edmonton by air and, processed at -the Edmonton refinery. Gold from
Yellowknife's famous mines-the Canadian
Smelting Comnpany, Giant and- Negus-is flown
through Edmonton. Millions of dollars' worth
of equiprnent and food are flown. down north.
With thia encouraging example before them,
our people are looking: for greater developments in the mineral-rich north. Aside from a
great interest in gold, tliey have their minds on
rumoured iron, deposits and. other metais that
the Precambrian Shield normally yields. Their
greatest expectations are reserved, however, for
the radium uranium ore deposits on Great Bear
lake. In an atomie age they see exceptional
possibilities from their proxim-ity to one of the
world!s largest deposits.
It is a cumulation of those possibilities-their own, and those of the north-that stir
the imagination of the Alberta people. The
sobering factors of transportation and markets,
however, are problems that hamper quick
deveiopments. For instance, Canada imports
mudh of her needed coal froin the United
States, while Alberta lias hardly scratched the
surface of lier reserves. The long freiglit haul
ta eaqtern markets is the problem. Freiglit
rates are the limiting factor on many Alberta
industrial developments. I shahl give you an
illustration. In 1910 I was leaving for the
Old Country, to take a postgraduate course.
Being a shareholder in the Fort McKay
Asphait Company, I was given a sampie of
asphait to take to McGill University at
Montreal for analysis. At Montreal I met
a friend who was very familiar with asphaît,
as he was a contractor who provided the city
witli asphait to put on its streets. I asked
him to corne with me ta McGill University to
see what the report on my sampie was, and
when we gat there we were told that it was
one of the richest grades known; it was said
to be better than what was imported from
Trinidad, and almost as good as the rock
asphalt from the Old Country. My friend was
8o enthusiastic that lie said to me, "Let us
go ta tlie Canadian Pacific Raiiway and find
out how mucli it wiil cost to bring that asphalt
from Edmonton to Montreal." In lis enthusiasm lie overlooked the cost from Fort
McMurray to Edmonton. At the railway
office we were informed tliat tlie freiglit wouid
be $20 a ton. Well, Trinidad asphaît was
lieing delivered at Montreal for $15 or $16
a ton, so there was no possibility of meeting
tliat campetition.
Yet industriai development is bound ta
come, in spite of sucli obstacles. In the field
5853--25

367

of chemnical engineering we see the brightest
promise for tlie fuit realisation of our industrial future. Coal is the basic raw materiai
for liundreds of products, sueli as plasties,
vanilins, anilins, carbolic, flavouring saccharine,
perfumes and drugs.
In the Fisher Tropseli process Alberta sees
a market for lier tremendous reserves of
naturai gas. This procesa makes possible the
turning of natural gas into liquid fuels.
Natural gas is aIso a raw material for tlie
manufacture of acetylene, alcoliol, plastics,
carbon products and ammonia.
Our saît depasits also offer vast chemnicai
sources for medicinal and pliarmaceutical products, for soaps, paints and fertilizers. Not
long ago when drilling for ail was being done
in the Vermilion area, tlie drillera went down
through about 500 feet of saît, and, not finding
any oil, they decided to mine sait. I may
say that in the regions of Waterways and
MeMurray there are numbers of seama about
200 feet deep, extending over a large surface.
Witli so much wealth so readily available and
untouehed, aur optimistic dreams are bound
ta came true.
Befare tlie first war I met in Edmonton
a distinguished gealogist by the name of
Engel, wlio was sent by a New York syndicate
ta explore the coal depasits and otlier minerais
in the nortliern part of that cauntry. When lie
returned after a cauple of montbs investigation,
I asked him wliat lie thought of tlie Nortli. Be
replied that tliere were indications of great
weaith sprtad aîl over the nortli country, but
that aur greatest asset was oil and coal. My
geologiat friend aiso stated that tlie large
minerai deposits could only be exploited by a
large company, such as Sheli Oit, whicli cauld
wait as long as fity years for its profits.
A supply of coal means energy for heavy
industries. Tlie deposits of coal in Alberta
have scarcely been touched. Do honourabie
senators know tliat aur coat fields contain
considerabiy mare coal of a superior quaiity
than the cambined filds of Germany and
Poland?
May I refer briefly ta the contents of a book
on Canada which I read years ago? Tlie
autliar was a German who assumed the name
of "Ross." He came liere in 1934 to investigate
the riclies of aur country, and travelled
tlirough every province for that purpose. Ris
firat reactian was: What a magnificent country!1
Wliat a rich country l But what a waste I He
was struck by the small population of Canada.
After bis investigations lie remarked, "What
would Germany, witb ber industriali genius,
not do witli aIl this mineral weaitli?" That
gives us some conception of the weaith of
our country.

SENATE

To hasten bar industrial progress and bring
lier to the fore as the richest province in
Canada, Alberta needs today a population of
from thrae to five million carefully selected
people. This is the land of opportunity for
young engineers, chemists and geologists, for
specializad labour and rugged people who can
stand the rigours of our winter climate and
the hardships of the newcomers.
Honourable senators, I fear I have wearied
you with my remarks; but as yet I have not
enumerated haif of the assets of Alberta. Do
you know that today Edmonton is surrounded
by oil wells-and stili lier citizens are maintaining their usual calm.
Before concluding this ]engthy catalogue of
tha resources of my province, may I lie permitted to say a few words about the natural
beauties of Alberta and the cliaracter of its
inhabitants? In 1882 tlie Marquis of Lorne,
then Governor General of Canada, visited
our province. He was so impressed witli the
grandeur and tlie magnificence of our mountains, so overwhelmed by tlie beauty of our
natural and other scenery, that wben lie was
invited to give tlie province a name, he
proudly called it "Albierta" in honour of bis
wife. It bas ever sinca remaîned Allierta, and
oui georgeous lakes stili refleet the image of
tliat beautiful princess.
Honourabla senators maY sa.v te nie tliat
such a country, se endowed witli ail the gifts
of nature, mîust Iiecessaril., have produced a
people witli a certain cliaracteristic. Indeed
it lias. 1 know of no finer people- in Canada
than the inliabitants of Alberta. Tbey are
the sait of the aartli. Like the torcli whicli
is kept burning under the Arnl of Triumph in
Paris in memory of tlie war dead, the spirit
of the old-timers is kept alive in Alberta.
Tlieir bardships and thair sufferings are
remambered, and tliey are blessed for baving
led tlie way to this promised land. The people
have taken root in tlie soul, and their optimism
as to tlie future bas no limits.
One characteristie is rommon to our people.
I do nlot know wlietlier it is because of tlie
bcai1thy and bracing air tliey breathe or the
radiation of tle ricli minerai soul on wliicli
iliey live, but evaryone bas a heart of goid.

As I understand it, the bill provides for a
bonus payment of fifty par cent of the amount
by whicb the cost of mining the gold axeeads
$18 par ounce; this bonus in no avent te lie
more tban $16. If a mine requires more than
that, it must sacure, it elsawbere. Furtber,
the mine must produce 70 per cent gold. The
difficuity the bll presents is this: Wlio in bis

APRIL 26, 1948
The man who took over that mine spent a
million dollars to discover a formula by which
the gold, copper, zinc and suiphur i the ore
couid be separated. Consolidated Smelters
could not do it, nor Anaconda, for any of the
other operating companies. But this mnan
knew that the ore was in the ground and that
his problem was one of separation.
I must candidly ss.y that I do flot believe
this bill will do any good at ahl, because
mining costs will soon overtake the advantage
of the additionaI assistance. The first break
I have observed in the spiral of rising prices
occurred recently in the United States, when
the Steel Corporation announced that it
would cut the price of steel. The employees
recognized that this meant that they could
flot ask for an increase of wages. But the
underlying difficulty of the subi ect before
us is the probiem of costs.
I amn sorry that I cannot agree with the
views of the honourable senator from Cariboo (Hon. Mr. Turgeon). Ini my opinion
we should not have resumed parity of the
Canadian dollar with that of the United
States. I know that readers of Toronto
Saturday Night and publications of that type
are provided with learned arguments why our
money should be at par with that of our
neighbours; but the deplorable fact remains
that within six months after parity was
decreed, our gold position in relation to the
United States began to decline, and it has
been slipping ever since. Indeed it holds its
present position only because of our borrowings from the International Bank. The situation is that our people have lost the benefit
of a percentage differentiai which. had it been
retained, would have done far more for goid
mining than can be done by a little piddiing
measure of this kind. I am disappointed that
any honourable senator would rise in this
chamber to defend such a bill. However, I
noticed that the honourabie senator from St.
Albert (Hon. Mr. Biais) had not much to say
along that line, and that the honourabie senator from Cariboo (Hon. Mr. Turgeon) deait
with this question as briefly as hie could;
indecd 1 thought that what hie was discussing
was Kari Marx and Stalinism, and that hie
hardly got down at ail to the subjeet-matter
of the bill. I admire hîs ability: he knows
that what we have before us is mereiy something to salve the consciences of the goverfiment in face of the demands of the goIdmining companies for help to carry on their
industry.
Hon. Mr. PATERSON: May I interrupt
the honourabie member for a minute? Has
5853-251

hie notîced that according to hate reports, the
production of gold in Canada is steadiiy
increasing?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Very slightly.
Hon. Mr. PATERSON: It is increasing.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: But very slightiy. The
position of large companies sucli as Hudson
B3ay Mining and Flin Flon is due to increases
in the prices of copper and zinc. The samne
conditions account for the risc of Consoiidated
Smelters stock to 110. But such factors wilI
have no effect upon the mines that we are
talking about. The honourable senator cannot narne one mine which this bill will hehp.
I will give my honourable friend the chance,
when I get through, of naniing one; if hie can
do so, I shail be delighted to hear of it.
I do not believe that we in this house
should put on the statute books legislation
which in our heart of hearts we know wiil do
no good. That, in my humble opinion. is
all this bill amounts to. Personalhy it is a
matter of indifference to me whether the
measure becomes law or not. But one sure
thing is that it wiIl not cost the country
much because it wiil not benefit the industry.
In making that statement I believe I voice
the opinion of mining men generally. By and
large the people who are interested in goid
mines feei that this is not a solution of their
probhem.
Hon. T. A. CRERAR: In some respects I
arn not greatiy enamoured of this measure, but
I amn not so pessimistic about its possibilities
as is the honourable leader of the opposition
(Hon. Mr. Haig).
1 doubt very much if the assistance avajiabie
under this bill wiil promnote the deveiopmnent
of many new mines, but I definiteiy believe
th-at it wil quite usefully assist mines now in
production which m-ay he describcd as of a
marginai character; that is, in which the grade
of orc is fairiy low and costs are steadiiy increasing. I dû not think there can be any
doubt thiat the provisions of this bill wouid
materiaily assist siich an enterprise; and, while
I amn not in the confidence of those who conceived or drafted the measure, I amn pretty
certain that that was one of the main purposes
they had. in mind. As to its efleet on the
establishment of new mines, thet, I think, is
probiematicai. Today gohd is sohd at a fixed
price, and when you are seliing a cornmodity
at a fixed price and your costs are steadiily
mounting, with some uncertainty in the minds
of investors as to the ultimate point those costs
may reach, there is naturaiiy hesitation in
investing in new enterprises of this kind. I

SENATE
anticipate that in the next few years conditions
will crystallize, and then there will be more
certainty.
,I amn. fot going t.o enter tonight into a discussion of whether the price of gold should be
increase~d or eurrency should be devalued. That
is no part of this bill. And what rnay be done
in respect of currency adjustments and currency
devaluations elsewhere than in Canada is, of
course, unknown. I anticipate that what wiil
happen in those other coun tries will have some
efl'ect on what we do.
However, I find myseif in agreement with the
main purpose of the bill, and that is why I
rose to make m.y modest contribution to the
discussion.
There is one feature of the bill to w-hich, I
think, attention should be directed. It introduces a new feature in regard to gold-mining.
For the first time in our history we are invited
to pass legisiation which provides for the subsidizing of certain types of mines. On the
general question of subsidies I have pretty
definite views. I think we are getting, somewhat carelessly perhaps, into a realm where the
recognized practice wiIl be to give subsidies
here and there and elsewhere. Every dollar
that is paid in subsidies to maintain these
marginal mines contes out of the taxpayer's
pocket. I arm one of those who in recent days
has been trying to master the complications of
an income tax return, and I know that paying
taxes is neyer -a pleasant proposition. I do feel
that in the easy manner in whieh wve appropriate public money for expenditures, we som-etimes tend to, forget that in the end this rnoney
must corne frorn the taxpayers.
I look with a little foreboding to the future,
when our volume of business and our national
income, iso-called, will not remain as it is
today. We are now in the aftermath of the
war, and business activity everywhere is
buoyant; but I think we rather delude ourselves if we believe that this condition is gomng
to continue for ever. The time is not so many
years ahead when we shail be very carefully
considering expenditu-res of one kind and
another. I expect that within a fcw years the
main topie in this country will be taxation. I
must confess that I do not, regret the coming
of that time, because when taxation is criticized there follows a dloser examination. of
expenditures which resuits in better government.
Honourable senators, I did not intend to
take part in this debate. I hope the honourable leader opposite (Hon. Mr. Haig) will not
mind my suggesting that I think there is
some value in this bill and that it is not quite
the innocuous tbing he made it out to be.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the second tinte.

Natural Resources.
The motion was agreed to.
PRIVATE BILL
SECOND

READING

Hon. T. A. CRERAR moved the second
reading of Bill F-7, an Act to incorporate
Western Pipe Lines.
Ha said: Honourabla senators, although this
measuýre consists of soma thirty-threa sections,
the principle is quite simple. The purpose of
the bill is to incorporate a company to transmit natural gas fromt the district of Calgary,
Alberta, to Winnipeg and intermadiate points.
This bill is unique in that it is the first to
provide for the transmission of natural gas
from one province into two other provinces.
The method involved is not new, becausa it has
been in use in the United States, where there
are over 60,000 miles of main transmission
pipe lines.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: For natural gas?
Hon. Mr. CRERAR: Yes. Natural gas
is piped from Texas to a point as far distant
as the city of Detroit.
There is an abundance of natural gas in
Alberta, and although at one time a great deal
of it was wasted, a few years ago that province
set up a conservation board to regulate the
output of both oil and natural gas. The board
very wisely seeks to conserve oil and natural
gas and to prevent wastage. As happaned in
the Turner Valley, gas is often discovered when
drilling for ou . A type of wet gas exists from
which naphtha can bceaxtracted, leaving a dry
gas that is suitable for the purposes contemplated in this bill. Another interesting fact that
I discovered when studying this bill is that
natural gas has about double the heating or
energy units possessed by gas produced from
coal.
Thare is nothing unusual in the powers
granted by this bill. The company's collection
of gas in Alberta will be subject to the regulations of that province, and the sale of the gas
in the varinus interm-ediate pointa to which it
is to be conveyed will be subject to whatever
municipal or local regulations exist at those
points. The pipe line is d-eclared to be a work
for the general advantage of Canada because
it will pass through three provinces. The provisions governing the securing of the right of
way for laying a pipe lina are found in the
Railway Act.
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: Are the transportation charges also subjeet to the Railway Act?

APRIL 26, 1948
Hon. Mr. CRERAR: I do not think the bill
provides for that, but I think it is probably so,
for a good reason. I am informied that in the
transmission of gas through a pipe line it is
not possible to use the saine procedure as is
followed when transmitting oul. That is to say,
tbe pipe line could not be made of general
service to gas-producing companies. I am not
certain of the facts, but this matter can be
deait with in committee. My understanding is
tbat oul can be measured when it is being put
into the pipe line, but it is rather difficuit to
measure the gas.
Hon. Mr.
pressure.

HUGESSEN:

It depends

on

Hon. Mr. CRERAR: Yes, ,ind upon various
other factors. I would not atempt to inform
the bouse un titis particular point. As I say,
it iEa matter wbich can be inquired into whien
the bill goes to committee.
J was about to say that the provisions of the
Railway Act with respect to the acquisition of
rigbt of way will apply in this case. In developing its enterprise and building its works the
company has to secure the approval of tbe
Board of Transport Commissioners.
Further explanations may be required in
committee, and possibly some change may be
found desirable. The principle of the bill is
to ineorporate a company for the piping of
natural gas froin Alberta as far as Winnipeg,
and to serve intermediate points, and with
power to build branch uines to serve more
distant points. As an illustration, if the pipe
uine followed a fairly direct course from Calgary to Winnipeg, it might ho necessary to
build a branch line to serve the city of Saskatoon, or Yorkton or Prince, Albert.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: Or Rosetown.
Hon. Mr. CRERAR: Or Riosetown.
Hon. A. L. BEAUBIEN: May I ask the
honourablo gentleman if the project is to be
declared a work for the generai advantage of
Canada? If it is, will the company's charges
have to be approved by the provincial Publie
Utilities Commission which. controls light
rates, streetcar fares and so on?
Hon. Mr. CRE.RAR: I am informed that
that wili be the case. The works are declared
works for the general advantage of Canada.
I do not know just wbat particular virtue
there is in that.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: Surely that would take
thom out of the control of the provincial
Public Utilities Commission.
Hon. Mr. CRERAR: I understand not. I
arn advised that the rates, for instance, would

371

be under the municipal authorities. However,
that point cani be cieared up in committee.
Hon. Mr. GERSHAW: May I ask if the
Province of Alberta bas been consulted and
bas givten its sanction to this bill? Natural
gas fields sornetimes become exhausted, and
it seems to me that the province which owns
the resources affected by this bill would be
much interested in any project to pipe them
away to other parts of the country.
Hon. Mr. CRERAR: I amn informed that
the promoters of the bill have discussed the
matter with the appropriate provincial authorities, including, I presume, the Alberta minister
who bas to do with natural resources, and that
there is no objection on their part to this
deveiopment. I should tbink that if a shortage of natural gas arose in the future, Alberta
would stili retain power to serve its own
citizens first. The assumption seems to be
that in Alberta there are almost unlimited
quantities of this natural gas, as there are in
the United States, and that this undertaking
will provide a market for gas and will increase
the production of naphtha or ois from wet
ga.ses and be of general service to the whole
country.
Hlon. Mr. LEGER: So far as I can see, there
seems to be no limit upon the amount of
money that this company may borrow and the
bonds that it may issue. I hope the honourable
senator from Churchill (Hlon. Mr. Crerar) wili
take that into consideration.
Hon. Mr. CRERAR: The capitalization of
the company is to be 2,500,000 no par shares.
Hon. Mr. LEGER: That is ail right, but it
is the borrowing power tbat I arn tbinking of.
Hon. Mr. CRERAR: There is a section
dealing with the borrowing powers.
Hon. Mr. LEGER: Section 30.
Hon. Mr. CRERAR: Section 30 says:
If authorized by by-law, duly passed hy the
directors and, sanctioned by two-thirds in value
of the subseribed stock of the votes cast at a
speciai general meeting of the sharehoiders duly
called for considering the by-law, the directors
of the eompany may from tirne to time:
(a) borrow money upon the credit of the coinpany;
And so on.
Hon. Mr. LEGER: But there is no lirait to
the borrowing power, as tbere usua'liy is in a
bill to ineorporate a company.
Hon. Mr. CRERAR: I shouid think one
limitation is in the fact that the company bas
to get approval of two-thirds otf its sharebolders. And besides that, it could not market
securities or borrow money beyond what lenders tbought ite5 credtit was wortb.

SENATE

Hon. Mr. JOHNSTON: Who are the promoters or provisional directors?
Hon. Mr. CRERAR: The provisional directors are mentioned in section 2.
Hon. Mr. JOHNSTON: I have not a copy
of the bill.
Hon. Mr. CRERAR: Section 2 says:
Lionel D. M. Baxter, financial agent, Edward
A. Nanton, broker, David A. B. Murray, broker,
Gordon P. Osler, broker, and Harold G. Tucker,
insurance manager, all of the city of Winnipeg,
in the province of Manitoba, are incorporated
under the name of Western Pipe Lines.
The company is promoted by the firm of
Osler, Hammond and Nanton, in the city of
Winnipeg.

Hon. Mr. PATERSON: Clause (g) of section 9 says that the company may, for the
purpose of its undertaking:
lay or construct the pipe lines in, upon, across,
under or over any railway, tramway or body
of water.
Just imagine laying a pipe line upon a railway
or tramway!
Hon. Mr. CRERAR: What the company
does in that respect will have to be approved
by the Transport Board.
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: Yes, under section
13.
Hon. Mr. CRERAR: I do not think there is
any doubt about that.

Hon. A. L. BEAUBIEN: Section 9 reads:
9. The company may, for the purpose of its
undertaking; (a) enter into and upon any Crowin
land owned or held either in the right of the
Dominion of Canada or of the provinces of
Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba, without
previous licence therefor, or into or upon the
.and of any person whomsoever lying in the
intended route of the said pipe line or lines,
and make surveys, examinations or other necessary arrangements on such land for fixing the
site of the pipe lines and set out and ascertain
such parts of the land as are neeessary and
proper for the same.

The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the second time.

In other words, this gives the company power
to go on to lands owned by the Crown, either
in the right of the dominion or of the province,
without any permission at al]. It seems to be
a very dangerous section.

REPORT OF COMMITTEE

Hon. Mr. CRERAR: The company would
go about securing land for its pipe lines in the
same way as a railway company would go
about getting a right of way.
Hon. A. L. BEAUBIEN: Then the company will surely not be under the control of
the provincial Public Utilities Commission,
will it?
Hon. Mr. CRERAR: I think so. If it pipes
gas to Winnipeg, for instance, its rates will
have to be competitive, in any event, with the
charges for electrical energy and other fuels,
and my understanding is that they will also
be subject to provincial and municipal regulations.
Hon. A. L. BEAUBIEN: Not if the work is
declared to be for the general advantage of
Canada, because then it will corne entirely
under the Board of Transport Commissioners.
Hon. Mr. CRERAR: I do not think my
honourable friend is right, but that is a matter
we can thrash out in committee.

APPENDIX
Statement by the International Monetary Fund
issued December 11, 1947
The International Monetary Fund has a
responsibi-lity to see that the gold policies of
its members do not undermine or threaten to
undermine exchange stability. Consequently,
every member which proposes to introduce new
measures to subsidize the production of gold
is under obligation to consult with the fund
on the specific measures to be introduced.
Under article IV, section 2, of the articles of
agreement of the fund, members are prohibited
from buying gold at a price above parity plus
the prescribed margin. In the view of the fund
a subsidy in the form of a uniform payment
per ounce for all or part of the gold produced
would constitute an increase in price which
would not be permissible if the total price paid
by the member for gold were thereby to
become in excess of parity plus the prescribed
margin.
Subsidies involving payments in
another form may also, depending upon their
nature, constitute an increase in price.
Under article IV, section 4(a), each member
of the fund "undertakes to collaborate with the
fund to promote exchange stability, to maintain orderly exchange arrangements with other
members, and to avoid competitive exchange
alterations". Subsidies on gold production
regardless of their form are inconsistent with
article IV, section 4(a), if they undermine or
threaten to undermine exchange stability. This
would be the case, for example, if subsidies
were to cast widespread doubt on the uniformity of the monetary value of gold in all member countries.
Subsidies which do not directly affect
exchange stability may nevertheless contribute
directly or indirectly to monetary instability in
other countries and hence be of concern to the
fund.
A determination by the fund that a proposed
subsidy is not inconsistent with the foregoing
principles will depend upon the circumstances
in each case. Moroeover, the fund may find
that subsidies which are justified at any one
time may, because of changing conditions and
changing effects, later prove to be inconsistent
with the foregoing principles. In order to

carry out its objectives the fund will continue
to study and to review with its members their
gold policies and any proposed changes to
determine if they are consonant with the provisions of the fund agreement and conducive to
a sound international policy regarding gold.
Statement by the International Monetary Fund
issued on December 11, 1947, for release in
the morning papers of December 12, 1947
The Canadian government has consulted
with the fund regarding its proposed gold
production subsidy and has today made an
announcement on this subject. The fund has
examined the present Canadian proposal in
the light of its own general statement of policy
published today. The fund has determined
that in the present circumstances the proposed
Canadian action is not inconsistent with the
policy stated by the fund.
Press Release by National Advisory Couneil
The United States government welcomes the
statement of the International Monetary Fund
respecting measures to subsidize the production of gold. The expressed intention of the
fund to keep under review the gold policies
of its members in the light of a sound international gold policy is an important forward
step in the field of international financial
co-operation.
The United States, as a gold-buying country,
has a peculiar and continuing interest in the
role which gold subsidies may come to play in
the production, movement and price of gold.
In particular, the United States would view
with disfavour any tendencies for countries to
become dependent on subsidized gold production as a solution to the problem of arriving
at and maintaining equilibrium in the balance
of international payments.
In the view of the council there are no
grounds which would justfy instituting a subsidy to encourage the production of gold in
this country. The present gold stocks of the
United States amount to no 'less than $22-7
billion. In the first eleven months of 1947 gold
purchased by the United States from foreign
countries amounted to $2.7 billion.

DAIRY INDUSTRY BILL
SECOND

READING

The Senate resumed from Wednesday,
April 21 the adjourned debate on the motion
of Hon. Mr. Euler for the second reading of
Bill B, an Act to amend The Dairy Industry
Act.
Hon. Mr. HOWARD: This bill has been
on the order paper for a long time. I believe
that someone is to speak on it today. Tomorrow the government leader (Hon. Mr.
Robertson) will speak, and then, of course,
the honourable senator from Waterloo (Hon.
Mr. Euler) will close the debate, and we shall
have a vote.
Hon. G. P. CAMPBELL: Honourable
senators, I desire to add a few words to what
bas been said in support of this bill to amend
the Dairy Industry Act. Before I discuss the
merits of the measure, however, may 1 compliment the honourable senator from Waterloo (Hon. Mr. Euler) for bis courage and
persistence in keeping this legislation before
the house and this issue before the public.
There is great public interest in the bill;
neyer before, I believe, has popular opinion
sbown itself so strongly in favour of any other
measure whicb bas come before us.
In trying to reacb a conclusion on tbe
matter, 1 am sure that ail of us respect the
5853-26

points of view expressed by others who have
taken part in the debate. It may be said,
I think, that hardly any person either in this
bouse or in another place does not, in principle,
favour the removal of the ban against the
importation, manufacture or sale of such a
wholesome food produet as margarine. One
consideration which. prevents some bonourable
members fromn supporting the bill is their
honest conviction that it may cause some
injury to those engaged in the dairy industry.
In tbe course of tbe present debate many
speakers have argued that the passage of the
measure would seriously injure the farming
community as a whole. It seems to be
assumed tbat producers in every brancb of
farming are opposed to such legislation. I
do flot believe tbat that is so. In many sectins of this country-and I speak particularly
of Ontario-there are farmers wbo wboleheartedly support the removal of tbe present
prohibitory law. Some of them are engaged
in the dairy industry, but they are convinced
that if tbe prohibition against the importation
of margarine were removed tbe volume oi
butter sales would not be affected. I for one
believe tbat competition is good for almost
any industry or line of business.
When we come to analyse the real issues
involved in this bill we find, first, tbat oleomargarine is now recognized by medical
journals, by medical science, and by everyone in a position to know the facts, as a
wholesome food product.
In tbe second place, tbe manufacture and
sale of oleomargarine is permitted in every
other country in the world. Canada alone
probibits not only its importation but also
its manufacture and sale. I gubmit that there
is no reason why tbe prohibition should be
continued in Canada when tbey do not find
it necessary in so many other countries tbat
are dependent upon dairying as one of their
chief industries.
Third, I submit that the butter shortage of
today is even greater than it was following the
last war. Consequently we .must assume that
tbe dairy industry has been unable to keep up
its production in order to supply the wants and
needs of the Canadian people; and of course
it is prohibited from exporting its products to
other countries. As long as the public is probibited fromn buying any substitute for butter
this shortage will continue to exist.
Fourth, we find a tremendous demand from
all classes of society for oleomargarine as a
substitute for butter. I believe that one of
the best letters I bave seen on tbis subject
appeared in Saturday's edition of the Toronto
Globe and Mail. It is written by a Mrs.

SENATE

Joseph Day of Chatham, Ontario, a city which,
I suppose, is superior to Winnipeg in that it
is situated in the banner county of Kent where
a considerable amount of dairying is carried
on. Mrs. Day expresses the point of view of
many people throughout the entire country,
and sncb a letter must carry a good deal of
weight. It je headed, "No butter, no margarine,
no help", and with leavo of the Sonate I should
like to read it:
When doing my week-end marketing last week
the grocers were doling out butter in halfpounds, une to a cuetomer. My dairyman, from
whom I get my butter, has been doing the samie,
and Sund-ay morning when I asked for butter
he told me his. supply was used up Saturday and
hoe would flot have any more until Tuesday.
This week the newspapere give us the encouraging information -the supply of butter will be
ample in June, so in the five or six weeks interimt
it is evident that the present shortage must continue, and of course the use of margarine prohibited.
The question miglit weIl be asked, does ur
Government represeïrit the dariy industry or does
it represent the citizens in general who electod
it and whose intereste it is pledged ýto promote?
I quote f rom Adam Smith's Weelth of Nations:
"In every country it is always iu the interests
of the great body of the people te buy whatever they want of those who seil it the cheapest.*"
One wonders just how long we must continue
to be patient with this miscarriage of justice
against the public, when just a little courage,
fairness and honest statesmanship is aIl that is
necessary to have Canada benefit f rom. the
manufacture and sale of this wholesome and
mucb-noeded food produet.
Honourable senators, I think that letter
expresses the view of many Canadians who
feel that to continue the prohibition against
the importation, manufacture and sale of a
wholesome food product which is in short
supply in Canada, is to deprive them of a
right which they as individuals should have in
this country. It je for these reasons that 1
strongly support this bill at the present time.
In considering the prohibitory legisiation it
is rather interesting tu review its history. I
think it wus the late senator fromi St. Catharines who so ably touched upon this during the
debate last year. H1e pointod ont that in order
to get jnrisdiction to passe the legisia.tion the
federal parliament inserted in it a recital deelaring that the butter substitute, or oleomargarine, was unfit for hurnan consumption. I
submait that at the time that was the only way
in which the Dominion parliament could get
power to pass a law prohibiting the manufacture
and sale of the produet in any of the provinces
of Canada. That rocital was dropped from the
legislation during the consolidation of the
stq'utes following 1886.
Since thon varions acts have been passed. and
without discussing them in detail I should like
+.o make a reference to them for the record. In

1903 an act, cited as the Butter Act, 1903, was
passed tu prohibit the importation, manufacture or sale of adulterated, processed or renovated butter, oleomargarine, butterine or other
substitutes for butter and to prevent the improper marketing of butter. In 1906 the law
was re-enacted in almost identical form, and is
to be found in the Revised Statutes of Canada
1906, Chapter 85, Part 8. The Dairy Indnstry
Act, 1914, 4 and 5 George V, Chapter 7, was
passed in 1914 to regulate the manufacture and
sale of dairy products and to pruhibit the
manufacture or sale of butter substitutes. Thon
in 1919, when a butter shortage developed in
this country, the government to*ok the initiative
in introducing a bill which permitted, under
certain conditions, the importation, manufacture and sale of oleomnargarine. That measure,
which was passed by parliament, became the
Oleomargarine Act, 10 George V, Chapter 24,
and perm'itted the importation of oleomiargarine into Canada iintil the 31st of August,
1920, and the sale until the lst of March, 1921.
In 1920 the time for the importation and manufacture of the product was extonded until
August 31, 1921, and for the sale, until March 1,
1922. In 1921, as there was stili a shortage of
butter, the act was again extended to permit
importation and manufacture until August 31,
1922, and sale until March 1, 1923.
Hon. A. L. BEAUBIEN: Was that extension
made by order in council?
Hon. Mr. CAMPBELL: No, the extension
w-as made by act of parliament in each case.
In 1922 an act was passed extending permission
for the importation and manufacture until
August 31, 1923, and for the sale until March 1,
1924. From that timne on there were no fnrther
extensions.
I submait to honourable members that at
that time the government considered it necessary to provide the Canadian people with a
substitute for butter, and that oleomargarine
thon w-as not as vaînable a food as it is today.
1 think we will aIl agree that the national
incume of this country in thoso days was not
anything like what it is at prosent, and that
the demand for butter or butter substitute
ivas not as great as it is now. Fnrther, the
fact is that the milk producor has outlets today
which he nover had before.
It seems to me, honourable senators, that
since we have no record of any damage having
been done to the dairy industry of this country
during the five-year poriod following the Iast
w-ai- we can assume that nu damage would ho
dune to this industry if the ban on oleomargarine w-ere removed, as it bas been in uther
countries.

APRIL 27, 1948
Hon. Mr. LEGER: Can the honourable
senator tell me why the law was repealed, if
there was no damage done?
Hon. Mr. CAMPBELL: The legisiation permitted the sale, importation and manufacture
of oleomargarine. The original act was neyer
changed. It remained on the statute books
as a prohibition; but enabling legisiation was
passed from. time to time to permitHon. Mr. QUINN: It ran out at a specified time.
Somne Hon. SENATORS: No.
Hon. Mr. QUINN: It was enacted only for
a specified period.
Hon. Mr. CAMPBELL: Yes. Legislation
was enacted during the period from. 1919 to
1922.
Hon. Mr. QUINN: And it was extended
£romn year to year..
Hon. Mr. CAMPBELL: That is true; and
in spite of the prohibitory law it permitted the
importation, manufacture and sale of oleomargarine within Canada. From. 1922-1923 no
furfher extensions were granted.
Hon. Mr. QUINN: It expired automatically,
did it not?
Hon. Mr. CAMPBELL: It expired automatically.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Will the honourable
gentleman please answer a question concerning
a point which I have neyer quite understood?
The same goverfiment was in power in 1924
as in 1922; this partîcular legisiation was
extended to 1924, and then stopped. Why did
not the government enact a general law?
Hon. Mr. CAMPBELL: I cannot answer
that question.
Perhaps some honourable
senator who was in the cabinet at that time
could supply the information. The honourable
gentleman from Waterloo (Hon. Mr. Euler)
would know the nnswer. I would assume that
it was then because of pressure from. the dairy
industryHon. Mr. EULER: Exactly.
Hon. Mr. CAMPBELL: -which prevented
the prohibitory law fromn beîng taken off the
statute books and also prevented further
extensions being granted.
Hon. Mr., EULER: The same reasons we
have now.
Hon. Mr. CAMPBELL: With respect, I say
that the only reason any honourable member
of this house, or of the other place, would have
for voting against this bill would be political pressure brought f0 bear by au important
group in this country.
5853-26 J

Hon. Mr. LEGER: My friend is assuming
a great deal when he says that.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: May I ask my friend if he
was in the house when the honourable gentleman from. Churchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar) spoke
the other day?
Hon. Mr. CAMPBELL: I was flot.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I arn sorry, because he
gave the reason why certain things happened..
Hon. Mr. CAMPBELL: I submît, with ail
respect to the dairy industry, that it wiil not
be harmed by the removal of this prohibitory
]aw, thus permitting oleomargarine, butterine,
or any other butter substitute to be imported,
sold and distributed within Canada. If any
argument for its removal is needed, one can
point to other countries, particularly Denmark,
where, I arn told, the farmers who make and
seli butter buy margarine.
Hon. A. L. BEAUBIEN: But the people of
that country do flot consume twenty-eight
pounds of butter per capita. They export it.ý
Hon. Mr. CAMPBELL: True, they do flot
consume as much as we do. We consume more
butter than the people of any other country in
the würld. But if that is true, our need for
more butter, or a substitute for it, is greater
than that of any other country.
From time to time the dairy industry and
other branches of farming have argued that
they should be permitted to export their
products abroad. I entirely agree with that
contention. I arn opposed to any prohibition
against export; but at the same time, as long
as the farmers stand in the way of the
importation of a butter substitute I feel that
they cannot say much in support of their contention that they should be permitfed to send
their products abroad.
I should like to deal for a few moments with
certain provisions of the Dairy Indusfry Act
which to me are beyond the compefence of the
Parliament of Canada f0 enact. So far as the
manufacture of oleomargarine, butterine or any
other butter Qubstitute within any province for
distribution in that province is concerned, I
submit that it is a matter of property and civil
rights, which under the provisions offthe British
North America Act are wholly within the competence of the provincial government. So far
as the provisions of the Dairy Industry Act are
concerned, I bejlieve that any attempt f0 prohibit the manufacture and sale of a product
within the province of Ontario is ultra vires of
the Parliament of Canada. If that is so, as I
subînit it is, I contend that the law should be
amended at least f0 that extent.

SENATE
It is rather difficuit to advance an argument
on this subject that has not already been
toucbed upon. I therefore shall fot detain the
bouse at any great length this afternoon. But
1 wish to point out that this bill, if passed, will
give the people a right to which they are
entitled as individuals within this country,
and failure to pass it is tantamount to legisla;ting in favour of a certain class and against
the great masses who se often have expressed
their views on this subject.
I submit, honourable sen-aters, that this
bouse is the proper place for this legislation
to originate. It is the place where sucb a
measure sbould be carefully studied. I suggest
to bonourable members that tomorrow we
should vote in favour of second reading, and
then refer the bill to a cemrnittee where its
varjous provisions and their effect upon the
dairy industry can be inquircd into. I repeat
that certain provisions of the Dairy Industry
Act as it now stands on the statute books, are
v1tra vires of the Dominion Parliament.

1 arn sure honourable members are strongly
in favour of the removal of this probibitory
law; and if that can be done without injury
to the dairy industry, no one in this bouse or
the otber sbould raise any objection. I think
it unique that in the other bouse there are
political parties who claim to represent the
masses of the people-probably even more so
at times than the governrnent-but who do nlot
speak eut on behalf of the masses of people

in the cities who cannot secure butter eitber
because they are unable to pay the high
prices or, if 'tbey can pay them, because none
is available. I believe that every member of
cîther bouse wbe looks at this proposai
sensihly. bonestly and fairly, will cornte to the
conclusion thtat tbe prohibition sbould ha
rernoved. Then if any steps are necessary for
tbe protection of tbe dairy industry by way of
duity, as bias been advocated by some members,
that matter can be faced in the usual way and
protection can be given.
In conclusion I would rernind honourablc
senators tbat one cannot point te the product

of any other industry in this ceuntry wbicb is
le sucb dernand as margarine and against
whicb there is a prohibition te manufacture.
To say tbat we should continue tbis prohibitien as a protection seems te me te be
in
principle
and
undemecratic,
wrong
un-Liberal.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, bear.
Hon. Mr. HORNER: Wbat dees my friend
think of tbe scveral other prohibitions in
force for the protection of certain classes of
ir.duist.ry in this country? Why net bave those
rreved first?

Hon. Mr. EULER: Wbat are tbey?
Hon. Mr. HORNER: For instance, the
eastern fur farrner is protected by a prohibition against the shipping of horses to the
United States for fox meat. That prohibition
is for the protection of the fox raiser in
eastern Canada.
Hon. Mr. EULER: But there is ne prohibitien against competitien wvitbin Canada in the
industry of fox farming, as there is with
respect te margarine.
Hon. Mr. HORNER: There is a prohibition,
and it affects the man wlio wisbes te salI bis
herses.
Hon. A. K. HUGESSEN: Honourable senators, I arn rising te take part in this debate
fer oe reason only. My view on this legisiatien is wall known. I supported it two years
age, I supportad it last year, and I bave every
intention of supperting it when it cornes te a
vote tomorrow.
Tbe reason I wisli te say a word or two
tbis afternoon arises eut of sornething wbicb
lias taken place since our debata of last year.
As bonourable members wbo cernte frein
Montreal may know, w-e have in that city a
body known as the Welfare Fed'eration, a
charitable ýorganization whosa object it is te
look ýafter the interests of the Protestant poor
of our city. In years past I had sornething
te do with that organization, and it 50
happans that for a number of years I was the
president of the Cbild Care Agency iinder the
federation.
Oe of the bodies which ferrns a constituient part of tha Welfare Faderation is known
as the Family Welfare Association.
Some
two or thrae mentbs age the board of
directers of that body adopted unanirneusly
a resadution asking for the removal of the
prohibition on margarine. I wanted te know
why that resolution was adepted, and in
order te find eut I get ini teucb witb the
secretary of the Farniily Welfare Association.
This is what I discovcred.
The asseciation
deals witb sevaral thotisand peop)le of the
Protestant faitb in Mentreal who are arnong
the very poorest members of our cemrnunit '
-people wbo for some reason or another,
threugb ne fault of their ewn, bave ne incomes
or very srnall incomes; and it is the business
of the association
to supplement
thair
resources by a srnall daily suim withi which
they can purchasa food. -Now1 arn told that,
as a consequanca of tha increase in the cest
of butter and of the general increase in tha
price of food, the prasent position is that

means with which to buy butter; and they
cannot buy anything else te spread upon
their bread. There are similar organizations
dealing 'with the very much larger Frenchspeaking cornmunity, with the EnglishCatholic cornrunity, and with the Jewish
cornrunity, and ail these are in the same
position. In thîs one city of Montreal, from
wbich I corne, rnany thousands of our poorest
people are not able to buy anything to place
upon their bread. Se the effect of this prohihition is to. protect the interests or the suppoeed
interests of the dairy industry at the expense
of the very poorest of our population, for what
I have said holds good, I arn sure, flot only of
Montreal but of ahl the larger and srnaller
urban centres of the country.
With every other honourable senator,' I
believe that the farming population bas the
right to its fair share of the national incorne.
I have always believed that, and I arn sure
that every other senator has too. But when
one atternpts to defend the protection of a
portion of the farrning population at the cost
of the poor, I may be allowed to quote an
old tag renernbered. frorn the days when I
learned Latin: non tali awdilio nec de! ensoribus istis-which means, as ahl honourable
senators know, not with help such as that nor
with weapons such as those.
I suggest to honourable senators that the
rnethod we should adopt to ensure the welIbeing of our farrning population-in which,
c>f course, I include the dairy industryshould be very different frorn one which bas
The
the effect which I have rnentioned.
tendency in the past few years has been to
put forward legisiation designed to assure
our farrning population of its fair proportion
of the incorne of the country. This policy
can be exemplified, perhaps, by the wheat
agreernent with Great Britain, whereby the
farrner gets a fair price for his wheat regardless of what the masrket price rnay be. Let
me also ernmplify the legislation which wc
adopted two years agoHon. Mr. HORNER: So far it arnounts to
a dollar a bushel less than the farrner would
have received on an open rnarket. That is ahi
the belp hie has had frorn that source.
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: But I do not think
rny bonourable friend frorn Blaine Lake wil
deny that bie is getting a price which gives hirn
a profit on bis cost of production.
Hon. Mr. HORNER: I will deny it. When
a rnan harvests only two or three bushels to
the acre and bas to feed cattle six rnonths in
the year, I say it is not a profitable deal.

Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: I do not propose to
enter into a controversy with the bonourable
senator frorn Blaine Lake on the subject of
wbeat growing, about wbicb hie knows a great
deal rnore than 1 do. But I was going to say
tbat there are other kînds of hegishation which
we bave adopted in the last few years, along
lînes upon which we in this parliarnent can
proceed, to provide a decent incorne for the
dairy farrner. For exarnple, there is the legislation that we put through two years ago to
provide a floor for agricultural prices. It rnay
well be that in future tbe treasury of tbis
country will have to corne to the support of
the dairy farrner, if it sbould turn out that
hie is not getting a fair return for bis product.
And that, I say, is the rnetbod which you
sbould adopt if you wish to protect the dairy
industry: not the rnetbod whieh is inherent in
the existing legisIation. The present act, I
sbould point out, was neyer designed for the
protection of the dairy industry at all, but ws
brought in as a health measure, and a health
mensure alone; but by sorne strange metarnorphosis over a period of years it bas turned
into and becorne a measure which is supposed
to be in the interests of the dairy industry.
Hon. Mr. HORNER: I take it that the
honourable senator has neyer read the speecb
of the late Dr. Motherwell on that legisîntion,
or bie would not say that its purpose was to
protect the dairy farrner.
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: I neyer knew before
that rny bonourable frîcnd was a supporter of
the late Dr. Motherwell. I arn glad to know
that hie was.
As I have said, honourable senators, the only
reason 1 entered this debate was to bring
before the house the situation of tbe people
in our large cities, wbo are in the rnost
desperate poverty; and rny only purpose in
venturing to infiict these rernarks on the bouse
is that 1 feel I could not return to Montreal
and face tbe people of rny city without putting
rnyself on record as being in favour of this
legislation.
Hon. J. J. KINLEY: Honourable senators,
in rising to speak on the bill which is hefore
the house, I rnay state that I voted againit
it last year, when it was defeated, and that t
arn still of the sarne opinion and shaîl vote
against it again.
I was interested ini the rernarks of the two
Iast speakers. They seern to be the beavy
artillery of those in favour of mnargarine: two
erninent corporation lawyers, called upon to
advocate the interests of the under-privileged
in this country. I cornplirnent tbern on tbeir
interest. and assuqire them that ail of us share

SENATE

it and are trying to do what we can, as we see
our duty, on behalf of the under-privi-leged.
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: Do it in a practical
way, then.
Hon. Mr. KINLEY: For the first time in
many years this bill has found a sponsor in
the lower house. There are four parties and
several independent groups in the lower house,
and not one of them has adopted the principle
of this bill as a policy. If the statement
made by my honourable friend from Toronto
(Hon. Mr. Campbell) about the mass of public opinion in this country is true, we should
find at least one of these parties making this
principle a plank in their political platform.
I was rather surprised at the speech made
by the honourable senator from Churchill
(Hon. Mr. Crerar) and also at the one
delivered by the honourable senator from
Toronto this afternoon. They suggest that
the reason we oppose this bill is that we fear
a pressure group of the dairy industry and,
therefore, that the people who have supported
the existing law for the last twenty years
must have had an ulterior motive. I think
they put too low an estimate on the standard
of our public life.
Hon. Mr. CRERAR: Honourable senators,
I want to correct my honourable friend. In
my remarks on the bill there was no such
implication as he now states.
Hon. Mr. KINLEY: I have Hansard
before me. I shall not argue with my honourable friend, but I shall read what he said.
Hon. Mr. CRERAR: Very good.
Hon. Mr. KINLEY: At page 332 of
Hansard my honourable friend is reported as
follows:
The Dairy Council of Canada has been quite
active in pressing its point of view. I have no
fault to find with it for that; but it must equally
afford to others the right of presenting their
point of view. So long as the Dairy Council confines itself to argument, I have no objection
whatever; but I object decidedly to the gentle
intimation sometimes given that if this measure
goes through those who support it in parliament
will be marked men. I resent that sort of thing
with all my being, because it is a degradation of
our whole democratic concept of government.
Then my honourable friend went further
in his remarks, and at page 334 of Hansard
I find that he said this:
If it were not for the fear that someone somewhere would endeavour to exploit margarine te
prejudice the people in the matter of elec.tions,
there is no doubt that parliament would accept
this proposed measure without delay.
My honourable friend even went further
when lie said that he suffered a personal defeat

in the federal elections of 1930 largely by
reason of a controversy then current about
butter in Canada.
Hon. Mr. CRERAR: My honourable friend
should be fair.
What I indicated in my
remarks was that I was opposed to that sort
of thing. If my friend thinks there is no
exercise of pressure by groups, he had better
go up to the telegraph offices and check the
number of telegrams that have come into this
building in the last few days.
Hon. Mr. KINLEY: They must have forgotten me, because I received only one.
Hon. Mr. CRERAR: They did not forget
me.
Hon. Mr. KINLEY: I have just quoted
from Hansard what the honourable senator
said, and my observation in reply is that lie
places a very low estimate on the standard of
public life in this country over many years.
Parliamentarians are not afraid of losing votes,
nor do they want to favour one group rather
than another. They possess a sense of justice
and fair play and will net vote for something
simply because everybody in the country is
clamouring for it. If it is true that everybody
in Canada is clamouring for the passage of
this bill-you cannot have it both ways-why
should anyone who is scared of the majority
be scared also of the minority?
A recent Gallup poll shows that of the
people who were approached, 80 per cent were
in favour of margarine. I am not surprised at
that. There has been terrifie pressure from
the urban press in Canada and the United
States for the sale of oleomargarine.
Hon. Mr. DAVID: Why? It is because the
public want it.
Hon. Mr. KINLEY: It may be because the
love of money is the root of all evil.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. EULER: Does my honourable
friend suggest that our newspapers are being
bribed to publish the honestly-expressed opinions of their readers?
Hon. Mr. KINLEY: I have here before
me a big advertisement from Life magazine,
which is one of the-most glamorous publications in the United States.
Hon. Mr. EULER: It is an American magazine?
Hon. Mr. KINLEY: Yes.
Hon. Mr. EULER: What about a Canadian magazine?
Hon. Mr. KINLEY: Wait a minute. Only
the wealthy could buy that kind of advertis-

APRIL 27, 1948
ing. In the same number of the magazine
appears an editorial entitled "Margarine vs
Butter," which la a splendid article in support
of the promotion of margarine. There la the
situation.
Hon. Mr. EULER: That la in the United
States.
Hon. Mr. KINLEY: I can quite understand
why the urban press of this country would be
in favour of margarine. Some people believe
that if this bill were passed a favourable
economnic condition would prevail, and they
look at it without having regard to a longterm principle which affects the best intereste
of our country.
Honourable senators, I would say the policy
of any government la expressed la its legislation. The ban placed on margarine is to be
faund not only in our dairy legislation but also
in the schedule of the Customs Act. My
honourable frienda must know that the passage
of this bill by parliament would not allow
margarine to be imported into Canada.
Hon. Mr. EULER: Why?
Hon. Mr. KINLEY: Because its importation is prohibited by the schedule to the
Customs Act, which is governrnent policy, and
government policy is only changed by the
budget. Until the budget and the Customs
Act are changed the importation of margarine
will be banned.
Hon. Mr. EULER: What is there in the
Customs Act which prohibîts the importation
of margarine?
Hon. Mr. KINLEY: It is prohibited by the
achedule to the act.
Hon. Mr. CRERAR: My honourable friend
(Hon. Mr. Kinley) is quite mistaken. It is
prohibited by a specifie law made for that
purpose.
Hon. Mr. KINLEY: My honourable friend
(Hon. Mr. Crerar) has had more parliarnentary
experience than I have had, but he had better
read the statutes, because the schedule to the
Customs Act provides that the importation
into Canada of oleomargarine, among other
items, is prohibited.
Hon. Mr. CRERAR: It is prohibited by the
Dairy Industry Act.
Hon. Mr. KINLEY: 1 did not say otherwise; but it is prohibited by the Customs Act,
and that represents the policy of the government. Here in the Senate I arn speaking publicly, and if my honourable friends find anything wrong they can corne and tell me; but
I advise the two honourable veterana that they
are wrong.

381

Hon. Mr. EULER: What is your point? If
the prohibition already exists in the Dairy
Industry Act what is added 'by putting it into
the Customs Act?
Hon. Mr. KINLEY: I arn just stating the
facts, and my honourable friend can analyse
thern as he likes.
My friends have, tried to bring in the
Geneva agreement, and they argue that we
who oppose this bill are outmoded because
that agreement states that we must allow
oleoniargarine to corne into Canada. I was
surprised to hear that we had let our internai
affairs become the subject of international
dictation; but when I read the agreement and
the charter, with my layman'a eyes 1 could
find nothing which would stop us from banning
the importation of margarine if we wanted to
ban it. I noticed that the two legal senators
who spoke today did not stress that point
either.
Honourable Mr. St. Laurent made a statement in reference to this matter. It appeared
in the Halifax Chronicle of Tuesday, March 2,
1948, under the heading "Restrictions on margarine can only be removed by parliament St.
Laurent says". The article reads as follows:
Restriction on Canadian importation or manufacture of margarine is the responsibility of parliament and will not be affected by the international trade agreements under revision at
Havana, External Affairs Minister St. Laurent
told the annual convention of the National Dairy
Council here today.
Mr. St. Laurent told how prohibition of manufacture and sale of margarine has been part of
the Canadian Dairy Act for a quarter of a century and he said the question of lifting the restriction "arises out of the international trade
agreements."
One of their general provisions is that no one
of the contracting parties shail institute or
maintain prohibition against the importation
into its territory of the products of ainother
contracting. party, except in certain specified
euses.
Hon. Mr. DAVID: Amen!
Hon. Mr. EULER: You are making our
argument now.
Hon. Mr. KINLEY: The article continues:
We in Canada are very much interested in a
rule of that kind as a general mile which would
facilitate the entry of our surpluses in-to the
markets of all the contracting countries, said
the speaker. He added, however, that provisional application of the Geneva agreement does
not require Canada to alter its prohibition
againet the importation of margarine, and revision of the agreement at Havana will not affect
the dairy industry.
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: May I ask what
my honourable friend la reading frorn?

SENATE
Hon. Mr. KINLEY: 1 arn reading from an
article in the Halifax Chronicle, a very good
newspaper.
The act wjll rernain as it is unless and unti]
parliament sees fit to change it, said Mr. St.
Laurent.
If there is anything in the agreement -which
would require parliament either to, refuse to
ratify it and thus lose the suhatantial benefits iýt
means to Canada's trade, or accept it to get those
beniefits and have .to repeal its pýrohibition
against the importation of oleomargarine, there
is nothing and there will be nothing to prev'ent
parliament, if it sees fit to do so, to replace that
prohibition by just as higli an import duty as
parliament may feel is proper or just as high
an excise tax as parliament may decide to enact.
It is not part of what I arn prepared to say
to you today to fo-recast what the governiment
and what parliament are apt to do or will do,
Mr. St. Laurent added.
Even if we wanted to manufacture some oleomargarine here, in Canada, we *would have to
take the oils and fats away f rom something
else for which they are heing uscd at presenit.
The overaîl quantity, including what ýwent into
oleomargarine, would not in any case be any
greater than At is at the present time.
The Minister of Externat Afl'airs said two

things: first, that this argument which we
have heard here about the Geneva agreemcnt falis to the ground, and, second, that
there arc no oils available for the manufacture
of oleomargarine in Canada, and that if we
did use oils for that purpose there would be
a shortage of those oils for some other purpose.

Margarine is pretty slippery.

The other night at Toronto a speech wvas
made hy another member of the cabinet, Mr.
Gregg, the Minister of Veterans Affairs. He
cornes from Fredericton, New Brunswick. He
said that he was opposed to lifting the ban on
oleornargarine, because that would mean depriving hungry Europe of certain necessary
foods. That is a second minister of the Crown
who feels that if we made oleomargarine in
this country we would have to use ingredients
that should properly go to somcbody else.
Supporters of the bill have made an appeal
here on behaif of children. Weil, I too am

interested in children. In the community
where I five we are very proud of our ebildren.
Hon. Mr. DUFF: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. KINLEY: In our plant we have
200 men, and they probably would like to sec
the ban on margarine removed, because they

think they would get butter a littie eheaper

Hon. Mr. KINLEY: In Canada our per
capita consumption of butter averages about
28-6 pounds a year; the United States average
of butter and margarine cornbined, including
4 pounds of margarine, is 14-7 pounds. In other
words, we get twice as much butter per person
in Canada as they do in the UJnited States; so
if we are starving for butter, what is the condition of the American people?
Hon. Mr. QUINN: We need more.
Hon. Mr. EULER: They have margarine.

Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: Is my bonourable
friend making a proper comparison?
Hon. Mr. KINLEY: 1 ain, eomparing this
country with the United States. wbere they
have the higliest standard of living in the
world.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: Would my honourable friend compare the class in the United
States which cannot afford to biiy butter with
the elass in Canada which cannot afford to buy
butter?
Hon. Mr. RINLEY: I do not like to deal
with classes.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: Thev are the ones
wvho are interested.

Hon. Mr. KINLEY: Our honourable frieuds
here have told us that the consumption of mnilk
has gone up enormously in the hast few years,
and I think that is true. But let us nut furget
th:at every time a person drinks a quart of miilk,
he gets an ounce and a haîf of butter fat in the
finest form in wvhich it can be taken into the
body.
Supporters of the bill sav that the highi price
of butter makes a butter substitute, necessary.
Weil. butter is cheaper in Canada than in any
other place in the world thiat 1 know of, except
New Zealand. It is $1 a pound in the United

APRIL 27, 1948
In my home district milk sells at 16 cents a
quart, of whieh the fariner reoeives about 10
cents. Most of the remiaining 6 cents goes to
pay for processing, for doing things to rnilk
that were nof done to it in the early days.
Anyone who thinks the price of m.ik is too
high should compare it with the prices of some
other beverages. The children of this country
drink about as much Coca-Cola as milk. A
six-ounce bottle of Coca-Cola is sold for 7
cents, or 46 cents a quart. And what is if?
If is water aerated with carbonic acid gas, and
containing certain ingredients te give it flavour.
It is backed by a terrific and constant advertising campaign in the American and Canadian
press. Almnost any place you look you see
advertisemenfs of Coca-Cola, and people believe if is s0 good that they pay 46 cents a
quart for if--30 cents more than the cosf of
milk. Then let us consider beer. The 22-ounce
bottie of beer, which is sometimes referred to
as a quart, costs 35 cents.* That figures ouf
at 63 cents a quart, or 45 cents more than the
price of a quart of milk. Millions of dollars'
worth of beer is sold in evcry province. The
value of the liquor sold in Nova Scotia a year
ago amounfed f0 $23 million.
Hon. Mr. HARDY: Good 1
Hon.. Mr. KINLEY: On thaf there was $8
million profit. Yet we are told that our people
are too poor to buy butter. It just does nof
add up. If is a question not of the high cost
of living, but of the cost of high living. Do
not forget that Coca-Cola has a patented
right in Canada, and no other company can
make ifs product. No such liberty as my
friend wants for margarine manufacturers is
given f0 other companies.
Hon. Mr. EULER: But a lot of other
drinks are made in competition with CocaCola.
Hon. Mr. KINLEY: They are not called
Coca-Cola. There have been some famous
Iawsuits between the makers of Pepsi-Cola
and Coca-Cola company.
Hon. Mr. McLEAN: And Pepsi-Cola won
out.
Hon. Mr. KINLEY: When the result is
analysed, I fhink they both won.
Hon. Mr. QUINN: They both lost.
Hon. Mr. KINLEY: When the people of
our country complain about the high cosf of
living there is nof much thaf one can say in
reply; but they always forgef f0 tell about
the fact that their income fax this year bas
been reduced. For instance, t he fax for a man
witliouf children who gef s $2,000 in about $100

383

less this year than it was last year. We hope
that when the budget comes down the tax
will be reduced~ still furfher.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. KINLEY: By reason of income
fax reductions the situation foday is good in
spite of the higher cosf of living. Further,
we must nof forget that a beneficent government has established a sysfemn of family
allowances in this country, by means of which
large families are greatly assisted. If is meant
f0 help families such as my honourable friend
from Toronfo-Trinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck)
referred -Io. We supported thaf legislaf ion
becauec we wanted f0 provide for such
families.
Hon.. Mr. HORNER: Ask the legal men
what protection they have through their law
societies.

Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: None.
Hon. Mr. KINLEY: I do flot liT<e f0 clash
wifh members of the legal profession, because
in our complex economy of today one has to
appeal f0 them very offen. I feel thaf if is
better f0 find ouf what they know, and say
very lit fIe about if.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Oh, oh!
Hon. Mr. KINLEY: Personally, I do nof
know much about oleomargarine, but I do
know about sorne things. I was amused at
the way in which my honour8ble friend (Hon.
Mr. Euler) approached this subjecf. Two years
ago he said oleomargarine was a good substifute for butter; last year if was as good
as butter; this year if is better than buffer.
Hon. Mr. DUFFUS: If is going up.
Hon. Mr. KINLEY: I suppose my friend
feels good about the American agitation thaf
is rampant at the present time. He taîks about
pressure. I have some advertising material
before me, and as one interested in advertising
if strikes me that if is part of the most
intelligent and subtle adverfising program I
have seen in many a day. I have in my hand
an adverfisenîient appearing in the McCall's
magazine which reads:
EAsY To Cocuia! Smooth-spreading Allsweef
cornes to, you white. To tint if yellow for fable
use an exclusive easier-opening packef of pure
colouring is provided with each pound.
N_\ow why do they advertise in that way?
If is because the law for the protection of the
people in many of the states prohibits the
colouring of margarine. These advertisers
say, in effecf. "We cannot colour if, but you

restaurant and hotelkeepers to colour it before serving it.
Is not everything
Hon. Mr. LACASSE:
more or less coloured nowadays?
Hon. Mr. KINLEY: Here is another
advertisement:
NUTRITIONALLY RIon. You can depend on the
vit.amin A in Nucoa. Winter and summer, every
pound is guaranteed to contain at least 15,000
U.S.P. units. Cook with Nucoa as it comespure white. It bas its full food value in this
form. For pretty table serving, you can easily
tint Nucoa a delicate yellow with the pure
colour wafer inserted in each package.
Naw if this product is so good, why not let
it stand on its own merit? Why not colour
it green or red so that it will be distinctive
and not look like butter? Colouring it yellow
is a mean scheme for the purpose of trying to
sell one product on the merits of another. It
is that device that the people complain about.
The whole thing has brought forth a barrage
of advertisements in the United States to
overcome the fact that oleomargarine must be
coloured.
A further advertisement reads:
You get margarine white-you want it yellow.
We know it would certainly save you time and
bother if you didn't have to mix in the colour
yourself.
That is pretty subtle.
It would be a simple matter for manufacturers
to colour margarine yellow when it is made-at
no extra cost to you.
They appeal first by the suggestion that it
would save you time, and secondly that it
would look like butter.
Hon. Mr. EULER: What has this to do with
the bill?
Hon. Mr. KINLEY: The advertisement
continues:
But you have seen how discriminatory taxes
and licence fees would run the cost of coloured
margarine much higher to you. And 23 states
prohibit the sale of coloured margarine.
Hon. Mr. QUINN: New Jersey lifted the
ban just last week.
Hon. Mr. KINLEY: New Jersey is the city
of New York.

The map I have in my hand shows in yellow
the states which permit the sale of coloured
margarine. The taxes, licences and prohibitions
on this substance in the United States are so
terrifie today that the manufacturers are
taking advantage of a moment of scarcity to
present a barrage of advertisements to get
over this colour problem and make their
product look like butter. We are told that it
is as good as butter. They say that a few
years ago it was not as good, but now they
put in artificial vitamins-15,000 units of
vitamin A per pound-and they use 21 per
cent skim milk to make a high quality product.
This is what one advertisement says:
Its flavour is so delicate. so natural. It comes
from the cultured pasteurized skim milk used in
its careful making. You'll agree . . . there's
nothing artificial about Allsweet's flavour.
In some of the advertisements they refer to
the milk as "non-fat milk". They do not like
the term "skim milk"; it does not sound as
well. As a matter of fact, they use 21 per
cent skim milk to get the flavour of butter.
In the other house Mr. Sinclair, the member for Vancouver, in referring to the cost
of margarine quoted from a pamphlet published by the dairy authorities. I will read
from his quotation.
Margarine may .be coloured by the same dye as
is used for colouring butter.
Nobody cares about colouring butter today.
It was done by some woman in the country
who had poor looking white butter and used
turmeric or something of that nature to give
it a bit of colour. No self-respecting person
would put colouring in butter today.
The quotation continues:
A good margarine contains 16-5 per cent skim
milkMy information is that it is 21 per cent.
-for flavour and texture, plus minute amounts
of glycerin derivative to prevent spattering in
frying, and some lecithin to prevent burniog and
sticking to the pan.
It reminds me of a man with diabetes. You
can, with insulin, make him function, and
function well. Insulin was a great discovery,
and it is very helpful to the patient if the dose
is not too large. But I prefer the man who
can function without medication. Butter contains in itself all the vitamins; it requires no
medication; it can function on its own account,
without a mixture. Therefore, I say, to compare margarine with butter as a food is to beg
the question, and arguments of this kind must
come from people who have an interest in what
they are trying to put over.
The other day an honourable senator quoted
from an anonymous editorial from a medical
magazine. Another senator asked him who

APRIL 27, 1948
wrote it, and lie could not tell. Yet we in this
chamber are invited to accept it as an authority.
Hon. Mr. LAÇASSE: May I point out to my
honourable friend, by way of comparison, that
we regard with sorte respect the authority of
the Law Journal as the mouthpiece of the
Canadian Bar Association.
Hon. Mr. KINLEY: Wlien you are producing evidence you are supposed to have
something a littie more definite than an anonymous staternent.
Hon. Mr. QUINN: My honourable friend
quoted from the Halifax Chronicle. Can lie
say who wrote the article?
Hon. Mr. KINLEY: Yes, I think I could.
Hon. Mr. LACASSE: Perhaps le honourable gentleman wrote it hinseif.
Hon. Mr. KINLEY: In Michigan the use of
margarine was permitted only in penal institutions. Now tliey want it in schools.
Hon. Mr. EULER: Hospitals.
Hon. Mr. KINLEY: Up to now they have
limited its use. The agitation for its use lias
brought to liglit ini the United States many
things which the public did not know. My
honourable friend tells us that no country in
the world but Canada prohibits the use of
margarine. Let me point out to him that it
was not the people of the United States wlio
decided that margarine should be sold in that
country; it was the Supreme Court of the
United States, whicli, by reason of its constitutional powers can overrîde the laws of
individual States of the American Union.
,Hon. Mr. MêLEAN: The States can change
the constitution.
Hon. Mr. KINLEY: Another honourable
eenator lias said, "I arn in favour of margarine
because I arn against rnonopoly." Well, I amn
against margarine for the saine reason. I do
nlot know wbat monopoly there is in the sale
of butter, except the rnonopoly of the cow in
giving the best food in the world. 1 believe the
cow is the cheapest factory there is.
How is butter made? It is made on the
individual farmi by the farmer's wife, and in
the creameries of this country, in every littie
town from Vancouver to Halifax. In almost
every community one finda a creamery whicli
is a part of the economnic life of that community, a central market to which the farmer
can bring bis cream. While I arn not against
big business as such, if I had to make a
choice I would choose the little fellows, these
smaîl producers who are distributed aIl over
Canada.
Last week we got a gale of wind from the
M.gritimes about the decentralization of

industry, in relation to the freiglit rates report.
We were told that industry must be decentralized, and with tliat I agree. But making
margarine will not decentralize industry. If
you permit the manufacture of margarine, it
will be made by Canada Packers and a few
other large corporations. The product will be
tremendously advertised; people will be led
to believe that if they do nlot eat margarine
they cannot keep alive; every store in tlie
country will be stocked with it, and the farmer will suifer thereby.
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: May I ask the
lionourable senator a question which I intended
to put to him a little earlier? As lie did flot
return to the subi ect I should like to ask it
now. If the withdrawal of the ban on oleomargarine were necessary to enable Canada to
obtain the advantages of the Geneva treaties,
would lie favour witlidrawal of the ban?
Hon. Mr. KINLEY: That question is pretty
liard to answer. Legal autliorities of the
Government of Canada tell me that the treaty
centaine no suai provision. I have read it,
and it is my conclusion, according to the best
of my judgment, tbat tliey are right in that
statement.
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: This may lielp to
clear my honourable friend's mi. I have
no douit that lie was present at the Canadian
Trade Relations Committee the other morningHon. Mr. KINLEY: Yes.
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: -when those who
were present in Geneva and negotiated these
treaties gave evidence. Unless I arn mistaken,
they made it very clear that witliout the
withdrawal of the ban on margarine we cannot enjoy thie benefits of the Geneva treaties.
Hon. Mr. KINLEY: I think the items were
quoted out of their context, in the first place;
and in the second place, whatever they said
the first time tliey revoked at the second
meeting. I will appeal to the chairman.
Hon. Mr. EULER: I cannot agree with you.
Hon. Mr. KINLEY: Tien we shaîl have to
fali back on the announcement of Riglit Hon.
Mr. St. Laurent, and I will let the matter
rest tbere.
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: If I may add a ivord
on this point, tlie Minister of External Affaire,
in lis statement to the other house, simply said
that in lis opinion, at least, the provisions mn
the Geneva treaty as far as oleomargarine was
concerned were not retroactive. I do not think
lie maintained, for a moment that the treaties
were not arrived at in the way I have stated.

SENATE

Hon. Mr. KINLEY: I think wbat the
minister said was perfectly clear. He said ini
effeet, "Get it out of your minds; it does flot
affect you."ý-and, that is what I arn doing.
My bonourable friends who favour this bill
seem to be very persistent in their questioning.
I have no objection to that, for I arn an old
hand; 1 have been through it, rany times.
I repeat that 1 arn against monopolies, and
I do not believe that the power of money and
industrial organizations should be used to the
detriment of the primary producers of this
country.
Hon. Mr. DUFF: Hear, hear. I quite agree.
Hon. Mr. KINLEY: The other day the
butter situation was .used to buttress arguments. It was said that a firm made profits of
baif a million dollars in a montb on butter.
That saine firm want the manufacture of oleomargarine to be legalized. What would tbeY
do if they were able to make it? They would
not bave to buy it frorn the fariner; they
would make it tbemselves and, being astute
businessmen, would use it for purposes of
greater profit.
Something bas been said about advertising.
Did you ever sec butter advertised by anybody? Nobody advertises butter. Nobody
who makes it bas money enough to advertise it.
Hon. Mr. CAMPBELL: Tbey do not bave
to advertise butter. because you cannot boy
anything else.
Hon. Mr. KINLEY: You can do without it,
and if you do not want a thing that is wliat
you do.
Hon. Mr. EULER: That is what people
have to do.
Hon. Mr. KINLEY: Furthermore, the littie
creameries wbîch. operate on a co-operative
basis return their profits to the farmer; tbey
have no money to epend in advertising butter.
Somebody bas said that butter is made only
by -tbe fellow in the back concessions. Admittedly bis buying power is not very bigh.
1 used to send milk to the local dairy, but
when the dairy bad -an over-supply our milk
was returned. So, as I did not wish to be in
competition with the local farmers, I directed
that the milk be sent to the creamery to be
made into butter.
The marketing of butter is largely a matter
of transportation. The farmer who lives near
the city can sell bis milk as sucb, but tbose
wbo live a long distance away bave to put
their mitk into the production of butter. It
is not correct to say that the farmer wbose
milk goes into butter has to take a great loss.
He stili bas tbe skimi milk, and bie does not
bave the cost of deIivering bis milk to market.

Wben these facts are considered there is not
sucb a vast difference in the retuî'n as bas
been suggested.
Farmers bave no monopoly on fats in tbis
country, over haif of tbem being produced in
Canada by tbe big industries. Crisco is made
from. vegetable oil; Mazota is a corn oul, and
shortening is a mixture of fats and cils. In
the interests of our farmi export trade many
farmers are obliged to produce bacon bogs,
and tbey do not get any fat fromi these
animais.
Somebody bas said tbat fats and
ois for tbe manufacture of margarine can be
produced in Canada.
Hon. Mr. EULER: So tbey can.
Hon. Mr. KINLEY: Tbey speak about sunflower oil. Only a smaît amount of that où is
produced in Canada, and it is wortb 38 cents a
pound.
Hon. Mr. EULER:
United States.

Tbey use it in the

Hon. Mr. KINLEY: Furtbermore, you cannot keep prices down and expeet big supplies.
The bonourable senator from Lunenburg
(Hon. Mr. Duif) and myseîf bad a friend who
wvas going into the sailing business. I was
reconditioning and outfitting three ships for
him. We arranged that hie would establish
a trade in Lunenburg and land bis products
there if bie could get supplies and ship a crew.
He went to sea and secured a cargo of oul.
When bie went to St. John's, Newfoundland,
he found tbat bie could get 10 cents a pound
more for the oul than bie couId get in Canada.
This meant a difference of $30,000 or S40,000,
and it was but natural for him to want the
highest price bie could secure. But bie did not
get it. He brought bis oit to Canada, where
lie got 13 cents instead of 21 cents a pound.
Canada got the benefit of that deal; yet you
say the Iaws of this country curtait liberty.
The price ceiling was imposed for the benefit
of Canadians, in order to keep prices w ithin a
certain range.
Honourable senators. I bave said that tbe
farmer bas no monopoly, and I maintain that
argument. He must share tbe markets of this
country with others. Up to a year ago the
farmer bad the lowest income of anybody in
Canada. We ail know that in tbe economy
of tbis country prosperity stops at tbe farmer*s door. If the farm is not successful lie
cannot buy the goods that I, for instance,
manufacture in my plant, and thus the men
who are employed by me will soon lose thieir
wages. Therefore, if the passage of this bill
means that, my plant workers will benefit, it
will be only for a short time.
Wben my bonourable friends are cornered
on the question of the importation of oit into

APRIL 27, 1948

Canada they say, "Are you nlot in favour of
manufacturing it in Canada?" But the bill
does nlot provide for that. We must deai with
the bill as it reads. If the honourable senator
who introduced this bill states that we should
manufacture oil in Canada, 'he shouid change
his bill. because it is ail-inclusive. Those
who want this bill know that they canflot
produce rnuch margarine within the next few
years because they cannot get the ois and fats.
They know also that this is an opportune
tirne to get a foot in the door, so that should
a depression corne they will have the opportunity, which they had before the war, of hringing in tank steamers filled with cocoanut, palm
and peanut ails from. the Orient to compete
against the farmers wbo produce oiîs in this
country.
Hon. Mr. DAVIDJ: What about Russian ail?

Han. Mr. KINLEY: I may tell my honourable friend that the Canadian Chamber of
Commerce started out quite enthusiastically
and sent questionnaires aIl aver the country.
They asked the various Boards of Trade to vote
for the lifting of the ban on margarine and to
present a petition to the gaverfiment. But it
was not long before they found that they
icould nat get the necessary support.

Hon. Mr. KINLEY: Honourable senatars,
I ar n ft in favour of putting the Canadian
farmer into campetitian. with the naked
OrientaIs, who run up cacoanut trees, pull
down cocoanuts, press out the oul and seli
it to this country. Their wages and standard
of living are low, and we cannot let aur farmers
compete with that sort of labour. The people
of Canada rnay think they are getting samething a littie cheaper by buying oleomargarine;
but it is my opinion that the ultimate effect of
this wilI be detrirnental ta the econorny of
Canada. I think that in this time of crisis we
can afford, as the mariner says, to "«hold a
turn" and let well enough alone. In other
words. we shauld not pass legislation because
of an exigency-legislation which we will be
sorry for in days to corne.
I would rernind those who are in faveur of
free enterprise that the farmer is the greatest
individualist in this cauntry. If that individualisrn is destroyed and we give way to the
greed of the big manufacturers, free enterprise,
of which the farmer is the backbone, wili be
lost in Canada.

Hon. Mr. KINLEY: We import butter
into Nova Scotia. We do not produce as
rnuch as we should.
My honourable friend (Hon. Mr. Euler)
talked -about liberty. It seems to me that
liberty in vacuo does not mean very much.
What is one man's liberty is another man's
prohibition. A man who wants economie "go
as you please" is dreaming, not thinking. We
Iive in a day of strange ecanomies. For
instance, the automobile industry raised a
row because we in Canada imported secondhand automobiles. As a consequence we were
prohibited from importing them. That too
is covered by an item in the schedule of
the Custorns Act, which I referred to a while
ago.

Hon. Mr. QUINN: Is flot the Lunenburg
Board of Trade on record as being in favour
of lifting the ban on margarine?
Hon. Mr. KINLEY: I have mentioned that
Lunenbiurg is a highly industrialized place.
We have 200 men in our awn plant. I was
present when the vote was taken, and I
know they had a rnajarity of about four and
that twenty-five did flot vote. I ar nflt surprised that they voted for the lifting of the
ban; but Bridgewater and other towns within
the district did flot do so.
Hon. Mr. EULER: The majority of the
Boards of Trade in Nova Scotia voted for it.

Hon. Mr. KINLEY: This bill is to import.
There are 140 million people in the United
States, and if they shipped their secondhand automobiles into Canada our -automobile business would be destroyed.
In the last few years we have put prohibitions on ail kinds of things. Money is the
potential life-blood of a nation, yet we have
prohibited aur people from spending their
rnoney as and when they wauld. If it is not
Liberalism to protect the country's economic
weifare in the interests of people as a wh.ole
and with a view to preserving our national
prosperîty and stability, I do flot know anything about Liberalism. And if it is against
Liberalism to support a worthy cause that
needs assistance, that is news to me. I believe
that it is the government's duty to preserve
national stability, ta give assistance ta
worthy causes that require it, to protect the

SENATE

masses-and it seems to, me that the present
government has been performing that duty
very well. I arn of the opinion that, i11 the
truest interests of the masses, the prohibition
on margarine should be continued at present.
We have heard speeches in support of the
bill by some of our honourable friends of the
legal profession.
These gentlemen make a
very subtie approaeh and employ a good deal
of technique. They ask, "Would you be in
favour of this or that?" If you are flot on
guard they may break down the outer ramparts of your defences, and the danger is that
when that happens the inner fortress will not
withstand much pressure. We need ta be
careful when they speak to us in their nice
phrases.
The present law has been on the statute
books of this country for twenty years, in which
time it has withstood msny assaults. For a
good many of those years the sponsor of this
bill (Hon. Mr. Euler) was a member of the
govemnment, as was the senator from Churchill
(Hon. Mr. Crerar). In response to a question
here the other day the senator from Churchill
said that during his terma of office as a minister
of the Crown he was against the prohibition
on margarine. Well, ail I have to say to him
and to the sponsor of the bill is that if they
were against the present law they "dwelt
in the tents of sin" for a long time.

The motion was agreed to.

DAIRY INDUSTRY BILL
8ECOND READING
The Senate resumed from yesterday the
adjourned debate on the motion of Hon. Mr.
Eul'r for the second reading of Bill B, an Act
to, amend the Dairy Industry Act.
Hon. WISHIART McL. ROBERTSON:
Honourable senators, as has been stated a
number of times, this is the third successive
session in which this bull has been before the
Senate. I did flot take part in the debate last
session, for 1 was absent fromn the house at
that time, but in 1946 1 spoke immediately
after the sponsor of the bill (Hon. Mr. Euler)
had moved second reading. My reason for
doing so was that it had been rumoured that
the government had something to do with the
introduction of the bill. Perhaps that idea
arose because in those days I had the honour
of bavîng the sponsor of the bill as my deskmate, and some peopie may have suspected
that there was collusion between us. I remcmber distinctly that later in that debate the
honourable gentleman from Leeds (Hon. Mr.
Hardy) took me to task for, as he put it,
"sounding the tocsin". I had no such idea or
intention, and being then new to the office of
government leader I was quite embarrassed st
the charge. I have since learned that my
honourable friend's bark is worse than his bite,
and consequently I shaîl risk agaîn making a
few observations on this measure. This time,
though, I am taking the precaution of speak-

SENA'rE
ing towards the end of the debate, so that
%vhat1 say will flot unduly affect anyone, one
xvay or the other.
Honourable senators, I propose taking
exactly the saine stand as I took before. In
1946 1 made three statements. First, I said
1 considered the debate more or less academnie
because, owing to the world shortage of fats
and ojîs, I did flot think margarine could be
mnade available in Canada for some time to
corne, even if the ban were lifted. Secondly,
1 said I was afraid that the lifting of the ban
would be prejudicial to the dairy industry, or
at least to that part of it in the province from.
which I corne, the only province as to which
I cou-Id profess any knowledge. Thirdly, I said
1 did not think it necessary to deal with the
oleomargarine question as a matter of normal
policy. On that point I should like to make
a few additional observations today.
For the convenience of honourable senators
and so that I may deal with the subjeet as
briefly as possible. I propose to put three
questions which I shaHliv
tryo answver.
My first question is: Should the Senate pass
this bill, will the consumers of Canada then be
able to get margarine in addition to the butter,
shortening and other foods containing fats and
oils which they are getting now? My second
question is: Why not pass this bill, even if we
cannot get margarine for the next three years
or more? Could il (10 ans' harii? Mv third
question is: IIow can the controversy over
margarine be settled in a reasonable and constructive way, acceptable to both the dairy
farmers and the consuming public?
With
reference to the third question I would say
that I do not believe it possible, in view of
the controvorsy that has taken place on Ibis
subjeet, to resolvo the problem in a way which
would be fully acceptable to
everyone.»
Since tbis matter was first introduced in the
bouse I have listened to some most excellent
speeches. Whatever view I beld whien it was
first introduced, and have beld fromi lime to
time since, I have very nearly been swaycd
by those whio held different views. I have read
everything available on the subj oct and hiave
endeavoured to keep an open mind with
respect 10 the controversv. I represent. as
does îny honourable friend from BedfordHalifax (Hon. Mr. Quinn). a population wbichi
could more properly be regarded sa being coinposed of consumers than.of producers. I came
to this bouse without any particular conviction
on tbe subjeet one way or the other, and I do
flot know that whiat 1 have t0 say this afternoon will be generally accepted either by the
proponents or the opponents of the bill. However, I arn giving my own view, as I did on a

previous occasion, and am flot announcing any
gov erniment policy.

Whien I spoke in this house in 1946, 1 gave
certain information with respect to, Canada's
fats and oils situation and ber responsibilities
and limitations in the circumstances. I believe

tbat in Ibis respect Canada's position today
is unchanged, or possibly a bit worse.

My view in 1946 was that the debate was
an academie discussion as to wbat policy we

should adopt some two or three years bence.
From the information wbich I shaîl supply to

the bouse Ibis afternoon I shaîl endeavour
to show that bad the Senate passed the bill in

1946 Canada now would eitber have no mar-

garine or, if she did bave it, would bave il at
the sacrifice of some otber foods. Moreover, I
believe tbat tbat will be tbe condition in the
immediate forsecable future.

The total world export of fats and oils available during 1947 for countries requiring tbem,

of wbich Canada is a conspicuous example,
amounted 10 3-6 million tons as against a pre-

war normal quantity of 5-9 million tons. The
International Emergency Food Council-of
wbich we became a member for the purpose of
assuring ourselves as far as possible of our
share of importations of fats and oils, on wbich

we are beavily dependent-bas made a report
on the situation and wben it is likely to improve. I should like 10 give three quotations
from that report.
It is entitled "Report on fats and oils. Current situation and furtber outlook in world
supplies and distribution of oilseeds, fats and
oils," and is dated Washington, September,
1947. Il states in part, page 22:
supplies,
: . . there seems little doubt that %world
in relation to the dem.and for fats, wi]l present
greater difficulties during 1948 than bave yet
beeil experienced during the post-war period.
The British goveriment, at the request of
the I.E.F.C., and indeed, as a general policy,
as hionourable senators may recaîl, bas undertaken a very ambitious long-lerm program, 10
increase the production of edible oils in East
Africa. In publishing their plan, they state:
Althougb the present acute phase may have
passe(l in four or five years, it is the view of
those hest able to judge that there will be a
continuing world sh-ortage of fats and ols for a
long time, say, for the next ten t0 twenty years.
I take a further quotation from. the report,
page 27:
Everytbing, therefore, points to the necessity
of aIl countries redoubling their efforts to restore or further increase production of oilseeds,
fats and oils in respect botb to tbe immediate
future and 10 the period well beyond 1950.
I give these quotations te support my statenment that there is no appreciable increase in
the production of fats over that which obtained
in 1946, wlien I prex iously spoke on this
question.

APRIL 28, 1948
As many honourable senators who were in
parliament before I was will remember, this
situation is nlot of recent developm-ent. In 1942
Canada, as well as a numnber of other Allied
countries, joined' the Combined Food Board to
arrange for the bulk purchase andý equitable
allocation of scarce foodstuifs, ineluding fats
and ouas. In June, 1946, following the war. this
organization was enlarged. and becamne the
International Ernergency Food Council. On
January 1, 1948, the council was replaced by
the International Emergency Food Committee
of the Food and Agrieultural Organi.zation of
the United Nations. International control of
fats and oils is now vested in the Flats and
Qîls Committee of this organization. Canada
is one of the twenty-five mnember countries,
which include almost aIl the important producers and importers of fats and ols. After
the war, mnembership was thrown open to any
country that wished to join and would accept
the responsibilities of mernbership. The countries which now helong to this organization are:
Australia, Austria, Belgiu*m, Brazil, Canada,
China, Czechoslovakia, Denmnark, Finland,
France, India, Italy, Mexico, Netherlands,
Norway, Pakistan, Poland, Portugal, the
Philippines, Switzerland, Sweden, Siam, South
Afiea, the United States, and the United
Kingdorn.
Canada joined this organization because
she is one of the heaviest importers of fats
and oiîs. One-third to one-haif of lier consumption is imported. Perhaps this fact is
not as generally recognized in this country
as it might he. We are gîven to thinking of
Canada as a major producer of foods, a
country which not only produces for its oýwn
consumption but has an exportable surplus,
and it may corne to some people as a shock
to learn that we have always been heavy
importers of fats and oils. That condition
is not one that bas arisen since the war; it
existed in 1938. 0f various forma of edible
oiîs--that is, exclusive of butter-we import
far more than we produce; we have always
done so; and wben -the question arose of
securing a fair share of these products, it was
obviously to our advantage to join the
organization. One group of member countries
consists of those who not only produce
sufficient for their own requirements but have
a substantial export surplus. The United
States, I arn advîsed, produces sufficient oils
to takre care of its own requirements. Canada
as I have said, is and aIways bas been one
of the heaviest importera of oils.
The international Food Council hbas available to it the fats and oils supplies of the
entire world, excepting only one or two

countries-Argentina for instance-and it
allocatea to each country its fair share of
what is available. The allocations by percentages vary a little, the formula having been
designed to give importing countries about
75 per cent of pre war utilization on a per
capita basis. By that I mean that the objective is to provide an amount equivalent to
about 75 per cent of pre-war consumption
per capita. The aimi of importing countries
was to be assured of 75 per -cent of their prewar supplies, including both dornestic production and imports. Importing countries got
75 per cent and exporting countries about 85
per cent, with certain exceptions. For
example, the quota of the United States is
based on about 95 per cent of that country's
pre-war supplies. Canada's quota is slightly
less, between 85 to 90 per cent, althougli
I am advised that if our dornestic production
la taken into consideration the allocation is
higher than that of any other country whieh
dependa on imports. Needless ýto say the
allowance for such countries as Germany and
Japan and for parts of continental Europe,
is very much less.
Hon. Mr. PATERSON: May I ask the
honourable senator whether ail these countries
are not permitted to import margarine?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I think the principle on which allocations were applîed was
mucli the sanie as that which we adopted with
respect to wage controls. The point was then
raised that "if you are going to freeze wages,
you will freeze themn on ail sorts of diff erent
levels". It was assumed that ecd country
should receive its proportion of fats and ouas
in the fox m to which it had been accuatomed.
If the honourable senator is askîng whether
the oils allocated to us could ha received substitutionally in the forrn of margarine, I would
say that that would ha permissible, but the
total allocation of oils would thereby ha
reduced. But I will return to that matter a
little later. Ahl I will say now ia that we
could ha allocated margarine if somebody
wanted to supply it, but it would ha daducted
from. our quota, it would not be an addition
to it.
Let me now deal with our allocations, our
production and consumption. My figures ara
not in aIl cases exact, but they are informed
estimatea. There is some littie difflculty about
determining exactly what waa the amount of
our dornestic production in 1938, but I arn certain that my information is reasonably exact.
Compared with the pre-war period, Canada's
situation is roughly as follows: Butter production is about the saine as it was ini 1938,

SENATE

the actual production in that year being 358
million pounds and the estimated production
for 1948 being 362 million pounds. Production of other fats and oils from domestic
sources was about 250 million pounds in 1938
and, according to estimates, will be about 300
million pounds this year. Our imports in 1938
were 268 million pounds; for this year they
are estimated at 187 million pounds. But
the 1948 figure is on the optimistic side,
both in relation to production and to imports.
In order to clear up a point, I should like
to explain that when the combined Food
Board was set up, Newfoundland-which was
not named in the list of countries I have
given-was included with Canada for administration purposes. Out of the proposed figure
for 1948 of 187 million pounds, 9 million
pounds are set aside for Newfoundland. We
have asked for 187 million pounds, but up to
the present time have only been allocated 172
million and it is questionable whether we will
get what we have asked for. I understand that
at the present time negotiations are being carried on to have Newfoundland supplied with oils
by Britain instead of Canada. However, if
that should come about it would simply mean
that our quota would be reduced accordingly.
Our estimated 1948 production of all domestic
fats and oils is 300 million pounds, but it is
doubtful whether we will get that quantity. I
have been advised by the Wartime Prices and
Trade Board that their estimate of our domestic production in 1948 is lower than our actual
production in 1947. Whether it actually will
be lower or not I cannot say.
Our 1948 supplies of fats and oils from all
sources will be short some 40 to 60 million
pounds, physically, of the 1938 supply. At the
same time it is estimated that the mouths to
be fed in this country have increased from
11,100,000 to 12,600,000, an increase of 1,500,000.
The following figures show the composition
of our tentative allocation of imported fats
and oils for 1948. The allocated amounts of
oils, which are given in metric tons and which
I have changed into pounds, are as follows:
Liquid edible oils ................
Cocoanut oil ....................
Hard and semi-hard oils ........
M arine oils ....................

Pounds
48,488,000
50,692,000
31,460,000
33,000,000

Included in the marine oil figure is approximately 25,000,000 pounds of whale and fish oil,
which is imported from Norway, one of the
main sources of supply. Where the other
8,000,000 pounds of marine oils come from I
have no particular knowledge. The amount

of castor oil is 5,500,000 pounds; olive oil,
2,860,000 pounds. Perhaps I did not make
myself clear that w.hen dealing with fats and
oils I include inedible as well as edible oils. An
inedible oil is an oil of the type that might be
used in soap and paint manufacturing. There
is a border line between these two, and some
oils, such as linseed oil, are used only in the
manufacture of paint and are not edible. The
honourable senator from Waterloo wil1 correct
me if I am wrong but I understand that Lever
Brothers, the soap people, and allied industries and the paint people, are margarine
manufacturers in the United States. Our 1948
domestic production, is estimated roughly as
follows: linseed oit, 100 million pounds; lard,
40 million pounds; tal-low and grease, 100
million pounds; fish oils, 20 million pounds;
corn oils, 10 million pounds; soy bean oil, 9
million pounds; sunflower seed oil, 6 million
pounds, and rapeseed and other items which
are not enumerated, 10 million pounds-a total
of 295 million pounds. This figure compares
with a pre-war production of these same fats
and oils of 250 million pounds. That is the
best information I can get on this point.
Largely owing to the development of vegetable
oils and oil seeds, our domestie production has
increased over that of pre-war years, but the
estimated 1948 output will actually be less
than that of 1947. Despite our increase in
population, our total supply of fats and oils
from both domestic and imported sourcesalthough it is not quite as good as that of the
United States-gives us a favourable per
capita consumption as compared with any
other importing nation. Having secured oils.
both those of an indigenous and of imported
nature, what do we do? To secure proper
allocation. the whole operation is left in the
hands of the Wartime Prices and Trade Board.
The board allocates the combined supplies to
the different industries, roughly as follows:
food industries, including the shortening industry and the approximately 3,000 bakeries in
Canada, receive 180 million pounds; the soap
industries receive 145 million pounds, and the
paint industries receive 65,000,000 pounds.
Sixty million pounds are allocated to lard,
linseed oil and corn oil retailers, while
40,000,000 pounds go to other industrial users.
I should like to explain how the Wartime
Prices and Trade Board undertook to allocate
these supplies, but first I should point out that
I am advised by the Fats and Oils Administrator that the twenty-five countries, including
Canada, have scrupulously lived up to their
obligations.
An Hon. SENATOR: Hear, hear.

APRIL 28, 1948

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON:
Each of these
countries, having been allocated so mueh for
its various purposes, protects and keeps for its
respective nationals within its boundaries the
amount which it produces a.nd importB. This
is done almost entirely by the issuance of
export permits, which is the method adopted
in practieally every country. Canada as well
as some other countries for some turne used a
rationing system for certain items. The only
maj or exception to the system of issuing permits is to be found in the relationship hetween
Canada and the United States.
Honourable senators are aware that, following
the Hyde Park agreement, the United States
has never regulated the shipinent of commodities to Canada by export permits. It will bie
recalled that last year there was quite a commotion ia congress over the large quantity of
fuel oil being shipped to this country, and it
was suggested that export permits be required.
But the State Department did not concur in
this, because there was an understanding
between the two governments. and pointed
out that in such circumstances it was for
Canada to control imports, if necessary, rather
than for the United States to control exports
to Canada. When the relation betwieen the
two countries was explained to me, I wished
to make doubly sure of it before I passed on
the information to the Senate. So I wrote to
my colleague, Mr. Abhott, the Minister of
Finance, asking specific questions in order
that 1 miglit get the facts to place on our
records. Under date of March 3, 1948, Mr.
Abbott wrote me as follows:
My dear Colleague:
1 have your latter of February 13 respecting
the supplies of cils and fats as they pertain to
the manufactu-re of oleomargarine la Canada.
Canada is a member of the Fats and Cils
Committee, International Emergency Food Council, and is allocated fats and oils (both edible
and inedible) fromn the world's exportable
suppIy.
Lt is indicated that the world supply of fats
and cils, while improving, stili remains short of
reurmns
and it -would appear very difficult,
if not impossible, for us to obtain additional
supplies of edible cils suitable for the manufacture of margarine through the International
Emergency Food Council. However, it has been
indicated to 'us that we might be able to supplement our supply of fats and cils in 1948 outside
of the International Emergency Food Council
by arranging a quid pro quo for grain -and grain
products with certain countries which might
direct supplies of fatty conimodities to Canada
in order to obtain cereals and their products.
In order that there may be no misunderstanding, I might explain that that does not
refer to any increased amount over our target
quota of 187 million pounds. It is merely a
suggestion that if the I.E.F.C.,,because of the

393

fact that it does not control ahl the world's
fats, were able to give us only 172 million
pounds, it is possible that we could bring
the amount up to 187 million pounds by bartering grain.
The letter continues:
In se far as the prohibition of the importation
of margarine froin the United States is concerned, we would be bound to prohibitI hope honourable senators will take note
of this.
-the importation by ýreason of our undertaking
both with the United States Department of
Agriculture and the International Emergency
Food Council to adhere to our I.E.F.C. quota.
The United States has neyer required expert
permits with respect to fats and cils consîgned
to Canada (al.though permits are required for
ail other destinations) since the officiaIs concerned are satisfied that Canada recognizes the
I.E.F.C. allocation, and has neyer abused the
regulations.
I do not believe that the board would bie prepared to reallocate supplies of edible cils and
fats for non-established purposes. Any reallocatien of fats and cils must naturally bie at the
expense of the shortening and edible fat consuming industries.
That last paragraph refers to a matter of
which I shahl speak later, the question of
what we should do in this country if the ban
on oleomargarine were removed. From our
domestic and imported supplies we could, if
we thought it wise, take away a certain
quantity for use in the manufacture of oleomargarine. AIl that the minister says is that
hae does not think the board would agree to
that policy.
I have endeavoured as far as I can to
explain the international set-up. At the moment I arn not arguing for or against it; I am
simply rarninding honourable members of a
situation that has existed sînce long before
I became a member of this house, a situation with which. most honourable members
are parhaps more familiar than I am.
Now I want to deal with the question of
where the margarine would corne from if the
ban were lifted, assurning we stayed in this
international set-up and lived up to it, and that
the general world supply of fats and oil
remained as it is. The first suggested source
-this is referred to in the last paragraph of
Mr. Abbott's letter-is a diversion of some
ols and fats froin bakeries and other foodproducing industries for the purpose of making margarine. This question has no bearing
on the international allocation. It is, I think,
the point brought up by the honourable senator from. Thunder Bay (Hon. Mr. Paterson).
We have these fats and oils; they are ours;
what we do with them. is our own business.

SENATE

Let us assume that there have been allocated
to us under this set-up 180 million pounds for
the shortening and baking industries of this
country. Across this country from the Atlantic
to the Pacifie there are some 3,000 bakeries.
They and the shortening manufacturers of the
country get the 180 million pounds. It would
be possible, if considered advisable, to take,
say, 10 per cent of their already restricted
supplies and hand them over to margarine
m.anufacturers in Canada.
I do not think anyone would deny that
that could be done, but that would not
increase our sum total of fats at all; it would
simply divert 18 million pounds from the
various bakeries and shortening plants across
the country to margarine factories. As a
result there would be the equivalent in margarine of however much could be produced
from 18 million pounds of fats. I do not
know what the ratio is, but let us say that
this quantity of fat would suffice for 12
million pounds of oleomargarine, or roughly
a pound per person in Canada. Undoubtedly
there would be that much extra for spread
or other purposes, but the shortening plants
and the 3,000 bakeries would have their
business curtailed by 10 per cent. As far
as I know, there is nothing to indicate
that that could not be done, if it was considered
good domestic policy; but I suggest that
the board, and the government of which I am
a member, feel that it would not be in the
public interest. If the ban were removed,
what was done afterwards would be a matter
of policy, to be decided by those responsible
for it.
The second suggested source, and this is an
interesting one, is that we increase our own
production of fats and oils to be used in the
manufacture of margarine. Up to a point, that
is a very logical suggestion. It certainly is
desirable to lessen our American imports and
thereby conserve American dollars. The 187
million pounds of fats and oils which it is proposed to import in 1948 is considerably less
than the 268 million pounds imported in 1938;
nevertheless it is estimated that the cost to
this country will be $50 million, mostly in
American funds. No one can deny that it
would be desirable to increase our production
of fats and oils, and as rapidly as possible.
But let honourable members realize that that
would make very little difference to our overall supply, because if we increased our estimated domestic production of 300 million
pounds by 50 million pounds, it would simply
mean that we could import 50 million pounds
less. We cannot have increased domestic production and the same import allocation. Our

allocation would be reduced at once to the
extent of the increased production.
Hon. Mr. EULER: Why should it be? If
we produce more, we ought to be able to get
more.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: At the moment
I am not defending the present position; I am
simply trying to state what it is. Honourable
members who are familiar with the sugar business will recall that at one time it was suggested that we should increase our production
of beet sugar in order to get a larger supply of
sugar in this country.
Each country's allocation is based on its
estimated production, and additional supplies
are given to it to meet a certain standard of
living and consumption. That bas been the
arrangement since 1942. Every pound of fat
coming into this country is imported on a permit. Since 1942, and up to the present moment,
90 per cent of these imports was bought by
the Commodity Prices Stabilization Corporation Limited. That means that 90 per cent was
bought by one governmental body and sold
again to the various food producing industries
in Canada. I emphasize that in order to make
sure that there will be no violation of our international allocation system. Every pound that
comes into this country is imported on a

permit.
Hon. Mr. EULER: But not from the United
States.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I am not talking
about American exports; I refer to the control
of imports, as far as Canada is concerned.
Hon. Mr. EULER: From the United States
as well?
Hon.
country.

Mr.

ROBERTSON:

From

any

Hon. Mr. EULER: You said a moment ago
that no permit was required for those
imports.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I am trying to
make clear that in its relationship with
Canada, the United States does not issue
export permits. I refer to our undertaking
to control the allocation of domestic supplies
from imports. Every pound comes in on an
import permit and becomes subject to the
control of the Oils and Fats Administrator
in this country.
Hon Mr. MACKENZIE: May I ask a
question?
Hon.

Mr. ROBERTSON:

Certainly.

Hon. Mr. MACKENZIE: With regard to
the allocation made to each specific nation

APRIL 28, 1948
of the twenty-five member-nations which my
friend mentioned, is there a general purpose
allocation or a specific allotmezit -ta the individual member-nations of the group?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I do flot know
that there la any specifie allocation for any
particular purpose. I think that we indent,
as it were, for our supplies, and it is the
job of this organization to furnish them as
best it can. In regard to our domestic
supplies, the Oila and Fats Adminiatrator
bas the power, and exercises it, of taking
over ail quantities of ails and fats which
exceed four hundred pounda. He takes the
combined imports and dumestic supplies and
allocates them on a proper basis.
Hon. Mr. CAMPBELL: Io a permit
required to imnport soy-beans into Canada
from the United Statu and Manchuria?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON:
I understand
that a permit is required for every commodity
of that kind, flot only the oul but the raw
material to make the ail. That would
obviously be the case, otherwise the controller would not be in a position to know
whether or not we were receiving our full
allocation. Every pound of edible oil, peanuts, coco-nuts or other raw material, is
subject to his control. I amrn ot arguing the
merita of the system, I arn merely trying ta
be factual.
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: Did my friend say
that 90 per cent of the imports were subject
to permit?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Ninety per cent
of them are actually purchased by the Coinmodity Pricea
Stabilization Corporation
Limited; the other ten per cent are also
subi ect to permit, but are imported by private
individuala.
Hon. Mr. EULER: When we export vegetable oils, say ta the United States, la a
permit required?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I think that a
permit la required both as to export and
import. I arn glad my honourable friend
asked that question, because I arn advised
that our production of linseed oul in 1947
materially exceeded the estimate -made earlier
in the year, resulting in a surplus of this
particular product.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Correct.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON.- The systemn w'orks
this way: let us say that our estimated production for 1M47 was for 90,000,000 pounds of
linseed, oul, but we actually got 120 million

pounds. The 30,000,000 pounds in excess of aur
estimate is not of use ta us, I think, for
other purposes than the manufacture of paint,
for which we already have sufficient. Sa we
place that excesa at the disposal of the International Emergency Council, which in turn
distribute -it wherever it sees fit. In those
circurnstances we become an exporter, just as
the eastern countries are. That situation actually happened this year.
Hon. Mr. EULER : May I ask one further
question? We do export, some vegetable
ails to the United States as lias been stated
by the leader; but he is not sure that an
export permit la required. Arn I correct in
that respect?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I would think
a permit would be required. Otherwise, I do
not know how we could account for it.
Hon. Mr. EULER: My question la thia: To
the amaunt to which we export vegetable
oila, la it flot a fact that we get exactly
the samne amount back from other countries?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: No.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Again, I must
answer by giving an illustration. Let us assume
that when we make our indent we estimate
production at 100 million pounds, and we ask
for an allocation on that basis. Two -things
can happen. Firat, if the estimated production
of 100 million pounda dwindles ta, 80,000,000
we have a right to ask for more to bring us up
to our over-ail requirements. Secondly, if the
converse of that situation were -the case, it
would lie unfair of us to not give back to the
I.E.F.C. the amaunt in excessi of our requirements, which could perhaps be used for paint.
It is obvious that we would not keep that
extra 20,000,000 pounds. That is the way ini
'hich it appears to work; and in that respect
we becorne an exporter.
It lias been stated that Canada exporta other
items than oils and fats ta the United States.
I have already pointed out that, on balance,
the United States was in a state of selfsufficiency. I believe that in some instances
that country does export and import, and I
know that as far as Canada is concerned we
have scrupulously observed our obligations ta
other countries.
The honourable senator fromn Rockcliffe
(Hou. Mrs. Wilson) asked me a question some
time ago. The honourable lady senator asked
why, if we had so much butter, we could not
trad-e some of it with the United States for
margarine; we would have the saine butter-fat
content. Well, probably the United States
would be glad ta get the butter, and the margarine would be made available here at a

SENATE

iower cost. I endeavoured to get some information about the question. I asked the officiai
who shouid know, and hie repiied that hie couid
flot give a specific answer; but hie said that
iooking broadly at, such a proposai hie feit it
wouid be difficuit to admainister, and that
because of the transportation and administrative difficulties it wouid not be practical to
cwap these products back and forth. Again,
there may be some doubt whether this wouid
mieet witb public approva], a]though it is true
that peopie want margarine at the lower price.
The proposai xvould not have been practicable
a yaar or two ago, because at that time prices
werc subi ect to subsidy conditions, and no
gain wouid have resuitcd. Ail 1 can say in
rapiy to my honourabIe friend is that it is
doubtful wbethar the idea wouid ha feasible.
Every now and again I sec reports in the
papers that various individuals are offering
margarine which could be sold in this country
but for the ban on this product. About two
months ago it was announced that some person
had 150,000 pounds which, hae stated, could be
sold here at some price betwean 31 and 38
cents. More recantly I noted a report in the
Montreal Star that 500,000 pounds par month
of margarine had been offered by Dutch
intercsts. That quantity par month amounts to
6.000,000 pounds a ycar. In a footnote reference
is made to another assumed supplier who
would provide an additional 500,000 pounds per
month, but wbio did not want bis name
divulged. This man said be bad the margarine
available, that it was not subject to the International Emergency Food Council allocation
of fats and nuls, and that therefore it would
flot affect Canada's allotment of such other
commodities as shortening and salad oiis.
That statement seemed to me an important
ona, and I fait that some explanation was
desirable. The country from whîcb the supplies would be obtained was, it appeared, the
Netharlands, which is a member of the International Emergency Food Council. I was
advised that ail the council doas is to ailot
to each country a certain proportion of thase
products, and that if a country, having received
its aliotmant, had an exportable surplus, what
it did with that surplus was its own business.
For instance. if Canada, having a certain
quantity of butter, whetber from domestie or
othar sources;' was desperately in nead of
United States dollars or some othar currency,
and dacided to ration its own people and
axport 50,000,000 pounds of its butter to the
United States, or aven Timbuctoo, that would
be Canada's affair. Similarly, as I arn advised,
if the Netberlands or Denmark, because of
their desperate naad of Canadian dollars. were
prapared to reduce the amounts they consume

at home, they could export their surplus to
Canada or any other country. The only condition would be that the exported supplies
wouid hava to ba charged up to the respective
allocations of the importing countrias. The
rasponsibility of the International Emargency
Food Counicil ends wben it bias made the
allocation.
But if tbe importation of margarine to
Canada ware iegaiizad, and if from one of tbesa
outside sources we obtained supplies of margarine, what would happen? It is this: the
amount would be subtracted from our allocation as a receiving country; and tbe imported
margarine would be deducted from our supplies, thus leaving us short to that axtent
of available oils.
I ramamber reading not long ago about
a paculiar position in which Great Britain
found herseif.
She was most anxious to
obtain food froma Denmark, which having a
surplus, wanted to disposa of it. Britain was
willing to pay for it, but the Danes wanted
coal, and nothîng aise, in paymcnt, and tbey
withheld their food until tbay got tha coal.
Now, if any western European counitries
which possess an exportable surplus are in
need of Canadian dollars, perbaps I could
offar a suggestion. The bonourable member
fromn De Lorimier (Hon. Mr. Vian) is conducting a campaign in this country to raise
$10,000,000 to provide the cbildren of Europe
witb various necessities, particuiariy food, and
tbat, I assume, includes fats and oiis. Wbere
are tbosc supplies to coma from? You cannot
feed cbiidrcn dollars, you bave to give tbem
fond. If fats and ojis are necded, it wouid ha
the heigbt of folly to bring tbem from Europe
to Halifax or Toronto and than sbip tbemn
back across tbe Atlantic. I would suggcst that,
if Denmark or tbe Nctbarlands want our dollars and the cbildren of Europe need fats. and
fats are available in the countries I have
named, my bonourahie friand suppiy tha dollars and let thaese counitries provide the food.
Possibly there are places wiîuîe miar garîine
or the materials to make it with can be bcd. I
suppose wa couid resign from the International
Emcrgecy Food Council and resoive to get
our own supplies, aven try the use of 'the big
stick". But whare could supplias ha obtaincd?
You cannot usa a big stick against the United
States, whicb intands to raserve for bier own
nationals wliat bas been ailocatcd to lier. It
is truc that wc migbt undertake to increase
oui' domestic supplies; but I wouid remind
honourable senators that, aven witb the spur
of higb pricas, domastic production in the last
tan ycars bias shown a vcry sniall increase,
and a decline is anticipated. It is one tbing to
talk about increasing production rapidly; but

APRIL 28, 1948
the fact is that it is flot expanding rapidly, and
what wiIl happen in the future remains to be
seen. It is true that one item, vegetable oils
is in more plentiful supply, but the total production is flot very great.
I hope I amrn ot trespassing on the time of
the house. Some part of the explanation wbich
I feel it necessary to make has caused me a
certain degree of embarrassment. I do flot
mind admittiflg to some disappointment in
that the honourable member from Churchill
(Hon. Mr. Crerar) failed to mention that the
condition to which he referred is flot a policy
of this government with which I arn associated.
It came into effeet when a government of
wbich my honourable friend was a member,
and the senior member, was in power.
Hon. Mr. CRERAR: No. When was this?
An Hon. SENATOR: This was during the
war.
Hon. Mr. EULER: The war is over.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I arn referring ta
1942.
Hon. Mr. CRERAR:- Ah, but may I remind
the honourable leader that the prohibition in
the Dairy Industry Act which this bill seeks
ta remove was put into effeet in 1922 or 1923,
and that I opposed it then as strongly as I
oppose it flow.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: That is not what
I was referring ta. What I waB speaking about
was the international situation as regards fats
and ails and aur responsibilities thereunder.
Perhaps the honourable senator was out of the
chamber wben I was speaking on that matter.
I arn referring ta the policy with respect ta
the obligations of this country. It was put
into effect in 1942 by the government of
which my honourable friend was the senior
member. It could have been determined only
after a great deal of discussion. I am convinced that my bonourable friend la vastly
better informed on this matter than I amn. He
must have known about it; it must have been
discussed; the reasons for it must have been
given. I can understand him saying that
that time bas gone by, as the senator from
Waterloo <Hon. Mr. Euler) has just remarked,
and that the war la over, but I cannot understand him, absolutely ignoring the whole issue.
This applies flot only ta my honourable
friend (Hon. Mr. Crerar), but ta other memebers ini this bouse who were in parliament,
and wbo were occupying prominent positions
when tbis legisiation was introduced.
Hon. Mr. DIJFF: They were cowards.

397

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: They know what
it is. Every man who has stood up here and
supported the bill introduced by my honourable friend fram Waterloo, was a prominent
and outstanding member of parliament when
this policy was adopted and carried. My
honourable
friend from Toronto-Trinity
(Hon. Mr. Roebuck) was in the bouse, as
was my honourable friend from St. Boniface
(Hon. Mr. Howden).
Hon. Mr. EULER: Do you mean in the
House of Commons in 1942?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Yes.
Hon. Mr. EULER: I was not in that house
at that time, and you have said that every
member supporting this legisiationHon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Just a moment.
My honourable friend should be patient. I
arn going -ta refer ta the Senate, because there
are no better qualified men on public opinion
in this country than are ta be found in this
bouse.
Some Han. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Han. Mr. LAMBERT: I should like ta
interrupt before the honourable leader proceeds along this line. He bas spoken about
legisiation. Is he not mistaken in referring
ta the establishment of the Fats and Oils
Administration in 1942 as legisiation?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: 1 think my
honourable friend
from Ottawa
(Hon.
Mr. Lambert) is correct. The term. "legislation" is wrang, but my bonourable friend
knaws of tbe policy, because tbere is no
mare campetent persan in parliament today
an tbla matter. My complaint la flot that
my honourable friend does flot agree with
it, but that he does flot tell about it and
explain the consequences of it. We awe tbe
disclosure of tbat information ta aur consti,tuents. Wby sbould 1 be left ta explain tbe
facts? My honourable friend from Grandville (Hon. Mr. Bouffard) attempted ta explain
it ta a degree, and ail tbe tbanks be gat
fromn my honourable friend fram Waterloo
was tbat he bad "heard it a tbousand times."
Well, he la now hearing it from me for tbe
tbousand and first time. It is a factual
matter, and tbe people of this nation are
entitled ta information about it. It is all
very well ta say "You sbould not bave done
it". That is a fair argument; so why ignare
it? Is it not an important factor? You do
not want Canada ta break its obligations, do
you?

SENATE
Hon. Mrs. WILSON: Why should we be the
only country of ail those who signed the agreement to maintain the prohibition on the importation of margarine?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I arn not speaking
of the prohibition. That bas notbing whatoever
to do with the international situation. Other
,countries are flot concerned about wbether we
remove the ban or not. My argument is that,
whetber the ban were removed by the measure
introduced by my honourable friend from
Waterloo or by action of -the government under
the Geneva trade agreement, the situation
would be exactly the same. I arn talking about
available supplies. I have an idea that tbroughout thbe length and breadth of this country
there is a feeling that the only thîng that
stands between the consumer and margarine
is this prohibition; and I say it is flot so.
Right Hon. Mr. MACKENZIE: Has any
one of the twenty-five contracting countries
contracted out of the obligations of the
I E.F.C. conference?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON_1: No. Tbey are ail
living up to their obligation.
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: 1 should like to say
to my honourable friend that last year South
Africa, whicb is a member of that group,
started'the manufacture of oleomargarine.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I did not state
that it had nut. My honourable friend bas
misunderstood me. I amn not suggesting that
they cannot manufacture oleomargarine; I arn
only stating that we cannot get any more fats
and oils in this country by virtue of removing
this prohibition. What we may do with the
fats and ouas is not the concern of the I.E.F.C.
What I think rny bonourable frîcnd means is
that, if we remove the prohibition, the I.E.F.C.
would not be concerned whether we made margarine or flot.
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: Why criticize my
honourable friend for suggesting that the same
thing be done in this country?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTS ON: That is not my
argument.
Hon. Mr. MeLEAN: If we arc not to get
any margarine from Newfoundland, why did
we ban it in the agreement? Newfoundland
was prepared to ship it to this country. If we
are not going to get any frorn outside, why
put this in the agreement?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: My honourable
friend has asked me a legal question about
which I know nothing. It has nothing to do
witb rny rcmarks. What we will do if Newfoundland cornes in bas no bearing on this.

1 arn only talking about the availahle supply
of fats and oils. The honourable senator fromn
Leeds (Hon. Mr. -Hardy> said that be knew a
man in the United States who would corne over
here and manufacture margarine. Honourable
senators, that statement is flot according to
the facts. What the bonourable senator should
have replied to that man was, "Well, my
friend, this atrocious government" if you like,
"by virtue of its membership in an international organization, bas an arrangement with
the United States requiring import permits,
and until we get clear of that government or
the arrangement you can do nothing for us."
That is the answer.
Hon. Mr. EULER: No, it is flot.
Hon. Mr. HOW'ARD: Sure it is.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I bave no douht
thiat my honourable friend from Ottawa (Hon.
Mr. Larnbert) is more conversant with our
obligations under the Hyde Park agreement
than any other man in this bouse. He should
have given us the benefit of bis knowledge.
Hon.
Mr.
CAMPBELL:
Honourable
s'enat orsHon. Mr. CRERAR: I dislike very much
interrupting a speaker wben be is addressing
the houseAn Hon. SENATOR: One at a tirne.
Hon. Mr. CRERAR: -but I think muy
honourable friend tbe leader of tbe governnient will admit that in the allocation of fats
and oils in Canada we can make any disposition we like.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: He bas said that.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I said so.
Hon. Mr. HOWARD: You were out of tbe
ehamber wben be said it.
Hon. Mr. CRERAR: Even so, is that a
reason wby we cannot manufacture margarine? In the second place, tbe argument is
based on the shortage of fats and oils andSorne Hon. SENATORS: Order!
Hon. Mr. CAMPBELL: May I ask the
honourable leader a question? In the event
of thue prohibition being removcd as a resuit
of the passing of this bill, or in the event of
the prohibitive law being declared ultra vires,
would it not be up to the Wartime Prîces and
Trade Board to decide whetber tbey would
vaeld to the great pressure of public opinion
and allow the manufacture of oleomargarine?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: You are quite
right. There are 3,000 baking industries in
Canada frora Halifax to Vancouver-

APRIL 28, 1948
Hon. Mr. EULER: And there would be
ten million consumers of margarine and
butter.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Suppose the government in its wisdom wanted to take away
from these 3,000 bakeries throughout the country 10 or 20 per cent of their existing fats in
order to permit of the manufacture of oleomargarine at some central place in this countrywhere, I leave to your imagination-surely it
would not increase the sum total of fats. Would
it? Is there any argument in answer to that?
Hon. Mr. DUFF: What about seal oil?
Hon. Mr. LACASSE: I should like to make
a replySome Hon. SENATORS: No, no. Order!
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I suggest-and I
consider this to be important-that consciously
or unconsciously the consumers of Canada
are being misled into the belief that the
passing of this bill would immediately resuit in
making margarine available in abundance. I
say to you that under existing circumstances
that could not happen, and that it could not
have happened at any time since 1946. I
repeat, this is an academic argument. It is
like a high school debate as to what policy
should be adopted when conditions return to
normal.
Hon. Mr. HOWDEN: Is there any reason
why if this ban were removed we could not
produce far more fats from flax and other
things?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I tried to explain
that it is desirable to increase our production of fats and oils, if for no other reason than
to save American dollars. But under the pool
system to which I have referred we are, in
proportion to our consumption, one of the
heaviest importing countries in the world;
and the more we produce, the less there will
be available to us for importation from the
pool. Our quota would go down in proportion
to our increased production.
Right Hon. Mr. MACKENZIE: May I
ask my honourable friend a question? He
said that the people are being misled on this
question, and I agree with him entirely. Is
there not a danger that the very passing of
the motion for second reading of this bill
would cause them to be further misled into
expecting production of large quantities of
margarine at an early date?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I believe so. My
impression is that the countless telegrams and
5853-27

resolutions about which we have heard are not
from people who are hoping that margarine
will become available three years from now.
A lot of things can happen in three years. We
have heard it said in this debate that in 1920
the price of butter was 75 cents a pound, but
within about a year or so it fell to 37 cents.
I am merely trying to point out the factual
situation, and I think the public are entitled
to it. Of course, I realize that the public
probably will pay no attention to what I say
on the matter, especially in view of the
attitude taken by our newspapers. The newspapers are as much to blame as anybody else
for the people's lack of information on this
subject. I generally look upon writers in the
press as knowing far more than I do about
what is going on in governmental circles.
Sometimes they are accused of having special
sources of information in government departments. My own view is that the information
we get from the press is based on shrewd
guesses and intelligent opinion. The writers
know what is going on. How is it, then. that
the newspapers of this country have maintained such a conspiracy of silence as to our
obligations under the International Emergency Food Council? It is not fair to the
people of this country not to let them know.
The newspapers have a right to argue against
the ban on oleomargarine, if they wish, but
why not tell the people what the facts are?
Hon. Mr. DUPUIS: The information is not
paid for, as an advertisement is.
Hon. Mr. QUINN: Even if my honourable
friend's criticism of the press holds good, what
about the boards of trade throughout the
country? Are they not in a position to tell
the people the facts?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: They, like me,
get their news from the press. My honourable
friend does too, and I doubt if he knew about
some of these things until I just stated them.
Hon. Mr. EULER: The leader is criticizing
the press for not telling the truth or not
stating the factsHon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Don't put words
into my mouth. I have enough to answer for.
Hon. Mr. EULER: Has the government
ever informed the press of those things which
the leader says are facts?
Hon. A. L. BEAUBIEN: Did the government do that when you were a member of it?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I think this government is very modest and does not give out
as much information as it should about what

SENATE

it is doing. Just what information newspapers
have received from official government sources,
I do not know. My point was that ordinarily
I find the newspapers are far better informed
on governmental matters than most of us,
even though we are members of the government, and I fail to understand how they could
not know about these international obligations.
The powers of the Fats and Oils Administrator of this country were extended about a
month ago. This is something that we here
know about, or should know about.
Some supporters of the bill say that even if
the impossibility of our obtaining margarine
at present is admitted, the ban on margarine
is bad in principle, se why net take it off the
statute books? I will give one reason against
removal of the ban, a purely local reason
applicable to the dairy industry in part of my
province. Whether it is applicable to the
industry in other parts of the country, I do
not know. In my opinion, even if the bill
were passed margarine could not be made
available to consumers for three years. If I
am right in that, it might at first seem that
for at least three years the measure could not
result in injury to farmers. But the difficulty
arises because there is little appreciation of
the length of time that would elapse before
margarine could be made available. I am net
particularly concerned about farmers on rich
lands strategically located with reference te
good markets, in the province of Ontario, for
instance. I can quite easily believe that many
farmers, even some dairy farmers, feel as does
the honourable senator fromn Leeds (Hon. Mr.
Hardy), who said the successful operation of
his dairy farm would not be affected by
removal of the ban on margarine. But the
people I am thinking about are the large
number operating marginal farms-and net a
few of these are returned men, for, generally
speaking, they did not get the rich lands-I
say I am thinking about the marginal farm
operators, who are having an exceedingly
difficult time te make things go.
Hon. Mr. DUFFUS: They are in the lowincome bracket.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: What matters is,
net what we think would happen te them,
but what they think. And I am convinced
that even the second reading of this bill would
indiaete to thei that the protection which
the dairy industry bas had for some twenty
years is at an end, tînt in consecqunce the
industry will soon be ruincd, and that for
them "ihe jig is up." Many of those people
would, I fear, be at the mercy of human
vultures in the forrc of speculators trying to

induce them te sell their stock and equipment
at panic prices. I say te honourable senators
that this measure would be entirely unfair te
farmers of that class in my province. I am
not speaking of farmers in the Milford valley,
who produce milk for the Halifax market, I
am talking about the marginal producers.
I believe that ultimately, particularly if we
get no compensatory advantages for the dairy
industry in the expert markets they still would
not be protected. If we cannot help the consumer why should we take that risk?
I am not qualified te say what the general
effect of the removal of the ban would be in
normal times. Some have said that it would
net hurt the farmer; others I have heard said
that it will. I believe the answer depends upon
whether or net, upon the removal of the ban,
there are compensatory ad.vantages te the
dairy industry in the export market. Should
tIere be no such advantages I can tell you
what the effect would be.
Honourable senators know that Canada now
produces approximately 350 million pounds of
butter per year, or about twenty-eight te
thirty pounds per capita. Let us suppose for
the sake of argument, that the ban is removed
and that there are no compensatory advantages
in the export market, and that Canada's consumption of butter is reduced te the level of
consumption in the United States. May I give
some comparative figures? In 1946 Canada's
butter consumption was twenty-eight pounds
per person, and that of the United, States was
eight pounds. True, Canada has no margarine; but the consumption of that substance in the United States was three pounds
per person. Canada used fourteen pounds of
shortening per person while the United States
used about twenty-seven pounds. It will be
seen that we have a fantastic consumption of
butter per capita. If the removal of the prohibition on margarine were te result in our
use of butter dropping to the United States
level, our consumption would amount te only
eighct pounds each for approximately 13,000,000
people. If, for easy figuring, we assume that
our consumption is reduced te ten pounds per
person, this would mean that our total consumption would be approximately 130 million
pounds instead of 350 million pounds, as at
present. Without compensatory advantages in
the export markets this would be serious for
the dairy industry.
My honourable friend from Provencher
(Hon. Mr. Beaubien) said the other day that
the farmer should give up butter making and
sell his milk to the cities. According te the
figures given recently by my honourable friend

APRIL 28, 1948
frorn Churchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar) it would
appear that there is not a farmer in this country who is in a position to seil milk who does
not do so. I believe tùhat with the high standard
of living in the cities today the consumption of
rnilk is extrernely high. It rnay not be as great
in the future as it is now. I agree with the
suggestion of my friend fromn Provencher; but
the ýextent to which the removal of the ban
will injure the farmer depends entirely upon
whether or not he receives compensatory
advantages in the mnarkets outside Canada.
,I now wish to say a word or two with regard
to the future, and 1 apologize to my friend
(Hon. Mr. Euler) for taking so much time.
Hon. Mr. EULER: Go ahead.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: My friend has
asked me so many questions that he must hear
some of the responsibility for the length of my
rernarks.
I corne flrst to the question of principle.* I
arn a modest, long-suffering rnan, and 1 follow
the Biblical injunction about turning the other
cheek when somebody smites me. However,
there was a remark made by my friend (Hon.
Mr. Euler) wbich did not particlarly appeal
to me. He saicd that he wished the government would take its courage in its hands and
pass this legisiation.
Hon. Mr. EULER: Hear, hearl
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: The implication of
that remark is that the government, because
it does not do what he wants them to do when
he wants them to do it, lacks the necessary
courage. Human nature heing what it is, I
might well b-e ternpted to reply in kind. I
might even ask rny friend what about the Iack
of courage on the part of the government of
which he was an important and influential
member.
Hon. Mr. EULER: I have fought this battle
for more than twenty years.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I remember when
my friand put up a valiant struggla back in
about 1923.
Hon. Mr. EULER: 1922 and 1923.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTS ON: 1 have read the
debate of that day.
Hon. Mr. DUPUIS: What about government solidarity?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: We will corne to
that point.
From 1923 until about two years ago there
was a conspicuous absence of any agitation on,
his part for the rarnoval of the ban. 1 could
say to rny friend that it was because of a lack
of courage, but I do not propose to make that
5853-27J

401

observation. I do not believa that the Jack of
courage was the cause of that silence.
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: There was a surplus
of butter.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I amn glad my
friand bas said that. I thought ha was going
to apologiza for my friend from Waterloo
(Hon. Mr. Euler) and say the reason was that
the price of butter was down as low as thirtyfive cents a pound.
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: It was below that.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Do my frîend's
apologists suggest that the question of the
prînciple disappears when butter is tbirty-five
cents a pound and reappears when it is forty
cents?
Hon. Mr. EULER: I neyer said that.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I asked if your
apologists wera putting forth that argument.
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: I was wondering
whather, on the same basis, the question of
principle should be considered when fats and
oils are plentiful or when tbey are scarce.
Is the principla one that becomes effective
only when these produets are scarce?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I do not know
what point rny friand i5 trying to make.
I do not believe that rny honourable friend
from Waterloo (Hon. Mr. Euler) lost interest
in the campaign for the reason just suggested.
Even in my brief terra of office I have learned
that every member of the government does not
get bis own way. I have had differences
of viewpoint with my honourable friend on
saveral occasions before, and since as he doas
not appear to be particularly enamoured with
the governrent of which I arn a member, 1
bave no doubt I rnay differ with him in the
future, but I have neyer discountad his ability
or lis influence.
Hon. Mr. EU.LER: His influence is very
small.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I would point out
that if my honourable friend, in the important
positions whicb he held and the strong
influence be represented, could not do anything about the ban in the early years, le cartainly bad a champion when the honourabla
senator from Churchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar)
lent him bis support, for ha was at one time
senior member of the government and acting
Prime Minister.
Hon. Mr. EULER: You should not flatter
me to make an argument.

SENATE

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I do not know
what Mr. Mackenzie King's view on this subject was, but if my friend from Waterloo did
not have sufficient support in the government
he had plenty of allies outside of it, including
the honourable senator from Ottawa (Hon.
Mr. Lambert) who, I believe, as President of
the National Liberal Federation, had more to
do with electing the Liberal government in
1935 and 1940 than any other person. I point
also to my honourable friend from Inkerman
(Hon. Mr. Hugessen)-also was at one time
President of the National Liberal Federationwho should have been a tower of strength
to my friend from Waterloo.
It would appear that the allies were not
strong enough; but I do not give that as the
reason for the inaction of my honourable
friend from Waterloo (Hon. Mr. Euler), for
he is a host in himself. The real reason why
my honourable friend did not do anything
about the ban after 1930 was that in that year,
through the Smoot-Hawley tariff, the dairy
industry of this country lost a growing and
prosperous market for milk and cream in the
United States, and had to fall back on the
Canadian market alone for the sale of their
products. My friend did not proceed with the
matter because he realized that the position in
which the dairy industry of this country was
placed was entirely unfair and that there was
The developno possibility of getting relief.
ment of that market led to the sale of
21,000,000 pounds fat equivalent in 1927, but
two or three years afterwards the amount fell
to 32 pounds. The business was absolutely
eliminated. Our farmers lost that market and
were thrown back on the home market. I
suggest that this fact indicates the real reason
why governments took no action during
those years.
Hon. Mr. HOWDEN: In other words, in
those days there was not the need for margarine.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK:
lack of courage.

I

suggest it was

tempted to say sometbing about that were I
not, as I have said, a believer in the biblical
Not lack of

principle
courage, but the situation I have mentioned,
is the truc explanation.
Hon. Mr. HOWARD: The lack of courage
comes from the other side.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: It was not lack
of courage, it was good sense on the part of

my honourable friend. What he and his
colleagues said in effect, was this; "The dairy
industry have lost their export market. Before
we throw open our market to American
exporters of margarine we want their market
back again to compensate the dairymen for
what -they have lost."
Hon. Mr. EULER: Whether that be so
or not, I rather object to having words put
in my mouth.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: If that was not
the reason, my honourable friend will no
doubt tell us what it is.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Are you through?

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: No.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Excuse me for
asking. I wanted to move the adjournment
of the debate after this hour and twenty
minutes' talk.
Hon. Mr. EULER: May I ask the leader
of the government a question? He is referring, I think, to the years 1930 to 1932?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Yes.
Hon. Mr. EULER: What government was
in power then?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I could not
charge my honourable friends with the responsibility while they were not in power. I
am talking only about the time they were
in power. And I find no fault with my
honourable friends opposite: as a government
they did no different from us, and we did
no different from them. I am not blaming
them.
Hon. Mr. EULER: You know you gave
that impression.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I was referring
to the period where my honourable friend
was in office. He retired in 1930. But in my
judgmnent the consequences of the policy have
extended right through the years to the
present time. However, I accept my honourable friend's correction and I apologize if I
have misled the house in any way.
Now, taking the hint of my honourable
friend from Parkdale (Hon. Mr. Murdock),
I will conclude. I am going to enumerate
some questions and try to answer them, and
then I shall have no more to say.
First: Suppose we pass this bill, will the
consumers of Canada then be able to get margarine in addition to the butter, shortening
and other foods containing fats and oils that
they are getting now?

403

APRIL 28, 1948
The answer is, no, not for at least three
years. Where would the margarine come
from? The fats and oils used in its manufacture are in short supply, not only in Canada
but all over the world. The world supply is
allocated by international agreement, and we
are bound not to import more than our quota.
The imported fats and oils from this quota,
together with the fats and oils we produce
ourselves, are rationed out by the Wartime
Prices and Trade Board to the makers of such
foodstuffs as shortening, bakery products, and
canned foods, which are consumed by people
of Canada. There are no extra fats and oils
available for margarine. The only way the
Canadian consumer could get a pound of margarine at present would be to cut down his
consumption of ether foodstuffs containing fats
and oils by an equal amount. Under these
circumstances, there is no possibility of the
Canadian people getting any significant
amount of margarine before 1950 or 1951 at
the earliest. To pretend otherwise is merely
to perpetrate a cruel deception on the consumers of this country.
Second: Why not pass this bill even if we
cannot get margarine for the next three
years or more: could it do any harm?
My answer is, yes, it could do considerable
harm. Although the passage of this bill cannot possibly be followed by any important
amount of margarine for at least three years,
and hence could not hurt the dairy farmer in
the interval, the farmers themselves are net
generally aware of this situation. Such is the
state of feeling on this issue today that, I
believe, there are thousands of dairy farmers
on marginal farms who would believe that the
ending of the twenty-five-year ban on margarine meant the death knell of their businesses. It is not what we think would happen
to them, but what they think. Among them are
thousands of returned men. There always exist
human vultures in the form of speculators
ready to prey on their fears and induce panic
selling of stock and equipment. Such panic
selling and disorganization of dairy production is a possibility we must very definitely
take into account: it could be a calamity.
The third question is: How can the controversy over margarine be settled in a reasonable and constructive way, acceptable both
to the dairy farmers and to the consuming
public?
Personally, I believe it most important that
this perennial controversy should be finally
settled for the future in a spirit of constructive compromise. I feel equally convinced that
the passage of this bill is net the right way
to attack the problem. The compromise must

be found in the dairy farmers realizing that
public opinion is rapidly forming against all
protection, particularly in its extreme form.
The farmers might also consider whether the
margarine ban is really as helpful to their
businesses as they think it is. My suggestion
is that their troubles started when a promising
and profitable export market for milk and
cream was killed by the Smoot-Hawley tarifl
in 1930, and that they might canvass the possibility of regaining it.
On the other hand, the consumers must be
ready to compromise by realizing that precipitate action in removing protection is extremely unwise, whether that protection was
wise or unwise when it was first established.
The success that has attended the reciprocal
trade agreements between Canada and the
United States and the generally favourable
reception that bas been accorded the Geneva
trade agreements, is based on the gradual
nature of their attack on long-established protective devices. If and when the ban on
margarine is removed, in my personal opinion
it should be our objective to have such action
accompanied by reciprocal action to secure
satisfactory alternative markets for the dairyman. When normal trading conditions return,
if the ban were lifted, there would no doubt
be heavy imports of margarine from the
United States. It is only common sense that
this should not be allowed to happen until
reciprocal advantages for an even greater
volume of dairy products were secured in that
market. The one-way traffic is too great as
it is without making it worse.
Those are my reasons, honourable senators,
for opposing this bill.
Hon. Mr. DUPUIS: Would my honourable
friend hand that statement to the Canadian
Press? I arn sure that they would print it in
big type.

APRIL 28, 1948
I shall therefore confine my remarka to the
speeches previously made to the amendment.
I do not intend at this late date of -the
discussion te retain the attention of the house
very long.
Hon. Mr. NICOL: Of which amendment
do you speak?
Hon. Mr. LACASSE: The amendment to
the Dairy Industry Bill. I think I know
what amendment I am talking about. From
the start my honourable friend from Bedford
(Hon. Mr. Nicol) has done his best te
disturb me, but having been a witness at
court at least once, I shall stick te my story.
,Like my honourable friends from Kingston
(Hon. Mr. Davies) and Inkerman (Hon.
Mr. Hugessen), I would feel remiss in my
duty if I did not, first, voice the sentiments
of most of the people living in the section
of the province which I have the honour and
,the responsibility of representing in this
chamber, and second, state why I share the
views of those people regarding this issue,
and why I intend to support the amendment
of my honourable friend from Waterloo.
No one will deny that the trend of this
prolonged debate has been overwhelmingly in
faveur of the removal of the ban on oleomargarine. We heard the voice of the
Maritimes, the voice of Ontario, and the
voice of ManitobaHon. Mr. DUPUIS: And the voice of
Niagara?
Hon. Mr. LACASSE: Pardon. Les Sauts
du Niagara.
We heard these voices in one single afternoon, all favouring this amendment as, previously and since, three senators from Canada's
largest city, Montreal, have done. That was
the truc reflection of the opinion held throughout the country. There have been, of course,
some strong protests against the adoption of
the measure before us. These have been made
mostly, if net exclusively, by senators representing the Quebec district and Nova Scotia;
but the authority of their words is considerably weakened by the fact that in their own
respective communities unanimous resolutions
have been adopted by representative bodies
appealing to the government for the immediate removal of the ban on oleomargarine.
I shall not undertake this afternoon to reply
in detail to those eloquent speeches. I will
limit myself to answering what I believe te
have been their main arguments. As to my
honourable friend from Grandville (Hon. Mr.
Bouffard), I shall be fair and generous, and
shall admit that his reference to a possible
misconception of civic and political freedom on

the part of those who invoke the solemn principle of democracy in supporting this amendment, was well taken. As long as human nature
is what it is we shall have te have laws. And
what law is without the element of prohibition
or coercion? It is a case of the common good
having priority over individual passions and
even legitimate comfort. I do net think anyone can reasonably deny that. My honourable
friend's argument was very much weakened
When he compared the case of margarine, whieh
is utterly banned from the country, to that of
automobiles, textiles, tobacco and what net,
all of which are manufactured or grown in
Caanda. I submit that his comparison here
was-I shall not say dishonest, but at least
lame and far from convincing.
My honourable friend from Queens-Lunenburg (Hon. Mr. Kinley) was not much happier in his comparison, although I thank him
for his most entertaining speech of yesterday
afternoon. He made very interesting and courageous statements regarding the excessive use
of beer and Coca-Cola throughout the land,
but he surely deserves the first prize for
optimism if he thinks he can change human
nature to the extent of having milk substituted
for those popular beverages, especially among
the ranks of the workers and the youth of the
nation. While he was discussing those things,
why did he not also express his disgust at the
fact that Americans spend more money on
gum tban on religion?
I am sorry my honourable friend failed te
understand me fully when 1 interrupted his
sarcastic remarks regarding the addition of a
colouring substance to margarine. I asked
him, "Is not everything more or less coloured
nowadays?" I was then alluding te the flavouring and colouring of drugs and also te the
fact that we doctors collaborate with the
druggists in that infernal habit-and I now
challenge him te tell us whether that daily
practice is a gross immorality.
May I add en passant that in expressing his
scornful opinion of corporation lawyers my
honourable friend was being far from kind te
his anti-margarine friend from Quebec City
(Hon. Mr. Bouffard), who is one of the ablest
corporation lawyers in Canada, and a distinguished university professer, for good measure.
Te my honourable friend from Kennebec
(Hon. Mr. Vaillanceourt) I dare te put a question which implies a comparison that I submit
is much more logical than either of those I
have quoted from his fellow-pleaders against
margarine. Why does he net, in order to be
fully consistent with himself, advocate a ban
against the importation of molasses, which te
my mind is in many cases a fair and wholesome

SENATE

substitute for maple butter? I hope my bonourable friend will net consider I am tee
persenal in this question.
May I now be permitted, for a moment, te
show one or twe more incansistencies in the
attitude ef those who are oppesing this bill?
Referring te, the recent statements of a minister, one bonourable senater emphatically
declared tbat if the manufacture of margarine
was permitted in Canada it would mean that
many people in fareign lands who are already
suffering fromn a shertage of ails and fats
would be furtber deprived of these foods.
Another boneurable member, advocating maintenance of the ban an margarine, quated a
different minister te the effect that ails and
fats used ýte manufacture the butter substitute
would have te he taken from the quota allowed
te Canada by international agreement. That
dees net make sense, in my humble opinion,
and I suggest that interested ministers and
senatars sbould hold an early conference in
order to ýadjust their views accerding te their
common purpese.
Before concluding may I reply te two or
thrcc questions that we hear every day in
parliamentary lobbies and some other places,
altbough net on the street, hecause these are
net questions asked by the average man wbo
bas a family te support. H1e is in faveur of
margarine, for he would like te have sometbing te spread aver bis hread in arder that
whatever little butter ha can obtain may
be left for bis cbildren.
Here are the
questions we bear every day froa colleagues,
questions which sbould be put under the collective heading, "Wbat's the use?"
What's the use ef paseing legislation in the
Senate which yen are sure will be turned down
by another place?
Well, honourable senators, if we listen ta sucb
an argument we challenge ipso f acte the utility,
the frcedemn and the vcry raison d'être ef this
chamber.
What's the use ef remeving the ban on
margarine wben we cannot get the ingredients
required for the manufacture of that substitute?
It is quite possible that ingredients may net
be ýavailable at prcsent, whilc abnormal conditions prevail, but let us at least open the door
te improvement and future development.
XVbat's the use of passing thec bill when 3 on
know that tbe butter shertage is only seasonal?
Hon. Mr. DUPUIS: Only for about a month.
Hon. Mr. LACASSE: Those wbo ask that
question usually add:
-andi m-hec the shortage ie over, nobody wijll
thi,îk about margarine any more.
Well, if nobody would think about it any more,
wbat damage could be donc te the dairy

industry by this bill? And by passing it now
we would avojd the necessity for a similar
bill next session.
Having disposed of those arguments of otir
uppunents in a fair and honest way, 1 hope
and believe, let me in conclusion state as
clearly as I can and in as few words as possible why 1 intend to support this very
important amecdment, te the Dairy Industry
Act. My reasons are these. First, margarine,
according to highly
responsible medical
authoritics, is not only a good substitute for
butter but aise a most wholesomc food.
Secendly, I am satisfled that the reme val of
the ban weuld improve the lot of the poor
devil who is condcmncd for the greater part
of bis life te live on a sandwich diet witb
nothing te spread on bis bread. Thirdly, I
cannot bring myself to believe that the
remeval of the ban on margarine would seriously injure agriculture througheut Canada,
netwithstanding ahl the arguments advanced
te the contrary.
Honourable senators, during the course of
this debate the word "pressure" bas been used
more than once. I am inclined te believe
that at the present time there are strong influences at work on both sides of the fencethat is being candid-but mere se en the part
ef the dairy industry.
fI is mucb better
erganized, and financed than the primary producers, and the consumers are net organized
at ail. I bave just uscd the word "financed"
and I used it advisedly. I shall justify the
use of that word immediately by queting a
few lines from an article published in Time
magazine, of January 19, 1948. They are as
follews:
Last week ene ef Canada's biggest butter
wholesaler's scandalized by wvhat was happening, pleaded with Ottawa to curb bis ... profits.
That sensatienal stateinent having remained
u-nchallenged, altheugh publishcd in a magazine with a. tremendeus circulation. I am
bound te believe that it was in fact truc. 1
wveuld add that in ne small degree it
strengthcns my conviction that it is higb
time the less fertunate consumers bad their
day.
HRon. L. M. GOUIN: Honýourable senators,
I wish te say but a few words, and I shaîl be
very brief.
In spite of my close frîendsbip with and my
regard for my honourable colleague who bas
just spoken (Hon. Mr. Lacasse), I do net
tbink tbe consumers will bave their day if we
vote in faveur of the bill nuw before us.
I bave listened wvitl interest te the remarks
made by our honourable leader (Hon. Mr,

APRIL 28, 1948
Robertson), and I am frank to say that they
have made a deep impression upon me. I
would even say that they have converted me,
for reasons which I shall enumerate.
The leader brought home to me the fact
that this is not just a question of whether or
not we are in favour of the abstract principle
of freedom of trade-which, by the way, is
my creed-but that we have to appreciate
what would result from the adoption of this
now famous Bill B. I say quite sincerely that
the honourable gentleman has satisfied me
that from a realistic point of view the long
discussion which has taken place, interesting
as it may have beenr-and I have no illusions
about my own modest and impromptu remarks-has been only an excellent academic
debate.
But we are now facing a practical question
of vital interest to consumers, and also to
producers engaged in the dairy industry. In
that connection, I may say that I have just
received a wire from the Co-Operative de
St. Urbain de Chateauguay, signed by its
president, Mr. J. A. Z. Ste. Marie. He sends
the telegram on behalf of his organization,
which is no way a capitalistic monopoly. I
know my good friends in Chateauguay just
as well as the senator now sitting to my right
(Hon. Mr. Dupuis) knows the people he
represents. This organization in Chateauguay
protests against permitting the manufacture
and sale of oleomargarine. Even if we believed
that they were wrong, objectively speaking,
I say that subjectively speaking their opinion
is at least entitled to our serious consideration.
The argument of our leader (Hon. Mr.
Robertson) which impressed me most was
that the adoption of this bill would threaten
to disturb our national economy without in
any way providing compensating benefits for
our population at large. It seems to me,
after listening to his eloquent exposé, that
the adoption of the bill would not in the
near future bring any relief whatsoever to
the consumer.
Hon. Mr. PATERSON: Will the honourable
senator keep an open mind on that point,
because I propose to shoot a few holes in
the argument tomorrow?
Hon. Mr. GOUIN: I shall have to wait for
the broadsides of my honourable friend, and
I may say that I am still open to persuasion.
I am just trying to make some kind of
constructive contribution to the debate, and
I am liberal enough to invite discussion.
I believe that the legislation that we are
now asked to adopt is premature. There is
5853-28

407

a good old saying in the English language

that one should not cross a bridge until he
comes to it. After listening to the address
of our leader I have come to the conclusion
that we will not come to the oleomargarine
bridge until 1950 or 1951. I say quite frankly
that at that time I should like to be called
upon to vote on the question, and I am
inclined to believe that if at that time there
are some facts which prove to me that
margarine is obtainable I shall vote in favour
of putting it at the disposal of the consumers.
I believe that if the bill is adopted it will
cause serious injury to agriculture, and I say
so for the following reasons. It will, at least,
demoralize the marginal-subsistence farmers,
particularly those who are returned men. In
the province of Quebec we have always had,
and we always seem fated to have, large
numbers of people engaged in agriculture on
what we call marginal land. Morale is a
most essential quality, not only in military
operations but in the carrying on of any
industry. Agriculture is the first of all our
Canadian industries and, I believe, the most
essential. When we pray to the Lord and ask
for our daily bread, if possible with a little
butter, we realize our dependence upon the
good habitant-aswe say in my own language.
It will be realized that I am in a very
embarrassing situation. For twenty-five years,
rightly or wrongly, the farmers, not only of my
native province but of all Canada, have
enjoyed protection. If you ask me if I like
protection, I will admit at once, with the
honourable senator from Grandville (Hon. Mr.
Bouffard), that I do not. But I believe in
equality. If you protect the manufacturing interests of Montreal or any other large industrial constituency, I want you also to protect
the producers in Chateauguay, Beauharnois,
and Huntingdon; and if suddenly, without any
period of transition, you remove the protection
from these rural producers, they will be convinced that agriculture is being sacrificed for
the sake of industrial interests.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: May I ask one question?
Hon. Mr. GOUIN: Certainly--many if you
wish.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: While you are talking about protection, what have you to say
about this proposed protection, what have you
to say for millions of children and poor people
in Canada who cannot afford to buy butter?
Hon. Mr. GOUIN: I will answer that question at once. They cannot afford to buy
butter. But they will not get oleomargarine
before 1951.

SENATE

Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: They will not get it
if you accept wholesale the arguments that
have been put forward. We have not had a
word of proof to justify those statements.
Hon. Mr. GOUIN: I have to assume, in
conformity with an old principle of law, that
al! senators are acting in good faith. I do not
presume fraud, even on the part of my own
leader! I think he is quite sincere. I say that
prima facie his arguments have convinced me
that he is -right. If my honourable colleague
from Parkdale proves to me that my leader is
wrong, of course I shall not vote in accordance
with the explanation I have just made. I am
in good: faith, as my venerable colleague from
Parkdale is in good faith. What I am trying
to impress upon him is that the adoption of
this bill would be premature; that the question
before us is not: Are you or are you not in
Even though in
favour of oleomargarine?
Chateauguay, Beauharnois and Huntingdon,
and also in Laprairie, they all want to hang me
for it, I wil.l say that I am in favour of oleomargarine; and if I were asked if I believe that
oleomargarine is a good food, I would say yes.
Probably I have eaten more oleomargarine
than the great majority of my honourable
colleagues, although I prefer good creamery
butter from my own constituency. If oleomargarine were at once available for the use of
hundreds of thousands of children of the working classes, who cannot get it now, I would
vote in favour of it; indeed I would do everything I could to have a vote taken before
six o'clock.
But I say that the present bill is no answer
to the question: How can we get either butter
or margarine for the good people of our large
cities, particularly all those poor children who
have always been underfed, undernourished
and underclothed, and all those poor underdogs
for whom I assure you, before Almighty God,
I have the greatest sympathy? I was not born
in a castle; I was born on St. Denis street.
I did not go to a private school; I went to a
little kindergarten at the corner of St. Denis
and De Montigny streets, close to one of the
worst slums in the city of Montreal. Those
horrible slums are still there, and they are a
disgrace to our country. I will not discuss that
subject today; I will just say that I am in
favour of improving the conditions of the
people, and I would support any practical
reform.
But just now we are on the subject of butter.
and I feel that is a problem to which we cannot find an immediate answer. So I believe
that, unless my colleagues are able to prove
to me that my views are wrong, it is my duty
to vote against the bill.

Hon. Mr. LACASSE: Am I to understand
from the remarks of my honourable friend
that under existing circumstances margarine
would not be obtainable in Canada in less
than two or three years?
Hon. Mr. GOUIN: I have to rely on the
testimony of others. Unlike my honourable
friend I arn not a disciple of Aesculapius, and
I do not intend to discuss the respective merits
of butter and oleomargarine. But if I understand correctly what was said by our leader,
we would not be in a position at any early
date to obtain oleomargarine in substantial
quantities. I do not say ýthat small quantities
might not be available before 1951; but we
have to be practical, and if we want to give
satisfaction to the poorer classes of our large
cities, we must make oleomargarine available
in fairly large quantities; otherwise there will
be inequalities. If the people in one district
of Montreal were to get a fair quantity, and
those in some other wards, say St. Mary or
St. James, received little or none, the situation
would be much worse than it is now. Personally I am not sufficiently well informed
to be a competent witness, but I have to
decide the issue in the light of what bas been
stated, particularly by our leader and our
honourable colleagues.
Hon. Mr. LACASSE: Starting from that
point, would my honourable friend tell me
whether, had we approved of this measure
when it was first introduced, we would have
had margarine by now?
Hon. Mr. GOUIN: I am not in a position
to answer that question. I may appear very
ignorant, but I must say frankly, even courageously, that I do not know.
Hon. Mr. PATERSON moved the adjournment of the debate.
The motion was agreed to.

prove up the dlaims. Then at the end you
have a new schedule, which. in some places
increases the various fees that are chargeable

ASSISTANCE

BILL

SECOND READING

Hon. WISHART McL. ROBERTSON:
moved the second reading of Bill 204, an Act
to amend the Prairie Farm Assistance Act,
1939.
5853-_28ýj

H1e said: Honourable senators, I have asked
the honourable senator fromn Central Saskatchewan ta explain this bill.
Hon.
J.
FREDERICC
JOHNSTON:
Hon ourable senators, the purpose of this bill
is to amend the Prairie Farm Assistance Act,
1939. The explanatory note opposite the first
amendment reads as foIlows:
This amendmnent is to provide tha;t the act
may apply to areas surveyed as settiement or
river lots in the samne way as it applies to areas
surveyed as townships.
There has been difficuhty in getting benefits
to residents on river lots, and this amendment
is for the purpose of bringing such lots under
the operation of the act.
There are four other amendments ahl of
which are perfectly simple. The explanation
of the second amendment reads:
The purpose of this amiendmnent is to provide
that where a f armner bas land in an eligible
township and land in an inchigible township hie
can ýreceive payment up to the full ýamount of bis
ehigible land; the effeet of the 1947 arnendmient
to section 3 (4) was that sucli paymnents were
pro-rated according to a farmer's holdings in
eligible and ineligible townships.
The 1947 amendment was fo-und. inoperative
in administration and is now taken out, leaving
the subsection as it was prior ta 1947.
The third explanatory note says:
The act 110W provides that a block of sections
having an area. of nýot less than a quarter of a
township mnay be taken into account under Section 7. This was interpreted to mean a quarter
of a full thi.rty-six section township, and as a
result it was rarely possible to apply Section 7
to the fractional townships lying along meridian
lines. The proposed aniendmnent corrects this
by making the section applicable to one-quarter
of the township under consideration, wbether
of thirty-six sections or less.
The fourth amendment is explained as folhows:
The purpose of this ainendmnent is te authorize
the collection of the on1e per cent levy on direct
purchases of grain by flour milîs, which are flot
licensed by the Board of Grain Commissioners
under The Canada Grain Act; such milîs are
flot inchuded under section 13 as it is worded at
present.
The explanation of the hast amendment is as
folhows:
This amendmnent makes ahl of the new provisions relating to the payment of awards.
applicable to the crop year 1947-48.
The payment will not be applicable to that
crop unhess these amendments are carried.
Hon. A. L. BEAUBIEN: Is it proposed that
the Red River lots, about which there bas
been some controversy, shouhd be inchuded in
and form part of the township? If so, will
that be retroactive to 1947?

SENATE

Hon. Mr. JOHNSTON: Yes, all these
amendments will be retroactive and apply to
the crop year 1947-48.

13. Page 3: After clause 7 add the following
as new clause:
8. Section twenty-four of the said Act is
repealed and the following substituted there-

Hon. A. L. BEAUBIEN: They will take care
of the condition that existed in 1947?

THE LATE SENATOR RILEY
TRIBUTES TO HIS MEMORY

On the Orders of the Day:
Hon. WISHART McL. ROBERTSON:
Honourable senators, I regret to say that it
is my duty to inform the Senate of the passing of one of our esteemed colleagues, the
senator from High River, the Honourable
Daniel Edward Riley.
Senator Riley was born on November 28,
1860, at Baltic, Prince Edward Island, the son
of Neil Riley and Grace McEacheran. He
was educated at Fanning Grammar School,
Malpecque, and Charlottetown Normal School,
and later became a school teacher. In 1882
he gave up school teaching and started for
the West, which was just being opened up
with the building of the Canadian Pacifie
Railway. He went first to Winnipeg, and
then moved along with the railway as it
was being constructed. He travelled by Red
River cart from Regina to High River, and
took work there as a ranch hand in 1883.
During the Riel rebellion he served as a
dispatch rider. Eventually he acquired a
ranch of his own, and became one of the bestknown and most successful ranchers in
Canada. In 1890 he married Edith Thompson,
of Darnley, Prince Edward Island. They
had a family of five sons.
Our late colleague served as mayor of
High River, ran as Liberal candidate in the
Alberta provincial election of 1917, and was

414

SENATE

414

SENATE

President of the Western Stock Growers
Association. He was appointed to the Senate
in 1926, representing High River. He passed
away in a Calgary hospital on April 27, after
a brief illness, at the age of 87 years.
As honourable senators know, Senator Riley
was a faithful attendant of the sessions of the
Senate. He was always on hand when parliament opened, and followed the discussions of
public questions with the keenest interest.
Early in the year, when circumstances permitted, be seemed to enjoy the opportunity
to revisit bis native Prince Edward Island.
As the season wore on, and spring came, be
appeared to become restless, as if impatient
of confinement within man-made walls. He
would speak wistfully of the "great outside"
and the open spaces of the country in which
he had so long lived.
In the passing of our colleague we have lost
a kind and generous friend and a leading and
dramatic figure in the building of the West.
For my part I shall not soon forget him. I
am sure that his great spirit will linger amid
the foothills of the mountains through which
be rode in bis lifetime, and which e knew so
well.
Hon. FRED W. GERSHAW: Honourable
sonators, as the leader of the government bas
said, the late Senator Riley was one of those
courageous, stout-hearted men who ventured
far into the then unknown regions of Alberta,
an outstanding member of a group of pioneers
who are rapidly passing away.
He established a home in the foothills of the
distant Rockies. where he and Mrs. Riley lived
strenuously, but where they maintained a
cheerful home atmosphere, in keeping with the
words of the old song:
Where seldom is heard a disceouraging word,
And the skies are not cloudy all day.
He and Mrs. Riley maintained the very
highest traditions of the ranching fraternity.
They were noted for their hospitality, and no
one was ever turned away hngry from their
door. Thev were alwvs hclpful and good
neighbours who gave advice freely to those
who sought it. Like other ranchers they
assumed heavy responsibilities, and sometimes
sustained tremendous losses; but their word
was always their bond, at a time and in country where there was much lawlessness and debauchery, their influence was always on the
side of law and order. They won a high place
in the community in which they lived, and
those who knew them best are the ones who
will miss them most.
As is inevitable, the end has come; there is
no armour against fate; leath layvs its icy hand
even on kings. It is fitting that we should

pay tribute to the late Senator Riley at this
time, hoping that his long and useful life will
be an inspiration to those who come after him.
Hon. JOHN T. HAIG: Honourable members, the late Senator Riley, as a young man,
left Prince Edward Island, and in company
with another young man, named MeIntyre,
from New Brunswick, started west by way of
Chicago and Minneapolis. They had both
been school teachers in the Maritime Provinces.
They had little money in their pockets.
Melntyre had a basket with some food in it,
and this they shared on the way.
When they arrived in Winnipeg in the
spring of 1882, they roomed together and took
jobs together in a lumber yard, where each
made $1 a day. About a week after they had
taken their new jobs, young Riley said to
Melntyre: "I think the lumbering business is
too hard for you; I can earn enough money to
keep the two of us in food and shelter until
you get another job."-Well, McIntyre became
the well known Dr. McIntyre, Superintendent
of Winnipeg schools, and an outstanding educationalist in Canada; Mr. Riley became a
senator and one of the leading ranchers of the
great West.
About five years ago I had the great pleasure
of bringing the two of them together after
having been separated for nearly fifty-five
years. They bad lost track of each other.
This is the story that Senator Riley told me,
and which Dr. MeIntyre, in conversation with
me afterwards, confirmed. I think it might be
regarded as an allegory typifying life in Western Canada in those days.
As the honourable member from Medicine
Hat (Mr. Gershaw) has just said, we shall
miss Senator Riley from this chamber and from
this country. He was a kind, wholesome individual who made all feel better who had the
pleasure of his company and his acquaintance.
I pay my respects to his family. I believe the
mother and the youngest boy have passed on,
but to the other boys he has left a great
heritage. May we here who survive leave,
when we pass on, as great a heritage to our
children.
Hon. NORMAN P. LAMBERT: Honourable senators, I should like very much to have
the privilege of adding a word of appreciation
of our late colleague, Senator Riley. I am
grateful to the opposition leader (Hon. Mr.
Haig) for having recalled the story which he
has just related. I remember very well the
late Senator Riley recounting those interesting
circumstances to me.
I greatly regret that the honourable senator
from Lethbridge (Hon. Mr. Buchanan) could

APRIL 29, 1948
flot be here today. H1e was an aid friend and
colleague of Senator Riley, and I arn sure
hae would have wished to place on the record
words which would have been more apprapriate and intimate than mine.
I have known Senator Rilay since I came
into this chamber ten years aga, but aver
thirty-six years ago it was my privilege ta
live in southern Alberta and ta have a fairly
close contact with bis cauntry-thase ralling
foathilîs and cattle-rangas which form ana af
the mast glariaus parts af this dominion. The
late senator was born in Prince Edward Island,
and in the latter part of his life, when hie was
a member af the Senate, hie loved ta return
there every year for a period.
I have always fait that ta know Senatar
Riiey was ta get a braath of the exhilarating
air of the Alberta foothilis. Samewhere, the
well-known poet-spansor af the great northwest, the late Robert Service, said ai that
country that the men tek win hier were thase
with "the heart of a Viking and the simple
faith of a child". That, it seema ta me,
portrays the late Sanator Riley. Unmistakahiy hie was a part of that foothili country: it
had lait its indelible mark upon him. H1e was
essentially the pioneer with some of that shyness and humility which aiten characterize
those who have lived their days, in the open
air and close ta nature. H1e went to the West
during the troubles of the Northwest Rabellion, and I think 1 arn right in saying that he
was possibiy the last surviving member ai
parliament who was entitled ta wear the ribhan
ai the Northwest Rebellion.
We shall not see bis like again in parliament.
H1e was a great character, and ana we shahl
think ai as being definitely associated with
the pioncer days ai the western country. One
cannot but feel that with bis removal, in
cammon with the passing from the Canadian
scene in recent years of sa many oi his generatien, "a story is passing away, a glory is
passing away, ai the humble who iounded a
nation in tha travail and stress ai the day".
Hon. ARISTIDE BLAIS: Honourabla sanators, when I read in the nawspaper yastarday
the sad news ai Senator Dan Riley's passing,
a great grief came aver me, and for a moment
I could nlot realize that this calourful figure,
this aid ranchar, aur beioved friand, would not
be sean again in aur midst, walking and chatting ini tha corridors with same aid colleagucs
from Prince Edward Island or Nova Scotia.
I have anly had the privilege ai knowing
Senator Rilay since I came ta the Senate in
1940. Immediataly I was attracted by bis starn
charactar, goodness ai haart, great simplicity,

,and bis complata detachment from ail the artificialities oi lufe. I was privilagad ta be admitted ta bis eircle oi friends, and I could vary
wall understand why he was sa, much loved by
the Indian tribes ai Southern Alberta. They

DAIRY I'NDUSTRY BILL
SECOND

READING

Thie Senate resumed from yesterday the
adjourned debate on the motion of Hon. -Mr.
Euler for the second reading of Bill B, an
Act to amend the Dairy Industry Act.

Hon. NORMAN MeL. PATERSON: Honourable senators, this discussion on margarine
bias been very interesting, and if it were not
for the seriousness of the situation it would
ho comic for its glaring inconsistency.
Our leader lias gone to great lengths to
pr-ove that, nu uîatter wbat action is taken,
margarine could not be made available or the
situation eased in any particular way for at
least thiree years. Yet we bave the spectacle
of the greatest lobby in history going on to
prevent its manufacture or import. Eitber we
are being misled by figures or tliere is something wu bove flot been told.
There bias not been the slightest shadow of
proof that if margarine were permitted it
would not be manufactured ont of what is now
wastecl or uxported in the raw without a corresponding credit against our quota. I wil
give you onu item. In 'cleaning wbpat at the
head of the lakes we take out weed seeds,
There are over
many of them oil-bearing.
400 varieties of wild mustard. The hall
mustoî'd is fuill of oil, and for years we bave
been selling our seeds as screunings to the
United States, w'bere tbey separate the various
seeds.
Lately wu have done somu of tbe selecting
by new, improved machinury, and bave shipped thousands of tons of hall mustard to
Duluth and Minneapolis, wheru it is crushcd
and processed into olive oil and other edible
oils. Onu hundreci thousand tons equals 200
million pounds; and if hoîlf of that is oul, we
hiave 100 million pounds. In about a month
a plant will start running at Fort William to
make the oil theru. There are other products
which wvould bu availahle and whichi would
probably more thoan make up what we import,
if they could bu made into margarine and bu
sold at a reasonable pnie. The dairy industry
knuws this, bence this fierce lobby.
It bias been said by bonourable senators that
they know this special privilege is wrung, but
that it is dynamite to change it. I warn this
honourable body and our governoient tbat it is
dynamite to do notbing. In the hast couple
of days I bave bad the privilege of meeting a

their sentiments on this prohibition are something that cannot be ignored.

years ago that the shortage of butter was

contrary.
the price is almost double; and the situation
will get worse if the figures given us at great
l ength by our leader are correct.
I was bronghit up in the West. I bave
been in close touchi ail my life with farms
and farmers, and few farmers in recent years
are in the dairy business. If margarine were
available tbey would buy it. as owing to slow
melting qualities, it is said to bu more suitable than 'butter, and it is chuapur.
The argument that the passing of this 'bill
mighit -cause the pour xuteran to lose bis
farm is so far-fetched as te, 'befnot worthy of
an argument in this house. If the farm was
boiîght on the strength of eighty-cent butter
and a eontinuing shortage, then the veteran

There may be 300,000 farmers interested in
manufacturing butter for sale, but I doubt
this figure. I would eut that right in balf,
if I made a guess. But 1 do know there are
13 million esters of butter in Canada, and 1

question. If tbe dairy industry can be belped
by a bonuis to increase 'butter output, Jet us

it.
The bonourable leader opposite (Hon. Mr.
Hlaig) said from the very place wbere bie is

sitting, that he is now and always will be opposed to special privilege. What more glaring
example in all Canada is there than this butter
situation? I challenge him to show his dislike
for special privilege. Remember, 13 million
people in Canada eat butter and are watching
us and what we do.
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN moved the adjournment
of the debate.
The motion was agreed to.
VOCATIONAL TRAINING
CO-ORDINATION BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. WISHART McL. ROBERTSON
moved the second reading of Bill 202, an Act
to amend the Vocational Training Co-ordination Act, 1942.
He said: Honourable senators, I have asked
the honourable gentleman from TorontoTrinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck) to explain this
biH.
Hon. ARTHUR W. ROEBUCK: Honourable senators, one feels somewhat diffident in
tumning from a controversial bill, such as that
touching margarine, to speak on a very normal
subject like vocational training. It is a little
like coming down from the sublime to the
mundane, but I suppose we have to get our
feet on the ground again after the excitement
of yesterday and its continuation today. In
the circumstances I hope that honourable senators will exercise some patience in giving me
attention while I try to explain this measure.
The bill is a very short one, containing a
proposed amendment couched in a single line
of seven words, and intended to replace two or
three lines, containing thirty words, in one
of the subsections of the present act. Yet,
honourable senators, we should not judge bills
by their length any more than we should
judge men and women by their size.
Hon. Mr. HORNER: Or by the length of
their speeches.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: No, even if they
sometimes last an hour and a half. I have, by
the way, known some little women in my time
-little, but oh myl This is a little bill, but
it is not without its importance, and, in its
setting, by no means without its interest. It
raises a number of subjects.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: This biH does not
appear to be on file.
Hon. Mr. CRERAR: Yes, it is on the file.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: It is not on my file, and
I object to the honourable gentleman proceeding until it is on my file.

Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: It has been distributed. Does the honourable gentleman ask
me to adjourn the debate because a copy of
the bill is not on his file?
Hon. Mr. BURCHILL: I will lend the
honourable gentleman my file, if he wishes it.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: On a point of order, I wish
to raise objection. The files are not being
properly kept. Here is my file without a copy
of this bill. I am always in attendance hereI have missed only one sitting this sessionand I do not think my file should be incomplete. I would ask the Clerk of the house to
set that this does not happen in future. I
suggest that my honourable friend go ahead.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: I remember that a
few years ago an employer for whom I worked
demanded in a very loud voice that his
employees should not make mistakes, and the
thought passed through my mind at the time
that probably the one who made most mistakes in that establishment was the employer
himself. Occasionally our staff may fail to
distribute a bill to a single senator; that sort
of thing is inevitable, and I suggest that my
honourable friend should exercise a larger
patience.
This bill is of interest and importance
because it raises and affects a number of other
subjects. It affects directly the Vocational
Training Co-ordination Act; it involves the
Unemployment Insurance Act; it touches the
field of education; it deals with employment
and, very drastically, with unemployment. I
have a special interest in both the Unemployment Insurance Act and the Vocational Training Co-ordination Act, as both these measures
were studied and approved in committees of
the House of Commons of which I was a
member, the first one in 1940 and the other
in 1942. Since then I have endeavoured to
keep in touch with these statutes and their
operation, though, I must confess, with indifferent success.
As honourable members are aware, both
these acts are related to the last war, which
was most predominant in our minds at that
time. Both of these measures are part of
a long-term program to meet conditions of
unemployment that were vividly in our minds
following the depression of the 30's. It was
anticipated that at the conclusion of the war
those conditions might return. The interesting feature of this small and apparently
unimportant bill is that it is a part of a
general program commenced earlier to deal
with -the anticipated evil of unemployment.

Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: Did 1 understand the
honourable senator to say that this was an
unimportant bill?
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: I said, 11apparently
unimportant".
Hon. Mr. HAIG: That is a good word,
Uapparently".
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: The amnendment bas
only e-even words in it, but it is nlot unimportant.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: It may cost us a
lot of money.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: Not so mucb in relation to the benefits conferred, which I shall
deal with later in my remarks. Considered in
its proper setting the bill, I submait, ia vitally
important.
The Unemployment Insurance Act stemmed
from the long period of unemployment in the
hungry 30's of which, as I have said, there was
dread of a recurrence. It was planned to take
advantage of the period of high industrial
activity to build up a great fund in anticipation of the "rainy day" which history and
experience had warned us might, follow. The
establishment of a system of unemployment
insurance necessitated, in a supplementary
way, the establishment of employment offices
on a national scale to take care of persons
making dlaims on the fund. Out of that coinprehensive system of employment officesdescribed by the present Minister of Labour
as the best, in the world-there arose the
necessity for vocational training. The war and
the nccessity for the training of men in and
eut of the services brought about the Vocational Training Act.
The fund to wbich I bave referred is contributed to equally by employer and employee,
and is supplcmented by a 20 per cent grant
from the govcrrnmcnt. As a resuit there bas
been accumulated a very considerable sum of
nioney with whieh to meet the possible con,tingcncies of the years that lie ahead.

The fund te whichi I have referred bas
iDeen criticized in this chamber because of its

employrnent program before us, of which this
bill is a part, it would ho most unfortunate
if w e in this chamber or the goverement
made the mistake either of accumulating tee
large a fund or, on the other band, of
unwisely reducing the fund or the contributions te the fund. It is imp~ortant te be accurate in this particular.
At the end of thc fiscal year 1946-47 the
balance in the fund was approximately 8370

APRIL 29, 1948

millions. That is a very large sum, but it
affects all Canada and applies to a very large
percentage of ahl the workers in Canada. The
benefits paid te that date totalled $82,000,000.
Hon. Mr. HORNER: Has the honourable
senator any record, or can bie make any estimate of the loas of industrial production
tbrough men having taken advantage of
unemployment insurance?
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: Well, naturally that
could not possibly he a subject of statisties.
It could only be calculated in the terms of
and ln the light of experience. Anyone wbo
inquired ln a general way as to wbat had been
loat by men taking insurance benefits when
unemployed, would also bave to consider the
burnan gain which bas resulted frorn their
having received a living allowance when
unemployed. The one consideration would
need to be balanced against the other. Then
one would have to take into consideration
the moral effeet of unemployrnent insurance,
on our population, the resultant lowering of
nervous tension and the greater confidence
of the workers in the nation.
I have said tbat the benefits to the end of
the fiscal year 1946-47 totalled $82,000,000, of
wbich $43,000,000 were paid ln that year. The
income in 1946-47 from employer and emTo
ployee contributions was $76,000,000.
tbis was added the government's share of
20 per cent, or $15,200,000, and miscellaneous
revenues, including interest, thus rnaking a
total revenue of $99,000,000.
The year 1946-47 was one of bigb employment, yet the amount of benefit. paid was
nearly one-baîf of ahl the income received.
Furtber, it is only recently that maturity bas
been attained, and payment of benefit is only
now beginning to show its full impact on the
fund, since the maximum amount la regard
to duration could not begin to be paid tili

maximum,

wbich is approximately fifty and one-haif
weeks. Over 65 per cent of ahl contributors
are in the highest class, and accordingly are
entitled to benefit at the higbest rate.
It is partly because of the high proportion
of contributors in the top clasa that the lucome
during 1946-47 was so high. Any large amount
of unemployment would not only directly
deplete the fund tbrougb benefits paid out;
it would also be refiected immediately lu bas
of revenue from contributions and a corresponding drop in the government's share of 20

419

per cent. For example, total revenue in
1946-47 amounted to $99,000,000, this being the
employee, employer and government contributions paid in respect of approximately 96
per cent of the insured population, reekoning uneinployment to have been at a rate of
flot more than about four per cent ia that
year. Now let us consider, in the light of the
figures which 1 have given, how safe and how
great is the fund.
,Right Hlon. Mr. MACKENZIE: I happened
to be out of the chamber when my honourable
friend began his remarks; but from my
analysis of the sequence of bis argument since
I came in, it would appear to me that there is
a certain confusion between the general provisions of the Unemployment Insurance Act
and the special provisions of the Vocational
Training and Co-ordination Act. I may be
wrong in the inferences I have drawn from the
observations of my honourable friend in the
last five minutes, but it would seem to me that
hie is dealing witb the larger mass of figures of
unemployment insurance, and not with the
special bill, which I put through parliament Ïn
19,42, and which made special provision for
vocational training and guidance for veterans
in particular, and which is administered
entirely by the Minister of Labour. If I am
wrong I should like to be corrected on this
point.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: I think my friend's
trouble arises from the fact that hie was not
bere when I opened my remarks. It is true
that the Unemployment Insurance Act la not
being amended by the bill before us, but it la
part and parcel of the general subi ect which
I amn discussing, and I have tied it in with the
subjeet-matter in a way that I arn quite sure
brings me within the rules of relevancy at this
time. So, witb the indulgence of the house, I
shall proceed, because the purpose, or one of
the purposes of the measure we have under
consideration, is the alleviation of the evils of
unemployment. That is true also of this fund.
The two will work together, I hope, barmoniously and efficiently. Therefore I have a
right to discuss both at one time. One bas
an effeet on the other.
Hon. Mr. CRERAR: I remind my honourable friend that amendments of the Unemployment Insurance Act will be brought before
this bouse.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: That la very true,
and I shaîl nlot discuas them.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: I think the hionourable senator (Hon. Mr. Roebuck) is going

(Right Hon. Mr. Mackenzie), bas suggested
that the discussion of this bill is going too far
afield. I certainly think it is.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: Honourable senators,
have not said one word about the subjectmatter of the bill to amend the Unemployment Insurance Act.
I submit that just
because we propose to make some minor
amendments to the Unemployment Insurance
Act, that does not mean that we cannot refer
to it. It would indeed be placing an extraordinary limitation upon debate if I were not
allowed to deal with unemployment insurance,
a subject which is directly affected by this
bill. Let me point out-

Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Honourable senators, could we not give this bill second readiing
and refer it to committee, where we would all
hear what was going on and be permitted to
present our views?

senator wishes me to cease speaking, and if
that is the general view taken by this
chamberHon. Mr. ASELTINE: Go ahead.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK:

-I

shall be happy

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Honourable senators, I had hoped that this honourable bouse
would accord the honourable senator from
Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck) the
right to proceed, even though, strictly and
legally, he may not be regarded as speaking
to the bill.
I have always appreciated the efforts of
bonourable senators who have given study to
bills in order to present them to this bouse,
and, having requested my honourable friend
from Toronto-Trinity to explain the bill now
before us, I would ask that honourable senators allow him to proceed.
Right Hon. IAN A. MACKENZIE: Honourable senators, in justice to myself, if no
one else supports me, I wish to say for two
reasons that the honourable senator from
Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck) is not
proceeding in the proper way. In the first
place he is discussing a measure which is not
before the bouse and, secondly, the 'nemployment Insurance Bill is different from the
Vocational Training Co-ordination Act.
I
should know a bit about thIat bill because in
1942 it was in my charge. Surely we cannot

discuss the whole question of the social and
economic problems of Canada when we are
dealing with a specific measure affecting a
specific group of people, and passed for a
specific purpose.
I am not going to press my point of order,
but in justice to myself I must make these
two observations, because my honourable and
va.lued friend is going far afield in his discussion of the measure before the bouse.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: Honourable senators,
I claim no indulgence from the bouse.
Though it is frequently extended, I do not
wish to accept it at this moment. I stand
on my strict rights, and will call the attention
of the honourable senators to the bill itself.
It states that the words:
to fit unemployed persons for gainful employment.
Are to bo substituted for the following.
to fit for any gainful employment persons
directed by the Unemployment Insurance Commission to attend a course of training pursuant
to section twenty-eight of The Unemployment
Insurance Act, 1940.
If that language does not raise the subject of
the Unemployment Insurance Act, then it
raises nothing.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: I would ask the
honourable
senator from Toronto-Trinity
(Hon. Mr. Roebuck) to confine his remarks
to the bill now under consideration. After all,
on the motion for second reading, the discussion is confined to the principle of the
bill. A question of order bas been raised by
the right honourable senator from Vancouv2r
(Right Hon. Mr. Mackenzie), and I would ask
the honourable gentleman who is speaking to
direct his remarks to this bill.
Hon.
tors-

Mr. ROEBUCK:

Hon. Mr. PIRIE: Go ahead.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: Honourable senators, I stand on my rights, and I think there
should bc a ruling on whether or not I am in
order. I feel embarrassed in being asked to
do something that I am not obliged to do.
I do not think His Honour the Speaker bas
any right to ask me to do this, that, or the
other thing, in the course of my address;
be should make a ruling.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: Order!
The
right honourable senator from Vancouver has
raised a question of order regarding the extent

APRIL 29, 1948
and scope of the discussion on the bill before
the house. I am endeavouring to control the
debate fairly and according to the rules. It
is true that great liberty is given in this
house, and I should dislike to see that
liberty curtailed in any way; but when a
matter of this kind is called to my attention.
as Speaker I must ask the persen addressing
the house to observe the rules and confine
his remarks as closely as lie can to the bill
under consideration. I know the honourable
senator will follow the directions I have
given.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: His Honour the
Speaker bas given a ruling. Therefore there
is nothing more for me to do except te read
what the bill says. The whole background of
the bill has been lost and a most interesting
subject has been destroyed by the rules of this
house-if, in fact, those are the rules.
Honourable senators, this is a short bill.
The first part of it reads as follows:
Paragraph (c) of subsection one of section
three of The Vocational Training Co-ordination

Act, 1942, chapter thirty-four of the statutes of
1942-43 is repealed and the following substituted
therefor:(c) to fit unemployed persons for gainful
employment.
This means that the words "to fit unemployed
persens for gainful employment" are substituted for the following:
to fLt for any gainful employment persons
directed by the Unemployment Insurance Commission to attend a course of traning pursuant
to section twenty-eight of The Unemployment
Insurance Act, 1940.
Honourable senators, if I cannot discuss
the effect of the two bills which I have
mentioned, there is nothing further to be
said. I did net think the rules would limit
the debate to such an extent.
Hon. JOHN T. HAIG: Honourable senators,
I just want to say a few words, and shall only
take a minute. I have no right to say anything about the ruling made a few moments
ago, but I think the right honourable senator
from Vancouver (Right Hon. Mr. Mackenzie)
My honourable friend from
was correct.
Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck) discussed the Unemployment Insurance Act. I
too should like to discuss that subject here,
but I know that in doing se I would 'be out
of order.
Hon. Mr. CRERAR: You will get a chance.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I may get out of order
without being aware of it, but I do net intend
te get out of order if I know it.

421

Hon. Mr. CRERAR: You will get a chance
later. There is a 'bill coming over from the
other house.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I know that. But I want
to say that it is very unfair for some member
to bring into the debate a subject which is
not strictly relevant to the measure before the
house, because, under a rule with which I
entirely agree, anyone who wishes to reply is
debarred from discussing that subject at the
time, and may only do so later if it happens
to come properly under consideration.
I do not like this bill, and I will state why.
In an address delivered some three months
ago at the University of Western Ontario, the
Right Honourable Arthur Meighen, a former
very distinguished member of this house, said
-I
paraphrase his words-that we were
developing a crazy thirst for higher education.
The Honourable Angus Macdonald, Premier
of Nova Scotia, has since made a similar
statement. Nobody could object to the education of our young people, within reasonable
limits. My honourable friend from TorontoTrinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck) has said' that the
educational courses contemplated by this bill
mélude matriculation and university courses;
in fact, there is no limit to the kind of
courses that may be given to people under
the operation of this measure. This is different from the question of making it easier for
veterans te take vocational training and university courses. When that question came up
in this house none of us could raise any
objection, because those young men and
women had lost three or four or five years
in the service of the country, and we wanted
te dio all we could for them. But let me
give you some figures. At the University of
Saskatchewan 4,500 students wrote examinations this year; I think the examinations
ended two or three days ago.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: Last Saturday.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Of that number I estimate
that about 800 will graduate. The number is
so large that they cannot all go through the
ceremony in one day. Now, there is no possibility of maintaining all of those graduates
in their chosen profession in that province.
At the University of Manitoba the number
of students writing examinations is about
6,500, of whom possibly 1,000 or 1,200 will
graduate. There is no possibility at all of all
of them getting employment in Manitoba. In
such circumstances what happens? Last year
30,000 of our people drifted down to the
United States, and those who did the drifting
were largely of the class I am talking about.

SENATE

The bill before us would just perpetuate that
condition.
I say to, the house, and I think facts will
bear me out, that the boys and girls who put
themselves through university become in large
mesure the pe'ople who make gond in this
country. I know what I arn talking about,
for I have been connected with schools and
universities practically ail my life. The idea
of taking mon-ey from the taxpayers of this
country and spending it on educating unemployied people is unsound. It will resuit in, a
large body of people taking training at the
publie expense, and the cost will be terrific.
Neither this country nor any other country
can survive unless its people are taught to
depend on themselves in making their way
through life, and that there is no easy way
of rnaking good.
The systeni of paying for education as proposcd by this bill will build up trouble for
those dirrectly conccrned as well as for the
country at large. It is an effective way of
spoiling people. The University of Saskatchewvan, as 1 bave said, had 4,500 students this
ycar, but the population of the province is
going down. Boys and girls will nlot stay on
the farm. Why should they, when they can
get a frce education at the expcnsc of the
dominion and the province, and thcn go away
to Ontario, Quebec, or the United States, and
obtain a good position?
Somebody may say to me: "You were
brought up on a farm. Why didn't you stay
there?" My -answcr is thiat I got my education by my own efforts; and I can naine
hundrcds of men and women in this country
who did the saine thing. I have no objection
whatever to that. What I object to, is the
thing that is proposed bv this bill. The Right
Honourable Arthur Meighcn and the Honourable Angus Macdonald souinded the first
warning of this challenge to our way of life.
Hon. Mr. HORNER: I think Sydney Smith,
of the University of Toronto, said the samne
thing.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Yes; and he is the most
experienced university president in Canada.
1
The number of students at bis university is
so disproportionate to the number that can
possibly be employed in Ontario as to be
ridiculou.
In nw' profession of law thcre are, I think,
75 young people graduating this year at Winnipeg. There is not enough business to support
more than 25 new lawyers a year, s0 some of
them will bave to take business away frorn
some other person or cise do vcry little.
Hon. Mr. HORNER: I doubt the need of
any lawyers.

Hon. 'Mr. HAIG: That may be. My point
is that most *of us who are lawyers got into
the profession by our owri endeavours. We
were net given a government position, and
we did nlot take our university courses at the
public expense.
Hon. Mr. BURCHILL: You had better
gag your friend from Blaine Lake (Hon. Mr.
Horner).
Hon. Mr. HAIG: No. I rather like the
interruptions; they spur me on to new efforts.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: You know why 50
mrany *of our people are going to, the United
States, do you flot?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Certainly I do.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: They are going to
get something to spread on their bread.
Hýon. Mr. HIAIG: That is another subjcct,
which under the rules 1 cannot debate just
00ow.

Hon. Mr. HORNER: In this coun'try anyone can get a cow.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Honourable members, this
bill is 'the thin edge of a dangerous wedge. I
do not objeet to easing the way for returncd
soldiers to complete their education, but I arn
convinccd that the principle underlying this
mensure is nîl wrong.
Hon. Mr. CRERAR: May 1 ask if rny
honourable friend is opposed to the principle
of vocational training?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: No. To make rnyself
clear, let me illustrate what I mean. In the
city of Winnipeg-and that is "some" citywc have two kinds of high schools. First, we
have schools that train young men and young
women for ýentrance te, the university, where
they will receive further training to fit -them
for carcers as doctors, lawyers, miýnisters,
teachers, ýengineers and so, on. And secondly,
we have, or we arc building now, a vocational
sehool, the cost of which is being shared by
the federal, provincial and municipal goveroýments, in the proportions, 1 think, of 25.
25 and 50 per cent, respectively. In other
words, the school is being paid for principally
by the people who live out there. 1 arn
entirely in favour of a vocation-al sehool.
If this bill were passed I should fear that
as soon as we ran into any unemployment
our vocational sehools and universities would
be swamped by young men and women seeking a free education. Many of thema would
be induced te, Icave the farms. I know that
is what I would do if I were on a farm and
conditions got tough: if wheat dropped to
50 cents a bushel, eggs to 20 cents a dozen-

APRIL 29, 1948
Hon. Mr. HORNER: And butter to 15
cents a pound.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Yes. I would go to a
sehool or coîhege and be taken care of during
the period of unemployment, because for
the time being I would be better off at school
than in any job I could get. But what job
would I be able to obtain after I left school?
I would have to take work away from sorne
ather fellow or go to the United States.
Too many people have got the idea that
if a young person goes thraugh university
f
and gets a certificate hie or she is assured -a nice ifetime job, with a good income and
not rnuch work to do. The people of this
country have to get that idea out of their
rninds.
We spoke about one of our pioneers this
afternoon. It mnust be rernerbered that this
is a pioneer country, and we must make aur
living by the sweat of our brow. Sorne people
may say to me, "Oh wehh, you are a senator;
you can talk thiat way." I challenge anybody
to walk the road that I have walked, and do it
alone. Except for my father, mother, brothers
and sisters, I got no help from anyone. I find
now that that experience was mighty good
for me. I think it is good for anybody.
I could point to boys and girls of my tîrne
who&e parents were wealthy, and who, during
their university training could go te, a show
or a phay every night. I went once during the
terrn. It is not a question of doing as I say,
but of doing as we ought to do to make a
strong country. Our young men who went
overseas in both world wars were outstanding
because of their individuahity and personality.
Those are the qualities that win eut in the
worhd. This namby-parnby business of bonusing people will only lead to disaster. I arn
opposed to this kind of legislation.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Would you pardon me if I say I think you are entirely
right?
Right Hon. Mr. MACKENZIE: Many of
us can say that.
Hon. T. A. CRERAR: Honourable senators, if we consider the amendment before
us this afternoon simphy as an amendrnent, At
is comparativehy simple. Evidently provision
is made in the Vocational Training Co-Ordination Act for the vocational training of a lirnited
number of unemphoyed, namely, those who
apphy for unernphoyrnent insurance benefits.
It is naw proposed to remove the limitation
and to make provision for the training for
gainful employment of any unernphoyed person. That is to say, the limitation that onhy
those who applied for unemphoyment insur-

423

ance could corne under the training provisions is now changed, and there is to be a more
general application of training benefits.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: This arnendment
goes even further. One does not have to be
employed to get the benefits.
Hon. Mr. CRERAR: I said "unernployed".
The limitation was that that one mnust have
applied for assistance under the Unemployment Insurance Act before hie could be directed
to vocational training.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: Yes.
Hon. Mr. CRERAR: By this amendment
any unemployed person could qualify for
training.
Hon. Mr. QUINN: It leaves it wide open.
Hon. Mr. CRERAR: I arn in syrnpathy with
a good deal of what has been said by the
leader opposite (Hon. Mr. Haig). Let us
imagine a return of the conditions of a few
years ago, when 500,000 people were unemployed in Canada. Could ahl of those people
apply for and secure benefits by reason of this
amendrnent?
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: Certainly.
Hon. Mr. CRERAR:- I arn inclined to think
they could.
I arn sorry that the honourable senator from
Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck), who
explained the bill, is flot ini the chamber at
the moment. There, appears to be a shight
conflict between the arnendment and the
explanatory notes. The last paragraph of the
explanatory notes reads:
The asnendment will permit training for ernployrent to be provided to unemphoyed persans
in suýitable cases..
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: Whether or not that
person is insured.
Hon. Mr. CRERAR: Irrespective of whether
he is an insured person or not. If out of a vast
number of unemployed, only "in suitable cases"
are persans to qualify for this training, who
is to judge as to the suitability? These are
points which I think should be cleared -up. I
may be mistaken, but it appears to me that
the amendment as it stands opens the door
very wide indeed.
The Right Hon. IAN MACKENZIE: Honourable senators, I regret that I was cornpelled
to interrupt rny good friend from. TarontoTrinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck) during the course
of bis remarks. I rnay say that the explanation given by the honourable senator from
Churchjill (Hon. Mr. Crerar), as taken specifically frorn the explanatory notes of the bill, is
absolutely correct.

SENATE

I had something to do with the passing in
1942 of the Vocational Training Co-ordination
Act. During the years of depression it was
found that there were 30,000 untrained veterans
out of work. As to the policy adopted in
1942, I would say that there is no specific and
accurate result obtainable. Checks which have
been made indicate that the vast majority of
those who took the training have been
employed, and that 98 per cent are employed
in the field for which they were trained, or in
some allied occupation.
Practically speaking, honourable senators,
there are no vocationally-trained unemployed
in Canada today. The success of the scheme
passed in 1942 justifies the slight broadening
of the terms of the act as proposed by this
bill. The honourable leader opposite (Hon.
Mr. Haig) dealt with the question of university training. Along with my 1942 cabinet
colleagues I must accept-and I do so with
alacrity-a large share of responsibility for
the general rehabilitation policy of the
Dominion of Canada. But may I say that
this scheme was not initiated by the cabinet
or by a committee of the cabinet. The specific
recommendation was first considered for a
period of eighteen months by a committee of
practical educationalists from all over Canada
before it was presented to the government.
It was then endorsed unanimously by the committee on rehabilitation of the administration,
and by the cabinet, and became the policy of
the Dominion of Canada.
I have every sympathy with the remarks
of the leader opposite about the essential
value of a university training and of the difficulties attendant upon obtaining it. I know
it as well as any other honourable senator in
this chamber, because since I was twelve years
of age I have never received a red cent from
any person to help me through a very arduous
and strenuous educational training. Frankly, I
thought we were a little too generous even to
the men who deserved the best that Canada
could give. But this year we are being more
generous still, in improving and increasing the
allowances. I am not objecting to that; I am
in complete accord with it. I do believe, however, that the real value of education derives
from the difficulties of obtaining it. In our
younger days we learned the value of the
experience acquired in overcoming difficulties.
It has benefited us in the various fields of
science and literature and in every avenue of
learning. I know it was of value to you, Mr.
Speaker, in your distinguished career in med-i-

cine in the far-away northwest, in the old
pioneer days. This is what made education
worth while. If education is made too easy
for anyone it becomes less valuable to him.
In all walks of life, public and private, the
harder you have to work to achieve great
purposes, the more you appreciate the results
you secure through your own character, your
sense of values, your integrity and your
assiduity.
I am glad to bu able to tell my honourable
friend that the total number of primary awards
granted under this university training schemefor which, though only as a member of the
national committee, I am to a certain extent
responsible-is 52,731; and the number of veterans attending our universities on February 29,
1948, was 32,634. I state with pride that the
standard displayed by those who, after serving
overseas for three or four years, took these
courses, excels that of any other students in
the percentage of passes obtained from the
universities of Canada. Seventy-seven per cent
passed with no conditions whatever, 10 per
cent passed with one condition, and only 13
per cent failed.
The ideas of my honourable friend as to the
essential value of the struggle for success, which
is the basis of the progress of nations, and
especially small and young nations, are fundamentally sound; but it is none the less certain
that the investment which Canada has made
under the university training act, as well as
under the vocational and co-ordination act, is
one of the finest ever made by this country.
The dividends are assured. Some of us may
not sec them, but this nation will see them
and bu enriched by them. The finest asset of
a state is its young citizenry, men and women
skilled in the arts and sciences, in law and in
medicine, in structural engineering and other
aptitudes so useful in a growing country. These
young people, who through the operation of
this scheme are the students of today, will be
the leaders of Canada when we-I trust after
many years-are called hence.
The motion was agreed to, and' the bill was

UNEMPLOYMENT

INSURANCE

BILL

SECOND READING

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON moved the second
reading of Bill 203, an Act to amend the
Unemployment Insurance Act, 1940.
He said: Honourable senators, the purpose
of this bill is to make certain changes, arising
out of the experience of recent years, in the
scale of benefits and contributions and in the
administration of the Unemployment Insurance scheme. The act lias been in operation
since 1940, during which period there has been
a very high level of employment and a
generally rising wage level. At the present
time it is estimated that there are approximately 3,000,000 persons covered by the
provisions of the act, and that the total
amount in the fund is about $441 million.
It is important to recall that the fund is
administered on an actuarial basis. Employers
and employees each contribute approximately
40 per cent to the fund, and the remaining
20 per cent is contributed by the federal
government.
The fund does not cover all classes of
employees. It excludes those with an annual
salary of more than $2,400, and also certain
occupations of an irregular nature which give
rise to difficult administrative problems
As honourable senators know, the purpose
of the act is to provide a cushion of benefits
to tide the employee over from one job to
another. The amount of these benefits is less
than he would get if he were employed, and
the length of time over which he may draw
them is limited. The unemployed person thus
has an incentive to look for work rather than
to live off his benefits. The act is not designed
to deal with the kind of mass unemployment
we had in the thirties, but the amount in the
fund would certainly be a useful cushion in
case of such a development, and it may be
hoped. I think, that it will operate to diminish
the possibility of large-scale unemployment.
The changes contained in this bill are
I shall therefore
numerous and technical.
mention only the more important ones, leaving
the rest to be considered in committee.
During the last fev years a great many
employees have noved into higlier wage levels.
Consequently, the ceiling on salary-rated
,mployces insurable under the act lias been

raised from $2,400 per year to $3,120. This conforms with the general aim of bringing under the
act as large a number of employees as possible.
The scale of benefits under the act has been
raised so that the weekly maximum for a person
with a dependent is now $18.30 as compared
with the old rate of $14.40. The scale of benefits cannot of course be geared to the cost of
living and still remain actuarially sound; but
rising wage levels have put the employee in a
higher income class for insurance purposes, thus
inereasing his scale of benefits.
The bill proposes some increase in the
employer's scale of contribution to the fund,
but the employee's contribution remains
unehanged. The original act was designed
so that, in the aggregate, the contributions of
employers and employees would be approximately equal.
In the case of lower-paid
workers, however, the employer's contribution
was substantially larger than the employee's,
while in the case of the higher-paid worker the
reverse held true. So many workers have
moved into higher wage brackets in recent
years that the aggregate contributions of
employees now exceed those of employers. For
that reason the contribution scale for employers in the various classes lias been raised. and
a new wage class has been added for persons
earning $34 a week or more, with employer and
employee each contributing 42 cents weekly.
Other important changes include provisions
designed to simplify administration and speed
up the payment of benefits; to release the
employer from his obligation to make contributions for employees who are specifically
exempted from the scheme by certificate; and
to tighten up the provisions for dealing with
evasions of the act.
In conclusion, I miglit add that benefits paid
to employees since the inauguration of the
fund have totalled $111 million, and that more
than $34,000,000 interest lias been earned on
securities held by the fund.
If, after consideration, honourable senators
sec fit to give the bill second reading, I would
suggest that it be referred to the Standing
Committee on Immigration and Labour, where
there would be opportunity to hear the departmental officials, examine the proposed changes
and secure such additional information as may
be required.
Right Hon. Mr. MACKENZIE: May I ask
the honourable senator a question?
Considering Canada's population and the number
of years during which the Unemployment
Insurance Act lias been in operation, how
would our reserve fund compare, on a per
capita basis, witl those in countries where

MAY 3, 1948

such schemes as this have been established for
twenty-five or thirty-five years?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Honourable senators, I have no specific information on that
point. Our Unemployment Insurance Act has
been in existence during a period in which
there has been a very high degree of employment, and I assume that the demands upon
it would not have been as great proportionately
as they would have been had the act been in
force in the pre-war years.
Hon. Mr. CRERAR: Can my honourable
friend inform the house as to the amount in
the fund at the present time?
Hon. M-r. ROBERTSON: It is $441 million,
and I am advised that the amount distributed
by the way of benefits is $111 million.
Hon. JOHN T. HAIG: Honourable senators,
I am not going to delay the house at any great
length. There is much to be said for a bill
of this kind, but I should like some information about a certain classification of employees
and the claims they have made for unemployment insurance. When the Unemployment
Insurance Act first came into this house I
expressed my view on it, and it remains
unchanged. I feel that what this act does is
simply te tax certain people in the community
who have no chance of ever getting anything
out of it. For instance, law students pay a
tax, and I should like to know how many of
them have come under the act and have
received insurance benefits. Secondly, I understand that about 70,000 clerks in the chartered
banks of Canada pay a tax under this law.
No bank clerk is ever discharged, I am toldexcept for dishonesty or something of that
nature-and none of them receive benefits
under this act; yet they pay a tax. This is
true also, though not quite to the same extent,
of stenographers and certain other office
employees. They pay a very large tax, but
there is little unemployment among them.
During the war there were many married
women who worked and thereby came under
the act; but as soon as the war was over and
their husbands returned, these women did not
want to work any longer, and in certain
instances they received unemployment insurance up to the limit.
I am persuaded that the act is largely, if
not entirely, for the benefit of seasonal employees. There is no reason why men in the
building trades, or men working in the bush
or at any other seasonal occupation should
not pay a tax to cover periods of unemployment; but why people who are permanently
employed and never likely to be out of work-

people such as bank clerks or law studentsshould have to do so is beyond me. Even a
lawyer, if he works for a firm in which he is
not a partner and does not receive more than
$3,120 a year, the new ceiling under the bill,
will have to contribute to the fund. Yet, if
he loses his job there is no other place where
he can get similar employment. The contribution is a tax on these people, and that
is the spirit of the act.
The second thing to be noted about this act
is that the public look on it as providing
unemployment insurance to protect people
who are out of employment during a period
My honourable friend the
of depression.
leader of the government was very careful
tonight to make clear that the act does not
do that. The people in Great Britain made
a similar mistake about their first unemployment insurance scheme, and when the world
crisis struck that country the scheme went
absolutely broke.
Right Hon. Mr. MACKENZIE: May I be
permitted to interrupt? The British scheme
did not go broke; the original unemployment
insurance scheme as introduced in July 1912
was supplemented by a new national fund.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I admit that; but so far
as the original act was concerned the scheme
went broke. Truc, they passed amending
legislation and voted large sums of money
to carry on, but the original scheme went
broke. I am using business language, not
technical legal terms. The public have an
idea that our unemployment insurance fund
will keep people insured during such a period
of unemployment as we had from 1930 until
it ended in 1937 or 1938-it really did not end
until 1939, when the war came on.
Because of these things I think the act is
unfair. It results in some great benefits, I
admit. For instance, I believe that the
employment' agencies established throughout
Canada are very good things, and I must
admit that in my city the officials are trying
desperately to make the agency a success. A
number of people go out seeking positions for
competent workers, such as first-class stenographers with really good ability, who are
vital to an organization. But by and large
I object to the act. My first and original
objection is that the scheme requires contributions from a considerable number of people who cannot possibly get any benefit out
of it, but who nevertheless are being taxed.
My second objection is that the fund provides
only limited insurance.
I should like to have placed on record,
through the committee, certain definite infor-

SENATE

mation, including: the basis of insurance; the
number of contributors who are in perrnanently
crnployed categories--such as bank clerks and
law students--and lîew m-uch they have taken
of the $111 million; what proportion the people
in those categories have get oot of what they
have paid in. I should also like to have similar
statistics for classes of -people in seasonal
ernployrnent, such as carpenters, bricklayers,
stonernasons and cernent workers. I arn glad
the leader intends to have the bill sent to a
committee, and I hope that the officiais who
appear there will be able to give us that
information. We are entitled to, it. And I
tbink it should be made very clear in the
Sonate that the scheme under this act provides
unornploymont insurance for only a limited
space of time betwoen one period of employment andi anothor, and that it is flot protection against a depression such as we had in
the thirties.
Hon. A. K. HUGESSEN: Honourabler senators, hiaving taken a keen interest in the first
unernployment insurance bill that was introduced here, that of 1940, and in the arnendments to the act that have been adopted from
time to tirne, perhaps I may be allowed to say
a few words with regard to the rneasure now
bcfore us. My honourable friend the leader
on the other side (Hon. Mr. Hýaig) hias
repeated this cvoning the complaint hie made
last year, to the eiffct that, the incidence of this
tax, as hie caîls it, falls heavily and unfairly on
people who are ýpormanently employed in work
of such a nature that they are nlot likely to
suffer frorn încrnployrnent or to get any
bcncfits from the insurance provided by the
act. The complaint is of course justified, if you
look upon the working community of this
country as~ being made up of separate sections,
and feel tbat the members of the permanently
ernployed section have ne rcsponsibility for
their brothers in scasonal ernployment. But,
honourable senators, fromn the point of view of
this rncasure I do flot loulk upon the coinmunity in that way; and, to be frank with my
hionourable friend the leader opposite,' I do
net think it is lookcd upon in that w1ay by
the peuple whio are perrnanently ernployed and
who make contributions to the Unernployrnent
Insurance Fund.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: But you do flot know.
lion. 'Mr. HUGESSEN: It may be very
unlikely that these perrnanently ernployed
peuple wxill ex er get anv benc fit froma the fund,
but I think that they are perfectly willing to
make thieir montlily contributions in the
interest of the worlking cornrunitv as a whole
and of thieir fellow Canadians whose positions
are less secure.

The suggestion that my friend makos was
made te us on many occasions in 1940, when
the first bill was under consideration here.
We were pestored, almost, with employers who
carne te tell us that the occupations in their
firms were se permanent that their employees
did net need the protection of unemployment
insurance and therefore should not be required
te make contributions. That representation
was made te us by the banks, by public
utility cem-panies and others. Everything they
said may have been true, but if we are geing
te departmentalize our unomployrnent insurance scherne in the way they suggestod, and
eliminate frern its provisions all the people
with relatively stable ornployrnent, the contributions by employers and ernployees in seasonal industries will have to be made higher
than they can really afford to pay.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: But those people wilI get
their rneney back.
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: We have te reirber that the cost would ho tee high fer those
less fertunate people who are in seasonal
industry.
ilen. Mr. HAIG: IJndor this bill, any yeung
man employýed in your office who receives net
mere than $3,120 a year will have te pay a tax;
but vou, as a member of the firm, will net have
te pay onu. D.o veu net get questions frein the
yeung men about it? I do.
Hon. Mr. HUGE.SSEN: My bonourable
friend must have more discontented juniors in
his firm, than I have in mine.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: No, I do net.
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: I have neyer heard
about it.
Mv honeurable friend alse said that the
Unernpluvirit Insurane Fund is net a remedy
for a great depre..sion sueh as xe hiad in the
thirties. I fulîxr agee with him, and I think
we aIl do. It i-. net ai complote rernedy fer a
mani who is geing te l)e eut of crnployrnent for
foinr or fiv e years. but it is a partial rernedy.
A man whe lias been employed steadily for
five years and making regular contributiens
under the act will, if thrown eut of worke, bo
(ntitled te uncrnpluymcnt insurance benefits
foir a period of une year. That w ould ho a
suibstantial cuiion. With nearly S450 million
cellected in the fond and about three million
peuple entitled te its benefits, the answer te the
question of the righit honeurable gentleman
frorn Vancouvcr (Riglit Hon. Mr. Mackenzie)
is that the average arneunt for ex eiy contributor new under the fund is about S150.
I welcorne tbis moasure, hionourablo senators.
I think it is a step ini the right direction. First

MAY 3, 1948
of ail, it extends the classes of income covered
by the act from $2,400 to $3,120 per year.
When the scheme was introduced in 1940
wages were at a certain level. Since that
time tliey have ad'vanced considerably. I read
in this evening's paper that since 1939, a year
before this scheme was introduced, the wage
level in this country lias increased by 79 or 89
per cent-I have just forgotten which is the
correct figure.
Hon. Mr. HOWARD: Seventy-nîne per cent.
Hon. Mr. HýORNER: And as wagoe have
gone up, performance and production have
correspondingly gone down.
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: What my honourable friend's remark has to do with the point
we are discussing I amn unable to, appreciate.
No doulit lie will enligliten me.
Hon. Mr. HORNER: I will later on.
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: In view of the rise
in the wage level since the introduction of
unemployment insurance, it is perfectly logical
that the salary ceiling sliould be raised.
Another favourable feature of this measure
is the increase in the weekly allowances
whicha unemployed persons are allowed ta draw.
The benefits are graded up from the former
maximum of $14.40 a week to a new maximum
of $18.30. That feature of the bill is most
favourable for two reasons: first, the increase
in the cost of living; and secondly the assurance that the fund can. stand this increase and
stili romain actuarially sound.
I amn heartily in favour of this measure, and
I shail lie vory glad to, hear wliat the departmental officials have to tell us wlien the bill is
referred to the appropriate committoe.
Hon. Mr. HORNER: My honourable friend
apparently did not understand the interjection
1 made while lie was speaking. It seems to
me that the reference in the act to "suitable
employment" is particularly objectionable.
I believe that undor the unemployment
scemo we are only c.roating idleness in this
country; men are required to contribute a
certain sum of money, and when they become
unomployed they refuse to take available
employmont bocause it is not "suitable". If
that word could lie eliminated, and a man wlio
was willing to work could be sent to work as
formerly lie could, this legislation would
appoal to me more strongly. Nowadays it
takes two or tliroo mon to do what one man
formorly did. In my opinion this wliole sceme
has nmade a bad situation stili worse.
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: Surely, if my
honourable friend has seen the latost figures
on employment in this country-thie higliest in

429

our history-he will appreciate that there is
no justification for saying that such a selieme
as this prevents men from working or
encourages unemployment.
Hon. Mr. HORNER: The reason there is
fuît employment today is that it takes two
or three men to do what one man did formerly.
Riglit Hon. IAN MACKENZIE: Honourable senators, liaving been, as a very young
man, in a small way responsible for the
inauguration of the great Lloyd George insurance selieme enacted in the Old Country in
1912, perhaps I wilI lie permitted te make a
remark or two on this subjeot. It was my
privilege in those days to speak tliroughout
my old liome land of Scotland and the equally
great country of England upon the essential
and vital principle of tlie national unemployment insurance selieme.
I wisli to inform my lionourable friend (Hon.
Mr. Horner), wliose sincerity I do not for a
moment impugn, that if any one measure lias
saved Great Britain in, pence and in the ugly
years of war between 1912 and 1948, it lias
been the selieme of national unemployment
insurance passed in 1912 by David Lloyd
George and the Lilieral administration of that
day. Tlie old age pension selieme of 1911 was
followed by national liealth insurance and the
concomitant national unomployment insurance
measure of 1912.
I disagree with my honourable friend from,
Blaine Lake, whose ideals I so mucli appreciate, wlien lie says that unemployment insurance is no cure for depression. I say that
witliout a strong nationally-supported selieme
of unempîcyment insuranceHon. Mr. HORNER: May I interrupt?
Riglit Hon. Mr. MA'CKENZI'E: I liad not
finished my sentence. But go ahead.
Hon. Mr. HORNER: I have a question to
ask the right honourable gentleman. I do not
know what my friend thinks of conditions
in good old Britain today, but to me they
are rather disappointing. I have wondered
why we have offers from some 3,000 ongineers
and men like my riglit lionourable friend, who
are anxious to leave England today. Wby
do sucli men want to leave that country if
the sehemes my friend mentions work so woll?
Riglit Hon.
Mr. MACKENZIE:
My
lionourable friend is terribly wrong. I may
say tliat I was nover anxious to beave old
Scotland, but I was most anxious to arrive
in that great country-the greatest country in
the world-Canada.
Some Hon. SENAT ORS: Hlear, hear.

SENATE

Hon. Mr. HORNER: If my friend continues
to propose such schemes for Canada, lie will
soon have to get out of this country.
Right Hon. Mr. MACKENZIE: And if my
friend keeps on repeating what lie says, he
will have to get out of this house.
Some Hon. SENATORS:

Oh, oh.

Right Hon. Mr. MACKENZIE: I was a
member of a committee on the subject of
unemployment insurance in 1940. I have just
forgotten whether it was a joint committee
of both houses or not.
Hon. Mr.
committee.

HUGESSEN:

It

was a

joint

Right Hon. Mr. MACKENZIE: I think my
honourable friend from Inkerman (Hon. Mr.
Hugessen) was a member of that committee.
We had something to do with the preparation
and organization of this legislation, and I
want to say to my honourable friend from
Blaine Lake that, speaking not only of the
general scheme but more particularly of its
effect upon returning soldiers, who were
specially provided for under the national
unemployment legislation of 1940, it has been
a great benefit to rehabilitation in Canada.
We were obliged to make provision for those
men from Canada who served in the cause
of freedom and Christianity.
Let not my honourable friend from Blaine
Lake think for a moment that I would dreain
of leaving Canada for any other country.
Canada is the fairest of all nations, and next
te the privilege of having been born in the
grand freedom-loving country of Scotland, I
can conceive of nothing more wonderful than
being born somewlere within the boundaries
of one of the nine provinces which make up
the Canadian confederation.
Some Hon. SENATORS:

Hear, hear.

Right Hon. Mr. MACKENZIE: A national
unemployment insurance scheme is one of the
finest bastions there could be for the security
of the men and women who labour at honest
toil. It is also a bastion for industry. This
house should follow the great tradition commenced in the Old Land in 1912 and in Canada in 1940, which is recognized today by the

International Labour Organization as one of
the most progressive measures in the economy
of the freedom-loving nations of the world.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. GUSTAVE LACASSE: Honourable
senators, I do not rise to speak in favour of the
motion or to oppose it. I simply wish to say
a few words on a subject which has been
brouglt to my attention recently. The point
could perhaps be raised in committee. I agree
with my honourable friend opposite that this
would be an opportune time to clarify, if possible, the status of that class of people who are
working on a commission basis. At present it
is far from clear. I have in mind one particular case in which contradictory rulings were
made by officials of the ýcommisison in different
communities. The matter has become a bone
of contention in various types of business, and
particularly among real estate people. Some
of them are strongly opposed to the inclusion
of persons engaged in what I may describe as
"spasmodie" employment, for that term seems
applicable to agents working on commission.
At times their business is brisk; at other times
it is absolutely flat; it varies according to the
whims and fancies of the community and general business conditions, comparing for the
most part to the great law of supply and
demand.
To sum up, I want to reiterate as clearly as
I can that some effort should be made to
clarify the provisions of the act in order that
all may know whether people working on a
commission basis are subject to it. To my
personal knowledge as a newspaper publisher,
soliciting agents working on commission are
in some cases held to be subject to the act,
while in others they do not come under it.
The law in relation te this class should be
made practical, clear and definite.
The motion was agreed te, and the bill
was read the second time, on division.

SECOND READING

The Sonate resumed from Thursday, April
29, the adjourned debate on the motion of
Hon. Mr. Euler for the second reading of
Bill B, an Act ta amend The Dairy Industry
Act.
Hon. SALTEIR A. HAYDEN: Honourable
senators, a great deal has been said in this
debate about the position of the farmers and
of the dairy industry, and at times some
thought has been given even ta the position of
the consumers and the underfed and undernourished children of aur land, for whom at
the preserit time butter seems to be beyand
reach. There is no difficulty in knowing where
I stand on this subject, because on previaus

SENATE

occasions when the bill was before this chamber I voted in favour of it; and in case some
honourable senator may suppose that I have
changed my mind, I announce at the beginning of my remarks that I propose again to
vote in favour of this measure.
The other day, when temperatures ran high
and the debate got particularly warm, I was
a little fearful that we might have to anticipate the lifting of the ban and get some margarine into the debate, to keep things from
burning up. Howcver, we managed to survive that hazard, and we are proceeding with
the discussion in the hope that very shortly
we shall reach a vote.
I do net intend to speak at length, but
seme statoments have been made which I
wish to answer. First, I wouid point eut that
the

issue

appears

to be between

the dairy

producers and the farmers on the one hand,
and the consuming publie of Canada on the
other-particularly those who, either by reason
of the cost of the comnodity or its scarcity,
are not able te get all tho butter they require
for their daily sustenance. In these circumstances I feel that in favouring the interests
of the consumer, and taking an over-all
national view of the situation in the light of
the general good of the greatest number, I
an in no way prejudicing the position of the
dairv producers and the farmers. The type
of legislation which prohilbits thec ianufacture
:n Canada of an article of food tbat is wholeone, nutritious, and essential in flie dit of
the people, is onething that in my opinion
cannot b justifiod on any ground. It is
intolerance and class legislation of the most
extreme kind.
May I just review what has been said
against this bill? We have been told that the
passag-- of the bill wold be prejudicial to
the interests of the dairy producers and
farmers. We hbave been told, secondly, that
even if we paxssed the bill it would accomplish
nothing; ihat because of an over-all shortage
of fats and oils, no margarine could be nade
in Canada. Also it has been argued that it
would be politically- inexpedient to pass the
bill. The other day or leader on this side
(Hon. Mr. Robertson) urged several more
rcasons against the bill, one of these being
that thoc newspapers had in semo fashion
nisled the public on this issue by net pointing out that the discussion licre was purely
academie, because even if the nianufacture of
mxargarine were to become legal it would be
impossible to produce any of it in this country
until 1950 or 1951. The leader also stated
that the passage of the bill. whether it would
bh injurions to the farmers or not, would

throw thein into a panic of fear, and that
imediately human vultures would move in
on them and buy their machinery, equipment
and cattle for a mere fraction of the cost price.
Now let us get down to a brief analysis of
those reasons. First, let us take the question
of the shortage of fats and oils. The leader
says that the distribution of fats and oils is
regulatcd by the International Emergency
Food Committee; that if we diverted any
part of those fats and oils to the manufacture
of margarine we would lessen the quantity
ailable for other purposes, and that the
manufacture of margarine could therefore only
be carried on at the sacrifice of other products.
Then a remarkable thing happened. He went
on to picture the plighît of the 3,000 bakeries
across Canada, and how the use of fats and
oils for margarine would reduce the quantity
available for the making of pies, cakes and
other confections.
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: Pie crust.
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: It is a matter of
public knowcledlge that there is a world shortage of fats and oils. We all know that the
International Emergency Food Committee
regulates the world's surplus. If any country
produces a surplus in excess of its own requirements, that surplus is distributed to other
countries in proportion to their requirements.
There is nothing new in that. But the matter
of domestic allocation in Canada is our own
business. And who can say that ouîr domestic
allocation of fats and oils at present is perfect? Who can say that that allocation must
under no circumstances be disturbed, that we
must eot take any part of their present allocalions froi otlie thing- and devote it to the
manufacture of margarine in Canada? Who
can sav that for once we should net consult the
interests of the underfed and the indernourishced, and even of the healthy, normal
children of this land? To sugigest that it is
idle for is to discuîss or vote on this bill because
there is a world shortage of fats and oils, is to
beg the, question, for it lies within our own
power to make whatever allocation we wish,
and to decide the use to which our fats and
oils in Canada will be put.
The honourable senator from De Salaberry
(Hon. Mr. Gouin) said that he had listened
to the address of the honourable leader of this
house, and had been convinced by what he
heard.
He accepted the statements that
there was an over-all shortage of fats and oils
and that even if we did pass this legislation
we could net get oleomargarine; and he said
that for those reasons, lie would vote against
the bill.

MAY 4, 1948
May I present some pertinent questions for
the consideration of my honourable friend and
any other honourable senators who may have
been influenced by the remarks of the leader
on that point? Are we in a position to say
that the present domestic allocation of fats
and oils is the best that can be had? Are we
in a position to say that some part of our
.present supply of fats and oils cannot be
allocated to the manufacture of margarine?
Are we prepared, without further study, to
say that there are not available within the
domestic market at the present time edible
fats and oils for the purpose of manufacturing
oleomargarine? May I point out to the house
that there are quantities of domestic shortening on the shelves of our stores all across
Canada. To convert some part of that commodity into margarine would involve only a
further refining of some of the contents of
shortening and the adding of 20 per cent skim
milk for flavour. That process would give us
an edible, nutritious and wholesome article of
food known as margarine. Now, to ask those
questions is, I think, to answer the points
raised by the honourable leader. The answer
is that out of supplies available in Canada
we have within our own power the means to
manufacture oleomargarine; and the only
thing that stands between us and the doing
of it is the prohibition which exists at the
present moment.
I say in all seriousness that it is about time
we stopped weeping, as our leader did for the
3,000 bakers in Canada, and as the honourable senator from De Salaberry (Hon. Mr.
Gouin) did for the people who could get
neither butter nor margarine. I repeat, it is
time we stopped that kind of weeping and
gave to the people something tangible in the
way of a suitable butter substitute, something
necessary to their living and health, and which
they are not able to get either because it is
scarce or because the price is beyond their
reach. I do not think we should mince words
on that point. I am not here to appeal to
emotionalism but to discuss bald facts.
The honourable leader lamented the position in which the bakers would be placed by
reason of a reduced supply of fats and oils
for the making of pastry.
If the problem resolves itself into a question of whether we shall have more pies and
cakes or the people of Canada who need it
shall have a nutritious and wholesome food,
I am on the side of the people who need that
nutritious food and against those who want
an additional quantity of fats and oils in order
to produce more pies and cakes. If someone
must suffer, then it should not be the children
of Canada.
5853-29à

433

We were told by the honourable senator
from Grandville (Hon. Mr. Bouffard) that
Canada protects the textile and automobile
industries, and he asked why the farmers and
the dairy industry should not enjoy the same
kind of protection. First, I may say that my
friend is comparing two entirely different
things. So far as butter coming into Canada
is concerned, the dairy industry is protected
tariff-wise; but, in addition, it enjoys the
benefits of an absolute prohibition against
the competitive manufacture and sale of a
wholesome and nutritious substitute for
butter. If my friend wants to get an absolutely true comparison between the textile
and automobile industries on the one hand
and dariry ,industry on the other, I will suggest a parallel situation to him. Let us pass
a law in Canada prohibiting the importation
of all makes of cars, and a further law prohibiting the manufacture and sale in Canada
of all cars except Cadillacs. Under those circumstances, I suggest, we would have a more
comparable situation than the one he made
use of in his argument.
I say that a truc analysis of this matter shows
that the farmers and the dairy ind.ustry will
not suffer by the removal of the ban. If we
take the figures of milk and butter production
in Canada over a period of years we will see
that less than 50 per cent of the milk production of Canada has gone into the manufacture
of butter. That means that the farmers and
dairy producers have deliberately been choosing a more profitable market for their milk
than is offered by the manufacturers of butter.
I hasten to say that I am not critical of the
farmer or the dairy producer in the choice he
has made. I am not critical of the price
charged for butter; I do not say it is either
too high or too low. My argument is that if
milk producers in Canada are capable of furnishing all the butter, cheese and other milk
products required, and they see fit to devote
more than 50 per cent of their production to
concentrated milk products, cheese, ice cream
and plastics, because they provide a more
profitable market than butter does, they should
not expect the government and the people of
Canada to tolerate the prohibition of a wholesome food in order to protect a market which
at some time they might want to fall back on.
The poorer families in Canada find that the
price of butter is beyond their ability to pay,
and that because of the ban against oleomargarine they are unable to get a suitable,
wholesome substitute.
If we balance this question we find that the
situation before us is not the result of failure
on the part of the farmers and dairymen to
produce every ounce of milk possible to meet

SENATE

the demand for butter-I emphasize that that
is flot the situation at aillbut rather biecause there are a number of markets in w'hich
they can dispose of their product and they
choose the one that is most advantageous to
them. No person will criticize them for that.
But when tbey have made their choice it
should bie open to the people of Canada to
have available to thons a substitute te replace
the article that has become scarce by reason
of that choice.
If we wish to discuss thîs inatter sincereiy
and logically we must consider the underlying
principle. I say the principle is bigger and
broader than the question of whether butter
prices are bigh or low or the supply of fats
and euls ahundant or meagre. The principle
cxists xxhether butter ýprices are high or low;
wbtzther fats~ and ojîs are plentiful or scarce.
Is it fair, liberal and democratic to maintain
a prohibition ngainst the manufacture of a
nourishing article of food in Canada, and to
gix e an exclusive monopoly in that field to
one clasc of people? This seems to me to be
the real question, and the principle it involves
lias dictated my approach to the problem and
iaflucnced my decision to -vote in fax our of the
bill.
Lot me now refer to one or two other
matters. A great deal was said the other day
about the fats and oils situation, and we wcre
asked to accept the baid statement tbat if wve
increase our domestie or indigenous production
of fats and ojî.s our international allocation
will libe corrcspondingly reduced. That statement does not take into account ail the oiemonts of the situation. Tbere is no doubt
that under the ters of allocation, Canada, in
common with every country which is a member of the International Food Committee, is
required to confors to tbe foliowing procedure.
Eacb country mnust ostimate the amount of its
requirements in fats and oius, compute the
volume of its indigenous production, and file
with tbe committee a roquisition or requirement for the difference. It hias to justify both
the amount of the difference and the extent
of its over-ail requirements. When the coinmittee meets. it finds that some countries have
a surplus of fats and cils, and others bave a
shortage. But the total surplus is less tban
sufficient, to take rare of the accumulated
shortages, so the counitrios whose supplies are
deficient receive ioss than 100 per cent of their
requirensents.
Now, to the extent that w'e in Canada
increase our own production of fats and oils
and retain thesn for our own use, we lean iess
and are enabied to draw less upon the international pooî. To the extent that we have
to look to the pool for allocations to meet

our requirements, we are subject to a
reduction of the amount requisitioned; but
there is nothing in our externai reiationships,
nothing in tbe regulations geverning international allocations, to prevent, Canada from
growing more rape seed, more sunfiower seed,
more soya beans, or reoovering frons then
additionai nuls and appiying thens to, whatever
domestic uses we desire. The oniy thing that
we cannot do without figbting our case further
before the committee is to increase our
demanda upon the pool by creating new uses
for our fats and ouas. But there is nothing to
prevent uis from rodistributing or realioeating
to new uses our requirements, estimated upon
tise 1941-42 hasis. I sax-. therefore, that it is
hegging the question to dismias oleonsargarine
frons consideration because fats and nuls are
not available internationaiiy.
It lies within
our power to reallocate distribution within
Canada, and to see tbat our butter deficiency
is made up througbi a suppiy of oleomargarine.
In this way we could meet tbe needs of these
chldren of w-bon we Ïhave beard, and of poor
families for whom butter in any appreciabie
quaotity is not available. In anvthing I have
said I am not taking a position against tise
farier. If I believç d titat in tise long rua

But 1 ans firmly
cutivinced tiiet that is itut te case.
Hon. Mr. McDONÂLD (King's): Thiat is
because you do not know.
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: I t.lank my hionourable friend for lis rensark. Tisere are man-,
ways of net knowiisg. We may have coloured
glass in our spectacles andi oniy see a situation
tisrougls tbat coloured msedium. I make no
daim to ho a farmer, altisougi I served my
poriod of apprenticeship on the farm, and even

I amn not unequipped to discuss practicai politics in relation te farm operations.
Hoxex or, I ans net discussing the question
frons tîsat point of view.
My bonourahie
friend frons King's (Hon. Mr. McDonaid)
suggests tbat if I knew more about farmiîtg
I would hoe opposed te tbis bill. I aýýk bis,
wlsy? Ia 1947, according te the figures for
that yoar, farinera produced and soid over
17 billion pounds of milk. Some 8 billion
pounds of that production were used in the
manufacture of butLter.
How, thon, when
the farmer and the dairy producer deliberately choose te divert or distribute their milk
to more profitable channels, can it hoe said
that you wiii ho doing anything to hurt the
îndustry if you make availahie to tbe people

MAY 4, 1948
of Canada a wholesome and nutritious substitute for butter? It is clear that butter is
not being produced in proportion to the
capacity of Canada's milk production.
Right Hon. Mr. MACKENZIE: Would
my honourable friend mind repeating those
figures?
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: I said that milk production in Canada in 1947 was over 17
billion pounds, and that the quantity which
went into butter production was a little over
8 billion pounds.
Once we permit our viewpoint to be
influenced by local or by emo-tional considerations in the supposed interests of
friends or associates engaged in agriculture,
we are exposed to this type of one-sided
argument. As much as my honourable
friend, or any other senator, I am firmly
actuated by regard for the best interests of
all our people, including the farmers; but
I say in all sincerity that, confronted with
the facts I have presented, and giving them
their due weight, I must support .the bill.
The price of butter is high, although I do not
say it is too high. At times the supply is
insufficient to satisfy the demand, and many
,people are unable to get this nourishing
article of food. On the other hand there is a
tremendous difference between the amount
of milk produced and the quantity of butter
production. Under these circumstances it is
not unfair to any person, and specifically
the dairy producer and the farmer, to remove
this long-standing prohibition, this discrimination against the many in the interests of
the few. It is time we got away from that
sort of thing.
In this connection, several arguments were
advanced by the honourable senator from
De Salaberry (Hon. Mr. Gouin). One was
that if this bill were passed the general
market would be demoralized. Another was
that there is no use passing it, because the
necessary supplies of fats and oils would -not
be available until 1950 or 1951. In the third
place, the honourable gentleman stated that
he was in favour of oleomargarine, and he
wept for the undernourished children of the
slums; but he was opposed to the bill
because its passage would not enable 'them to
get any oleomargarine at the present time.
I say, on the contrary, that we can get
oleomargarine as soon as this bill is passed.
Hon. Mr. DUPUIS: When?
Hon. Mr. EULER: In three weeks, easily.

435

Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: I say to my friend
that it is a simple matter. In the first place,
the oils are available.
Hon. Mr. DUPUIS: Where?
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: The oils are available from our domestic production. It simply
would be necessary, as my honourable friend
would have known if he had been following me
a little earlier, to redistribute some of the
present allocations in Canada. For instance,
we could make less pie, pie crust and cake,
and maybe a little more oleomargarine.
Hon. J. A. McDONALD: May I suggest
that the children might prefer their fats in the
form of cakes and pies?
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: My honourable friend
is now becoming an expert in speaking on
behalf of the children of Canada. First of all
it was the farmers that he was interested in.
Maybe in time he will develop -an interest for
the people as a whole. Now we are told that
the children of Canada do not need butter,
that maybe they would prefer their fats in
other forms.
Hon. Mr. MacLENNAN: He did not say
that. You need not go that far.
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: I am not attributing
that remark to my honourable friend from
Kings; I am referring to a contention that is
made. If my friend does not like my statements, I presume he can ask questions.
Hon. Mr. MacLENNAN: Well, I will ask
a question right now. When did those who are
in favour of this bill become so interested in
the widows and orphans of Canada?
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: I may be permitted to
answer my honourable friend in kind. I suppose he has developed interests and changed
his opinions from time to time, and he would
no doubt admit that the labourer who came to
the vineyard at the eleventh hour got as much
as the one who worked all day. I do not
think it matters when anyone became interested in the children of Canada, or in the
farmers of Canada. I am discussing this thing
as a matter of principle, and I am placing certain facts before the house. It seems to me
that any person who cannot add these facts
together and get the results I suggest, must be
looking at the matter through coloured glasses.
Hon. Mr. MacLENNAN: My opinion is
that you are not so much interested in the
children as you pretend to be.
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: My honourable friend
is of course violating one of the rules of the
house by interrupting in this way.

SENATE

Right Hon. Mr. MACKENZIE:

May

I

Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: By all means.
Right Hon. Mr. MACKENZIE: My honourable friend stated that an increase in the
indigenous production in Canada would not
affect the quantities allocated to us by the
International Emergency Food Committee.
I wonder if he would mind explaining why?
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: First of all, I did not
say that. I said exactly the opposite. I said
we increased our
that to the extent tat
indigenous production of fats and oils in Canada, our leaning on the international pool
would be less. But I did point out that if
we produced more in Canada we could keep
it all, whereas when we draw an allocation
from the international pool we get only a
percentage of the requirements for which we
file an application.
Right Hon. Mr. MACKENZIE: May I now
ask a supplementary question? What guarantee is my honourable friend prepared to give
to the house as to the practicability of
increased domestic production within the next
twelve months?
Hon. Mr. QUINN: The senator from Thunder Bay (Hon. Mr. Paterson) told us about
that the other day.
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: There are two answers to that question. One is that we can
increase our production of odible oils from
such sources as sunflower seeds and soya beans,
amd by refining various oil-bearing seeds that
are by-products of the grain elevators and
have so far been exported to the United States,
where they are processed. We are told that
this refining process will be carried on in
Canada shortly. The second means is an
inmediate re-allocation of the fats and oils in
Canada, by assigning semo portion of them to
margarine and reducing the quotas for other
products.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: May I ask the honourable senator what percentage of our demands
w-e got in the last three years?
Hon. Mr. HOWARD:
per cent.

Between 50 and 60

Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: I would be making the
wildest guess if I attempted to answer that.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I thought you knew.
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: No. I tried to get
that information. I asked the Administrator
of Fats and Oils for it, and even the Canadian
representative on the International Emergency
Food Committee, but without success. I should

think it would range anywhere from 50 to
70 per cent of the requirement for whic we
filed application. Apparently there were too
many variables fer these officials to be able
to give me the figure.
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: May I interrupt? I
have here the report of the International
Energency Food Committee, dated March
1918. The paragraph relating to Canada says:
The recommended allocation provides for exports in 1948 at about pre-war tonnage level.
lowever, the Canadian inport allocation is
,0000

tous

below

the

pre-war

average

of

149,000 tons.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: But how much did we
apply for?
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: It goes on to say:
This was partly compensatcd for by an increase in indigenous production in 1947 to
265,000 tons, as conpared with 226.000 tons in
pre-war years. Livestock fat production in 1948
is expected to (ecline by 15,000 to 20.000 tons,
as compared w ith last year. Linseed production, on the other hand, will probably be main-

tained at the 1947 level. Total visible fat
consomption of 55 pounrds per capita in 1947
was 80 per cent of that of pre-w ar.
It would appear that the import allocation
of 79,000 tons is about equal to the quantity
applied for.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: That is what I thought.
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: About 80,000 tons.
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: The allocation tliat
w-e hope, to gît this year is between 80,000
and 85,000 tons.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Tien we got pretty
nearly 100 per cent of our application last
year?
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: I cannot say.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: That .is indicated by the
figures.

Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: I am in the middle
of a sentence. Howcver, go ahead.
Hon. Mr. BOUFFARD: I am sorry. I just
wanted to ask my honourable friend if he
could suggest wliere the oils and fats w-ould
be taken from for the manufacture of olcomargarine.
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: The history of the
manufacture of margarine in the United
States is this, that as they proceeded with that
manufacture they produced less domestie

MAY 4, 1948

shortening, the reason being that margarine
is a dual-purpose food, in that it can be
used for cooking and also in substitution for
butter as a spread on bread. My honourable
friend wants to know from where we would
take the fats and oils for the manufacture of
margarine. What can I do better than to
suggest to him what was suggested the other
day by our leader (Hon. Mr. Robertson),
when lie pictured 3,000 bakers across Canada
weeping because, if the manufacture of
margarine were legalized, they would have
less edible oils and fats for making pies,
cakes and other confections. There are many
places and many products in Canada from
which we could take fats at present, in order
to get started on the manufacture of
margarine. And we could increase our indigenous production of edible fats and oils. The
combination of the two methods would make
an excellent program under whioh we could
embark on the production of oleomargarine.
But first of all, there has to be a change in
the law in order that the production may be
legalized.
Right Hon. Mr. MACKENZIE: Would my
honourable friend permit me to quote a statement from the British government?
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: No. My right honourable friend can make a speech.
Right Hon. Mr. MACKENZIE: And probably will.
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: There is no use hav.ing
speeches wiýthin speeches.
Right Hon. Mr. MACKENZIE: It is a
complete contradiction of what you have
been saying.
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: That is a matter of
opinion.
There is only one other question I wish to
discuss, namely, the constitutionality of the
ban on margarine. Perhaps that does not
matter a great deal to the Senate, although it
is supposed to be the body chiefly concerned
in seeing to it that we do not have unconstitutional laws or on our statute books. The law
providing for this prohibition, as originally enacted, was based upon a consideration of
health, and the preamble to the act so recited.
At the present time the proof that margarine
is a wholesome and nutritious article of food
is strong enough to meet any case which one
might attempt to make on the ground that its
use would be injurious to the national health
of Canada. There is no other basis upon
which the federal authorities can control the
manufacture of oleomargarine. The question
today falls, therefore, under the heading of
property and civil rights within the provinces.

For what it is worth, I say-and honourable
senators can pay attention to my opinion or
disregard it-that if this statute is ever
qu'estioned on the ground of being ultra vires,
I am firmly convinced that it will be so held.
Before closing, may I refer to the action
recently taken in the United States as to taxes
and imposts piled upon those who dared to
operate in the field of the manufacture and sale
of oleomargarine? In that country there have
been taxes on manufacturers, wholesalers and
retailers. By a recent act of Congress-and it
is expected that the Senate will concur-the
taxes have been removed. I wish to read from
an article dated Washington, April 29, which
in part is as follows:
The federal taxes which the bill passed yesterday would repeal are: 10 cents a pound on
coloured oleo; j cent a pound on uncoloured;
$600 a year tax on manufacturers; $480 on
wholesalers of coloured oleo; $2,00 on wholesalers of the uncoloured products; $48 on retailers of coloured oleo; $6 on retailers of
uncoloured.
The dairy industry, naturally, has put up
quite a fight over this question, but the reports
have it that the contest is not nearly as bitter
or strenuous as it was in earlier years.
It has been proven that the farmer is a
resourceful person. The problem of securing
edible oils for the manufacture of oleomargarine is one of growing suitable products. The
farmers, therefore, have turned more and more
to the production .of cottonseed, cornflower
seed and the soy bean. As these crops have
increased the farmers' incomes have swelled.
In the United States the farmer has been sufficiently resourceful to adapt himself to the new
situation by producing his share of the products
which go into the manufacture of a substitute
being sold in competition with butter. It must
be remembered, too, that oleomargarine contains 20 per cent skim milk.
On the question of resourcefulness of farmers
I would refer honourable senators to the Canada
Year Book, 1947, at page 356. The information
I shall give shows that the farmer is not frozen
in the matter of having to produce milk. In
the year 1945 production of various dairy
products reached its peak; in 1946 it was lower
by about 800 million pounds, and in 1947 it was
about 500 million pounds less. To show the
resourceful and ingenious nature of the farmer
in relation to dairying I shall read the following
extract from the Canada Year Book:
During the six-year period, 1939 to 1945, milk
production increased approximately 1,800,000,000 pounds, and the industry as a whole made
an immense contribution to the food supplies of
both Canada and the United Kingdom. After
the collapse of Germany in May, 1945, production suffered from a reactionary development
which became more pronounced after the final

SENATE

cessation of hostilities in August. The retreat
fromn dairying in the Prairie Provinces folioing the bountiful harvest cf 19-44 with higher
prices p.aid for grain and live stock, and the
cumulative effects of the labour shortage, al
played a part in halting the upwvard swing in
dairy ing production in the weste~rn domnain.
I arn not critical of the farmer; I only cite
that extract to show his ability to shift and
turn to meet the demand. If that is the situation, it rail be no bardsbip on the farmer te
permit the manufacture of oleomargarine in
Canada, particularly when lie has chosen to
direct less than 50 per cent of bis milk products to the manufacture of butter.
I kno-w that more then ever bcfore the
people of Canada arc in favour of the naufacture and sale cf oleomiargarine. I would
point te the city of Toronto, with its large
manufacturing intcrcsts and ucîllknown conservate views-more conservative than one
of niy persuasion likes to see. XVe find the
council of that city adopting aad suppecticg
a resolution passed by the city council cf
Brantford,. asking that the ban on the sale
of cleomnargarine bie remox cd.
Surely that
indicates a1 broadening in the thinking of the
people of Canada.
Onr' bas enîy ta look at the figures te realize
that tlu re is netbîng in this bill wbic-i tlireatens

For tbese reasons 1 arni supporting tbe bill.
Hon. S. S. MeKEEN: Honcurable senators,
I dIo oct Ibink Ihat the speakers for and
against, this bill are lbe oalv 0ncr wbc bave
tlie welfare cf ori cbildrcn at'heart. This is not
a question of the dairy farmer versus the consumler as nuucb as it is cnc of the dairv farmer
against the petential producer cf margarine. I
think tbe last speaker empbiasized that peint
obhen hoe referred te the discrimination against
the margaine producer.
It seerns te rmc that clîr conceru is tbat our
eh.ildren bave a propcrly balanced diet. Il

must be remcrnbered that butter is only one
part of Ibeir diet whicb cornes froro the dairy
industry. The most important product which
cornes from. Ibis source is fiuid milk, and if
wveare 10 bave sufficient fluid milk the year
around Ibere is bound to be a surplus in the
summertirne, and tbat is wben the butter is
made. My information is Ibat production is as
follows: Butter, about 73 per cent in summer,
and 27 per cent in wicter; cheese. about 85 per
cent in soimmer. and 15 per cent in winter; ice
crearo, about 70 per cent in summer and 30
per cent in winter.
Truc, tbe farmer is a resoureeful man. H1e
builds up wvbat I cail bis by-products in the
seasen wxhen there is a surplus. ln order le
suppiy sufficient fluid rniik in the winter, the
cows bave te be fed. Tbey cannot go out
to graze. as lhey can in New Zealand. Therefore there must ho a large surplus in the suromertirne if the flid milk market is te be
supplied in the winter.
As far as lthe dairy producer is ccnccrned,
hie bias donc a fairiy geod job fer this country.
I biave net heard any figures frorn prorneters
of Ibis measure te show tbat our cbildren bave
net bad sofficient butter.
Exarnining the
figtures for the Uiiited States, wbere margarine
us scid, I find that wbetber or net because of
the intreduction of margarine-Ibo per capita
consumptien cf butter is enly eleven pounds
as against twenîy-eight poîînds in Canada; and
the consomption of margarine in the United
,States is cniy 4-2 pouuids per head. So the
per capila censuimption in Ibat ceuntry cf
butter and margarine comhincd is just about
baîf the per capita censumplion cf butter in
Canada. It wouid appear that those wbo bave
shecd ail thcsc Lcars because Canadians have
insufficient butter te spread on tbcir bread
bave net preved their case. As regards taking
euls and fats frem slîcrtcning and other items
of ccnsumaptien, this wouid net increase in the
least te country7s supplv of cils and fats.
The yoiiugsters arc getting thein in their
food now.
These wbo support Ibis measure base tbeir
arguments on prcviding a spread fer bread.
Tbc way to encourage a bigh production cf
fiuid rnilk and a larger production cf butter
is te enatîre the producer a fair price for bis
predrîcl. The month cf lowest production as
far as butter is concerned is April; peak production returns in May. I believe the shortage for Ibis year is ever. Yesterday I made
inqtîiries and fond Ibat I could gel butter in
eveiy store I wcnt te.

Hon. Mr. LACASSE: But flot in Windsor.

MAY 4,1948
Hon. Mr. McKEEN: Maybe flot. But I
went to several stores in Ottawa.
Hon. Mr. DUPUIS: Was the honourable
senator from Essex (Hon. Mr. Lacasse) trying
to buy butter on Sunday?
Hon. Mr. MeKEEN: It seems to me that
the main object of the bill, although it is
commended to us as being for the good of our
children, is to establish in this country a new
industry, one which may disrupt an existing
industry to the prejudice of some 400,000 of
our farmers. There are probably nlot more
than five or six potential producers of margarine. The interests of the consumers in this
country are being fairly well looked after as
far as the production of butter is concerned,
because only one country in the world-NeNv
Zealand, whicb consumes 30 pounds per capita
-has a larger consumption than ours.
If the case for margarine rests on a supposedly inadequate supply of butter, I think
Canadians are well taken care of. If the
question is one of price, it would seem logical
that those who are assumned to be making a
case for the consumer would object to the cost
of butter. They suggest that margarine could
be sold here at 40 cents a pound, and that a
plentiful supply could be had. Butter can be
bought and landed in this country at 38 cents
a pound; but supporters of the bill do not lay
stress on obtaining it cheaply, so their primary
concern does not seemn to be to increase the
consumption of butter.
Hon. Mr. EULER: Where can butter be
bought at 38 cents a pound? From what
country?
Hon. Mr. MeKEEN: Last year we bought
butter from New Zealand and landed it at 38
cents a pound.
Hon. Mr. EULER: Tbat was last year.
You cannot buy it fromn New Zealand at tbat
price this year.
Hon. Mr. MeKEEN: This year butter was
bougbt at 33 cents a pound.
Hon. Mr. EULER: By whom?
'Bon. Mr. MeKEEN: By England.
Hon. Mr. EULER: By England, yes; but
England is not Canada.
Hon. Mr. MeKEEN: If you had put in an
order for it you could have got it.
Hon. Mr. EULER: You cannot get it at any
stores bere.
Hlon. Mr. LAMBERT: Is my bonourable
friend aware that butter from. New Zealand
was diverted, by request, from England? It
was net the resuit of a direct order.
5853-30

Hon. Mr. McKEEN: That is right. But
what I arn trying to point out is that if wbat my
friends are concerned about is the probhema of
getting supplies to the consumer, the best
answer would be to obtain butter at a hower
price, nut to encourage tbe manufacture of
margarine, because if butter and margarine
were the same price the mai ority would prefer
butter. In the United States, wbere both can
be had, butter is generally chosen.
I believe tbat the passage of this bill
wouhd do a great deal of barma and very littie
good. I do not tbink the real question at
issue is wbetber we should or should flot
Tbe underhying
margarine.
manufacture
principle is the greatest good for the greatest
number, and upon that basis there is a sound
case for the dýairy industry.
Hon. Mr. CAMPBELL: May I ask my
honourable friend whv he foresees that tbe
elimination of the prohibition w*ouhd do s0
much harm to the dairy industry in Canada, if
he cannot point to any harm wbich the pro.duction of margarine bas done to dairying in
other countries.
Hon. Mr. McKEEN: I ar n ot trying to protect the dairy industry. I want to protect the
people of Canada, the consumers. It is my
contention that, if margarine were rpermitted
and the price of butter were reduced, the
price of fluid mihk would be increased. By
anahogy, the situation is the sam as one we
have in British Columbia. A log costs, maybe,
$30 per thousand. It does not matter what
price the milis get for two-by-fours and shiphap; what does matter is the price for the whohe
have to seli one part of the log for
log. If w~e
$15 or $20 per thousand, naturally the price of
the other produets of the lumber goes up. If
you cut the price of butter you will raise the
price of fluid milk, and I tbink that tbe mihk
is more important for the welfare of our chuldren than is the butter itself.
Hon. 'NORMAN P. LAMBERT: Honour-able senators, in view of the fact that I also
bave had tbe privilege in the past two years
of supporting a measure similar to this one,
my re-m-arks today must necessarily be in the
form of summarizing some of the main points
that have arisen during the debate and wbicb
-appeal to me as b-aving a hogical and direct
bearing upon the issue.
I base my support of this bill on tbree main
considerations.
In the first place, I think thýat it is economieahhy sound -and in tbe best interests of the
country as a whohe. In saying tbat it is
economieally sound I have, I believe. a full
appreciation of its effect upon the dairy
industry as well as upon ail other industrial

SENATE

and business activities in this country. Contrary to representations which bav e been
made by members of the organizcd dairy
industry, and by others in parliarnunt, regarding the evii effects of lifting the ban on oleo,
.it is my opinion that t.he cernovai oi the ban
would flot injure this industrv in any degree,
but, on tie contrary, would hip it, arid woutd
hclp it largely as the cesuit of îuany indirect
atixantages which xvould corne to the coinrnunitv as a wvhoie.
Last year I placed upon Iloîseccl the figures
of production of the dairy îndustcy over a
period nf twenty-fix e yuars, and showed
definituiy tbat production of basic whole rnilk
hiad greatiy incruasud. That is the index, and
the only sound index, of the atatus of the
dairy rndustcy. The figures aiso showcd an
increase in the production of a wide variety
of hy-prodacts, including butter, which flow
fcoma the activitics ni the dairy farmas anti
crcarncries ni Canada; andi if they sliowed
one tiîing more iban another, b. was tbat the
dairy cow ducs not live by butter atone.
Judging irom statements t.b-at hav e been
made buere, one would think that ait tbe rniik
produced by cvury eow xvcnt into the rnaking
of bttec. Otuonsargarine is a subst itute for
btter atone. It is nlot a substittil co

national Emergency Food Committee and its
subcommittee on fats and oils. I have nothing
but the greatest of praise for those who have
international
with
the
been
concerned
rationalization of those commodities during
the war and the years immediately following.
The F.A.O. like the I.T.O., is an emanation
from the United Nations charter, and its
specialized agencies were set uip for the purpose of trying to rationalize a disrupted and
The
very difficult international situation.
International Trade Organization has sought
to find a solution to these problems through
its work at Geneva and Havana, and the
F.A.O. has sought to make foods available to
the countries of Europe in order to save
them from complete starvation and degradation.
The distribution of fats and oils is just
one feature of the work undertaken by the
Emergency Food Organization, but it is entirely wrong to conclude from its existence
and administration that something rigid, restrictive and negative comes from it. The
fact is, and the figures show, that the supplies of edible fats and oils-which are in the
general category of fats and oils apart from
butter-have increased during the last two
or three years. To my way of thinking these
increases have been remarkable in view of
the dislocation that occurred during the war
in the great areas that formerly supplied the
world with most of its edible oils. In this
connection one has only to mention that in
pre-war days Manchuria and India and Ceylon
alone supplied the world with over half of
its suppy of edible oils. The shifting sources
of supply following the war should be very
definitely borne in mind when discussing the
application of available supplies in relation
to the problem we have in Canada. Whereas
Manchuria and Indi.a and Ceylon supplied
most of the oils before the war, increases
are now 'taking place in the Philippines-which
are associated with the United States in a
compaign-and also in South America and
Africa. The British are making large capital
investments in British East Africa and West
Africa, and are being assisted by the experts
of that great private corporation, Lever
Brothers, who are associated with the fats
an.d oils organization.
Supplies are becoming more available, and
the figures in this report show that Great
Britain today, except for butter, bas even
more fats and oils than she had before the war.
In European countries where the consumption
of fats and oils and nourishment of that nature
was low before the war, the available supply
today is practically equal to that of pre-war
5853-301

days. I think that brings us to the definite
conclusion that any measure which will enable
a country like Canada to increase its supply
of the edible oils needed for the manufacture
of oleomargarine, will be of benefit not only
to Canadians who cannot afford butter, but
to the world in general. I am convinced from
reading this report that in a very short time,
perhaps in another year, the total production
of fats and oils required for distribution where
it is most needed will not be far behind that
of the pre-war year of 1939. Let me emphasize that by removing the ban on the manufacture and importation of oleomargarine, we
are really stimulating production and taking a
step towards increasing of trade not only
between this country and the United States,
but be.tween this country and the other
countries of the world. In contrast with the
negative character of much of our legislation
since the war ended, this is a positive step
forward. I do not know of any other country
in the world that requires more positive trade
and financial policies than we do if we are to
carry on, develop and grow, and bear the burdens of taxation that we incurred during the
last war.
Third, and lastly, I support this bill because
it is based upon the common interests of all
the people of this country and not upon those
of any single class or group.
Therefore
it is consistent with the purpose of a representative parliament functioning in a representative and democratic state, which should
be based upon the interests of the greatest
number of its people. I may say, in passing,
that I am strongly opposed to the increasing
tendency that we have seen in the last two
years to favourably regard legislation coming
into ýthis parliament because it has been asked
for and pressed for by some organized body
such as the wheat pool, the Federation of
Agriculture, the organized dairy industry, the
Canadian Manufacturers Association or organized labour. There is a limit to the strength
of our constitutional machinery, and its very
framework is based upon the ability of people,
regardless of class, to approach the state. If
we load this machinery with too great a
demand from this group or that, I do not
think our system of government can withstand the pressure any more than did those
of Europe.
I do not expect those gentlemen who are
opposing this legislation to take any advice or
suggestion from me when I refer to political
expediency or party consideration, although
there was a time when some of them, I think,
were quite willing to listen to me. But that
time bas long since passed. Parties and

SENATE

poiitics are really only a means to, an end.
That remark does flot originate with me. I
heard a very eminent cabinet ministor make
that very statoment over the radio within the
last two months-and I agreed with him. If
wc are going to deal with our probloms on any
basis of narrow politicai expediency, we wili
defeat the very purpose for which we are hore.
Party poiicy, in the long run, should be based
upon the best interests of the people, regardless of class, creod or religion. Only in that
way can the liberty anti frecdom associateti
with our systcm of government be preservoti
in this or in any other country.
Hon. FELIX P. QUINN: Honourable senators, I promise I will not tictain you very
long. As it ivas not my intention to speak, I
have no notes or .prepaicd tex[.
I was very moch impressedt hy the sýpeech of
the honourable gentleman from Toronto (Hon.
Mr. Haydcn), and I must congratulate him
upon it. I thought he answored the crities of
the bill very weIl, especialiy those who stateti
that even if ixe removed the ban on the manufacture, import and sale of oleomargarine, we
could not secure the fats and oiis nccessary to
produce that eommodity.
While the honourable gentleman was speak-ing questions wero directeti to him from two
or* thirce sections of the chamber as tc where
Canada would secure the necessary ingredients
if the ban were lifted. I sohînit that quite a
number of memibers coulti not have listened
carefully 10 the speech matie recently hy the
honourable gentleman from Thunder Bay
(lon. Mr. Paterson), for hie made that point
quite clear in these words:
In cleaning wheat at the heati cf the lakes
we take out wced seetis, many cf thein oitbearing. Ihere are over 400 varieties cf w ild
mustaîti. The bail niustardt is full of cil,' anti
for years we have been seliing our seetis as
screonings to the Unitedi States, whcere they
separate the varions seeds.
Lately we have donc sonie of the selectiag
by new, improved m.achinery, anti have shipped
thousantis cf tons of bail niîstard to Dlut1~h
anti Mîfnneapolis. where it is ertisheti anti processet inlto olive oil andi other edileI o il
Oneo
hundrîeti thousand tons equals 200 million
pountis; anti if hiaif cf that is cil, we have 100
million pountis. In aboat a mionth a plant will
start running at Fort William te inake the oil
there.
Since that speech was matie I have learneti
on goti authority that cargoos cf edibie cils
have been shipped through the port cf Halifax
to another country for use in the manufacture
of margarine. I think that is sufficient answer
to the argument that we cannot get the nocessarv ingredients.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: Were those oils manufacturoti or pretioccd in Canada?

Hon. Mr. QUINN: They were prodoceti in
Canada.
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN:

In Toronto.

Hon. Mr. QUIN',N: There were cargoes cf

Hon. Mr. EULER: No doubt, about that.
Hcn. Mr. QUINN: My information came
frona a most roliabie newspapor, dated May 1.
Hen. Mr. EULER: There is no doubt that
fi is correct.

Hon. Mr. QUINN: That can be prcved by
the mon who worked at the watcrfront andi
liantiiot the cargoes.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: Thae stevedores.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: Was that cil siaippeti tc

Hon. Mr. QUINN: I cannot say whcether

Hen. Mr. EULER: It is going to other

MAY 4, 1948
I have heard a good deal today about the
chjîdren, but very littie about the women of
this country. I do flot know of one women's
organization across Canada which bas flot
passed a resolution asking for the lifting of
the ban on margarine.
Hon. Mr. LEGER: They are ail from the
cities.
Hon. Mr. QUINN: But we should listen to
the voices of women. Personally, I arn going
to stay with them, and support what they are
dernanding.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. QUINN: I arn gomng to vote for
this bill.
While the senator front Toronto (Hon. Mr.
Hayden) was speaking this afternoon, my hionourable friend from King's (Hon. Mr.
McDonald) made a remark whjch rather surprised me. He suggested that perhaps the
children would prefer pies to butter. I renentber that a very farnous qucen some years ago
said sometbing along that line, and it bas
often been quoted since. I should very much
dislike having that rernark of rny very close
friend appear on Hansard. I hope it will be
elirninated.
Hon. Mr. LEGER: The people you refer
to were asking for bread.
Hon. Mr. QUINN: Now we are asking for
butter. The two commodities are closely
related.

Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: Where are the irndernourished children that the member frorn
Inkerman (Hon. Mr. Hugessen) told us about?
Hon. Mr. QUINN: The honourable gentlemian from Vancouver (Hon. Mr. McKeen)
said that hie knew of no place where butter
could not be purchased. I could not buy a
pound of butter in rny city, and I left home
only two weeks ago.
Hon. Mr. McKEEN: My statement was
that I could buy it here. I arn not familiar
with the situation elsewhere.
Hon. Mr. QUINN: There has been difficul-ty
in securing butter in Halifax ail winter. One
shiprnent came to Nova Scotia which the
Attorney General of that province said was
unfit for human consumption. I arn told that
it came frorn Saskatchewan and that it was
flavoured with garlie.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Oh, oh!
Hon. Mr. QUINN: I understand that a
good deal of our butter cornes frorn that province. As I say, in Nova Scotia we do not produce sufficient to meet our dernands. Until
the dairyrnen of this country show me that
they can produce sufficient butter to meet the
dernands of the -people, I arn ini favour of this
bill.

READING-NIOTION

NEGATIVED

The Sonate resumcd from yesterday the
adjourned debate on the motion of Hon. Mr.
Euler for the seconding readiug of Bill B, an
Act to amend the Dairy Industry Act.
Hon. CAIRINE R. WILSON: Honourable
senators, unfortunately I have not heard ail
of the rnany speeches which have been
delivered an this question, but there is one
point to whichi I should like to draw your
attention. and te which I do flot believe any
previaus speaker has refcrrcd. The honourable
leader on this sida (Hon. Mr. Robertson) dwelt
upon the short supply of fats and ails available for consumption in the world, but I do
flot think ho discussed the great cffort which
is heing miade by the British geverument te
increase this supply, and the gigantie plans for
the growing of poanuts in Africa. It is my
understanding that prier te 1939 \ve did not
manufacture one once of refined ced livor ail
in Canada, but were cntircly dependent upon
Britain and Norway for our supplies, some of
whielï came te us via the United States. Following that turne we produced in Canada onl '
25 per (ent of the cod liver ail rcquirrd for
otliur than edible puiposes. but now Canada is
able te icect ail ils~ own neails in this direction,
and I believe aur praduet is of a sulperior
quality.

my esteemed friend frein Waterloo of the
oppertunity ta conclude the debate which ho

MAY 5, 1948

As a newcomer here I regret exceedingly
the sharp cleavage of opinion in this assembly
upon this important public issue, and I am
sincerely sorry that my honourable friend did
not ask this house to do what it has done so
ably with other public issues, namely, inquire
into the whole situation. I say that especially
because my honourable friend was with me a
member of the House of Commons when, in
March 1934, Bill No. 38, an Act to amend the
Dairy Industry Act, was introduced in that
chamber by Mr. Weir, the then Minister of
Agriculture in the government of the Right
Honourable R. B. Bennett. First reading was
given to the bill without opposition. And later
when it came up for second reading-the
honourable gentleman from Churchill (Hon.
Mr. Crerar) was also there then-no opposition was expressed to the principle of the bill.
I find that on April 17, 1934, Mr. Weir said
that the object of the bill was:
-simply to prevent the substitution of minera]
oil in products that would come into competition with butter.
And again on that day, as reported at page
2223 of Hansard:
It is intended also to prevent the manufacture of or the entry into this country of prodaets whieh will be in competition with those of
dairy producers.
In all kindness to my honourable friend
from Waterloo, for whom I have the greatest
admiration, I must say that I have no recollection of his having raised his voice during the
years 1930 to 1935 in support of this margarine
issue, which is now deemed so important by
him and by the honourable senator fron
Toronto (Hon. Mr. Hayden), who spoke here
yesterday.
I have browsed back through the musty
records, and I find that in 1940 an order in
couneil was passed by the Liberal government
of that day-of which I was a humble member
-dealing with the basic features contained in
the report of the I.E.F.C., which has been
discussed in this house. The presiding officer
who signed that order in council was tbe
present Prime Minister of Canada.
Hon. Mr. EULER: What was the date of it?
I have
Right Hon. Mr. MACKENZIE:
not the exact date before me, but I shall see
that my friend gets it before he speaks.
In 1941 another order in council dealing with
that subject was passed by the same Liberal
administration. The senior member of the
cabinet present at that meeeting was the
honourable gentleman fron Churchill (Hon.
Mr. Crerar), and he signed and recommended
to His Excellency the Governor General an
order in council having to do with the world

supply of fats and oils, which is the basis of
the worldi agreement upon which we on this
side of the house support our argument against
the bill.
Hon. Mr. CRERAR: That has nothing to
do with the present bill.
Right Hon. Mr. MACKENZIE: My honourable friend has a peculiar capacity for placing his own interpretation on matters. There
is on that order in council the firm signature
of one "T. A. Crerar", then Minister of Mines
and Resources for the Dominion of Canada.
There we have an account of the action
taken in 1934, 1940 and 1941. Why, all of a
sudden, should there develop this remarkable
interest-which seems peculiar to the city of
Toronto-in the consumers and poor people?
I do not wish to be personal, but the grandfather of the present Prime Minister said:
In my youth were poverty and adversity my
constant companions.
I take second place to no man or woman in
this house with respect to what I regard as the
best interests of the consurners of Canada. I
ask my honourable friend even now that this
unfortunate, bitter controversy, this rnpolitical group issue, be turned in such direction that the combined talents of every party
represented here can be devoted to the solution of this important question which now
disturbs the public mind of Canada.
I have given some time to the study of the
comprehensive reports of the I.E.F.C., and
have made a digest of them. I wish to take
this opportunity of extending my personal
congratulations and felicitations to the honourable leader in this house (Hon. Mr. Robertson) for his comprehensive and painstaking
review of the entire fats and oils situation. He
was the only one in this house, with the
exception of my honourable friend from
Ottawa (Hon. Mr. Lambert), who gave a comprehensive survey of the I.E.F.C. report. Statements made the other day by the honourable
member from Thunder Bay (Hon. Mr. Paterson), when unfortunately I was absent, cannot be sustained by the facts. I make that
assertion after having discussed them in an
entirely non-partisan way with competent
authorities. Of the speakers who have supported the drastic action involved in the
second reading of this bill-a "yes-or-no, takeit-or-leave-it" attitude-not one has been able
to produce proof that sufficient oleomargarine
for our requirements could be made available
in 1948, or even in 1950. If you read the last
paragraph of the I.E.F.C. report of September,
1947, you will find that there is no way of
guaranteeing an early supply.

SENATE

W'hat we are asked to do in the motion
before the house is to support categorically
the principle of this bill. Yet there are twio
or threc alternatives. I might, point to the
action taken in the other house in 1934 and
three fines in 1946. 1 have the~ tr xt of the'
resolutions here, in case any honourable senator would be interested in sccing therni. On
the occasions I have mentioned. and not with
the unanimous consent of tbe bouse-their
practice is slightly different fromn ours the
subject-matter of the resolution ivas referrrd
to corcmittee. with instructions to invcstigate
aed report. 1 understand thiat herc unanimous
consent is necessary for the est ablishmecnt of
committees other thann those appointed in
accordance xith established usage.
I have before me a hrief digest of the
essential featurcs of this important international report on fats and cils. I cannot
uinderstand, perhaps because cf my mnadequitte expericnce, how it is that those who
dlaimi to be pleading the ause cf elemients in
cur ccmmunify who are floundering in a social
or industrial mcrass, want to extend special
consideration also to people in the fairly coinfortable classes, and are rcady te do s0 at the
expense cf non-compliance îvith an international agreement which is intended to vinelicate Canadian idealism. 1 wculd remind
rny felîce-Liberals who are going te vote for
this bill. as well as my friends opposite. who
are likc-minded, that part cf the idealismi cf
Liberalism in the pest-war veas wras that, we
should embark
upon great
international
schemes. It may bo that we have gcne toc
tar; but after aIl, comparatively speaking.
Canada is a young and wealthy country. In
any event. in pursuance cf an expressed purpose a world basis cf fats and cils was constructed by the I.E.F.C.. which began its
operations supported bv the pravers cf the
whole woî Id. A part cf its findings. or subfindings, are contained in the report.
The action we are askcd to takze is not bv
e-ay cf inve~stigation.
1 do not objeet te
investigation; 1 desire it; 1 wculd welcome it;
I think it is the only logical wav to procecd.
As the gcvernment leader, I believe, suggested.
a ccmmittee cf inquiry wculd ho in a position
te give the reail facts to the Canadien people.
I do flot want thern te bc misguided or misled
by a dramatie gesture or a categorical request
sîîch as would be implied in the second reading
cf this bill. On the issue itself, I do net
believe that my honcurable friend frorm
Waterloo and mysoîf are far apart. Where
we differ is that, I refuse te arccpt this measure

without adequate information, whichi at this
time is possessed neither by me, nor, I believe,
by anybody else.
Hon. Mr. EULER: I do net want te interfriend, but dees he- not k-now that
what hie proposes cani be effected in an easy
and regular way threugh cur procedure? Upon
second reading, the bill can ho referred te a
standing committce, te ho discusscd and fully
investigatcd.
mept niy

Riglt Hon. Mr. MACKENZIE: That fact
is well ixithin rny knewledge; but the proceilure suggested, namely, reference te ceinmittee after second reading. amounts te an
as-.crtion and a(lmI,,,sion cf the direeting ill
cf rny bonourable frienel and colleaguie. The
eIL1tit1n ceuld go hefore a comnuittce, in the
two other wavs which I have mentioned, without eornpelling dbus bouse beforehanel te corne
te what amiounts te a conclusion on the
m erits.
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN:
on first rcading.

Lt cannot ho done

Rigbt Hon. Mr. MACKENZIE: My honcurable friend frcm Waterloo could withdraw
bis bill, and the leader cf the bouse could move
next d-ay for a complote national investigation cf the wbcle question. Or my bonourable
friend could rescrt te the alternative procedure I bave mentioned. I would cite Beaucbesne, paragraph 755, Bourinot, page 509, and
May, page 357, and I present these authorities
on procedure te my boncurable friend for bis
guidance and correction. Why sbould not tbis
bo donc? Why not go ahead with a full investigation cf the whole world situation? Why flot
put aIl the facts before the people, instead cf
ccnfronting them, as tbis bill does, with a
sert cf categorical imperative?
One matter w'hicb the cemmittee might well
inquire inte is that cf our imports cf fats and
cils. Yezterday I heard wbat seemeel to me
a mcst amazing statement-that our allocations xxould net ho affected by our indigenous
domestic production. Admittedly the statement was withdrawn afterwards; but it is
net sense, it is net logical, it is net truc. A
second matter for inquiry hy the committee
sbculd ho allocations cf supplies made by the
Fats and Oils Committee cf the International
Emergency Food Committee cf the F.A.O.; a
third, the current, production cf supplies of
these commodities in Canada, and a fourth,
the facilities, rescurces and capacity of Canada
to produce increasing supplies cf fats and oils.
We have had some little evidence on that

MAY 5, 1948

matter, but how meagre it is? In the whole
course of the debate the protagonists of the
measure named only three produets which
would be available in Canada for the manufacture of oleomargarine.
Hon. Mr. EULER: That is enough.
Right Hon. Mr. MACKENZIE: Finally,
the committee could inquire as to what action
should be taken to develop markets within and
without Canada for fats and oils.
I am not going to deal with figures of international production. I think the house bas
been somewhat wearied with these statistics.
I am convinced that sufficient evidence bas
not been produced that the world supply of
fats and oils will sustain or support the policy
which is proposed. I am convinced that the
evidence so far presented to this house does
not show that Canada can manufacture oleomargarine in adequate quantities within a
reasonable time.
Hon. Mr. CAMPBELL: In view of the fact
that it is admitted there is a world shortage
of fats and oils, and that all other countries are
able to allot their fats and oils so as to enable
them to manufacture oleomargarine, does the
right honourable senator not admit that if the
prohibition were removed it would be possible,
practical and likely that Canada would be
able to organize its distribution of fats and
oils so as to permit of the manufacture of
oleomargarine?
Right Hon. Mr. MACKENZIE: Certainly,
but only in the way I suggested, and not by
any dictatorial policy adopted by one nation
against the terms of a general agreement. If
it is done by consultation, co-operation and
re-allocation, I say by all means that it would
be absolutely feasible. But it cannot be done
if one country after another asks for its quota,
its pound of flesh or pound of fat, and withdraws from this organization which my friend,
as one of the great protagonists of Liberal
ideals in the province of Ontario, should be
first to support. I am sure he would not go
back on the very principles that be has
supported. Of course my honourable friend
from Waterloo (Hon. Mr. Euler) never did
support them.
Some bon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Right Hon. Mr. MACKENZIE: Three
times in 1934 my honourable friend from
conspired with my honourable
Waterloo
friend from Churchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar) and
myself-I indict myself along with my two
friends-

Hon. Mr. EULER: I refuse to be a coconspirator with you, sir.
Right Hon. Mr. MACKENZIE: Honourable senators, I have had many compliments
paid me during my public life, but never one
so emphatically appreciated as that.
Hon. Mr. EULER: You are welcome to it.
Right Hon. Mr. MACKENZIE: My bonourable friend must exhibit a fine spirit of
tolerance, because I know be is sincere in his
attitude to this bill. But be will never succeed in having the ban removed by proceeding
in the way that be is. If be wishes to speak
aloud, be can do so; but I do not think mutterings or stumblings are fair. He and I have
been in debates before, and I hope we shall be
again; but if he is sincere and wants results,
let him ask this house to recommend a
national investigation into this whole question.
I think the house would unanimously agree
to such a proposal tomorrow.
Honourable senators, the oleomargarine
question is not a new one. Its history dates
back to about 1867, when the original formula
for its manufacture was worked out by a
French chemist. In 1886 the United States
approved an act making oleomargarine and
other dairy-product substitutes subject to the
laws of any state or territory or the District of
Columbia. In the same year the revised
statutes of Canada contained an Act to Prohibit the Manufacture and Sale of Certain
Substitutes for Butter. Subsequently, the prohibition of the manufacture of oleomargarine
in Canada was incorporated in the Butter
Act, 1903, chapter 6, section 5, which reads as
follows:
No person shall manufacture, import into
Canada, or offer, sell or have in his possession
for sale, any oleomargarine, butterine, or other
substitute for butter, manufactured wholly or
in part from any fat other than milk or cream.
In 1906 the Inspection and Sales Act,
chapter 85 of the revised statutes, section
298, contained section 5 of the Butter Act,
1903, with respect to oleomargarine.
In
1914, part 8 of the Inspection and Sales Act
was repealed, and section 5 of that act was
re-enacted in the Dairy Industry Act, 1914,
chapter 7. This act appears in the revised
statutes of 1927 as chapter 45, section 5A of
which relates to the prohibition, manufacture,
importation and sale of oleomargarine in
Canada. Then during the first Great War
and for a few years afterwards-people are
inclined to forget some of these thingsowing to the abnormal demand for butter
and the prevailing high prices resulting from
war conditions, the manufacture, importation

and sale cf oleomargarine became legal in
*Canada on December 1, 1917. The manufacture and importation was prohibited after
August 31, 1923, and the sale was prohibited

MAY 5, 1948

does that of my friend, who so very recently
changed bis mind with regard to the bill.
Hon. A. L. BEAUBIEN: New liglit may
cause a man to change bis mind.
Hon. Mr. EULER: I have no objection t-o a
man's changing his mind. My right honourable
friend being a reasonable man and, as I know,
absolutely in favour of the principle under.
lying this bill, I had seme small hope that if
he listened carefully to what I said he wou]d,
instead of asking me to withdraw the bill, corne
over to my side and vote for the second reading. To be frank, I hoped that the motion for
second reading would carry, so that, in accordance witb the usual practice here, the bil could
be referred to a cornmittee. I would flot insist
upon reference to a committee, but I am in
favour of it. Let the bill go to a cermîttee in
the regular way, and !let there be examination
of, and testimony by, ail the experts we care te
prod-uce; then, if the bill receives third reading, let us send it te the Ilouse of Commons,
se tbat the members of that bouse may assume
the responsibiulity which ought te lie theirs,
and from the exercise of wbich we have no
right te excuse them.
I would point out-I had not intended te
say this, but it bas just corne te my mindtbat if the blli is given second reading and
referred to a committee, any member wbo
voted for the second reading but later cbanged
bis views because of discussion or evidence at
the committee, would be perfectly within bis
rights in voting against the motion for third
reading.
Tbese are by way of preliminary rernarks
called forth by tbe speech of my riglit bonourable friend and former colleague in another
place (Right Hon. Mr. Mackenzie). But it
seerns te me that bis speech, like sorne others
in this debate, departed almost entireiy froma
a consideration of the principle underlying the
bill.
Hon. Mr. QUINN: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. EULER: I do net wisb te become
tedious in reiterating this, but it sbould lie
repeated that, after ail, the one principle tbat
lies at the root of this bll is one that ouglit
to be recognized by every democratic person
in tbis assembly, namely, the principle of free
choice, of free enterprise and of free competition witbin our own country, Can anyone
combat that? Among the senators opposed te
tbe second reading of this bill, is there one
who is not in favour of the principle wbicb I
have enunciated? Certainly that priýnciple bas
nlot been denied by anyone who lias spoken
against the blli itself.

I said there bad been a departure from a
discussion of the principle of the bill. The
chief contributor to that departure, I regret to
say, was tbe government leader in the Senate
(Hon. Mr. Robertson), whose speech almost
entirely dealt with the scarcity of fats and
oils. Strangely enougli, wbat lie said seems
te bave influenced some senaters who I believe
are entirely in faveur of tbe principle of tbe
bill and intended te vote for second reading.
Since tbe leader raised the question of oils and
fats, I arn quite prepared to meet bim on bis
ewn ground as well as on mine. I arn glad lie
did say that he was not announcing a geverfiment policy-altiough a gond many members
and former members of the gevernrnent bave
been supporting bis opposition te the bill-for
I should net like te believe that a government
whicb fouglit the great war, and a gevernment
of wbicb several of my colleagues and I were
for a time members, weuld give way te sucb
a feeling of defeatisrn and disappointrnent as
man threugli the wbole of tbe leader's long
speech.
The leader asked tliree questions, which I
quote from Hanserd, as follows:
My first question is: Sbould tbe Senate pass
flua bill, will the consumera ef Canada then be
able te, margarine in additien to the butter,
get
shortening and other foods containing fats and
cils which they are getthng now? My second
question is: Why net pass this bll, even if we
cannet get margarine fer the next three years
er more? Could it de any harm? My third
quetien ha:
How caa the contreversy ever
margarine le aettled ia a reasonable and constructive way, acceptable te loth the d.airy
farmers and the censuming public?
The leader answered these questions apparently te bis own satisfaction. I propose aIse
as I go along te answer tbem. but I fear our
respective answers will lie quite different.
Practically the wbole of the speech of my
friend dealt witli the scarcity of eils and fats
in the world, and the fact that there is a
national pool er organizatien which distributes
or allocates the varieus oils and fats te the
different member countries. Finally, lie stated
that sliould this bllI for the legalizing of margarine lie passed, we could not possibly bave
that cemmedity in Canada for at least three
years. Witli that staternent I wisb te take
direct and uncemprernising issue. I say witheut any rea.sonable fear ef contradiction that
witli the repeal of this prehibitory law and the
co-eperation of the government, we can bave
margarine in Canada net in tbree years but i
three weeks.
Hon. A. L. BEAUBIEN:
garine?

Irnperted. mar-

SENATE

Hon. Mr. EULER: No, not imported. In
tbree or four weeks we could have a moderate
supply of margarine by taking the ingredients
for its manufacture from the quota of fats and
oils now allotted to us by the international
organization; and within a period of some
months, certainly less than a year, we could
make it in any quantity desired, from Canadian-grown products. As far as the first method
is concerned. the oils and fats that would be
required, regardless of where they come from,
are absolutely at the disposal of the government of Canada to do with exactly as it pleases.
Nobody else can prevent the allocation of
a certain portion of our quota of oils and fats
to the manufacture of margarine, and the
allotment of a small quantity for that purpose
would be greatly appreciated by the people of
Canada.
I will not deai at length with importation,
because, as honourable members know from
my previous remarks, I am not particularly
concerned about that question. I would much
prefer that our margarine be made in Canada
fron Canadian fats and oils. Furthermore, I
predict, and I base my prediction on reliable
information, that before the end of this year
the control of oils and fats will have entirely
disappearcd.
Hon. Mr. HOWARD: I hope so.
Hon. Mr. EULER: My friend from Wellington says that he hopes se; but I am a little
afraid that, even though we acquire all the
fats and oils we need to make margarine, my
friend will still be found on the side of those
wio say we shall not have it.
The question of the quota has been discussed
at some length. I say that we can make margarine out of a certain portion of our quota.
Why should we not do se?
Hon. Mr. HOWARD: Who would you take
it from?
Hon. Mr. EULER: I suppose we would
have to take it from the poor 3,000 bakers that
the leader referred to.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I make no apology
for them.
Hon. Mr. EULER: My friend from Toronto
(Hon. Mr. Hayden) said that it was better te
supply the millions of consumers with a butter
substitute than to permit the 3,000 bakers to
make as many pies as they wished.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: May I ask My
friend who buys the products of the 3,000
bakers?
Hon. Mr. EULER: Certainly not all of the
10,000,000 or more people in this country.

That question does not require an answer.
But since my friend bas asked me a question,
I should like to ask him one: If all the other
countries in the world which are now under the
quota system find it possible to make margarine, why cannot Canada do likewise?
Hon. Mr. QUINN: I can answer that one.
Hon. Mr. EULER: Some of those countries
make margarine net only for their own consumption but for export. I have before me
an unsolicited telegram from a commission
merchant in Toronto stating that he had
received offers from two United States concerns to send him 30,000 pounds of margarine
daily at 34 cents a pound, and that it could be
sold in Canada at 40 cents. provided the
government did net put a tax of 10 cents on it.
Hon. Mr. QUINN: Ten cents or more.
Hon. Mr. EULER: I ask again why, if the
other countries of the world can produce margarine out of their quotas of fats and oils,
Canada cannot do so?
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: Is it not true that the
per capita consumption of butter in Canada
is greater than the per capita consumption in
any other country of butter and margarine
combined?
Hon. Mr. EULER: That is net the case. I
have heard a great deal said about the consumption of butter in Canada, which is about
twenty-eight pounds per capita. Just prior
te the war-I think in 1939-that great butterproducing country, Denmark, produced as
much as sixty pounds of margarine and butter
per capita.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: I am asking about the
consumption per capita, not the production.
Hon. Mr. EULER: I must make an apology
here, honourable senators. I had a letter from
the Danish minister in Ottawa, which gave
me all those figures. Believe it or net, that
letter bas mysteriously disappeared. But these
are the facts as I remember them. Even though
Denmark was practically unable to make
margarine during the war-she could not get
the materials from which she formerly made it
-she is now producing and consuming butter
and margarine to an amount greater than
Canada's butter consumption.
But supposing we do consume twenty-eight
pounds per capita, or more than any other
nation, is that any reason why we should net
have margarine if we want it? Reference has
been made te the United States. It is truc,
that their consumption of butter and margarine
is ,not as great as the Canadian consumption of

MAY 5, 1948

butter per head of the population. Americans
do not need as much. Any honourable gentleman who has visited the southern areas of the
United States, where the climate is warm, and
where a large percentage of the population is
not in a position to buy butter, or perhaps
even margarine, well knows why the consumption in that country is smaller than in ours.
But what is happening in Britain, where, as
in so many other countries, the production of
oils and fats is proportionately no greater than
ours? The British government has entered
into arrangements with the colony and protectorate of Kenya, East Africa, for the largescale production of ground-nuts, which we call
peanuts; and this is donc, I am informed,
solely for the purpose of making margarine.
The question occurs to me, if we are so tied
down to this quota system, how can Britain
be at liberty to import large supplies of peanut
oil for the manufacture
of margarine?
Undoubtedly she is restricted by quota. But
today Britain is actually exporting margarine
to Newfoundland, as I believe the government
leader himself has stated.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON:
No. I merely
said that Newfoundland's oils would now be
allocated through Britain.
Hon. Mr. EULER: I accept the correction.
But I repeat, if this course is open to Britain,
why is it not open to Canada? If Canada
should derive a larger quantity of oils and
fats from her own farms, and other countries
follow suit, and if the total world supply of
oils and fats is increased through the action
of all countries subject to the quota, no one
can convince me that our quota cannot be
correspondingly increased, instead of being
subject to reduction, as was intimated during
this debate. Is there any logical reason why,
looking to the day when more oils and fats
will be available and controls are lifted, even
though it takes a little longer than some of us
expect, we should not remove at once this
obstacle to supply of margarine? What harm
can result?
The government leader said the other day
that he did not foresee any harm-apparently
because margarine would not be obtainable
within three years anyhow-so why should the
producer of butter worry about it? But he
gave a reason for not repealing the present
law which, because of his ability and good
judgment, very much surprised me. He said
that in his own province of Nova Scotia-I
apologize to the leader of the opposition (Hon.
Mr. Haig) for using that word "own" perhaps
a little too freely-some thousands of farmers, a large number of whom are returned
men who are operating marginal farms, are

barely able to get along, and that if the ban
on margarine were repealed they would go
into an agony of fear which would lead them
to sell their farms at any price at all and get
out. That assumption is far from complimentary to the courage of soldiers living in Nova
Scotia, or indeed, to soldiers in any part of
Canada. If a reply is necessary, my answer
would be, though probably it is not a complete reply, that I have every sympathy with
the few thousand of our boys in Nova Scotia
who may be apprehensive of repeal, but that
in towns and cities throughout the length and
breadth of this land there are anywhere from
200,000 to half a million returned men who
today cannot get butter and who, if they
could, cannot afford to buy it. I am willing to
balance one consideration against the other.
When I moved the second reading of the
bill I said I thought it was of great importance
to make margarine in Canada from the
products of Canadian farms, without importing an ounce of material from any other
country. I am still of that opinion. I had a
conversation in Ottawa with a man whom I
regard as one of our leading scientific authorities, as eminent as any in the country. I made
a memorandum of that conversation, and with
the permission of honourable members I will
read it, because it presents the facts more
concisely, perhaps, than I could do off-hand.
From 1941 through the war years it is estimated that more than 95 per cent of the
German edible fat requirements were met by
margarine and shortenings made from rapeseed
oil. In fact the whole German fats and oils
economy was based on rapeseed oil.
If the making of margarine is to depend
largely on vegetable oil, the operation for margarine .and shortening is almost the same. For
shortening, the oil requires refining, bleaching,
To make
hydrogenation and deodorization.
margarine, a further simple treatment is rewould have to be mixed
quired. The material
with milk, or water, or milk solids and other
minor components, .which add only slightly to
the content. The costs of this extra operation
would largely be met by the saving resulting
from the use of milk, or milk solids and, water.
It is therefore reasonable to conclude that the
retail price of margarine should closely -approximate that of shortening.
In Ottawa in mid-January of this year
shortening was selling for 30 cents a pound.
t
So, I repeat, ·here is every reason to believe
that margarine would sell for a price as low as
the price of shortening today, namely 30 cents
a pound, while butter sells for 73 cents a
pound. I have always held that margarine
could be sold in Canada for not more than
40 cents a pound, and it would appear that this
figure could well be reduced.
The answer to the question of whether margarine could be made in this country or not is

SENATE

very simple. The firms which are now producing shortening would need to add only
slightly to the processes already established
in their plants to fit them for the manufacture
of margarine.
Discussions on the margarine question from
the Canadian point of view have frequently
stressed the lack of suitable Canadian fats for
the purpose of manufacture. It is true that
for some years Canada has not been in an
independent position so far as the productien of edible fats is concerned, but it must
now be realized that our prairie regions and
other areis are eminently suited to the production of oil ,eed crops sueh a rapeseed. In
addition to the production of rapeseed cil we
have a very substantial tonnage of mustard
screenings, available from western grain crops.
Hon. A. L. BEAUBIEN: You will not have
them very long. We are killing mustard seed
now with 2, 4-D.
Hon. Mr. EULER: Both these materials are
suitable for making edible oils, and should be
seriously considered in assessing the whole
question from a strictly Canadian point of
view. As a mîatter of fact, during 1947 some
4,000 tons of rapeseed oil, which is quite suitable for the making of margarine. were
exported fron Canada. A recently built plant
at Fort William is expected te bc in operation
in tle nar future. Far from having to depend
on imported oils, we have rapeseed and mustard seed oils available today, and these can
be used in the preparation of a satisfactory
margarine.
These considerations make it
clear that rapeseed and mustard seed oils, now
exported, can be diverted to the immediate
production of margarine in Canada.
Another very important point to be remembered is that this progran woild also make
available large aoieunts of high protein oil
cake, which would prove most valuable in
the feeding of livestock, and would provide a
source of substantial additional income to the
farmers of this country.
It is intercsting, by the way. to sec that
last year in the provinces of Saskatchewan and
Manitoba alone 70;000 acres of land-an area
comparable to the acreage given to potatoes
in the province of New Brunswick-were given
to the production of rapeseed.
I have here a letter addressed to me, and
which reads as follows:
In your letter of Friday last, you asked me
certain questions in regard t

he production of

vegetable oil in Canada.
Prior to the war, there were oight oil crushing plants in 'ainada valued at $100.000 or over.
Today, there are sixteen crushing plants in
Canada. eight of whliich are valued at over

$1,000,000 apiece. The crushing capacity in
Canada today is at least three times what it
was prior te the war.
The production of edible vegetable oil that
could be used in the making of margarine was
8.000,000 pounds prior to the war and is nov
33,500,000

pounds, all of this from Canadian-

grown raw materials.
You asked from what kind of oils produced
in Canada could we make margarine.
The
answer is corn oil, rapeseed, sunflower seed,
and soy bean seed.
And of course you could use milk and a few
ingrcdients like salt and other chemicals.
Hon. A. L. BEAUBIEN:
mustard seed oil?

Could you use

lon. Mr. EULER: Yes.
That letter is signed by J. G. Ross, who is
very wvell known to many honourable senators.
He is president of Prairie Vegetable Oils
Limited, Moose Jaw, Saskatchewan, and vicepresident of Edible Oils Limited of Fort
William, Ontario. He was formerly a capable
memnber of the House of Commons.
There is a fourth way in which we could
have margarine in Canada. I am not a constitutional lawyer; in fact, T am not a lawyer
at all. I do net know whether I should congratulate myself on that fact or not.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: It would not do any
harm.
Hon. Mr. EULER: I was not looking at
mîy honourable friend when I made that
remark. The constitutional question was efficiently dealt with yesterday by my honourable
friend from Toronto (Hon. Mr. Hayden). In
his opinion, and in the opinion of at least
three or four eminent constitutional lawyers,
the Government of Canada cannot interfere
with the making of margarine, or anything else
in any province from the products of that
province.
Hon. A. L. BEAUBIEN: Why has it not
been made then?
lon. Mr. EULER: There is a law against
it, a law which has to be tested out. I am
glad to sec that it now seems to be in the
process of being tested. No one can go to the
courts of Canada and say, for instance, that he
wants an expression of opinion as to whether
the law prohibiting the manufacture of margarine is good. Lawyers know this better than
I do, but I have made inquiry. The courts
ill not give an opinion on an abstract question
like that; action must be brought by an
interested person.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: They would give
that opinion to the government of the day.

MAY 5, 1948
Hon. Mr. EULER: Quite so. I was flot
going to mention it, but last fall, believing that
the law was unconstitutional, I thought the
best way out of the situation for everybody
concerned would be for the government to make
such a test. I wrote to the Minister of Justice,
suggesting that be submit a stated case to the
Supreme Court of Canada; and if we got a
decision such as I tbought we would get, the
whole question would be settled and there
would be no prejudice against aniyone.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: Except by importation from some other country.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Go on. What did he say?
Hon. Mr. EULER: H1e declined to accept
my suggestion.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: May I ask my
honourable friend if he made any such appli-

cation whule he was Minister of Trade and
Commerce or Minister of National Revenue?

Hon. Mr. EULER: I think that is just about
as irrelevant a question as anybody could ask.
I arn quite willing to leave my record on
margarine to the judgment of the people of
Canada.

Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. A. L. BEAUBIEN: If it is claimed
by the legal minds of this Senate that the
law is ultra vires of the Dominion of Canadaand I tbink my bonourable friend from. Waterloo agrees that it isHon. Mr. EULER: Yes.
Hon. A. L. BEAUBIEN:-why did the
people behind this proposition not make
some margarine, be prosecuted for it, and
thus have the law tested in court?
Hon. Mr. EULER: That is a very fair
question. I think in ail probability that will
be donc.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. A. L. BEAUBIEN: That is the best
way to do it.
Hon. .Mr. FARRIS: Is a court not the
enly body to settle a constitutional question?
It

is not for the Senate to settle it.

Mr. EULER:

rcpealing any law wbich is against the democratie principles of this country.
Some Hon. SENATORS:

Hon. Mr. EULER: It is just about as
irrelevant as the previeus one.
Hon. A. L. BEAUBIEN: The bonourable
senator does not mean my question, I bope.
Hon. Mr. EULER: No. I would not give
my good friend from Provencher (Hon. A. L.
Beaubien) that kind of an answer.

I should agaiýn like to refer to the constitutional

question.

Hon. Mr. HAIG: I do not want the judgment to be inaccurately stated on the record.
Hon. Mr. EULER: I suppose that, not
being a lawyer, I made a mistake in venturing
into a legal field.
However, I have also
found lawyers to be wrong, many a time.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Do not look at the senator
from Rosetown (Hon. Mr. Aseltine) when
you are saving that, or you will lose a vote.
Hon. Mr. EULER: I should have said
"some lawvers".
TIe inference I draw from that judgment
is that if it is beyond the powers of the
federal government to interfere in matters
of property and civil rights within a province,
then it cannot prevent the making of
margarine or anything else-furniture, boots
and choesAn Hon. SENATOR: Whisky.

settled we may not need to bring in this
bill again next year.

at-titude.
Hon. Mr. EULER: I do not object to
questions and interruptions. but they rather
impode the progress I should like to make.
Hon. Mr. QUINN: It is not fair that the
honourable gentleman should be subjected to
so many interruptions.
Hon. A. L. BEAUBIEN:

It is pleasant to

Hon. Mr. EULER: Many questions have
been asked of me, and now I should like to
ask one, although I hope honourable members
will not answer it in unison. Why have we
this desperate opposition to the bill? If it
would be impossible to produce margarine
in Canada for three years, how could buttermakers or anyone else be hurt by passage
of the bill?
I have already referred to the argument
made by the leader of the opposition, and I
will not deal with it again.

Hon. Mr. HAIG: I rise on a
order. I did not make a speech.

point of

Hon. Mr. EULER: I apologize; I meant
the leader of the government (Hon. Mr.
Robertson). The leader of the opposition
(Hon. Mr. Haig) has been very quiet during
this debate. He did not say a word on the
subject of margarine this year or last year,
and I have been wondering why, becauso he
speaks on every other question. I might say
to the leader of the government that if ho
cared to look about he would probably find
margarine in his own native province today.
I think it can also be found in the province
of Quebec.
But why is there this opposition all along
the line? Why the attempt at Geneva to
avoid the honest obligation undertaken by our
negotiators there? And bore in Ottawa, when
it was feared that the agreement made in good
faith by us with other countries would require
a repeal of the ban on the importation of margarine, why were the law officers of the Crown
asked whether that was a legal obligation on
the government? All along the line there bas
been shown an antagonism to margarine under
any and all circumstances. One of the responsible ministers of the Crown intimated that if
it did become necessary to remove the ban on
the importation of margarine, we would impose
such a high tariff that none of the commodity
w ould come into the country in any event.
Hon. A. L. BEAUBIEN: You ought to be
in favour of a high tariff.
Hon. Mr. EULER: I never in my life was
for a high tariff.
I fear that this talk about the scarcity of
fats and oils will mislead some of my good
frienl, into voting against the bill, although
I know tbey are in favour of its principle.
I would like to tell them a little story. A man
went to one of his neighbours to borrow a rope,
but the neighbour said, "I cannot lend you
that rope because I need it for tying up some
sand." The would-be borrower remarked that
you cannot tie up sand with a rope. "Oh," was
the reply, "you can tie up almost everything
with a rope that you do not want to lend."
I am convinced that whether or not we have in
this country an ample supply of fats and oils
is a question that bas no bearing on the dotermination of some members of the Senate to see
that the present law is not repealed. But if
cils and fats are not available for the manufacture of margarine, what point is there in
keeping the present law in force? It is worse
than useless; it is just a nuisance. Would the
logical course not be to repeal it in preparation for the day, which I am sure is not far

455

MAY 5, 1948
distant, when the caim will no longer be made
that there is a scarcity of oils and fats?
In so far as this bill is concerned there are
but two groups in the house. The first comprises those who, for one reason or anothera political reason, if you like, in some instances
-are opposed to the introduction of margarine
into Canada, whether by manufacture or
importation. I would naturally expect those
members to vote against second reading. But
the other group believes conscientiously in the
principle that is at the root of this bill-the
principle of freedom of choice, free competition and free enterprise. To those members
I say: I cannot for the life of me understand
why you should vote against the bill. If you
do, you will be voting against yourselves. Let
me put it another way. If there were no ban
on margarine at present and conditions were
exactly as they are today, would you vote to
put this prohibitory law on the statute books
now? I am quite sure you would not.
During the war there were shortages of many
commodities, but did we pass laws forbidding
the use of those commodities in the making of
other things? There was, for instance, a scarcity of bricks, but did we prohibit the erection
of brick houses? There was a scarcity of
greases and fats used in the manufacture of
soap, but did we make that manufacture
illegal? There was and is a shortage of iron
and steel and of nails. But would anyone suggest that we should prohibit the erection of
bridges or other structures requiring the use
of these materials? No. We would have regulations restricting the use, just as we have
quotas for the time being; but in no case
would we have a law prohibiting the manufacture of any article that was scarce in this
country.
I say again to my friends, do not be misled
by what you have heard with regard to the
scarcity of oils. Propaganda has gone out
which, I fear, has led many of our people to
surrender to the ignoble feeling that the mere
mention of margarine may give rise to an
unfounded fear on the part of the farmers
who produce butter. If I may particularize in
this respect, I would refer to the President of
the Federation of Agriculture.
Secondly,
there is a fear for political reasons. I am putting the case bluntly. I think nobody will
deny that there is a fear of the political effect
that the permission of the use of margarine
would have in this country. I say that those
fears are entirely unfounded or greatly exaggerated.
May I be permitted to give an allegory
which I have previously presented in this
house? Because it is appropriate to the situation today it bears ýrepeating. It goes some-

thing like this: A traveller was passing through
an eastern country where the plague takes its
toll of hundreds of thousands, and sometimes
millions, of people. As he stood on a hill,
overlooking a large city, the spirit of the
plague joined him and said, "I am going to
take the lives of 5,000 people in this city."
The traveller continued on his journey, and
later heard that 50,000 people in that city had
died of the plague. After a time he again met
the spirit of the plague and said to him, "You
told me you would take the lives of 5,000
people in that city, but I hear you took
50,000". "Oh, no," said the spirit of the plague,
"I took only 5,000 lives; the other 45,000
died of fear". That, I think, pretty well
describes the situation today.
I am convinced that the makers of butter
would not be seriously injured by the removal
of the ban; and I am pretty well satisfied that
the people of Canada, being fair-minded, as
they are, would not hold it against a man who
wanted to be returned to parliament that he
had voted in favour of permitting oleomargarme.
The Canadian people will not be satisfied
with the explanations offered thus far for
the failure to give them margarine. They will
not understand why they get no answer to
the question: "Why can I not get margarine
if I want it?" The housewife cannot appreciate
why she is denied margarine when either she
is unable to buy butter or cannot afford to pay
73 cents a pound for it. I ask my honourable
friends what decent reply we can make to
these questions, in fairness to millions of consumers in this country.
Certain points arising out of this debate are
now pretty well settled. For instance, the
wholesomeness of margarine is unquestioned.
It is even admitted by the opponents of the
bill, so I will not discuss it. A second feature
is the butter shortage. Experience tells us that
it is a fact. I think it was the President of
the Borden Milk Company who, in speaking
recently before the Special Committee on
Prices of the House of Commons, made the
statement that next year-that is the fall of
this year-the shortage of butter will be much
more pronounced and will come earlier; and
further, that he saw no remedy for the shortage except to import butter or ration it.
By way of a little sidelight may I refer to a
newspaper handed to me today? It is the
Halifax Herald.
Hon. Mr. DUFF:

Oh, dearl

Hon. Mr. COPP: Be careful or you will lose
your friend from Lunenburg.

SENATE

Hon. Mr. EULER: The article I refer to is
dated Kentville, May 2, and the first paragraph reads as follows:
Annapolis Valley towns, heretofore immune
to the provincial butter shortage, are now
going through praetically the same experience
as city dw ellers. Despite the fact that this is
one of the heaviest butter-producing sections of
the province, the shortage is more acute than at
any time during the war.
I would expect my honourable friend from
Kings' (Hon. Mr. MeDonald) to make the
observation, as he did before, that perhaps the
children down there would prefer pie to margarine. He might make the further appropriate retort, coming as he does from the
famous Annapolis Valley, that it is all "applesauce" anyway.
Riglt Hon. Mr.
Scotia is all right.

MACKENZIE:

Nova

Hon. Mr. QUINN: Read further in the
article where it tells about the killing of the
dairy cattle.
Hon. Mr. EULER: The suggestion bas been
made in this bouse that the oleonargarine
question is "dynamite." I presume by that it
is meant that it is political dynamite. I am
sorry i bas corne te that stage. It was
thought hy some to be political dynamite only
in so far as the farmers' vote was concerned;
but the agitation has now developed te the
point where te poliîical dynamite bas reached
the large towxns and cities, and it may be that
the votes represented in urban centres contain
more dynamite than the votes locked in the
the farners' barns. I am sorry that the question bas taken a political aspect, because that
could very easily have been avoided. If
margarine lad been permitted in this country
two years ago, experience by now would have
shown that the butter producer and the
farmer were net being injured, and that we
are in the same category as those other countries which permit its manufacture.
I heard a most cynical remark recently fron
a prominent public man. I made the same
statement te him that I have just made here,
to which li te pliedHon. A. L. BEAUBIEN: Why does my
honourable friend always point his finger at
me?
Hon. Mr. EULER: I suppose it is because
of a conviction in my mind that my friend
requires a little admonition.
This man replied that when it came to election timue those who did net get margarine
would have forgotten their disappointment;
but lad margarine come in, the farmer would

net have forgotten his grievance when be came
to vote. Therefore, the right thing to do
was te refuse margarine.
A moment ago I said that there are two
groups in the house-those who are determined that we never shall have margarine;
and those who believe in the principle underlying this bill. To them I say, if we believe
in the principle let us pass the bill, and let it
go to committee, if you like, and ultimately te
the House of Commons, wlere the members
of that body can assume the responsibility
which is theirs.
It may be that this bill will again be
defeated. I am not really worrying about
that; but I point out that if it is, the defeat
will be a costly one as far as the prestige of
the Senate is concerned, because the consumers of Canada will net accept kindly the
repeated denial of their democratie right.
It is often said that senators, who are not
subject to election, are peculiarly qualified to
judge issues without prejudice and without
fear. They are supposed to bc the protectors
of minorities. But I submit that they are
just as much the protectors of majorities; and
tlie great majority of the people of this countr- are in faveur of oleomargarine.
The state of publie opinion on this question
is well known. One need only look through
the newspapers of the last year to be convinced that day by day the public demand
for a change in the law is growing; and so
far as I know there is net a newspaper, at
least of any importance, in our towns and
cities from Vancouver to Halifax which ias
not declared repeatedly that the use of margarine in this country should be legalized.
Resolutions to this effect have been passed by
almost every organized body in the country.
I had prepared a much longer list of these
bodies than is now before me; presumably it
has been mislaid; but here are sone of the
organizations whici faveur the use of margarine: Canadian Congress of Labour, Canadian Association of Women Voters, Canadian
Lumbermen's Association. Canadian Welfare
Council, Montreal Council of Social Agencies,
Food Distributors of Manitoba, the Legislabure of Manitoba-an agricultural prairie
province.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: But with what amendment?
Hon. Mr. EUILER: My honourable friend
can tell me if he likes. The legislature
approved the use of margarine.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Yeu have quoted the legislature as being favourable. Now state the
amendment.

MAY 5, 1948
Hon. Mr. EULER: I have not it here. My
honourable friend knows perfectly well that
the principle of use of margarine was
approved.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: No, it was not.
Hon. Mr. EULER: Other organizations
were: the West Hill United Church of Hamilton, with a petition containing one hundred
signatures; the Toronto City Council, the
Ottawa City Council, the London City Council, and numerous smaller municipalities whose
names I will not read; also several boards of
health, the Canadian Restaurant Association,
some two hundred boards of trade and chambers of commerce, many labour organizations,
many branches of the Canadian Legion, hospitals, churches, preachers and other individuals. In a poll conducted by a women's
magazine, Chatelaine, printed in Toronto and
having 285,000 circulation, 80 per cent of the
women voted for margarine, 16 per cent
against, and 4 per cent had no opinion. Then
we have the result of the Gallup poll.
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: Before my honourable friend continues, may I ask him a question? He bas read extracts from letters of
various persons who corresponded with him.
Will ha tell the bouse if these were received
in response to a broadcast which was made by
him about the time of the opening of the
debate on this bill?
Hon. Mr. EULER: I certainly did not make
any broadcast, and I do not know of any
letters received in reply to one.
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: You told the Senate
that a broadcast was made in which people
were invited to send in expressions of opinion,
and you mentioned that you had received
fifty-seven letters in response to it.
Hon. Mr. EULER: None of those is mentioned here. The reference made at that time
was to a local broadcast at St. Catharines,
inviting people in the surrounding district ta
send in letters protesting against the ban on
margarine. I referred to those letters in a
speech I made in moving the second reading
of the bill. None of the communications
referred to by me at this time have been
solicited by me or anybody else.
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: How can my honourable friend say that these people were not
influenced by that broadcast? How does he
know?
Hon. Mr. EULER: Well, I daresay that the
people in the St. Catharines district were influenced by the broadcast; that was the purpose
of it; but I do not see the relevance of the

457

honourable senator's question to the list of
these national and other organizations which
I have just read.
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: I was not suggesting
that at all. But my honourable friend was
complaining a little while ago about propaganda; ha told us there was a broadcast in
which protests were invited, so I wanted to
know what relation it had to these names.
Hon. Mr. EULER: None whatever.
I shall not delay the bouse much longer, but
I will refer to something that was said, I
believe by the honourable senator from Vancouver (Hon. Mr. MeKeen), as to the reasons
for the introduction of this bill. He said-I am
not using his exact words-that he thought the
fight was not between the butter producers
and the consumers, but between producers and
those who wanted to manufacture margarine.
Hon. Mr. HOWARD: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. EULER: My honourable friend
says "Hear, hear". I do not know whether he
knows why he is saying that; but in that
connection I am going to say something which
I think ought to be said-and I am trying not
to point my finger at my honourable friend.
I believe there have been broadcasts and
debates pro and con as far as margarine is
concerned.
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: You told us that.
Hon. Mr. EULER: But so far as I know, nut
a scrap of printed propaganda bas been issued
by those who, if the manufacture of margarine
were legalized, might want to make it. There
bas been propaganda from the other side. To
the statement that no propaganda on behalf
of margarine bas been issued I should make
one exception. There bas been one little bit of
printed literature-if you want to call it soentitled "The Case for Margarine". It was
gotten out by no other than Senator W. D.
Euler; it was paid for by him, and it cost an
infinitesimal sum. As far as I know, that is all
the money that bas been expended in behalf
of the manufacture of margarine.
Hon. A. L. BEAUBIEN: Has that been
"spread" very much?
Hon. Mr. EULER: I do not think so.
Hon. A. L. BEAUBIEN: I should like to
have a copy.
Hon. Mr. EULER: As I have sponsored this
bill three years in succession, one would suppose that would-be manufacturers of margarine,
if they wanted to press the issue in their own
financial interests, would make some effort to
influence me.
Hon. A. L. BEAUBIEN: Would that not be
lobbying?

SENATE

Hon. Mr. EULER: But I have flot been
approachied by any person within Canada or
the Umnited States who may be interested in
the making of margarine.
Hon. A. L. BEAUBIEN: Would that pamphlet whieh the honourable senator bas printed
corne under the bead of "lobbying"?
Hon. Mr. EULER: I do nlot care w'hat you
eall it. I ar n ot particularly worried about
that.
A word about the Gallup poil. As everybody
konws, a vote was taken not more than two
or thiree weeks ago. In response to a question
subrnitted in April, 1948, to a representative
section of the whole population, not only
people living in the towns and cities, but also
farmers and producers of butter, voted fiftyeight per cent in favour of the sale of margarine and 29 per cent against it. That vote
-was taken, by and large, ail over the country,
including farmers and others. Tivicc as rnany
dcmanded the sale of margarine as opposed it.
In the cities only that is the non-farrn--67 per
ce nt were in favour of it.
Hon. A. L. BEAUBIEN: What percentage
of tilt faviner- voted in favour of it?
Hon. Mr. EULER: Thirty-fo-ur per cent as
against 54 per cent-not very bcavy. It would
be interesting to rny honourable friend to know
that even the farrner's sentiment is -rowing
in favour of margarine. For instance, in 1943
there wcre 25 per cent in favour of the sale
of oleomnargarino, in 1947 there wvere 27 per
cent in favour, in 1918 there were 34 per cent
in favour, and in 1949, 1 think it would probably be 50 per cent.
Hon. A. L. BEAUBIEN: 0f course my
honourable friend knows what happened when
Governor Landon ran against iRoosevelt in
the United States. The Gallup pol did not
arnount to very much.
Hon. Mr. EULER: It w-as not the Gallup
poil at ail; it was the Literary Digest poil.
I do not pay as much attention to American
polities as 1 do to Canadian polities.
lion. A. L. BEAUBIEN: I arn not talking
about ýpolitics; I arn talking about polis.
lon. Mr. EUL.ER: 1 arn sorry. I was looking for a note.
Hon. A. L. BEAUBIEN: My honourable
fricnd can play as much polities as the rest of
us; I can tel] hirn that.
Hon. Mr. EULER: Before I was interrupted
I said that senators are peculiarly qualifled to
judge questions on their merits. I believe that.
If wc feel that it is our obligation to blindly
and unfailingly accpt what is put before us,
thon in mv' opinion the Senate bas ]ost its
usefulness to the country. In any case it is my

humble conýception of the duty of a senator
that he should decide questions on their merits
as bis .iudgment dictates--on principle, remcmbcring that principles are of no value unless
tbey are made to work. In that way senators
can rendýer useful public service. 1 helieve that
the majority of the senators in this chamber
are, on principle, in favour of this bill. I do
not wish in any way to lecture the Sýenate-, but
I believe that in a real sense the Senate of
Canada is, in a measure, on trial this afternoon, not because of the importance of margarine, for it is comparatively unimportant, but
because of the vital democratie principle
involved-the right of Canadians to free coinpetition, free choice, and freedom to make and
buy and seli what they like, without favouring
any ciass, be they farmers, labourers, capitaiists
or anyonc cisc.
I appeai to those senators who believe that
this bill is sound in prinýciple, to support it and
let it go to the House of Gommons, so that the
members of that body may assume the responsibility which is properly theirs. 1 shouid like
bonourable senators to seriotisly consider the
fact that if wc pass this measure and the House
of Commons passes it, we wiil have donc anmething which will meet witb the approval of
the great mass of consumers of this country.
Some hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
lion. Mr. EULER: If we pass this measure
and the House of Commons rejects it, we wiii
at lcast bave donc what wc coi:ld to restore
to the people of this country aomething to
whicb they are entitled; and we will hlave
shown the Canadian people that the Sonate of
Canada instead of being reactionary, as an
often bas heen charged, is concerned with the
good of the common people. If we rejeet this
bill for the third time, 1 say in ail serioýuaness
that so far as the Sonate is concerned the
reaction upon the minds of an indignant and
disappoîntcd people wili be unfortunate and
regrettable to the last degree.

DAIRY INDUSTRY BILL
STATEMENT BY HON. MR. EULER

On the Orders of the Day:
Hon. W. D. EULER: Honourable senators, I
should like to correct what possibly was a
wrong impression given by me in yesterday's
debate. In reply to a question by the
honourable senator from Queen's (Hon. Mr.
Sinclair), I said that I had not taken part
in a broadcast on the subject matter of the
Dairy Industry Bill. Ris question related
entirely to a local broadcasl at St. Catharines,
with which I had nothing to do. I did, however, at the request of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, take part in a national
broadcast along with Mr. H. H. Hannam,
President of the Canadian Federation of Agriculture. Mr. Hannam spoke against the use
of margarine, and 1, of course, in favour of it.

SENATE

PRESS REPORT ON VOTE

On the Orders of the Day:
Hon. JOHN T. HAIG: Honourable senators, I desire to refer to a matter which
should be called to public attention. Most
of this morning's newspapers reported the
names of those who voted for and against
the Dairy Industry Bill; and to that I make
no objection; but they failed to call attention
to the fact that no less than ten members
of the Senate were paired. The impression
created by this omission is that when the vote
was taken only fifty-six senators were in the
chamber. As a matter of fact sixty-six of
about eighty members were in attendance.
I think the press should have carried the
information that ten senators were paired.
The fact was correctly reported in Hansard.
TARIFFS AND TRADE
UNITED

NATIONS CONFERENCE AT GENEVA
CANADA-U.S. AGREEMENT

The Senate resumed from Thursday, April
22, the adjourned debate on the motion of
Hon. Mr. Robert-on:
That it is expedient that parliament do approve the General Agreenent on Tariffs and
Trade, including the protocol of provisional
application thereof, attached to the Final Act
of the second session of the preparatory coummittee of the United Nations Conference on
Trade and Employment held at Geneva from
April 10 to October 30, 1947, together with comnientary agreement of October 30, 1947, between Canada and the United States of
America; that the Senate do approve the sane,
subject to the legislation required in order to
give effect to the provisions thereof.
Hon. JOHN T. HAIG: Honourable senators, I do not intend to delay the bouse too
long, because I spoke on the original motion
earlier in the session. On December 15, 1947,
the subject matter was referred ta committee,
where full investigation has since been made
into all phases of the Geneva Agreements. Following the passing of this resolution, a bill
dealing with the whole matter in detail will
come to us from the House of Commons.
At this time I just wisli to say a word or two
about the Geneva Agreements. I wholeheartedly approve of the idea of having agreements
negotiated as they. were at Geneva. I do not
say that I agree with all the results of the
negotiations, but I think that tarif matters
ought to be settled through such negotiations.
I have never been in favour of a general tariff,
open to all countries-and even allowing reductiens of tariff-without any reciprocal benefits.
As we all know, our representatives negotiated
agreements with some twenty-one nations, but

I understand that only seven of these agreements were finally signed. As our representatives repeatedly told us in committee, negotiations with other nations were always opened
with the idea of making an agreement that
would be advantageous not only to the other
country, but to Canada as well. The difficulty
underlying the agreements is that the United
States of America bas a heavy tariff on practically everything. Their president has the
right to reduce the tariff by 50 per cent, but
that is all, and there is always the possibility
that the tariff may be put back where it was
previously. In 1886 Canada had a disastrous
experience with the United States in the matter
of reciprocal agreements.
By and large-though perhaps, not with the
same results-Right Honourable R. B. Bennett,
later Viscount Bennett, as Prime Minister of
this country, negotiated agreements with the
other countries of the British Commonwealth
on the same basis as the Geneva Agreements
were negotiated. The idea was: you give this
and you get that. One point to be remembered
is that when we make concessions to the United
States under these agreements we make them
to all member countries on the same basis.
That is to be expected. I think I speak for a
large number of Canadians when I say that this
is the proper way for a trading nation such as
ours to carry on negotiations of this nature.
That is to say, we make sure that in return
for what we give we get a market which will
correspondingly benefit us.
Honourable senators, I do not think anyone
but the experts appointed by the government
to go into this matter can give the detai!s of
the agreements.
From what I heard these
experts say in committee, it appears to me
that they made a very reasonable transaction.
Whether it wilH prove to be so reasonable when
it is worked out, I do not know. There are no
benefits from the agreements at the present
time, but by reason of entering into them we
have donc two things. First, we have prohibited the export of certain of our goods to
other countries. For example, let me refer to
the breeders, stockers and beef-cattle raisers of
Canada. Originally we had an agreement with
the United States whereby we could send to
that country 200,000 head of cattle a year.
Under the Geneva agreements we have the
right to send 400,000. But we are nat permitting these cattle to be sent to the United
States. You may say, "Oh, yes, Winnipeg. that
is all right; but if we allow 400,000 head of
cattle to be exported to the United States each
year, the price of beef and the cost of living
will go up in this country." My reply to that
argument is this: Why should the beef producers pay a bonus to the rest of us so that

MAY 8, 1948
we may eat beef at haîf the price that it would
bring on the world market? I do not believe
there is any answer to that question. In the
three prairie provinces, in the eastern provinces,
and to some extent in British Columbia, there
are many feeders and stock raisers who would
be deligbted to seil 400,000 head of cattie on
the Arnerican mnarket. As an illustration of
what this means 1 would refer to what rny
friend the junior senator from Vancouver told
us in committee, namely, that under the Geneva
agreements we were al-lowed to send fresb
salmon to the United States. This would mean
that our salmon producers would get a much
higlier price for their produet on the American
market than tbey would in Canada. But the
government placed a restriction on the export
of salmon to the United States because, they
claimed, it would put the British Columbia
canneries out of business. This policy is in
direct opposition to the Geneva agreements.
To my mind it is a short-sighted, policy, and
I do not seýe how honourable senators opposite,
who dlaim to have Liberal principles, can support a situationRiglit Hon. Mr. MACIKENZIE: May I correct my honourable friend? The so-called
junior senator from Vancouver neyer made the
statement that lias been attributed to him. It
was made by the honourable senator from
Burrard.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I thought he was from
Vancouver.
Righit Hon. Mr. MACKENZIE: It is
-Vancouver-Burrard.Hon. Mr. McKEEN: It is Vancouver.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: We have a senior senator
from Vancouver and a junior senator, and now
we have a junior to the junior.
Hon. Mr. MeKEEN: I arn in between.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: I arn from Vancouver
South.
Hon. Mr.:HAIG: As far as I can find, honourable members on the other aide of the
house neyer agree amongst themselves on
an3thing, so I arn not surprised that they disagree on their designations.
Hon. Mr. COPP: There was a aliglit difference on your side yesterday.
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: We do not find the
honourable leader opposite agreeing with
himself from day to day.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I do. There is neyer any
doubt where I stand.
Honourable senators, under the Geneva
agreements we entered into a solemn compact
5853-31

whereby the United States permit us to send
400,000 head of cattle a year to their country;
but at the very same moment an order is
issued prohibiting the export of any cattie
from Canada. The two thing8 are diametrically opposed, and I do not sce how they ean
be reconciled.
Hon. Mr. MacLENNAN: My honourable
friend did not obj ect when the western farmers
were getting millions of dollars, a ahare of
which had to be paid by the people of the
East.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: At the present time the
western farmers are allowing eastern bakera to
make bread from wheat for which the millers
pay only $1.55 a bushel when they ahould be
paying from $2.55 to $3 a bushel for it. The
farmers of the West are losing at least $1.00
a bushel on their wbeat, because the present
government refuses tbem not only the worlM
price, but the new British price for wheat.
These farmers should be able to seli their
wheat to the East under the world price. They
are bonusing all the bread eaters of Canada.
The only compensation that western Canada
bas ever been paid for the basses on wheat policies bas been $30 million to $35 million, when
for a vear or two the government of the day
and the succeeding government held up the
price of wheat, not at a fhigh figure but at a
figure just higb enougli to enable the farinera
to get by.
Hon. Mr. EULER How about the millions
that were paid to the western wheat growers
whG haid-no-crop--only-a partial cropt-Th-at
money came out of the general public.
Hon. Mr. HAIG:~Avery saal part of it. A
considerable percentage cornes from the wheat
producers tbemselves.
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: Only one-third of it.
The rest of it cornes out of the general fund.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: No, it is more than a third.
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: It is about $30 million out of about $90 million.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: But we in the West are
part of the general public, too.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: This thing bas been
going on over a long period of years.
Hon. Mr. EULER: Every year we subsidize
the farmers who bave bad crop failures.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: By giving eastern Canada
wheat at S1.55 during the last four years, the
West lias more than paid back every doll&'
that eastern Canada ever gave to the West.
Some hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.

SENATE

Hon. Mr. HAIG: I have no objection to
Canada selling wheat to Great Britain at $1.55.
My objection is that you people in the East
are not bearing any part of the loss resulting from that transaction. You pull out your
chests and say: "By selling wheat to the British
people ait a low price we are helping them to
get through their emergency". But it is not
you who are helping then ait ail. We in
western Canada are paying the shot. The
sooner Ontario and Quebec ýlearn that Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Alberta, British Columbia,
Nova Scotia, New Brunswick and Prince
Edward Island are part of Canada, the better
it will be for this country.
Hon. A. L. BEAUBIEN: They neyer will
learn that.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Now I come back to my
main point.
Hon. Mr. EULER: Will my bonourable
friend permit me to interrupt him?
Hon. Mr. HAIG- Cert.ainly.
Hon. Mr. EULER: I arn inclined to agree
that the western farmer is paying for something for which the whole country gets credit.
But, if I may use a colloquial phrase, I do
not want my honourable friend to "get away
with" his suggestion that the benefit is ail on
one side. Eastern Canada bas contriblited very
heavily to western Canada.
Rigbt Hon. Mr. MACKENZIE: The converse is true too.
Hon. Mr. EULER: It works both ways.
Hon. Mr. HAIG. Honourable members, I
arn quite wiliing te debate this question with
my bonourable friend froma Waterloo (Hon.
Mr. Euler). I have followed western volities
for forty years. In ail that time 1 have been
either a school trustee at Winnipeg or a mcmber of the Manitoba Legisiature or a p~nator.
Since tbe first of January 1908 1 have neyer
been eut of public office. I arn a Westerner.
All my life, except for a year or two when I
was a baby, bas been spent in the province of
Manitoba. I have taken a very keen interest
in the question of what eastern Canada bas
donc for the West, and-I say this with al
respect-I can find ne record showing that
either Ontario or Quebec ever gave western

Canada one dollar in any forma without getting the dollar back, plus good interest on the
meney. That is the record.
Hon. Mr. EULER: The East and the West
have contributed te each other's developrnent.

Hon. Mr. HAIG: For years we in western
Canada-we Conservatives especially-had a
desperate job trying to justify the policy
which compeiled our people to buy their
goods at high prices in eastern Canada, which
was proteeted by tariffs, and seil their products on the world market, which was free
and unprotected. Whenever there was an election the people said to us: "Why should we
eleet you? Under your policy we have to
pay more than we should for what we buy,
and we get less than we should for what we
seli."
Hon. Mr. EULER: What was your answer
to that question?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: That I thought the good
of ail Canada outweighed the loss. We stood
for that. I do not want anybody to say to me
that western Canada was given something by
ea.stern Canada. because that bas neyer been
true.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I rather like the questions
and interruptions, but they have sidetraeked
me. Let me ceme back to the Geneva agreements.
The Geneva agreements represent -a new
idea, which I like, and I amn willing that they
should have a fair test in this country. We
are a great trading nation. As I have said
before, three out of every eight of our people
depend on world trade. We have got to have
world ýtrade, but it must be earried on in a
way that, while advantageous to the rest of
the world, is not detrimental to any part of
our country or our economy.
Let me say te my honourable friend from
Margaree Forks (Hon. Mr. MacLennan) that
since I came to this house I have got a keen
appreciation of the difficulties under which the
Maritime provinces labour. Formerly I had
neyer understood the question. It would take
a very eloquent speaker to convince me now
that we should net, perhaps, do more for
those provinces than we are doing. As to,
western Canada, if you allow us to have the
benefits of the Geneva agreements, we shall
look after ourselves. Do not make any mistake about that. But 1 amn net sure that the
agreements will help Nova Scotia, New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island. That is a
question which we as senators ought to consider carefully. Let uls net forget that at
the time of confederation it was agreed that
the Maritimes shou]d be represented by
the
of
senators-one-third
twcnty-four
seventy-two enrbcrs of this chamber as at
first constiluted. In time the membership

MAY 6,1948
was increased to ninety-six, in order that the
four western provinces might also have
twenty-four representatives here; so now the
senators from the Maritimes comprise but
one-fourth of our membership.
I shall reserve detailed examînation of the
Geneva agreernents until the bill is brought in.
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: 1 judge frorn rny
honourable friend's concluding remarks that
hie is favourable to the application of the
Geneva agreernents.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Frorn what I know of them
at present, I arn. It is difflouit to answer the
question without reservation, because I have
not seen the bill. However, I like the idea.
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: The principle?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Yes.
Right Hon. Mr. MACKENZIE: Does rny
honourable friend not consider that the tirne
bas corne when the West should have more
senatorial representation?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I have not consulted my
fellow members about thîs, so I can speak
only for myseif. 1 would not vote for a
change in the senatorial representation.
So far as I can judge from reading the
Con!ederationDebates, the Maritime provinces
were induced to corne into the union on the
understanding that their representation in
the Senate would be twenty-four members,
and that Ontario and Quebec would each have
twenty-four representatives here. Later there
was unanimous agreement that the West also_
shold-have fWt-w-nT1-oiir senatos
Honourable senators, because of the question asked me, I should like permission to say
a few words more, although I know that I arn
out of order. The Senate is not supposed to
be a representative ebamber in the samne way
that the House of Commons is. If the Senate
were an elected body, we would have just
the samne situation as they have in the United
States-the Senate would become more powerfui than the other house. The members of
the House of Commoxis are directly responsible to the people, but it is our special funietion to guard the interests of minorities. Sir
John A. Macdonald said that the Senate would
serve to delay action on important questions
until public opinion was settled. That point
was neyer better illustrated than it was in the
Ontario elections of 1943 and 1945. In the 1943
election 34 C.C.Fers and 38 Progressive Conservatives were elected; the reit of the bouse
was made up of Independents and Liberais.
In 1945, the C.C.F. representation was cut
5853-31j

465

down to eight or nine members. That situation indicates to me that after the people had
had a chance to reconsider they decided they
did flot want certain representatives. It seems
to me that our purpose here is to delay legislation until the people have had sufficient time
to consider it properly; but when there *is a
showdown, and the people of Canada say they
want certain measures passed, I do not believe
we should oppose them. Once the citizens of
this country fully appreciate a problern, then
we must obey their will. .My answer to the
question of my bonourable friend is that I
would not change the present senatorial
representation.
Right Hon. Mr. MACKENZIE: I thank my
honourable friend for bis courteous and able
reply. Hie bases the representation allotted to
the Maritime Provinces on certain features
prevailing in 1867, but doca hie flot appreciate
that British Columbia was jnvited to joîn confederation under a definite promise of a certain
readjustment which bas neyer been carried
through?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I quite admit that.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: Order. Honourable senators must realize that they are getting
far away from the subi ect of the debate.
On motion of Hon. A. L. Beaubien, the
debate was adjourned.

TARIEFS AND TRADE
UNITED NATIONS CONFERENCE AT GENEVAAGREEMENT
CANADA-U.S.

On the Order:
Resuming the adjouriied debate on the motion
of the Honourable Senator Robertson-Tlat it
is expedient tbat Parliam-ent do approve tbe
General Agreemnent on Tariffs and Trade, in-

cluding the protocol of provisional application
tlereof, attached to tbe Final Act of tbe
second session of the Preparatory Committee of
tbe United Nations Conference on Trade and
Envploynient held at Geneva from April 10 to
October 30, 1947, together with the complementary agreement of Octoher 30, 1947, between
Caiida and the United States of America; that
tbe Senate do approve the saine, subject to the
legislation required in order to give effect to
the provisions thereof.-Hoourable Menator
Haig.
Right Hon. M.r. MACKENZIE: May I ask
xny honourable friend the leader opposite the
exact status of this resolution?

Hon. Mr. HAIG: I spoke on the resolution
a few days ago, alter which it was adjourned
hy the honourable senator from Provencher

(Hon. Mr. Beaubien) . It should not now appear
in my namne.
Right Hon. Mr. MACKENZIE. Does that
situation deprive any humble member who
cornes here frorn another place of the right to
speak to it?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: No. It is being called now.
Hon. A. L. BEAUBIEN: I adjourned the
debate at the request of the leader of the
house, to give anyone wbo wished to speak to
it an opportunity to do so. If the debate had
flot been adjourned, the item would have disappeared from the Order Paper. My right
honourable friend can go ahead now.
Right Hon. IAN MACKENZIE: Honourable senators, I do not intend to detain this
honourable body very long on tbis most
important subjeet. I do not want to be censoriou s, but I ish to say at once, that in rny
judgment this measure bas received very
tcnuous consideration from. the Senate of
Canada. In my opinion this is one of the
greatest social and economie measures of our
tirne, or of any time, and I must protest that,
except for the speech of rny colleague fromn
Vancouver South (Hon. Mr. Farris), there
bas heen a complete lack of consideration

given to it by the Senate.
I arn surprised that my friend from Ottawa
(Hon. Mr. Lamnbert), who bas as thorough
and comprehiensive a knowhedge as anyone in
this bouse of the background, principles and

the scope of the Geneva agreements, bas not
yet seen fit to give us the benefit of bis advice
with respect to tbern. I arn sure hie will do so.
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: May I ask the bonourable member if he is aware tbat, wben the
resolution introducing tbese treaties wus subrnitted to this bouse, the leader on tbis side
(Hon. Mr. Robertson), the bonourable senator
from Churchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar) and I spoke
very definitely on the subject. I hope to speak
again as the debate goes on.

SENATE
Right Hon. Mr. MACKENZIE: I am reassured by this sign of repentance on the part of
my honourable colleague from OttawaHon. Mr. LAMBERT: There is no repentance.
Right Hon. Mr. MACKENZIE: -and I am
sure the house will listen with great attention
to his contribution. I hope I shall be fortunate
enough to be credited with the suggestion that
he speak again upon this very important mater.
Now let me say a word to the leader of the
opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig). He knows that
I have a great regard for him, and a personal
liking. We are déaling with an economic structure which will affect this nationHon. Mr. HAIG: I do not want to interrupt my honourable friend, but he cannot in
justice criticize me. I spoke on this subject
on December 15, and again last Thursday. For
some reason I am now recorded as having
adjourned the debate, although I did not do
so. As I have discussed the agreements twice
in the same session, I cannot be accused of
neglect.
Right Hon. Mr. MACKENZIE: I accept
unreserv.edly the statement of the leader of
the opposition. The trouble is that some of
us have forgotten what was said, not only
by him but by the honourable senator from
Ottawa (Hon. Mr. Lambert). Both these
gentlemen are experts on tariffs and trade,
and by comparison the rest of us are mere
amateurs. But if the leader of one of Canada's
historie parties can dismiss this tremendous
problem in a few itinerant remarks, he is not
the man I thought he was.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Just a moment. I made
a regular speech on the 15th of December.
My honourable friend must have been in
some other place, or he would have known
that.
Right Hon. Mr. MACKENZIE: Honourable senators, since my appointment to this
chamber I have not been in the other place.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I said I spoke on December 15.
Right Hon. Mr. MACKENZIE: I have
listened to ail my honourable friend's speeches,
and I have enjoyed them al, because he is a
most adroit and alert speaker. But on this subject he has said, in my opinion, nothing at ail.
As a life-long free-trader, and a believer in
the principle and essential importance of the
Geneva agreements, I should like to hear the
honourable leader opposite make a declara-

tion of policy which will disclose where the
Progressive Conservative party stands with
respect to these agreements. I should like to
know whether, in regard to Canada's new
policy of emancipation of tariff agreements
with the freedom-loving nations of the world,
the Progressive Conservative party is in
alliance with those of us of Liberal thought.
Honourable senators, I do not like figures
or statistics, but in order to
develop my
thesis I am going to give Canada's export and
import figures for a few years.
In 1946 our total trade was $4,176 million;
our exports being $2,312 million and our imports
$1,864 million. In 1947 our total trade was
$5.349 million, our exports $2,775 million and
our imports $2,574 million. The favourable
balance of exports over imports was $201
million. While the total volume of trade has
continued to increase, the favourable balance is
tending to disappear because imports, particularly from the United States, have increased
faster than exports. In 1946 Canada's imports
from the United States were $1,405 million,
and her exports to that country were $888
million. This left a deficit of $517 million to
be paid for in some other way than by exports.
In 1947 Canada's imports from the United
States were $1,975 million and her exports to
that country, including re-exports, were
$1,057 million. The unfavourable trade balance
had reached almost $1 billion, $918 million to
be exact.
Honourable senators, traditionally Canada
has had an unfavourable trade balance with
the United States and a favourable trade balance with the rest of the world. Canada's
normal economy requires that she export
approximately one-third of her production-the
classical illustration of our need in that respect
is our inability to consume all our own
wheat-it is therefore essential that her British
and European markets be restored. I am
gradually coming to the genesis of the Geneva
Agreements.
In order that Britain and Europe might
continue to receive from Canada the goods
that they require, and which from the standpoint of our own prosperity it was equally
necessary that we should sell, Canada made a
series of loans to Britain and other European
countries. What were they? This little
country of 12 million people lent $1,250 million
to Great Britain, $242 million to France and
$277 million to other European nations. The
United States also made substantial loans to
Britain and to western Europe. The result of
these loans is that although our exports to
Britain and other European countries have
been going forward in good volume, we have

461J

MAY 10, 1948

been paying for them ourselvea. When Britain
buys wheat or bacon from Canada, the
Canadian goverament pays the farmer, and the
amount is deducted from the loan to Great
Britain.
These loans are rapidly nearing exhaustion.
There is grave doubt about our ability to
extend further credit, even if Britain were
disposed to assume an increase in ber débt.
The essence of Canada's position is that we
are selling on credit and buying for cash, as
we have been doing for five or six or seven
years. We were able to get through the year
1946 successfully because during the war we
ac.cumulated a reserve of gold and Un.ited
States dollars. It will be recalled that the other
evening we had a very interesting speech
about gold by our honourable friend from
Cariboo (Hon. Mr. Turgeon).
The figures showing our reserves of gold
and United States dollars at certain perioda
are significant. Let us see how we went down
almoat to the very point of economic and
financial disaster for Canada. 1 cannot refer
to the measures that were taken with the
United States, because we have already diacussed them this session, but from what I arn
saying one can infer why those measurea were
taken. Listen to these figures of our reserve
of gold and United States dollars:
1939...............S$ 393 million
187 million
1941.................
1,500 million
1945 ................
At the end of 1946 the reserve was $1,237
million, but the stark story of the next _yer
ia -thatVhy ])ecember -of 1947 th amount had
fallen to $502 million. My honourable friend
from Cariboo referred to that s. couple of
weeks ago. In January of 1948 -the reserve
was $514 million. We have reason to believe
that as a resuit of the emergent policies taken
by the administration the figure is now very
much higher. It will be observed that in 1947
we used up more than half of our reserve of
gold and United States dollars.
We have heard accusations hurled acrosa
this chamber that our financial policy was
mis-timed, but let me remind my honourable
frienda that the report of the Foreign
Exchange Control Board, tabled in parliament by the Miniater of Finance when he
presented his budget in 1946, contained these
words:
It is clear that, in the long run, we shal
either have to reduce our deficit with the
United States by selling more to--or apending
less in-that country, or to increase our United

States dollar income from other countries.
If our trade had been permitted to follow
the trend which has been so clearly in effect
aince the end of the war, we should have

arrived in about six montha' time at a position
where we had no reserve of gold and United
States dollars with which to pay for our
imports from the United States. To illustrate
the significance of this position, our importa
from the United States may be classified in

two groupa: those that are essential, and
those that are non-essential. In the essential
group are coal, petroleum produets, cotton,
and the raw mate!rials or semi-manufactured
parts used in Canadian industry. Automobiles, radios, moving picture films, electrical
appliances, and a variety of other commodities may be described as net absolutely
necessary, although admittedly many of them
are useful and others enjoyable. The necessity
for corrective steps at this stage of our history arises from the fact that if we ran out
of the means of paying for our United States
imports, the effects would be felt upon necesaities as well as upon items which, for the
moment, we are considering as non-essential.
Such is the problem which the government has
endeavoured to deal with by the policy
adopted on November 18.
Now I wish to outline the methods adopted
by the government, and I will be brief. They
are:
First, a multilateral trade agreement with
eighteen couatries, representing 70 per cent of
the world'a international trade. I wonder how
many of us recaîl the year 1911, wheu the
battle cry that swept the western prairie was:
"No truck nor trade with the Yankees." Now,
as I 6ay, we have this agreement; yet I have
-ne-t-ard--a-Tory- voiuerase i tisbos
against a new policy

of Liberalism,

which

makes for real freedom of trade and the removal of the fetters which have bound us for
so many years, and now allows us to take -our
rightful place among the freedom-loving nations
of the world.
Second, participation in the development by
the United Nations of a world trade organizatien and a world trade charter under which the
subscribing nations agree to conform to a code
of fair-trade practices.
Third, aggressive measures, by co-operation
of industry and the government, for the increase
of Canadian exporta in dollar markets.
Fourth, co-operation wîth the United 'States
and other countries in the rehabilitation of nondollar markets for Canadian products.
Fifth, restriction of non-essential importa.
Sixth, imposition of an excise tax on a list
of commodities, with a view to curtailing their
sale in Canada.
Seventh, a boan of $300 million from the
United States Export-Import Bank. I cannot
discuas that subj ect because it has been dealt
with previously.

SENATE
Eighth, restriction to a maximum of $150
a year of the amount of American funds which
a resident cf Canada may obtain for pleasure
travel in the United States.
Nin-th, a bonus to stimulate gold production.
In so far as Canada is concerned,' the purposes which the government seeks to accompIish
by the nine items of new policy which I have
enumerated may best be described by dividing
those items into two categories: long-range
policies and short-range measures. These two
categories are so intertwined that we cannot
separate themn from one another. The trade
agreement, the world trade organization, the
promotion of exports and the rehabilitation of
European markets are long-range policies for
the expansion of world trade and of Canadas
share thereof; the restrictions upon imports by
prohibitions and excise taxes, and the United
States Joan, are short-range measures to meet
the iromediate erisis of a shortage of United
States dollars.
There bas heen criticism of the timing of the
annýouneement of these retrictions. It bas
been contended during this debate that if
action bad been taken earlier it would have
prevented the need for such drastie steps. But
I may say that the Minister of Finance clearly
foresbadowed the pending erisis in bis budget
speech of April. 1947. The information is in
the record of the Huse of Commons and is
availahie te, any hionourahie senator who wishes
to read it. The trade conference at Geneva
had just commenced in April of 1947, and it
was then toc early to assume that its efforts
would be .suecessful. There were indications,
but no clear evidence, that the United States
would use its econcinie power for the rehabilitation of Eur-ope.
Any restrictive program
adopted at that time could not have been based
on the assumption that countries representing
70 per cent of the world's trade would agree on
a great trade-liberating policy. On the contrary, the announeement hy an important
trading nation like Canada cf re,.triý!tive policies
would bave seriously hampered the efforts of
our emissaries to bring about an international
program cf expansion.
An emergency policy adopted in April, 1947
could not have had as its foundation any real
and practical assumption that the great and
powerful United States would take constructive measures for tbe rebiabilitation
cf
European markets and European credit. Sueh
a policy, if put into effect at that time, would
have heen cf a very different character from
that wbich bas heen recently announccd.
The cliaracter cf the prcgramn now adopted
was influenced greatly hy two favourable
developments of the past six miontbs--tbe signing cf the multilateral trade agreement at

Geneva on October 30, and second, the strong
indications of general support in the United
States of the Marshall Plan for the rehabilitation cf the distressed areas of Europe.
Canada was able to wait six months because,
through the foresight of the government, we
lhad during the war built up our reserves of
geld and United States dollars from $393
million to $1,500 million. We weathered 1946
wvîth the bass cf only $263 million of that
reserve. The loss in 1947 cf about $700 million
was a very sericus matter. However, it was
net completely disastreus, because the $500
million which remained, and which bas now
heen substantially augmented. is twice as much
as the reserve we had in 1939 or- at any previeus
time in our history. The administration cf
the hour met the problemn of the time with
unflinching courage, and hy taking the only
financial measures available. Two principles
xvere involved: first, te augment our gold and
our reserves; second, te increase our strength
under a long-range policy.
To what do we owe our present strong gcld
reserve?
As one who, witb bis associates,
played some little part in the discussions, I
say we ewe it very largely te the nationalized
Bank cf Canada. We owe it aIse te the
Foreign Exchange Control Board. Both institutions aire nlmest wholly under the management cf the same official. We owe it aIse te,
the friendly co-eperation hetween the Canadian
and the Unitcd States gevernments,
as
exhbited in the Hlyde Park agreement negotiated by Prime Minister King and that noble
statesmen who recently left us, Franklin Delano
Roosevelt, cne cf tlie greatest characters of aIl
time.
By waiting six montbs, we have suffered a
serieus diminution, but net by any means thc
exhaustion. cf our gold and dollar reserve. On
the other hand, we have the great advantage
of hciog able te dovetail our cmergency
measures into a great constructive, world-wide
pregram cf trade expansion, whicb bas every
prospect of being supported hy the wvualth
and the power cf the United States.
It is suggested that since the gevernment
knew the situation April. 1947, it sbould net
have waited until November te net. The gevernmcnt laid the situation clearly bof ore the
people in the Finance Minister's budget
speech. Those whe now say that the government sbculd bave acted in April were aware
of the situation at that time. If ncw, after
the govcrnment bas aeted, tbey ccntend that
the gcvernment sbould bave aeted in April, 1947,
Jet them show their superior wisdom by recalling what action they advoeated or proclaimed
wýhen the faets m-ere placed before tbcm in the
budget of that time.

MAY 10, 1948

When opposition members say that action
sbould have been taken earlier, they concede,
of course, that the action taken is necessary.
If the governifent can be blamed for delay,
then opposition members, who are equally
responsible ta the people, should be able ta
show that iD April of last year they had a
policy which would have solved the problem;
that they placed it bef are the government
and the people, and that it was nat adopted.
Only if tbey are able ta produce a policy which
they advocated at that time are they entitled
ta say that the government delayed unduly.
I intended ta deal with some editorial comment in the Globe and Mail, but in the interests of brevity I shahl leave it ahane.
I believe that every honourable member is
fully aware of the prînciples and the details
of the trade agreement. It is the produet of
mare than twa years' intensive effort on the
part of the participating countries; and Canada's part in these negotiatians has been active
and important. In 1935, when the present gavernment took office, its first and primary
pledge ta the people of Canada was that
it would seek ta re-open the channels of trade
with other countries. Within a few weeks we
signed the trade agreement of 1935 with the
United States of America, which was a precursar of what has happened at Geneva and
what we are considerîng naw.
I am flot gaing ta analyse, in the presence
of those who know them as well as I do, the
four cardinal features of the Ca.nadian tariff
structure. But I draw attention ta the fact
that this tariff revision is not the single
décension -o C a- :-it-isthe joint decision of
the UJnited Kingdom and the other members
of the British Commonwealth who taday enjoy
preferences. I remember that when I was a
young member of the opposition in the other
place, we were bitterly attacked for opposing
tlie Empire trade preferences of 1932. If I am
nat mistaken, one of the opposition speakers
v'entured ta assert the other day that the
present Geneva agreements were a complete
repetition of the Ottawa agreements of 1932. I
maintain the contrary, that they are a complete negation of the principhes which. were
established in this city in 1932. The one policy
la the negation of the other.
I could carry on for a long time, but I think
the bouse is seized of the essential arguments,
so I shahl pass on ta the question of socialism
and contrai. I should like ta give the bouse
actual figures of the costs of management and
governance of iudustry in the U.S.R. as nompared with those in the United States of
America.
If I were unkind, which I hope I am not,
I wouhd quote the variaus statements made by
5853-32

471

Mr. Bracken and others in the last six months
with respect ta contrai and decantral. One day
they are far contrai; the next day for decontrol. I have the evidence of this under my
hand an this table.
Honourable senators, with the mighty
United States at our side and unopposed ta
aur great ideals of economie reform, if ever in
the history of Canada there was an opportunity
ta obtain economie freedom through the great
processes of world association and world government, that apportunity rests now in aur
hands. My plea to this bouse tonight is that
we marcb side by side with the United States
and Great Britain ta formulate a policy of
social and economie freedom which wili bring
brighter and greater days for the children of
Canada.
On the motion of Hon. Mr. Vien the debate
was adjourned.
CANADA EVIDENCE BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. A. B. COPP moved the second reading
of Bill U-9, an Act ta amend the Canada
Evidence Act.
He said: Honourable senators, I believe the
goverfiment leader in this bouse asked the
bonourable senator fromn Vancouver South
(Hon. Mr. Farris) ta explain this bill.
Hon. J. W. de B. FARRIS: Hanourable
senators, when the honourable leader on this
aide (Hon. Mr. Robertson) asked me ta explain
this bill I hesitated at finfsLbecause-I wasa
i-t-tle doubtful about the extension of the practice that had been adoptcd of modîfying an
original principle of aur jurisprudence.
It lias been a basic principle or rule of aur
jurisprudence that the testimony of a husband
against bis wife, or of a wife against her busband, is flot admissible in court. There bave
been very sound reasons of publia policy why
such a rule ahould prevail. After ail, ta compel
a husband or a wife ta testify in violation of
the sanctity of the home, would be quite contrary ta principles of aur jurisprudence that
have been recognized for many years. However, through necessity, from time to time
inroads have been made into this principle.
This bill seeks ta amend that part of the
Canada Evidence Act which provides that, -in
relation ta offences against certain sections of
the Criminal Code, the husband may be a
compellable witness againat the wife, or the
wife s.gainst the husband. In crimes of an
indecent nature and ailier sex offences, a huaband or wif e should properly be permitted ta
testify against the other party ta the marriage.

SENATE

Section 33 of Chapter 46 of the Statutes of
Canada, 1929, sets out the following provision
of the Juvenile Delinquents Act:
(1) Any person, whether the parent or guar-

dian of the chi]d or nlot, m-ho, koowing]y or
wilfully, (a) aids, causes, abets or connives at
the commission by a child of a delinquency; or
(b) does any act producing, promoting, or contributing te a child's being or becoming a juven,
ile delinquent or likely to make any tffiuld a
juvenile delinquent:
shall be liable on sumanary conviction before
a Juvenile Court or a magistrate to a fine not
exceeding five hundred dollars or to imprisonment for a period not exceeding two years or to
both fine and imprisenment.
(2) Any person who, being the parent or

guardian of the child and being able to do so,
knowingly neglecta to do that which would
directly tend to prevent said chi]d being or
becoming a juvenile delinquent...

Not -long ago an Ontario magistrate suggested that in the case of an offence under
this section thcre should be thc same exception to the general rule as applies to the
enumerated sections of the Criminal Code;
and, after investigation, the Attorney General
of Ontario made a recommendation along
this uine to the Minister of Justice, so this
bill cornes here with the joint recommendation of the Attorney General of Ontario and
the Minister of Justice.

Hon. Mr. LEGER: So that would cover
cases under the Criminal Code, quasi crirninal
cases under the provincial act and under
municipal bylaws and ordinances.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: No. This only applies
to the Juvenile Delinquents Act. So far as I
can see, I have read the essential provisions
of that act.
The act is chapter 48 of the Statutes of 1929,
and its title is "The Juvenile Delinquents
Act, 1929." 1 think that answers my honourable friend's question.
Hon. Mr. LEGER: I arn sorry, but I arn
not yet clear about the matter. If the bill
means what I think it means, I should oppose
it, 'but if it means just the opposite of that,
I have no objection. The explanatory note
says:
The purpose of this amendment is to make
the wife or husband a competent and comnpellable witness for the pyrosecution in a charge
against the other under the Juvenile Delinquents Act, chapter 46 of the statutes of 1929.

You will note it says: "under the Juvenîle
Delinquents Act", not, as the amendment
reads, "against the Juvenile Delinquents Act".
The use of the different words causes me to
be confused.

Hon. Mr. LEGER: If this bill is passed, will
it cover ail cases triable under the Juvenile
Delinquents Act?

Hon. Mr. FARRIS: I point out to rny
honourable friend that the Word "against" bas

Hon. Mr. FARRIS: I so read it. It provides
that:
The wife or husband of a person charged
with an offence against the Juvenile Delinquents
Act . . . shaîl be a competent and compellable
witness for the prosecution without the consent
of the person charged.
Hon. Mr. LEGER: The bill uses the Word
"against."~ Does that mean under the set?

no doubt that on several occasions he bas
voted in support of amendments that have
extended the provisions of this subsection.

Hon. Mr. FARRIS: Yes. This evidence
would be admissible only in those cases in
which the husband or wife is charged with an
offence.

Hon. Mr. FARRIS: The subsection wbich
the bill would amend reads at present as
follows:
The wife or husband of a person charged

Hon. Mr. LEGER: I know that.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: This provision would
not apply if anyone else were charged with
the offence. I take it that these words mean
what they say.
In any case where:
The wife or husband of a person charged
with an offence against the Juvenile Delinquents
Act or with an offence against any of the sections two hundred and twoand so forth,
-of the Criminal Code, shaîl be a competent
and compellable witness for the prosecution
without the consent of the person charged.

been in the subsection a long time.

I have

Hon. Mr. LEGER: In answer to that, I
may say that I have not voted at all in
favour of any such amendment. I had occasion to vote on an arndment in 1938, but
I voted against it.

with an offence against any of the sections..
Then a number of sections of the Criminal
Code are enumerated.
shahl be a competent and compellable witness

for the prosecution without the consent of the

person charged.

The ameodment adopts the exact language
that has been in this subsection ever since
its first enactrnent. AIl that the amendrnent
does is to extend the provisions of the subsection to a person charged with an offence
against the Juvenile Dehinquents Act. It
may be that "under" would bave been a better
Word, but "against" bas served the purpose

MAY 10, 1948
for many years and I do not think that in this
context there is mucli difference between the
meaning of the words.
Hon. Mr. VIEN: The honourable senatar
miglit perhaps explamn wliy the explanatory
note indicates that the purport of the bill is
exclusively linked up with the Juvenile
Delinquents Act, whereas the text of the bill
applies to offences against any of the enumerated sections of the Crimninal Code.
Hon. Mr. ASELIINE: That is the law
now.
Hon. Mr. VIEN: Aside from the recommendations of the Minister of Justice and
various attorneys general, is there any good
reason to be advanced for this amendment?
Hlon. Mr. FARRIS: I thought 1 made that
plain. The reason for the amendment is
simply this: where, say, a husband, because
of drinking and not looking alter his family,
is contributing to the delinquency of a child,
it may well lie that his wife is the only person wio can testify against him. It lias long
been felt that if it were not for this sulisection 2 of section 4 of the Canada Evidence
Act, under which a wife can testify against
lier liusband or a husband against his wife
when one of tliem is charged witli an offence
against any of -the sections of the Criminal
Code set out in the subsection, there would
be no way of getting a conviction. Experience
lias suggested that the subsection should be
extended to apply ta the wife or liusband of
a person charged with an offence against the
-Juvenile ~e tcv
I have rend over the various sections of the
Criminal Code that for many years have been
enumerated in this subsection, and I think
there is far more reason for the inclusion of
this amendment than for the inclusion of some
of those sections. For instance, one of the
sections deals witli vagrancy. Well, if I had
been here when there was brouglit before the
bouse a bill ta make vagrancy one of the
offences ns to whidli a wife could testify against
lier liusband, I sliould have been inclined ta
vote against it, because that does not seem ta
me ta be a kind of offence tliat sliould lie
excepted from the general rule.
Hon. JOHN T. HAIO: Honourable senators,
I read tliis bill over carefully the other day and
I have lad difflculty witli it. To be quite
candid, I neyer like any amendment thnt
makes it possible for a liusband and wife ta
testify against ench other.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: I ngree with you.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I feel that way because,
whetlier we admit it or not, the relationship
5853--32J

473

between a husband and wife is a spiritual one.
My experience on a famous committee of the
Senate-a comrnittee of whicli no one wishes
to be a member, but on which sornebody must
serve-lias made me very uneasy about anything that might tend to break up a home. 1
admit that great weight should be given to the
recommendation of the Attorney General of
Canada and that of the Attorney General of
Ontario. I happen ta know bath these gentlemen, as probably we ail do, and 1 amn aware
-that they are high-minded, public-spirited citizens of the very best type. Yet, despite their
recommendations, I think that we have the
responsibility of carefully considering whether
the amendment might flot in some instances
lead to the breaking up of homes. Those of
us who have lived a fairly long life, with
chuld.ren in the family, know that many touchy
domestic situations eau. arise.
I have deep respect for the honourable
senator who moved second reading of the bill,
and I wiIl not oppose the motion; but I think
that if the motion carrnes the bill sliould be
sent to committee, and that the Attorney
General of Canada, who is the Minister of
Justice, should be there to tell us of ail the
implications of the amendment. 1 have some
doubts about it, as I said at the outset, and 1
do flot want to make a mistake. If we were
not satisfied with the minister's explanation in
committee, I wou.ld request that the Attorney
General of Ontario be mnvited to appear and
discuse the matter with us. On this condition
I arn willing to vote for second reading.
flter
e,
F RI:Ionoknw
-Hon.
I arn out of order in speaking again, -but by
way of explanation I wish to say that my
feelings about the amendment were just like
those -of my honourable friend. Last week
when it was sugges;ted that I move second
reading I dchined, as I wanted to look into
the matter. I wou]d suggest that my honourable. friend read the various sections of the
Crîminal Code that are at present enumerated
in the subsection, and maybe then lie wil
decide that it would lie better to strike out
some of those than ta reject this proposed
amendment. It seems to nme that the inclusion
of some of the sections offends against the
principle for whieh we stand.
Hon. Mr. LEGER: Honourable senators, the
prmnciple referred to by the honourable gentleman from Vancouver South (Hon. Mr. Farris)
is stated as folaws ini Phipson on Evidence,
7th edition, page 205:
No husband shall be compellable to -disclose
any communication made tu him by his wife
during the marriage, and rio wife shail be compellable to disclose any communication made to
lier by lier hueband during the marriage.

SENATE
The protection bas been considered requisite
in order to enstire that unlimited confidence between buisband and- wife upon which the happiness of the miarried state and the peace of
familles depend.
As my bonourable friend on the other side
bas well said, that principle has been changed
in some instances, sucb as gross indecency,
seduction, vagrancy, neglect to provide the
necessities of life, abandonment of children of
tender age, rape, bigamy, abduction. Further,
in.1938, it was extended to theft by the husb*and from the wife, or vice versa, when living
separate and apart. I remember very well that
wben the bill to add the charge of theft came
before this bouse it was rigidly opposed by
the late Senator McMeans. I think the bonourable senator frorn Rosetown (Hon. Mr.
Aseltine) spolie againat it wben it was introduced in committee of the whole bouse.
If I understand the bill correctly, it, means
that we are now asked to add to the nine
exceptions already provided for, ail other
offences triable under the Juvenile Delinquents
Act, which comprise offences provided for
under federal statutes, provincial statutes and
municipal by-laws and ordoances. If that is
the correct interpretation of thc bill, I am
strongly opposed te, it. First]y, 1 arn opposed
to it because it makes an exception against
husband and wife under the age provided by
the Juvenile Delinquents Act-I think it is
eighteen years. I sec no reason why we sbould
make such exception. Secondly, it does not
respect the principle to which my learned
friend bas alluded, and whicb I read from
Phipson on Evidence, namely, that it is conducive to the destruction of the home. For
those reasons I arn opposed to the bill.
Hon. Mr. HIOWARD: Question.
Hon. THOMAS VIEN: Honourable senators, 1 share the views expresscd by the leader
opposite (Hon. Mr. Haig) and the honourable senator wbo lins just taken bis seat (Hon.
Mr. Leger). I arn pleascd that the bonourable
senator from Vancouver South (Hon. Mr.
Farris) lias expressed similar misgivings with
respect to applying the principle of this bill
to the many sections of the Criminal Code set
out.
This bill, wbicb was introduced only on
May 5, should stand for a tirne before we are
called upon to express an opinion as to the
principle involvcd. If we adjourned the debate
for a week or so, there would be ample time
for furtber consideration. We may find upon
investigation that we could flot only discuss the
prînciple involvcd at greater length but could
even excînde some of the many sections of the

Criminal Code set out in the bill. Therefore,
I move the adjotîrnment, of the debate.
The motion of Hon. Mr. Vien was agreed to,
and the debate was adjourned.

THE LATE SENATOR JOHNSTON
TRIBUThS TO HIS MEMORY

On the Orders of the Day:
Hon. WISHART MeL. ROBERTSON:
Honourable senators, I regret very much that
il is my responsibility to offlciaiiy inform this
house of the drath of one of our esteemed
colleagues, Honourable John Frederick Johndton,
the
representative
frorn
Centrai
Saskatchewan.
S,'nator Johnsgton was bora of Scottishi
ancestry on July 16, 1876, at Bogart Town,
county of York, Ontario. His father was a
farmer in York and Simcoe counties, and
operated flour and lumber milis in those areas.
Sonator Johnston was educated at Stayner and
Toronto, and in 1908 hie married Ida Coleman
of Biadworth, Saskatchewan. Throughout bis
üarnr lie ivas interested in farming, and speeiaiized in the raising of pure-bred livestock.
In 1914 Senator Johnston was nominated as
Liberai candidate in Last Mountain constitu-

MAY 11, 1948

ency, Saskatchewan, and in 1917 was elected
aiommons, ta whichbch was
to the Houseof
re-elected in 1921, 1925, and 1926. In December af 1926 he became Deputy Speaker of the
House of Gommons. In 1930 he was defeated
in the general .election, but was returncd ta
office in 1935. In 1940 be was again defeated,
and in 1943 was appointed ta this chamber ta
represent Central Saskatchewan. He passed
away suddenly on May 8, 1948, at Regina.
Senatar Jahnstan and I were bath appainted
to this bouse in the same ye-ar, and from that
time on I bad the privilege of enjoying his
close friendship. I often avaîled myseif of bis
gaod judgment, wbicb was formed from a
wide knowledge of publie aiffairs, and I
respected bis many sterling qualities. On my
own behaif, and that of other banaurable
senators wbo may flot have an opportunity to
do0 so personally, I extend ta bis widow and
those who were ciosest ta him, the very
deepest sympathy.
Hon. W. M. ASELTINE: Honourable senstors. the sudden passing of Senator Johnstan
of Central Saskatchewan 'was the cause af much
grief and sorrow ta those who sit on this aide
of the chamber. It is hard for us ta realize
that be was with us no longer ago than Thursday last, at which time he appeared ta be in
excellent bealth. On.ly last week I was talking
ta him about bis plans for tbis year's farming
operations. We were botb very mucb concerned about the flood conditions wbîcb
prevailed. in bis part of Saskatchewan, and in
tbe section where I live, wbich is only some
twenty-five or tbiry miles away from bis home
in Bladworth. In the course of a very interesting talk be told me he was going ta improve
bis livestock, and- run the farm bimgelf.
The bonourable leader af the Senate bas
inentioned that Senator Jobnston was one of
the real old-timers, wbo came ta Saskatchewan
early in the present century. H1e was a borneeteader, a wbeat farmer and a cattie raiser of
distinction. H1e was a politician to boot. H1e
had a sincere love for bis province-I say "bis
province", for altbough be was not born in
Saskatchewan he lived there so m-any years
that we always spoke of hini as a native. I bad
beard of Senator Johnston for twenty-five
years or more before I met bum. Since bis
appaintment ta this chamber I gat ta kn.a'w
bima very well indeed, and came ta learn of bis
many excellent qualities.
In bis political career Senator Jobaston was
an active Liberal. He bad a sincere hatred -for
Socialists. He did not love the 0onservatives
any too well, eitber, but be considered tbem ta
be a leseer evil. From many a platform, wben
he was campaigning for re-election to the

Huse of Gommons, he would tell bis audience
that if tbey were unable ta vote for bim he
boped tbey would vote for the Conservative
candidate, and in. no case for the Socialist.
Althougb be was not pbysically robust, our
late colleaguýe was a curler af note. Even as
late as last winter, in anc of tbe Ottawa curling
rinks, be curled tbree games for me, two of
wbich we succeeded in winning.
I amn &orry indeed that Senator Johnstan will
not be witb us any longer. It is only witbin
the last four or five years, since bis appointment ta the Senate, that I came ta appreciate
fully bis fine cbaracter and unusual ability.
We on this side of the bouse join with all other
mensbers of the Senate in expressing our deepest sympatby ta bis widow and family.
Hon. T. A. CRERAR: Honaurable senatars,
I sbouýld like to join those wbo have preceded.
me in paying tribute ta our late colleague. It
is more than thirty years since I first met
Senatar Johnston. During that period I knew
bim well and enjoyed wbat ta me was a very
fine frîendsbip. bis colleague from Saskatchewan (Hon. Mr. Aseltine) bas already stated
that the late senator was ane of the early
pianeers in tbat province. He went ta the
prairie country in the early days of its developrnent, and experienced ahl tbe ups and
downs associated witb agricultural activities
there. As a good citizen, he took bis part in
the local life af bis community and in the
broader field of public affairs.
It secis ta me tbat no finer tribute can be
paid ta a man than- ta say that be recognized
and discbarged bis public duties and respansibilities. After ail, aur sa-called democratic
form of gavernment rests largely upon that
basis. The late Senator Johnston was anc of
those who at aIl times possess a sense of responsibility in the public affairs af their province and af Canada generally. He was a fine
citizen, unassuming and not pu.sbing biniself
into the limeliglit, but doing bis, duty day by
day as the tasks came ta bim. His passing is
alom ta this bouse.
I join witb the speakers wba have preceded
me in extending ta bis widow and tltase
closely associated witb bim aur heartfelt
sympatby at bis untimely passing.
DOMINION BUREAU 0F STATISTICS
BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. WISHART McL. ROBERTSON
moved second reading of Bill T-9, an Act
respecting the Dominion Bureau of Statisties.
H1e said: Honourable senators, the purpase
af this bill is ta revoke the present Statistics
Act, under wbicb the Dominion Bureau of

SENATE

Statistics eperates, and to replace it with an
up-to-date statute whieh will more adequately
describe the pre-ent functions of the bureau
and the statutory authority under which it
operates.
Since the Statistics Act was passed in 1918
oniy infrequent and miner amendments have
been made. During this time the work of the
Dominion Bureau of Statistics bias grown
considerably; its methods have gained in
efficiency until today it is generally recognized
as one of the foremost statistical units in the
world.
Originally
the bureau was a central
statistical unit acting for ail goveroment
departmnents, so that the demands for statistics from industry and from the government
could be dealt with in a eo-ordinated manner
and be secured without duplication of effort.
This original conception lias stood tho test
of time.
Duiring the past thirty years the need for
statistics lias grown by leaps and bounds.
Modemn industry depends more and more
on accurate statistical information; the larger
responsibility of govemuments in social an 'd
economic fields has made necessary the
accumulation of a vast amouint of new information; and there bias been a growing demand
for statistics on an international scale,' as is
evîienced by the work formcrly donc by
the Legue of Nations and now done by the
United Nations.
The staff of the bureau at present consists

1 think there will be general agreement that
the service rendcred by the Bureau nf

and the country gcncraliy, is of considerable
importance and value.
The bureau now issues 434 regular publications and many special ones, which are in
constant demand. For the period from April
16 te May 8 there were 2,467 requests for
regular publications. In addition, about 500

Tbe amendments containcd in this bill,
which are numerous, are in many mnstances
mcreiy of a dîafting nature, and couid better
be considered in committee. 1 shaîl therefore content myseif witb îeferring f0 oniy the
more important ones.
Tbe present act is defective in the foilowing
respect: first, it does not mention specificaily
many of tbe economie or social fields in whicb
statistical information is now being obtained;
second, no reference is made te a few filds
in wbicb essentiai information is net being
obtained; and third, it, dons net contain
authority for the use of new statistical
techniques, such as sampling.
Some of the remedies proposed by this hiL:
ar:in Section 2, a change in defiiint
give the bureau authority wbicb it dons net
specificaiiy bave at present, te collect statistics
reiating te road and air transport: in Section
4, a clearer definition of the duties of the
Dominion Statistician; aînd je Section 20,
provision for the expansion of tbe authority
te make a census of industry which wili
include other censuses, sucb as those of construction and trading establishments.
A word may aise be said about Section 8,
which give, authority for the use of sampling
techniques. In many cases it is possible without
ioss of accuracy, and with a saving of effort, to
sedure statisties by taking a smali representative sample rather than a cempicte ennuieratien. Under the prescrit section a person couid
plead that lie was being discrirninatcd against
if he were asked questions whidih were net
asked of ahl otheis in the samne tratle or industry.
It is te prevent sueh an objection thaqt the
subsection 2 is added.
In conclusion I may say that the general
effect of the bill will be te liiten the burden
of those who are asked te fill eut questionnaire
foi-ms for the bureau, and te increase the
efficiency with whicli the demand for statistics
can be filied.
Hon. JOHN T. HIAIG: 1 have rend the bill
very carefully, and I think it is aiong the right
lines. To show how accurate sampiing can be,
]et me give one example which occurrcd many
-,,ars ago. and wbich impressed mie very imuch.
In 1927 there was a provincial election in Manitoba. There is a system known as the advance
poil, wbicb operates tbree or four days before
election day. If, for instance, the electiens
were on a Monday, the advance poil would
take place on Thursday, Friday and Saturday
of the previeus week. The ballots cast in that
poil are net counted until after the polîs close
on election day. le 1927, bowever, the returning officer made a mistake and announced the

MAY 11, 1948
resuit of the advance poll the night before the
elections. Those who voted did not include
every class, but were persons in various occupations, whose business took them out of the city.
About 3,000 people so voted. The following
week about 80,000 ballots were cast, and the
top ten candidates on the advance poll were
those who were finally elected. The only
difference between the results of the two polls
was in the order of the last three candidates.
As a candidate on that occasion I was interested in the result of the advance poll and, of
course, very pleased with it.
In reading the bill I was astonished to learn
that statutory provision for sampling had not
been made long ago. I assume that I cannot
refer to what took place in committee, but
I can illustrate what I want to say and still be
within the rules. I should like the bureau to
undertake for me a duty which I think should
be performed. I want to know how many
bank clerks are subject to the Unemployment
Insurance Act, how much they earn each year,
and how much they contribute to the fund.
I should like to have similar information about
law students, lawyers, automobile workers and
all other vocational workers under the categories of the act. Under this bill the bureau
can supply this information; and the reason I
ask for it here is that I have failed to get it
elsewhere. Certain reasons were given for withholding it. I may say that the young man who
addressed us in committee comes from my
part of the country, and I believe he is very
capable. We can get figures on almost everything else we want; I want that information,
and I think the bureau has the right to furnish
it. These facts can and should be obtained
before the next session, so that we may know
how the act affects various classes of workers.
My other question on the same subject is;
What is the cost of the management of the
unemployment insurance scheme in relation to
the amount of business handled?
Hon. Mr. QUINN: The cost of administration?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Yes, the cost of administration; and how much of that cost is actually
chargeable to insurance and how much to
the employment service. I think the Bureau
of Statistics should get those figures for us.
The question is not a political one, the date
can easily be obtained, and I am persuaded
that there is no legal reason, under this bill,
why it should be withheld.
Hon. A. K. HUGESSEN: I have only a
word or two to say about this bill. It is an
expression of appreciation of the extremely
valuable services which the Dominion Statis-

tician and his colleagues perform for this
country. I am sure that my experience is that
of most if not all honourable senators. When
preparing material in connection with almost
any matter in the whole field of the Dominion
Government, and being in need of certain
figures or statistics, all one has to do is to
telephone to the Dominion Statistician, who
before long produces the information required.
I think this is the occasion on which one should
pay public tribute not only to the work of
the department but to the Dominion Statistician and his extremely able staff.
There is one small matter of detail which
I should like to have elucidated if the bill
goes to committee, as I assume it will. Section 26 requires monthly returns by traffic
carriers and public utilities. Under present
conditions public services have to make so
many tax and other returns to dominion and
provincial authorities that I wonder whether
it is necessary from the point of view of the
Dominion Statistician to require a monthly
return from every public utility and traffic
company in the country. If that is unnecessary, I suggest that it is making just that
much extra work.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Will the honourable
gentleman answer a question?
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: Certainly.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Have not most of the
returns likely to be required already been
prepared by these organizations for their own
use?
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: That may be so.
I am simply raising the matter as a question
on which I should like the Dominion Statistician to enlighten us when the bill goes to
committee.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the second time.

ROYAL CANADIAN MOUNTED POLICE
BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. WISHART McL. ROBERTSON
moved the second reading of Bill 211, an Act
to amend the Royal Canadian Mounted Police
Act.
He said: Honourable senators, the main purpose of this bill is to establish a new contributory scheme of pensions for al1 members of
the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. The
details of this pension plan, in so far as is
practicable in view of the special nature of
the service, are similar to those of the civil
service superannuation scheme. The existing
pension plan for retired members of the force,
other than officers, is non-contributory, being
paid for entirely by the government, and there
is a wholly contributory scheme for their
dependents, to which the government contributes nothing. The effect of this bill is to
bring the pension scheme of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police into line with the general
practice under the Civil Service Superannuation Act, and to make the plan applicable to
all ranks. Members of the force who are
covered by the existing scheme have the option
of continuing on the old basis or of switching
to the new scheme, in which case their past

contributions will be credited to them under
the new system. The bill also makes applicable to members of the force, the provisions
of the Pension Act which relate to disability or
death of a member of the armed forces in
peacetime.
In view of the technical nature of the bill,
I shall not attempt a detailed explanation of
provisions which might better be examined in
committee after the Senate has approved the
general principle and given the bill second
reading. I may inform the house that I have
arnanged to have the Minister of Justice and
officials of his department at tomorrow morning's meeting of the Standing Committee on
Banking and Commerce in order to discuss the
Canada Evidence Act. Inasmuch as these
officials also have to do with the administration of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police,
if this bill is now given second reading, I would
move that it be referred to the Standing Committee on Banking and Commerce.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the second time.

Commons wîth Bill1 299, an Act for granting to
lis Majcsty certain sumns of money for the
public service of the financial year ending the
3lst Mirchi, 1949.
The bill was rcad the first time.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: Honourable
senators, wlien shall this bill be read the second
timie?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: With leave of the
Senate, tomecorow.
PENSION BILL
SECOND

READING

Hon. WISHART McL. ROBERTSON moved
the second reading of Bill 126, an Act to
amend tlîc Pension Aet.
He said: Honourable senators, the purpose
o1 this bill is to authorize increnses in the basic
rates of pension for veterans and their depcndents, and to make a number of amendmenýts
of an administrative nature. The new pension
rates, set out in sebedules A and B of the bill,
represent an over-nhl increase of 25 per cent in
the present basic rates. There is a substantial
increase also-from the present limit of $750 a
year to S1,400--in the maximum helplessness

allowvance to totnlly disabled veterans. The
increase in basic rates will add about $18 million
annually to the nation's pension bill, and the
other amcndments will involve an additional
sum of about $660,000, so that the total cost of
pensions will now be about $92 million a ycar.
The bil. embodies most of the recojumendations made by the Special Committee on Vetcra*ns Affairs in another place, wbicb beard
many witnesses and carefullv examined the
entire pension question. As a result, several
long-standing causes of complaint about the
effeet of certain administrative procedures as
te pensions have been corrected.
Rigbt Hon. IAN MACKENZIE: Honourable senat ors. as one who for the last tbirty
yenrs bas biad sometbing te do witb tbe evolution of a systein of pension legisîntion for our
ex-service men and woinen and tbeir depeiidens, I may be pnrdoned if I endeavour briefly
te analyse what I have ne hesitation in referring te as the splendid w-ork donc tbis session
in another place by the non-partisan Coinmiittee on Veterans Affairs. The manner in
wbicb the various committees and botli bouses
of parliament have handlcd all the pcrplexing
and bafling questions associated with veterans
pensions since 1919 bias been a wonderful evidence of compiete political neutrality. I neyer
beard a political considcration introduced. in
nny of ýthe comnmittees on wbicbi I served. I
siould like in a completely non-partis.an way
te pny my respects te the bionourable. and
gallant gentleman m-ho is now Minister of
Veterans Affairs, for the way in wbicb be met
tbe rcquests of veterans' organizations througbeut Canada. It is truc, as we know, that thcy
wore not w'bolhy met., but I think tbe rcsults
m'ore substantially satisfactorv to tbe grent
mai ority of those whîo reprcsentcd the rank
and file of veterans throiigbout Canad-a.
Honourable senators, if the bonourable leader
of the bouse will forgive me, I sbould like to
suppîcînent bis brief outlîne of wbat Canada
has donc and is doing for bier ex-service men.
The main fenture of tbis mensure, and the
(,ne whicb affects tbe grcatest number of
people, is tbc over-all increase-the first since
1925-of 25 per cent in tbe basic rates payable
under the Pension Act. As a general effect
of this mensure, ahI ranks up te and including
tbat of captain wihl now be paid at the new
basic rate, whicb is in excess of the rate now
paid te captains and very near te that wbich
is pnid te those with the rank of major. For
those wbe bold the rank of major or a higher
rank, the basic scahe romains uncbanged; but
if they hav e wvivcs or chihdren, the additional
pension payable on that account will be at
the increased rates.

MAY 13, 1948
The general effect of the changes will be
seen from a table which 1 have before me.
Perhaps I should read it. It is as follows:

Hon. Mr. HAIGO: I do flot wisb to interrupt
my friend, but that information is shown in
the schedules to the bill.
Right Hon. Mr. MACKENZIE: That is true,
but it is a good thing to have the table on
Hlansard. If my honourable friend bas the
samne difflculty that I have in discovering the
bills tbat corne to this bouse, he will agree
that it is preferable to have the information
spread on the record. I wish prcsently to
compare the Canadian rates of pension with
tbosc of the United States, so that our taxpayers wilI know wbat Canada is doing for those
who served in ber armed forces.
As an example of what these changes will
mean, we migbt consider an average Canadian
family consisting of a man, bis wife and three
cbildren. A man wbo is in receipt of total
disability pension receives, under the present
Pensions Act, $137 per month; the new rates
will give bim a montbly income of $171, and
this is entirely free of income tax. Witbîni My
memory that was not always tbe case; tbe
benefit was restored in the year 1942.
The pensionable widow, wbo at presenit
receives $60 per montb, will hencefortb receive
$75 per montb and, if sbe bas any dependent
cbildren, will benefit further by the increase
in the award on their behaIf.
Under the new bill the rates for orpban
children will be, per month, $38 for the first
orpban, $30 for the second, and $24 for each
subsequent one, instead of $30, $24 and $20
respectively, which are the preserit rates.
The present annual liability for ail awards
under the Pension Act, is $73,000,000. The
immediate increa-se ini annual liability to give
effect to this 25 per cent advance is over
$18,000.000, which raises the total expenditure to 891,000,000; and the ancillary shlowances mentioned by my bonourable leader
raise tbis total te about $92,000,000.
Ahi tbese benefits, bonourable senators. are
effective from October 1, 1947. It is boped
that the adjustment cheques will be mailed

in June, and that the June pension cheques
wilI be issued at the new rate.
Anotber very important provision of tbis
bill is the addition to pension which is payable to pensioners who are totalhy disabled
and hehpless, sand in need of attendance.
Serious disability cases of this kind were
eligible for consideration for a helplessness
alhowance, varying from a minimum of $250
per annum to a maximum of $750 ýper annum.
This bill provides for a substantisi increase,
the minimum per annum awsrd now being
$480, and the maximum $1,400. This incresse
bas been the result, largely, of a wonderfully
effective appeal made by a delegation of exservicemen who appeared before tbe Veterans
Affairs Committee. The estimated immediste
incresse in annual liability to give effect to
this amendment alune is 8350,000.
A further smendment of material benefit
has been made to this section. The present
act provides that in the cases of captains,
majors and lieu tenan t-colonels the award of
helplessness allowance shall be on a decreasing scahe. La otber words, tbese officers bave
been penalized for seniority. The new bll
removes this discrimination, and helplcssness
alhowance wilh be paid to eligible cases on
the samne basis, irrespective of rank. Tbe
estimated immediate increase in annual
liability to effect this change is $25,000.
Hononrable senators, another important
feature of the bilh is the advancement of the
marniage deadline fromn May 1, 1944, to May
1, 1948. This applies onhy to world wsr
pensioners. The effect of this change is that
the pensioner, if the marriage bas takeni place
during the four intervening ycars, but prior
to May 1, 1948, is now entitled to an
additional pension on behiaîf of his wife and
cbldren. Honourable senators wilh remember
that the first deadline was introduccd on May
1, 1933, and remained in effect until May 1,
1944, at whicb time the present deadline was
set. The estimated immediate increase ia
annual liability te give effeet to this change
is 860,220.
Honourable senators, another amendment
wbich confers an increase is to be found in
section 12 of the bill. Lt will be remembered,
perbaps, that in tbe past, wben a member of
tbe forces died, leaving a widow and children
entitled to pension, and, in addition, a parent
or parents, the amount whicb couhd be paid on
behaif of eacb parent was limited to $180
per year. In 1944 this amount was increased to
$360, and the bill now before the bouse pro.vides for an increase to an amount not exceed .
ing $480 per annum.

SENATE
Anyone who is familiar with Canadian
pension legislation will remember the arguments advanced for many years in veteran
circles and before parliamentary committees
about the application of the term "wilfully
concealed", which has been in the Pension Act
ever since the original statute of 1919. This
term was inserted with the intention of ensuring that a member of the forces who had
served in a theatre of actual war, and who on
enlistment had wilfully concealed a preenlistment condition, would be entitled to pension for the degree of aggravation only. This
bill provides for the deletion of the words
"wilfully and deliberately concealed" from
section Il (1) (c) of the act.
Two other types of cases are provided for in
the same section of the act. If the condition
*was "obvious" on enlistment, or was "recorded
on medical examination prior to enlistment",
pension may only be awarded for the extent
of the degree of aggravation for those who
served in a theatre of war. A new definition
has been introduced into section 2 of the act,
to clearly define the term "recorded on medical
examination prior to enlistment".
Another important amendment, although it
affects few cases, will be found in section 13
of the bill, which makes provision for the
dependents of veterans who served in Canadian contingents in the South African war.
At the present time the commission is empowered only to supplement an award from
the British ministry on account of death. In
some cases the ministry regulations do not
permit of an award to the dependent, even
though a disability award had been paid during the lifetime of the pensioner. The amendment provides that the dependents of a pensioned member of a Canadian contingent which
served in South Africa shall be placed in
exactly the same position as are the dependents of all Canadians who served during
World War I and World War II with the
forces of His Majesty or His Majesty's allies.
There are a few amendments of an adninistrative and procedural character which result
from recommendations by the commission, and
which will remove administrative and other
difficulties that have been encountered during
the past few years.
Section 4 of the bill provides for an increase
in the salaries of the Chairman, the Deputy
Chairman, and the Commissioners. All told,
honourable senators, it may be said that the
.changes resulting from these amendments to
the Pension Act will be very beneficial. The
amendments arise from the deliberations of a
Special Committee on Veterans Affairs which

heard proposals from national organizations of
ex-service men and the Canadian Pension
Commission.
Honourable senators, I have before me a
table showing the rates of pension paid by
Canada and by the United States of America,
and I think that for purposes of reference it
would be well to have it placed- on record.
With permission of the bouse I will hand these
figures to Hansard,unless honourahle members
desire me to read them.
Hon. Mr. COPP: Just hand them in.
Right Hon. Mr. MACKENZIE: They are
taken from official records, and I vouch for
their authenticity. It will be observed from the
figures that although the United States pension
for a single pensioner or a married pensioner
without children is higher than the Canadian
pension, our scale for veterans with children is
much higher than the American.
(See Appendix at end of today's report.)

Honourable senators, may I conclude, as I
commenced, by voicing grateful appreciation to
the honourable members of another place who
by their splendid service on the special committee have done a great work for Canada.
The task has not yet been concluded, but we
must realize that the costs are going up; and,
after all, no matter how kind of heart we may
be, for a population of about 12,000,000 a pension bill of $91,000,000, along with the other
social obligations, is a fairly heavy load to
carry. But I do not think the cost is too high.
I do not believe that anything we can do here
is too great, too comprehensive or too sincere
for the 1,150,000 grand men who, through the
lean and dark days of war, served Canada
in the cause of freedom, civilization and
christianity.
Hon. G. V. WHITE: Honourable senators,
I do not rise for the purpose of delaying in any
way the passage of this very important
measure. I simply wish to associate myself
with my right honourable friend from Vancouver (Right Hon. Mr. Mackenzie) in paying tribute to the splendid work accomplished
by the Committee on Veterans Affairs of the
other place. It was my privilege to be present
at several of the meetings of that committee,
and I was impressed by the manner in which
its members took hold of the work. I am
sure that the veterans throughout Canada will
have nothing but commendation for the
splendid results which have been accomplished.
My right honourable friend bas deaIt most
exhaustively with the increased benefits to
ex-service men. I am sure that this legislation
will please not only the veterans of World
Wars I and II, but also the people of Canada,

MAY 13, 1948
who I know take a great interest i mxatters
pertaining to veterans. The measure is of
very material benefit flot only to the men
'who served, but also to their families.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the second time.

The Hon. the SPEAKER: When shall the
bill be read the third time?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Tomorrow.
The Senate adjourned until tomorrow at
3 pin.

THE ROYAL ASSENT
The Hon. the Speaker informed the Senate
that hie had received a communication from
the Assistant Secretary to the Governor
General, acquainting him that the Right
Honourable Thibaudeau Rinfret, Chief Justice
of Canada, acting as Deputy of His Exceilency
the Governor General, would proceed to, the

PRAIRIE FARM REHABILITATION BILL
FIRST RiEADING

A message was received fromn the House of
Commons with Bill 282, an Act to amend the
Prairie Farm Rehabilitation Act.
The bill was read the first time.
SECOND READING

The Hon. the SPEAKER: Wben shall the
bill bo rend the second time?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: With leave of the
Senate, I move second reading now. I have
asked the honourable senator from Lethbridge
to explain the bill.
Hon. W. A. BUCHANAN: Honourable
sena)tors,, this is a very simple bill. It covers
the appointment of Director of Rebabilitatien under the Prairie Farna Rehabilitation
Act. Mr. L. B. Thomson, a civil servant for
many yeazs, and latterly superintendent, of
the experimental station at Swift Current,
was selected for the position of Director of
Rehabilitation, and he required assurance
that bis superannuation rights be safeguarded. This bill is the resuit.
As stated in the expla.natory notes:
With the act amended as proposed, appointments to the positions of Director of Rehabilitation. and Associate Director of Rehabilitation
can, with the approval of Treasury Board, come
withiu the provisions of the Civil Service
Superannuation Act.
While I ara on my feet I should like to
say something about Mr. Thomason himself,
because operations irader the Prairie Farna
Rehabilitation
Act
have become
very
important to the agricultural communities in

491

Western Canada and to the pozsible expansion
of irrigation in ail the western provinces,
particularly Saskatchewan and Alberta.
Hon. Mr, HIAIG: We in Manitoba do not
need it.
Hon. Mr. BUCHANAN:
Mr. Thomson
succeeds a gentleman wh.o gained distinction
in the work hie undertook as head of this
organization. I refer to George Spence, a
former member of the House of Commons
and an ex-cabinet minister of Saskatchewan.
Those who have followed the discussion in
the other bouse will know that high tributes
were paid to bis work, even by those who
differ with hini politically.
I have been
closely in touch with operations under the
act during his administration, and I join in
the tributes paid to him. Mr. Spence had
frequent contacts with ail the governments
of the prairie provinces, and by tact and
good judgment he brought. about the very
best of relations between the provinces and
the dominion in 'the operation of ùhis legisiation.
The vacancy in the position of director
occurred through the appointment of Mr.
Spence as one of the members of the Canadian section of the International Joint Commission. For this position I feel that hie is
eminently qualified, 'becaýuse the commission
is to deal with the division of the waters of
international sýtreams in Canada, particularly
in the prairie provinces, and no man knows
more about, those streams and the need for
the protection of Canada's rights in that
respect than Mr. Spence. As a Canadian
mnember of -the commission hae will be sitting
when hearingis take place on -a new application by the United States goviernment for
consideration of the question of the distTibution of the waters of international streanis.
Mr. Thomson, who succeeds Mr. Spence
in ithe position of director, belongs to that
type of civil servant who bas made important
contributions to agricultural resea.ch, fa.rm
management, and ail other sub.jects within the
purview of our agricultural farm service. My
acquainteance with bis work goes back te ithe
time when hie co-operated in establishýing the
experimenital station, now commonly known
as Manyberries Range Experimental Station,
in what I call the largely desert. country of
southeastern Alberta. 'When I visited it
some years ago I found it an oasis ini a
desert. The run-off water of the spring season
was conserved in a reservoir and was inter
spread over a small tarea of land so that
experiments could be made on range grasses.
That is not the only reason for saying this

SENATE

was an oasis in a desert. Around the buildings of this partieular station, situated in what
I say is largely desert country, were trees,
flowers, shrubs, and green grass lawns. Th'ere
had been a complete transformation.
Mr.
Thomson paxticipated in the establishment
of that station, and for that, if no other
reason, I think I can say that he knows the
importance of prairie farm rehabilitation
work.
Honourable senators, this prairie farm rehabilitation work may not be carried out as
quickly as some of us would like. It is
bound to go on for years. At the present
time it is being carried out in the prairie
provinces, but in the future the system may
be extended into other parts of the country.
I am satisfied that Mr. Thomson, who is
taking over this work, will capably and
efficiently fill the shoes of his predecessor. I
do not think there is anything more I need say.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: Will the honourable
senator explain how this measure brings Mr.
Thomson within the civil service?
Hon. Mr. BUCHANAN: I understand, from
the discussion in the other place, that this
legislation brings Mr. Thomson under the
provisions of the Civil Service Superannuation
Act. The explanatory note reads as follows:
With the act amended as proposed, appointees
to the positions of Director of Rehabilitation
and Associate Director of Rehabilitation can,
with the approval of Treasury Board, corne
within the provisions of the Civil Service
Superannuation Act.
I am not in a position to add to the
information given in the explanatory note,
but I may say that in the discussion in the
other house, the appointment of Mr. Thomson
as Mr. Spence's successor was commended
by representatives of all political groups, and
particularly by those from Saskatchewan.
Everyone agreed that no better choice could
have been made.
Right Hon. IAN A. MACKENZIE: Honourable senators, I subscribe to every comment uttered by the honourable senator from
Lethbridge (Hon. Mr. Buchanan) but I find
considerable difficulty in reconciling the terms
of this legislation with what I would describe
as an attempt at an explanatory note. I read
from the bill the following:
Section six of the Prairie Farm Rehabilitation Act, chapter twenty-three of the statutes
of 1935, is repealed and the following substituted
therefor:
6. The minister may appoint a Director of
Rehabilitation and an Associate Director of
Rehabilitation, and such temporary technical
and other officers and employees as he may deern
necessary and expedient for carrying out the

provisions of this Act and the salaries and expenses of all persons appointed under this section shall be fixed by the Governor in Council.
Then I turn to the explanatory note and
I read this:
Section 6 presently reads as follows:
"The minister may appoint such temporary
technical, professional and other officers and
employees as he may deem necessary and expedient for carrying out the provisions of this
act and the salaries and expenses of such officers
shall be fixed by the Governor in Council."
With the act amended as proposed, appointtes to the positions of Director of Rehabilitatien and Associate Director of Rehabilitation
can, with the approval of Treasury Board. corne
within the provisions of the Civil Service Superannuation Act.
I humbly suggest that we should call the law
officers of the Crown who drafted this measure
and ask them if there is not, as there appears
to be, a lack of agreement betwen the explanatory notes and the provisions of the bill. I
say this not in a critical way at all, but simply
because I think we are entitled to know
whether in fact there is a discrepancy.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: It is contemplated
that specific reference to these two positions
will make it possible for the appointees to
continue holding, with the approval of the
Treasury Board, the rights and privileges
attaching to their present positions. Whether
the phraseology of the bill is sufficiently clear
for the purpose is a point on which I am not
at the moment informed.
Right Hon. Mr. MACKENZIE: My humble
opinion is that the explanatory notes and the
bill as now worded are contradictory. I suggest
that this house is entitled to have the law
officers explain the exact legal implications of
the bill.
Hon. JOHN T. HAIG: I find myself in a
little difficulty on the point mentioned by the
right honourable gentleman from Vancouver,
and in order that there may be no doubt as to
what the bill means I would suggest that after
second reading the bill be referred to committee
of the whole house. Then while the bill was
under discussion the leader could have sitting in
front of him for advisory purposes the deputy
minister or a law officer of the Crown. Personally I think the measure is all right as it
is, but it is our responsibility to make sure.
Under the present act the government has
power to fix the terms and conditions of
employment of such temporary technical and
other officers and employees as may be deemed
necessary for carrying out the provisions of the
act, and this amendment simply says that the
government shall have the same power with
respect to the Director and the Associate
Director of Rehabilitation.

MAY 14, 1948
If I may say so-not in a frivolous way at
all-Manitoba could lend Alberta and Saskatchewan a little water right now, if they
happen to need any.
lHon. Mr. BUCHANAN: Alberta bas plenty
of its own.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: We in Manitoba are
greatly interested in the work of the International Joint Waterways Commission, and I
was delighted to hear that Mr. George Spence
was to be appointed to that body. The Red
River rises in Minnesota, a hundred miles or so
south of our boundary, and if in that part
of Minnesota there is a heavy snowfall, as
there was this year, the flood waters pour into
Manitoba in the early spring and cause us a
great deal of trouble.
Saskatchewan and Alberta will really get
the benefit of this legislation. From personal
experience in Saskatchewan, I can say that by
building ponds for conserving the springtime
run-off of water the commission has done a
really first-class job. It has been of great
benefit to the West.
May I digress for a moment to say why I
am in favour of this legislation. Where there
is sufficient waterfall, the benefit of irrigation is very noticeable. I admit that such a
scheme costs money, but one has only to travel
through the district around Bassano and Lethbridge-particularly between Medicine Hat.
and Lethbridge-to appreciate the marvelous
benefits resulting from it. Some miles east of
Lethbridge there are areas which in dry years
are just a desert; but where irrigation has been
practised the land is so developed that it
resembles the Garden of Eden. On my first
trip through that area I was struck by the
marked improvement by reason of irrigation.
I am wholeheartedly in favour of this
legislation.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the second time.
OLEOMARGARINE
PROPOSED INQUIRY

On the Orders of the Day.
Hon. WISHART McL. ROBERTSON:
Honourable senators, before the Orders of the
Day are proceeded with I should like to state
my future intentions about a matter as to
which I have had inquiries from several
senators.
Honourable senators.will recall that the right
honourable senator from Vancouver (Right
Hon. Mr. Mackenzie) stated that in his opinion
the Senate should conduct a full inquiry into
the various questions which had come up for
discussion during debate on margarine. Such

493

an inquiry was not practicable during the consideration of the Dairy Industry bill; but now
that that issue has been voted on, I consider
it my duty as leader of the government in the
Senate to state that I am in agreement with
the suggestion of the right honourable senator as to the desirability of such an inquiry.
I believe that the public are entitled to know
all the facts, and that members of parliament
should have the fullest information possible to
guide them in their future deliberations.
The consumers of Canada are gravely concerned about what many believe to be a denial
of their right to obtain a cheap and wholesome
food as a substitute for butter. The dairy
farmers of Canada are also gravely concerned
about any proposal which, in the opinion of
many, would be distinctly harmful to their
industry. I have studied the question from
both angles as fully as I could, and as I stated
in the debate, the best information I can get
leads me to believe that because of the existing world shortage of fats and oils, from the
effects of which Canada cannot isolate herself,
the removal of the ban on margarine would in
itself give little immediate relief to the
consumer. Some honourable senators and
many people in Canada do not agree with my
conclusions. If I am wrong, the public are
entitled to know in what respect I am wrong;
if I am right, they are equally entitled to have
the facts.
But, honourable senators, there are even
wider reasons why there should be a publie
inquiry into the whole subject-matter. In due
course normal conditions will return, and it is
of the utmost importance that an attempt
should be made to solve, in a constructive way,
a problem about which there has been a wide
difference of opinion for more than fifty years.
There is a rapidly-mounting volume of public
opinion which is opposed to all forms of protection, and those industries in Canada which
have been built up behind protective. walls
should give serious heed to that viewpoint.
Dairying-which is not the only industry concerned-should give heed to this fact, along
with other industries, both primary and secondary. On the other hand, the consumer
should realize that however unwise the protection afforded the dairy industry and certain
forms of manufacturing in Canada was in its
inception, precipitate action to remove all
forms of protection, without corresponding
advantages in export markets, might lead to
a very violent dislocation of our economic
system.
Careful consideration should be given to the
proposal to establish a margarine industry in
Canada, and the utilization by it of domestically produced edible oils. The question of

SENATE

whetlîer or nlot a future margarine industry
and the domestic production of edible oils can
bc undertaken in normal times without tariff
protection against foreign competition should
be carefully considered, along with the effect
that such an undertaking would have on the
price of margarine to the consumer. The objective of the Senate should be to reconcile, if
possible, the conflicting viewpoints of the
varjous interests in Canada. I would hope
that ail interested parties would appear before
a committce of inquiry and give it the benefit
of their advice.
I bave considered suggesting to the house
that this inquiry take place during the present
session, but 1 am of opinion that it is not
practical to do so. The inquiry should be
thorough. This would involve the calling of
witnesses froin ail parts of Canada and the
compilation of the necessary factual information. I do nlot believe that the time remainin- at oui- disposai this session would be sufficient to make such an inquiry fully effective.
The alternative is to hold an inquiry immediately after the opening of the next session
of parliament. For these reasons, I now inform
the bouse and ail other interested parties that,
as presently advised, at the opening of the next
session of parliament I propose to move, in
substance, as follows:
That the Standing Cemrinittee on Natural
Resources be authorized anti directed t0 inquire
into the situation in Canada respecting supplies
of fats and oils including:
(a) imports inito the country from abroad;
(b) allocations of supplies mnade by the Fats
and Ojîs ('ommittee of the International Einergency Food Commiiittee of FAO;
(c) the current production of supplies of
these coinmiotlities within Canada;
(d) the facilities, resources and eapacity nf
Canada to produce increascd supplies of 'fats
and oils; and
(e) mwhat action should be taken to develop
markets -%ithin and witho.ut Canada, for fats
and i ols.
And that the said cominittee report its flndings f0 this bouse;
And that the said corninittee have power to
send for persolns, papers and records.
Hon. Mr. LACASSE: Beautifully wrapped
and shelved.

Hon. Mr. VIEN: Honourable senators, the
othier day I proposed the adjournimeat of the
dobate on this motion. I now suggest that
the debate be further adjourned until we
meet again, and ask that I be aiiowed to make
a brief statement.
Since these agreements werc conciudcd at
Geneva thore bas been a conference at
Havana at whichi flfty-three nations were
represenfed.
I understand that they have
come ta a definite conclusion, and have

MAY 14,1948
adopted what they cati a charter, the effect af
whicb. is to amend ini various minor particulars the agreement and the protocol whicb
this parliament has been asked te ratify. I
have tried ta obtain a copy of the charter,
but I arn advised that it is nlot yet ready for
distribution. My purpose in rising today is
ta ask the leader of the goverirment if he will
take steps ta obtain the distribution of the
charter adopted, wbich, I arn told. bas already
been printed by order af the United Nations
Organization. We should have it before we
proceed with the discussion.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I assure my
honourable friend that I shall ba only too
pleased ta get any information which may
ha available. The reason I delayed furtber
consideration of tbis matter was that 1 desired
ta be in a position to make a clear statement
on the basis of material which wss not then
available ta me. I am content that further
discussion be deferred until after the adjournment.
The Order stands.
APPROPRIATION BILL NO. 3
SECOND READING

Hon. WISHART McL. ROBERTSON
moved the second reading of Bill 299 an Act
for granting ta His Mai esty certain sums of
money for the public service of the financial
year ending the 31st March, 1949.
He said: Honourable senators, this bill, which
is referred ta as Appropriation Bill No. 3,
1947-48, is ai a kind which is frequently presented for aur consideration. It provides for
temporary supply until the estimates have
been considered and passed by parliament.
Provision is made for interim supply.-whicb
cames before us every year from time ta time
during the session-af one-twelftb of the main
estimates, and in certain special items where
expenditure is concentrated in the early part
of the year, of one-sixtb. These special items
are set out in the schedule appended ta the
bill. The amount of money involved in the
grant of one-twelfth is $89,567,384.33, and in
tbe grant af ane-sixtb, $17,982,745.67.
The grant oi one-sixtb covers, specifically,
freigbt assistance on western feed grains,
Senate and House of Commons expenses, the
international trade fair ta be held in Toronto
beginning at the end of May, and the increases
in pensions and war veterans' allowances
approved this session. The sumr total of these
specific items amounts ta $107,96,474, onesixtb of which is $17,982,745.67.
It is hardly necessary ta add that the granting of these sums will not affect the right of
5853-33

any bonourable senator ta raise any question
he sees fit wben the general estimates came
before us in due course.
Rigbt Hon. Mr. MACKENZIE: Honourable
senators, it is my recollection that in one of
the 'Interim Supply Bills a year ago, not anly
were one-twelftb and one-sixtb asked for in
certain cases, but in very special cases parliament was asked ta vote one-third. Are there
any similar items contained in the legisiation
now before this bouse?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: No, I think this
is confined ta the one-twelftb and one-sixtb.
My right honourable friend (Right Hon. Mr.
Mackenzie) is quite right. I remember that
on ona occasion ona-third was asked for
because of some pressing financial need.
Hon. JOHN T. HAIG: Honourable senators,
I do nlot mntend ta delay the bouse at this
time, because the honourable leader gave sufficient explanation when he spoke on the general motion.
I arn sarry that there are not more members
from Ontario and the Maritime Provinces in
the boeuse, because I should like ta draw their
attention ta an item about which tbey questianed me a few days ago. I notice in the
schedule ta this bill the following item,
"Freight assistance on Western Feed Grains".
That is a misnomer, because the item is really
intended ta enable the farmers of Ontario and
Quebec te buy western grain and ta pay little,
if any, freight on it. The proper description
sbould be, "Freight Assistance ta Eastern
Feeders".
The total of almost $8 million is largely
for the benefit of Ontario and Quebec.
Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta do not
get a nickel af that money, nor do they get
a cent more for their coarse grains. I would
be pleased if that $7 million or $8 million wara
added ta what the western farmers receive,
but that money is ta bolster the Ontario and
Quebec farmers so that they can mise their
hogs and fat cattle in conipetition with the
West. They do not have ta pay the freigbt
rate ta get thair fatted hogs and cattle ta
market, whereas the western farmers do. I
shouhd like honourable senators from eastern
Canada ta note this very interesting provision.
My bonourable friend fram Waterloo (Hon.
Mr. Euler) the other day said that we gat
$30 million.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: If the hanourable
leader opposite (Hon. Mr. Haig) would move
ta amend that provision, I would second bis
motion.

SENATE

Hon. Mr. HAIG: I do nlot want ta hurt the
feelings of my friends from Ontario and
Quebec. Those poor chaps are so bard up
that we in the western provinces cannot afford
to be unkind ta tbem, so we Lelp them out ail
we cao. I should nat like it ta Le said that I
accepted charity at the expense of children.

ta establish such a permanent position, and
hence enabie the appointee ta keep bis superannuation rigbts.
I leave it ta tbe bouse ta decide, wbetber
tLat explanation is sufficient.

Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: Camments currently
appearing in the press are ta the effect that
the ban on the shipment of cattie ta the
Uinited States wiIl be removed. If this were
done it would belp ta offset the presenit position of western cattiemen and grain producers.

Rigbt Han. Mr. MACKENZIE: That seems
ta me ta Le a reasonaLle explanation.

Hon. Mr. HAIG: No, Lecause Ontario and
Quebec wouid get the samne benefit as the
western provinces. The western provinces are
not helped at ail by this appropriation; they
are just dead lasers. The people of Canada psy
$8 million a year ta belp the eastern provinces.
Hon. A. L. BEAUBIEN: It is more than
$8 million.

Hon. Mr. HAIG: That is the total for the
year; but oniy one-sixth cames under this bllI.
The motion was agreed ta, and the biii was

Hanourable senatars, before moving third

White we are waiting,

perhaps 1 may read the explanation that Las
Leen banded ta me.
Under the aid section 6, the minister cauld
appoint "sueh temporary technical, professional
and other officers and empioyees .
."but Lie
had no pow er ta appoint permanent civil servants. According ta the Civil Service Act, a
permanent civil servant is one in a position of
"continuing indeterminate employment." Only
permanent civil servants qualify for superannuatian rîghts.
Therefore, under section 6, in order ta
appoint a civil servant wbo could keep bis
superannuation rights, power had ta be given ta
appoint him ta a permanent position. The effect
of adding the words underiined. ". t .may
appoint a Director of Rehabilitation, et

Hon. Mr. HAIG: I think it is, and I arn
satisfied.

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Then, with leave

Hon. WISHART MeL. ROBERTSON:
Honourable senatars, these amendments were
made in anather place, after the bill had gone
through aur (Sammittee on Transport and
Communications and been passed in this bouse.

tious and appropriate way of dealing with them
now would be to refer them ta that committee
for consideratian.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: Could the honourable leader conveniently give a brief
explanation of the amendments, for the benefit
of senators who are flot members of the Transport Committee?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: 0f course, al
senators may attend the committee, whether
they are members of it or not. 1 ar n ot in a
position to explain the amnendments just now,
but I arn perfectly willing to have the motion
stand over until tomorrow.
Hon. M.r. SINCLAIR: The arnendments are
printed in the Minute8.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: I suggest that
the honourable leader move the motion for
reference to committee, as lie intended to do.
Hon. M*r. ROBERTSON: I move that these
amendments be referred ta the Standing Committee on Transport and Communications.
Hon. Mr. PATERSON: As the amendments
are of a minor character, 1 would suggest that
they be explained by the honourable senator
from Toronto (Hon. Mr. Hayden) now. It
rnay not be necessary to refer them ta committee.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I think the leader was
right in asking ta have the amendments
referred ta committee. However, perhaps we
could have an explanation naw, and if some
of them are not clear we could go into Committee of the Whole; then it might nat be
nccessary ta have a reference ta the standing
committee.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: One or two senators had asked specifically that the amendments be referred ta a cammittee, sa that
departmcntal officials could be questioned.
However, I will ask the honourable senator
fromn Toronto (Hon. Mr. Hayden) ta give a
brief explanation of the amendments now.
Hon. SALTER A. HAYDEN: Honourable
members, the amendments are very simple and
do not deal with anything that concerned. us
when the bill was before aur committee in the
first place. For instance, the first amendment
gives a more detailed definition of "sailing
ship" than was in the original bill. The second
amendment provides for the qualification of
a master. It is just as easy ta read this amendment as to try ta explain it. It is as follows:
Every British subject who(a) served as a master of a home-trade, inland waters or minor waters sailing ship of over

SENATE

ten tons, gross tonnage, fitted with mechanical
means of propulsion other than steam engines,
before the first day ef Jauuary, one thousand
nine hundred and forty-eight, for a full period
of twelve months within the years immediately
preceding the date of his application for a certificate of service;
(b) produces satisfactory evidence of his
sobriety, experience, ability and general good
conduct on board ship; and
(c) passes the prescribed examination;
shfihl be entitled, on payrnent of the prescribed
fee, and according to the waters served in, to
either a home-trade, inland waters or miner
waters certificate of service as master of a
steamship of over ten tons, gross tonnage, and
not exceeding one hundred and fifty tons, gross
tonnage, and not carrying passengers. Such certificate shail not be valid on tugs.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: May I interrupt
for a moment?
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: Certainly.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: I think, to regularize oui, procedure, I should put the motion.
It bas been moved hy Honourable Senator
Robertson, seconded by Honourable Senator
Copp, that the ameadments made by the
House of Commons to Bill E-5, an Act to
amend the Shipping Act, be referred to, the
Standing Committee on Transport and Communications. Is it your pleasure, honourable
senators, to adopt the motion?
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE:
serious matter.

This is a very

Hon. Mr. HAYDEN : My honourable
friend snys this is a serious matter. I agree
thnt it is n serious matter to say who shall
he in charge of a ship; but certain limitations
are provided . A person to serve ns masterof a steamship of over ten tons, gross tonnage,
and not exceeding one hundred and fifty tons,
gross tonnage,
-must have certain qualifications and experience, and be is required to pass a prescribed
examination.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE:

Before whom?

lion. Mr. HAYDEN: That would be determined by the (l(partnwnt or someone deputed
by it.
Hon. Mr. BALL.XNTYNE: From my own
cursorv knowledge of the bill and whiat 1
have read in the press, I understand that a
thîrd engineer mav becorne a second engineer.
a second engineer a first engineer. a second
mate a captain. and so on. It is a long
time since 1 was Minister of Marine and
Fisherits, but I assure honourahle senators
that at that time the regulations embodied
in the Canada Shipping Act were rigidly
carried out. It wvas not kift to mie aý minister,

or to any of my subordinates, to, say who
would get a master's certificate or who would
become a chief engineer. It was necessary
that the candidates have certain knowledge
and pass before a special board. As I understand it, it is n0w proposcd to give a master's
certificate to anyone who bas served as master
of a small ship of over ten tons.
Honi. Mr. HAYDEN: No. A person who
within a certain period of time, bas served
as master of a ship of over ten tons shahl
be entithed, if be produces satisfactory evidence
as to personal requirements and passes the
prescribed examination, to a certificate as
master of a ship of over ton tons gross
tonnage and not more than one hundred and
fifty tons gross tonnage, and tbat does not
carry passengers and is limited as to area
of service. Such a certificate shahl not be
valid on tugs.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE:
Would my
honotîrable friend quote the old regulation
and the new one? If a second mate wishes
to qualify as a master mariner, wliat hoard
does lie go hefore, and by wbomn is it constituted? I do not like this loose way of
leaving the responsibility te the Minister of
Transport or his deputy. Navigation is a
serious matter. Further, I shouhd hike 10
know what, the marine insurance companies
have to say about this method of appointing
captains, mates, ebief engineers and so on.
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: If wc are going 10
gel. into a heogthy discussion on the amendments, I think they might as well go to
com mitt ce.
The second amendment proposed in the
other place calîs for the deletion of clause 6
of tbe bihh as passed hv Ibis bouse.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE:
repcaled section read?

llow does the

Hon. Mr. HAYDEIN: It siinply provided
for the repeal of sections 118 and 118A of
the aet. I wilh read these as they were
originally.' before wve dealt withi them. Section
118 is as follows:
Every British subjeet who(1) served as a master or mate of a foreigngoiog or home-trade sailing ship of over seventyfive tons. gross tonnage, hefore the first day of
Janu.ary, one thousand nine hundred and thirtysix, for a full period of twelve months withia
ton years immediately preceding the date of his
application for a cectificate of service;

sobriety, experience, ability and general good
conduet on board ship; and
(3) passes thc prescribcd examinations.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE:
Pardon me
What is the prescribed examination?

JUNE 2, 194
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: I arn now reading
section 118 of the Sbipping Act. This ianguage, I take it, was inserted in the Shipping
Act as a resuit of the bill that went through
this house and the other house some
years ago.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: 1944.
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: The first qualification,
I repeat, is that hie shall haveser-ved as a master or mate of a foreign-going

Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: It is not a question
of delay: it is a matter of my inability to,
further analyse the amendment.

Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: I arn rather
shocked to find that a man, immediately after
baving charge of a ten-ton ship, may be put
in charge of a large sailing ship.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON:
the provision.

No, that is not

larged a bit as a resuît of the amendment;

Right Hon. Mr. MACKENZIE: I amn in
agreement with some of the observations of
the honourable senator from Montreal (Hlon.
Mr. Ballantyne). I amn not familiar with the
rules of this chamber, so perhaps I may have
somne direction from the Chair or from the
leader of the government (Hon. Mr. Robertson) as to whether substantial amiendments
made ini another place to a measure already
considered hy this house, can be introduced
and discus9sed here without notice and without
qualification. 1 raise that question after due
deliberation. I arn as yet unaware of the
exact nature and import of the amendments
made by the other bouse, and I should appreciate a ruling as to whether we are entitled as
a matter of right to refer them hack to a
cornmittee of this house for the purpose of
receiving the necessary full explanation. lIn
this regard I amn in accord with the very able
observations made by the honourable senator
from Montreal.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: I may say that
the usual procedure has been followed. If my
honourable friend will refer to the Minutes hie
will see prin.ted there the amendments made
by the House of Commons to the bill which
was sent to that bouse somn& days ago, and
wbich bas now been returned with two or
three amendmnents.
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: Three.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: It was proposed
by th-e leader of the bouse that these amendments be referred to the standing commîttee
which bas already considered the bill, and
discussion ensued. To regularize proceedings,
1 intervened to caTI attention to the fact that
there was a motion before the boeuse, and
honourible senators are at liberty, if they wish,
to continue that discussion. There is nothîng
irregular in the procedure thus far.

in other respects they are somewhat circumscribed. Before I go into further detail I

my bonourable friend from

or home-trade sailing ship of over seventy-five
tons,

gross tonnage, before the first day of

Janýuary, one thousand nine hundred and thirtysix.

*The change resulting from this amendment
is, that hie shall baveserved as a master of a home-trade, inland
waters or minor waters sailing ship of over ten
tons, gross tonnage, fitted with mechanical
means of propulsion othier than steam engines,
before the first day of January, on1e thousand
nine hundred and f orty-eight.
That is to bring the provision up to date,
and the intent is to decrease the minimum
tonnage qualification, leaving the maximum
tonnage qualification at large. As you wIl
note, the period of service is advanced from
January 1, 1936 to January 1, 1948. The
amendment also provides that the service shall
be for the full terni of twelve months within
the years immediately preceding the date of
application. The law as it stands provides

for a full period of twelve months within the
ten years immedîately preceding the date of
application. There is not too, great a variation
in the language.
The other qualifications are the same as
those contained in subsections 2 and 3 of section 118 of the present act. Subsection 3
also provides that the partyshaîl be entitled to receive from the Minister,
on payment of the prescribed, f ee, a certifleate

of service as a master or mate of a sailing ship
or fore-and-aft irigged sailing ship foreign-going
or homne-trade, not exceeding seven hundred
and fifty tons register tonnage, according as
his service has been
(a) as master or as mate;
(b) on a foreign-going or on a home-trade
sailing ehip;
(c) on a square-rigged sailing ship or on a

fore-and-aft rigged sailing ship.
In some respects the qualifications are en-

must express my regret that I cannot enlarge
on this matter today; I think we shaîl need
to have the officiaIs hefore us.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: I do not want
to delay the honourable senator.
5853-34

Hon. J. J. KINLEY: Honourable senators,
Toronto

(Hon.

Mr. Hayden) said that this bihl had been
dealt witb by a committee of this house and
bad gone to another place, wbere it was
amended. Tbat is so, and perbaps I should
apologize because I was not present wben the

SENATE

bill was in committee, although I had something to say about it whien the bill was before
the Senate for second reading.
These look like good amendments ta me;
they put something into the bill which shouid
bave been in it when it was before us at an
earicr date. I think the bill was framed by
the general staff, as it were, lai an attempt to
make a very strict act; and after the people
interested in the measure were heard it was
somewhat amended.
The first amendment deals with fishing vessels. A lkýhing vessel can be ciassed as a sailing ship if she bas sail enough to make a
voyage. Nearly ail the fishing vessels today
bave auxiliary power, and under the original
act couid be c]assed as steamships. They can
now be classed as sai.iing vessais. Wbether the
amendment goas far enough I do flot know.
It refers to vessais up to 150 tons; but fishing
vesseis are getting larger ail the time, and it
seems ta me that provision should have bean
made for vesseis of 200 tons.
The next amendment deals with the master
in the home-trade service. Hanourabie senators wiiI recail from whiat was said in expianatien hy the honourable senator from Toronto
(Hon. Mr. Hayden) that previousiy a certifieate was required for a 75-ton mater boat or
ship. The tannage bas now been reduced ta
10 tons, which mens that everybody who
sails a b)oat of aver 10 tons wil bo required ta
have a certificate. 1 suppose the intention is
ta put as few as possible out of jobs, and ta
let tlwm ail in with the changing of the act. A
10-tan boat is very small, and to require a
man ta have a certificate to sai] a 10-ton
fishing schoaner in the home-trade, or on
iniand or minar m-aters. may wark a hardship.
Mea of iimited academie training but great
practicai knowicdge hiave bean sailing these
boats in Canada for gencrations. Under the
aid act the tannage xvas reduced ta 75 tons,
and thase seeking certificates were put tbrough
in banches, as it were, in ordar that thora
wouid ba littie interfercace with the coastal
trade af the country. But 1 can see the
fishermen of the Magdaian Islands, the Gaspe
Coast and the Island of Cape Breton, where
they hava smali vesseis, flnding it difficuit to
comply with this act ina the future. It mny ba
that the 75 tans requiremcat wvas right; and
because of tbat and the reasons given by the
hionourable senatars wha have spaken. I tbink
wve should send threse amcndments ta comnnîîttc e, wbore t hey (an he disciuzsü i l fulil.
The motion wvas agrecd to.

TREATIES

0F PEACE BILL

SECOND READING

Hon.
WISHART
McL.
ROBERTSON
moved tbe second reading of Bill 248, an Act
ta provide for carrying into affect the Treaties
of Peace between Canada and Itaiy, Roumania,
Hungary, and Finiand.
Ha said: Honourabie senators, I bave asked
the bonourable senator from Inkerman (Hon.
Mr. Hugessen) ta axplain this bill.
Hon. A. K. HUGESSEN: Honourabia senators, this bill is parhaps not quite so important
as its titie appears to impiy. It is not, of
course, a bill to ratify the treaties between
Canada and tbe diffarent countries that are
meationad in its titie. Honourabie mambers
wiil recail that tbose treatias wera approved
by joint rasolutions of bath bouses at the iast
session of pariiament, in 1947. As the resuit
of tbat approvai, Canada became a party ta
the treaties witli these countries in September
iast, and the faderai governimant is bound by
their provisions.
But individuai citizans of
Canada wbo may ha affected by ana or mare
of the provisions of tbe treaties ara net baund,
bence the neccssity of the bill which is before
us tbis aftarnoon.
I shouid ramind honourabie senators tbat
the saine situation existed after the first Great
War, andh that in the years 1919, 1920, and
1922, bis substantialiy similar ta the ana
now befora us werc passad by this parliament
mn order ta bring into affect, ns regards
nationais of this country, the treatias of peace
whicli bad previousiy been made betwvean
Canada and the variaus anemy beiligerants in
the fiit-t Grcat war.
The bill before us is comparatively simple.
Its aperative provision ivili ha found in section 3, whichi prescrihes that the Govarnor
in Council may mnaka orders and rcguiations
and (Io such things as appear to hiim to ha
nrcessary for carrying out the treaties, and
for giving cffect ta any of tbtir provisions.
Section t provides penalties, by w'ay of fine or
imprisaumient. or bath, against any individuai
vdia vialates sucb orders and regulations.
Section 5 prescribes, vary properiy, that any
orders aor regulations made must ba laid befora
parliament within fiftaen days.
Section 6
declarcs that any expensa incurred in carrying out the treaties shahl ho defrayed out of
monies provided by parliament.
ilonourable senators mig-ht like ta know
Ivý'hat sort of action is contemplated undar this
bill. The treaties, for oe thing, provide that
any prapertv nowv vcstcd in the Custodian
mnay br conflscated and tho, proeds thereof

JUNE 2, 1948
retained by this country and applied to settie
any debts owing to a citizen of Canada as
the resuit of war damage. For instance, a
Canadian citizen whose ship was sunk by
an Italian submnarine would bave a dIaim
for damages against the Italian government.
This could be settled out of the assets of
Italian citizens of this country. A number
of these enemy assets are now held by our
Custodian of Enemy Property.
Hon. Mr. CRERAR: Would flot these debts
be settled out of assets beld, by the Custodian?
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: Yes.
Hon. Mr. CRERAR: You said that they
would 'be settled out of the assets of Italian
citizens.
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: The assets in the
hands of the Custodian. wiIl be realized, and
the procecds wvi11 distributed amongst citibe
zens of Canada who have dlaims against Italy,
for instance. which they are able to prove. This
makes it necessary to set up certain machinery
hy which such dlaims can he filed, their validity
assessed, and the money distrihuted in paynment in foul or, if the assets in the hands of
the Custodian are not sufficient for that purpose, pro rata of the dlaims.
Then there are provisions in the treaties of
peace dealing with patents. There have been
in existence certain Canadian patents in favour
of persons who were formerly enemy aliens.
Some of those patents have been taken by the
Custodian of Enemy Property and disposed of.
The provisions with regard to patents are reciprocalý. There may be Canadians who have
rights in certain patents in another country*
as, for example, Italy. These rights are restored
by the treaties on a reciprocal basis. Therefore, in order to get for Canadian citizens the
benefit of any patents whicb they own in
foreign countries, arrangements would have to
be made to give simular benefits to foreign
citizens in respect of their patents in Canada.
Generally speaking, the purpose of this bill
is merely to deal with dlaims whicb arise
between citizens of the countries that have
been at war. It does not affect the obligations
of the countries that have entered into the
treaties. Those obligations are set out in the
treaties, and by ratifying themn the countries
have become bound te carry out the treaties
in se far as the gevernments themnselves are
concerned.
There is one further matter that may be of
interest to honourable members, and that is
the expense incurred in administering the act.
I arn informed that, judging by experience after
the last war, the expense will be small. Ini fact,
5853-344

practically everything can be done by the
officiais who are at present in the office of the
Custodian, in the Department of the Secretary
of State. It may be necessary, as I said a
moment ago, to appoint one officiai for tihe
purpose of calling for dlaims of Canadian citi.
zens against enemy property, examining those
dlaims, and allocating the property hetween
citizens whose dlaims are ascertained to be
correct.
Hon. Mr. EULER: I sbould like to ask
a question of the honourable gentleman who
hias explained the bill. He states that the
elaims of Canadian citizens may he satisfied
out of enemy aliens' properties in the banda
of the Custodian.
Hon. Mr. HIUGESSEN: That is correct.
Hon. Mr. EULER: Is that the practice in
other countries that were engaged in the war?
I ask that question because of my recollection
of the situation after the first Great War. A
considerable susu of money was ini the banda
of the Custodian at that time--who I tbink
was the Under Secretary of State-but the
amount was not nearly as large as after the
end of this last war. After the first war I was
informed by the Under Secretary of State that
in no country except Canada was the property
of private citizens of an enemy country taken
for the purpose of satisfying the dlaims of anyone else, and that in ail other countries tbis
practice was not regarded as a proper one. Millions of dollars were taken out of the Custo>dian's bands and included in the Consolidated
Revenue Fund of Canada. Tbe Under Secretary of State at that time, Mr. Mulvey, who
is dead and gone now, thought that the principle behmnd that was wrong. I arn wondering
if other countries follow the samne practice as
we do.
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: I amn unable to
answer my honourable friend's question as to
the practice in other countries. Ml 1 can say
is--and I think this follows from what the
honourable senater hiniself bas said-tbat the
practice adopted by Canada after the firat
Great War is being continued under the ne'
treaties. I amn not disposed to agree with my
heneurable friend that the assets in the hands
of the Custodian after this war are much
greater than they were after tbe firet war.
Without having any figures in front of me, I
should thinc that the reverse is true.
Right Hon. Mr. MACKENZIE: Yes.
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: After tbe first war
the Montreal legal firm of whicb 1 was a member acted for the Custodian of Enemy Property in connection witb the seizure of German

SENATE
assets in this country. In those days Germans
had a very large investment in Canadian
,concerus. For instance, they had a very
substantial holding of Canadian Pacifie Railway shares. 1 think that the assets of enemy
natio nals in this country are considerably less
in amount now 'than they were after the first
war.
Hon. Mr. EULER: Would my honourable
friend give me an idea as to what hie thinks
was the amount of the assets in the hands of
the Custodian after this last war? If my
memory serves me right]y, after the first Great
War the amount was around $15 million or $18
million. I arn sure that it was much greater
.after the recent war.
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: I have flot the
figures, but I cen tell my honourable friend
that -aftcr ýthe fluet war the German-owned
.assets which JI, as a mcmber of my law firm,
was responsible for scizing for the Seetary
-of State, were themselves worth a great deal
,more than $18 million. Thcre were several
hundred thousand shares of Canadian Pacific
Railway stock, for instance.
Hon. Mr. EULER: That of course is not
importan t.
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: No, that is flot
important. The prineiple ihet mvy friend was
mentiening depends upon what is implied in
the treaties, whiehi are contracts 'between
governments.
Assuming that a Canadian
citizen lias a clairm againet an enemy goverament because of damage sustained by bim
during the war, it is a matter of cont.ract; the
enemy governiment may -- y, "We wvill aýllow
a
thaft Canadian as a matter of convenience to
collec
bis dlaii
out of assets that our
nationals liappen to have in Canada, and we
wiIl recompense omîr nationale in our own
icounýtry." The procedure is not for the purpose of creating injustice to nation-als of anoither country; it is merely a method by wbich
dlaims of Canadian nationals can be satisfied
in this country. It happens that the present
peace treatice contain the samne provision that
was made at ithe end of the first %var, which
justified and adinitted thiat dlaims of Canadian nationals agqinat. enemy countries should
-as a matter of convenience, I suggest-be
collected eut of assets of nationals of ýthose
enemy countries in Canada, the countries
eoncerned being left to compensa4e thcir ewa
nationals in their own way.
Hon. Mr. EULER: W~hat I was trying to
find out wa-s whether Great Britain and other
countries follow the same practice as we do.

Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: I amn not able to
answer that.
Hon. Mr. KINLEY: Section 4 of the bill
ays:
4. (1) Suhject tn suhRection tivo, the Governor in Couneil mnay preseribe a fine or a terni
of imprisonment or both a fine and a terni of
imprisonment as a penalty for violation of any
erder or regulation, and may also prescribe
whether the penalty shaîl be imposed upen summary conviction or upon conviction under indictmnent or upon cither summary conviction or
conviction unider indictment.
Te that net unusual?
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: It is quite unusual.
I remember that the samne question came up,
I think in the present session, whcn we had
hefore us a somewhat similar measure to
authorize the Governor in Council t.o carry
out the provisions of the United Nations
charter and to provide penalties against
Canadien ci-tizens who violated certain of
those pr'ovisions.
I suppose the only excuse
for the section is that at the moment it is
difficult to say what offences might be coinmitted. and how serieus they might be. Front
what was said in the debate on the bill in
another place, I understand that after the last
war there 'vas a similar provision in statutes
passed then, but that as a matter of faet
there were ne knowvn violations and that ne
penalties were impoeed.
Hlon. Mr. KINLEY: The provision is toned
down in subseotion 2, which says:
(2) The fine preacribed shaîl net exceed one
hunidrcd dollars for aumnmary conviction and one
thotisand dollars fer conviction under indietment and the term of imprisonment prescribed
shaîl net exceed two months for sumimary conviction and two years fer conviction under the
indictment.
Hon. Mr. LEGER: Does this mean that the
Governor in Council may make regulatiens
prescribing fines, or that fines may be impesed
directly by the Governor in Council?
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: I take it te mean
that the Governor in Council would in regulatiens prescribe the fine payable in respect of
violation. I do net think the Governer in
Council could deal with every individual case.

Hon. Mr. LEGER: I amn referring te the
language. I think it should be amended.
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN:
The matter is of
such importance that I think it ought te ho
referred te a committee where the inquiries of
honeurable senators can be enswered. When
the bill lias received second rending I shaîl
move that it be referred te the Standing Cernmittce on External Relations.

JTJNE 2, 1948
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: What offences would
1ikely be deait with under section 4? Would
it be concealing assets or something like that?
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: 1 do not feel
qualified to answer a question of that kind.
The samne sort of provision was inserted in a
bil passed earlier in this session having to do
with the United Nations charter. At that tume
I found some difficuity in imagining what
offences on the part of Canadian citizens might
be anticipated. Howevetr, that feature of this
measure can be deait with when it is referred
to committee.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the second time.

NATIONAL HOUSINO BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON moved second rending of Bill 280, an Act to amend the National
Housing Act, 1944.
He said: Honourabie senators, 1 have asked
the honourable senator from Ottawa (Hon. Mr.
Lambert) to explain this bill.
Hon. NORMAN P. LAMBERT: Honourable senators, a year ago I proposed an amendment to the National Housing Act, to provide
for the extension and enlargement of the
powers and conditions under which lending
institutions could co-operate with the Central
Mortgage and Housing Corporation in undertaking various housing projects.
At that time empliasis was laid upon the
need for so-called rentai housing units as distinguished f.romn home-ownership bouses, and
in accordance with the principle then adopted,
Bill 280 is now introduced as a furtheir attempt
by the government, in the liglit of current
needs and conditions, to carry out the ternis of
the National Housing Act. The bill stresses
the need for rentai housing units. The minister
stated in another place that of 80,000 units
completed in 1947, some 55,000 were homeownership units and 25,000 were Tentai umits.
0f the 25,000 units for rentai, some 14,000 were
built by the government, and less than 11,000
were produced by private enterprise.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Can the honourable
gentleman tell us where those 14,000 houses
are located?
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: A good deal of
information bas been supplied Ito me ini rela-

tion to the discussion of last year, and it ms
tabulated in a number of sheets which I have
in my envelope. It seems to me that such
details as my honourable friend asks, ami
other information which I consider more
important, might better be elucidated by thé
officials of the Housing Corporation when the
bill has been referred to the appropriate comnmittee. If my friend will permit me to continue
my remarks, I thînk hie will have many more
questions to ask later.
It should be said that the Dominion Government is directly in the rentai field because
there are being built only enough rental hou&mng units for veterans' use. It bas been said in
another place that the Dominion Government
would like to wîthdraw from this field, but is
unable to do so until, it becomee evident that
private enterprise can and will produce sufficient rentai holising units.
Honoura-ble memnbers wîll recaîl that rent
control on new units was removed early in
1947. Yet private enterprise does not seem to
be much attracted to thîs particular field.
Undoubtedly there are good reasons for such
reluctance. The most important, apparently,
is that the private capitalist. although lie is
able to secure an economic rental on that type
of investment, apprehends that the day wil
coine when similar rental units will be built at
a lower cost and will come into competition
with his highly capitalized venture, with the
resuit that the builder will lose the equity lie
has established. This bill, therefore, is an
attempt to deal with the continued reluctance
to build and invest in rentai property.
The bill contains two main features. The
first is the introduction of an unprecedented
prîncipie in bouse building, called rental
insurance. The second is the transfer of Wartime Housing Limited to the Centrai Mortgageý
and Hous'ing Corporation. In addition there,
are a nuinher of minor proposais to wbich 1
may refer, but which. certainly can be discussed!
in committee.
Clause 1 of the bill amends section 3 of the
National Housing Act by empowering lending
institutions to invest their funds in the purchase o! mortgages from the Central Mortgage
and Housing Corporation. As section 3 now
stands, approved lending institutions are authorized to lend gnoney up to the amounits specified in the various sections of the act relating
to joint Ioauis. These amounts are 80 per cent
of the iending value of the rentai projects, and
ini the case of home ownership loans, 'the percentage is higlier. As most honourabie fenators
are aware, the amnounta that life insurance companies and trust and boan companies may
invest on the security of a mortgage are
iimited îby their charters and by statute. The

SENATE

amendment is necessary, therefore, to ensure
that in purchasing such mortgages from the
,corporation they will flot be violating any of
these restrictions.
The main feature of the bill is contained in
,clause 2, whicha introduces the principle of
rentai insurance.
By this legisiation the
,corporation-that is the Central Mortgage and
Loan Corporation-wili
be authorized to
guarantee a minimum return of rentais from
a rentai housing project built in accordance
with the terrms of the section. The guarantee
will be given in the flrst instance to the
builder-owner and may bo assigned to subsequent purchasers of tue rentai housing project.
The amounit te, be guaranteed wiii bc sufficient
to pay taxes, debt service, operating expenses,
repairs, renewals and replacements, and a two
per cent return on the equity investment of
the operator. By' these provisions it is hoped
to encourage priv-ate enterprise to build sorto
of our much-needed rentai housing. by providing an insurance against ioss during the terma
of the insurance. and particuiarly against
possible loss resulting fromn the competition of
rentai housing projeets buiit in the future
under more favourabie cost conditions.
Certain ýýtatutory limitations cited in this
ecinshouid he refcrred to. The project
.must conýsist of eight or more units. This
section is designed for proj oct invcstment;
and it i.s feit that, in order to have an
economie operation, the number of units must
-not be icss than eight. The period of the
guarantee cannot exceed thirty years: it may
be for a lesser period in the first instance, with
provision for renewai possîbiy for t-en years,
subject to renewal for twcnty years; but the
full period of thie guarantee cannot ho more
týhan thirty years. The rents to be cha.rged wiii
for the first three years be subject to a ceiling.
This ceiling will bo the economie rent as determined by the corporation, and wviii be based
on the cost of the project. It is feit that the
owner of a project supportied by a government
guarantee should nlot be allowcd to charge
mo>re than the so-called economic rentai.
Another limitation is that the corporation
must approve the location of the project, the
standards of construction, and the sizo and type
of unit. This places a control upon the type
of construction that xviii qualify for the
guarantee, and wiil ensure that the units will
be family units in the moderate field. The
maximum rentai whýich may be charged is,' I am
told, $80 per month. This maximum is for a
fully-serviced unit xvith hot, and coid water,
heating, stove, refrigerator and janitor services.
It is hoped that such fully-serviced units will
be produccd to rent for as littlc, as $55 per

month. Unserviced units wiii have a lower
rentai range, from approximateiy $37 per
monta to $-10 per month.
The section to which I am referring reserves
certain matters to be prescribed by the Gox'ernor in Cooncil. The first is the fixing of the
insurance premnium to be paid by the builder
or suibseqîjent owner.
Wbehn this figure is
determined it xviii be specified in the contract
with the builder. No reguintion of course ('an
be passed until the bill has been assonted to.
Hýon. Mr. HAIG: Before the bonourabie
scnator lbaves that section, will hoe state
wbhether the builder is allowed to include in
the cost of operation the premnium be pays on
that insurance?
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: I understand that the
cost of the premium to the builder wili be
includcd in the termis of the contraet.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: The bill does not so state.
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: No, it does not, but
1 asked that question of officiais with whoni
1 discussed this bill, and my understanding
is that the builder wiil pay bis premium, but
that it wviil be in'ciuded in the statement of
costs.
New section SA pî'ovides that this insurance
shall take the form of a contract between the
corporation and the builder-owner, and that
the guarantee may be givecn after compiction
cf the projeet. In order to enahie the buder
Io finance during the course of construction,
subsection (2) of the bill empowers the corporation to givo to a builder an undertaking
that the insurance wiid be provided if the proect is huilt in accordance with the ternis of
the section. In practice, the builder will submit bis plans and specifications and other relevant details to the corporation before he comnmiences construction, and at, that stage ho
ill be given a commitmnent that if be goes
through with bis project he xviii be given an
insurance contract.
Clause 2 of the bill aiso adds section 8B
to, the set. This enables approvedi lending
institutions to make loans direct to assist the
financing of projeets which quabify foi' rentaI
insurance. There is notbing particularly nexv
in that suggestion, because. I believe, authori7ation was given in the act of last year.
Clause 3 is simply an amendment of section
9 of the act, which deals with loans to, limiteddividend housing companies. As the section
stands, the operators of a limited-dividend
company are, on the sale of the project,
limited to the return of their capital invcstment. plus dividends. which cannot cxceed 5
per cent. It is proposed by the amendment
to permit the operators to retain the residual

JUNE 2,1948
value of the project after the loan has been
repaid. This, in the opinion of the drafters of
the bill, will offer an inducement to engage
more freely in this plan of construction. Section
9 provides for long-term financing at 3 per cent
per annum for a company which provides lowrental housing. It is proposed now to allow
this additional incent-ive to be included in
this legislation.
Clause 4 of the bill simply repeais sectioi
9B of the act which was enacted in 1946. Section 9B, which deait with the powers of the
corporation to administer Crown properties on
an agency basis, is to be repealed, as its provisions are contained in a subsequent section
in the legislation before the house.
Clause 5 of the bill amends section 31A. The
amendment enables the corporation to make
loans to builders of rental housing projects
which qualify for rentai insurance in the terms
of section 8B, with which we have just dealt,
if such loans are not being made by lending
institutions. As honourable members know,
under section 31A as it now stands, if the joint
loans are not being made by lending institutions, the corporation may make such loans.
The terms and conditions of such direct loans
are the same as those specified in the act with
reference to joint loans. The same principle
applies to section 8B, which is referred to in
new section 31A.
I come now to the concluding feature of this
bill, section 6, which deals with the transfer
of Wartime Housing Limited to the Central
Mortgage and Housing Corporation. Honourable senators are familiar with the identity of
Wartime Housing Limited, which operated
under the Department of Munitions and
Supply during the war and for a year or two
afterwards. Ever since January 1, 1946, the
corporation has, under agreement with the
Minister of Reconstruction and Supply,
operateL Wartime Housing Limited on an
agency basis. The personnel of the two corporations bas been identical. The directors of
Wartime Housing Limited are officials of
Central Mortgage and Housing Corporation.
The expenses of Central Mortgage Corporation have been met under the terms of the
agreement with the Minister of Reconstruction and Supply by the payment of a fee. For
all practical purposes, except accounting, the
two organizations are the same. It is now proposed to transfer all the rights and properties
of Wartime Housing Limited to Central Mortgage and Housing Corporation, and to impose
upon the corporation all the obligations of
Wartime Housing Limited. This measure also
empowers the corporation to acquire and
d-evelop land, and to purchase materials and
construct housing, out of moneys froin time to

time appropriated by parliament. This is the
same as the procedure at present followed by
Wartime Housing Limited.
It is also proposed to transfer to the corporation the wartime housing units now held in the
name of the Crown. This transfer may be
effected by order in council, to avoid the not
inconsiderable task of issuing letters patent
with respect to some 40,000 small parcels of
land. Under this measure the corporation is
empowered to transfer these lands, even if they
are registered in the name of the Crown when
they are sold. This will facilitate the operations of the corporation, which is now selling
some 6,000 war-workers' houses. There are a
number of other details concerning this part
of the bill which can be gone into further in
committee.
Honourable senators, I think I have outlined the principal provisions of this bill. One
question is naturally raised, and further inquiry
in committee may elucidate it. I refer to the
element of risk or speculation contained in
this provision for so-called rental insurance.
On what basis or by what criterion can the
Wartime Housing Corporation estimate the
cost of building rental housing or any other
housing unit? The erection of rental housing
will involve the principle of insurance, and
there is the problem of uncertain cost of
materials, the uncertainty connected with
labour, and all the factors that affect any individual who might undertake to build a house
at this time. Another point is that there is
absolutely no precedent to go on in connection
with this proposal. There is no background
of experience by which the Housing Corporation can judge how many rental housing units
will be built under this scheme. What is the
estimate of commitment for rental housing
insurance in the future? It must be remembered that this bill is an effort to meet the
very vital need for rentai housing in this
country, a need which has not been met.
If criticism is to be directed at the housing
policy of the government, it is simply tihat it
has not been able to provide a sufficient number of rental housing units to meet the demand.
The fact is that the number of housing units
erected in Canada during the past year under
government control has exceeded by some
13,000 units the so-called demand from net
family formations. This simply means that
the new housing constructed has been for
ownership purposes. However, th-,e continues
to be a growing demand for rencal housing
units, and it is to meet that need that Bill
280 is presented.

SENATE
Hon. Mr. HUSHION: When the honourabie
senator speaks of insurance, does hie mean
insurance on the rentai of the property?
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: The housing rentai
insurance, as I understand it, is similar to life
insurance. A builder wbo undertakes to ereet
a rentai bousing unit will be given by the corporation a rentai housing insurance poiicy
guaranteeing to him rentais on the basis that
1 have aiready mentioned, whicb covers up
to 85 per cent of the total cost of the work
done. iHe is also free to turn over that
insurance poiicy to a iending institution, if it
wishes to take it. In that way the iending
institution would have the equivalent of a
guaranteed bond to the extent of 85 per
cent of the total investment made.
Hon. Mr'. HIAIG: I arn very stupid and I do
flot understand a certain point in connection
witb this bill. Suppose a man builds a block
of ten units at a cost of $100,000. Under this
bill he gets the guarantee. I may tell my
bonourable friend fromn Victoria (Hon. Mr.
Hushion) that it is not an mnsurance policy
at ail, but a guarantee that this man will get
two per cent net on $85,000. Arn I rigbt?

Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: According to my
illustration that is right.

Hon. Mr. HUSHION: The National llousing A-et was passcd for the purpose of helping
the poor man who bas a family and greatly
needs cither a private or semi-private home.
However, the trouble in Montreal bas been

that the wealtby people have been getting the
preference in the ioaning of this mnoney by
financial corporations and the housing board.

Týhey buy a fine piece of land and erect, perhaps, 50 to 100 apartments on it.

Those apart-

ments are ail in expensive districts and are
fully occupied before completioný; but it is my
contention that they do not heip to solve the
difficulty at whieb the Housing Act is aimed.
If a poor man goes to a bousing company they
wiIl bardly taik to bim, but someone who
wants to borrow baîf a million dollars for the
erection of an apartment will get a good hearing. The existence of all these companies is a
puzzle to me. There ought to, be one company, under one namne, and everybody ought
to be able to get his rights througb that comnpany. I know one man who went to a comnpany, ready to, put up the required ten or
twenty per cent, whatever it is, but bie bas not
got anywhere yet. The people benefiting
under this act are speculators who bave a lot
of money to invest in large apartment buildings. To my mind that is contrary to the
spirit of the act, and something that ought to
be discussed in committee.

Hon. Mr. HAIG: Honourabie senators, if I
were thinking of the interests of the taxpayers,
I would vote unreservediy in favour of this
bill; but if 1 were tbinking of the interests
of people who want to rent bousing accommodation, I wouid vote just as unreservedly
against the bill, because very few bouses for
rent will be built under it.

The only persons

who will build under this bill are conitractors
-I say this witbout reference to anyone in
particular-wbo

tbink they will be able to

get the officiais to put a price of 810,000 on a
bouse that cost oniy $8,000. There are still
some sensible people in Canada, and nobody
in bis senses would build a property to earn

2 per cent wben bie can buy government bonds
that pay 3 per cent.

My bonourable friend from Victoria (Hon.
Mr. Hushion) put bis finger rîght on the
problem. This bill would not give relief to
anyone earning less tban $5,000 a year, and
a person witb tbat income does not need any
relief. But wbat about the people earning
$150 a montb? There are a lot of tbemn in
my home city of Winnipeg. Many of tbe
basic articles of food are produced in abundance near Winnipeg and can be bougbt
cheaper tbere than anywbere else in Canada,
but tbe people witb smali incomes bave no
advantage out tbcre in getting living accommodation. There are plenty of bouses for
the man wbo bas $5,000 a year.
Lust Sunday I drove out to one of the very
nice parts of the city, a section tbat we used
to caîl Elm Park. It is on the Red River,
and when I tell bonourabie senators tbat no
water reacbed it in the recent flood itbey wiIl
understand that the land is pretty bîgb. Tbere
must have been fifty bouses for sale there, at
froma 87,750 to $8,500. Eacb bouse had one
bedroom, but witb an unfinisbed attic that
could be converted into a bedroomn at an extra
cost of $1,000. The general way of caicuiating
wbat a man can afford to pay for a bouse is
by doubling bis annual income. I may say,
if a personal reference is permitted, that I was
in the business nine or ten years, and tbat
wus the standard I always used.
Hon. Mr. PATERSON: Dîd you calcuinte
on twice bis income after or before income
taxes were paid?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: We did flot have beavy
income taxes in those days.
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: I judge that a number of those bouses mentioned by the bonourable gentleman are vacant and ready for sale.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Yes.

SENATE

tunately for me, I have lived in only one city,
but my experience there has taught me that
people do flot build bouses for two per cent
on their money when they can get three per
cent by buying a bond. If certain people do
make investments in that way, they usually
end up in one of our mental bospitals at
Selkirk or Brandon.
This bill is nn admission by tbe government
that its policy of continuing rentai control
bas finally driven it to the point where it is
attempting to get somebody to build rentai
projeets. 1 say that no one will build a bouse
under the piovi.sions of this bill unless lie can
get a valuation higher than the cost of the
building, and interest from the government
on tbat higher amount. I know a builder in
Winnipcg who is now constructing four-room
apartîîîcîts and reuting tbem at $80 a montb,
plus beating, whicb brings the total ta about
$95 a month the year round. The beating cost
will be about $180 for tbe year. Central
beating for my own bouse costs me $240 per
year. One such apartment built near me is
rented to twvo teachers in the Winnipeg sehools.
Tbese young ladies have salaries of $3,000 eaeb
per year, and tbey can afford to rent the
apartmont. But tlîey are not the people I am
interestocl in; my conceru is about the people
my friend fromi Mont real referred to, who earn
$150 or $200 a monith. How can tbey pay that
rent?
Hon. Mr. BURCHILL: WVill tbe bonourable
gentleman permit a question?
Hon. Mr. HIAIG: Yes.
Hon. Mr. BURCHILL: How mnucb a month
can a man making $1,500 a year afford to pay
for rent?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: H1e can afford to pay
twenty per cent of bis income.
Hon. Mr. BURCHILL: Thon wbat is the
answer to the problem?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: That is a fair question.
Hon. Mr. BURCHILL: I should like to bear
the answor to it.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: The first answer is to raise
tbe basic wage rate. If tbere is to be no
reduction in the cost of bousing, tben the
basic wage of the ordinary workman must go
up relatively witb the cost. My second answer
is that rent controls must be removed to permit the building of bouses for these people
witbout interference from anybody.
Hon. Mr. BURCHILL. But tbcy cannot be
built at present-day costs.

Hon. Mr. HAIG: I admit tbat, but this
bill will not correct tbat condition. My third
point is that tbere are plenty of bouses now
being offered for sale. I presumne the situation
is the samne in Tor-onto and Montreal as it
1.5 in Winnipeg.
I am going clown to Montreal
next Tuesday to see for myself; but I feel safe
in saying tbat tbere are rows of unoccupied
bouses for sale. In my own city there are
four hundred such bouses, and I arn sure the
same condition prevails in Montreal.
Hon. Mr. HLTGESSEN: That is not true
of Montreal.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I venture to say that tbere
are four bundred bouses for sale in Montreal
today.
Hon. Mr. HTjSHION: If tbere are, tbere is
some reason for it.
lion. Mr. HAIG: I admit tbat; but I say
the situation wvill adjust itself if you leave it
alone.
Hon. Mr. DAVID: That i.s speculation.
Houses are scarce today and tbe owtiers can
seîl them for double what they cost to build.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Tbat is titie. But if you
take rent controls off. the people will selI the
bouses. and they will be rented as they were
in the uld days. It used to be that wlifn anxy
une had five or six bouses unsold by the first
of Noveinher, be would rent them. kuowing
that bo could get tbe tenants out by the following Soptember and get possession on the
first of October. But we cannot do that todav,
because we cannot get possession. I know of
a menîbor of mny profession îvbo today is renting for S50 a month a bouse that sbould bring
8100. Why should lie considor building a
bouse? He is satisfied to go along at somebodly else's expense.
Hon. Mr. HOWARD: H1e is waiting for the
price to come down.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: If this hill gave abouît ton
per cent to tbe buildor, he mighit co-oporate.
I want to answer my honourablo friend from
Northumberland (Hon. Mr. Burchill) further.
If tbe basic wage rate and. the cost of housing
romain as they are, the people who have money
to invest must contribute in ono way or
another to the building of accommodation for
people who cannot afford it. Wby shouldi the
T. Eaton Company in Winnipeg say they
require tbree thousand people, and then lay off
fifteen hundred to be cared for by the taxpayers of ýthat city? Why sbould tbe Ford
Motor Company in Windsor lay off men for
two months and Jeave them as charges of
that municipality?

JUNE 2, 1948

Hon. Mr. HOXVDEN: If the basic wage
rate goes up. will not housing costs risa
correspandingly?
Han. Mr. HAIG: That may ha so. but the
responsibility wiii be distributed amongst aIl
of us. If living casts rernain at the present
levaI we rnust expect constant agitation, rows
and strikes. The manufacturer munst realize

returned soldier, wha loat a lag in the Italian
campaîgn, called an me. lis wife was with
hîrn, witb thair baby in bar arma. He told me
that thcy bad a certain amount of rnoncy and
wantad ta buy a bouse, but tbay did not
know whPther they bad sufficiant, ta pay for it.
Fortitnately, I was able ta get tbern a bouse,
and they ara very happy about it. None of aur
people should be in need of bornes.
1 shahl say no more about this legislatian,
,excapt that as a means of providing renting
accommrodation it will be an absolute failura.
As an honourabla senator bas rcmarked, a year
ago we were prcsented witb legialation wbich

WVe mrust face up ta the proposition that the
cantrol of anc item of the natianal economy
has repecussions upon aIl the other items;
and the pcohlrni must bcecxamincd witb that
fact in mmnd. Wa bave been rernindcd that
the govcrnent parnittad a 10 par ccnt

raminding tbemn of this provisian; and ana of

Hon. Mr. COPP: Higb taxation, then, helpa
the renter.
Hon. Mc. HAIG: It helpa the renter, but
the ceat of us pay the taxes.
Han. Mc. LAMBERT: There was a point
wbicb I tbaugbt my bonoucable friend was
gaing ta davelop wban he was talking about
the importance of balping peaple ta acquire

513

houses. I refer to bousing subsidies. When the
matter was raised in the other place, the issue
of provincial versus dominion jurisdiction was
brought up. Would my bonourable friend
favour a policy of subsidized housing?
Hon. Mr. HIAIG: As a matter of fact, al
wartirne housing was subsidized by the municipalities. The governrnant built a number of
bouses in Winnipeg-and I presurne almoat
evýerywbere alse-under an agreement wbereby
their obligation for taxes was limitad to $75 per
year. Ordinarily, taxes on this type of house
would be from $100 to $125 a year. The differenca of some $45 which should have been
borne by the owners of the bouses and included
in the rent is paid by the taxpayers in general.
Wbataver ane may think of subsidization,
provided the cost does not fait upon the provinces or the municipalities, it would be more
desirable than the present proposais; and,
spaaking personally-not as leader of the opposition-I would, favour it if the present systema
is to be retained. With rents controlled yau
cannot get houses unless you subsidize thema.
If I were in authority, tha first thing I wauld
do would. be to abolish rent control. I would
give notice that, not immediately, but say on
and from May 1, 1949, rent contrai would
ceasa. Then there would be a reasonahie
chance of ordinary people building praperties
of the type I bave mantioned., for temporary
rentai.
Howevar, I have spoken long enougb. I hope
tbe bill will go to committea. sa that we may
know .what bas been done about the bausing
problern. Althougb this measure offers no solution, the public ougbt ta bave the facts. My
bonourable friand bas said, that 14,000 units
have been built for rentai. That may ha so,
but it is not reflected in conditions in my city.
Hon. Mr. HOWDEN: Quite a number of
blocks have been huilt in Winnipeg for rentai.
Hon. Mr. HlAIG: Not, many; and the faw
whicb are being built wera not begun untîl
aftar rent contrai was relaxed in January of
1947.
Hon. Mr. HOW.DEN: As a matter of fact
tbay are being bujît by small contractars.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: But, I repeat, after rent
contrai was relaxed. Ta the limited extent of
that concession, same good bas been dane.
I know a man wba bas buiit ten four-roomn
apartments since January 1, 1947. 0f course ha

SECOND RiEADING

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON moved the second
reading of Bill J-11, an Act to amend the
Criminal Code (Race Meetings).
Hie said: Honoura;ble senators, the purpose
of this bill is to increase the percentage amount
which racing associations tnay retain from
pari-mutuel betting. These percentages were
set in 1921 on a sliding scale ranging fromn 7
per cent to 3 per cent as the gross amount of
money wagered increased. The percentages
were based on a study of race-track costs and
revenues at that time, and there has been no

This severe reduction in revenues bas beerk
accompanied by higher operating costs of the

tracks. Further, because of the present high
cost of feed, stable keep, etc., the purse money
which the associations must pay to the owner,%
of horses cannut be reduced much below the
1921 level. It is therefore proposed to, give
a measure of relief by increasing the racing.

of the

revenue by 2 per cent over the sliding scale, as

QILS AND FATS
NOTICE OF INQUIRY

Before the Orders of the Day:
Rigbt Hon. Mr. MACKENZIE: Honourable
saenators, I have not yet become familiar with
the procedure in this chamber, but next Tuesday evening I should like ta have the prîvilege
of asking somne twenty-five or tbirty questions,
soine of wbich may require to be passed as
orders for return, dealing substantial-ly with
the question of oîls and fats in Canada and
,other countries. There was recenýtly a discussion on that subi ect in this bouse, but my
questions will, make no mention of that particular discussion.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Does the bonourable
gentleman not intend to put the notice on the
Oirder Paper?
Right Hon. Mr. MACKENZIE: I will be
most happy to do so. Would my honourable
friend be satisfied if it appeared on the Order
Paper tomorrow? I may say that the questions are prepared now, but the answers will
not be oeady.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: As I understand the rules,
the notice should have appeared today; but I
for one am quite willing to waive any tecbnical objection so long as my honourable friend
places the questions on the Order Paper in
timne for study before next Tuesday nigbt.
Right Hon. Mr. MACKENZIE: I shahl be
happy to comply with that request.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: The procedure is
covered by Rule 21. It reads as follows:
When a senator wishes to give notice of an
inquiry or motion, he reduces the notice to
writing. signa it, reads it from his place during
a sitting of the Senate, and hands it in at the
Clerk's table.
I as-sumne that the honourable gentleman
wiil file bis notice and make tbe information
availýable for tbe consideration of honourable
senators.

Right Hlon. Mr. MACKENZIE: Honourable
senators, may I be permitted to make a statement concerning the expedition of business in
this house? I have spoken to the honourable
leader of the government on the matter. The
honourable leader opposite (Hon. Mr. Ha.ig)
quite properly made the comment recently that
there are three or four maj or measures now
being considered in a committee of the other
house. 0f course that committee must report
to that house, which in turn will take such
action as it deems proper.
I wish to stress in a non-partisan way the
importance of expediting the measures being
considered by the Committee on Veterans
Affairs of the other house. To avoid the
criticism frequently made, that the Senate is
the cause of delay in considering legislation,
every attempt should) be made at the earliest
possible moment to enable bonourable senators to familýiarize themselves with 'the termei
of the legisiation which is to come before
them. With ail kindness and respect I would
ask the honourable leader of the government
(Hon. Mr. Robertson) to point out to, his colleagues in the administration the necessity
for placi ng new legisiation before us at tbe
earliest possible moment, so that it may
receive the sympathetic and thorough consideratýion which it deserves.
In accordance with the suggestion made by
the honourable leader opposite (Hon. Mr.
Haig) 1 wish to give notice that on Tuesday
evening next I intend to present a comprebensive proposai for the reform of the rules and
procedure of this chamber.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: I presumne that
the right hourable gentleman wili file notice
to that effect.
Right Hon. Mr. MACKENZIE: It will
appear on the Order Paper in ample time for
consideration.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Honourable members,
smce my friend has referred particularly to
me, may I be permitted to say that we in this
house, because of the practice in the other
place of pushing legislation tbrough in the
laet three weeks of the session, have always
laboured under great difficulties. Ris Honour
the Speaker will recall that when be occupied
the position of leader of the governmnent here

SENATE
every attempt was made to have legislation
brought before us, sometimes unofficially, at
an early date. This house has always consented
unanimously to the subject-matter of a bill
being discussed before the bill came to the
bouse.
I eall the attention of the honourable senator front Vancouver to the fact that this bouse
has always laboured under the difficulty that
the other house, instead of putting through a
limited number of bis and sending them to
us for consideration, advances ail its legislation together. I believe we could give much
better service if their legislation were sent
forward as soion as àt was passcd. If one sits
in the gallery of the other place one will
observe that when an bour or two bas been
devoted to some particular subject, the house
will report progress, ask leave to sit again, and
go on te some other matter. I do flot presume
to criticize this proeedurec but, because of it,
those of us whio have the responsibility of
offering et least some criticisma of goverfiment
legislation are under a tremendous
handicap.'
Although we are now within four weeks
of adjournmont, the major legislation of the
session is not yet before us. I know of
nothing more important than the legisiative
prograrn affecting veterans, yet se far frorn it
having arrived here, it bas flot been taken uip
in the other bouse. The only suggestion I
cani make is that we should fo]low the practice,
introduced by lis Honour the Speaker when
he was leader of ýthe governiment, in this bouse,
of having a committee meet and consider
legislation even though it be flot formally
before us.
Hon. 'Mr. IIAYDEN: It inav be substantiallv changed while in the other place.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I know, but we could at
least consider the principle involv cd. Like
the
honourable senator from Vancouver
(Rigbt lIon. Mr. Mtckcnzie) I have been
nrucb disturbed by thîs state of things. Indeed,
the longer 1 sit here the more I arn disturbed,
because of the reactions I ineet at home. When
I go back te my own people they ask me,
"W/bat, did you say about this niatter and
that
Iae?
replv, "Honr'stiv 1 niust tell
you~ that it did not get before' us until ten
o'cleck in the morning. and wvc adiourned at
six o'clock in the aftei'noon. We did not hae
time to consider it." They sev, "Whîose fanît
is that?", and I tell them, "It is the faunt
of the other place." "The House of Cermeons" is the, expression 1 use when I arn in
my own bailiwick.
Hon. Mr. ELTI.ER: Wiîy net say it here?

the rules .to say it bere.
Right Hon. Mr. MACKENZIE: Arn I permitted to speak again?
The Hon. the SPEAKER: With

loyal opposition in this bouse. Honourable
senators, of course, may and probably will
differ with me, but I wish to have the opportunity of moving a comprehiensive resolution
dealing with the whole structure of the rules
of this bouse. 1 would add at once, with
deference te His Honour the Speaker, because
lie bas net been hiere very long, but longer
then I bave, that the rules of this chamber

Rigbt Hon. IAN MACKENZIE: Honourable senators, may I rise to a question of

inadequacy of the system of filing bis for the

Economy, in co-operation with his honour the

that cornes from the other bouse for consideration each dayý. The only way that I can

I enter this chamber. I maintain that I arn
entitled to have the bills before they are
considered ýby this bouse.

CRIMINAL CODE '(RACE MEETINGS)
BILL
THIIID

READING

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON moved the third
reading of Bill J-11, an Act to amend the
Crirninal Code -(Race Meetings).
The motion was agreed to, and the bill
was read the third time, and passed.
MAIL

CONTRACTS SUPPLiEMENTAL
PAYMENTS BILL
SECOND READING

Hon.,Mr. ROBERTSON moved the second
reading of Bill 3,13, an Act ta amend the Mail
Contracts Supplemental Paym ents Act.
He saidý: The purpose of this bill is to
extend, for one year the authority to pay
supplemental bonuses to rural mail contractors. It wili be recalled ýthat parliament dealt
with this matter last year, and granted
autbority for these payments for a one-year
period. It is hopcd
to get away from

517

these boniuses as soon as possible, but under
presen-t conditions it is considered necessary
to continue them until March, 31, 1949.
As honourable senators know, the usual
procedure in placing contracts for rural mail
delivery is to caTi for tenders. These coutracts are lot for one year, and in most cases
are renewed. at the same rate from year to
year. Otherwise, tenders are again called for
and new contracts are let. During the war
the rising costs of mail delivery and a rising
standard of living made many of the existing
contract rates unprofitable.
In order ta
prevent a *wholesale surrendering of contracts and the consequent calling of new
tenders, which 'would -be unfair to the present
,contractors, the Post Office Department was
given authority to pay supplemental honuses
a!bove the contract rate in cases where it was
satisfied that such honuses were necessary.
This was done first by order in council, and
in 1947 by statute.
These supplements have heen paid on
2,297 contracts, increasing the old eontract
rate of $1,704,248 by 39-3 per cent to,
£2,374,916. In addition, tenders have hèen
calied on 1,032 contracts since April 1, 1947,
and the new rates set by the lowest of these,
tenders have increased the cost of rural mail
delivery hy 37-7 per cent, substantially thre
same percentage of increase as that broughýt
about hy the payment of bonuses.
It is considered that the bonus system hair
served a useful purpose over the years of
rising costs in providing to holders of mail
contracta sorne security -with a reasonable
return. But an early return to the tender
system is desirable, andl accordîngly parliament is being asked ýto authorize these bonus
paymonts for only one more year.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: If I remember what was
said hast year, application bas to ho made forthese supplemental payments. That is to say,
the government dues not inake thein without
request.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: That is rightAnd 1 take it that not ail the requests are
granted, for no doubt the cost of rendering.
these services has been pretty accurately determined over a long period of time. As already
pointed out, where supplementai payments,
have been considered justified the average
rate of increase bas heen approximately tire
same as in the case of new contracts based on
tenders.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the second time.

MARITIME MARSHLAND
REHABILITATION BILL
SECOND READING

McL.
ROBERTSON
Hon. WISHART
moved the second reading of Bill 328, an Act
respecting the Reclamation and Development
of Marsblands in Nova Scotia, New Brunswick,
and Prince Edward Island.
Hie said: Honourable senators. I have asked
the Lonourable gentleman froin Kings (Hon.
Mr. McDonald) to explain this bill. 11e is
keenly interested in the measure, not only
because it affects hais own constituency, as
indeed it affects the constituencies of other
senators fromn the Maritimes, but also because
as Minister of Agriculture in the Goverament
of Nova Scotia Lie was active in the campaigil
on Lehaif of this reclamation projct. It, is a
privilege, therefore, to Lie able to avail ourselves of bis wide knowledge and experience.
(Rings):
Hon. JOHN A. MeDONALD
Honourable senators, I wisb to tbank the
leader of the government for Lis compliment
in asking me to explain this Liil. I know that
the subject-matter of the bill Las been studied
by every senator, and frankly I feed that any
one of my colleagues from the Maritimes could
make a more effective explanation than I can.
I well remember an occasion when the Lonourable' gentîrman froin Westmorland (Mon. Mr.
Copp) took mie over a large section of marshlands on the border between the provinces of
Nova Scotia and New Brunswick and recalled
having seen there in bis younger days luxuriant crops of grass and grain. At the time I
saw the lands thev were producing a sparse
crop, and the senator explained that this was
because the river bcd Liad filled up with sult
deposited over long years by the tides that
come in twice a day.
WhÎle referring to those who have taken a
special interest in the reclamation of these
lands I should like to mention at least two
senators frm parts other fLan the Maritimes.
I think that in ail fairness it should be pointed
out tbat one of the first wbo publicly advocated reclamation ýwas the honourable senator
from Ottawa (Hon. Mr. Lambert), who was
speaking on Lehalf of the Rehabilitation Coinmittee of the Departinent of Agriculture. And
I wish to compliment the Lonourable gentleman from Cariboo (Hon. Mr. Turgeon) wbo,
.as chairman of the Rehabilitation Committee
of the Huse of 'Commons did outstanding
-work in support of the Nova Scotia government's request that sometbing 'Le donc to
develop these rich lands. I think ho will agree
with me that in that matter Lie had the back-

ing of every member of the committee. May I
add that another outstanding contribution has
Leen made by the honourable gentleman who
represents Cumnberland in another place.
Honourable senators, between seventy and
eigbty tbousand acres of marEhlands in the
Maritimes-perbaps seventy tbousand is a
nearer estimate-bave Leen reclaimed froin the

well established when Longfellow's famous
poemn Evangeline was written, in 1757. Describing the dykelands of Grande Pré, Longfellow
says:
Vast mneadows stretch to the eastward, giving
the village its naine, and, pastures to flecks witbout number; dykes that the Land of the farmner
Lds i aised w ith labur incessant shut olit the
turbulenit tides, but at stated seas!ons fioodrgates

Also Thomas -Chandler Haliburton in lis
Sam Slick the Clock-Mokcr compares these
lands v~ery favourably witb the prairies of
Illinois, witb wbich of course the versatile
ndmucb travelled Yankee "Sam Sdick" was
very familiar.
I tbink it is safe to say that these marsblands
-or dykelands, as we prefer to caîl thein
in the Maritimes--are the Lest agricultural
lands that we bave in that part of Canada.
TLey eau Le made to produce very fine crops
of Lay and grain and. wlien well drained, excellent crops of vegetables. TLey are ao Laighly
suitable for pasturage.
The value of thiese lands Lis fluctuated. I
well remnembcr when our first-quality dykeland
sold for as mueb as $300 an acre. Froin twentyfive ycars ago to fifty years ago it was worth
betsween $150 and $200 an acre. Duiring the
past twenty-five years it bas depreciated to a
present value of from $50 to $100 an acre. Of
course, land that is almnost completely waterlogged, and wbere only broadîcaf grows, can
Le bougbt for froin $10 to $25 per acre.
May I Le permitted to relate a personal
experienice îvbicb will illustrate the value of
the dykeland to the farmers in that area?
During the war I received a letter from the
Departinent of Munitions and Supply asking
me to find ont whether or not tbe *Grand Pré
dyke area could hc confiscated and used as a
proving ground for testing live shelîs. M~ot
knowing the source of tbe inquiry, the next
turne I was in Ottawa I called on the officiais
of the departinent, and was inforined that the
recommendation Lad come from two gentlemen froin England wlio Lad fiown over the

JUNE 3, 1948
area from Quebec east ini search of a suitable
field for their purposes. When they got over
the dyke at Grand Pré they looked down on
this large expanse of about 2,300 or 2,500 acres
of what looked like pasture land. It was in
the faîl of the year, and there probably were
a lot of cattle in the fields. It appeared to be
a suitable spot for testing live ammunitien.
I approached these two gentlemen and asked
themn what they expected the land would cost.
They replied that it appeared to be only a
bit of pasture land and should flot cost much.
1 told them in aIl fairness that they would
Iikely have to pay 875 to $100 an acre for it;
furthermore, that they should take into consideration that if that land was converted to
their purposes they weuld destroy a good deal
of farm land in the surrounding area. 1 asked
them where they intended placing their guns
te fire live ammunition. Honourable senators
who are familiar with the location will recognize the position when 1 say that they intended
to place their guns by the Grand Pré park,
just north of the station, and shoot out to
sea. I pointed out that if they punctured
holes in the dyke, follewing the next high
tide even their guns would be covered with
water. I think that incident brings home to
us the value of these marshlands.
In recent years some of the dykes and
aboiteaux have been damaged by constant
pressure from tid-al waters. During the depression years their maintenance was seriously
neglected, and it was in the late thirties that
we first realized that some government action
would have to be taken to save this valuable
property. At that time we formed a cemmittee composed of the Superintendent of the
Experimental Station at Nappan, the Provincial Chemist at the Agricultural College at
Tîruro, who acted as secretary, a representative
from the engineering division of the Department of Agriculture and one from the engineering division of the Department of Highways, as well as a number of representatives
of the farmers. A similar cemmittee was set
up for the province of New Brunswick.
1 should like at this point in my rem.arks to
pay my respects to the Minister of Agriculture
for New Brunswick and his deputy for the
splendid co-operation they have given us and
the Dominion Government in this and other
matters of mutual concern.
In recent years these two committees have
acted as one body under the chairmanship of
the Superintendent of the Experimental Farm
at Nappan, with the Provincial Chemist from
Truro acting as secretary. This body has
appro-ached the Dominion Government for

519

financial assistance in order te repair damnage
te dykes and aboiteaux. During the war years
the Dominion Government teck the stand
that the renewing of dykes'and abeiteaux
should be a post-war prejeet which would
give employment te numbers of people who
would otherwise be unemployed. Therefore,
the most it thought it wise te do during the
war years was to contribute on an equal basis
with the province and the land owners to the
repair work necessary to keep the lande from
flooding. The policy of the federal geverfiment at the present time is te contribute onethird of the ceat, the other .two-thirds being
contributed equally by the province and the
land owners. On the passing cf this bill the
new regulations will become effective.
Hon. Mr. EULER: Wbat i8 the present
anual cost of repaira?
(Kings): It
Hon. Mr. McDONALD
amounts to about $200,000, to be dîvided
three ways.
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: What is the total
acreage affected?
Hon. Mr. McDONALD: About 70,000 acres
of land, already dyked, and I have intimated
that there might be another 20,000 acres which
could be reclairned. I should like to say that
not all of the land that has been dyked is
by any means out to sea. For instance, at
Grand Pré the dyke commissioners. and
owners keep their aboiteaux in repair, witb
the result that their land is faîrly productive.
In the Cumberland area there is a large block
cf land back of the town of Amherst which
today, because cf the dykes having gone out,
has beconie entirely non-productive. There
is a similar block at Wolfville, Nova Scotia,
where the dyke was allowed to go eut. I
have been told by engineers that these dykes
could have been saved by breakwaters. That
is the reason the bill makes reference -to
breakwaters. I believe that by proper drainage much valuable land now under cultivation
can be made more productive and that land
net new being tilled can be put under
cultivation.
Honourable senators will note that by section 3 cf the bill the minister has authority
te construct and te reconstruct dykes and
aboiteaux in this area.
Hon. Mr. LEGER: That act would net
apply te the sewers?
Hon. Mr. McDONALD: No. This refers
only te the dykes and aboiteaux in the Bay
cf Fundy area, which extends from the coun-

SENATE

ties of Albert and Westmorland in New
Brunswick through the counties of Cumberland, Colchester, Hants, Kings and Annapolis
in Nova Scotia.
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: Does it nlot also go
into Prince Edward Island?
Hon. Mr. McDONALD: There is a small
area in Prince Edward Island which, 1 understand, the engineers believe can be made
more productive if work is donc there as wcll
as in the provinces of Nova Scotia and New
Brunswick.
Hon. Mr. LEGER: It is not presumed,
then, to end in the drainage of the marsb.
There is no provision for construction of
sewers; the measure is oniy for the co nstruction of dykes and aboiteaux and breakwaters. It is only proposed to stop the water
from coming in; there is no provision to drain
the marsh?
Hon. Mir. KINLEY: That is a provincial
matter.
Hon. Mr. McDONALD: I arn corning to
that.
At the moment I arn dealing only
with the work wbicb it is proposed that the
fedieral govcrnment shall do. They wvill look
after the building of the dykes and the
aboiteaux to shut eut tidal waters frorn these
dykc-lands.
Hon. Mr. LEGER: They propose to deal
only with the high seas, so to speak.
Hon. Mr. McDON-\ALD: The tidal waters,
yes. It is proposcd to kecp out the water
frorn these dyke-lands.
It ia estirnated by -the federal minister that
this proposed expenditure will amount to
$3,210.000, the details of which, with the permission of the bouse, I wvill place on H1aisard:
30 miles ncew d5ýkes at $10»00 a mile
70 miles heavy rcinforcing dykes at
$6,000 a mile ..................
420.0ý00
200 miles nedium and ligbt reinforeing dykes at $2,500 a mile..
500,000

each.........................
80-0,000
2,0 large aboiteamix at $30,000 cadi..
600,00
35 medium size aboiteaux at $6,000ý
cach . . . . . . . . . . . . .
2.10,000
200 small aboiteamix at $1,00-0 each..
200 breakw aters at $700h eacli..
140 ,0,00
80,000 acres, suirvey~s and planis at 50)
cents per acre................
40,0130
Total........................

$3, 210,000

It is also proposed that the provinces should
look after the expenditures, estimatcd at
$4,230,000, te cover the ccst cf constructing,

straightening, digging or cleaning laterals, sublaterals and dale ditches. This eost is made
up as follows:
50 miles large canaIs at $10,000 a
5H0,000
Mile..........................$
130 miles large creeks at $5,00O a
mile.............. ...............
650,000

7,000 miles of dale ditches at $200, a
Miîle............................
1,4,00,00,0
Total ..........................

$1,230,0W0

The third div ision of expenditures proposed
is to be undertaken by the dykeland owners.
About 70,000 oi. 80.000 acres are to be replowed,
limed, fertilized and rc-sccded at 818 per acre,
or a total of $1,440.000. The combined total
of these three divisions of expenditure is
$8,880,000. As I recall, in 1945 1 had an estimate made of these expenditures, and I believe
it was considered by the advisory committce
of wbich 1 have spoken, and with whom, in the
capacitv of an advisory organization. thie minister propos.es to deal if tîmis bill becornes law.
That carlier estiniate amounted to only
e7,277,000, but iii was computed at a time when
wýages and costs wer not as bigh as they are
todfay. It is believed that. depending on how
mucb is accomplished each year, from five to
ten vears will be required te complete the
woik. Thie minister is reported to have expresse(l thie be t bat bis paît of the operation,
namely, the building of the dykes and the
aboiteaux, can be coipletcd in a inuch sborter
time. Th.at is w ork for wbich the Dominion
Government will assume the responsibility.
I should like to sec this bill go to the
Comrnittee on Natural Resources, wbcre the
Diiector of Experimental Farms. Dr. Arclîibald,
could be questioned in detail about this legislation. Dr. Arcbibald bas been very belpful over
the x'ears in the maintenance work that bas
bccn carried on by the dominion and the
prov incial governments, and I think tîmat we
would benefit greatly by being able to question
bim and get bis advice on tbis legislatîon. I
think we should ascertail. if possible, the
degree of co-operation wbich the provinces will
give iin the dredging and digging of larger
canals and ditches. I tbink tlîat the heavy
equipment wbich is now owned by the Dominion
Governmcnt, and other cquipmnent wbîcb it
will be necessary to purchase, would bave to be
used by the provincial governments in the
digging of these larger canaIs and ditcbes; and
it is to be hoped that the federal Department
of Public Works will co-operate with the provincial dcpartments in making this heavy
equipment available for provincial use.

JUNE 3, 1948
Hon. Mr. EULER: Is there any assurance
that the provinces will do their share as outlined in the honourable senator's remarks?

some very fine questions; but unfortunately
we did flot hear the questions, and certainly
we did not hear the answers.

Hon. Mr. HUGESSBN:
,done until they do.

Nothing can be

Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: In other words, we
cannot hear you. Speak louder.

Hon. Mr. EULER: No, but have they given
any assurance?

Hon. Mr. EULER: If I had put my questions wbile facing the leader of the -opposition,
the bonourable senator from Kings would not
have heard me.

'Hon-. Mr. McDO NALD: I would advise
the bonourable senator from Waterloo (Hon.
Mr. Euler) that the Dominion Government
have undertaken to do what the provinces of
New Brunswick and Nova Scotia have asked
them to do. The one exception relates to the
digging of the main ditches. The provinces
of 'New Brunswick and Nova Scotia asked the
Dominion Government if they would dredge
these larger ditches as well as look after the
building of dykes and the aboiteaux. That
is the only possible difference which may be
involved.
Hon. Mr. EULER: There is a third element
-the amount to be contributed by the owners.
Can tbey be compelled to pay their share?
Hon. Mr. McDONALD: I am glad the
honourable senator has raised that question.«
The only answer I make is that I think the
provinces whicb are entering into agreements
witb the dominion in this matter should have
uniformi marsh 'legislation; and that any owner
wbo was not interested enough to carry out his
Part of the bargain migbt well be required to
surrender ownership to somebody else. If the
owner of a dyke failed te, look after bis
property ho migbt endanger the property of
bis neighbours.
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: Could not the
owners be assessed and taxed, as is done in
connection with other public works?
Hon. Mr. McDONALD: That is the practice
at the present time, and wben the work is
done the bill is sent to the owner of the
property. I think the procedure might be
carried a stage further, to provide for forfeiture of the land wben the owner will not
pay bis bill or give proper attention to bis
land.
Hon. Mr. EU*LER: It would be for the
provinces to enact legislation of that kind.
Hon. Mr. McDONA'LD: Yes.
Hon. Mr~. HAIG: I have no doubt that the
honourable senator from Waterloo (Hon. Mr.
Euler) and the bonourable senator from Aima
(Hon. Mr. Hugessen) asked the honourable
senator from Kings (Hon. Mr. McDonald)

Hon. Mr. HAIG: If you had spoken loud
enougli I would have heard you.
Hon. Mr. EULER: You will see it ini
Honsard tomorrow.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I want it now. I want to
know what the bonourable senator from Kings
bas been saying.
Hon. Mr. McDONALD: I am sorry if I did
not speak loudly enougb.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I am in this difficulty,
that possibly I shahl have to vote against the
bill if I do not know about it. An expenditure
of $4,000,000 is proposed, and I cannot consent
to the expenditure of tbat amount of money
witbout knowing wbat it is for.
Hon. Mr. McDONALD: I should like to
remind honourable senators of tbe large
amount of western Canada feed that bas been
taken by tbe Maritimes sine 1941. From
October of tbat year to last April there have
been brought from tbe West to Nova Scotia,
1,012,228 tons, to New Brunswick 895,616 tons,
and to Prince Edward Island 291,453 tons.
I am sure you will ahl agree that tbis is a
large amount of feed to ho taken into the
Maritime Provinces from western Canada. It
points to the need of increasing the production
of feed grain in the Maritime Provinces. I
behieve that if this legislation is passed and
these most productive lands are put into a
good state of cultivation, we can increase the
amount of grain tbat we produce for livestock
feeds.
There is another point wbich I should like
to mention. I feeh-and I say tbis as a friend
of the dairy farmers-that the government, in
paying the freigbt on livestock feeds from the
bead of the lakes in recent years, bas been
fairly generous, and I want to take tbis opportunity of thanking the government andi the
Minister of Agriculture for extending this
policy for another year. I hope that it may
become permanent, because it is necessary,
especially for tbe farmers of the Maritime
Provinces. Also as a friend of the dairy farmr-

SENATE

ers, I sbould like to say that the Senate bas
been fairly generous to them, particularly in
the last threc years.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, bear.
Hon. Mr. McDONALD: I should think they
must realize that they cannot continue for a
long period of time to have their very valuable product in short supply without having
to meet the competition of a cheap suhstitute.
Hon. Mr. EULER: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. McDONALD: I realize that it is
flot as easy for thema to increase their production now as it was in the years before the
governiment gave subsidies for the production
of fresh milk, or butter fat, or for the manufacture of cheese to be sold to Great Britain.
I well remember, though, wben we did have a
surplus of hutter in Canada. I recaîl comiog
to Ottawa and asking the Minister of Agriculture if he would not take five to ten million
pouods of butter and send it to Britain, to
prevent our prices from. falling too low,. 1 did
not succeed, and the price went to 22 cents
a pound, much below cost of production, where
it remained for somne time. Dairy farmers in
their own interest sbould now make a determincd effort to increase their output, so that
there will not 'be a shortage.
Rigbt Hon. Mr. MACKENZIE: Wbat year
was that?
Hon. Mr. McDONALD: That was in the
1930's. 1 have flot the information here in my
records, 'but 1 can certainly get it for the right
honourable gentleman.
I arn sure other honourable senators would
like to be heard on this subject, and in closing
1 would again express the thankfulness which
I know the farmers feel that this legislation
bas heen brouglit before parliament. 1 amn
certain that 1 arn voiciog their sentiment when
I say they are very' gratefiil to the governiment,
to the federal Minîster of Agriculture and to
the ministers of agriculture of the three Maritimne Provinces. They have donc something
that the rest of us could not accomplish.
Hon. J. J. TURGEON: Honourable senators, I risc to say a few words on this bill, flot
becauise I was born in the Maritimes nor
becausc I now live in and represent part of
the flood-damaged province of British Columbia. I speak now because, as was so kindly
pointed out by the honourable senator fromn
Kings (Hon. Mr. McDonald), I had the
honour and privilege of heing chairman of the
House cf Commons Comrnjttee on Reconstrucetion, which dealt with the marshlands problemn
of the Maritime Provinces. I may say that the
right honourahiýe senator from Vancouver was

a vaiued member of that committee. Also,
sitting concurrently with that committee ws
a Senate committce presided over by the
honourable member fromn Ottawa (Hon. Mr.
Lambert). Whcn delegates appeared before
our committec the chairman of the Sexmate
committee acted as co-chairman with me.
The House of Commons committee sat fer
three years, and the honourable senator from
Kings, who was then Minister of Agriculture
for Nova Scotia, appeared before the coinmittee in April 1943 and prcsented the best
evidence the committee had ever received. It
referred generally to agricultural conditions in
the Maritime Provinces and specifically to the
marshlands problema of those provinces. Both
in and out of this chamber I have seen persons who wcre referred to in that evidence, and
who had worked consistently and bard in order
to help solve the marshlands problem. In June
of 1943, just two months after the honourable
senator from IKings appeared, the committee
made its report to the other bouse. Tbis report,
after rcferring to agricultural conditions, set out
the following recommendation:
Our studies bave convinced us, however, that
in many respects Caniada's agricultural
if e
would be greatly improved if the general provisions of the Prairie Farmn Iehabilitation Act
could be applied to ail of Canada. We, therefore, recommend that the government conisidýer
the advisability of smbmitting to parliament
legislation that will so amend the Prairie Farmi
Rehabilitation Act as to make its provisions
available thronghout Canada in the samne manner as tbey now apply to certain parts of the
three prairie provinces.
1 appreciate what tbe honourable senator
from Kings said about the committec, and
I appreciate the fact that the initial steps are
n-ow being taken towards carrying out one of
the recommendations contained in its report.
Honourable senators, just as the Maritime
Provinces have for many years occupicd an
unfavourable agricultural position because of
tidal waters ravagîing so much of their fertile
land, so in British Columbia today there arc
wide areas of land that without question are
goiog to requiire legisiative assistance under the
general
provisions of the Prairie Farm
Rehabilitation Act. There are threc large areas
of British Columbia in wbich damage amounting to many millions of dollars bas already
been donc one along the Canadian National
transcontinental line from McBride to Prince
Rupert, one in the agricultural and partly
industrial area of the Kootenays, of wbich
Trail is the induistrial cen.tre, and tbe third in
the great Fraser river valley-and I arn hoping
tbat before long parliament will be considering
a rcbabilitation act specifically covering tbe
damage in those arc as.

JUNE 3, 1948

Right Hon. Mr. MACKENZIE: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. TURGEON: 1 have already read
that part of oe of the reports of the House
-of Commons Committee on Reconstruction
-which. rp<commended extension of the Prairie
Farm 'Rehabilitation Act, and, I eall particular
attention to the words used:
We, therefore, recommend that the government consider the advisability of submitting to
parliament legisiation that will so amend the
Prairie Farma Rehahilitation Act as to make
its provisions available throughout Canada in
the same manner as they now apply to certain

parts of the three prairie provinces.
That was net the exact wording used in my
original draft of that section of the report as
submitted to the committee.
The draft
recommendation was that the act be made to
aipply te all agricultural portions of Canada.
However, some members of the committcc sugàgested that the act should net apply automatically, but that its provisions should be made
available throughout Canada, and the measure

before us now seeks te make those provisions
applicable to the rnarshlands of Nova Scotia,
New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island.
In closing I want to say a word in tribute
te the thirty-four members whýo with me constituted that Comrnittee on Reconstruction.
Ail parties were represented-Liberal, Conservative, C.C.F. and Social Credit-and one
inember was an Independent. We held sittings
in three censecutive ycars-sometimes when

pariliament *was not in session-and on ne single
occasion did the spirit -of party politics enter
into our deliberations.
Some honourable
senators listening te me now can bear me eut
in that.
I arn happy te think that we are far from the
end of an extension *of the provisions of the
Prairie Farsu Rehabilitation Act.

Hon. J. J. KINLEY: Henourable senaters, I
arn an enthusiastie supporter of this bill.

1

want that statement on the record, for the
people of the Maritime Provinces are intensely
interested in the reclamatien of these marshlands. It happens that in the part ef Nova
Scotia wherc I live the shores are high and
rugged and there is ne danger of invasion by
the sea, but other parts have for generatiens
been menaced by the tides trwice a dayor, strictly speaking, twicc in every twentyfour heurs and forty-nine or fifty minutes.
The *water dees net always rise te the same
height. It is net se high during neap tides,
for instance, as when the spring tides are at
their maximum. And tides often risc to high
levels in times of strong winds and during
the equinox. There are extremiely higli tides
in the Bay of Fundy: 'with every incaming

tide the occan, backed up by the American
ceast, rushes up the bay with great force, and
in seme places the difference between high and
lQw tîde is fifty feet. It is net intcnded to control such tides as that. The object of the
bill is largely to protcct fertile lands that arc
usually above water and are flooded only on
certain occasions, as during the spring tides
or cwhen there is a storm. These lands are te
be reclaimed for agricultural purposes.
This is a very important projeet for Nova
Scetia, because after ahl there is net tee much
tillable land in that province. The Dominion
Goverament will co-eperate with the governments of the Maritime Provinces in the building of dykes and aboiteaux. To be worth while
a dyke must be capable of proecting the land
against aIl eventualities. In each case the
development of the lands, as well as their
drainage by canais and other necessary means,
will have te be donc by the owners and the
provincial government concerned.
I cao, assure the house that in Nova Scotia
these lands wili be developcd and used for
the advancement of agriculture. As I look
back ever ýthe past it seemns te me that agricultural and industrial dievelopmcnt bas been
neglected in our province, whilc our people
have laid great stress uPen- suecess in what arc
called the learned or intellectual professions.
Many a-blc men have made their mark in
other parts of Canada and in the United
States, and while we de net wish to stop the
expert of brains we do hope te impreve local
conditions se. that there will be ample epportuinity for our people te succeed in agriculture, which is the basic industry, even in
Nova Scotia.
Thanks were expressed here this afternoon
te the Senate for its gcncrosity te the dairy
industry. Well, there arc two kinds of gencresity; one censists in making a gi-ft, and. the
other consists in net taking something away.
It was the second kind, in which the Senate
indulged, and while there is nothing wreng
wi.th that I must say it is a kind of gcneresity
that I uqed te consider net cspecially typical
of Liberals.
As was poin-ted eut this afternoon by the
honourable gentleman from Kings (Hon. .Mr.
McDonald) the first dykes in, Nova Scetia*werc buiît by the French,. Anyone who gees
threugh -that country must be impresscd by
the industry and vision of these peuple, who
when they came te this continent must have
applied the result of their experience in the
Loîw Countries of Europe. The French congregated in the, part of Nova Scetia where the
dyke-lands were available. The Acadians,
hefore their expulsien-that blet on the history of this country se colourfulhy portrayed

SENATE

in Longfellow's Evanqeline-evidently lived
an abundant and happy life until they were
forcibly transported from their homes in the
Land of Evangeline.
I do not. say that the people of Noýva Scotia
would develop the màrshlands sufficiently to
justify the passing of this bill. They are s0
ambitious and eagýer for advancement that it
is bard ýto keep tliem on .farms. *But we have
an immigration policy, and people brought.
bere from other countries may very well look
at these lands an'd regard themn as especially
good. We mu6t not think too lightly of our
immigration poliey. 1 am reminded that t'wo
hundred years ago my ancestors camne to
Nova Scotia from. Hanover and from the
British, Isies. Immigrants also came from
Scotland, and settled in Cape Breton and in
Pictou count.y.
From Yorkshire they came to Cumberland
and Colchester, two of the finest counties in
Nova Scotia. Then the United Empire Loyalists came and contributed mucli to the Maritime Provinces. And we must flot forget the
Frenchi. Tliey were liere first. There are
70.000 Acadian Frenchi in Nova Scotia today.
I was associated with tliem in publie life for
many years. In the provincial legisiature at
least five counties had Frenchi members. Tliey
were men of culture and refinement.
I think this bilhl represents a legitimate
endeavour to do something for the agriculture
interests of the Maritime Provinces. It is
also an honest attempt to control the invasion
of the sea on the east coast of Canada. It is
not in any way setting a precedent or doing
something for a partieular class. In supporting
the bill I wish to compliment the honourable
gentleman who moved second reading (Hon.
For years lie lias
Mr. McDonald, Kings).
been advocating sucli measures for the province
of Nova Scotia. H1e lives in the part of the
country directly affected by the problemn. I
am sure that everyone front that area will
agree that lie lias been a big factor in bringing
to a successful issue this fine effort at conservation of valuable lands.

Hon. Mr. PATERSON:

May I ask the

lionourable senator a question? The purpose
of this bill is, 1 believe, to create more feedstuifs so that the Maritime Provinces will be
independent of western Canada. Wliat will be
done for us wlien we have a surplus of barley
and oats? Will our Maritime friends help us

to get markets to tlie soutli?
Hon. Mr. KINLEY: I would flot put it
just that way, but I think the farmers in Nova
Scotia should raise more feed products. We
should be more independent in the matter of
supplying feed for our stock. I think the

farmers in western Canada will find tliat as.
we in the East go forward we will need more
of the produets they have. One part of the
country will not succeed and go forward without the other.

Hon. Mr. PATERSON: I know that my
honourable friend from Winnipeg (Hon. Mr.
llaig)ý did not follow that part of my friend'spropostion, or lie would have put the question
first.
Hon. F. W. GERSHAW: Honourable senators, this bilil is an extension of the Prairie
Farm Rebabilitation Act, and as sucli I amn
sure we will all support it. It provides for tlie
reclamation of some 70,000 acres of land.
In western Canada a haîf million acres of
land lias been reclaimed by irrigation, but
there still remain a further million and a, haîf
acres that can be reclaimed at a comparatively
low cost. There is one irrigation selieme by
whicb 200,000 acres can be watered at a total
cost of about $20 per acre. Irrigation would
lielp to increase the food supply so desperately
needed in the world today; it would make real
homes for a great many people to enjoy. I
do hope that in the development proposed in
the provinces down by the sea, the great need
for irrigation in western Canada wilýl not be
lost siglit of.
The motion was agreed to, and the bull was
read the serond time.
REFERRED TO COMMITTEE

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON moved that the
bull be referred to the Standing Committee on
Natural Resources.
The motion wae agreed to.
LAND TITLES BILL
SECOND READYING

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON moved second reading of Bill I-11, an Act to amend the Land
Titles Act.
H1e saidi: Hlonourable senators, I have asked
the lionourable senator from Toronto (Hon.
Mr. Hayden) to explain this bull.

Hon. SALTER A. IIAYDEN: Honourable
senators, this bill proposes certain amendments
to the Land Titles Act, which relates to the
titles of properties in the Northwest Territories
and the Yukon. The regîstry office for the
Northwest Territories is located in Ottawa, and
the one for the Yukon iýsin Dawson City.
The proposed amendments are of a technical
nature and arise from. the experience of the
western provinces in their administration of
the Land Titles Act. The bill contains about
eight proposed amendments, only one of which

JUNE 3, 1948
is of substantial importance. The amendments
have for their background and justification
similar provisions in the statutes of the western
provinces which have proved to be of practical value. The only new provision in the
bill is one which restricts the number of lots
that can be included in one certificate of titie.
This change bas become necessary for the
reason that wben an unlimited number of
lots were put on one certificate s0 many
entries were required that they became
undecipherable. It is now proposed to lirait the
number of lots that may appear on one certificate. The bill also proposes that when a
property is subi ect to mortgage or other
encumbrance, the duplicate certificate of titie
shall remain on file in the Land Tities office
and the mortgageee shall receive a certificate
of charge.
Though neither the Northwest Territories
nor the Yukon have municipalýities such as we
have, there is a provision requiri.ng that the
transfer of land sold for taxes be registered
within two years from the date of sale. That
is not an important amend'ment, but it does
make the practice uniform. The bill also
provides that where a woman holding property
subsequently marries and desires to have the
record of her marriage i.ncorporated into the
new certificate of title, some discretion is
vested in the registrar te decide what evidence
he requires in order to give that certificate of
transfer.
There are some new formos; and then 1
corne to the important provision concerning
caveats. Any person who wants to question
or to assert an interest in land or titie to land
can file a caveat. Under the present act that
caveat will lapse at the end of three months.
As I understand it, ithe practice in the western
provinces is different. The purpose of the
amendment is to bring this practice into line
with theirs. If this amendment is passed the
caveat will continue; it will nlot automatically
lapse at the end of three months unless proceedmngs have been taken and are going along.
Tbe person whose property is affected by the
caveat wîil have the .right to serve a notice
in the prescribed form, and ithe registrar can
then determine whether the caveat shaîl be
discharged or whether it shaîl be continued
for a further limited period of time.
These, in substance, are the amendments.
As I have said, they are not substantial nor,
wi'th one exception, are they very important;
but they have the effect of modernizing the
act and making it more uniform with the
practice in the western provinces.
Right Hon. Mr. MACKENZIE: May I be
permitted to congratulate my honourable

friend who has just spoken on his most lucid
explanation of this measure?
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: The honourable
senator from Toronto (Hon. Mr. Hayden>
might have explained the difference hetween
the old system, of registration and the Torrens
system, which is in force in the western provinces. We have found that it is a very fine
system indeed. Whenever a deal goes tbrough
and a change of title takes place, alI prier
proceedings affecting the land are cancelled
and the government guarantees the new title.
A man can go out of the land titles office
with the title in bis pocket, instead of having
to deal with a dozen deeds whicb may go
back forty or fifty years. It is a splendid
system, and it is too bad that it is not in
force throughout Canada. I believe it bas
been partially adopted in British Columbia.
Right Hlon. Mr. MACKENZIE: Yes.
And partially in
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN:
Ontario.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: I have noticed that
a number of British Columbia deals which
have passed through mny office in the West
are under this new system. of land registra,tion; but I do not remember any deals of
that nature relating to Ontario.
I also wish to thank the honourable member from Toronto for the very lucid manner
in which he has explained this bill. As he has
said, the amendments are not of great importance, but they improve the act and bring it
up to date; and that is exactly the kind of

MANITOBA NATURAL RESOURCES
BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. WISHART McL. ROBERTSON
moved the second readmng of Bill K-il, an Act
to amend The Manitoba Natural Resources
Act.
He said: Honourable senators, I have asked
the honourable senator from Churchill (Hon.
Mr. Crerar> to explain thîs bill.

SENATE

Hon. T. A. CRERAR: Honourable senators,
it will be within the memory of some members
of the bouse that in 1930 the natural -resources
of the province of Manitoba, which before
that date had been held by the Government
of Canada ini the right of the Crown, were
transferred to the province of Manitoba. This
wa.s effectedl by an agreement between the
Manitoba government, and the federal government. The agreement of course had to be
confirmned by legisiation at Westminster, since
an amendment of the British North America
Act was necessary, and this was done.
Section 2 of the transfer agreement provided
that the Manitoba government, would recognize and carry out ail the agreements made
prior to the transfer of the resources and
having to do with the sale of lands, timber
liccnsing, water-powcr developments, and the
like. Section 24 of the transfer agreement
provided that the two contracting parties could
vary the agreement by mutuaL arrangement;
and it is under this section 24 that we are
considering the present bill, which is intended
10 iiodify section 2 of the agreement, to which
I referred a moment ago. That section provided for a continuation of the existing rights
of parties who had in one way or another
acquired thema froma the federal government.
We come now to another circumstance which
lias made necessary thc amendment proposed
in this legislation. Du'ring the year 1947 the
Manitoba government appointed a commission which conductcd a very full survey into
the water powers of the province. This was
necessary because, in the opinion of those
competent, to judge, Manitoba was nearing a
point where it would be short of hydro-electric
power. One of the -recommendations made by
the comimissioner, who I might say was Dr.
Thomas Hogg, for several years chairman of
the Ontario Hydro-Electric Power Commission, was that there should be a consolidation
of ail hydro-electric power plants in Manitoba,
unader a single provincial authority which would
have conferred upon it exclusive responsibility
for development, and operation.
Before the transfer of the resources in 1930
certain licences for the development of power
on the Winnipeg river were given to the
Winnipeg Electric Company and 10 the City
of Winnipeg HydTo-Electric System.* Under
the powers granted in these licences the
Winnipeg Electric Company and the City of
Winnipeg Hydro-Electric System developed
substantiel amounts of power. If the recommendation of Dr. Hogg is to be carried out, it
wilýl be necessary to vary these arrangements
s0 that, the province may set up an authority
that would hiave exclusive responsibility, not

only for the devehopment of new sites but also
for the operation of existing power plants. It
is proposed, therefore, 10 amend the original
transfer agreement by amending section 2. 1
think the amendments are rather important.
As already stated, section 2 confirms the
rights of parties who had secured licences for
the development of electric power. It is now
proposed to amend this section by adding
several clauscs to it, with the resuit that the
rights enjoyed by the holders of the licences,
confirmed by section 2 of the transfer agreement, may be somewhat changed.
One of
the amendmnents provides for the taking over
I need not deal
of existing power plants.
witb paragraph (a), but I particularly wisb 10
draw to the attention of the bouse a point
which bas given me some concera. Paragraph
(b) of the proposed amendmcnts would ýread
as follows:
,Now Therefore Tbis Agreement Wituesseth
That:
1. I>aragraph two of the said Natural Resources Transfer Agreement is varied by adding
at the end thereof, the following words:
or except in so far as any legisiation
(b) ia legisiation providing for the taking,
acquisition snd purchase by agreement or coinpulsorily or otherw ise or by expropriation of
any indentures, agreements, licences,and so forth.
The point that, 1 think, requires some clarification is the one concerning power being
given to coml)ulsorily take over existing plants
such as the Winnipeg Hydro-Electric plant
or the City of Winnipeg electric plant.
.10

Hon. Mr. HOWDEN: Is the power given
the province?
Hon. Mr. CRERAR: Yes.

Hon. Mr. HOWDEN: Did il not ahready
hiave that?
Hon. Mr. CRERAR: No. Under section 2
of the transfer agreement, which is still in
operation, the province undertook to carry
out the existing agreements for the sale of
land, the licensing of water power and anything else outstanding when the transfer took
eff eet.
I understand the amendments proposed in the bill before us, are in the forma
which the province of Manitoba requested,
and that the Dominion Government bias tried
to meet the wishes expressed in the draft submitted by the province. I believe that is the
position. How far the parliament of Canada
should confer power on the province of Manitoba .10 compuhsorily take over a plant at any
arbitraiy value it might fix, is a matter that
I think wriuld require some consideration.

JIINE 3, 1948
I presume this could be dealt with when
the bill goes to committee, as I understand it
will, in accordance with the intention of the
honourable leader of the government in this
house. But quite frankly, I do flot like the
princile of granting extraordinary powers to
governments. If those words "or compulsorily or otherwise" had been Ieft out, the
provision would have been for the taking,
acquisition and purchase by agreement or by
expropriation, which is the ordinary way. I
think this is a very important detail of the
legisiation now before us. When the bill
goes before the appropriate committee of this
bouse, inquiry can be made as to the reason
why powers which appear to me ito be rather
extraordinary are being given to the province
of Manitoba.
There is no question in my mind as to the
value of the recommendation made by Dr.
Hogg; but in the carrying out of these recomniiendations due regard should always be had
for what is fair and reasonable in dealing
with third parties. I should flot for a moment
wish to be considered as making any suggestion that the province of Manitoba would
deal unfairly if these rather wide powers be
granted. However, that is flot the point. My
objection is on the principle of the legisiation.
I think there is too much of a tendency these
days to confer extraordinary powers on the
executive arma of goverfiment. Tbis has been
done to such an extent that the need for parliamentary and legisiative discussion bas at
times been more or less sidletracked, and that
is a practice that I do flot like.
Honourable seflators, I trust that I have
made reasonably clear what tbis bill proposes
to do.
Hon. Mr. HOWDEN: I may have been misinformed, but it was my impression that the
water power developments in Manitoba were
leased to the goverfiment of that province from
the Dominion Government, and were used preemrnently by such companies as the street
railway of the city of Winnipeg. I was of the
opinion that in ail those lease agreements there
was a provision that the Government of Manitoba, or the Crown, in whatever right it miglit
be, had the pawer to appropriate the developmente at such times as it saw fit?
Hon. Mr. CRER.AR: No. The particular
licences referred to here, which are held by the
Winnipeg Electrie Company and the City of
Winnipeg, were granted prior to the tranefer
of the resources. Under paragraph 2 of the
transfer agreement it 'was stipulated that the
rights which parties enjoyed under these
5853-35

licences should flot be disturbed. This amendment to the transfer agreement bas been introduced because of the need for additional
powers in organizing the power resources of
the province. I do flot objeet to this, but I
object on principle to giving the Government
of Manitoba the right to compulsorily come in
to the City of Winnipeg Hydro-Electrie System, for instance, or the Winnipeg Electric Com.pany, wbich is a private company,
and say "We are going to take your hydroelectric generating plant, and we are going to
pay you so much for it, and no recourse is
open to you." I do not for a moment think
the Government of Manitoba would do this;
but it should not under these agreements have
the power to do it.
-At any rate, that is my reading of this
measure. I may be wrong about it, and I
should like to have the point eleared up in
committee. Under section 2 of the original
agreement the province bas flot the power to
interfere with these licences. Lt is quite proper
that it should be given power to, expropriate, if
necessary, or to purchase iby agreement; but to
me it seeme doubtful that it should be enabled
to take over properties or other things on its
own terms.
Hon. Mr. COPP: Lt would be extraordinary
if the province were enabled to do that
without expropriation.
Hon. JOHýN T. HALG: Honourable senators, may I congratulate the honourable gentleman from Churchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar) upon
stating the situation just exactly as it is. I
should like to add a ferw words to, what hie bas
said, and then move the adjournment of
the debate.
I agree entirely witb my honourable friend's
view that the Government of Manitoba will
ct fairly. I know the memibers of that government; I sat in the legisiature with several
of them, and I have the utmost confidence in
them aIl.
In Winnipeg electrical energy is supplied by
the Winnipeg Electrie Company and the City
of Winnipeg Hydro-Electrie System. Let me
refer first to the company. Lt is a private concern , and so that there may be no misunderstanding L will say at once that I own five
shares of its stock. I have had it for about
forty years and it is now worth around $25 a
share. There are approximately a million
other shares, so my holding is relatively smaîl.
The company generates power at two sites on
the Winnipeg river, and it uses this power for
two purposes: for the operation of the Winnipeg street railway and for sale to industrial
and domestie consumers in the city and surrounding municipalities. Ln other words, the

SENATE

company is a twofold concern. If it were
taken over by agreement or expropriation
everything would have to be included and the
One difficulty
company's rights protected.
about this is that the electrical energy branch
of the company pays, whereas the transportation branch normally does not pay, although it
did show a profit during the war, when streetcar traffic was unusally heavy.
Next I want to mention the City of Winnipeg Hydro-Electric System. In my own house
I have used hydro power ever since the system
began operations, which I think was some
thirty-six years ago.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: In 1911.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: There is an interesting history behind the installation of the hydro
system in Winnipeg. Away back forty years
or so ago the charge for domestic lighting in
Winnipeg was 20 cents a kilowatt heur. Then
the city council applied to the provincial government for permission to build a power generating site on the Winnipeg river, and the
application was granted. In course of time a
plant was erected and power generated-but I
will skip the early record and come down to
the present. The rate for lighting current in
Winnipeg now is 3 cents a kilowatt hour; and
for the current used in industry and household
cooking it is 1 cent a kilowatt hour. There is
no cheaper electrical power, I suppose, anywhere in the world. I do not know what rates
are charged by 'the Winnipeg Electric Company, despite the fact that I own five of its
shares.
Hon. Mr. HOWDEN: The rates are about
the same as those of the hydro system.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: The rates of both are fixed
by the Public Utilities Board, which also specifies the reserves that must be set aside for
depreciation and various contingencies. Incidentally, I may say that there is very fine
co-operation between the company and the
hydro system, and in the last five years we
have had very little interruption in the power
service. If at any time there was a break in
the hydro line the company took over and
gave temporary service to the people affected
and the hydro system reciprocated whenever
there was a break in one of the company's
lines.
Millions of dollars have been spent by the
hydro-electrie system on its power-generating
sites, but after setting aside large reserves for
depreciation and other purposes it still shows a
very nice profit. Speaking without the book,
I think that the net amount transferred
back to the citizens last year was $1 million.

When the new development on Slave falls is
completed the net annual profit to the city
will probably run to $3 million.
That is a lot of money. If the system is
expropriated it will be difficult to convince the
rural members of the legislature-and they
number forty out of a total of fifty-five-that
the city rates should not be raised in order that
the rates in the rest of the province may be
lowered. The power sites are all on the east
side of the province, so current for the rural
sections has to be transmitted through
Winnipeg.
Hon. Mr. BURCHILL: Is there no power in
the rural sections at all?
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: There are some local
plants.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: There are some local coalburning plants, but the hydro developments
are in the east. I agree with Dr. Hogg's
recommendation that the generating of power
should all be done by one body; but there are
difficulties in the way. I would not blame
rural members of the legislature for wanting
cheaper power in their own districts. On the
other hand, the rights of the citizens of
Winnipeg must be protected. The increasing
profits of the hydro system have helped considerably to reduce municipal taxes there. I
am a senator fron Manitoba, net from Winnipeg, but I want to sec that the vested rights
of the citizens of Winnipeg are protected.
Down through the years the property of the
citizens has stood as security for the noncy
raised to build and develop the power sites
and to generate electrical energy.
In the early days very few people foresaw
the great development of electrical enterprises
that we have witnessed. Let me tell you a
little story to illustrate that. Sir William
Mackenzie, the first president of the Canadian
Northern Railway, was one of the original
shareholders of the Winnipeg Electrie Company. One day in 1903, he sent out an engineer
with instructions to locate on the Winnipeg
river a site where 5,000 horsepower could be
developed.
After some time the engineer
reported that the only suitable site that he
could find had a capacity of 25,000 horsepower.
Sir William told him to make a further search
and carry out his instructions or he would be
fired. In the end that site had to be used, as
none with a smaller capacity was available, and
long ago it was absorbed in subsequent
developments.
A great deal of electrical energy has been
developed on the Winnipeg river. It is notable
that the river rises in the Lake of the Woods
which is controlled by the international waterways agreement.
The flow of water from

JUNE 3, 1948
Minnesota inýto the Lake of -the Woods is
controlled, and there is a -constant flow into
the Winnipeg river. For twelve months in
the y4ear the flow is kept as nearly equal as it
is hurnanly possible to keep it. At this time
of year, when water is normally high, it is
held back by dams, and in the low-water
season of February and. March it is allowed
to flow in to supply the power sites. Th.is
arrangement is the resuit of many years of
negotiation bet.ween Manitoba, Ontario, the
Dominion Government and the Waterways
Commission of the United States. In this
respect the ýtwo power companies in Winnipeg
have done a good job. I do not recali what
party was in power in Ottawa when -the
arrangement was made, but it also did a good
job. Now we do not wish to lose this development without being paid a fair and reasonable
price for it.
I agree witb the honourable senator from
Churchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar) that we sbould
not allow the government to say ýthat it has
the right to take it anyway. If an agreement
is arrived at, or if the parties arbitrate,' that
is very well. I do not think that anyone
should he asked to go further tban that.
For instance, we say to labour and to capital
that they must arbitrate: we also say to the
dominion authorities that before they take
possession of a piece of property they must
arbitrate. When I ama sitting around a table
representing, for instance, the Winnipeg
EIectrie Company or the city of Winnipeg, .1
do not wish', to. be told, "If you do not agree
to this proposition we are going ýto take the
property anyway." Under those circumstances
I would flot be in a position to dieker. The
honourable memrber frora Churchill (Hon. Mr.
Crerar) properly points out that this bouse
should flot agree to granting such authority.
We are here as a safeguard against that kind
of thing.
Right Hon. *Mr. MACKENZ1E: May I
ask a question?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Yes.
Right Hon. Mr. MACKENZIE: Is this bill
similar to the legisiation whicb came before
the Senate recently frora Saskatchewan with
regard to pipe lines?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: There is a similarity, and
we are holding up that particular legisiation
because of the objection which I now raise.
We say that Alberta and Manitoba must be
satisfied before we can go ahead.
I conclusion, I arn asking for a delay in
the passing of this mieasure because I have
sent copies of the bill to the Mayor of
Winnipeg and to -the chairmen of the various
5853--35j

commnittees of council, and have asked if
tbey wish any representa-tion made. I arn not
trying to block the provincial government, but
I want te, do my duty as a sen-ator fromn
Manitoba. The people who developed. this
organization over the past twenty, tbirty or
forty years, neyer received a nickel frora iýt.
The aldermen of my city who put this tbing
through did so in the -face of a good deal of
opposition. The ratepayers felt that their
money was being squandered and that tbey
would neyer get any reven-ue back. It did
look that way in the early stages, and if the
property is to, be exproýpriated now, the
citizens who put ýtheir money and energy
into the development are entitled. to,
protection.
With the consent of the house I move the
adjournment of the debate.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Before the motion
is put, rnay I ask my honourable friend
whether there was any opposition raised by the
city of Winnipeg or the Winnipeg Electric
Company when the agreement was before the
legislature of Manitoba?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I know that the Winnipeg
newspapers did raise some question about it,
but I arn not in a position to answer my
friend's question.
The debate was adjourned.
BANKRUPTCY BILL

READING

POSTPONED

On the Order:
Second reading of Bill L,11, an Act respecting
Bankruptcy.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Honourable senators,' in asking that this item be allowed to
stand I should pcrhaps make a brief explanation. Honourable senators know that when a
bill as volumindus as this one is introduced at
this stage of the session the primary purpose
is to give it a wide distribution among interested parties. There is no intention of asking
parliament to consider the measure at this
time. I may say that copies of the bill in
French will not be available until next week.
It may not be necessary for me to ask the
house to, give second reading to the bill. The
only purpose in doing so would be to permit
a committee to study the measure and to
hear representations from interested parties.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: Is this the same bil
that came before the Senate two years ago,
or bas it been amended along. the lines suggested by the Committee on Banking and
Commerce at that time?

SENATE

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: It is the same bill,
but I presume that there are incorporated in it
many of the changes suggested by the committee. The bill, as I say, will be distributed as
widely as possible, and will be considered
next year.

The order stands.

-provisions made in regard to Newfoundland in
the general terms of the I.E.F.C. recommendations?
9. If so, what was the nature and character
and extent of such special provisions?
10. Was Canada concerned with such pro-visions, or with the supply of fats and oils for
Newfoundland?

Right Hon. Mr. MACKENZIE: My questions continue:
20. Is the government informed of the production of oleomargarine in various world countries? Will such figures be produced for the
information of this house? Will the government supply this house with the information
(a) the per capita butter production of
butter-producing countries;
(b) the per capita production of alternative
margarine substances in such countries.
2.1. Will the government inform the house of
the average cost of butter
(a) in Canada,
(b) in our world markets,
for the last twenty years?
22. Will the governmnent inform the house of
the comparative cost of butter (a) in Canada;
(b) in the U.S.A.; (c) in New Zealand; (d) in
Denmark, for the last three years?
23. Is the government informed of any individual corporation-of large or small magnitude
-fostering the idea of oleomargarine production
for Canada?
24. If so, who are they, and what representations have they made?
25. What was the production in Canada of
edible oils suitable for the manufacture of margarine in 1947 from
(a) domestically produced raw material,
(b) imported raw material?
26. What were the imports of edible oil into
Canada for 1947 and from what countries were
they imported? Give quantities and value?
27. What are the corresponding estimates for
1948 and 1949 of the figures asked for in questions 25 and 26?
28. Are there grounds for believing that margarine could not be produced as cheaply in this
country as it could be imported from abroad?
29. Is there any way in which Canada could
increase her combined supplies of cils and fats
from domestic and imported sources faster than
the world supply increases, so long as the world
supply is subject to international control and
Canada accepts its resulting international obligations?
The inquiry is duly signed, to be placed on
the Order Paper.

BUSINESS OF THE SENATE
RULES AND PROCEDURE-NOTICE OF MOTION

On the Orders of the Day.
Right Hon. Mr. MACKENZIE: Honourable senators, to make myself thoroughly
unpopular this evening, I presume that this is
the proper time for me to give notice of a
resolution.
I regret that rule 27 of this house precludes
any one of us from inserting a preamble to an
executive resolution. I shall abide by that
restriction and refrain from giving any preamble or reasons for the resolution which I
intend to submit for the consideration of this
honourable bouse. I intend, if I am here, to
move for the removal of rule 27; but without
referring to it further I shall proceed with the
terms of my resolution. I may say first that,
unfortunately for me, perhaps, but maybe fortunately for this house, I have to proceed
overseas within the next three days, and shall
not be availableHon. Mr. HAIG: I regret exceedingly that
I have to rise to a point of order; but my
honourable friend knows, or should know, that
under the rules of this house he is required to
give notice of a motion, and I demand that
the rules be enforced. I regret that I have to
take this stand, but I am not going to permit
this house to be made a bear garden.

Rigit Hon. Mr. MACKENZIE: I entirely
agree with my honourable friend. I am now
giving notice of the motion.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Sit down.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: If my right honourable friend will read the resolution which
he proposes to move at a later date, that will
close the incident.
Right Hon. Mr. MACKENZIE: I intend
to give the house as much time as it requires
to consider and discuss this resolution. I was
only expressing my personal regret to the
honourable leader opposite that I could not be
here to take part in the discussion. I am now
giving formal notice of my motion.
Hon. Mr. COPP: Well, give the notice.
Hon. Mr. EULER: Read it.
Right Hon. Mr. MACKENZIE: That, and
nothing else, is what I intend to do. I am not
going to say a word by way of debate, but,
having given oral notice of the motion in this
house nearly a week ago, I think I am entitled
to inform my honourable and gallant friend
the leader opposite of its contents. I trust
that, even if I am absent, my honourable and
genial friend will be among those who will
support it.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: What is the motion?
Read it.
Right Hon. Mr. MACKENZIE: I was going
to do that some time ago, but I was more or
less stopped in my course through the curiosity
of honourable gentlemen opposite. Now that
their curiosity has been in some degree satisfied, witi permission of the house I shall proceed. The motion is:
That, in the opinion of this house, a special
committee consisting of six honourable senators
from Ontario, six honourable senators from Quebec, six honourable senators from the Maritime
Provinces and six honourable senators from the
Western Provinces, to be selected by the
Speaker of the Senate, the leader of the government and the leader of the opposition in the
SenateTheir inclusion should make them feel more
kindly towards me.
-should be set up to examine and consider the
rules and regulations, the practice and procedure of this house, to examine and consider the
present allocation and distribution of senatorial
representation, to examine and consider the
many and various proposals which, from time
to time, have been made for the re-allocation
and more effective distribution of the functions
and responsibilities of this honourable bouse,
with definite and immediate action in the public
interest; that the said committee shall report to
this bouse its recommendations, if any, for the
revision of the rules and regulations, the practice and the procedure of this house, with a view

535

te the clarification and expedition of the transaction of its business; that the said committee
shall report to this louse its recommendations,
if any, as te whether and by what means the
basis of representation of the varions provinces
and regions of Canada should be modified or
varied in the interest of fair and just representation for all portions of Canada, having regard, net only te the growth and redistribution
of population which has taken place since the
present basis of representation was established,
but te the historie function of the Senate in
safeguarding the recognized rights and privileges
of territorial, racial and religious minorities,
and of the rights reserved te the provinces by
the British 'North America Act and, in particular, that the said committee shall in its
report give special consideration as te whether,
in view of the great increase in population of
the four western provinces, the present allocation of senatorial representation gives adequate
recognition te Western Canada; that the said
committee shall explore, consider and recommend te this lieuse what measures, if any, could
or should be taken by improved practice and
procedure, by revision of the rules and regulatiens of this louse, by legisliative enactment of
the Parliament of Canada, or by the initiation,
in accordance with accepted constitutional
usage, of steps for amendment of the British
North America Act, or, by a combination of any
or all of the foregoing proposed methods, net
only in the matters of initiating and advancing
legislation in the interests of the people of Canada, but always of protecting the rights of the
several provinces, regions and minorities whose
interests have been assigned as the special responsibility of this honourable bouse, and of
making greater and better use of the experience

5853-36

and abilities of the members of this louse in
devising, planning, organizing and supporting
measures which shall contribute te the welfare,
progress and happiness of the people of Canada.
I submit, that honourable senators, as a

Right Hon. Mr. MACKENZIE: -which
this house will determine either to support or
reject; and I would only repeat my personal
regret that I must be in places afar, and not
able to lend any counsel of mine-for what
it might be worth-to the committee which I
hope will be set up. I believe the people of
Canada are looking today to this honourable
louse for action of this kind.

DAIRY INDUSTRY ACT
PROPOSED REFERENCE TO SUPREME COURT

Hon. W. D. EULER moved:
That, in the opinion of this house, the government should, immediately after prorogation of
the present session of parliament, refer to the

Right Hon. IAN MACKENZIE: Honourable senators, I rise to a point of order with
respect to the motion standing in the name of
the honourable senator from Waterloo (Hon.
Mr. Euler).
My first objection is that a question already
disposed of by a vote of the bouse is not subsequently debatable during the same session.
My second point is that Section 53 of the
British North America Act provides that:
Bills for appropriating any part of the publie
revenue, or for imposing any tax or impost,
shall originate in the House of Commons.
I draw the attention of honourable senators
to item 1204 of the customs tariff, which reads
as follows:
Oleomargarine, butterine or other similar substitutes for butter, and process butter or renovated butter.
This cornes under the pvohibited list under
the tariff and has to do with the fiscal structurc of Canada. I suggest that any resolution
affecting the fiscal structure of Canada cannt
originate in this honourable bouse. Therefore,
with all respect and deference to my honourable friend, I submit that on at least three
counts his .resolution is not in order.
Hon. Mr. EULER: Mr. Speaker, on a point
of 'order I wish to point out that, while I do
not profess to be as expert in parliamentary
procedure as perhaps my right honourable
friend is-

The Hon. the SPEAKER: May I interrupt
the honourable gentleman?
The right honourable gentleman from Vancouver Centre has raised the question of the
advisability of proceeding with this motion. I
have given very careful consideration te the
point at issue. It is true that already this session we have bad a debate on a subject-matter
that could come within this resolution, and
the motion giving rise to that debate was negatived. I think, however, the present resolution is quite ýin order and can be proceeded
with. I would ask the movor (Hon. Mr. Euler)
to confine his remarks closely to the resolution.
Right Hon. Mr. MACKENZIE: That is
quite satisfactory.
Hon. Mr. EULER: Honourable senators, I
may say that when speaking I always try to
confine myself to the motion before the house,
and I have nfot the slightest intention of transgress.ing the rules on this occasion.

JUNE 9, 1948

At the outset I wish to make it clear that
it is not my purpose to discuss the merits or
demerits ýof oleomargarine, although I should
like to remark, if this is in order, that the
defeat of the so-called margarine bill was
keenly disappointing to a great m'ajority of the
consumers of this country.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: That statement is -out of
order, but go on.
Hon. Mr. EULER: I also wish to say that
although the rcsolu -ion more or less involves a
constitutional question, I do not intend to cite
technical instances in support of the resolution.
I am not a lawyer and I leave that branch
of the argument to members who belong
to the legal profession. However, in the last
few years, since the oleomargarine issue has
become a rather urgent one in this country,
eminent lawyers, both in and out of this
chamber, have told me that in their opinion
the clause in the Dairy Industry Act
prohibiting the manufacture and sale of
margarine is ultra vires of this parliament.
The legislation may have been valid back
in 1886, when it was first enacted, as there
was then some question about the wholesomeness of oleomargarine as a food.
Hon. Mr. HORNER: I rise to a point of
order. Surely my honourable friend is not
merely reading the resolution. The oleomargarine debate will be thrown wide open again.
Hon. Mr. EULER: What is my honourable
friend's objection?
Hon. Mr. HORNER: I am objecting because you are making a speech, and I understood his Honour the Speaker to say that
you would be confined to reading the resolution.
Hon. -Mr. EULER: Not at all; and I would
rather appreciate it if I were not interrupted
unnecessarily.
I was saying that the legislation may have
been valid sixty-two years ago when the question of public health was involved. As the late
Senator Bench pointed out, in the preamble of
the legislation at that time there was a statement to the effect-I am not using the exact
words-that oleomargarine m.ight be detrimental to health. Shortly afterwards that statement was stricken out, and for a good many
years it has not been contended that the law
was necessary because of the unwholesomeness
of oleomargarine. Therefore it is felt that the
federal parliament no longer has power to
maintain thé legislation.
Further, this prohibitory law with respect
to the manufacture and sale of this commodity
is an invasion of the jurisdiction of the
provinces with respect to property and civil

zights.
5853-36J

537

Every lawyer that I have consulted is of
the view I have expressed. For that reason
I believe it is entirely in order to refer the
question to the Supreme Court of Canada, so
that we may have definite decision with regard
to it. I stated in a speech some time ago that
I had suggested to the Minister of Justice the
desirability of referring this matter to the
Supreme Court of Canada. I did that as a
private member of this house. The suggestion
did not meet with approval, but if the Senate
as a body makes a similar request, surely the
government will accede te it, and when the
Supreme Court renders its decision the reason
for bringing in a fourth Dairy Industry bill at
the next session may have disappeared. I am
quite confident that that will be the effect of
the decision.
Hon. JAMES MURDOCK: Honourable
senators, may I be permitted to say a word
on this question? Early in 1919, the government of the day put into effect a law creating
the Board of Commerce of Canada. In the
later part of that year, and early in the following year, the board held hearings in various
cities and other parts of Canada concerning
milk, butter, sugar, paper and other things.
Early in 1920 the paper makers of Canada
undertook te question the authority of a
federal law that would permit the Board of
Commerce of Canada to deal with newsprint
paper. They carried the matter to the Supreme
Court of Canada, and I think it was on the
first day of June, 1920 that the court decided
that the Board of Commerce had no jurisdiction over the production and manufacture
of newsprint paper, and that this matter came
within the prerogatives of the provincial governments as it concerned property and civil
rights.
If that decision of the Supreme Court on
June 1, 1920 was right, the court-although it
has changed materially since those daysmight take the same position with respect to
the much-discussed question which has been
before us for the past three years. I think we
ought to consider that when deciding whether
or not the Supreme Court of Canada should be
given an opportunity to go into the question
and render its decision.
Hon. Mr. HOWARD: I move the adjournment of the debate.
Some Hon. SENATORS: No, no.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON:
I assure honourable senators that I had no idea how long
the debate might be, and I asked the Whip
to adjourn the debate in order that I might
say something about this motion. It is not
my intention to unduly delay the motion, and

SENATE
while I ar n ot prepared to go ahead today,
I will give an undertaking to do so tom*orrow.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Very well.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Let it be undersrood that I suggest this course only because
I arn not in a position to say anything today.
If any honourable senator wishes to continue
the discussion at this time, hie may do so, and
then the Whip could adjourn the debate.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: I would prefer to
speak to the motion tomorrow.
The debate was adjourned.
MANITOBA NATUlIAL RESOURCES
BILL
SECOND READING

The Senate resumed from Thursday, June
3, the adjourned debate on the motion of Hýon.
Mr. Robertson for the second reading of Bill
K-il, an Act to amend the Manitoba Natural
Resources Act.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Honourable members, the
house kindly agreed to allow me to adjoura
this debate until today, and I shall not ask
for a further adjournment because 1 believe
the leader of the house (Hon. Mr. Robertson)
would like to have the bill before a comnmittee tomorrow.
I wrote to, the Winnipeg city council hast
'week, and have since been awaiting a reply.
F'ormerly a letter maihed at the samne time of
the week as mine was would have arrivcd on
Saturday morning, but because of daylight
saving, and the non-distribution of mail on
Saturday afternoons, my communication would
not have reached its destination until Saturday afternoon. Monday being a holiday, the
city council would not be able to deal with it
until yesterday, so I cannot get a reply until
tomorrow. However, I amn willing that the
bill go forthwith to committee, although I
should advise the leader of the house that if
by ýtomorrow I have not beard from the
Winnipeg city council I shaîl ask the comnmittee to adjourn its discussion until next
week. The matter invohved is of tremendous
importance to our city.
It might be helpful for me to say at this
time that the only amendment I desire is the
dehetion from the sebeduhe of the words, on
page 3, "or compulsorily or otberwise". Paragraph (b) would then read: "is legislation provîding for the taking, acquisition and purchase
by agreement or by expropriation of any
indentures. agreements," and se forth. My
purpose in suggesting that the compuhsory
feature be struck out is to ensure that action

shahl be taken only by agreement or by
expropriation, the latter being by proceedings
in arbitration. As a matter of fact, that is ahI
the power which the Dominion Government
has. If At wants a piece of propcrty it can
obtain it by agreement, or, failing agreement,
it can expropriate and have the Exehequer
Court determine the value. There are cases
of this sort every day. I do not think the
province should have any greater power in
this regard than the dominion, or, indeed, than
a railroad, which is empowered, when necessary for the purposes of acquiring land on
which to run a line of railway, to expropriate
the land and have the value determined by
arbitration.
As I say, under the circumstances I arn
willing that the bill go to committee; but
unless I hear from Winnipeg tomorrow I
shail a.sk the committee to adjourn the matter
until next week.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the second time.

Hon. Mr. GOUIN moved concurrence in
the amendments.
H1e said: Honourable senators, in the otber
place the naine of this insurance company was
changed, and now the title of the bill is "An
Act te incorporate The National Fire and
Casualty Insurance Company." It is purely
a 'matter of form, involving exactly three
changes. The tithe will be altered, as I have
just stated. A similar ýchange is necessary
where the namne appears in line 13 of the
English text, which will read "The National
Fire and Casuahty Insurance Company," and
in the fohlowing line, in the French text, whîch
wihl read "La compagnie Nationale D'Assurance Incendie et Risques Divers." I do flot
think there can be any objections to the
amendments. The premoters are perfecthy
'willing to accept the bill with this modification.
The motion was agreed to.

JUNE 9, 1948
EXCISE BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON moved the second
reading of Bill 228, and Act to amend the
Excise Act, 1934.
He said: Honourable senators, I have asked
the honourable senator from Toronto (Hon.
Mr. Hayden) te explain this bill.
Hon. SALTER A. HAYDEN: Honourable
senators, this bill proposes certain amendments to the Excise Act. In the budget resolutions the on.ly reference made to the Act
was with respect to the repeal, effective as of
May 19, 1948, of the excise duty on spirits
used in the production of vinegar. It appears
from the bill as it comes to us from the other
place that the opportunity has been seized
upon to provide for other amendments, some
of them for the purpose of lightening and
shifting the incidence of taxation, and others
purely for clarification. May I take a minute
or two to tel. you what they are?
It wil.1 be n.ecessary, I think, that the bill go
to committee because, while the budget resolutions proposed that the effective date for
the repeal of the duty on spirits used solely
in the production of vinegar should be May
19 of this year, when it came to the incorporation of that provision, in the bill it was provided by section 34 that the Act as a whole
should come into force on -October 1, 1948.
Actually, -the government has not been
collecting duties since May 19. Therefore, in order to validate what was
intended and what has been the practice followed by the department since the budget
resolutions were introduced in the other place,
some amendment will be necessary to make
the date of May 19 effective with respect te
spirits used in the production of vinegar.
Originally the excise duty was placed on
spirits used in the manufacture of vinegar i
order te encourage the manufacture of cider
vinegar in the Maritime Provinces. It is my
understanding that that proj ect did not turn out
satisfactorily, and was abandoned. There is no
longer, therefore, the same necessity for this
duty. That is one reason why it has been
repealed. Another reason is that the fishermen who used this spirit vinegar in pickling
fish, etc., found that by importing the vinegar
from the United States and paying the duty
on it they could claim a drawback when they
exported the cured fish, and in that way could
get their spirit vinegar more cheaply than
they could get it in Canada.
Another thing this bill does is to repeal the
duty on malt syrup. There are a number of
sections dealing with that repeal. First, there
is a direct repeal. This necessitates an amend-

539

ment te the particular schedule concerned, as
well as the deletion of certain sections in the
Excise Act itself wherein reference te malt
syrup occurs. There is a shifting of the
incidence of taxation on malt. As the Excise
Act stands at the present time, the maltster is
responsible for the excise duty. It is proposed
under these amendments te transfer the
incidence of taxation te the brewer. That will
mean that all malt received in a brewery will
be taxed. This does not cause any change in
the amount of revenue received from that
source, which in the year 1947-48 amounted te
$53 million. It will lower the cost of administration of the Act, because henceforth the
government will not be concerned with the
operation of the maltster but only with that
of the brewer. The brewer will have to account
for all the malt he receives, and he will have
te claim a refund or remission when he is
entitled te it under the Act. I understand that
the saving in the cost of administration resulting from this change will amount te at least
$100,000 per year.
I have outlined the main purposes of the
bill. There are a number of sections dealing
with the accomplishment of these purposes.
The measure repeals certain parts of the
Excise Act which deal specifically with malting and malt bouses and with certain schedules
by which the tax is defined. In addition there
are certain miscellaneous amendments covering a wide range of subjects. For instance,
the bill starts off with the very essence of
simplicity-the changing of the title of Commissioner of Customs and Excise te that of
Deputy Minister of National Revenue for
Customs and Excise, wherever it appears in
the Act. Then, where certain duties formerly
were fastened upon the Commissioner, they
now become the duties of the Deputy
Minister.
Certain penal sections of this legislation
have been revised in order te clarify the nature
of offences and the penalties te be imposed,
but the quantum of the fines or the terms of

imprisonment that may be meted out have
not been changed.
Next there is a measure of amelioration
with respect te the sale of spirits te druggists
by distillers. Under the law druggists may
purchase only five standard gallons at a time.
The difficulty has been that the smallest
quantity which a distiller could release from a
bonded warehouse was the minimum quantity
on which duty was payable. This quantity
exceeded the five gallons allowed te druggists.
The result was that both the department and
the distiller were obliged te keep watch on the
amount remaining until such time as it was

SENATE

taken by the druggists.
The amendment
enables payment of duty to be made on the
five standard gallons.
Then there is a section dealing with the
importation of manufactured cigars
and
tobacco, including cigarettes and snuff. The
practice has been to wrap these products,
whether domestic or imported, in cellophane.
But there is an obligation to put an excise
stamp on such products. The stamps have
been put on the domestic products, but the
problem in connection with imported articles
bas been to remove the cellophane and put the
stamp on.
This resulted in deterioration,
which was the very thing the cellophane was
put on to guard against. The practice is now
to be simplified, so that the manufacturer
abroad may first affix the stamp to his product,
then put on the cellophane wrapper, and finally
export his product to Canada. A number of
amendments are simply for the purpose of
tidying up matters of administration and the
collection of duties under the Act.
The motion was agreed to, and the bili was
read the second time.
REFERRED TO COMMITTEE

Hon. Mr. HAYDEN moved that the bill be
referred to the Standing Committee on
Finance.
The motion was agreed to.
JUDGES BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON moved the second
reading of Bill 329, an Act to amend the
Judges Act, 1946.
He said: Honourable senators, I have asked
the honourable senator from Queen's-Lunenburg (Hon. Mr. Kinley) to explain this bill.
Hon. J. J. KINLEY: Honourable senators,
this is a very brief bill. It strikes out the
additional allowance for a divorce court judge
in Nova Seotia. All the judges of the Supreme
Court of Nova Scotia are now being given
1ivorce jurisdiction, so it is not appropriate
that any one of them should receive addiional remuneration for divorce work. The
bill has the approval of the Government of
Nova Scotia.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the second time.
THIRD READING

The Hon. the SPEAKER: When shall this
bill be read the third time?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Now.

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: With consent of
the Senate, I move that the bill be read the
third time now.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the third time, and passed.
INCOME WAR TAX BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON moved the second
reading of Bill 330, an Act to amend the

He said: Honourable senators, I have asked

(Hon. Mr. Hugessen) to explain this bill.
Hon. A. K. HUGESSEN:
Honourable
senators, the principal object of this bill is to
implement the budget resolutions by changing
the Income War Tax Act as proposed by the
Minister of Finance in his budget speech. The
bill contains a number of clauses dealing with
minor matters, that being usual in legislation
of this kind, as will have been observed in
the bill explained a few moments ago by my
honourable friend from Toronto (Hon. Mr.
Hayden). They have to do with the clarification of certain provisions of the Act or the
rectification of errors. With those clauses I
do not intend to deal, for if the bill receives
second reading and is in the ordinary course
referred to committee, they can be considered
in detail then. I shall confine myself to the
major changes which were introduced in the
budget speech and are incorporated in the bill.
They are six in number, and I shall deal with
them by referring to the relevant sections of
the bill.
The first change will be found in subsection
1 of section 2, which provides for an increase
of $500 in the income tax exemption of persons of the age of 65 years or over. That
amendment bas I think met with universal
approbation, and perhaps the only additional
thing I need say about it is that it is estimated
that it will cost the revenue in the neighbourhood of $5 million a year.
The second change of importance will be
found in section 3, and it also is a relief to
certain taxpayers. It amends section 6 of the
Act by adding to it subsections (6) and (7),
which permit deduction from income by certain classes of employees who pay their
expenses while away from home in the course
of their employment. Subsection (6) deals
with transportation companies' employees
whose duties require them to travel away
from headquarters. They would be railway
employees and trainmen, inter-city truck and
bus drivers, automobile delivery men, and men

JtJNE 9, 1948
engaged on ferries who go overnight across
various straits. Subsection (7) relates to, persons cmployed to seli property or negotiate
contracts--in other words, ordinary commercial travellers. They are entitled to deduct
expenses paid by themselves under certain
conditions. First of ail, the contract of employment must provide that the employee
pays the expenses himself; secondly, he must
be regularly employed away from his employer's place of business; and thirdly, he
must he paid either in whole or in part by
commissions.
The third major amendment will be found
in sections 8 and 10. These deal with an
increase in the rate of interest payable on
overdue taxes. At the present time interest
on overdue taxes is payable at the rate of 4
per cent per annum. until there lias been an
assessment, and after that at au additional rate
of 3 per cent per annum, or 7 per cent in all.
The proposed amendments would increase the
rate of interest payable 'before assessment from
4 to 6 per cent per annum, and after assessment from 7 to 8 per cent per annum. A
rather interesting reason for this amendment
was given by the minister in another place.
H1e stated that it had 'been discovered that a
substantial number of citizens were deliberately underpaying their taxes when due, and
thus, in effeet, were borrowing money from. the
government at 4 per cent per annum.
The amendment in section 9 is the obverse
side of the picture. That section introduces
into this country an entirely new principle.
For the first time our government recognizes
that it has an obligation to pay interest to taxpayers on overpaid taxes.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: At 8 per cent?
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: I arn coming: to
that. My honourable friend is too optimistic,
1 am afraid.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: I knew there would
be nothing like that.
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: The proposed rate
of interest payable by the goverfiment bears a
reasonable relation to 8 per cent. It is 2 per
cent per annum on overpaymnents up to $5,000,
and one-haif of one per cent on payments in
cxcess of $5,000. Honourable senators will see
at once the reason for decreasing the rate on
large overpayments. It is conceivable that
some persons with big cash surpluses miglit
well be willing to make substantial. overpayments if they were going to get înterest
thereon at 2 per cent per annum.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: I never heard of
anyone having any money left after paying bis
income tax.

Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: There is a historical basis for that provision. For many years
the United States government paid interest on
overpaid taxes at the rate of 5 per cent per
annum. I understand that it was a common
practice among rich individuals and corporations to overpay their taxes to a substantial
amaount so as to obtain a perfectly safe 5 per
cent government investment.
With the
modest rates of interest provided by this
measure-2 per cent per annum on overpayments up to $5,000, and one-haîf of one per
cent on overpayments in excess of $5,000-I do
flot think there is much danger of such a practice in Canada.
The fifth amendment wîll be ýfound in sec-'
tions 12 and 15 of the bill, which in effcct
abolish the Income Tax Advisory Board provided for in the legisîntion of 1946. Honourable senators will recaîl that in that year,
provision was made for two separate boards,
namely, the Income Tax Advisory Board, which
I am now discussing, and the Income Tax
Appeal Board, which is being continued in
existence. The Income Tax Advisory Board
was set up for the purpose of advising the
minister in the exercise of the numerous ds
cretionary powers conferred upon him by the
Act as it now stands. Honourable senators are
aware that the new Income Tax Act introduced
in the other house yesterday, and referred to
the Banking and Commerce Committee, of that
house, does away with the vast mai ority, of
those discretions. That bcing so it was considered that the raison d'ctre for the Income
Tax Advisory Board had ceased to exist, and
therefore this legislation provides for repeal. .I
should perhaps add that the board, as its name
implies, was merely an advisory board and had
no executive power.e
The sixth and last amcndment, embodied in
section 16 of the bill, continues for 1949, as
contemplated in the budget resolutions, the
special allowances for depletion and development given during 1948 to cil, naturàIý gai
and minîng companies.
Those, honourable senators, are the princ'ipal
changes brouglit into effect by the bill. 1
think the measure is of sufficient importaânce
and interest to honourable senators to wararnt
its reference to a committee. I would suggest
that after second reading it be referred to the
Standing Committee on Banking and Commerce.
Hon. S. A. HAYDEN: Honourable senators,
there are one or two points I wish to raise in
connection with the propcsed amendments.
First, the present interest penalty cf 4 per
cent before assessment and 7 per cent afterwards and until the date of payment seema to

SENATE

me, baving regard to the present interest rates,

to be in the top brackets. The government
lias i.n its bands the power to shorten the period
between the time when a man is obliged to pay
bis tax and the date of assessment-during

wbicli tbe 4 per cent applies--by expediting the
assessment. This could quickly get a man into
a position wbere the higher rate would apply
upon bis liabiity as determined by the
assessment. Having regard to the present rates
of interest and ail tbe other factors whicli
enter into the day to day life of the people, 1
tbink the payment of 6 per cent interest
before assessment, on top of the income tax,
is a severe penalty to exact. We sbould not
]ose entirely our sense of proportion as to what
is reasonable by endeavouring to apply an 8
per cent levy following assessment.
A few years ago a special committee of the
Senate studied the income tax question over
an extended period, and some of its recommendations were incorporated in the amendments to the Act at that time. It recommended
the establishment of an advisory committee
and the granting of the riglit of appeal. These
recommendations were made because it was
frît tbat there should be some place wbere
tlie many discretions by the minister could be
reviewed. H1e was not bound in any way
to accept the advice of the advisory board,
but it was a furtlier committee of review.
There are stili many discretions in the
Income Tax Act which we will bave at least
until the end of this year, and the imposition
and assessment of taxation under that Act
will carry on for some time. So long as tbe
discretions continue, 1 sec no reason wby certain amendments whicb were tbought necessary
and advisable two years ago sbould not continue until the Act expires.
Hon. JOHN T. HAIG: ilonourable mcmbers, I think the bonourable member for
Toronto (Hon. Mr. Hayden) has covered
the question of interest rates very well. 1 may
say that I arn old enougli to remember bow
critical certain people were of 8 per cent
interest on mortgages. I neyer thouglit I
would live to see the day when a government
would tax the poor delinquent income tax
payers to that extent.
In my next few remarks I shahl try not to
transgress tlie rules, but I shaîl be very close
to the line. May 19, 1948 will go down as
black Tuesday for the two old political parties
in this country. If one wants to k-now tbe
reason for certain recent election resuits, lie
only bas to look at the reaction to the budget
from whicb these resolutions flow. It is flot
only a question of the payment of an 8 per
cent penalty, but of exemptions on income tax.

Hon. Mr. PATERSON:

And the rejection

Hon. Mr. HAIG: I tliought my honourable
friend did flot know the difference between
margarine and butter; otherwise he would not
have broken, the law by bringing margarine
across from the United States.
Some. Hon. SENATORS: -Oh, oh!
Hon. Mr. HAIG: The problem is this:
young men and young women who ten years
ago were earning $750 a year are *now making
at least $1,000 a year, but that 51,000 does
not purchase as much today as the $750 did;
yet tbey have to pay income tax on the
difference of $250. As a senator I arn ashamed
that our country does not recognize the plight
of this class of people. I arn thinking of a littie
town which I visit at times. and where, when
1 go out on Wednesday mornings, I take the
back streets. It is no use to say that the
Act will be amended next year, just before
election time. That will lie ton late.
Also the exemption of $1.500 or $2,000 for
married perszons is unfair. Those of us wbo
have incomes in excess of that amount must
recognize that people in the lower-income
classes have to be protected. If you. do nlot do
this vou wiIl play into the hands of those who
wouild like to make 'Canada a dictatorial state.
In my city there are plenty of people of this
T
mind. W e find thern in the (ity council. on
the sebool hoard. and in thSe legislature_ Tbey
sav: "This is a fieie country you live in; they
t'lx you te, death." Whether or flot the big
fellows are paying a good stiff tax, the question
is: Whbat about the little fellows who are just
getting by? This act does not give them exemption, and it should.
That is t.he fundamental point. We men and
women in the Senate must recogýnize that we
cannot compete witb the pbilosopby of
Russia unless we give our people in the lowerincome brackets a fair deal. We know that
th:is year the government has a big surplus,
amounting to, six or seven hundred million
dollars, nlot to speak of the ded-uction from
real surplus of the money from which-quite
properly, I admit-bas been given or loaned
to other countries, but wbieb nevertbeless
represents a profit.
May 1 point out that there are twenty-five
members of this chamber who do not get any
exemption under this bill, aithougli they are
pretty close to qualifying for it. The sixty
other members receive the speciaýl exemption;
and when you walk down the streets of my
city, they point at you and say: "There îs a
fellow who gets $500 of extra exemption: why

JUNE 9, 1948
don't we get it?" When I walked into *my
office the morning after this bill was passed
in the other place, the young men and women
there looked, at meHon. Mr. COPP: You are getting too old.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: -I saw them smiling,
and I knew what they were smiling aboutand the head girl said to -me: "How do you
get away with it, senator?"
Hon. Mr. HOWARD: Would you nlot rather
be in the other bracket?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Oh, I don't know. I arn
having a pretty good time as it is. If other
senators around sixty-five have as much fun
in the next ten years as I have had in the
last -ten years they are going to have a mighty
good time.
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: Do you nlot think
that the provision benefits those who are on
superannuation?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: To some extent.' But
people of sîxty-five have no children at home
to take care of; ýthey do not have to provide
for their education; tbey do nlot spend as
rnuch money going to parties at nigbts.
An bion. SENATOR: Is that so?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Yet people in that position are given the benefits of this bill. Persons on superannuation get an exemption of
$1,500 if they are married; and if I bad my
way tbey would get 82,000. A single person's
exemption is raised to $1,250, provided hie is
over sixty-five years of age. The people most
in need of exemption are those who are just
starting out in life and trying to get going,
and under our present burden of taxation it
is impossible for tbem. to save a competence.
It is the young people of our country who wili
make private enterprise a success, but under
the present system, so far as I ean see, the
young man or woman who is just rnarried,
and looking forward to thirty or forty years
of active work, cannot hope to save more than
a triffing amount.
I arn not criticizing the goverfiment. I do
not think the officiai opposition in the other
bouse were baif bard enougb on this bill. They
shouid have gone right to bat and said: "We
will fight this bill for weeks unless you increase
the exemption to 81,000 for single persons and
82,000 for married people, irrespective of age.Y
That is what ought to be done. In effect that
is the challenge which the C.C.P. are rnaking,
and it explains why they are winning elections.

Hon. Mr. HAIG: -ought to give thoughtfui consideration to the position of young
people in this country, and see to it that they
are given the opportunity they need.
I was pieased to hear that this bill is to
go to cornmittee. One point whîch arises in
rny mind is related not to the contents of the
bill but te announcements in the press. Manitoba bas suffered this year frorn bad floods
in the Red River valley, in the valley of the
Assiniboine, and in the Carrot river or Saska-tchewan valley. A great rnany of our
farmers have been very seriously affected.
According to the decision of the income tax
authorities, repairs to fences and farm buildings are to be allowed as deductions by way
of expenses, but this decision does not apply
to bouses. Wben the bill is in cornmittee we
should ask the deputy minister to corne before
the commrittee, and tell us why farmn bouses
are not included. Also, bouse property aiong
the Red River in the city of Winnipeg has
been flooded, i some cases to a depth of two
or 'tbree feet on the main floor. It wili take
months to repair these buildings and put them
back in shape. I estirnate, too, that rnany
farmers wiii need to spend. frorn 81,500 to
$2,000 on repairs to their homes. Such outlays should be covered in this bill, and it is
our duty in committee to find out frorn the
deputy minister wby they are not.
Hon. Mr. HARDY:- Are not repairs to
fences, and to barns and buildings other than
the farmhouse included? I know that in rny
return I include sucb repairs, save for the
cost of new fencing.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: But the bouse is not
included.
Hon. Mr. HARDY: No.
Hon. MT. HAIG: And when it gets damaged
in thîs way it should be covered. The cost of
repair is not an ordinary expense. The floods
are, if I rnay use a legal terrn, an "act of
God", and costs incurred as a result should be
subject to this exemption provision. Generally
speaking, the floods are worse in Bri.tish Columbia than they are in Manitoba, but about
one hundred and fifty veterans along the Carrot river bave ail lest their farms, and their
bouses are ýflooded out. I do not tbink they
wihl ever be allowed to go back there. In the
Red river and Assiniboine vaiheys it is rnainly
the bouses wbich bave been affected, and
deduction cf the est of repairing tbern sbould
be allowed.

SENATE

Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: These people would
not have any income, would they?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Some of them will. A lot
of that land will be cropped this year.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: They have not sold
last year's crop yet.
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: But if the land is
completely flooded out, the farmers would not
have any income to exempt from.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Probably my honourable
friend was misled by the reference to flooding.
Although in many cases water came into the
farm houses to a level of three or four feet, it
subsequently ran off, and the farmers are sowing oats and flax and barley and expect just
as good crops as ever, if not better.
Hon. A. L. BEAUBIEN: The farmers'
houses would be affected by the water.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Yes. That is why I am
asking that the cost of repairs be considered
for exemption under the bill. Of course, if a
farmer bas no income he will have no exemption; but most of those in the flooded areas
have put in crops.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the second time.

EXCISE TAX BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON moved the second
reading of Bill 332, an Act to amend the
Excise Tax Act.

He said: Honourable senators, I have asked
the honourable senator from Toronto (Hon.
Mr. Hayden) to explain this bill.
Hon. SALTER A. HAYDEN: Honourable
senators, this bill provides for the repeal of
certain taxes as stated in the budget resolutions. For instance, there is provision for the

removal of the tax on places of amusement,
and in addition there are incidental amendments to clear the Act of any references to this
tax, the revenue from which amounted to over
$15 million last year.
Next, there is the removal or repeal of the
25 per cent tax on places of entertainment.
This was a stamp tax, and as there was no way
of segregating the amount received from it,
I am not in a position to inform this bouse
how much revenue was collected under that
particular item. The tax on pari-mutuel

betting, which wias 5 per cent on the amount
of money in the pool on each race, bas been
repealed. The revenue received from that tax
last year was over two and a half million
dollars.
There is a repeal of tlie purchase tax on
certain articles. Some of the articles exempted
this year include watches specially designed for
the use of the blind, and alarm clocks sold at
not more than $10 each. Compared to the total
revenue, the amount received from the tax on
these items bas been small. Formerly, whenever a special type of watch was imported for
or by a blind person, the duty was never paid,
because an order in council was passed providing for exemption.
Under this bill there is also a provision for
the repeal of the 25 per cent tax on 16 millimeter projectors. These are ordinarily used in
churches and schools for educational purposes,
and it was thought proper that this duty

should be removed. However, the duty remains on the various parts of the 35 millimeter
projector, which is the type ordinarily in use
in theatres. The 16 millimeter projector is im,ported into Canada as a unit, whereas in the
case of the other projector the component parts
are imported. The duty is to remain on these
parts.
The special excise tax on certain goods
imported from general tariff countries is repealed. The revenue collected by the government under this head last year amounted to
over $2 million.
A readjustment or rearrangement of the
excise tax upon matches is also provided for.

Apparently some people did not like carrying
too many matches around on their person and

wanted smaller packages.

The size of the

packages and the number of the matches therefore had to be adjusted, and the excise tax is
apportioned accordingly.
The sales tax on certain foods and other
items bas been repealed, and honourable senators will find that the schedule of exemptions
has been repealed and re-enacted sd as to
provide for an increased list of articles on
which the sales tax does not apply. As honourable senators know, the principle of a sales tax
is that it applies to all goods either imported
or sold; then there are the exemptions. These
are provided for by the statute and are set out
in the schedule to the Act. The amendments
in this bill increase the list of exemptions on
a large number of articles of food and other
items. The effective date of all these changes
is May 19.
Honourable senators, I have dealt with the
specifie items to be found listed in the budget
resolutions. In addition there are a number
of miscellaneous sections.

Hon. A. B. COPP presented and moved concurrence in the report of the Standing Coinmittee on Transport and Communications on
the amendýments made by the House of Comnmons to Bill E-5, an Act to amend the Canada
Shipping Act, 1934.
11e said: Honourable senators, the committee
have, in obcdience to the order of reference
of June 2, 1948, considered the said amendments, and now beg leave to report the saine
without any amendment.
Hon. J. J. KINLEY: Honourable senators,
I wish to bring to the attention of the Senate
some aspects of one of these amendments and
to register my opposition to it. In order that
the house may have the background of the
situation, I will read section 113, part II of the
Act, which. deals with certification of masters,
mates and engineers.
113. (1) Every British ship except:
(a) pleasure yachts;
(b) ships solely employed in fishing;
(c) passenger steamships flot exceeding five
tons gross tonnage;
(d) steamships not carrying passengers and
not exceeding ten tons gross tonnage;
(e) barges or other vessels baving neither
masts, sals nor rigglng and not being steamships;

(f) home-trade, inland waters or minor
waters sailing sbips flot exceeding one hundred
and fifty tons register tonnage,
shall wben going from any place in Canada be
provided with masters and mates duly certificated according to the following scale...
Hon. Mr. MORAUD: Excuse me, but what
section is that?
Hon. Mr. KINLEY: That is section 113, in
part II of the Canada Shipping Act, 1934.
The amendments which came before this
house for consideration deleted paragraph (89)
of section 2 of the original Act. I was a member of the committee which studied the
amendments, but, as I said in a previous
speech before this house, I had to go to Nova
Scotia and the matter slipped through without my notice. Some members of the other
bouse spoke to me about it.
The Canada Shipping Act of 1934, paragraph
(89) of section 2, defines a sailing ship as
fohlows:
(80) "Sailing ship" (except as may be provided under tbe Load Lines Rules) means a
ship propelled wbol]y ty sails, and includes a
ship not in exceas of one hundred and fifty tons,
gross tonnage, provided with masts, sails and
rigging sufficient to allow bier to make voyages
un(ler sal alone, and which, in addition, is provided with mecbanical means of propulsion other
than a steam engine.
Thagt is to say, a 150 ton sailing ship with
auxiliary power is excepted fromn the provisions of the Act with respect to masters and
mates and some other matters.
In the committee of the Commons the
definition of a sailing ship was amended to
read as follows:
"Sailing ship," exýcept for the purposes of
the Load Lines Rules, means a ship propelled
wholly by sals, and a ship sole]y employed in
fishing not exceeding one hundred and fifty
tous, gross tonnage, provided with masts, sails
an(l rigging sufficient to aliw bier to make
v1oyages under sal alone, and that, ln addition,
is fitted with mechanical means of propulsion
other than a steam engine.
This puts back part of the original provision,
so that a flshing vessel used solely for fishing
purposes and having an auxiliary engine will
not be classed as a steamship. This means that
the fisherman who operates a boat of over
ten tons and having auxiliary power is now
in this position: hie can go fishing and return
home without a certificated master, but hie
must have one in order to take lis fish to
market in his little vessel. Under the Act the
little coaster would be a "steamship", and
could not carry potatoes fromn Prince Edward
Island to Pictou or coal from Sydney to
Souris without a certified captain.
In the
interests of the fishermen and 'those who

operate srnall vessels on the coast, the dofinition of a sailing ship in the law of 1934 was a
good one, and I do flot know why it was
deleted. I arn told that under pressure the
present definition as it applies to a fishing
vessel was restored. 1 arn told that as ýthe
resuit of and ini accordance with the report
of a judge, these provisions were inserted. If
the question is one of hazard, I arn unable
to se that a vessel equippod with an auxiliary
engine is more of a hazard than a vessel
wholly propelled by sails., A vessel wholly
propelled by sails has right of way over al
power vessels, and is harder to, handie. The
small vessels are operated by practical men
who fish and work on these vessels and
spend thoir lives on the coast, and who have
very littie money with which to hire certificated men to run their boats. In their interests, it seerns to me, we could very well leave
the law as it is.
Speaking in the other place, the honourable
member for Queons-Lunenburg said, in part:
To say, as the bill does, that ail ships of less
than ten tons are sailing ships and ail those of
more than- ten tons are steamahips if they have
any method of propulsion other than sail is
drawing the lino too fine and placing it too low,
in my interprotation of this Act. A ten-ton
boat doos not engage in fishing on the deep
sea, and therefore plays very littie part in -the
deep sea fishing industry. In the achedule to
the Act respecting the international labour
conference, ho'wever, I note that the dividing
ine is drawn at vesols of NO» tons gross
register. It seems to me that would be much
more fitting, sud would give us a certain latitude which is needed.
Consider the case of the lobster fisherinen.
While the boat which is engaged in fighing
does net noed to have a certificated master
and mate, the lobster smatek, which goes out
and col-leets the lobsters and takes them to port,
.may be subject to the provisions of this bill.
Thon we find that the amendment refers to
"a ship solely employed in fishing." If a
man who uses his boat for fishing also does a
little eoasting, apparently he must hae a
certiýficated master because the boat ia not
"solely engaged in fishin.g." If the consideration ia one of safety, the difference bteen
a littie fishing vessel and a coaster is of no

consequence. In the other place members
demanded freedom for the fishing vessel, but
the definition has litt>le meaning, because in
part II under section 13 it is provided, that:
Every British ship except:...
(b) ships so]ely employed in fishing
and some ot-her exceptions
shall when going f rom any place in Canada be
provided with ma8ters and mates duly certificated...

5>47

The law, as it was, should remain, omitting

that part under which. a ship up to 150 tons
with auxiliary power would be classed as a
steamship. In committee we had an animated
discussion on this matter; the vote was vory
close; and I am going to move:
That this bill be recommitted to the comrnittee for the purpose of cutting out of paragraph (89) the words "solehy employed in
fishing".
The paragraph will then read as follows:
"Sailing ship" (except -as may be provided
under the Load Lines Rules) means a ship propelhed wholly by sails, and includes a ship not
in excess of one hundred and fifty tons, gross
tonnage, provided with masts, sails and rigging
sufliciont to allow bier to make voyages under
sail ahane, and whicli, in addition, is provided
with mochanical means of propulsion other than
a steam engine.
That will restore the paragrapli of the Act
of 1934, which was there for many years, and
which is neoded by the small fishermen on the
coast and the mon who live on the shore. It
must be remembered that these mon have to
pass an examination to procure a certificate,
and pay a registration fee of $5 if they want
to sail these little vessels. It seerns to me
that we should have more regard for these

people, who are ýhavîng a difficult time to make
a living along the shore.
I should like ta register another thouglit.
With the present income tax and the passing
of acts that are obnoxious to somne people in
the riding from which I corne, the fishermen
and others will say: 'This is somethin-g -that
we do not like"' and the officiaI will reply, "I
do not make the law. I only carry it out.
It is made by parliament; by Senator Kinley
That is

ahl right, but we ail know here that when a

committee, anyone else mnust know hîs subjeet
well to convince the committee that the departmental representative is not right. I almoat
suceeeded in doing that this morning; in
a comrnittee of twenty membors I failed by
one vote. Although I failed, I deern it ¶ny
duty as ane closely connected with these
people who live along the coasts of this
country to bring ta the attention of parliament what I regard as their right and what I

believe should be retained in their interests.
Honoujable senators, I move the amendment.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.

SENATE

DOMINION SUCCESSION DUTY BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON moved second
reading of Bill 331, an Act to amend the
Dominion Succession Duty Act.
He said: Honourable senators, I have asked
the honourable senator from Inkerman (Hon.
Mr. Hugessen) to explain this bill.
Hon. A. K. HUGESSEN: Honourable senators, this is a bill to anend the Dominion
Succession Duty Act in accordance with the
budget resolutions. As bas occurred in similar
cases, the department concerned has taken
advantage of the bill to propose certain additional amendments in the form of clarifications and corrections. These features of the
bill are of minor importance and can, if necessary, be dealt with in committee. I will deal,
therefore, with only the two major changes
which the bill brings about, both of which
were referred to in the budget resolutions.
The first change is found in subsection 2 of
section 3 of the bill. and permits of complete
exemption from succession duties of property
left to charitable organizations in Canada. At
the present time the exemption on property
left to charity cannot exceed 50 per cent of
the net value of the whole estate. Under the
proposed amendment the whole of an estate
can be left -to charitable organizations in
Canada and thus escape succession duty.
The second and most important -amendment is found in subsection 3 of section 3 of
the bill. It increases the succession duty
exemption on estates from $5,000 to $50,000.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Will the honourable
gentleman permit me to interrupt him at this
point? In anticipation of this bill coming
before the house this matter was discussed
the other day in the Committee on Finance.
As I understand it, succession duty is not
payable to the Dominion Government on an
estate of $50,000. But on what amount is an
estate of $60,000 taxable?
Hon. Mr. HARDY: On $60,000.
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: I am prepared to
deal with that question, and shall be pleased
to do so. At the present time estates of a
value of less than $5,000 are completely
exempted from dominion succession duty. By
this amendment estates of $50,000 or less will
also be completely exempt. I hasten to point
out that this does not mean that the first
$50,000 of an estate is not taxable. For
instance, if a man leaves an estate of $50,100,
a duty will be paid. It is only when the net
value of an estate is $50,000 or less that it
escapes the duty.

Hon. Mr. EULER: Would duty be payable
on the whole $50,000?
Hon. Mr.
explain.

HUGESSEN:

Please

let

me

Hon. Mr. QUINN: Would duty be paid on
$50,100?
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: Let me illustrate
by comparing two estates. Two men die, one
leaving an estate of $49,900 and the other an
estate of $50,100. No duty would be payable
on the first estate, but under the provision
technically termed a "notch provision", set
out in section 3, subsection 4A of the bill, an
estate of $50,100 would in no event pay a succession duty which would reduce its net value
to less than $50,000. In other words, a duty
of $100 would be payable, irrespective of the
rate under normal circumstances. In those
marginal cases provision is made for levying
a duty sufficient to absorb the amount in
excess of $50,000.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: Do I understand
that in every case $50,000 would go to the
beneficiaries or next-of-kin, irrespective of
succession duty?
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: That is so. The
net value of the estate distributable among
the beneficiaries cannot be less than $50,000.
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: Does that apply to
an estate of $60,000?
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: Save for the
exception of this "notch provision", taxes will
be paid on the whole estate at the rates set
out in the schedule to the Act.
Honourable senators will be interested in
knowing that as a result of this proposed
amendment nine out of ten estates now subject to dominion succession duty will be free
of duty.
In other words, nine out of
every ten estates are worth $50,000 or less.
This provision will entail a loss to the treasury,
but it will not be large. I am informed that
in the last fiscal year the total amount of
succession duties levied under the Act was
approximately $32,000,000,
and that the
anticipated loss under this amendment will be
$5,000,000.
I do not know that there is anything I can
usefully add to explain this bill at the second
reading stage. I suggest that, should it receive
second reading, it be referred in the normal
course to the proper standing committee.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: The benefits of this
amendment are restricted to estates of $50,000
or less.

Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: Correct.

.5

JUNE 10, 1948
Hon. Mr. HAIG- There is practically no
reduction, in respect of estates over that
amount.
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: Quite right.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: The rate, I thinik, is 8 or
9 per cent. An estate of $80,000 would be
subjeet to tax on the whole amount.
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: Yes. The only
person who gets the bene-fit of this change is
the man who henefits by this "notch provision' where -the value of the estate is just
ovr$50,000.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I have read the bill. I
think my honourable friend omnitted to say
that it is retroactive to January 1 of this
yearHon. Mr. HUGESSEN: Yes.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: -and there will be soe
refunds in respect of smnal'ler estates. In
the western provinces, and certainly in the
prairie provinces, as the honourable senator
from Rosetown (Hon. Mr. Aseltine) bas
remarked, the proportion of estates to, benelit
will be greater than one in ten, probably more
like one in t1w
enty, although there will be some
important estates. I happen to know that
in the province of Manitoba the total, amount
collected last year in dominion succession duty
fax was ahout $780.000.
There is one provision which, as a practising lawyer, I would like to suggest. I do not
wish to criticize the Winnipeg office, but I do
not believe that the dominion practice, if it
is the saine in the other offices as it is in
Winnipeg-as I understand it is-is as good as
we for.merly had in the province of Manitoba.
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: ln the provincial
office?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Yes. The provincial
practice, which I regard as mucb better, concerns the valuation of estates. Valuation is
always very difficult, especially wheu there
are stocks or bonds or other securîties to be
deal.t with. The relations of my firm and
myself witb the Win.nipeg office bave been
cordial and eutirely satisfactory, but I prefer
the metbods of the provincial department, in
dealing with estates. Their Winnipeg office
paid the Real Estate Exchange $5,000 a year
for valuations, In return, tbe exebange agreed
to make a valuation, of real estate in respect
of any estate. It worked most satisfactorily.
When, upon application for the passing of
succession d-uty, the administrator or bis
officiaIs bad to determine the value of real
property in their district farm lands, for instance, aud their information for estimating

its value was inadequate, they would ask the
Rea)l Estate Exchange to make a valuation.
A similar system in, Toronto or Montreal would,
of course, cost more, but tihe fee is smaîl ini
relation to the size of the estate; and, our
officiais have told me personally that they
have saved many times over, the amount of
the outlay. Prior to that arrangement it
was most difficuit, to establish. valuations; for
instance, in the case of city properties. I
recommend to the departmnent the adoption
of this systemf. ýNobody knows which. valuator will he chosen. The officiais write the
secretary of the exchange stating, for example,
"We would like a valuation of a certain farmn
at St. Jean" or "a house in Brandon": then
the valuation is made; and, as I have said,
the plan lhas worked out very satisfactoriiýy.
The exemption of estates up to, a value of
$50,000 is a move in the right direction. The
amnount involved, is not large, and the ordinary
person will be relieved of what bas always
seemed to me a very unfair tax on a smaîl
estate.
Hon. Mr. HARDY: In Ontario the practice
is-and according to a statemnent made by Dr.
MeCanu. a short time ago, the dominion
department has followed it-to aeeept the
assessment, nlot of necessity nor in a bidebound way, but as the basis of the valuation.
As a general rule, of course, the assessment
value is a little below the real value.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Would the house permit
me to say a word on that point? In Manitoba,
municipalities eau assess land at the unimaproved value or the improved value, or partly
on one basis and partly on the other; and
one municipality may have a low rate of
assessment while another one bas a higber rate
of assessinent. In Manitoba the system of
valuation on municipal assessment was abandoned about twenty years ago; and we shaîl
neyer returu to it.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the second time.
THIRD R.EADING

Hon. Mr. HIJGESSEN: I move that this
bill be referred to the Standing Committee on
Finance.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: We on this sîde do flot
want the bill to be referred to committee. We
are satisfied that it sbould now be read the
third turne.
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: If I may be permitted, and if the bouse concurs in giving the
bill th:ird reading now, I will withdraw my
motion.

SENATE

Hon. Mr. HAIG: You have answered our
questions.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: When shall the
bill be read the third time?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Now.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the third time, and passed.
LOAN COMPANIES BILL
COMMONS AMENDMENTS

CONCURRED

IN

The Senate proceeded to consideration of
the amendments made by the House of Commons to Bill F, an Act to amend The Loan
Companies Act.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Honourable senators, I move concurrence in these amendments which have been received from the other
place. I shall ask the honourable senator from
Inkerman (Hon. Mr. Hugessen) to explain
them. I might point out that the text of the
amendments appears on page 378 of our
Minutes of Proceedings. If the explanation of
the honourable senator from Inkerman should
prove as acceptable as the one he has just
made, perhaps honourable senators will accept
it as sufficient; but if any honourable senator
thinks that the amendments should be referred
back to the committee which originally considered the bill, I shall be quite willing to
adopt that procedure.
Hon. A. K. HUGESSEN: Honourable senators, the amendments made by the House of
Commons to this bill are very simple and,
I think, entirely unobjectionable. The first one
deals with proxies at meetings of shareholders
of companies which are subject to this bill,
and is to the effect that no proxy shall run for
a longer period than one year. That, I think,
is good practice. The second amendment, which
is to section 22 of the bill, simply provides
that if one of these loan companies should
desire to establish the position of chairman of
its board, a chairman of the board may be
appointed. These are the only two amendments. I suggest that they are both simple
and helpful, and that the Senate might accept
them without referring the bill to committee.
The motion was agreed to.
DAIRY INDUSTRY ACT
PROPOSED REFERENCE TO SUPREME COURT

The Senate resumed from yesterday the
adjourned debate on the motion of Hon. Mr.
Euler.
That, in the opinion of this house, the government should, immediately after prorogation of
the present session of parliament, refer to the

Supreme Court of Canada for the opinion of
that court the question of the constitutional
validity of that part of the Dairy Industry Act,
chapter 45 of the Revised Statutes of Canada
1927, which prohibits the manufacture or sale,
or having in possession for sale, or offering for
sale, oleomargarine, margarine, butterine or
other substitute for butter, manufactured wholly
or in part from any fat other than that of milk
or cream.
Hon. WISHART MeL. ROBERTSON: Honourable senators, it will be recalled that yesterday I asked the honourable senator from
Wellington (Hon. Mr. Howard) to adjourn the
debate as Whip in order that I might consider
what I should say in my official capacity, if
anything, in connection with this motion.
As I am a member of the government that
will be asked to consider a certain course of
action if the Senate concurs in this resolution,
I feel that I should not be called upon tu take
any stand either in support of it or in opposition to it. For this reason, too, I believe that
I should be permitted by the Senate to abstain
from voting should the matter corne to a vote.
I am sure that, if this house secs fit to pass the
resolution, the government will consider it carefully, as it does every resolution that cornes
frorn the Senate. It is no light matter to
question the validity of legislation that has
been on our statute books for some sixty years,
during which, I believe-apart frorn the communication that my honourable friend from
Waterloo (Hon. Mr. Euler) said he sent to the
Minister of Justice-no protest has been made
to the governnent at any time. No province
has ever questioned the validity of the statute.
I can only repeat that if the Senate in its
wisdorn ses fit to pass this resolution, I am
sure the government will give it careful
consideration.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Question!
Hon. ARTHUR W. ROEBUCK: Honourable
senators, as I intimated yesterday, I wish to
make some observations with respect to this
resolution. Since my honourable friend the
leader of the government is a part of the
government to whorn the Senate may refer
this matter, I appreciate the stand he has taken.
It is quite proper that he should reserve his
decision until he has heard the representations
of others.
The honourable leader has said that he knows
of no one who has ever taken objection to this
legislation. I have heard many objections over
a considerable length of time, particularly since
the Act has been under consideration in this
house. It is truc that no private individual nor
any province of the dominion bas actually
challenged the legislation in our courts; but
is it sound in principle to maintain legislation,
irrespective of whether or not it is constitu-

JUNE 10, 1948

tional, so long as it is not attacked? The
attacking of legisiation in courts by private
mndividuals is an expensivo procoss, fraugbt
with difficulty and great expenditure af time.
Businessmen have learned that, within reason,
the farther they keep from courts the better.
Furtbýermoro, it is only when established interests are affocted that challenge ta legisiation
niay be contemplated. In this instance the
manufacture of oloomargarine bas been prohibited, s0 there is no manufacturing class ta
take exception ta this legislation. Therefore,
the fact that it bas not been challenged is no
reason for supposing that tbe legislation is
constitutianal; nor is it any roasan why we
sbould refrain from attacking the legislation if
it is not constitutional.
Honourable senators, the maover af this
resolution said that, not being a lawyer, bie
lef t legal interpretation ta mombers of the
lieuse who are qualified in that field. This was
modesty on bis part; yet it did tbrow a certain
responsibility on the lawyors in this bouse ta
express tbeir views. As a humble member of
the legal profession I have some points ta
discuss; and the way is open ta other lawyers
in this bouse ta argue this question.
First, let me make the rather trito statonient that, according ta, section 92 of the
British North America Act, praperty and civil
righits lie within the jurisdiction of provincial
legislatures and not that af tbe dominion parliament
Secondly, there is the equally unchallengeable proposition that the manufacture and sale
of oleomargarine is normnally a civil right.
Oleomargarino is property, and the deals
whereby it is oxcbanged from one persan ta
another are matters of a civil rigbt. Obviously,
if notbing intervenes, sucb mattors are witbin
the jurisdiction of tbe provincial legislatures.
It must not be forgotten, bowever, that tbe
British Nortb America Act gave ta the
Dominion Parliament legislative jurisdiction
over pýeace, order and good gavernmont in
Canada, and over tho criminel law end trade
end commerce. All tbree of tbese classifications may in same way include the subjeetmetter wbicb wo are now discussing; and frecjuently subjeet-matters f ell witbin twa jurisdictions. From one aspect the subject may
came within property end civil rigbts, but
from another aspect it may faîl under the good
gavernment of Canada; it may be a matter of
criminal îlaw, of trede and commerce,1 or af
something else witbin the meny divisions of
the British North Americe Act. It thereforo
becames a matter af judgment, aided by precedent, toaescertain wbat is the autstanding
purposeofa the logislation, in order ta, determine whether in the main it falîs within one or

5.53

other of the classifications, and consequently
within one or other of the jurisdictions.
I might also add at this moment that peace,
order and good government is a subject which
expands and contracts according to conditions.
In times of crisis, such as war or an upheaval
of nature, a subject.-matter whicb normally
falis within. one of the other cla.ssifications of
the British North America Act may be transferred ta the classification of peace, order and
good government, because the necessity of
maintaining peace, order and good government
in this country is superior to the other rights,
say of property or what-not.
A subject-matter which mnay ho instanced
as falling witbin two jurisdictions is that of the
liquor tradte. As honourable senators will
realize, liquor is a commodity, just as is, for
exemple. oleomargarine. And, being a coinmodity, liquor is property, and the sale of
liquor is theo exercise of a civil -right. But the
courts held a good many years aga, in the
case of Russel v. The Queen, (1882) Appeal
Cases, page 829, that the Dominion Parliament
was competent to enact what is known as the
Canada Temperance Act, whicb under certain
circumstances prohibited or regulated the sale
of liquor in certain places. The reasoning
behind the court's decision was that although
liquor is property and its sale is the exorcise, of
a civil right, there were phases of the subj octmatter which brought it witbin the section
empuwering the Dominion Parliament to make
laws for the peace, order and good government of Canada. I should like to read a
passage from the Privy Council's judgment in
that case. At page 838 their Lordships made
this statement:
Their Lordships cannot tbink that the Temperance Act in question properly belýongs to the
class of subjects, "Property and Civil Rights."
It bas in its legal aspect an obvious and close
sirnilarity ta laws wbicli place restrictions on
the sale or custody of poisonous drugs, or of
dangerously explosive substances.
I do not know wbat similarity there is
betwoen explosive substances and lîquor, but
their Lordships wero able to find an analogy.
These things, as 'well as intoxicating liquors,
can, of course, be held as property, but a law
plaeing restrictions on their sale, custody, or
removal, on the grounid that the fTee sale or use
of tbem is dangerous ta public safety, and
making it a criminal offence punishable *by
fine or imprisonment ta violats these restriçtions, can-not properly be deemed a law in relation ta property in the sense in whicha those
words are used in the 92nd section. What parliament is dealing with in legislation of tbis
kind is nat a matter in relation ta property
and its rights, but one relating ta public order
and safety. That is tbe primary inatter dealt
with, and though incidentally the free use of
things in -whieh men may have property is interfered with. that incidental interference does not

SENATE
alter the character of the law. Upo the saine
considerations, the Act in question cannot be
regarded as legislation in relation to cvil rights.
In however large a sense these words are used,
it could not have been intended to prevent the
Parliament of Canada from declaring and enacting certain uses of property, and certain acts in
relation to property, to be criminal and wrongful. Laws which make it a criminal offence for
a man wilfully to set tire to his own house on
the ground that such an act endangers the
publie safety, or to overwork his horse on the
ground of cruelty to the animal, though affecting in soine sense property and the right of man
to do as lie pleases with his own, cannot properly be regarded as legislation in relation to
property or to civil rights. Nor could a law
which prohibited or restricted the sale or exposure of cattle having a contagious disease be
so regarded. Laws of this nature designed for
the promotion of -public order, safety, or morals,
and which subject those who contravene then
to criminal procedure and punishment, belong
to the subject of public wrongs rather than to
that of civil rights.
Honourable senators will appreciate that the
courts in that instance upheld the infringement of property and civil rights on the ground
that the Canada Temperance Act had for its
main purpose the protection of the public
from what their lordships at that time considered to be an explosive substance: that is
to say, liquor. It was the peace, order and
good government of Canada upon which
parliament was iegislating rather than the civil
riglts of persons who buy and sell.
Hon. Mr. KINLEY: That did not have to
do with the manufacture of liquor?
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: No. But the right
to manufacture is a civil right, just as the
right to sell is a civil right.
Hon. Mr. KINLEY: Can a province
prevent manufacture within its own territory?
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: As I said before,
many things will fall into two classifications:
in -one aspect they will be within the legislative jurisdiction of the Dominion Parliament,
while in other aspects they remain subject to
provincial regulation. It may be that oleomargarine is one of those things, but that will
be for the courts to decide. In the case to
which I have referred, it was held that the
Dominion Parliament had power to prohibit
the sale of liquor wherever and whenever the
Canada Temperance Act applied, but that did
net deprive the provincial legislatures of
power to regulate other conditions of manufacture, storage, sale or disposal.
Hon. Mr. KINLEY: That case deals with
the Scott Act?
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: Yes, the so-ealled
Scott Act, or the Canada Temperance Act.

As to the prohibition of the sale of oleomargarine, in my judgment the question for
the courts to consider is whether the purpose
of the prohibition, which touches property
and civil rights, also falls within one of three
classes of subjects in section 91: the criminal
law, the regulation of trade and commerce,
or laws for the peace, order -and good government of Canada. I know of no other class in
section 91 within which it could fall; and, in
iy opinion, if the courts decide that it does
not come within one of those three classes, it
mnust then be a matter beyond the jurisdiction
of the Dominion Parliament.
One of the cases whicb I presume the court,
if this matter is referred te it, would quite
properly consider is the Toron/o Electric Comi.ssioncrs v. Snider, (1925) Appeal Cases,
page 396. With your indulgence, honourable
senators, I shall read froi the head-note a
statement of the facts of the case.

It

is as

follows:
The Industrial Disputes Investigation Act,
1907, of Canada, provided that upon a dispute
occurring between employers and employees in
any of a large number of important industries
in Canada the Minister for Labour for the
Dominion night appoint a Board of Investigation and Conciliation. The Board was to make
investigations, with power ta summon witnesses
and inspect documents and prenises, and vas
to try to bring about a settlement; if no settleaent resulted, they were to make a report with
recomniendations as to fair ternis. but the
report was not to be binding upon the parties.
After a reference to a Board a lock-out or
strike was te be unlawful, and subject ta penalties.
It was beld that:
The Act was not within the competence of the
Parliainent of Canada under the British North
America Act, 1867. It clearly was in relation
to property and civil rights in the provinces, a
subject reserved to the Provincial Legislatures
by s. 92, sub-s. 13, and was net within any of
the overriding powers of the Dominion Legislature specifically set out in s. 91; the Act could
not be justified under the general power in
s. 91 to make laws "for the peace, order, and
good government of Canada," as it was net
established that there existed in the matter any
emergency which put the national life of Canada
in unanticipated peril.
Is there not some analogy between the subject-matter of the motion before this house
and the facts of that case as considered by the
court at that time.
Hon. Mr. BURCHILL: Was that a decision
of the Supreme Court of Canada?
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: That is a decision of
the Privy Council in England.
The point is that there is no public peril
against which protection should be given by
the legislation in question; therefore, the
provision of peace, order, and good govern-

JUNE 10, 1948
ment can scarcely be invoked for the purpose
of taking the subject-matter out of its normal
classification of property and civil rights.
The head-note continues:
Russell v. The Queen (1882), in the light of
later decisions, can be supported only upon the
assumption that the Judicial Committee considered that when the Dominion Act then in
question was passed the evil of intemperance
amounted in Canada to an emergency of the
kind above mentioned.
Since the decision in Toronto Electric Commissioners v. Snider, it is settled opinion in the
legal profession that the invasion of the provincial field of property and civil rights by the
Dominion Parliament was justified in Russell
v. The Queen only because of a public emergency and for the protection of public morals,
public safety or something of that kind.
I wish also to refer to the case of Attorney-

General for British Columbia v. AttorneyGeneral for Canada, (1937) Appeal Cases, page
377. This case, in which I participated in the
argument, concerns the Marketing Act. It was
held that control of the sale of agricultural
products, apart from interprovincial and
foreign trade, came within property and civil
rights, and not within any classification of
section 91 of the British North America Act.
A most significant decision was referred to
yesterday by my good friend the honourable
senator from Parkdale (Hon. Mr. Murdock),
who is patiently listening to me now. I refer to

In re the Board of Commerce Act, 1919, and
the Combines and Fair Prices Act, 1919,
reported in Volume I, (1922) Appeal Cases,
page 191. The head-note reads as follows:
The Combines and Fair Prices Act, enacted
by the Parliament of Canada in 1919, authorized the Board of Commerce, created by another
statute of that year, to restrain and prohibit
the formation and operation of such trade combinations for production and distribution in the
provinces as that board might consider to be
detrimental to the public interest; the board
might also reatrict accumulation of food, clothing, and fuel beyond the amount reasonably required, in the case of a private person for his
household, and in the case of a trader for his
business, and require the surplus ta be offered
for sale at fair prices; and the board could
attach criminal consequences to any breach of
the Act which it determined to be improper.
This case presented a rather negative
approach, requiring the sale of commodities
rather than prohibiting their sale; it also set
the terms upon which sales m'ight be made.
The case concerns interference with civil rights
in the buying and selling of commodities; and
the principles involved are similar to those
affected by the motion before us.
In that case it was held:
That the acts were ultra vires the Dominion
legislature, since 'hey interfered seriously with

555

"property and civil rights in the provinces," a
subject reserved exclusively to the provincial
legislatures by s. 92, head 2, of the British
North America Act, 1867, and were not passed
in any highly exceptional circumstances, such
as war or famine, which conceivably m'ight
render trade combinations and hoarding subjects outside the heads of s. 92 and within the
general power given by s. 9.1. The power of
the Dominion legislature to pass the acts in
question was not aided by s. 91, head 2 (trade
and commerce), since they were not within the
general power; nor hy s. 91, head 27 (the criminal law), because the matter did not by its
nature belong ta the damain of criminal jurisprudence.
The whole decision is full of interest to
those studying this particular question of the
manufacture and sale of oleomargarine. For
instance, on page 199 you will find these
observations by their lordships:
As their lordships have already indicated,
the jurisdiction attempted ta be conferred on
the new Board of Commerce appears ta them
ta be ultra vires for the reasons now discussed.
It implies a caim of title, in the cases of nontraders as well as of traders, ta make orders
prohibiting the accumulation of certain articles
required for every-day life, and the withholding
of such articles from sale at prices to be defined
by the board, whenever they exceed the amount
of the material which appears ta the board to
be required for domestic purposes or for the
ordinary purposes of business. The board is
also given jurisdiction to regulate profits and
dealings which may give rise ta profit. The
power ta be given to the board applies ta
articles produced for his own use by the householder himself, as .well as ta articles accumulated, not for the market but for the purposes
of their own processes of manufacture by manufacturers. The board is empowered ta inquire
into individual cases and to deal with them
individually, and not merely as the result of
applying principles ta be laid down as of general application. This would cover such instances as those of coal mines and of local provincial undertakings for meeting provincial
requirements of social life.
Legislation setting up a Board of Commerce
with such powers appears ta their lordships ta
be beyond the powers conferred by e. 91. They
find confirmation of this view in s. 41 of the
Board of Commerce Act, which enables the
Dominion executive ta review and alter the
decisions of the board. It bas already been
observed that circumstances are conceivable.
such as those of war or famine, when the peace,
order and good government of the Dominion
might be inperilled under conditions so exceptional that they require legislation of a
character in reality beyond anything provided
for by the enumerated heads in either s. 92 or
s. 91 itself. Such a case, if it were ta arise,
would have ta be considered closely before the
conclusion could properly be reached that it
was one which could not be treated as falling
under any of the heads enumerated.
Note how reluctant the courts are to take
a subject-matter out of one of the enumerated
heads and include it in the general powers, the
over-riding powers of the Dominion Parlia-

SENATE

ment under section 91, to make laws for peace,
order and good government.
In the liglit of these authorities I ask myseif,
does the manufacture and sale of oleomargarine satisfy any of these overriding provisions which I have mentioned sufficiently to
take it out of provincial jurisdiction and put
it under the control of this parliament? The
question nould not be couched in those words,
but that would be the substance of the problem
which, were this resolution to pass and were
the government to accept our advice, would
be referred to the courts. Let me consider
these three heads individually.
First, the question of trade and commerce. It
is certain that the sale or the manufacture of
oleomargarine does not fall within the classification of interprovincial trade. Nor does it
fali within the class of foreign trade or international trade. It is local trade, just as is the
manufacture of any other commodity. Interprovincial tradi.ng, of course, is regulated by
the Dominion. The Dominion Government
could say that oleomargarine manufactured in
Ontario might or might not, be sold in the
province of Manitoba; that i.s, provided that
in s0 doing they did not infringe, as I believe
they would, other sections of the act.
And they might regulate the sale not only
from one province te, another but fromn the
Dominion to some foreiga country. But the
regulation would apply only to that portion
of the trade which was interprovincial or
international; and this Act does not in any
degree, under any of its phases, affect trade
in oleomargarine on an interprovincial or
international basis. It prohibîts totally. So
that this Act does not fail within trade or commerce; and in this connection I would recaîl
what I have already said about the decision
in Attorney-General of British Columbia v.
Attorney-General of Canada in what was
called the Marketing Act case.
Another heading ýis that of criminal law.
Argument upon that feature is unnecessary:
the sale of oleomargarine doca not remotely
resemble anything which. falîs within the category of criminal law.
Next cornes the question of peace, order and
good government-that classification which
justified many acts of the Dominion Parliament in the late war.
Many interferences
with civil rights werc justified under that
broad over-riding power in section 91, "the
peace, order and good goverament of Canada".
Hon. Mr.
program.

KINLEY:

And

Mr. Bennett's

Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: My honourable
friend interjects "Mr. Bennett's program". If
wvas attempted to justify, on the ground of

pence, order and good government, the Bennett
program, which. was a series of Aets of parliament. But su far as I remember at this moment, in not one case was the legislation upheld
on that ground; and as respects a very large
amount of legialation, i.ncluding the Marketing
Act to which I have referred as analogous f0
the case before us, the Dominion's compefency
was denied. I think I can say with positiveness that the sale of oleomargarine does not
affect in any way public order in Canada.
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: Only in the Senafel
Hon. Mr. ROEBUICX: There is nothing disorderly about the sale of oleomargarine. There
is nothing which threatens in any way-I
mean, withiin the legal meaning of the wordsthe peace, harmony and well-being of the
people of this Dominion.
ýHon. A. L. BEAUBIEN: If might kilI somebody.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUGK: No, ýit will not kili a
single soul, although it might build up the
bodies of some. But we are flot arguing at the
moment the merits, we are arguing only the
question of law.
Nor has the sale of oleomnargarine any relevance to the safety of the state, which is one
of the phrases so often used f0 justify the
transfer of some subi ect of legi.slation from
property and civil rights to the over-riding
powers of the Dominion Parliament. In this
legislation there is no reference to the safety
of the state.
There is no effeet upon public morals such as
seems to have influenced the Law Lords in 1882
in Russell v. The Quea when they upheld the
legislation of the Dominion Parliament controlling the sale of liquor under some circumstances.
Finally, the crisis through which Canada bas
recently passed is now four years gone by, and
in Canada today therc is no crisis bcyond that
which always exists and whicli isý fot of the
type ref'erred t'o by the Law Lords. I sec no
reason 10 justify taking the sale and manufacture'of oleomnargarine out of provincial jurisdiction and transferring it to dominion jurisdiction.
Believing, as I do, that Ibis legislation is
ultra vires of this parliament, I submit that it
ought to be referred to tbe courts in order f0
determine auîhoritatively the constitutional
question involved. The Dominion Parliament
should not, in good public morals, maintain on
the statute books legislation wbich. is beyond
its control. If this legislation is ultra vires of
this parliament, il should be repealed and
abolished.
We have enough to do within
the powers granted us by the British North

JUNE 10, 1948
America Act, without assuming rights we do
flot possess, and which it would be immoral
for us to attempt to exercise.
Honourable senators, I support this resolution.
Hon. Mr. KIýNLEY: May I ask the honourable senator a question? He has given his
opinion-and it is only his opinion-that this
legisiation is ultra vires, as it is a matter of
property and civil rights and therefore cornes
under the jurisdiction of the provinces. Suppose that tomorrow the attorney general of a
province is of the saine opinion and has a law
passed permitting the manufacture and sale of
oleomargarine in that province, which he can
do, w'hat would happen to that section of the
British North America Act which provides that
there muet be free trade between the provinces?
Hon. Mr. EULER: He does not need a law;
he has the power now.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: I do not think the
section of the British North America Act
referred to. would be affected. There would be
two statutes on the books, one enactcd by the
Dominion and the other hy the province,
each antagonistic to the other. They would
remain on the statute books until some private
interest attacked the legisiation and the matter
came before the courts, when the judges would

557

decide that one or the othcr of the Acte was
ultra vires of the legisiature which cnacted it.
The statutes might remain unaffected until the
provincial executive or the Dominion executive
referred the whole matter to the courts, mn
conformity with certain powers, possessed hoth
in the Dominion and the provinces, to refer to
the courts matters which they think should be
clarified.
Hon. Mr. KINLEY: You sce how involved
the matter becomes.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: "Oh, what a tangled
web we weave, when first we practise to,
deceive 1"
Hon. Mr. KINLEY: In the United States
the Supreme Court held that it was a matter
of trade and commerce, and thus the legisiation
of the individual states was over-ridden.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK; According to the
Constitution of the Ujnited States, drawn in
1787, "trade -and commerce" in that country is
entirely different from "trade and commerce"
as referred to in our statute of 1867.

CUSTOMS TARIFE BILL

EEFERRED TO COMMITI'EE

SECOND READING

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON moved that the
bill be referred to the Standing Committee on
Finance.
The motion was agreed to.

Hon. WISHART McL. ROBERTSON
moved second reading of Bill 333, an Act to
âmend the Customs Tariff Act.
He said: This bill contains that part of the
budget proposais which relates to tariffs and
customs. It wili be remembered that several
bis have been presented for our consideration: ail, with one exception, have been referred to the Standi.ng Committee on Finance.
I shall make a brief resume of, the contents
of this bill, and if honourabie senators require
additional information it can be secured througb
the medium of our Com*mittee on 'Finance,
to whîch I shahl ask that the bill be referred,
and at whose meeting tomorrow morning
departmentai officiais w.11 be in attendance.
In the flrst place, there are a number of
minor tariff changes, ail downward, which
will be of some heip in reducing the operating
costs of a number of industries. The second
main feature of the bill is to provide for the
temporary suspension of the British preferential
duti.es on cotton and rayon piece-goods until
June 30, 1949, subjeet to iestoration at any
time before that date by the Governor in
Council, shouid that become desirable. In view
of our undertaking at Geneva not to widen
existing preferential margins, this invoives a
corresponding reduction in the most-favourednation rate on these goods. These duties have
been temporarily lifted on the undertaking
by the British government that every effort
wouid be made to meet the shipment target of
80,000,000 yards of cotton piece-goods in 1948,
and that, through price reductions in British
textiles, equivaient benefits would accrue to
the Canadian consumer.
The concession of these duties will heip
Britain to regain hier market in Canada for
textiles by enablimg them to be soid at a more
competitive price, and wiii thereby heip to
reduce the baiance-of-payments gap between
the United Kingdom and Canada. As a precaution against unforeseen and unfavourabie
deveiopments, the goverument is asking that
it have the power to restore these duties to
their former level by order in council. This
precaution is considered desirabie in the unsettied state of present world trading and financiai conditions.
Other minor changes included in the bill are
of an administrative or drafting character.
Perhaps the most important is the substitution of the name "most-favoured-nation tariff"
for "intermediate tariff".
The motion was agreed to and the bill was
read the second time.

INSUIRANCE

CýOMPANIES

BILL

SECOND READING

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON moved the
second reading of Biii N-il, an Act to amend
the Canadian and British Insurance Coinpanies Act, 1932, and the Foreign Insurance
Companies Act, 1932.
H1e said: Honourable senators, the purpose of this bill is to eniarge to some extent
the investment powers of Canadian insurance
companies, and to extend the field of investments in which British and foreign insurance
companies may invest in trust for Canadian
policyhioiders. This refers of course to those
rnsurancc companies which are now doing
business in Canada.
New types of investment are continuaiiy
coming into existence, consequentiy it is
desirabie to enlarge from time to time the
powers of Canadian insuranice companies,
to enable them to take advantage of new
opportunitics.
This is essentiai in order
that the cost of insurance may be kept as low
as possihle through the maximum interest
revenue consistent with safet.y of principal,
and aiso that the companies may put their
funds to work in ways that wili contribute
most to the weifare of the economic system
of the naticn asýa whole.
The companies dlaim to be experiencing
more and more difficuity in finding suitabie
investment outiets for their funds within the
present investment provisions of the Act,
partly by reason of the changes in these
provisions3 in recent years. In many instances
too, Canadian companies appear to be at a
substantiai competitive disadvantage, even in
Canada, because of the rehatively wider investment powers possessed ýby British and foreign
insurance companies doing business here.
Representatives of the companies have been
conferring for several months with the officiais
of the Department of Insurance with a view
to a possible revision of the existing provisions
wherever appropriate, and whiie these discussions have not yet been completed, the
present bill is a step towards a reasonable
extension of investment powers.
Honourabie senators wiil note that ost,
sections (1) and (2) of section 1 of the bill
relate to essentiaiiy the saine subject, nameiy,
giiaranteed or insured mortgages. Subsection

SENATE

(1) relates to the powers of a company to
invest, and subsection (2) relates to powers
te lend.
One of the main provisions in the Act wjth
respect to investments in mortgages or loans
upon real estate is the saine as that found in
many statutes governiug investmeuts, uamely,
that a mortgage shall fot exceed 60 per cent
of the value of the rcal estate securiug the
mortgage.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Appraised value?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Yes, appraised
value. However, in 1935 a new type of
"insured" mortgage originated in the United
States under the National Housing Act of that
country.
Under the Act relatively larger mortgages
could bc arrauged, and their safety was insured
by the LUited States Govcrnmyent through the
Fecr al Housing Administrator. These mortgages prox cd te be a very desirable form of
investinent foi, insurance companies,' and our
Act was anîcndcd lu 1944 to authorize CanaMortdian companies te inved in thom.
recently, other similar plans have been formulated beth in Canada and the United States.
Under the terrms of the llousing Develdopment
Act, 1948, passed at the last session of the
Ontario legislature, the goverminent of that
province may guarantee boans made for bousIn the United States addiing purpeses.
tiouai luaris flay now bc arranged through the
Administrater- of Veterans Affairs, and these
additieual boans carry the guarantee of the
United States goe rament.
The effeet of the amendments made by
subsectiens (1) and (2) of section 1 of the
present bill is te make general the existing
pr ovisions reiating te ene plan of insured or
guarauteed mortgage, and thus be enable ceinpanies te take mortgages in excess of 60 par
cent of the value of the real estate where the
exccss is insured or guaranteed by the national,
prov'incial or state gevernmcnt, and is, therefore, virtua'lly as secure as the bonds of that
government.
Subsection (3) of section 1 of the bill1
authorizes investments, net falling within the
specified classes, up te 3 per cent of a ceinpany's total assets. This is a new principle
in the Act, designed te give the companies a
small amount of investment freedom, which,
howevcr, is stibject te certain exceptions and
limitations.
In many new fields of investment it is
becoming increasingly difficult, te, specify tests
that will ensure safety, and sometimes the best
mnvestment oppertunities in new fields are part
before the necessary ameudments te the Act
can be made; sometimes, tee, investments,

very similar to and equally as sound as some
of those authorized, are obtainable, but are
ruled eut because of the specified proscriptions
in the Act. In Great Britain the insurance
cempanies bave practically 100 per cent freedom, aud recently several of the American
states have amended their laws te permit freedem te the extent of 5 per cent or 7-j per cent
of a company's assets. It is therefore considered that the proposed lirait of 3 per cent
for Canadian cempanies is reasonable and safe.
In this connection the fact sbould net be overleeked that, whether investment fields are
restricted or net, the final responsibility for
inaking wise investmeuts always rests in the
same place, uamely, in the company's management.
It should be noted that the wider powers
that wiPl be conferred upon the companies
under thc pruposed new subsection are neyertheless subjeet te the general restrictions and
prohibitions in the subsequeut subsections of
section 60, and aIse te the provisions of the
new subsectien itself. Most of the latter are
rmanifest, exeept the reference in subparagraph
(ii) te "the first previso te subparagraph (y)
of paragrapb (b) Mf subsection oue". The
pro ise here referrcd te stipulates that net
more than 30 per cent of the total issues of tbe
siocks of any corporation shahl be purcbased
by any company, that ne company shahl invest
in its own shares, and that ne life insurance
cempaay shaîl invcst iu the shares of any other
iife insurance coînpany.
Sections 2 and 3 of tbe bill mere!y extend the
existing provisions of the arts rclating te the
assets of British and foreign companies that
niav ho vested in trust for Canadian policyliolders, se that the minister, witb the approval
of the Treasury Board, may ho in a position te
accord to British and foreiga insurance companies transacting business in Canada, treatment which is simîlar as far as practicable
te that accorded te Canadian companies.
This is a bill in which undeubtedlv a good
miau' senaters are interested. White I bave
endeavoured te explain its contents as clearly
as I could. on the information provided te me,
1 intend te move after the second reading that
the bill be referred -te the Standing Committee
on Baukiug and Commerce, in order that
further information may be obtainable from
departmental officiais.
Hon. JOHN T. HAIG: Honourable senators,
I amn net, altegether opposed te this bill, but it
bas seme provisions that I do net like. There
are reasons for the legislation, and they are net
far te seek. The first reason is that the
government's policy as te money control bas
reduced the interest rate on gevernimeut bonds

JUNE 14, 1948
to a Iower level than that on. which most compallies have based their policies. That bas
created a tremendous difficul-tv. The dividend
that you get on a paid-up policy flow is at so
low a rate that, 'to say the least, it is most
disappointing. The reduction of interest on
governmen-t bonds has driven. the insurance
companies to desperation in their efforts to get
jnvestmnents for their surplus funds.
Hon. Mr. DUEF: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I was not surprised when I
read this bill the other day. The insurance
business is a most difficuit business to protect.
However well managed a company may be,
nobody can. tell what may happen to its
investments in the future.
The government's policy of low interest bas
not made cbeap money available to the people
who need it; it has meant cheap money for
the government only. 1 think the government
would be well advised to let up on its control,
so that cheap money may become available
for investments other than government bonds.
Ail the people wbo live on investments are
suffering as much as any people can possibly
suifer from decreased income. Widows and
children who were left -unis of money invested
at 5 per cent now find that their investments
bring in only 2% per cent, and they are having
great difficulty in getting along. Wbat makes it
particulnrly bard for themn is that the increase
in the cost of living bas been far more -than the
150 per cent wbicb the officiai figures indicate.
These figures are based on rent-controlled
properties, not on the cost of new buildings.
My second.point is that our taxes-dominion,
provincial and municipal-are so beavy that it
is impossible for a company to build up much
of a reserve for investment or for any other
purpose. I admit tbat under this bill a company can make investmnents in certain new
fields, but only up to 3 per cent of the book
value of the company's total assets. Tbe
present law permits boans on a property to a
maximum of 60 per cent of the appraised value,
and it is proposed by the bill that this proportion. may be exceeded only wbere a government
is on tbe guarantee.
In speaking the other day on tbe National
Housing Bill I stated tbat I did nlot tbink there
would be any bouses built under that particular
measure. But wbat do we see some insurance
companies doing?
'In the city of St. Boniface a large insurance
company bas taken over part of a golf course,
and is constructing streets and sewers, preparatory to building bouses. I do not believe it was
ever intended that insurance companies should,
undertake such projects. Tbey may have the
legal right to do it, but tbat type of speculation
5853--37J

b as eost some of us a lot of money. No matter
bow carefully we look at things, we can make
mistakes. For instance, four years ago tbe.
government built a structure costing 3300,000,
just fourteen miles out of Winnipeg on Hîghway No. 1. Today it is aIl boarded up, and la
about to be burned or torn down. Surely the
goverfiment sbould bave known wbat it was
doing when it invested sucb a sum of money.
Hon. Mr. QUINN:
project?

Was tbat a bousing

Hon. Mr. HAIG : No. It was built as a
veterans' hospital or recreation centre. Wben
the government is so far wrong in seine of
its decisions, is it not possible tbat tbe insurance executives might also be wrong? When
a building is completed, and is appraised by
a competent valuator, an insurance company
may lend up to 60 per cent of tbe value. I
can see no reason why these companies should
be allowed to go into speculative investments.
For the ordinary man or woman wbo wants
to borrow, money is no cbeaper today tbat it
was ten years ago. In every city in Canada
there are certain companies whicb lend money
at rates as bigh as 24 per cent per year.
Tbere are a baîf dozen such companies in
Montreal, in Vancouver and in my own city.
Tbey do not lend cbeap money to the people
who need it most. Tbis bill is intended to
get around the cheap money policy of tbe
government. and to prevent the companies
from attempting to accumulate res-erves because
of excessive taxation.
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: May I interrupt my
honourable friend? It is quite obvious tbat
this bill is complementary to the housing billl
which was passed here last week.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: That is quite true. I arn,
not afraid of tbat feature of the bill; that la,
a small part of it.
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: I cannot follow myfriend's argument wben hie says that this bill
is an attempt to get around the cbeap money
policy.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: That is not what I meant.
The governmnent, by controlling bond interest
at 2t per cent, is getting ebeap money; but
alI the people do nlot get the benefit of the
low rate. Wben the ordinary person bas te
borrow money, hie pays as bîgh as 24 per cent.
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT- Tbat is net the
samne thing.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: It is just the same tbing.
Only large corporations can borrow money at
low interest rates.

SENATE

I urn fot going to, oppose the bill; but I
want to know the reasen for it. It does flot
imipress me wlin my honourable friend the
leadi r of the governmnent (Hon. Mr. Robertson) says that this kind of legisiation lias
been passed in the U'nited States. I know of
ne country in the world that took the dusting
on the money situation that the United States
did in tbe period of 1930-33, whien banks went
broke ami were closed. and it teck a mcst able
president to save themn.
I do net know w'hat the financial position
of Great lijitain is going te be. We have
already lent lier liug- sumns of money. I hope
mweget iL bae-k, but I arn net confident that
we will. It i.s my vicw ibat we shculd paddle
our- ewn canee and nec be tee cager te follow tbe experiments cf ether ceuntries until
the ' b ave been prcved by positive results.
I do net like legisiatien that removes protectiuij froin the savings cf tbe people. These
large iinsurance conipanies have inspectors who
go arcund and look at prcperties; but I know
cf one large crnpany wbirb in 1932 carne te
the Prime Minister cf Canada and said "The
jig is nip", wbereupen lie intreduced legisiatien tbiat gave tlîen ten years te value their
assets, andi tliey get by.
Wc arc net at ail suie that our present
prosperitv will continue ferever. It is quite
plain tbat tbe world today is xvaiting with
bated breath te bcri wbat the United States
Congrcss xviii de witbi the European assistance
,piograrn. 'Wben tbc clectcd representatives in
,Lkat country today vote toecut the assistance
by 26 per cent, wbat xviii bappen a year frein
now xxbex things are harder te get? Are tbey
iikeiy te increase the ameunt or toecut it
down? That is a question ne one can answer.
I believe that cur presenit presperity cannet
continue in the face of the anxiety cf the
wbeole werld about the United States lending
policy. Our assistance te Great Britain cf 3

billion 100 million by way cf gift and mutual
aid vas supposed te carry that country through
its difficulties.
But tbat is ail gene. We
then lent bier a further billion and a quarter.
Now the billion is gene and the quarter is
prefty iveli spent, and she is grasping for more
money. Wben we are asked te consider the
responsibilities cf insurance cempanies te their
pehieybolders. we should net forget ail these
conditions.
When the bill goes te cemmittee I întend te
ask the officiais what is the basis for it. To say
that the United States or Great Britain bias
similar legislation is ne answer. I have te
be shcwn that cur policyheolders arc being
protected.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I was net advancing the argument that because the United
States did something Canada should do it.
I was pcinting eut the policy adopted by the
governiicnt in tbis matter. There is conclusive evidence that during the war and pestwar period this country, under the leadersbip
cf the presenit government, bas afforded te the
werld many striking instances of success in ail
fields. This is another instance cf the coolness and care cf tbe governent in financial
matters-a pehicy whicb bias brougbit Canada
te the happy position she is in tcday, and
w ich, in mn opinion, she will maintain in the
years tlîat lie abead.
The motion was agreed te, and tbe bill was
re-fd tbe second time.

QUEBEC SAVINGS BANKS BILL
SECOND READJING

lion. Mr. ROBERTSON moved the second
reading af Bill Y-11, an Act ta, arnend the
Quebec Savings Banks Act.
Hie said: Honourable senatars, I have asked
the honourable senator from Grandville ta
explain this bill.
Hon. P. H. BOUFFARD: Han ourable
senatars, a little over 100 years ago the
parliarnent of the two provinces af Canada
passed what is known as the Quebec Savings
Banks Act, flhaptr'r 14 of the Revised Statutes
of Canada, 1927, uinder which two banks were
incorporatcd: one, the Montrent City and

SENATE

District Savings Bank, in Montreal; the other,
the Quebec Savings Bank, ia the city of

Q uebec.
The purpose of these two banks is to,
,encourage small savings. Ail thc accounts are
savings accounts of fiom 25 cenit, up; to
$3,000 they hear interest at 2 per cent per
annîîm. TÈhey are opened and kept without
anly charge to the depositors. The banks
remain open in the even.ings for the convenience of their clients, people of the workingý closs. It hias been found that most people
saving mon.ey in these two institutions arc
small depositors who do net touch their
accounats except, in speciai cirdumstances. suchi
aes for the higher education of a child, sickness
in the family, or the purchase of a small busiflcs or a home.
Over Lhe last nin-etv-nine years the Quehec
Savingi !Bnk bas increascd its establishînent
to fourtecýn branches, most of which are

special fatýlities for scheol childvýen, and takes
deposits of from 25 cents up. Lt is uszed mainly
by people wýho make vcry small deposits cither
weekly or mon.thly. It lias fulfilcd the purpose of its incorporation so well that, it has
approximatly 46.000 aecounts, of which over
37,000 are for less than $500.
The Act lias flot hc'n greatly arnended since
it was first passedi. By reference to it honourable s'enators will notice that the, hanks mav
'ivest th-i i, escrves in nothing hut flrst-class
securt!cs, :i1('l as the bonds of the dominion,
the provinces. the mutnici;ialities. schools, and
of a fe-w olher bodies.
'Of late years it, has been feît that these
banks cou'ld increce.s their services to clients.
Suppose, as often happens, that a man who
for a long time hias hiad a small accounit at one
of the hanks needs to horrow money to meet
sonie emergency. Up to the present time ho
bas no( heen ahle to get a loan froin the bank
unless lie lias bail (ollateral equivaient in value
to at least dhe ainount hie wishies to horrowv.
Or take the case of a depositor who want.,- to
start a small business, or buy a bouse. Regardles of how long his account has been in existence, he cannot borrow the funds needed,
be.cause the bank is prohihited from. accepting a mortgage on his business or house as
sedurity.
Tbe purpose of tlîis bibi is to extend the
powcrs of these two banks in two ways. First,
its proposes that the banks niay make personal boans witbout s£ecurity,; and secondiy,
that tlîey may iend on iminovahie property
which bas been improved. A hank wouid no4

Will the honourable
Wbat is the proposed

Hon. Mr. BOUFFARD: The limit of a
peisonal boan iýs $1,000, and the bank cannot
invest in sucli securities more thon 5 per cent
of the total amount of its deposits.
Hon. Mr. LEGER: That is a variation fron
the Bank Act.
Hon. Mr. BOUFFARD: It is. These two
institutions are not commercial banks at ail;
they are -patronized oniy by small deposîtors.
Some of these peopie, once or twice i.n the
course of their lives, need to borrow funds
for a special purpose. At the present time
the bank is unable to serve them.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Wiil the honourable
gentleman permit me to ask two more quesWlîat wiil ho the rate of interest
tions?
ciîarged by the banks on personal boans?
Hon. Mr. BOUFFARD: Not more than 6
per cent.
11
Hon. Mr. HAIG: How much wi the hanks
ho able to lend on reai estate?

Hon. Mr. BOUFFARD: Up to 60 per cent
of the value of the reai estate.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: At wlîat rate of interest?
Hon. Mr. BOUFFARD: The maximum rate
is 6 per cent.
As i.ndicated in the answers that 1 have made
to questions, the proposed additional powers
are very limited. First of ail, a bank cannot
iend more than 5 per cent of its total deposits
on eitiier mortgages or personal loans; that is,
altogether not more than 10 per cent of its
total deposits on these forms of boans. Secondly,
the maximum rate of interest chargeable by
the bank is 6 per cent. Furthermore, real
estate býans may be made only on i.mproved
property, not on vacant land, and the limit of
any boan is 60 per cent of the value of the
property. Also, no boan can be made on first
mortgage security until approved by the board
of directors.
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: The honourable
gentleman means 60 per cent of the municipal
valuation?
Hon. Mr. BOUFFARD: No, 60 per cent of
the real value. It is the same limitation as
applies to trust companies.
Hon. Mr. QUINN: That is 60 per cent of thie
appraised value?
Hon. Mr. BOUFFARD: Yes.
Hon. Mr. LEGER: Are the banks managed
by a board of directors?

JUNE 15, 1948
'Hon. Mr. BOUFFARD: Yes. There are
ten directors for the bank in Quebec city and
twelve for the bank in Montreal. They are
ail outstanding men.
Hon. Mr. LEGER: How are they appointed?
lion. Mr. BOUFFARD: They are appointed
by the shareholders, the same as lu auy other
bank or company.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: What is the issued capital
stock?
Hon. Mr. BOUFFARD: The capital stock

of The Quebec Savings Bank is $1,000,000, aud
that of the Montreal City and District Savings
Bank ie at lest $2,000,000-1 arn toýld it is
$3,000,000.
The purpose of the bill is to permit these
banks to give better service to their clients,
wbo do busi.nezs with them rather than witb
the commercial banks.
These banks have been limited in their
investments, and they now require a botter
interest return on their money. At the present time this amounts to not more than 3
per cent, 2 per cent of which they pay to
their depositors. It is therefore necessary
that they secure additional revenue from some
source in order to carry on their business and
provide services similar to those offered by
other financial institutions.
As I have already stated, the Quebec Savings
Bank bas only fourteen branches. When a
man enters it-s employ at the age of twen'tyone or twent-y-two, he expects to etay there
for the rest of hie lîfe. With so few branches,
promotion is naturally rather slow. It is
necessary therefore, for the bank to pay its
employees according to age and responsibilities rather than the positions they hold. To
keep their employees happy both banks hae
bad to meet the current rise in salari es.
This bas bit them quite bard. ýConsequently,
they require additional revenue.
The bill con tains some minor amendmente
to bring tbe Act into line witb the Incorne
Tax Act and the Bank Act, and certain provisions relating to incarne and investment
returni.
Wben the bill bas received second reading,
I intend to aek -that it be referred to the
Banking aud
on
Committee
Standing
Commerce.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: May I ask one furtber
question? How mucb mouey is on deposit in the
banks?
Hon. Mr. BOUFFARD: In the Quebec
Savings Bank there je approximately 821,000,000
on deposit; the amount in the Moutreal
City and District Savings Bank le approximately $50,000,000.

-565

Hon. Mr. GOUIN.- May I say that it is
eometbing like $138 million?
Hon. Mr. BOUFFARD: The bonourable
senator from De Salaberry (Hon. Mr. Gouin)
is more familiar witb the Moutreal bauk than
I arn.
Hon. CYRILLE VAILLANCOURT (Translation) : Honourable senators,. I take pleasure
in supporting the bll moved by my bonourable
friend from Grandville (Hon. Mr. Bouffard)
regarding the Quebec Savings Bank and the
Montreal City and District Savings Bank.
With the Quebec Savinge Bank, we shall now
have three organizations whose abject je to
help our low-income people by granting tbem
boans out of their own savings.
Let us not forget that wben the Quebec
Savings Bank and the Montreal City and
District Savinge Bank were organized by the
directors of the St. Vincent de Paul Society,
the intention was to belp people of emal
meane. As 1-ery little epeculation is carried ou
among the depositors of those banke, the latter
feel no inclination to lend millions of dollars,
even to their depositors; therefore, there can
be no fear of buge losses.
I am happy to find today that both bance,
after having been in operation for a buudred
years, realize that they can belp their smal
depositors rather than use their depoeits to
favour large organizations.
It le a wonderful departure, and one whicb
is in the best interest of our working classes.
Co-operation je always a good thing. In future,
the People'e Banks, the Quebec Savings Bauk
aud tbe Montreal City aud District Savings
Bank will be able together to render a greater
service to the people lu the lower salary
brackets and to the boneet workingmeu of our
country..
The motion was agreed to aud the bill was
rend the second time.
REYERRED TO COMMITTEE
Hou. Mr. ROBERTSON moved that the bill
be referred to the Standing Committee ou
Banking sud Commerce.
The motion was agreed to.
SASKATCHEWAN NATURAL
REOURCES BILL
SECOND READING
Hou. WISHART MeL. ROBERTSON
moved the second reading of Bill Z-1l, an Act
to amend the Saskatchewan Natural Resourcea
Act.
He eaid: Houourable seustors, the purpose
of this bill je Vo confirrn au agreement dated
May 28, 1948, betweeu the Goverumnent of

SENATE
Canada and the Government of Saskatchewan,
to enable the latter to seli scho.ol lands f0
veterans without being subject to the restriction imp.osed by section 38 of the Dominion
Lands Act, which requires sale by public
auction.
When control of Saskatchewan's
natural resources was transferred in 1930 from
the Dominion to the province, it was provided
that school lands so transferred should be
administered in accordance with sections 37 to
40 of tbe Dominion Lands Act. This meant
that as a precaution against fraudulent practices, school lands could be sold only by public
auction.
Following the recent war the provincial
authorîties, in co-operation with the federal
Departnment of Veterans Affairs, adopted a plan
for the settiement of veterans on school lands
on a lease-option basis. A veteran may eure
a Icase of and an option to purchase land
on undertaking to, apply, over a period of
years, a share of bis crop towards payment of
thle purchase price. The plan is endorsed by
both tbe provincial and federal authorities, but
tcchnically it is incompatible witb tbe provision of the 1930 agreement that these school
lands can be sold only by public auction.
The agreement wbich parliament is now
asked to confirni will remove any legal doubts
about the transactions. It is expected that
the province will pass concurrent legislation
at the first opportunity; meanwhilc, confirmation of the agreement by the Dominion Parliament will make it easier for the Department

of Veterans Affairs to, approve the granting of
various rehabilitation benefits to the veterans
woarc settled on these lands and are beginning farming operations.

lion. Mr. HAIG: 1 do flot object at ail to
this hill. My honourablo friend bas said tbat
the purpose of it is to remove a legal doubt.

There is no legal douht about it: a veteran
cannot acquire school land unless the statutory rcquirement tliot it be sold by public
auction is comiplicd with. What the bill does
is tu put tindcr tli, control of the provincial
governiment certain lands which otherwise
would be sold at auction for school purposes.
I find nothing in the bill to indicate the
destination of the money resulting from the
sale of these lands to veterans. Recalling that
in Manitoba we bujît up quite a large fond
by the sale of public lands, and ühat Saskatchewvan accuniulatcd a much larger fund,
I have wondercd what is the intention in this
respect. Thercfore 1 ask what is to hecome
of the~ ronev obtained for these lands? Certainly 1 have no objection f0 ex-soldiers getting
the henefit of p'îrchasing tbem, but the money
should go, not to the province of Saskatchewan, but to the school laind fiinds.

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: While I assume
that tbe funds will continue te be assigned to,
the purpose indieated in the Dominion Lands
Act, I arn not at the moment in a position

definitely to say so. If the bouse sees fit to
give tbe bill second reading, I intend to move
that it be referred to tbe Standing Committee
on Natural Resources, where points sueh as
the honourable senator has raised can be deaIt
with.

The motion wa-s agrecd to, and ftic bill was

BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON moved tbe second
reading of Bill 339, an Act to amend an Act
res.pecting the National Battlefields at, Quebec.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Carried.

Hon. Mr. HAIG:

What is the explanation

of the bill?

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I have asked tbe
honourable senator from Grandville
Mr. BoulTard) to explain this bill.

(Hon.

Hon. P. H. BOUFFARD: If the Senate
wishes to approve of the bill witbout any
explanation, 1 arn content.
lion. Mr. HAIG: I want an explanation.
That is vihat I was asking for.
Houi. Mr. BOUFFARD: Tbe hill is a very
simple one.
If authorizes the Minister of
Finance to psy out of the consolidated revenue
of Canada Vo, the National Battlefields Coinmission the surn of $100,000 for eacli of ten
Ycars, commencing April 1, 1948. Une of its

commission, which for this purpose requires
the special authorization of parhiament, to,
acquire a new piece of propcrty at the foot of
the hli known as Gilmour Hill, and situate
between thc old and the ncw Cbarnplain Roads.
1V is in the cadastre of the Parish of Sýt.
Colombe de Sillery. Tbe land is te be acquired
by the BaVtlecfi'elds Commission for tbe purpose
of straightening a bad curve in the road lead.
ing eut of the park.

JUNE 15, 1948
Tbe carrying out af this project will not
cost thie government anything, because the
land will be acquircd irom the National ilarbours Board. Tbe anly expense will be for
the preperatian af deed.s- of sale between the
board and tbe commission.
Hon. Mr. LEGER: Is this the Valcartier
Park?
Hon. Mr. BOUFFARD: No, it is the Battlefields Park. As the bonourable senetar probably knows, it extends from tbe prison in
Quebec along Grande Allée as far as the cîiff,
and also in the direction ai Ste. Foy. The
pai k was establisbed in 1908 in commemoration ai two battles-one in 1759-on the Plains
of Abrabam, and the second in 1760 et Ste.
Foy-tbe government and tbe people ai Quebec
subscribing an amaunt in excess af 8450,000
ta provide for the celebration af the tercentenary af Quebec and ta acquire praperty for
tbe purpose of establishing the park and preserving tbis historie site. From 1912 ta 1928
the govcrnment made an annual grant. From
1928 for ten canzecutive years grante ai $75,000
were voted annually by parli.ament. From 1938
ta 1948 a similar grant was made by the
government. The commission now neede
$100.000 a year for the preservation and adequate upkeep ai the park, and the present
bill provides for a grant af $100,000 a year
during the next ten years.
Through tbe grants already receivcd, one af
the most magnificent park areas i Canada bas
been establisbed on Grande Allée and on the
Battlefields. The park je a source ai enjoyment nat only ta tbe local population but ta
aîl wbo visit Quebec. Tbere je not an American who cames ta tbat city but goes into tbe
park ta enjoy the beauty ai tbe place. It je
situeted approximately 300 feet above the level
ai the St. Lawrence, and overloake nat only
tbet river but also the wbole city ai Levis, the
Quebec Bridge, and the bille on tbe soutb shore
ai tbe river. It je really one ai the most wondcrful sites in Canada; and we are especially
grateful ta the gavernment for baving made it
possible ta preserve a place witb sucb historic
associations and make it one ai the fineet, if
not the fineet park in Canada.
Bearing in mind the amount required for
salaries ai employeee and the materials necessary ta properly maintain tbe park, the sum
provided for je nat exorbitant. The work wbicb
bas already been done is extremely satisfactary
ta everyane; and I repeat that the government deserves ta be comphimented for baving
kept the place in such good condition. Every
day bundreds af cbildren are ta be seen playi.ng in the park; and automobiles on the roade
5853-38

567

ai the park stop ta let their occupants admire
the sigbt before them.
There are only two recommendations that
I should like ta make. First, that the military
barracks erected in the park during the war
be removed. They detract from the beauty
of that section of the park in which they are
located. At tîmes conditions have been so
bad that the authorities have had to close
certain roade ta prevent outsiders from going
through that area. The removal of these
military barracks, when the government is
able to get rid of them, will greatly enhance
the pleasure of the citizens of Quebec and, I
arn sure, ai ail who visit the park in the
summertime.
My second recommendation ie that the
prison also sbould be removed. A park is a
place for enjoyment, and the sooner the site
af the prison is changed ta same other place,
the better. In ail other ways the government
has done marvelously well. I understand that
up ta now it bas been impossible to get rid of
the military barracks. wbicb are stili occupied,
or ta construct another prison. Howcver, I arn
sure that when these buildings are removed
tbe park will be so improved that it will be
the fineet in Quebec if not in ail Canada.
Honaurable senators, if this bill is given
second reading, 1 would suggest that it 'be
referred ta the Standing Committee on Natural
Resources, wbere its details could be discussed.
Hon. JOHN T. HAIG: Honourable senators,
1 arn very glad ta support this bill because I
believe that in the past we bave done too littie
for aur national parks.
I migbt suggest ta the leader of the government that, if be thinks there mey be difficulty
in getting a bill througb. this house, he had
better engsge tbe services af the honourable
senator front Grandville. I arn not et ail surprised that be was elected Bâtonnier of tbe
province ai Quebec. If I were apposing this
bill, I would rather bave anyone else than my
friend from Grandville piloting it. I do nùt
think it is necessary ta, send the bill ta
committee.
Tbrough the years everyone in this bouse
bas heen in favour of maintaining and improving Canada's splendid park system. The only
criticism I cen offer is that the government bas
failed ta plan a system ai super-higbways and
connecting roads across Csnada ta accommodate more tourist trafflc. Canada bas not paid
enough attention to, its roads. I amn tbinking
not only of the maney that touriste may bring
into aur country, but of the iect that tbere is
a great free nation ta the soutb af us, and that
nobody is mnore bound up witb tbem tban we
Canadians are. We like the Ameri(ans and

SENATE

they like us. Some of us may have rows with
tbern, but only as individuals.
Starting with Sjr Wilfrid Laurier, the Governiment of Canada bas always spent rnoney on
the deve]oprnent of national parks. In rny own
province there is a rnost delightful park, a place
of beauty and recreation, as are the national
parks in every province; but if super-highways
were bouit across Canada more tourists would
travel tbrough our country and spend t eir
vacations here. We in Ottawa see a goo deal
of tourist traffic frorn across the border. The
roads are fairly good frorn Montreal or
Toronto.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: Not frorn Montreal
to Ottawa. That is the worst road in the
world.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I admit that it is flot the
best.
Hon. Mr. COPP: They corne that way after
visiting their homes in the Maritime Provinces.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Perbaps tbey do; but the
people I meet in the Ottawa, hotels aIl corne
by way of Montreal or Toronto, and they get
here as quickly as they can. After bearing the
election resuits in Toronto the other day they
did flot stop at ail, but carne rigbt througb frorn
that city.
Honourable senators, I want to support this
bill and urge the goverinent to take a broader
view of the benefit derived from tourist traffic
in Canada. 1 know that our tourist accormnnodation can be criticized, but what stands out
most in the mind of every American tourist
is the condition of the roads upon wbich hie
has to travel. I do flot tbink the provinces
themselves have sufficient tax resources to
enable thern to do a proper job of building
highiways. A splendid road is being built frorn
southern Manitoba to Winnipeg, but it will
terminate in that city; and except for local
inhabitants no one will ever see our national
park. I did not know there were so many cars
and trucks in the world as I saw in Saskatchewan, covered with snow, when I passed
thiough that province la.st Marcb. These
veliceles wcre tied up during Marcb, and
rernained there until rny honourable friend
frorn Rosetoxxn (Hon. Mr. Aseltine) wvent borne
around the first of May and duig themn out.
Canada sbould take a greater interest in the
condition of ber roads. We hear talk about
the $280 million that we derive from Amenican tourist traffle. But I do flot believe wve
get it. If we biad good roads throughout this
country, tourists would be encouraged to take
short trips through the Maritirne Provinces
before returning to the United States, or to
corne tup frorn the central .states into the
prairie provinces and British Columbia, and
t.his traffic would mean much to Canada.

Honourabie senators, I think this bill is
along the right lines, and I heartily support it.
Hon. FELIX P. QUINN:
Honourable
senators, I offer no objection to this bill. I
eongratulate tbe mernbers from Quebec upon
being able to secure iegislation wbereby they
receive the sum of $1 million for the improvement of the battlefield at Quebec. I would
point out in contrast the treatrnent meted out
to the city of Halifax. Year after year requests
have been made to the goverrnent for sorne
consideration, such as a rnoney grant, so that
the o!d Citadel
lI
could be repaired and
îrnproved.

Hon. Mr. DUFF: He-ar, hear.
Hon. Mr. QUINN: H-onourable senators
know that the Citadel was built by the Duke
of Kent, the father -of Queen Victoria, when be
wvas Commander in Chief of the British Forces
in North America. It is a beautiful site. Those
wbo are familiar with Halifax know that Fort
Edward is an eight-sided structure, situnted on
the top of a hill in the centre of the city. It
is a disgraee to the -Dominion Governrnent,
which owns it, that the Citadel Hill bas fallen
into disrepair. If the building and the retaining wall about the rnoat could be repaired, the
place would be n wonderful attraction to tourist.s. As my hionourable friend from Lunenburg (Hon. Mr. Duif) can tell you, there is a
beautiful drive around this bill, leading into
the old fort.
I might also refer to the oîd Martello tower
in Point Pleasant park at Halifax.
Time
after timp requests have been rnade to the
govc.rrnent te preserve this tower, but it has
got into sucb a bad state by now that I suppose it is beyond repair.
As I said at the outset, honourable senators I sirnply ivanted to contrast tbe treatment accorded to tbe city of Quebec with
t iat rneted out to Halifax.
lion. Mr. ROBERTSON: Honourable senators, wbetber or flot the government bas
responded to the particular requests mentioned by rny honourable friend who shares
-with me the privilege of representing bere the
beauitiful village of Bedford, in the province
of Nova Scotia. I sbould like to make it dlean
that contributions, and extensive ones, have
been made to national parks in that province.
I arn not famillar with tbe national parks in
Queber, but. in order that the bouse may flot
recepive an erroneous impression, I wouîd
point out that large surns bave been expended
by the federal governrnent on tbe Cape
Breton Highlands park, the Champlain Habitation at Port Royal, and Fort Anne park at
Annapolis Royal three specifie instances in

5M9

JUNE 15, 1948
Nova Scotia to wbicb my honourable friend
neglected to refer.
An Hon. SENATOR: And Louisbourg.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Yes, the Fortress
of Louisbourg.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the second time.
YUKON BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON moved the second
reading of Bill 341, an Act to amend the
Yukon Act.
He said: Honourable senators, in echoing
the sentiment expressed by the honourable
leader of the opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig)
when he referred to the peculiar persuasiveness of those whom I, from time to time ask
to explain bis, I may say that I am
embarrassed by the wealtb of riches available
to me in this respect. I now propose to ask
the honourable gentleman from Toronto
(Hon. Mr. Hayden) to employ bis "peculiar
persuasiveness" in explaining this bill.
Hon. SALTER A. HAYDEN: Honourable
senators. the Committee on Natural Resources
has had before it for some time the Yukon
Placer Mining and Yukon Quartz Mining bis,
but bas witbbeld action on tbem wbile awaiting this bill, which contains amendments to
the main Act. The amendments in tbis bill,
whicb tics in witb the others, are of a minor
character, and are designed to make administration in the Yukon uniform witb that in the
Northwest Territories.
In 1918 tbe cbief executive officer of the
Yukon Territory was designated as the Comptroller, and in hlm was vested tbe powers bcld
iup to that time by tbe Commissioner and bis
deputy, the Administrator, wbose positions
Now it is proposed to
were abolisbed.
re-cstablish those positions and tities. I was
almost going to suggest that the Administrator, being the deputy of the Commissioner.
mighit be described as the Vice-Commissioner,
but that migbt lead to some confusion.
Thcn there is a provision for increasing the
sessional indemnity of cacb member of the
Yukon Council to an amount not exceeding
$1,000. The prescrnt indemnity is "a sum not
to exceed $4002" The bill also provides that
members may be paid travelling and living
expenses whiie the council is in session.
There is in tbe Yukon an officiai known as
the Public Administrator, and tbe Act requires
that he be a barrister of at least five years'
standing at the bar of any of the provinces.
The remuneration attached ta the post bas
.5853-381

made it difficuit to obtain an official witb this
qualification, and the bill provides simpiy that
thbe person appointed shail be "a barrister or
advocate at the bar of any of the provinces"
Another amendment wouid make hoiograph
willq legal in the Yukon.
The bill would aiso repeal section 118 of thepresent Act. That section, wben read in conjunction witb the Criminai Code, created
some confusion as to wbether in criminal
cases the court of appeai for tbe Yukon Territory was a provincial court or the Supreine
Court of Canada. If section 118 is repealed
there will be no doubt that the appeal court
in sncbi cases is the Court of Appeal of
Britisb Columbia.
Then there is an amendmnent with respect to
tbe importation of liquor into the Yukon.
Heretofore no liquor couid be i.mported into
the territory except by permission of the
Governor in Council. The principal importer
of liquor into the territory is the government,
wbîch maintains its own liquor stores; and it
is now proposed ta substitute the Commissioner for the Governor in Council.
lion. Mr. HAIG: Why?
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: For uniformity ini
practice. I understand that that is the practice in the Northwest Territories.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I did not know that there
was an elected council in the Northwest Territories.
Hon. Mr. HAYIYEN: Well, at Yellowknife
tbey have an administrative counicil.
If second reading is given, I saal move for
reference to tbe Standing Committee on
Natural Resources, in order tbat the bill ma$v
be considered there along with the two others
that I have mentioned.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill waa
read the second time.

Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: This session the

than usual. It started in January, and sat

I take this opportunity to thank the various

to tbank the reporting staff, who worked weekends to belp us, and Mr. Hinds and his very

As this work rnay again be assigned to the

government that we are very badly in need
of another lawyer.
Hon. Mr. HAI'G: On the committee.
Hon. Mr. A-SELTINE: On the committee,
yes. Sometimes it is difficuit for the senator
from Winnipeg (Hon. Mr. Haig), the senator
from Westmorland (Hon. Mr. Copp), and
myseif to be present on tbe same day. This
is essential in order that the work may be
divided; otherwise it would flot be possible
to hear thirteen or fourteen cases in a day.
It would be a good thing if the additîonal
lawyer-member of the committee came from
Western Canada or from the far East, because
honourable senators who reside in Ontario and
Quebec frequently desert us over the weekend.
Last year I made quite a comprehensive
report, and while I do not intend to report at

lengtb this year, I have some information
which 1 tbink honourable senators will find
interesting. 1 have obtained from the Bureau
of Statisties the following table of divorces

Hon. Mr. DUPUIS: Has tbe honourable
gentleman the percentages relative to population?
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: Oh, well, we ail
know that altbough the population of Quebec
is about one-third the total population of the
Dominion the number of divorces in that
province is not large: last year it was only
290.
Hon. Mr. DUPUIS: As I arn a citizen of
thlis country, I should like to bave the
picture from Halifax to Vancouver.
Hon. Mr. QUINN: Could the bonourable
senator state the percentage of divorces to
marriages?
.Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: No. I did not ask
the Bureau of Statistica for that information.
Perbaps the Bureau can supply the figures.
There is something else I want to bring to
the attention of honourable senators. Last
year when the committee presented its report
it recommended that parliament should seek a
solution of this divorce problem. As far as I
know, no recommendation of any kind has
been forthcoming, and it looks as thougb the
committee will be obliged 'to function again
next year.
Honourable senators will also remember
that on July 9, 1947, it was agreed, upon
motion of the honourable senator from
Queen's (Hon. Mr. Sinclair):
That the subjeet-matter of the final report
of the Standing Committee on Divorce be referred to the Parliamentary Counsel of the Senate
for consideration and report immediately fol.lowing the opening of the next session of parliament.
Our Parliamentary Counsel took this matter
in hand. After making quite a comprehensive
investigation he bas produced a four-page
report. I believe honourable senators will
find it interesting. 1 do not intend to read
it ail. Counsel deals first witb the recom.-

I was interested in thc last of these proposais.
lie states:
Another proposai whieh bas been urged by
some wrjters is the establishment of a new
divorce court for the Dominion hax ing exclusive jurisdiction in matters of marriage and
divorce.
That is an idea which honourable senators
miglit censider between now and the next
session cf parliament. Quite properl.y,, counsel
makes ne recommendation, for the matter is
one for parliament itself to determine.
Hon. Mr. MORAUD: Dees the lienourable

Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: This is my fifteenth

about this problem for a long time, and 'I have

that the committee sheuld net ho called upon

WISHART MeL. ROBERTSON:
lionourahle senators, I arn net in a pesitien te

of the suggestions made by the lionourabie the
('hiirman of the Committee on Diverce. I de
think, liowxever, that any recemmendýatiens
made liy hima sliould receive rnest caretul
consideration.
In my official capacity as gevernment leader
in this bouse it is my duty frern time te time
tej norninate chairmen and members cf various
cornnittees. I should tlicrefore like to express
mny deep appreciatien-and that, 1 arn sure, of
honourable members cf this bouse-cf the
splendid andl self-sacrificing service rendered
by the honourable Chairman ef the Divorce
Comniittee andi bis a.sscciates in carrying out

are set down in advance and have te lie deait

JUNE 16, 1948
Hon. Mr. ROBERTS ON: In addition to
looking after the responsibilities wbicb are bis
as leader of the opposition, hie has given much
of bis time and energy to assisting his colleague and deskinate, the bonourable senator
from Rosetown (Hon. Mr. Aseltine). At tbe
commencement of each session 1 arn almost
terrified that those who for so many years
have given of their untiring efforts will eall on
me and say, "We have done as mucb as we
should be aýked to do on this committee, and
somebody else bas got to take over the load".
Frankly, I do flot know what I would do in
such circumstances.
It appears likely that the Senate will be
charged with the responsibility of bearing
divorce cases next: session, and I would urge
that the suggestions made by the bonourable
chairman of the committee be given serious
consideration by every legal member of this
bouse. In conclusion, I again wish to express
to the chairman and members of bis coinmittee ýmy deepest appreciation of their
devotion to duty.
Hon. L. M. GOUIN: Honourable senators,
a1though in principle I am opposed to divorce,
I recog-nize quite willingly the many years of
devotion to duty of the honourable leader of
the opposition and other senators wbo bave
served on our divorce committees. The general
opi,nion expressed in tbe province of Quebec
bas been in favour of retaining the present
miethod of divorce.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: That is the trouble;
they are too well satisfied.
Hon. Mr. GOUIN: I feel it my duty to
state tbis quite seriously because in the Jesuit's
magazine Relations, for instance, Father
deLery bas written that in bis opinion the
present systemn employed in Quebec divorce
cases is superior to what migbt be described
as the judicial procedure. I do not intend
to enter into any argument concerning this
controversial matter; but wben a theologian
wbo is abzolutely- opposed to divorce makes
sucb a statement, I tbink it is a higb compliment to the system now in effect.
Gencrally speaking, in Quebec there bas
always been opposition to a judicial procedure,
because in that province we do not recognize
divorce as a rigbt. Parliament, by reason of
being in a sense all-powerful, can, if it deems

fit, grant relief in special cases tbrougb tbe
med'ium of a private bill; but to> set up a
code of procedure for Quebec would be to
establisb what we caîl a legal rigbt. I believe
a full study of tbe present situation would be
welcomed. I thin-k we all admit tbat there
are social conditions wbicb are exceedingly
serious and that ail Christian citizens-we all

do our best to be good Canadians and good
Christians--are of opinion tbat tbis serious
problem deserves just as careful researchi as,
for instance, the dread disease of cancer. It is
only at the end of the session of parliament,
wben it is too late to do anytbing, that thîs
problem is mentioned, and I for one would be
exceedingly glad if, during tbe course of tbe
next session, we were ta bave an opportunity to,
give more than passing attention to tbis matter.
Hon. J. J. DUFFUS: Honourable senators,
in prcsenting bis report, tbe Chairman of tbe
Divorce Committee (Hon. Mr. Aseltine)
pointed out that the parliamentary

fees are

remitted te some people, and he specifically
used the phrase, "such as waitresses".

I think

it would be well to have that strieken fromn
the report.

Hon. JOHN T. HAIG: ilonourable senators. I wish first to congratulate the chairman
of the Committee on Divorce. Also I sbould
like to say that during my eleven years on the
committee my associations with its members
have neyer been more pleasant than during
this session. I cannot recaîl a single case in

which there was any violent difference

of

opinion amýong us. We had our differences, of
course, but we discussed them and arrived at
agreement. I servcd as chairman of the subcommittee twenty-eight days, always witb two
and sometimes with tbree otber members, and

1 take this opportunity of thanking them for
the way in whicb they co-operated.
I also desire to thank the leader of the
government (Hon. Mr. Robertson) for. bis
co-operation. The committee sat frequently
on Friday, Saturday and Monday, and once
in a while the leader would notify me of bis
intention to suggest that the Senate sit on
Monday evening, in order to bave at least
a quorum of members present for a comnmittee other than the Divorce Committee on
Tuesday morning. When I pointed out to
bim that the Divorce Committee wvas meeting
on Tuesday. lie uisually decided that tbe other
committee could wait until tbe next day.
Frankly, bonourable senators, I tbink more
of our colleagues from Ontario and Quebec
sbould be members of this committee. 0f
course, my remarks do not apply to anyone
wbo bas religious seruples against divorce.
The committee sbould include especially some
of our Ontario members who belong to tbe
legal profession. 1 do not say that a lawyer
is a better judge of evîdence tban a layman
is, but a lawyer is familiar with legal procedure and knows wbat evidence is admissible.
Personally, 1 would rather have laymen than
lawyers witb me on tbe subcomm.ittee, becauze
tbe laymen act as a jury. For instance, the

SENATE

other day at the end of one case I turned to
the gentleman on rny right and asked, "What
do you think about the evidence?"
Ho
summcd it uip briefly, and said ho did flot
think it was sufficient to warrant a divorce.
I then asked the saine question of the gentleman on nîy left, and ho made a similar reply.
So we did flot recommond a divorce in that
case.
The saine thing occurred in another
case: it 'vas the subeommittce that rejected
the two, applications. For jury purposes laymen are as good as or even botter than
lawyers. because the lay mind does not get
tangled up with legal problems;- but the
chairmen of the committee aiid the subcommitteo should be iawyers.
There are various duties attaching to my
position herp, and somne of my colleagues on
this side of the bouse strongly criticize me for
putting in se much time on the Divorce Comnmittee. But, really. whon you have worked
on that commnittee for a while and seen what
heart-burnings are revealed there, you realize
how important the work is and what a tremondous problem we are faced with. I amn
unable to suggest how to solve the problom,
though I believe it is largely caused by conditions in the home. If, instead of simply
denouncing divorce, ministers -of ail denominations were to study its cause and try te
devise some remedies, the number of cases
might decline.
My honourable friend from Peterborough
W"est (Hon. Mr. Duffus) criticized the referThe chairman simply
once to waitresses.
rnentioned thora as being among the lowincome group for whorn, in many cases, we
have recomoended a remission of part of the
parliamentary fees. And I would point out
to my honourable friond fcomn Provenchor
(Hon. Mr. Beaubien) that wben there is a
remission of focs 10 a petitioner the lawver's
tariff of charges is reducod.
Hon. A. L. BEAUBIEN: In proportion

Hon. Mr. HAIG: Yes.
Hon. Mr'. SINCLAIR: The cases of many
of the peorer applicants were sponsored by
welfare ass~ociations.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE:

And some by the

Hon. Mr. HAIG: Yes, different organizations
brougýht them f orward. I suggested that a few
of our legal members from Ontario should ho
,on the eommittee. I sh'ould aiso like te see
several Quebec lawyers included. Why should
they flot stay heue from Friday te Monday
and make it a littho casier for the rest of us?

It seems to me that any senator wh*o served
on the Divorce Committee on Fridays, Saturdays and Mondays, when the Sonate itself was
not sitting, should nlot be penalized if by
chance bie bas been absent from Senate sittings
a day or two more than the fifteon allowed te
him.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. HIAIG: I nsyself amn ot affected,
for so far this session I bave lost only one day
-though perhaps I may lose anether tomnorrow. My bonourable friýend from Rogetown
(Hon. Mr. Aseltine) bas presided over the
Divorce Committee thirty-one dnys when the
Sonate itself wsxa not sitting, yet bocause the
number of sitting days that hie missed was two
or three in *oxcess ef fifteen ho will nlot get bis
full indernnity. I tbink that next session we
should consider amending our rules so as to
allow a few extra davs' absence to members
%Vho have sorved faithfully -on the Divorce
Committee.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, bear.
Hon. R. B. HORNER: Honourable senators,
I býeliex e there would ho fewer divorces in
Canada if we followed the example of some
of the eIder countries wbere the marriage
match is, made by the parents of the young
couple. If we eould get that idea accepted bere
we would do something really worthwhile.
Everybody seems te think that the man should
propose to the woman, but il appears that our
mon bave fallen down -on the job.
Hon. Mr. MARCOTTE: Honourable senators, I do net think any barma would be done
if the discussion of this report were delayed for
two or three days, se that we may bave a
chance te .see the opinion of Parliamentary
Counsel, as placed on the record.
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: That is net part of
tise committee's report.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: No, it is flot; I
simply put it in during my remarks. H*owever,
I have ne objection teo the request *of my
bonourable friend from Ponteix (Hon. Mr.

Hon. J. J. KINLEY: Honourabie senators,
1 move:
That the said report be not concurred in,
but that the amendments made by the House of
Commons to the bill be referred to a Committee
oif the Whole forthwith for further consideration.
The motion was agreed to, and the Senate
went into committee.
Hon. Mr. Sinclair in the Chair.
On buse of Communs Amendment No. 1
(page 3, line 7) :Hon. Mr. KINLEY: Honourable senators,
I now desire to move:
That the said amendment be not concurred
iu but that it be amended by striking out the
words "solely employed in fishing not exceeding
one hundred and fifty tons," and substituting
therefor the words "principally employed in
fishing not exceeding two hundred tons".
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: Are we now considering the definition of a sailing ship?
Hon. Mr. KINLEY: Yes. Insufficient reason
has been advanced for changing 'the original
proiision. The amendment made by the
House of Communs seeks to limit the definitien of a saiiing ship. Such a limitation wouid
be a hindrance to the traffic of small vesseis in
minor and coastal waters.
This bill is unique. It w.as introduced in the
Senate, and in its passage through this house
section 89 was agreed te. This defined a sailing
ship as a vessel propel!led by sail only. Any
reference to vesseis with auxiiiary power was
deleted £rom the A.et. The bill went to the
House of Communs, where the original definition was partially restored by the following
amendment:
"Saiiing ship", except for the purposes of
the Load Lines Rules, means a ship prupelled
wholly by sails, and a ehip solely employed in
fishing flot exceeding une hundred and fifty
tons, gross tonnage, provided with masts, sails
and rigging sufficient ta allow ber to make voyages tînder ssiI alone, and that, in addition, is
fitted with mechanical means of propulsion other
than a steam engine.
On the Atlantic coast, and I believe un the
Pacific coast as *well, vessels exnpioyed in
fighing are also used to convey produce ta
market and ta carry other traffle along the
coast. It was felt that the omission of auxiliary
vessele from the definition of a sailing éhip
was too drastic.
The amendment by the House of Communs
to Section 89 uses these words:
... a ship solely employed in fishing not exceeding une hundred and f.fty tons.
Theuamendment now proposed reads:
:..principally employed in 6ishing nut exceeding two hundred tons.

vicinity. To get oil from the Norman Wells,
barges would have to go upstreamn 200 miles,
and.as oil is a heavy commodity the cost would
be too great. Engineers ail agree, therefore,
that hydro-electrie power is the solution to
the problem.
lIn 1946 the Dominion Government votcd
money to establish the Snare River Storage and
Power Company plant, which is approximately
ninety-four miles fromn the town of Yellowknife. It will commence operations this fal
and will supply power to the town of Yellowknif e and to neighbouring mines. Its initial
capacity will be approximately 8,000 horsepower, and 4,000 horsepower have already been
contracted for. Ail the structures are to be
but on a self-sustaining and self-liquidating
basis. By charging 1-73 cents per kilowatt
hour. the Snare River plant will be selfliquidating even when sellinig 4,000 horsepower.
lIt is estimated that the cost, if the plant were
to be operated with fuel oil, would be about
à cents per kilowatt hour. The Con mine
produces about 4,000 horsepower.
It is expected that the costs whi.ch are being
advanced by the Dominion Goverament will
ahl be regained. It is estimated that the amount
of ore available at the Snare River is sufficient
to last for flfteen years.

The costs, i.ncluding

maintenance, transmission lines, salaries, travelling expenses, and contingency reserve. will he
estimated and amortized on a fifteen-ycar basis,

so that the rates charged wl.ll cover the entire
costs during

that time.

The

rates will he

reviewed ýfrequently, and as more power is
used the costs will be reduced. This policy
will be followed in any new plant that may

be established.

and to develop and operate other plants that
may be established as the need arises. Power
can be economically transmitted for a distance
of approximately 100 miles, and it is hoped
that snîaller mining companies, which May not
wish to finance a power plant, will be encouraged to develop when they know that power
can be purchased fromn the large plants at a
relatively cheap rate.
The commission will consist of a chairmannow a member of the department--and two
other commissioners to be appointed by the
Governor in Council. The commissioners and
the permanent employees will come under the
Civil Service Superannuatiýon scheme. AI]
the other employees; will corne under the
Workmen's Compensation and Unemployment
Insuîrane sc'hemps and will reive medical,
hospîtal and first-aid services. The commission
will be the agent of His Majesty, and as such

579

will be able to enter into contracts and to
acquire and hold property. The commission
can sue and be sued without a fiat being
obtaineci from the government. The minister
very definitely stated that that was his
intention.
The work of the commission will be to
manage the Snare River plant and to survey
and investigate the possibility of establishing new power plants. The commission may
not undertake or enter into a contract involving a total cstimated expenditure of more than
$50,00)0 without first sccuring the approval of
the Governor in Council. The commission,
under the Expropriation Act, can expropriate
territories required for their particular work.
Anyone with a dlaim ag-ainst the commission
can have his case heard by the Exehequer
Court of Canada.
The commission will selI the power in
blocks to minîng companies and to consumers.
A little less than 41 million has already been
,Spent on the Snare River plant. This is to be
charged against the commission, which will
have to arrange the amortization, of that
ar ont.
The Yellowknif e territory, being close to
the land of the midnight sun, bas fromn twenty
to twenty-two hours of daylight during part
of the year. As it sometimes may be necessary to carry out work in that particular
period, and hpfore parliament can vote
moncys, provision is .made to, enable the

Minister of Finance to advance fromn the
Consolid-atcd Revenue Fund certain sums of
money, not exoecding $1,000,000, during that
particular season. At the end of each year
the commission must prepare a financial statement showing the moneys expended and have
it placed before parliament during the first

fifteen days of the next session of parhiament.
Honourable senators, the purpose of establishing this commission is toý further develop
our resources without cost to the taxpayers.

1 hope the Senate will approve of the bill
and give it second reading.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the second time.
THIRD

READING

The Hon. the SPEAKER: When shaîl this
bill be read a third time?

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON- Honourable senators, whether this bihl should be referred to
committee or not-

Hon. Mr. HAIG: Give it third reading now.
Hon. Mr. LEGER: Honourable senators, I
should hike to kn.ow how many commissioners

SENATE

wil-l be appointed under this bill. Subsection
(2) of section 3 rcads as follows:
The commission shall consist of one member
to he appointed by the Governor in Council to
bcechairman, and nlot more than two additiona]
members to he appointed hy the Governor je
Couneil.
1 interpret the last part of that subsection
as purely permissive. The Governor in Council may or may not appoint the two additional
members. My view is strengthened by subsection (7) of the same section, which refers to
the quorum. It says:
Where the membership consists of two> or
three members, two members constitute a
quorum.
It appears that the commission may consist
of one member only, though as many as three
members may be appointed; and whcn there
are two or three members, two will constitute
a quorum. I do flot know that the point is
important, but in my opinion it would hve
been better to state precisely how mny
commissioners are to be appointed.
Hon. Mr. GERSHAW: Honourable senators, I have been. informcd that it is the
intention to appoint a chairman first and, a
littie later, two more members.
Departmental
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON:
officiais who are familiar with this matter will
be presenit at the meeting of the Natural
Resources Committee tomorrow morning. My
bonourable friend cau probably get an answer
to bis question then.
Hon. Mr. LEGER: I arn not asking that
third reading be delayed.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: As my bonourable friend
from L'Acadie bas said, the point hie raises
is not an important one. I should like to sec
the bill passed as soon as possible, because
the mines in the territories are badly in need
of electrical power.
Hon. Mr. LEGER: 1 bave no objection to
third reading n0W.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Then I will move
tbat the bill be read the third time.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the third time, and passcd.
CRIMINAL CODE BILL
SECOND RZEADING

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON moved the second
reading of Bill 337, an Act to amend the
Criminal Code.
He said: Honourable senators, I bave asked
the honourahie gentleman from Toronto to
explain this bill.

Hon. SALTER A. HAYDEN: Honourableý
senators, this bill contains forty-five sections,
but tbe ohject of most of thema is to make
clerical corrections or to improve some of the
procedure under the Criminal Code. Seven or
eight sections, however, are important, in that
tbey create new offences or deal with matters
that bave provoked much public interest. 1
shahl refer to these sections briefly, tbough not
in the order of their appearance in ýthe bill.
First 1 caîl attention to section 39, which
nxnends section 888 of the Code. Under section 888 a court in one province cannot try
a person for any offence committed entirely
in anotber province; but tbere is a proviso:
that every proprietor, publisher, editor orother person ehargcd with the publication in a
newspaper of any defamatory libel, shaîl be
deait with, indicted, tried and punished je the
province je whieh hie resides, or je whieh such
newspaper is printed.
The bill broadens tbe proviso to include the
charge of "conspiracy to publish in a newspaper any defamatory libel". This amendment is proposed because of a recent case in
which some persons in Ontario, charged with
conspiracy to publish a defamatory libel
reflecting upon certain public officials in
Alberta, were comrpelîrd to appear for trial
in the latter province.
Another amendment creates a new offence
in the field of murder and rnanslaughter, It
is deflned as "infanticide". This offence bas
been covered by the English criminal haw for
inany years. The amcndment baýs bren recommendcd by the authorities in Canada because
it bas been found almoat impossible to secure
a conviction against a woman charged witb
flic murder of ber newly-born child. No
matter how clear the evidence of guilt may
be, the jury seemi to feel that it would be
uinfair to bring in a verdict implying that the
wornan was wbolly responsible for the crime,
aed usually the trial is ended by the court's
(lecision to arccept a plea o f guilty of concealment of birth and to sentence the accuscd to
a short terni of imprisoniel.
The proposed maximum punishment for a
person found guilty of infanticide is three
vears. On rcading the proposed new subseclion (2) of section 262 of the Code it will be
seen that the ameedment doca not interfere
witli section 19 of the Code, which says that
a person shall not be convicted of an offence
by reason of something that bie did or omitted
to do when suffering from a disease of the
mind.
The proposed new subsection (2)
reads:
A woman w-ho by wilful act or omission causes
the death of ber ncwly-bore child shahl be
d eemed not to have committcd mnurder or manslaughter if at the time of the act or omission

JUNE 16, 1948

she had not f ully recovered from the effect of
giving hirth to sucb child and by reason thereof
the balance of her mind was then distur-bed,
but shahl be deemed to have committed an indictable offence, namely, infanticide.
Hon. Mr. LEGER: Arn I rigbt in thinking
that, regardless of her state of mnd, the
woman would be charged witb infanticide?
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: If the Crown is convinced that at the time of the act she had not
fully recovered from the effect of giving birth
to the cbild, and that the balance of hier mind
was then disturbed, she would be cbarged with
committing infanticide.
Hon. Mr. LEGER: And the subsection
which you read would not be a defence?
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: If she was charged
witb inurder it would be a perfectly good
defence to plead facts to support a charge of
infanticide. Wbat I arn pointing out, however, is that this new subsection does not
interfere with section 19 of the Code, whicli
makes disease of the mind a general defence.
Perhaps I had better read section 19:
No person shall be convicted of an offence by
reason of an act done or omitted by him when
laibouring under natural imbecility, or disease
of the mind, to such an extent as to render him
incapable of appreciating the nature and
quality of the act or omission, and of knowing
that such an act or omission was wrong.
Proof that the accused pcrson came within
that section would be a complete defence.
Hon. Mr. LEGER: But not a defence to
a charge under section 268?
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN,: Section 268 of the
Code establishes an offence even tbougb the
balance of ber mind was disturbed, but it
would not apply if ber mmnd was so deranged
that she, had no appreciation of whnt she was
doing. I arn now pointing out that should
this bill becorne law tbere will then be the
offences of murder. manslaughter and infanticide. Under this bill a wornan cbarged with
murder in the death of bier newly-born child
rnay establish in ber defence sucb facts as
prove the elements of tbe crime -of infanticide,'
and it is for the jury to find wbetber sbe is
guilty of that crime. In other words, tbe
defence under section 19 of the Criminal Code
would be open to bier, and it could be argued
on hier bebaif that sbe was sO completely
derangcd tbat she was net aware of the nature
or quality of the act and did not know tbat
what she was doing was an offence.
Hon. Mr. HITGESSEN: But if sbe were
charged witb infanticide, wbere would tbe
burden of proof lie to show that bier condition
would come witbîn the definition contained in
this particular section of the bill?

Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: If tbe Crown cbarged
hier witb the offence of infanticide, it would
have to prove the facts. An accused person
would eitber bave to admit the facts as
ehar ged or establisb that ber derangemient of
mind wvas so complete as to constitute a
defence under section 19 of tbe Code.
The type of offences created by sections 12,
13 and 14 of tbe bill rnay be described as
fraudulent manipulation of transactions on
the stock exchange and transactions designed
to create in the public mmnd a false appreciatien of value.
These arnendments were
requested by the Attorney-Çleneral of Ontario,
and flow frorn experience gained in the investigation of stock cases under the Securities Act
of that province.
Section 12 of the bill amends section 414 of
the Criminal Code. It bas to do witb the
issuing of a false prospectus, statement or
accounit witb intent te induce people to invest.
In a recent prosedut' on for an offence under
this section the defence establisbed that tbe
accused had not written a false prospectus,
statement or account. On that defence tbe
(barge was dismissed. Tbe amendment proposes tbat section 414 of the Code be amended
by inserting after tbe words "prospectus,
statement or account" the words "wbetber
written or oral".
Frankly, I sbould bave
thougýht those words would be implied by the
section; but since a trial judge bas decided
that a prospectus, staternent or account bas
to be in writing, the department wisbes to
make it quite clear that wbat is complained of
rnay be writtcn or oral. I do not know that
the arnendment cures the defect, but my
fun'ction at this time is merely to explain the
bill.
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN:
Oral prospectus
would seem to be a contradiction of terrms.
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: That is the point I
had in mind.
Section 13 of the bil deals with the wellkn.own section 4,44 of tbe Crirninal Code,
wbich bas to do witb conspiracy to defraud.
The amendment removes the censpiracy provision in section 444 iand makes it dependent
entirely upon section 573, wbich has to do
witb conspiring to commit an indictable
offence. Section 444 bas been repealed, and a
new section is substituted wbich creates tbe
offence of defrauding the public. It is now a
subs.tantive offence rather than an offence of
conspiracy, and tbe penalty bas heen reduced
fromn imprisonnment for seven years te ireprisonmfent for five years. The new section
444 reads:
Every one is guilty of an indictable offence
anid liable te five years' imprisonment who, by

SENATE

deceit or falsehood or other fraudulent means,
defrauds the public or any person, ascertained
or unascertained, or affects the public market
price of stocks, shares, nerchandise, or anything else publicly sold, whether such deceit or
falsehood or other fraudulent means would or
would not amount to a false pretence as hereinbefore defined.

Section 14 of the bill provides a new section
444A, and ereates the offence of fraudulent
manipulations on the stock exchange. This new
section is intended to deal with what is known
as "wash" sales. That is the placing of an order

for the purchase of, say, 10,000 shares of a
certain stock, and at the sarne time placing an
order to sel the sarne number of shares of the
same stock at the purchase price, the purpose
being to create an artificial activity in the
trading of those shares in the market in order
to induce the publie to invest in them. Heretofore the authorities have taken the position
that there was no offence under the criminal
law with which a person so manipulating the
market couild be charged.
Again J say that it is not part of my funetion to say whether the amendment corrects
the problem. The Department of Justice bas
seen fit to accept the recommendation of the
Attorney-General for Ontario and bas included
in the bill this new section 444A, which reads:
Every one is guilty of an indictable offence
and liable to five years' inprisonment who.
through the facility of any stock exchange or
curb market, or other market, with the intent
of creating a false or misleading appearance of
active public trading in any security, or with
the intent of creating a false or misleading appearance with respect to the market price of
any security:
(a) effects any transaction in such security
which involves no change in the beneficial ownership thereof; or

(1b) enters an order for the purchase of such
security with the knowledge that an order of
substantially the saine size at substantially the
sarne time and at substantially the sane price
for the sale of any such security bas been or
will be entered by or for the saie or different
persons;
(c) enters an order for the sale of any such
security with the knowledge that an order of
substantially the sarne size at substantially the
saine time and at substantially the saie price
for the purchase of any such security bas been
o>rwill be entered by or for the sarne or different
persons.
This section of the bill is an attempt to
control the desire for quick profits and to
prevent the deception that may occur on the
stock exchange when someone chooses to
stimulate the market by false transactions for
the purpose of creating public interest in a
certain security. Whether this will prove a
complote remedy I do not know. It is definite
and detailed, and it is framed with the intention of providing further safeguards for the
public.

The next item of importance is an amendment of sections 364 and 365, having to do with
theft from the mails. The present penalty is
three years in jail. The experience of the
Department of Justice in this regard bas been
very unýatisfactory. Judges and magistrates
have taken many and absolutely diverse views
as to the appropriate punishment for theft
fron the mails. Sentences as low as a few
hours, days or weeks have been imposed. If
we are to maintain the almost sacrosanct character of His Majesty's mail and guarantee the
integrity of employees in handling and delivering il. a proper respect must be created, if in
no other way, by the deterrent of a substantial term of imprisonment. The amendment
provides, in case of conviction, for a minimum
sentence of one year.
Section 5 deals with neglect by a man to
supply necessaries to his wife or any child of
his under sixteen years of age. The amendment is necessary because, under section 242
of the Code, a man who deserted his wife but
provided for ber mai.ntenance for the first
montb had complied with the provisions of
the Code, and if thereafter he refused and neglected to maintain ber the Crown could net
prove the commission of an offence. The wording of the relevant paragraph bas now been
changed to make the elements of the offence
desertion and fai.lure to provide necessaries
for any month. Whether this omission is with
lawful excuse becomes a matter of defence
when the Crown bas proved the elements
nece-sary so far as its case is concerned.
Another rather important section to which
I should refer deals with sexual offences, the
frequency of which bas created considerable
alarm among the public in general and parents
in particular. In some cases no permanent
injury bas resulted, but in many others death
lias ensued. A number of new provisions have
been included. By virtue of section 44 of the
bill a new section of the Code is created. This
deals with types of crime which I have called
sexual offences, and which are covered by
several sections of the Code. The nature of
the amendment is such that if a person is convicted of an offence under the sections relating
to rape, attempted rape or carnal knowledge,
the trial judge may hear evidence to show
whether the person so convicted is a criminal
sexual psychopath. Such evidence shall be
given by two psychiatrists, one of whom shall
be nominated by the Minister of Justice.
Notice of intention to adduce such evidence
will be given to the person charged so that, if
he sees fit, he can adduce evidence on his own
behalf. If after hearing the evidence the judge
concludes that the person convicted of this
sexual offence is a criminal sexual psychopath,

JUNE 16, 1948

he must impose a terra af imprisonmient in a

panitantiary ai nat lass than twa years and
for an indeterminata pariod afterwards.
The idea af the indeterminate sentence is
that the convict shall have curative or reiormat.ive treatment before his is raleased. The
principle invoived is whether the interest and
weliare oi saciety as a wbola shall be the
primary cancern, rather than tha liberty ai ana
who bas off ended in this regard against
society and is a menace ta saciety. Tihe
department bas adapted this course whiia
recognizing that it is ta some extant experimental. Similar legisiation has been adoptad
by eigbt states ai the United States, thea
principla being that the weliare ai saciety
requires persans ai this type ta be kept undar
restraint until such time as it can ha datermined whether reformative or curative processes have been effective. If they are then
deemed ta have iaiied, tise offender will ba
datained indefinitely. It will be recalied tbat
several years aga habituai criminals were made
This
subject ta indeterminwte sentence.
principie is applied in sectian 44. But at least
once in every tisree years during wisich a
persan

is in custady

for an indetarminate

pariod, tha Minister af Justice must reviaw
the case and determine wisctiser tise reformativa treatment bas battered the canviet's condition ta thse extent that ha may saicly be
released. If he decides that immediate release
is inopportune, the convict is subject ta treatment for a iurther periad.
Ail the amendments proplosed under this
bill wiIl came into farce in November ai this
year, except tisose under section 36. This
section deals with part XVI, summary trial ai
certain indictable offences, and will be effective anly as ai October, 1949. Part XVI of
the Code bas been completely repealed and
rewritten, and tise sections under tba new
numbers bear no relation ta the sections under
part XVI ai 'thse present Code. Since a redescription of magistrates and their functions

and duties is involveýd, it was tisought that
same time should elapse in order that Attorneys General ai the variaus provinces may
reorganize magisterial staffs and. perbaps, raise
the standards for appointment if they deam it
desirabie in tise interests ai administration.
Part XVII is also repealed. I believe there
is only ana reported casa dealing with tbe
trial oi juveniles for indictabie offences, the
reasan being tisat tisese cases are being deait
with under tbe Juvenile Delinquents Act.
By section 40 provision is made ta enable
a trial ta conetinue even thougis a juror becomes
ill. What brought this matter ta a bead was
Aiter
the recent Bayer trial in Montreal.
it had proceeded for eleven days a juror
became so iii tbat ha cauld Pot 'take bis place

w8

on the jury. The trial being abortive, it was
necessary for the judge to discontinue the
bearing and dismiss the jury, and start ail
over again.
It is provided by the next seotion that if a
member of the jury becomes iii, the trial, with
the consent of counsel on behaif of both the
Crawn and the accused, shall proceed with the
remaining jurors, subjact only to the proviso
that in provinces where a jury consists of
twelve persons the trial cannot proceed with
less than ten, and in Alberta, where six men
constitute a jury, it cannot proceed with less
than five.
Honourable senators will -recall the situation that arose recently in cannactian with the
Dick case in Hamilton. There was an acquittai
by the Court of Appeal, and the Crown saught
to go to the Suprema Court of Canada. It
was unable ta do so, howe'ver, because the
law provided that one could only go ta the
Supreme Court when one could show that there
was a canfiict in legal dacisions. The proposad
amendment provides that on a question af law
in a crimainal matter, with leave of a judge of
the Supreme Court af Canada, a persan may
go ta that court fram a court af appeal.
The only other amendment that 1 regard
as important is cantained in section 15, which
amends section 501-particularly paragraph (b)
-of the 'Criminal Code. This paragraph refera
ta the offence oi intimiidation. The introductory portian af section 501 ai the Code, as it
naw stands, reads as follows:
Every ana is guilty of an offence ..
ho,
mwrongfully and without lawful authority, with a
view ta campe! any other persan ta abstain ironi
doing anything which he has a lawfi right ta,
do. or ta do anything from which he has a law fui
right ta abstain,
(b) intimidates sncb other person, or bis wiie
or eidren, by threats...
Paragraph (b), as amended, makes it an
affence ta cither tb.reaten or attempt ta intimidate. This amendment also extends the range

of the famiy irom wiie or children, ta take in
the wife, child, parent, or other relation.
Frankly. in my opinion, the term "other relation" is vague and indefinite, and I cannat
say just what it embraces. I do not know
whether it includes nephews, nieces and cousins
or nat, but it certainiy includes grandparents.
i think the amend.ment was conceivad with
the best ai intentions because, by specifie
referience, it covers any attempt ta intimidate
by threat relatives who may be outside of
Canada. There has been some experience ai
that sort ai thing, and it was flt that the
addition af this provision ini the Code 'would

hcofa same value. Should this amendment be
approved, it will ha an offence ta threaten
that misfortune will be visited upon sameone's

SENATE
relations in some other country should the
person threatened not follow a certain course
of action here in Canada.
The other amendments in the bill deal with
particular situations, some being the result of
omissions. For instance, as the section, in the
Code now stands, there is a great deal of procedure in connection with the securing of bail
after committal for trial. At present a man
has to surrender himself and be taken into
custody, and then he must appear before a
judge and be arraigned before the application
for bail is made. The addition of the words
"or magistrate" simply means that the committing magistrate may admit a person to bail.
This is a simplification of procedure, and does
not involve any substantial change in the law.
There are other amendments of a similar
character, but I have not referred ta them
specifically as I anticipate that the bill will
be referred to an appropriate committee of the
Senate.
The motion was agreed ta, and the bill was
read the second time.

APPENDIX

To the Honourable
The Speaker of the Senate:
Sir:' On July 9, 1947, the Senate passed the
following resolution:"That the subject matter of the final report of
the Standing Committee on Divorce be referred
to the Parliamentary Counsel of the Senate for
.consideration and report immediately following
the opening of the next session of parliament."
The subject matter of the report of the
committee which the undersigned was directed
to consider is contained in the last paragraph
of the committee's report and reads as

follows:"In view of the fact that the number of applications for divorce has been increasing by
leaps and bounds, this year reached an all-time
high, and may continue to increase, your committee recommends that parliament should immediately seek a solution of the problem of
dealing with divorce in the province of Quebec
by other than parliamentary action."
The undersigned has considered various proposals made from time to time in the Senate
and elsewhere for dealing with the subject
matter of divorce in the province of Quebec
by other than parliamentary action, and
advises that they contemplate conferring upon
a court, jurisdiction to entertain divorce
applications from the province of Quebec.
Eight of the nine provinces of Canada now
have courts exercising jurisdiction in divorce.
The divorce law administered by these courts
is not uniform.
Briefly, the law in force in the various provinces is as follows:Nova Scotia:
A pre-Confederation Act, chapter 13 of 29
Victoria (1866) established a divorce court
for that province and provided that divorce
might be granted on the grounds of consanguinity, adultery, cruelty and impotence.
New Brunswick:
A pre-Confederation Act, chapter 5 of 51
George III (1791) established a divorce
court for that province and provided that
divorce might be granted on the grounds
of consanguinity, adultery and impotence.
Prince Edward Island:
A pre-Confederation Act, chapter 10 of 5
William IV (1835) established a divorce
court for that province consisting of the

Lieutenant Governor and five members of
the Council and provided that divorce might
be granted on the grounds of consanguinity,
adultery or impotence.
The three pre-Confederation divorce courts
referred to above were continued by section
129 of the B.N.A. Act.
British Columbia:
The law of England on the subject of
divorce as of 1857, except as modified by Acts
of the Parliament of Canada relating to
divorce passed since that date, is in force
in the province of British Columbia and
the provincial courts have jurisdiction in
divorce.
Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta:
The law of England as to divorce and
annulment as it stood on the 15th day of
July, 1870, except as modified by Acts of
the Parliament of Canada passed subsequent
thereto, is in force in the provinces of
Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta and
the provincial Superior Courts of the respective provinces have jurisdiction in divorce.
Ontario:
In Ontario, the Supreme Court of Ontario
derives its jurisdiction in divorce and annalment from the Divorce Act (Ontario)
chapter 14 of the statutes of Canada 1930.
The law introduced by that Act was the law
of England as to the dissolution of marriage
and as to the annulment of marriage as that
law existed on the 15th day of July, 1870, in
so far as it could be made to apply to the
province of Ontario and in so far as it had
not been repealed as to the province by any
Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom or by any Act of the Parliament of
Canada or by the Act of 1930 and as altered,
modified or affected, as to the province, by
any such Act.
The grounds for divorce in England, under
the law in force in that country in the year
1870, were, on the petition of the husband,
adultery; on the petition of the wife, incestuous adultery, bigamy with adultery, rape,
sodomy, bestiality, adultery coupled with
such cruelty as without adultery would have
entitled her to a divorce a mensa et thoro
adultery coupled with desertion, without
reasonable excuse, for two years or upwards.

SENATE

The Acts of Canada passed since 1870
altering the law of England on the subject
are the Marriage and Divorce Act, chapter
127 of the Revised Statutes of Canada 1927;
The Divorce Jurisdiction Act, 1930; and The
British Columbia Divorce Appeals Act, 1937.
Chapter 127 of the Revised Statutes consolidates several Acts relating to Divorce in
force prior to the year 1927 among them
chapter 41 of the Acts of 1925 which abolished the double standard in Canada.
Quebec:
In Quebec, there is no divorce law in force
and the Civil Code provides by article 185
that marriage can only be dissolved by the
natural death of one of the parties; while
both live, it is indissoluble. This is a preConfederation law continued in force by
section 129 of the B.N.A. Act. It can be
altered by the Parliament of Canada but
since Confederation it has not been so altered
except in the case of individuals and the
Quebec courts have held that the Parliament
of Canada is the only tribunal which can
legally grant a divorce to a person domiciled in Quebec. If, therefore, the Parliament of Canada legislates to provide a court
to deal with divorce in Quebec it must go
further and provide the law that the court
shall administer, that is, enact a divorce law
for Quebec. What that law is to be is a
matter for the consideration of Parliament.
Various proposals have been made as to
what court, if any, should be given jurisdiction to deal with divorce applications in the
province of Quebec. The one which commends itself to some is that the Quebec
Superior Court be given jurisdiction in
divorce, thus treating Quebec in this regard
the same as the other provinces and providing that the law to be administered be the
same as that in force in Ontario. There are
many reasons why, if Quebec is to have a
divorce law at all, this court should be
clothed with jurisdiction to administer it. It
is the court which deals with other civil
rights of persons domiciled in Quebec.

It has been suggested that jurisdiction in
divorce be conferred on the Exchequer Court
of Canada and that the law of England as to
the dissolution of marriage as of 1870 be
made applicable to Quebec, thereby making
the law relating to the dissolution of marriage in Quebec the same as that in force in
Ontario.
A third suggestion is that the Exchequer
Court of Canada be given jurisdiction
throughout Canada, where either of the
parties is domiciled in Canada, and that the
Superior Court of each province be given
jurisdiction within the province, where either
of the parties is domiciled in the province,
but that an exception be made in the case
of the Superior Court of Quebec. The effect
of this proposal would be to give the
Exchequer Court exclusive jurisdiction in
divorce in the province of Quebec and concurrent jurisdiction with the provincial courts
in the other provinces.
Another proposal which has been urged
by some writers is the establishment of a
new divorce court for the Dominion having
exclusive jurisdiction in matters of marriage
and divorce.
None of the proposals so far advanced
have been supported by any body of opinion
in the province of Quebec. Senators and
Members of the House of Commons fromr
the province have consistently opposed giving any right, to a person domiciled in
Quebec, to apply to a court for a decree dissolving a Quebec marriage.
If the Parliament of Canada decides to
deal with the problem of divorce in the
province of Quebec by other than parliamentary action, it will first have to enact a
divorce law for the province and confer
jurisdiction to administer it on one or other
of the existing courts or set up another court
for the purpose.
Respectfully submitted,
J. F. MacNEILL,

Law Clerk and Parliamentary Counsel,
The Senate.

He said: Honourable senators, I should like
very much to have had the Minister of
Finance before the committee at its previous
meeting, but unfortunately pressure of affairs
elsewhere did flot permit of his attendance.
The government attaches considerable importance ta the matters with which the comnrnittee bas deait, and it is desirable that the
committee should give thern further consideratian. I suggest, therefore, that a meeting of the committee be held on Wednesdy
morning next, ta enable the minister ta be
:iresent.
Han. Mr. HAIG: As one who supported the
imendments, I agree that it would be better
ta refer themi back ta the cornmittee than
ta deal with them in this house. Ia comnmittee we can talk back and forth without
being limited by strict rules of debate, and in
that way get a better understanding of the
situation. I arn delighted ta learn that the
minister himself will be preseýnt.

WAR VETERANS' ALLOWANCE BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. WISHART McL. 'ROBERTSON
moved the second reading of Bill 196, an Act
ta amond the War Veterans' Allowance Act,
1946.
Hie said: Honourable senators, as you are
aware, the War Veterans' Allowance Act was
passed in 1930 ta provide financial assistance
ta needy and unemployable veterans of World
War I, and ta their widows and orphaued

children. At the end of 1947 about 31,000
persans, 5,000 being widaws or orphans, were
in receipt of these allowances. Last year the
annual liability on this accaunt was appraxirnately $15 million.
The main purpose of the amendrnents proposed by this bill is to help offset the rising
cost of living by increasing bath the basic
allowance and the permissive incarne of the
recipient. The basic allowance is raised by
$120 a year, and the limitation of $125 an the
casual earnings of a recipient bas been
rernoved. Also, in view of the rnounting
volumý" of work involved in the administration of the act, and the higher cast of living,
the %-ilary of each member of the Board is
incraas2d by $1,000.
Changes are made in the definitions of
"~orphan"' and "veteran". in arder to correct
anomalies and to make clear the intention of
the act. It is provided that persans charged
with rnaking false staternents for the purpose
of obtaining an allowance under the art shahl
be deait with by way of surnrary conviction
rather than by indietrnent, in whîch case the
fines or penalties can be very severe.

These ameadments, along with others of
a minor nature, have aIl been examined very
carefully by the Veterans Affairs cormîittee
of the other place, and are based upon its
recommendations. As honourable senators are
aware, a committee of another place irequently. makes exhaustive study of various
matters in cannection with veterans' affairs.
I arn su-re therefore that this legislation, which
ia the main incorporates the views and recommendations of that cornrittee, will comrnend
itself ta honourable members.

Hon. Mr. CRERAR: Will the honourable
leader tell the house what increase in expenditure is involved in this legisiation?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Last year the
expendi.ture amounted ta $15 million. I have
no information at hand which indicates what
the increase will be. I arn quite sure that
information wi.ll be available in committee.
Hon. G. V. WHITE: Honourable senators,
I rise for the purpose of heartily supporting
this measure. Some may feel that it should
have gone a little further, and provided more
generous allowances ta veterans and their
dependents; but I feel that under the curcumstances the committee lias done very well.
May 1 at this time make a suggestion for
what it is worth? If a Committee on Veterans
Affairs is set up at the next session of parliament, it seems ta me that it miglit be advis.
able ta make it a j oint committee of bath
houses, so that members of the Senate could

become more conversant with the legislation
which is being placed on the statute books with
regard to veterans and their dependents.

DOMINION ELECTIONS BILL
SECOND

READING POSTPONED

On the Order:
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Stand!
Honourable senators, in asking that this bill
stand, I would express the hope and intention
that it will be proceeded with next Monday
night. Should the Labour Code and the Income
Tax Bill reach this house by that time, I may
ask honourable senators to give both of these
bills first and second readings so that we may
then proceed with the discussion of this bill.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I would suggest to the
leader of the government that we proceed with
Order No. 9 and return to this bill later.
The Dominion Elections Bi.ll is a peculiar one,
and in my experience this house has never
interfered with the measure because it relates
purely to the elections to the other place. I
do not intend te criticize the bill, but I propose
to add sonething to it.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Honourable senators, I am quite willing to go ahead with the
second reading of this bill, but the honourable
senator that I had asked to explain it is not
prepared to do so now.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: He could adjourn the
debate.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: The bill has not been
distributed.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: No, it has not yet
been distributed.
Hon. Mr. MORAUD: Is it the intention of
the government to pass the Income Tax Bill
this session?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I know of nothing
to the contrary. It depends on parliament.
The Order stands.

VETERANS' REHABILITATION BILL
SECOND READING

WISHART
McL. ROBERTSON
Hon.
moved the second reading of Bill 200, an Act
to amend the Veterans' Rehabilitation Act.
He said: Honourable senators, this bill
makes a number of amendments to the Veterans' Rehabilitation Act. These amendments
are minor in character, but in the light of
three years' experience in administering the
Act, they are deemed desirable and necessary.
It will be recalled that the Veterans Rehabilitation Act was designed to provide various forms of assistance and training te help
veterans make the transition from the armed
forces to civilian life. Under the Act, some
55,000 veterans have taken or are taking university training, and some 93,000 more have
received or are receiving vocational training.
The Veterans Affairs Committee of another
place, which heard representatives of veterans
organizations and of the department, carefully considered these amendments, which are
intended te correct various anomalies that
have arisen in the administration of the Act.
The bill makes provision for the payment
of an allowance te a veteran who is in process
of legally adopting a child, or te a veteran
whose wife has an illegitimate child that he is
maintaining. Compensation is provided for
veteran-trainees
who have been disabled
through accident in the course of their training. There is an amendment te make clear
that veterans now serving in the permanent
forces do not qualify for these rehabilitation
benefits upon retirement from the service, say,
twenty years from now. Another amendment
has to do with the transfer of veterans from
university training to vocational training and
vice versa, the intention being to make it
casier in future for a veteran to transfer if he
so desires. Finally, it is proposed that vetcrans who have undergone some training and
who wish to take advantage of the Veterans'
Land Act may be reinstated in their entitlement to Veterans' Land Act benefits upon
repayment of the training allowances they
have drawn from the government. There are
a good many minor amendments, but these
are the most important ones. I may say to
my honourable friend from Churchill (Hon.
Mr. Crerar) that at the moment I have no
estimate of the inrreased expenditures under
this bill either, but I shall see that the
information is forthcoming.
I would suggest that after second reading
the bill be referred to the Committee on
Banking and Commerce.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the second time.

REFERRED TO COMMfl'TE

Hon Mr. ROBERTSON moved that the
bill be referred to the Standing Cornrittee on
Banking and Commerce.
The motion was agreed to.
TARIFF BOARD BILL
SECOND READING

lion. WISHART
McL. ROBERTSON
moved the second reading of Bill 345, an Act
to amend the Tariff Board Act.
fie &aid: Honourable senators, the purpose
of this bill is to, make certain amendrnents
whîch are ne cessary ini order to reconstitute
the Tariff Board, which at present is unable
to carry out its duties because the only member of the board is its chairman, Mr. Hector
McL{innon. The other two, members retired
in 1943, -on the expiry of their ten-year ternis.
It is proposed to fill the vacancies at the
earli*est possible date, and the bill contains
amendments which it is hoped wiIl enable the
board to function more efflciently.
Honourable senators wiIl recali that the
board was set up in 1931 with two main
duties: to conduet inquiries, into tariff matters
specifically referred to it by the Minister of
Finance, and to act as a board of appeal from
the decisions of the administrative authorities
under the Customs Aict, the Excise Act and
the Excise Tax Act. During the war there
were no references by the minister on tariff
matters, and the sole member of the board
bas been fully occupied with international
tariff negotiations. On the other hand, appeals
from administrative rulings continued to corne
in to the board; but they cou-Id not be heard.
as one -rnember does not constitute a quorum
for tbis purpose, and tbere was no provision
for temporary appointment of board members.
Ten or twelve of these appeals by Canadian
interests are now awaiting bearing, and the
Minister of National Revenue is anxious to
bave thema disposed of. Furtber, a bill to
amend the Custorns Act wbich is n*ow before
another place greatly facilitates appeals to the
Tariff Board.
Tbe amendments contained in the bill
anticipate that the Tariff Board will be reconstituted and enter upon a period of greatly
increased activity. The bill proposes varions
amendrnents. First, tbe terrni of appointment
of the board's members is made more flexible,
and there is provision for appointment of a
temporary member when a regular incumbent
is ili or absent frorn tbe country. Tbis would
overcome some difficulties met with in recent
years. Secondly, tbe staff of the board, apart
erom the three members, is brought under the
5853--39

591

Civil Service Act, and future staff appointments will be made by tbe Civil Service Commission. In tbe tbird place, the pension for
board members will in future be on a contributory basis under the Civil Service Superannuation Act, and the old provisions for noncontributory pensions are repealed. The chairman's salary is raised frorn $12,000 to, $15,000,
which is what it was in 1933.
Hon. Mr. HORNER: Since the government
is adopting a policy of tariff by prohibitions,
I should think that tbe Tariff Board's work
would be falling off.
,Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I would rernind
my honourable friend that "bope springs

CANADIAN NATIONAL RALLWAYS
FINANCINO AND GUARANTEE
BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON rnoved tbe second
reading of Bill 346, an Act to authorize tbe provision of moneys to meet certain capital
expenditures made and capital indebtedness
incurred by the Canadian National Railways
System during the calendar year 1948, and
to authorize the guarantee by His Majesty
of certain securities to be issued by tbe Canadian National Railway Company.
He said: Honourable senators, I bave asked
the bonourable gentleman from Inkerman
(Hon. Mr. Hugessen) to explain this bill.
Hon. A. K. HUGESSEN: Honourable senators, tbis is a bill to provide tbe capital requirements of the Canadian National Railways for
the year 1948. With one exception, to*wbich I
shaîl corne in a few moments, the bill is sirnilar to others that bave been approved by
parliament over a number of years. Aside from
that exception, I think it will be unnecessary
for me to discuss tbe measure in detail.

SENATE

The bill provides for a total authorized
capital expenditure by the Canadian National
Railways during the current year amounting
to $101,697,000, of which $15,815,000 is available from reserves already on hand, leaving
a total net capital expenditure, of $85,882,000
to be provided by parliament under this
legislation.
The bill contains the usual provisions
authorizing the Canadian National Railways to
issue and sell its securities to the amnount that
I have named, and for the guarantee of those
securities by the government; furtber, it
authorizes the governiment, pending the issue
and, sale of the s;ecurities, to make temporary
advances to -the railway.
Hon. Mr. EULER: Do 1 understan-d that
the sum to be providýed by parliament is
$85,000,000?
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: Yes.
Hon. Mr. EULER: What proportion of
that amount is to ho raised by the issue of
bonds or securities, and what amount is Vo
corne eut of the Con-3olidated Revenue Fund?
Hon. Mr. mJGESSEN: It is impossible
for me to answer that question at tbe

Hon. Mi. EULER: 1 would hope nlot.
Hon. Mr. HUGESSENý: W hile the authorizatien izfor $K5,000.000, it is unlikely tliat the
railwav wiii be able te spend thaît, amount
this year, the reason beiog that some of the
things tbey want to buy are tînavailable. Part
of the expenditure may ho covered by a special
issue of bonds and part by permanent loans
from the governmcnt.

Hon. Mr. HOWARD:

Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: Yes, it dependa on
the mnarket for the securities and the termis
obtainable at that time.
Hon. Mr. HORNER: Wby does flot tbe
Bank of Canada issue the money?
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: I do noV think that
policy bhas commended itself to parliament
in the past. The Central Bank was not set
Up for the purpose of advancing money to
eitber public or priva te corporations.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: It seems to me tbat
before authorizing tbe raising of such a large

sum of money we should know the purpose for
which it is required.
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: I arn coming Vo
that point, and I hope Vo satisfy my bonourable friend before I arn tbrougb.
Hon. Mr. LEGER: I am curious to know
what the capital debt of the Canadian
National Railways is at the present time.
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: Tbe capital indebtedness of the Canadian National Railways, as of Deceýmber 31, 1947, will be found
in tbe annual report of the company, whicb
bas been circulated among honourable senators. Its funded debt to the public iýs $582
million; boans made by the Dominion Goveroment amount to, $689 million.
Hon. Mr. MORAUD:
I understood the
bonourable senator to say that the $85,000,000
will not be spent tbis year. What portion
of that amount will be spent this year?
Hon. Mr. CO'PP: It may nlot be spent this
year.
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: Perhaps my friend,
if bie will permi.t me to go on witb mny explanation of the details of the expenditures,
will be bettcr able Io judge the amounts whicb
are unlikely to be spent this year.
Tbe
items
comprising
the total
of
8101,697.200 will be found in section 2 of the
bill. Tbcy are as follows:

Hon. Mr. HIJGESSEN: IV consists of about

Subsidiary companies ..........
1,375,000
These are the ordinary items of capital
expenditure. This statement which, with permission of the house, I shall place on Han.sard,
gives the details of twenty-seven categories of

expenditure by the railway.
(See Appendiz at end of today's report)
Hon. Mr. HAIG:

Will the honourable

gentleman illustrate what the items mean?

Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: I will take the
first item, rails and fastenings. In the Atlantic
region the railway proposes to spend $110,000
for those items. Picking out other items at
random, I see ballast, tunnels. shops, enginebouses and machinery, signais and interlockers
and so on. Under each heading the proposed
expenditures are itemized.

Hon. Mr. EULER:- But many of them
would appear noV to be capital expenditures.
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: Items other 'than
capital expenditures are noV included in this
table.
There will be a great number of
expenditures for maintenance; but these are
additional capital expenditures.

Hon. Mr,. MORAUD: Ballast is maintenance.

Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN:

Ballast is only

maintenance in s0 far as it represents replacing
ballast with the same type as was used
previously; but if rock ballast, for instance,
is used where previously there was only sand
ballast, part of the expenditure can be treated
as capital.

Hon. Mr. MORAUD: The item of $9,000,000 would, 1 suppose, include a large -expenditure for the Barraute branch line.
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: Expenditures for
that line are flot included in the $9,000,000.
Honourable senators will perbaps be interested in the item, under additions and betterments, of $2,500,000 for Montreal office
building. Honourable members who have
been in Montreal recently will have noticed

that there is a building going up over the
eastern part of the Central station; as -a
matter of fact, the steelwork for the new
building is practically completed. While that
')uilding is being constructed by and will be
the property of the Canadian National Railways, it will in fact be an aviation 'building.
It is to house the beadquarters of ail the air
lines which operate in and around Montreal.
It is also to, be the head office of the private
corporation formed by ahl the international air
5853-391

lines of the world, to which parliament granted
incorporation ýtwo years ago. More important
still, the building is Vo, be headquarters of the
International Civil Aviation Organization, the

governmental body under the United Nations
which deals with international questions relating to world aviation. I think it'can be said
that this building will be the civil aviation
centre of 'the world.

Hon. Mr. LEGER: But what bas ýthat to
do with the Canadian National Raiiways?
Hon.. Mr. HUGESSEN: 1V is built on property belonging to the Canadian National
Railways.

Hon. Mr. HAIG. Wby should the railway
build it?
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: The second item of

capital expenditure contained in section 2 of
the bill, is $59,000,000 for new equipment. 1
have here a breakdown of the items of that
new equipment, and witb permission I will
place it on the record.

The general reason for this large item of new
equipment is one which applies Vo aIl the railways on this continent: it arises from inability
Vo obtain ne'w equipment d'uring the war, and

also extreme wear and tear on exîsting equipment as a Tesult of use during the war.
Hon. Mr. MORAUD: The railway bas built

up a large reserve for that replacement. Could
we have -the exact figure?

SENATE

Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: Perhaps my honourable friend is referring to what is called the
deferred maintenance fundHon. Mr. M'ORAUD: That may be so.
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: -which appears on
the consolidated balance sheet of December 31
last at a figure of $25,000,000. That refers only
to deferred maintenance, not to new capital
expenditures.

Hon. Mr. HAIG: I may tell my honourable
friend that Diesel locomotives are used at
Winnipeg, and have been in use on both railroads for the last year and a half. My honourable friend had better wake up.
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: Perhaps I should
amend my remark, and say that the rest of
Canada is going to follow the lead of
Winnipeg.

Hon. Mr. MORAUD: What is the difference? They are going to use that $25,000,000 for replacements, are they not?

Hon. Mr. HAIG: They tried it out on us,
and we did not die, so these locomotives are
going to be used everywhere else.

Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: Yes, I assume they
will. I am not sure what is the exact relation
between this item for new equipment and the
deferred maintenance reserve. But I understand that if this measure is referred to the
Standing Committee on Banking and Commerce, the Comptroller of the Canadian
National Railways will appear before that
committee, and he will be able to answer the
honourable senator's question and other questions of that kind much better than I can.
The particulars of this new equipment are of
some interest, and perhaps the house will
excuse me if I go into a few details about
them. In the first place there is provision for
approximately 6,000 new freight-cars of various
types. Honourable senators are aware that not
long ago there was an acute shortageof freightcars in certain parts of the country, and they
will agree, I think, that it is the duty of the
railways to provide sufficient equipment of
that kind to meet ordinary commercial
demands. In the second place, provision is
made for tiwenty Diesel switching locomotives.
That item is of particular interest to our
larger centres, such as Montreal and Toronto,
which have considerable reason to complain
about the smoke nuisance in the railway yards.

Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: The third item
relates to passenger-cars-of which twenty-five
are air-conditioned coaches and twenty are
sleeping-cars-and, in addition, fifty baggagecars. Of course these cars will be of steel
construction, a fact of very great importance
from the standpoint of safety. There are still
employed in the passenger service of our lines
a large number of wooden coaches, and what
is likely to happen while cars of this type
remain in use was terribly exemplified in the
dreadful accident which took place at Dugald,
Manitoba, in September last year.
It is astonishing to what a degree safety can
be enhanced by the use of all-steel coaches
instead of wooden coaches. Perhaps the house
will allow me to mention a personal experience. A few years ago I was travelling from
the East on a train consisting of steel sleepingcar cars, except for one old wooden compartment-observation car which happened to be
in the middle of the train. While our train
was standing on the main line, a train travelling in the opposite direction ran into us.
Fortunately it was going quite slowly, and
those of us who were asleep in the steel
sleeping-cars felt no more than a bump that
was perhaps a little harder than one would
normally expect from the stopping of a train.
No damage was done to the steel cars, but the
wooden car in the middle was compressed like
a concertina, and was completely wrecked.
But for the fact that very few people were
in it, there would have been considerable loss
of life. The remains of the wooden car were
simply thrown to the side of the tracks, the
steel cars were connected up, and the train
went on its way. I think honourable senators
will realize that, by providing in this budget
for new steel passenger equipment, the Canadian National Railways are doing what they
can to avoid such incidents.
One word of warning in relation to this large
item of $59,000,000 is, I believe, necessary.
The honourable senator from Toronto-Trinity
(Hon. Mr. Roebuck) asked how much is likely
to be spent this year. It is all very well to

Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: Right you are!
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: The new Diesel
electric locomotives are designed to reduce
this nuisance to a minimum. I believe it is
intended ultimately to replace with Diesel locomotives all the switching locomotives in the
large freight-yards.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: When may that be
ýexpected to take place?
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: I am afraid I can:not answer that.
Hon. Mr. LEGER: Will all these Diesel
engines be allotted to Montreal and Toronto?
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: It may be that
one or two will find their way to minor centres
such as Winnipeg. I do not know.

JUJNE 17, 1948
make estimates of the equipment one wants to
buy, but under pre.sent conditions it is very
doubtful whether ail of it can be obtained.
The manufacturera of equipment are booked
up for many months, even years, ahead; and
it is very difficuit to get new equipment when
you want it. As an example, let me cite
some figures pertaining to last year. In 1947, in
a bill similar to the present one, we voted
$41,500,000 for new equipment for the Canadian
National Railways; in point of fact the comnpany were able to spend last year only
$9,600,000.
Hon. Mr. ROBBUCK: That need not prevent them putting a littie new ballast on the
rocky road between Ottawa and Toronto.
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: That, I believe, is
a Canadian Placific line, is it noV?
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK:- I do noV think so.
There are pool trains, anyway.
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: Yes. I Vhink they
rua over the Canadian Pacific railway.
The third item of these expenditures is
$1,440,000, required for the Barraute brandi
Uine.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: That is only part of the
cost, is it noV?
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: Yes. The total
length of the line is fifty-five miles, and the
estimated cost is $4,125,000. The building of
that lîne was authorized in 1946; the flrst
thirty-nine miles are now under construction,
and $1,180,000 was expendcd on the work
during 1947. IV is expected that, with this
additional grant of $1,440,000, the thirty-nine
miles wiIl have, been completed by December 1
next.
The fourth item is $20,000,000 of additional
working capital. The reason this money is
needed is, I think, fairly clear; it is the great
increasa in the volume of Vraffic over the past
few yeurs, and the larger amount and incrcased
cost of supplies and materials required to be
held in stock. The value of the materials and
suppliesi on hand on December 31 last was
niearly $63,000,000. Perhaps I should say that
although the total amount of working capital
required is $20 million, ail of it will not be
applied for immediately. Applications will lie
made to the governmient for the release of
additional working capital as required from
timýe to time. Should the business of the
railway recede to any considerable extent, and
should it lie found possible to reduce the
inventory of materials and supplies, repayment of any excess working capital will be
made to the government.

595

I now want to, discuss two new provisions
not to be found in any similar legislation with
whieh this parliament has previously dealt. I
refer Vo sections 9 and 10. Section 9 allows
the Mînister of Finance, with the approval
of the Governor in Council, Vo advance temporarily to the Canadian National Railways,
any tirne before April 1, 1949, the amount of
any differences between its expenses and its
income. Such a temporary advance would
have Vo be replaced in due course by parliamentary appropriations. The reason for Vhis
is that in pre-war years it was the practice to
estimate, in anticipation of the annual budget,
what the deficit of the Canadian National
Railways was going to be.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: What was it last year?
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: The actual deficit
of the Canadian National Railways was
approximately $15 million. For reasons that
my honourable friend can well appreciate, it
is felV to be unwise tot attempt to make any
such estimate for the current year.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: They did publiai an
estimate.
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: Yes, but a number
of tiings have happened since. In the annual
report of the Canadian National Railways it
was stated that the estimate could only lie A
wild guess.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: What lias happened since?
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: Firstly, there was an
increase in freight rates; secondly, there was
a demand for very substantial additional wages,
the amount of which lias not yet been determmcnd; and, tbirdly, under present conditions
the cost of coal and fuel supplies for the
balance of the year is indefinite. It was felt,
therefore. that it would; be wise not Vo determine Vhe finances on tic basis of an estima te
for the current ycar, but to deal with whatever
deficits may arise by tic mcthod providcd in
Section 9 of the il
Section 10 provides a similar method for
dcaling with deficits that may arise in connection with the Trans-Canada Air Lines during
the course of the current year and until
April 1, 1949.
If this bull is given second reading, I would
move that it be referred Vo the Standing Comnmiittee on Banldng and Commerce, where the
comptroller of the Canadian National Railways
will lie available to answcr any questions. This
has been the practîce for the psst two years.
While I am still on my feet may I say that
I thînk it would be a good thing if Vie members of this house had more opportunity to
inquire into the affaira of tic Canadian

SENATE

National Railways? I notice that the bonourable senator from Pembroke (Hon. Mr. White)
suggestcd that the cornmittee dealing with
veterans' affairs might be a joint committee of
both houses. At the present tirne the annual
estirnates of the Canadian National Railways
are submitted to a comrnittee solely of rnembers of the other house. I would venture to
suggest that it might flot be a bad idea for
honourable senators tu join with members of
the other house in asking questions of the
officers of the Canadian National Railways.
Hon. FELIX P. QUINN: Honourable senators, I listened attentively to the bonourable
senator who bas explained this bill, wbicb
involves a huge expenditure of money, but I
did not hear him make any reference to the
furnishing of Diesel engines for the city of
Halifax. When the building of the new terminaIs at Halifax was commenced in 1913, the
railway authorities promised that upon completion of the terminaIs amokeless engines
would be provided for the operation of the
railway from the south end into and through
the residential section of the city. The train
smoke in that area bas become an awful
nuisance. The mayor, the city council, the
Halifax board of trade, and other organizations
in that city have repeatedly made requests to
have the situation remedied, but as yet they
have flot met with success. No provision bas
been made in this bill to furnish Diesel engines
to take care of the railway traffic out of Halifax,
as far as the assembly yards at Rockingham.
This is a matter of great concern to the city of
Halifax, and until sucb provision is made, even
if I arn the only member in thia bouse to do s0,
1 shaîl vigorously oppose the passage of this
bill.
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: I assume that my
honourable friend from Bedford-Halifax refers
solely to switching engines.
Hon. Mr. QUINN: No. I refer to every
engine that enters the city of Halifax from
the assembly yards at Rockingham. As my
honourable friend knows, the traffic goes in
a circle rigbt around to the waterfront.
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: As I have stated,
there is provision for twenty 1,000 borsepower
Diesel-electric switching locomotives, anme of
wbicb may be employed in the Halifax yards.
There is also provision for two Diesel-electric
road locomotives wbich, I understand, may
be employed in that area. In fact, last aummer there were some trial runs of beavy-load
Dieael-electric locomotives on the line between
Montreal and Halifax.

bound in the matter, and parliament, which

rubber st.amp. I assume that the Canadian
National Railways, like any other business,
bas banking facilities. Wby then is it necessary to tie up parliament in advance by
having the name of tbe cabinet bebind this

this bouse.

Hon. Mr. HAIG: la my bonourable friend
tbrough?
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK:

Yes, I am.

Hon. Mr. HAIG: I merely wisb to say a
word or two about this problem. Wben I had
the pleasure of entering this bouse thirteen
years ago this was one of the serins problerna
of our country, and it stili remains an. The
railways fell behind sonie $15 million last
year. They got a 21 per cent increase in
freigbt rates, wbich bas given risc to a tremendous problem for eastern and western
Canada. That was illustrated by the application before the Board of Transport Commissioners. The two central provinces did .not
oppose the application for increased freigbt
rates, but strong opposition was made by tbhe
four western and tbree Maritime Provinces.
Fundamentally, the Canadian National's
trouble arises from the fact that every time it
needs money it cornes to parliarnent and gets
a hlank cheque. No business enterprise or
individiual could carry on suctcessfully in tibat
way. If a cbild at borne waa given a dollar

JUNE 17, 1948
every time he asked for it, hie would grow up
without any sense of the value of money; and
h,- might have to go through a very bitter
experience before hie hearned his lesson. I say
that Canada cannot prosper if it continues to
hand out $85 million a year ta, one raihiway.
There should be an inquiry into the Canadian
National to determine just what its assets are
worth, and then it shouhd be told to go ahead
and pay its way on the basis of that valuation.
In other words, it shouhd be required to carry
on as private organizations do, and flot corne
running to parliarnent every year for $85 million. The so-cailed debt of the railfway is
$1 ,200 million, and the system is flot worth
that much.
My honourable friend from Inkerman (Hon.
Mr. Hugessen) says tihat the surn asked for
here represents capital investrnents. That is
not the proper term at ahl. To refer to these
expenditures as capital investments is rnerehy
to use a termi that is more palatable to the
public tian the correct termi wouhd be.
The railway men are now asking for an
increase in wages. I know nothing at ail about
the merits of that request, but I do know that
if it is granted there wiil be an application
from the railways for a further increase in
freight rates, because witbout increased revenue
the rond whose needs the Transport Board
considered as a standard-the Canadian
Pacific-wouhd be unable to carry on.
We in western Canada are desperately
troubled over the freight rate question, for we
are a long distance from the source of supply
of moat of the goods that we have to bring in
from outside. The samie is true of the Maritime Provinces. To help the Maritirnes meet
their problern we have made great concessions
every year, on the recommendation of the
Duncan commission. But no such concessions
are made to the West, and the tirne is rapidly
approaohing when the products of the West
wiIl have ta face competition on world markets.
My honourable friends opposite rnay say
thiat so far this year business conditions bave
been pretty good; but I notice that grain
prices on the world mnarket are going down.
Ilye is dawn to about half of what it was a
year ago, and wheat is fahhing. Oats and barley
will dechine too, especiahhy if there la as good
a crop overseas as is in prospect. And when
prie" drop the farmers will dernand that the
21 per cent increase in freight rates be lif'ted.
True, the Crowsnest agreement prevents thea
application of that increase to wheat, but the
higher freight charges have to be paid on al
the goods brought inta the West.
I know that the Ganadian National cannot
carry on witÈout the rnoney asked for in this

597

bill, but that is because of the burden of the
so-called debt of $1,200 ilflion. Most western
newspapers, and certainly the leadmng ones,
have for years advocated that this camouflage
be discontinued and that the railway's liabilities be placed in a proper light. So long as it is
said that this figure represents the outstanding
debt, what indiucemenlt is there for the management to try to make the road pay? 1 arn
reminded of the glowing picture that was
painted when the bill to incorporate the TransCanada Air Lines was introduced; but we
know how different the reslult has been. Last
year, for instance, instead of a huge profit there
was a loss of about $1J million.
We ail remember that in the early thirties
the Canadian, National was said to be going
behind 'at the rate of about $50 million
annually. In 1936, niy first session in this
bouse, the governrnent of the day brought in
a bill to do away with the commission that
was managing the railway and to substitute a
board of directors to hold office during pleasure
-in other words, as we would say on the
hustings, a board of political directors. The
majority in the Senate then was opposed to
the government, yet we passed that bill. Why?
Because we were convinced that as long as the
Canadian National could get rnoney from
parliament for the -asking, it would make no
difference wbether the management was a
board of political directors or of business men.
1 suggest that next session a bill setting
forth the Canadian National's rnoney requirements should he brought down early, so as to
give us a chance of exploring the possibîlity
of putting the road on a sound financial basis.
We could hold committee hearings and go
into the whole question in as rnuch detail as
we wished, just as we did with the income tax
question. 1 should like to ask the officers what
the road in Western Canada is doing. And
my honourable fTienda from Quebec could
satisfy their curiosity about the Barraute
branch line. I recaîl that when the bill for
the construction of that hune wffs brought in
one of our colleagues expressed strong doubt
that the hine could be made to pay. Some
of us wouhd also inquire into the railway's
experience with Diesel engines. My honourable
friend from Inkerman (Hon. Mr. Hugessen)
does not seem to think there are any of those
engines in Winnipeg, but I can assure him hie
is wrong. I think there are likely some in
Montreal too.
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: There are seine in
the Canadian Nutional yards at Montreal, but
not nearly enough.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Are they being used as
an experiment?

SENATE

Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: Oh, no.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: When they were first
used at Winnipeg both railways candidly stated
that it was an experiment.
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: The experimental
stage bas been passed.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Honourable senators, we
are flot so busy in this bouse that we have
flot time to inquire into the Canadian
National's operations.
If we undertook a
study next session, we might be able to make
a recommendation that would help to solve
the existing difficuit railway problem. When
we have once arrived at a fair figure for the
value of the assets, we can say to the management, "Now go ahead and make the road pay."
I should like to see a law passed requiring
Ontario aind Quebec to 'buy their coal from
Alberta. Coal should be shipped also from the
Maritimes.
Hon. Mr. COPP: Quite a bit is shipped.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: A very small arnount is
sent up by boat to Montreal. Think of the
amount we spend for American coal out of our
small reserve of United States dollars, when we
could bring coal from Alberta where there is
more coal 'than in ail the rest of Canada. The
people nf the West are greatly worried over
the increase in freîght rates. 0f course we
are not so slow as to fail to realize that when
wages and costs go up the railway bas to get
more revenue for carrying freight. But what
are we in the West going to do about it?
Hon. A. L. BEAUBIEN:
of it.

We pay the bulk

Hon. Mr. HAIG: That is quite right. The
rest of Canada do-es not seem to appreciate
the problern we face in that respect. True,
the Maritimes sbowed somne concern, and
appointed able men to app-ear before the
Transport Board on the freight rates hearing.
AIl the provinces were represented' by able
men. But the board was hoîînd hy the facts
and decided in favour of the increase. It does
not affect Ontario and Quebec as it does the
West.
I do not intcnd to vote against this bill, and
I sec no purpose in referring it to comrnittee.
An official of the Canadian National Railways
svstern could tell us very little about its operations in an hour or two. I could ask a few
questions that would keep hirn busy for two
or three days. For instance, I should like to
knowv the whole cost of the Barraute line and
what its expenses and revenues are; 1 arn
curious about the operating costs per year of
the transcontinental line from Nakina to
Quebee, and whether it should be discon-

tinued. Further. what Nvere the profits on the
lines fromn Winnipeg to Fort William via Fort
Frances and via Armstrong? We should have
the answers to such questions as these before
being asked to form. an opinion. If we have
too many lines operating under the C.N.R.,
we at least ought to know it.
I shaîl not object to the bill going to coinmittec, but I do flot think it will belp us
much-the railway has to have the money.
Hon. WISHART
MeL. ROBERTSON:
.Honourable senators, the honourable gentleman who explained the bill (Hon. Mr. Hugessen) bas had to leave the chamber, and I have
only a few remarks to make in answer to the
leader opposite.
His suggestion that this
measure should have corne before parliament
earlier in the session is a useful one. I believe
Ihat an inquiry by the Senate into the~ whiole
railway question would be helpful.
It strikes me, however, that the criticism of
the Canadian National Railway is hardly fair.
Honourable senators know that while an
increase of 21 per cent in freight rates was
authorized, a great deal of freigbt is still being
carried und'er agreement at the old. rate. I anfi
told that the over-aIl increase is something
like 15 or 16 per cent.
Hon. Mr. COPP: I think it is less than that.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Honourable senators well know that the Crowsnest agreement,
or any such arrangement to keep the rates
ilown. does îlot niean that the cost of the
servicp is reduced. In aIl fairness it should
he said that the railways have incurred additional costs without increased revenue. Since
the last increase in Canada prior to the recent
one, freighit rates in the United States have
gene up as mucli as 60 per cent. I know it is
impossible to make an exact comparison; but
I think that in the face of rising costs of
materials and wages, the railways of Canada
have given excellent service. Their operatiens reflect grcat credit upon management
and the employees.
When the bill bas been given second reading 1 intend to ask that it be referred to the
Standing Comrnittee on Banking and Commerce. In anticipation of the bill going to
cornrittee, I have arranged a meeting for
Tuesday rnorning next, and even though the
lrne rnay be short, the officiais will be available te answer at least somne of honourable
senators' questions.
Hon, W. D. EULTER: Honourable senators,
at the outset I mnust admit that I find difficulty
in following the reasoning of iny good friend
the leader opposite (Hon. Mr.. Haig).
He
complains about the 21 per cent freiglit rate

J-UNE 17, 1948
increase and says that the West cannot stand
it. 1 arn sure ail will agree that witli the
increases ail along the line-especially in
wages-in every branch of .business, it seems
perfectly reasonable that the railways should
have an increase ini freiglit rates. I do nlot
think we can deny thema an increase.
1 arn not contradicting the statements made
by the leader opposite about the difficulties of
the West, but I would remind hlm, that a good
inany years ago that part of the country
,secured what was called the Crowsnest agreement, and it lias neyer been modified. Soon
after the making of that agreement I had the
honour of being chairman of the Comrnittee on
National Railways and Shipping of the other
place. Perhaps my honourable friend who sits
next to the leader opposite (Hon. Mr. Calder),
-wiiI rernember that committee. An effort was
rnade at that time to aboiish or modify the
Crowsnest agreement. We had a pitcheýd battie
in the committee, and again in the house, over
that question, and I rnust say that it was the
inembers from Ontario who preserved the
'Crowsnest rates for the West.
Hon. A. L. BEAUBIEN: Was that in 1922?
Hon. Mr. EULER: I have forgotten the
-exact date. But I know that the members
froin Ontario defeated the proposai to abolish
ýor modify the agreement by a *majority of
something like one.
As to the Maritime provinces, it would perhaps not be unkind to say tliat they have most
favourable freight rates.
Hon. Mr. QUINN: For a particular reason.
Hon. Mr. EULER: I arn not saying that the
Maritimes should nlot lie so favoured. But it
has been said by way of comparison that
the centrai provinces-and I hoid no brief for
Ontario or Quebec; I like to have a Canadian
point of view-do not suifer fromn the increased
freiglit rates. I may say that it costs the
manufacturers in Ontario as much to ship
their goode to Montreal as it does to ship
to the Maritimes, which is more than twice the
distance to Montreal.
I see no reason for the outcry. The increase
in freight rates has followed the rise in labour
and other costs. That, I think, is why the
provinces of Ontario and Quebec have not
made any protest.
My honourable friend's arguments were
largeiy direeted against the Canadian National
Railways. He said very littie about the
Canadian Pacifie Raiiway. In the oId days,
when I was a member of the other hoeuse, I
was one of the few champions of public ownership of railways. I make no apology for that.
1 have always believed that the Canadian
5853-40

599

National Railways should be owned and controiied by the Dominion of Canada; and I
miglit add in passing that the management of
that road lias done a pretty good job. What
was the situation when the government took
over the Canadian Nortliern, the Grand Trunk,
the Grand Trunk Pacifie and the Intercolonial? All these roads had to be welded
into one harmonious whole, operable as a
single system. That of itself was a tremendously diffilt job. My honourabie frîend
says that the assets are not there. I arn not se
sure that lie is correct. A tremendous capital
expenditure was necessary, and a correspondingiy heavy debt was incurred. Unprofitable
brandi limes could not ail be abandoned. It
is very difficult to earn enougli money to pay
the interest on the indebtedness and to make
a profit as weii.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: May I point out that
interest is charged, not on what is owed to
the government, but only on bonds issued
to tlie public.
Hon. Mr. EULER: And, it would be the
fair thing aiso to charge interest on the debt
which is owing to the government.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: But tliat is not done.
Hon. Mr. EULER: I know. On that point
I agree witli my lionourable friend. I say
tliat if you want tlie correct picture of what
it lias cost to operate the Canadian National
Raiiways you should include not only the
interest owing to outsiders but what is owing
to tlie government. That would lie sound
business. But our present set-up is part of
the price of public ownership of the Canadian National Raiiways. Wliat was the
alternative? The Great Nortliern and the
Grand Trunk were in bankruptcy. Tliere were
only two alternatives; ýthat tlie government
sliouid take over these roads and buiid frorn
tliem one great liarmonious system, or that
they sliould become the property of the
Canadian Pacific Railway; and nobody wanted
a privateiy-owned railway monopoiy in this
country.
I will go a little further. In those days I
was, I believe, the only member of the House
of Coinmons wlio lield that, to eiiminate the
lieavy losses which resulted fromn unnecessary,
wastefui competition between the roadis, if we
were to have a railway monopoly it should lie
publicly-owned rather than.privateiy-controiied.
In expressing this view I wGuld not lie understood as disparaging the Canadian Pacifie Railway, which is a great and well man.aged
road. But taking over the Canadian National
Raiiways involved the amalgamation of

SENATE
various roads under circunistances which made
the systemn extremely difficult to operate at
a profit.
What is the situation today? Competition
is tremendously keen and, perhaps, as between
the two roads, to some textent wasteful 1
remember that during the regime of Mr.
Bennett's government a bill was passed to
provide for a certain degree of "compulsory
co-operation".
0f course "compu]sory cooperation" is a contradiction in terrms; and
about the only resuit of that legisiation wus
a limited service of pooled trains between
Toronto and Ottawa and, possibly, between
Toronto and Montreal. As a matter of fact
it can be said, with no reflection on either
road, that the managements do not make any
particular effort to co-operate in any financially
significant way. So the presont situation is
that the two railroads net only have competition hetween themselves, but must meet
competition from the trucking firms. The
truck is a great handicap to the profitable
operation of these roads; and not only trucks,
but buses and automobiles as well, are carrying merchandise and passengers. This condition is exemplified in the United States, where
the railroads are spending hundreds of millions
of dollars for the purpose of providing a service
which can compete with that given by t.he
trucks, in sanie cases by buses, and by the
ordinary passenger automobile. This requires
money by way of capital expenditure. Coaches
built of steel, as they should bo, and equipped
with air-conditioning and aIl sorts of other
conveniences necessary to attract patronage
to t.he railroads, cost a great deal of money.
When 1 asked the honourable senator froni
Inkerman (Hon. Mr. Hugessen) how m-uch of
thif, $85,000,000 was to be raised by the sale of
securities and how much was to be charged to
the consolidate.d fund, 1 had in mind the, passibility of a deficit. It is of course a wtholly
wrong principle to deal with deficits by borrowrng more money to pay them. The cost of the
actual deficits, unless we are to bring everything to ruin, should come out of the consolidated fund of Canada. The people of Canada
have to pay the losses legitimately inourred
by the Canadian National Railways, and I for
one am perfectly willing to meet my share of
that cost. For m.y part, I would much prefer
that the federal treasury should meet the
deficits of our national railways-even though
they may inýcrease in years to come-than that
the railroads should be operated as a privatelyowned, monopoly.
I had not intended ta take part in this discussion, but it seemed to me that something
should be said by way of explanation of the
difficulties which the Canadian National Rail-

ways have had to face, and why it is almosi
impossible for them to make ends meet. During
the war they did very well, but, as everybody
knows, conditions were abnormal; and if they
are to adapt themselves to transportation as it
is now demanded by the public, and meet the
competition of trucks and other automobiles,
they have simply got to have more money, and
their expenditures will, be capital expenditures.
I do not knýow just what remedy the leader
of the opposition had. in mind for the practice
ta 'which he objeets. 1 understood him to say
that the bill should, have came down earlier,
and that a defin.ite amaunt should have been
asked for, in anticipation of what the deficit
might be.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: It was flot a suggestion ta
limit the amount. What I proposed was ýthat
the bill should be brought down earlier, and
that we should have a proper investigation of
the whole problem. At this stage of the session
any such inquiry is impossible.
Hon. Mr. EULER: As regards the opportunity of obtaining information, 1 am inclined
ta agree with my honourable friend. There is
of course the added bonefit which would accrue
at any time in the session, if you had an exhaustive investigation-that if the officials of
the road knew that they were going to be asked
thýis, that and the other, they would be pretty
careful in administering the funds of the
railway.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Certainly.
Hon. Mr. EULER: At the same time I think
it would be difficult for anyone, especially of
recent years, ta point ta ainy instance of wastefulness in the management of the Caandian
National Railways. I believe that as a board
they have donc a very good job, and there has
been very little criticismn of them, cither in the
other place or in this.
That is aIl I wish ta say. It was merely
from a desire to offer more or less of a defence
of the Canadian 'National Railways, and to
point out tihat it is difflouit for them ta make
things go, and. it may be more difficult if there
is a recession in business. My honourable
friend opposite suggested that the management
sbould, at the beginning of the session, review
their requirements and make an estimate of
Wihat they need. That of itself is a difficult
thing ta do. And ho says that once they make
that estimate. and we vote that mueh. they
ought ta make tbings go with that amount of
money.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: That is what we do with
any other enterprise.

601

JUNE 17, 1948
Hon. Mr. EULER.- That is a pretty diffleuit
thing to do in the railway business.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: This estimate bas been
down in the House of Commons since April 1.
Hou. Mr. EULER: 1 'shahl tell my honourable friend just what would happen. They
would naturatly make an estimate so generous that expenditures would be greater than
necessary. They would play safe.
Hon. Mr. QUINN: The bonourable senator
from Waterloo (Hon. Mr. Euler) bas dwelt
on the contribution that central Canada bas
made to the West under the Crowsnest agreement, and to the East because of the Maritime Freight Rates. This contribution is offset by the canal system whicb serves the two
central provinces and is maintained by the
people of Canada.
Hon. Mr. EULER: That may be correct.
Hon. Mr. QUINN: So we are pretty wel
square on that score.
Hon. Mr. EULER- On the St. Lawrence
canal systemn no charges are levied on either
Canadian or American shipments.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the second time.
REFERRED TO COMMITTEE

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON moved that the
bill be referred to the Standing Committee on
Banking and Commerce.
The motion was agreed to.
TRANSPORT BOARD (CHIEF COMMISSIGNER) BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON moved the second
reading of Bill 347, an Act to amend the Railway Act, the Exchequer Court Act and tbe
Judges Act, 1946.
He said: Honourable senators, this bill was
made necessary *by the .expected retirement
of the present chairman of the Board of
Transport Commissioners, and the prospective appointment of Mr. Justice Archibald of
the Nova Scotia Supreme Court as bis successor. The work of tbe Board of Transport
Commissioners will be important for some
time to corne, especially as the question of
equalization of the freigbt rate structure
tbrougbout Canada bas heen referred to that
body.
It is considered that Mr. Justice Archibald
is extremely well qualified for the position of
chairman. But without the passage of this
bill, bis acceptance of the appointment wouhd
not be possible, because it would mean too
5853-40J

heavy a financial sacrifice as well as losa of
security on bis part. As a Justice of the
Supreme Court of Nova Scotia he enjoys life
tenure as well as valuable pension privileges.
As chairman of the Board of Transport Com-.
missioners, bis termn of office would be for
only ten years, and he would lose lis pension
rights as a judge. The bill proposes to resolve
this difficulty by appointing a judge of the
Exchequer Court to the office of Chief Commissioner. H1e will receive a salary of $15,000
for bis dual position, but will devote bis full
time to the work of the board. The number
of Exebequer Court judges will be increased
by one.
The terms of his appointment will enable
Mr. Justice Archibald to retain bis pension
rights as a judge. However, his tenure of
office will be sbortened, for tbough be could
hold bis office for if e in bis present position,
as an Exehequer Court judge be will be
obliged to retire upon reaching tbe age of
seventy-five. The office of Chief Commissioner is almost wholly a judicial position,
and the passage of this bill will enable the
country to avail itself of his outstandîng
talents. At the conclusion of his ten-year
terra as ebairman of the Board of Transport
Commissioners, Mr. Justice Arcbibald will be
avaîlable either for re-appointment or for
service solely as a judge of the Exchequer
Court. In future the fact that the chairman
of the board is a judge of tbe Exehequer
Court will probably make the position of
chairman more attractive to persons of high
judicial ability than it otherwise would be.
Tbe motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the second time.
THIRD READING

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON moved the third
reading of the bill.
Hon. ANTOINE J. LEGER: Honourable senators, I do not know why it is necessary to change eubsection (2) of section 10
of the Railway Act in order to accomplisb
what tbe honourable leader has suggested.
This subsection, which I feel is broad enougb,
provides that:
Any person may be appointed Chief Commissioner who is or has been a judge of a superior
court of Canada or of any province of Canada,
or who is a barristerand so forth. Mr. Archibald is a iudge, and
surely he is a barrister.
The proposed amendment means that the
position must be held by a judge of the
Exchequer Court. At the present time a
qualified man is ready to take the job, but
we do not know what may happen in the

SENATE
future. There may be reasons for changing
subsection 2, but I think it is ail right as it
now stands. I have no objection to the bill;
I simply wish to draw to the attention of this
house the fact that the iist of eligibie persons
for this position wili be made arnalier.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Question!
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I do nlot know
that I arn in a position to answer my honourable friend from L'Acadie (Ho0n. Mr. Leger),
but I wouid assume that the Temuneration of
an Exehequer Court judge wouid be greater
than 'that of a judge of any ordinary court in
Nova Scotia.
Hon. Mr. LEGER: I ar n ot objecting to
the increase in sa-lary. Subsection (2) es it
now stands reads as follows:
Any person may be appointed Chief Commissioner who is or bas been a judge of a superior
court of Canada or of any province of Canada,
or who is a barrister or advocate of at ieast
ten years' standing at the bar of any such
province.
Mr. Justice Archibald would corne under this
provision, so, 1 do not see why it is necessary
to narrow it.
Mon. Mr. MURDOCK: The expianatory
note reads as follows:
The purpose cf the amendment is to require
that the office of 'Chief Cominissioner shall be
held -by a judge of the Exchequer Court.
Hon. Mr. LEGER:
I understand the
expianatory note; but I do net like it. As
the subsection now stands there is a large
field from which te choose, but in future,
in-stead of being able to appoint a Chief Cernmissioner from ail the judges and barristers
in Canada, the selection will be limited te a
judge cf the Exchequer Court. This iih
resuit in oniy five men being eligible te hold
this office.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Neyer before has
it been a requisite that the Chief Commissioner of the Raiiway Commission be a judge.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Honour'able senators, as my honourable friend from L'Acadie
(Hon. Mr. Leger) has said, the panel from
which the Chief Commîssioner can be drawn
is limited.
Hon
me for
to the
set eut

Mr. MURDOCK: If you wiil pardon
speaking again, I would cail attention
language of the present Act, which, is
in the exp]anatory note.

Hon. Mr. QUINN: We know that.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: This is how it
reads:
Any person may be appointed Chief Commis8ioner who is or bas been a judge cf a superior

court of Canada or cf any province of Canada,
or who is a barrister or advecate of at ieast ten
years' standing at the bar cf any such province.
Then the note stat-es:
The purpose cf the ameodmnent is te require
that the office cf Chief Comamissioner shall be
held by a judge cf the Exehequer 'Court.
Hfon. Mr. HAIG: In ether words, the choice
is limited te five persons.
Hon. Mr. LEGER:
ebjecting te.

That is what I amn

lion. Mr. HAIG: But those five are judges.
Apparently the government desires te make
lawyers ineligible.
Hon. Mr. LEGER: I do net like that.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Honourable senaters, I
thînk I see som-e reasons for tbe government's
proposai. On iooking baek over the record, it
%vould be found that several of the former
outstanding chairmen cf the board were
eminent iudges. Fer example, I very well
remember whien Mr. Justice Mabee was chairman. Then there was Mr. Justice Killam.
Hon. Mr. COPP: Mr. Justice McKeown
was another able chairman.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Yes. Their court experience wns useful te them on the board. But
yen couid net get a judgc te accept the posilion ncw unless hie was retired and in receipt
of a pension, or wns willing te risk being
retired without pension aiter seýrving on the
buard for ten years. I have hiad the great
pleasure of meeting Mr. Justice Archibald,
though I did net discuss this matter with hirn.
I doubt if any judge in my province would
have taken the position unless his pension
rights had been protected. A few years ago
a Manitoba judge was made an ambassador,
but he remained on the Bench until a special
statute granted him superannuation privileges.
Some years eariier the late. Mr. Justice Fullerton, anether of our able judges, agreed te
hecome Chairman cf the b~oard on condition
that parliament wvuId pass an Act authorizing
payment cf bis judiciai pension after the
expiry cf bis term as Chief Commissioner.
Hon. Mr. QUiNN: And the full period cf
bis service on the board was counted for pensien purposes.

Hon. Mr. HAIG: Yes.
1 think the appointment cf a judge under

the provisions cf this bill ia a forward step,
It may be asked why none but Excheque r
Court judges are te be eligible for appoint-

ment.

I doubt if a superior court judge could

be spared from any cf the provinces at
preserit. On the Court cf King's Beach in
Manitoba, for instance, there are six judges,

JUNE 17, 1948
and ail are needed. If one was borrowed for
the Transport Board an additional judge
would have to be appointed to that Bench.
In Ontario and Quebec it is said that there
are not enough judges to handle all the existing legislation. While I agree with my honourable friend from L'Acadie that if this bill
is passed we may run into difficulty, I think
it is better to take that chance and to make

603

a further amendment of the Act later on, if
necessary, than to keep the field of possible
appointees as wide as it is at present. Therefore I personally support the bil.
the

tiw

REVISED STATUTES 0F CANADA BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. WISHART McL. ROBERTSON moved
the second reading -of Bill 348, an Act respecting The Revised Statutes of Canada.
He said: Honourable senators, the purpose
of this bill is to establish a statute revision
commission, to consist of the Minister of
Justice, the Solicitor General, and five coin,
missioners appointed by the Governor in
Council. Previous consolidations of the statutes were made in 1886, 1906 and 1927, and it
is felt that there should bie an early stnrt on
the task of once again bringing the statutes
Up to date.
The procedure to be followed will be the
samne as on previous occasions, and the termis
of this bill are substantially the saine as those
of previous measures for the saine purpose.
The bill sets out the extent of the authority
granted to thie commission to alter the atatutes.
This is to ensure that only improvements in
drafting are made and that no changes of
substance--which. should be made only by
parliament-are introduced.
The commission is authorized to engage sucb
professional and other assistance as it deems
necesaary, at remuneration to bie fixed by the
Governor in Council. Civil servants also, with
the approval of the minister, may be tmployed
to assist the commission -and may be paid for
their services.
Hon. JOHN T. HAIG: I am very glad that
thia bill has been introduced. As a member of
the legal profession, I have found great difficulty in tracing changes in the statutes in
order to ascertain. the existîng state of the Iaw.
It is necessary to have on one's shelves alI the
federni statutes fromn 1927 to date, and Vo hunt
through them ail to see what amendments
Sometimes the subjeet
have been made.
inquired into is not very important; nevertheless, the necessary research is quite a task

SENATE

For some time it has been the practice to
revise tbe provincial statutes of Manitoba
every ten years. It is now twenty-one years
since the last revision of the Dominion statutes,
and I arn very glad that this work is being
undertaken.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the second time.

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON moved the second
reading of Bill 195, an Act to provide for the
Investigation, Conciliation and Settlement of
Industrial Disputes.
He said: I bave asked the honourable
s"enator from Toronto-Trinity
(Hon. Mr.
Roebuck) to explain this bill.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Have we the bill?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: The bill, with
some explanatory notes and additions, is here.
Hon. ARTHUR W. ROEBUCK: Honourable
senators, this is an important piece of legislation: not that, it breaks new ground, but that
it affects so many people in such a vital way;
not that there is anything particularly new
about it, although there are somo new sections,
but because it is ;the culmination of a ve.ry
long experience in industrial relations and the
climax of much thoughit and considerable
wisdomn in these matters.
The bill directly affects only t.hose industries under dominion .iurisdiction. Parliament
in this matter, asz in ail others, is confined to
those subjeets placed under dominion control
by section 91 of the British North America
Act. Accordingly, the direct application of
the bill is to such industries as shipping and
railways-whicb employ large numbers of
people-and to aeronautics and the other
industries mentioned.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Will the honourable senator perfitit a question at this point? Is there
provision whereby a province may adopt and
apply the Act to ail of its industries.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: Oh, yes. I shaîl come
to the answer to that question immediately.
I estimate that the number of employees who
would be directly affected by the Act is
approximately 300,000.
The minister bas
authority to enter into an agreement witb the
government of any province to administer
legisiation of that province whicb is substantial uniform with this measure, and to pay the
cost of administration. That is te say. if a
province passes an Act which is substantially

the same as this Act, or if it does wbat I
understand Ontario bas donc, and adopts the
act as set out here, then tbe two governments may agree that the provincial Act be
administered by the Minister of Labour of
Canada, and the cost of administration will
be paid out of the Consolidated Revenue
Fund of the dominion.
This is by no means an empty gesture, as
the province of Ontario has already passed
legislation of tbe irind, which will come into
force upon proclamation, after the passing of
this Act.
The province of Alberta bas
already adopted its provisions for application
to tbe disputes in i.ts coal mining industry. A
province may apply the termas of thiýs Act to
its industry either in whole or in part.
It is hoped that, as a resuit of the development whicb I tbink will follow, we may achieve
something in the way of uni'form labour
legislation in aIl .iurisdictions tbroughout
Canada.
The importance of this may be
judged by tbe fact, that approximately a
million and a baif employee-s might be affected
by these provisions. Ou the books of the
Unemployment Insurance Commission there
are enrolled more than one and a haîf million
employees; and some 700,000 Canadian men
aud women belong to labour unions. Su in
legizlation of this kind we are touching
miatters of great import to business, to finance,
and, above ail, to human relations.
This Ineasure, as I have said, is the result
of a very long experience, stcmming from the
organization of the Departmen. of Labour and
the passing of the Conciliation Act, away back
in 1907-more than forty years ago-and as
woll the so-callod Lemieux Act, which is the
preseut Industrial Disputes Investigation Act.
And of course wve had wonderful experience
during the recent vwar, when there wvas great
necessity that industry be kept goiog so that
production be maintained and indeed increased.
Old ideas went by the board, and thus 'vo had
the Wartime Labour Regulations, which, as
honoîîrahle senatnrs know, were enactcd by
P.C. 1003. The presont bill is largcly a reenactment of those regulations, wbich it repeals along with the Industrini Disputes Investigation Act.
The mature experience ont of wbich this
bill arises migbt be clasýsîied under a number
of beadings. For instance, there bave been
tbe Labour Department's efforts over tbe years
to conciliate in labour relations, botb before
disputes arise and wbile tbey are in progress.
That branch of the civil service devoted to
this work has, over the years, gained much
knowledge of men and conditions and of bow
to bring about barmony and co-operation
between labour and management to the bene-

JUNE 21, 1948
fit of each and of the public as well. Also,
there has been the experience gained in the
administration of the Industrial Disputes
Investigation Act. Next, there was the very
valuable experience under the Wartime Labour
Regulations. .And, finally, we have been able
to profit from the experience of other countries,
particularly the United States and Great
Britain. Some of the regrettable experiences
of the United States have been as good
teachers as their happy experiences.
The general purpose of this bill, which incorporates this vast experience, is to substitute
reason for force in the industrial struggle. It
is to resolve the clash of conflicting interests
by mutual concessions, to promote understanding by discussion and negotiation, and
thus to achieve co-operation where interests
coincide rather than destructive action where
they diverge. In short, the purpose is to
replace industrial warfare by harmony, cooperation and good will. This object is good,
and, in my judgment, the methods adopted to
achieve it are admirable.
Honourable members will observe that the
bill is in two parts, the first part running from
sections 1 to 52, and the second part from
sections 53 to 74. Generally speaking, the first
part defines and prohibits what are designated
unfair labour practices. Let me point out the
effort which is obvious in the bill, to make
the measure fair as between employer and
employee. One cannot read the bill without
being impressed with the endeavour to hold
the balance even. There has been no time
when a bill such as this could have been
brought forward more advantageously than
at present. We have enjoyed a considerable
period of comparative prosperity. Our labour
force has been kept at fairly full employment and at reasonably good wages; at the
same time employers, notwithstanding some
complaints as to high wages, have been doing
very well. The result is that the parties are
happy. In my judgment there are not today
the antagonism and anger which, as honourable members will remember, prevailed in days
gone by when the stress and strain of living
were greater than now, when unemployment
and poverty were common. This is the time, if
there ever was one, for a thoughtful, kindly
and co-operative spirit in considering legislation of this kind.
Part I of the bill provides for certification
of unions and of employers' organizations as
bargaining agents. It also provides for the
negotiation of collective agreements, and for
the enforcing of agreements and of the Act.
Part Il states the application of the Act,
to which I have already referred, and provides

607

for a representative Labour Relations Board,
such as was found necessary during the war.
I turn first to the definitions in section 2.
"Collective bargaining" is defined in paragraph
(e). Under the present regulations persons
selected by the union or elected by a majority
of the employees are named as the bargaining
agents for the union. It is now intended that
the union itself be the bargaining agent, which
will act in the ordinary way through the officers
of the union. Responsibility will rest with the
union itself and the membership will have some
method of enforcing its will on the men who
represent it.

Hon. Mr. EULER: Does that mean the
local union or the controlling body?
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: It is the union
named as the bargining agent for the unit. The
Labour Relations Board defines what it calls
a bargaining unit, which may be a single factory, a nation-wide industry, an operation confined to one province, or a unit of some other
description. The union named as the bargaining agent must have in its membership more
than fifty per cent of the employees of that
unit. It is therefore a particular group of
employees.
Hon. Mr. DAVIES: Or is it an international
union with headquarters in the United States?
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: The international
union would have nothing to do with it, except
perhaps to discuss a matter with the members
in a particular district. The local officers of
a particular unit of employees would be the
bargaining agents. That is as it has operated
in the past, and I have no doubt it will continue in the future. I may add that this democratic system is approved by both employer
and employee organizations. It makes for
greater responsibility and flexibility, and I
hope will abolish some of the abuses under the
old system.
Paragraph (d) of subsection 1 of section 2
has to do with "collective agreements". In
Ontario, the law respecting collective agree-

ments is not enforceable as such, but the effect
of this measure is that the employer incorporates the termas of the collective agreement
by implication, if not directly, in his agreement with the employee, and therefore the
collective agreement becomes enforceable by
the employee against the employer individually
and by the employer against the employee
individually.
Paragraph (e) defines "collective bargaining," and should be read together with sections
14 (a) and 16 (a,) where it is provided that the
parties, when required to negotiate, "shaîl
make every reasonable effort to conclude an
agreement."

SENATE

Paragraph (i) defines "employees." When the
bill reaches committee there may be some
discussion as to this paragraph because those
excluded from the application of the Act are
not within the definition of "employees". All
persons exercising any managerial function are
All
excluded, irrespective of their title.
superintendents, foremen and others exercising managerial functions are not "employees" as defined by the bill. Also excluded
are
from the definition of "employee"
those employed in a confidential capacity in
matters relating to labour relations. Under
the present regulations, persons employed in
all kinds of confidential work are excluded
from collective bargaining. The bill limits the
exclusion to those employed confidentially in
matters relating to labour relations. Finally,
there is the exclusion of members of the professions, such as law, medicine and engineering. Considerable effort has been made by
employed
engineers to have
themselves
included under this measure. They are
excluded at the moment because the profession is divided within itself, and because the
organized part of the profession stands
against it. The problem will solve itself in
the course of time, I hope, and employed
engineers will be included and will enjoy the
benefits under this legislation.
Section 3 of the bill declares the right of
both employees and employers to become
members of their respective organizations and
to participate in the activities thereof.
Section 4 makes it illegal for an employer to
interfere in the formation or administration of
a trade union, or to contribute financially or
otherwise

to the union's support.

It

makes,

however, three very important exceptions. The
first is to permit the employee to attend to
union business during working hours; the
second, to permit the employer to furnish the
employee with free transportation when engaged on what is really the joint business of
the two parties, but which may be primarily
the union's business. For many years railroad
companies have provided free transportation
to menbers of the negotiating and organizing
committees of their unions. The third exception allows a union, of course with the consent of the employer, to use the premises of
the employer for union purposes. Apart from
those exceptions, the employer must not participate in or interfere with either the organization or the maintenance of the union: it
must not contribute to the union's support,
and certainly it must not dominate the union.
Subsection 2 of section 4 prohibits discrimination by an employer against members
of a union either in hiring or in tenure of
employment; paragraph (b) prohibits what is

sometimes picturesquely referred to as a
"yellow dog" agreement, that is to say an
undertaking in the hiring agreement by the
employee not to belong to a union. The
employee should be free to belong to a union
if he wants to.
Subsection 3 prohibits an employer from
intimidating an employee to prevent him
from becoming, or to compel him to cease to
be, a member, officer or representative of a
trade union; and it prohibits any other person
from compelling an employee to become, or
to refrain from becoming, or to cease to be,
a member of a trade union. Undoubtedly
what is desired is the greatest possible freedom in these matters.
Subsection 4 saves the right of the employer to terminate, for proper and sufficient
cause, the services of an employee.
Section 5 protects the employer from
attempts by labour to organize the employer's
staff in his time and on his premises. Unless
with the consent of the employer, such activitics constitute an offence under this act.
Section 7 provides for collective bargaining.
If a union has over 50 per cent of its members
in good standing-which means that they have
paid their dues-it can be certified as the bargaining agent of the employees in the unit.
Under P.C. 1003 certification was permitted if
the union could produce documents which
were declared by it tn be authorizations of
50 per cent of the employees within the unit.
That method was subject to abuse, and has
been found unsatisfactory. It was too easy to
gather up these little pieces of paper. So.
under this bill a majority of the employees
m-ust be union members in good standing;
and it is the duty of the board which grants
certification to assure itself that such is the
fact.
The
Section 9 deals witlh certification.
Labour Relations Board has authority to
define appropriate bargaining units and to
certify a union as the bargaining agent. You
may notice the sting in the tail of that particular section; no union influenced by an
employer to the point that its fitness for bargaining is impaired, or that is dominated by
an employer, shall be certified as a bargaining
agent of employees. Where there are competing unions, there are provisions for taking
a secret vote of the employees to decide which
organization they desire to present their case
and represent them in bargaining negotiations.
A new provision gives the board the right
to cancel a certification when it becomes convinced that the bargaining agent no longer
properly represents the employees of the

JIJNE 21, 1948
union. In that event the usuai procedure for
the appointing of another agent would be
followed.
While the certification continues valid, that
is before it is cancelled or expires, the union
has exclusive authority to 'bargain collectively
on behaîf of the employees of the unit and,
what is most important, to bind the employees by its agreement. Those who have
had experience in the running of business will
recognize the great advantage to an employer
of knowing with certainty with whom he is to
deal. It is of equal value to the employee to
know who his representatives are and to
understand the very text of the agreement by
which he is bound.
In the interests of fins.lity, as soon as the
bargaining agreement has actually been certified there is read into every such agreementunless it is put there by the drafters--a clause
providing for arbitration of aIl differences
arising out of the agreement, its interpretation
and its administration during its termi.
Hon. Mr. EULER: I take it that there is
no provision for the closed shop; but there
may be a union in a shop and also employees
who do not belong to the union. Are these
employees stili at liberty to make a separate
contract with the employers?
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: No they are not.
That would divide the two sections into warring groups.
Hon. Mr. EULER: That is, the non-union
employees must accept the decision of the
bargaining agent?
Hon. Mr. ROEBIJCK: Yes. The bargaining agent is the representative of non-union
employees as well as of union employees. The
bargaining agent represents everyone wîtbîn
the unit.
Hon. Mr. EULER: Do those employees
then have to adopt what is known as the
Rand formula: that those who are not members of the union must contribute to the
union?
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: Not at all. The
Rand formula, which waz developed in connection with the Ford strike, is based upon
the fairly sound philosophy that aIl employees
who gain benefit fromn the activities of a union
should pay for it. There is no attempt in this
bill, not even the slightest, to enter into that
field of controversy. It was necessary to
appoint a bargaining agent in order to have
effective bargaiing. The only way to appoint
a bargaîning agent is to select a representative
who has the consent of at least 50 per cent
of the employees.

Under the new Act, it is not difficult to get
rid of a bargaining agent. Under the former
Act the only way was to promote some other
union within the shop. That meant a fight
between the unions, and I suppose the best
man would win. This was a bad provision,
because the whole purpose and tenor of the
Act is to bring about harmony and to abolish
strikes to the extent that it is possible. If the
members of a union or those outside of it
can convince the board that these representatives are not properly representing them,
and that they do not command the confidence
of fifty per cent of the employees, it is the
duty of the board to dispossess the representatives of their authority and to bring about a
vote of everyone to establish who shall be the
bargaining agent.
Hon. Mr. DAVIES: By fifty per cent do
you mean a majority?
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: Yes.
Hon. Mr. DAVIES: Fifty-one per cent
would be a mai ority.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: Yes.
Hon. Mr. EULER.- Could non-union men
be members of the bargaining body?
Hon,. Mr. ROEBUCK: I would not think
so, because it is the union that is the responsible element in the bargaining certification.
Hon. Mr. EULER: And they are governed
by the decision of the bargaiing body
although they are not members of it?
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: That is rîght. But
if they could show the board that they were
not allowed to be members, or that there was
something improper about the union, I think
it would be the duty of the board to exercise
its discretion.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Suppose the union had
fifty-one per cent of the membership, but a
dispute arose and the board was not sure
whether the union had a majority of not,
could a vote of the whole plant be taken to
see if it had authority?
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: The vote is of the
whole plant. When a vote is taken it is a
vote by everybody.
Hon. Mr. HORNER: What would be the
procedure if fifty-one per cent or more were
non-union members?
Hon. Mr. ROEBUOK: Then the union
could not get certification. If there was no
union commanding fifty per cent of ahi the
emnployees, and there was a desire on the part
of the employees to beconie certified, I have
no doubt that the board couhd make some

SENATE
arrangement
to meet that very unusual
situation.
These collective agreements have a minimum term of one year, so that they never
become a permanent matter nor yet do they
rapidly disappear. They must last at least
one year, except when the board consents to
earlier termination or, under section 10, a new
agent bas been appointed. In this case the
new agent can give two months' notice of
termination.
Sections 12 to 15 set out the obligation of
the parties to negotiate or bargain, and also
set out the procedure. As I have already
quoted, it is set out in the most emphatic
terms that:
They shall make every reasonable effort to
conclude a collective agreement.
The employer must not decrease wages or
alter the terms and conditions of employment,
and the union must not strike until (1) an
agreement has been concluded, (2) a conciliation board has reported and seven days have
elapsed since the making of its report, or the
minister bas advised the parties that it is his
intention not to appoint a conciliation board.
Hon. Mr. EULER: What happens if they
go on strike?
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: Then it comes
under offences. I shall take that up in a few
moments. There are penalties, and although
they are not excessive they are steep enough
to hurt. Anyway, the great bulk of our
employees and employers are desirous of
obeying the law, although sometimes when
tempers are frayed both sides will go to
regrettable lengths. In the main, Canadian
employers and employees are law-abiding,
decent, respectable people.
Either party may at any time request the
services of a conciliation officer. His appointment, as was the case before, is in the discretion of the minister, and the minister may
also act on his own initiative.
It is rather interesting to add up, as was
done in the Industrial Relations Committee
of the other house, just how long it takes
between the initiation of bargaining and the
final conclusion of the process at the point
where the parties may declare a lockout or
go on strike. This is the cooling off period.
Between notice to negotiate given by one
party to the other and the commencement of
bargaining there may be a maximum of
twenty days; for collective bargaining, seven
days; for the conciliation officer to report,
fourteen days; for the appointment of a conciliation board after a report of the conciliation officer, twelve days; for the conciliation

board to report, fourteen days; and, after the
board has reported, a period of seven days.
In other words, this process of negotiation
may be extended to a period of seventy-four
days between the notice to negotiate and the
final liberty to strike or lock out. That is a
pretty good cooling-off period. I suppose that
in some circumstances employees will get
rather
hungry
during that period and
employers will become very impatient of
their offensive and defensive rights. But in
the main, time is a great element in the settling of disputes. Time softens anger and
dissipates animosities; and as the days pass
and people blow off steam they become tired
of discussion and finally reach an agreement.
Where the conciliation officer fails, the
minister has it in his discretion to appoint a
board of conciliation. The minister's discretion bas been increased by tlis bill. The chief
purpose of :the bill is to avoid the loss inseparable from industrial warfare, so strikes and
lockouts are prohibited during the entire ternm
of the agreement as ,well as during the negotiatien of -the agreement. And where the parties
themselves agree to open up some term and to
renegotiate it, the whole paraphernalia of
negotiation must be run through again before
offensive action con be taken by either party.
It is well to know that section 26 preserves
the right of the individiual employee to diseuse
and negotiate with his employer, whetiher in
the presence of union representatives or not.
In other words, he may, if he wishes, be his
own grievance committee.
Conciliation boards consist of three members, two of whom are nominated by the
parties, and the two nominees choose the third,
who becomes the chai.rman of the board.
There are time limits on each one of the
inoves that I have mentioned. Under this Act
the procedure and the powers of the conciliation boards are almost identical with those
under the Industrial Disputes Investigation
Art and the more recent legislation, P.C.
1003. Those provisions are so well known,
so definitely established and so workable, and
have been the subject of so li;ttle controversy,
that. I feel I need not spend time in going
over their details. I suppose that at one time
or another most of us have been members of
conciliation boards. It is a rather delightful
experience to sit and listen to employees and
employers state in the presence of one another
their respective sides of the dispute, and to
watoh them gradually come toegther, as they
usually do, and to see discussion bring barmony where before there was anger, animosity
and lack of co-operation. There is nothing
like the spotlight, open investigation and free
discussion to resolve industrial disagreements.

JUNE 21, 1948
Someone asked me about penalties for violation of the statute. The penalties are flot
excessive. For instance, section 39 fixes a maximum of $5 per employee per day or $250 per
day, whichever is the lesser, for the employer
who alters wages or conditions of employment
before the procedume of negotiation is completed. That fine is by the day and of course
may be lessened, for the maximum penalty is
flot imperative.
lion. Mr. LEGER: And the judge might
fine an employer juÊt for one day.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: Yes. The idea is
noît to terrorize anybodýy,, but to make people
do what they ought to do in order to bring
about harmony.
Section 4 prohibits an employer from interfering in t'he formation or administration of a
trade union and from con'tributing to its funds.
On the ckther hand, .by section 5 -a union is forhidden to organize during working hours
on the employer's premises. The maximum
penalty for in-fraction of these sections is $100
for an individual and $1,000 for a corporation,
einployeT's organization or union. The employer may be ordered to pay back-wages
to employees improperly laid off.> Noncomplian-ce, with a court or board order could
resuI t in a penalty of $50 a day, which I suggest is a modest 8uze in tihe light of what
happened not long ago to one John L. Lewis
for disobeying an order of a aimilar obaracter.
A-n illegal, lockout is.priced at $250 per day to
the employer, and an ililegal strike at $150 per
day 'to the union. These penalties, #hile they
could not be ilaughed. off by an employer or a
union, are not heavy enough to ruin either
Party.
Where no other penalty is provided for
doing something that is prohibited or not doing
something that is required, the fine is $100 if
an individuîal is at ïfault, and $500 if a cor)poration, union or employer's organization is helM
responsible. So far as I can sec, there are no
provisions for j ail sentences. Complaints of
failure to negoitiate may 'be dealt with by an
order of the board requiiring compliance. When
one party to a dispute complains about the
ofher, aill may be called before the board and
told what to, do. And I have no doubit that in
the gi-et mai ority of cases they obey the
order.
Prosecutions can 'be instituted only wiU
the consent of the Minister of Labour. Duriag the war, due largely to the burden of
work upon the minister, this duty waa performed by the board. A prosecution with
which. I am somewhat familiar took place
recently with the board's consent. With the
paseing of those hectic timee of war, the

611

authority to give consent to prosecute goes
into, the hands where it normally belongs,
those of the Minister of Labour. It would be
bad policy in connection with industrial relations to allow anybody, whether employer or
employee, to lay charges against anyone without first obtaining consent. Under this bill
the minister bas authority to withhold his
consent and to attempt to bring about some
ad-justment of the dispute, which is the better
way 'to proceed.
Section 44 of the bill gives the minister the
right to appoint industrial inquiry commissioners, as he has been doing under P.C. 1003.
Commissioners so appointed. are empo-wered
to investigate and report concerning complainte as to, violation of indýustriel. labour
regulatione. Most complaints have been found
to be capable of adjustment. As I said previously, the bull is remed-ial and is designed te,
prevent rows and to resolve industrial disputes without stoppages of work.
Part II of the bill has to do with the application and administration of the measure, to
which I referred in my opening remarks. I
should perbaps add that employees of Crown
companies -are included du the bill, the reason
being the difficulty ini defining the two classes
of Crown companies. There are those companies normally doing goverament business,
and also those engaged in industrial, commercial or business operations. It de desirable
that those engaged in business should be
subject to this legisiation, while those who are
merely substituting for civil employees should
not be included: it is therefore left to be
determined by order in council who shaîl and
who shalI not be included. 1 need not teilI
honourable senators that civil servants of Hie
Majesty in the right of the Dominion, of
Canada are excluded from the provisions, for
the good reason that strikes and lockouts are
methode which should not be adopted by
civil servants. Special provision bas been
made for conciliation among civil servants,
for the hearing and, I hope, the solving of just
grievances. Moreover, if properly understood,
the Government of Canada, the employer, is
a judiciai institution and should hold the
balance as between the employee and, the
Crown.
Hon. Mr. DAVIES: I notice that the Act
applies te employees in industries which. are
within the legisiative authority of parliament
to, regulate, and that these include radio
broadcasting stations. Do radio broadcasting
stations corne under this Act because private
stations pay a licence te, the goverriment>
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: It le my opinion that
not only C.B.C., but alI radio broadcasting

SENATE
stations are included. The British North
America Act gives property and civil rights to
the provinces, so that one would imagine an
agreement between a railway company and its
employees would be as much a matter of
property and civil rights as an agreement hetween a farmer and bis bired man. It is so
understood by lawyers. But the British North
America Act gives to the Dominion jurisdiction
over the business of railways, aeronautics-to
wbich rny friend bas referred-sbipping and
several other things. Tbe relationship of employer and employee bas been ruled by the
Privy Council to be incident-al to the control
of these undertakings and tberefore to be
within the jurisdiction of the Dominion Government. In a special case before the Privy
Council, radio broadcasting was held to be
witbin federal jurisdiction, whether carrîed on
by government agencies or by private com.panies. Employees of private stations would
tberefore be included witbin the provisions of
tbis measure.
Hon. Mr. EULER: I tbink I understood my
friend to say tbat Crown-operated companies
would corne under tbis legisiation. Does that
apply to businesses owned or operated by a
provincial governrnent?
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: No. It refers only to
Crown companies incorporated by federal
action. During the war the provincial goverfiments bad sorne activities carried on by Crown
companies. but these companies would not be
regarded as being witbin the Dominion jurisdiction.
I hope that the power of the minister under
tbis legislation to appoint industrial inquiry
commissioners, and do wbat to hima seems wise,
may be useful in avoiding industrial strife. One
metbod is the promotion of employee-rnanagement committees in îndustry. There are many
otber ways in wbich a minister who is well
inforrned, and bas the staff and will do it,
can bring about barmony and good will between
tbe parties, and settie troublesome matters in
ad'vance of controversy.
Tbis provision gives no new authority, and
1 sbould emphasize that tbe minister is given
no extraordinary powers, sucb as to seize a
plant or take otber drastic action when the
parties do not agree.
Section 58 sets up a Labour Relations Board.
It is to consist of a cbairman and eigbt members--four representatives of employers and
four representatives of employees. Sucb a
board functioned very well during the war as
an instrument of industrial barmony. It may
he of interest to note tbat up to March 31,
1947, the national board certified representatives in 278 cases, rejecting 61; and the pro-

vincial boards certified 3,625 cases, rejecting
574. Exact figures are not important, but the
general figure is, as showing the extent to
whicb this systemn of bargaining bas permeated
our industrial community. -It is a great
success.
The board is clotbed with various powers.
It defines tbe bargaining unit, which. we have
already discussed; it certifies the bargaining
agents; it controls the grievance procedure,
and arbitration. It also deals with complainta
of failure to negotiate or otberwise to observe
tbe provisions of the act. The powers of
the board are set out in section 61; and I
migbt observe that its decisions are not subject to review; tbat is to say, you cannot stop
tbemn by court order. The purpose is not to
make tbe board an autocratie body, but to
assure decisive action; to settîn a question out
of hand and have done with it, rather than
engage in long arguments in courts and elsewhere.
Hon. Mr. HORNER: Part of tbis bill is
copied fromn Saskatehewan labour legislation,
is it not?
Hon.. Mr. ROEBUCK: "Can any good thing
corne out of-" Saskatchewan?
Hon. Mr. HORNER: I do flot like the part
that came mnto this bill.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: I do not know. If
any portion of this bill came from the province
of Saskatchewan, I would not deem it a
virtue, and certainly 1 would not criticize it
on that ground; but if it were copied by the
good province of Saskatcbewan, I would regard
it is a compliment to those wbo drafted this
legislation.
Whetber it cornes fromn or goes

to Sa.skatchewan makes very little difference.
Saskatchewan bas taken or is taking steps to
make use of this legisiation. 1 arn not clear as
to wbat bas been done: perbaps the honourable senator frorn Blaine Lake (Hon. Mr.
Horner) can tell us.

It may be welI to mention sometbing wbich
is not in tbis bill. An attempt was made in
the other place to incorporate a provision for
what is known as the check-off system, wbereby
an employer deducts from the employee's
wages bis union dues and pays tbose dues to
tbe union. It was sougbt to provide that the
e~mployer must do so, but that provision was
deleted in com'mittee. Many of you would
agree to tbe cornmittee's action, but I do not.
I think the result of tbe provision would bave
been a degree of union security whicb would
bave worked out well in the end, besides
relieving the unions of a good deal of bookkeeping wbich the employers migbt well bave

613

JUNE 21, 1948
dane for them, and which, by the way, ini a
very large number of cases the employers are
domng voluntarily. The number of such cases
is very rapidly increasing, and perbaps it was
neot unwise ta avoid the element of compulsion except where it is absalutely essential ta
bring about harmony.
Hon. Mr. LAÇASSE: Under this bill the
check-off is nat compulsory?
Hon. M.r. ROEBUCK: It is flot, but the
employer is at liberty ta do it if he wishes.
There is another provision which, I arn
glad te say, has been deleted. As originally
framed, the bill put a ban on lawyers; and
I would nlot have voted for that provision.
I believe that the members of the profession,
ta which I arn prend ta belong, have a place
ta fill in matters of public concerfi. To deny
an employer or a union the righit ta send a
lawyer ta a hearing befare the board would
have been unnecessary and unwise, as well as,
in my opinion, an insuit ta the legal profes-

sion. That section was knocked out by an
overwbelming vote.
I have nlot covered ail the details of the bitl,
but I have tried ta deal with the important
sections, and I hope I have made the picture
clear enough to, at least, demonstrate the
objecta which it is sought te -attain. They
are, as I said in my opening remarks, the
substitution of reason, good wiIl, common sense
and co-operation for ilI-will, antagonism, anger
and hate, and lack of co-aperation in industrial
matters.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the second time.

JJORD'S DAY BILL
MOTION FOR THIRD READING

Hon. Mr. -ROBERTSON moved the third
reading of Bikt 344, an Act to amnend the Lord's
Day Act.
Hon. ANTOIINE J. LEGER: Honourable
senators, 1I arn enti-rely in accord with the
princile of the bill, but 1 cannot say as mu'ch
for its .form. I should like to make a few
remarks ut this time and then leave it to the
leader of the government (Hon. M-r. Robertson) or the leader of thbe opposition (-Hon. MT.
Haig) to move that the 'bill be referred to
committee of the whole bouse or to a standing
comImittee.
I wi-M state at once wliat changes I suggest.
In the first place, I wourld, repeal entirebr sec-

tien 15 of the Lord's Day Act. Secondly, I
would strike out f-rom Iune 17 of the bill the
words, "in so far as the same is part of the law
of Ont ario"; and after "1859," in tihe lait line,
I wou'ld add: "in so far as the Pariament of
Canada has authority so to do".
Section 15 of the Act -bas been and, if not
repealed, will continue to be the cause of
dispute as to wbicb law is in force in aiay
given province. When tbe Lord's Day Act was
passed New Brunswick bad- pre-.Coniederation
law, which, our court deelared to be repealed
because of somneprovisions in the Lord's Day
Act. The contrary view bas been held, in
Ontario, and'this bill 'bas been introduced for
the purpose of repealing thec two statutes mentioned in section 2. As to the second of these
statutes, an Act to Prevent the Profanation of
the Lord's Day., 1 'think there is no question
at ahl that the Parliament of Canada bas the
right of repeal-, for section 129 of the British
North America Act reads as follows: .
Except as otherwise provided by this Act, ail
laws in force in Canada, Nova Scotia, or New
Brunswick at the Union, and aIl courts of civil
and criminal juriediction, and all legai. commissions, powers, and authoriites, and ali officers,
judicial, administrative, and ministerial, existing therein at the Union, shahl continue in
Ontario, Quebec, NYova Scotia, and New Brunswick respectively, as if the Union had not been
made; subjet nevertheless (except with respect
to such as are enacted by or exist under Acte
of the Parliament of Great Britain or of the
Parliament of the United Kingdom of Gre-at
Britain and Irehand) to be repealed, âbolished,
or altered by the Parliament of Canadaand so forth.
The first statute which section 2 of the bill
seeks to repeal was passed by the Parliament of
Great Britain, and under section 129 of the
British North America Act it has been held
valid and in force in the province of Ontario.
If section 129 applies to criminal law as weII
as to civil law, it seems to me that the Parliament of Canada would have no right to repeal
that statute. Recause that statute bas been
made an exception under the British North
America Act. we would be, as it were, powerless so far as repeal is concerned.
As to the second statute, without question
we have the right of repeal. I would suggest
that we strike out of line 17 the words: "in so
far as the same is part of the law of Ontario".
We know that the statute is part of the haw of
Ontario. That was decided around 1908. In my
younger days I had something to do with the
Lord's Day Act and I know that there is such a
decision. I would not be bohd enough to say
that we have the right to repeal a statute over
which we have no jurisdiction; therefore I
suggest as a second amendment that in line 20,
following the date "1859", we insert the words:
"nso far as the Parliament of Canada han

616

SENATE

authority so to do". Then, if we have the
authority, the statute will be repealed;- if we
have flot, we should flot attempt to repeal it,
for we have no jurisdiction.
Section 15 of the Lord's Day Act, which
preserves the pre-cunfederation statutes, has
been a source of nuisance through ail the years
that the Act has been in operation.
The
explanatory note, which I assert is correct,
raads as follows:
The Lord's Day Act contains ail the important prohibitions contained in these preConfederation statutes sud is, in fact, wider in
scope. It is considered that the preýConfederation statutes are unnecessary.
If these statutes are unnecessary, I would be
in favour of repealing them ail except those
passed by the Parliament of Great Britain and
by law made applicable to any of the
provinces. If 1 remember my history correctly, it was the Constitutional Act of 1791
that brought the laws of England into force
in Ontario. I merely suggest these changes by
way of improving the measure.
Bon. A. K. HUGESSEN: Honourable senstors, I understand that section 2 of the bill
h-as been specifically asked for by the Government of Ontsrio, and I assume that before the
request was made the goveroment satisfied
it-self that the Parliament of Canada was comnpatent to do what it was being asked to do ;
furthar, the faderaI Department of Justice,
undar whose authority this statute is brought
before us, must also have been of the samne
opinion.
Hon. Mr. LEGER: In other words, you are
saying that their opinions are better than
mine.
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: I would not for a
moment makýe ýany such suggestion.
I do
submit, however, that in ail probability this
matter bas been given caraful consideration by
the depsrtment of the Attorney-General for
Ontario and by the federsi Dapartment of
Justice.
Bon. Mr. LEGER: If careful consideration
had been given to the bill, I do not think it
would contain the words, "in an far as the saine
is part of the law of Ontario," hecause the
Privy Council has decided that it is part of the
law of Ontario.
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: Those words may
ba superfluous.
It is perhaps of interest to know just what
the British statute is that is to be rapaaled so
far as the province of Ontario is concerned.
It is a statute of Great Britain, enactcd in the
year 1781. and the preamble reads as follows:
Whereas certain bouses, rooms, or places,
within the P'itias of London or Westminster, or

in the neighbourhood thereof, have of late
frequently been opened for publie entertainment
or amusement upon tbe evening of the Lord's
day, commonly cslled Sunday; and at other
bouses, rncrms, or places, within the said cities,
or in the neigbbourbond thereof, under pretence of inquiring into religions doctrines, and
explsining texts of holy scripture, debstes bave
frequently been beld on the evening of tbe
Lord's day, concerning divers texts of holy
scripture, by persons unlearned and incompetent to expîsin the saine, to the corruption
of good morals, and to the great encouragement
of irreligion snd profaneness;
And here is 'the operative part of the Act.
be it enacted by the King's Most Excellent
Majesty, . . . that, f rom snd after the psssing
of this pre@ent Act, any bouse, room, or other
place, wbich shaîl be opened or used for public
entertsinment or amusement, or for publicly
debatiug on sny subject whstsoevar, upon any
part of the Lord's day, called Sundsy, and to
which persons shýah ha admitted by the psyment
of money, or by tickets sold for money, shaîl
be deamed a d'isorderly bouse or place.
That is the wording of the Act. I thinik the
reason for the insertion in section 2 of the
words "in so far as the saine is part of the
law of Ontario," to which my bonourable friand
objects, arises from the fact that examination of the preamble to this statute shows
that it is clearly confined to certain bouses,
rooms or places within the cities of London
or Westminster.
Therefore it would saema
f0 be clear that the Act was neyer intanded
to apply to the province of Ontario.
Hon. Mr. LEGER: There is no doubt that
wben the statute was originýally paýsad it was
not intended to apply to the province of
Ontario, but the ýConstitutional Acet of 1791 has
made it applicable.
Therefore what the
honourable senator has read froma the preamble do-es not change the situation.
Hon. Mr. CRERAR: It is ton fine a legal
point for me.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I do not know that if.
makes any difference.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: In the light of
the argument on this mattar batwaen members of the lagal fraternity I arn somawhat at
a disadvantage.
Honourable sanators will
recall my intimation givan upon second resding of this bill, that I would be pleased to
follow the customary procedure and refar the
bif to committea, where any pertinent question could be considered.
I have an open mind en the subject under
discussion.
I know that my bonourable
friand fromn L'Acadia (Hon. Mr. Leger) is a
vary faithful studant of legisîstion prasented
to this bouse, snd that he gives to it a great
deal of time sud thougbt. I arn not compe-

617

JUNE 22, 1948
tent to discuss or weigh the relative merits
of the arguments which he has made, but I
would be very happy to refer the bill to
committee, if such be th.e will of the bouse,
ini order that the views of the law officers
of the Crown may be obtained.

DIPLOMATIC SERVICE (SPECIAL)
SUPERANNUATION BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON moved the third
reading of Bill 348, an Act respecting The
Revised statutes of Canada.

Hon. WISHART McL. ROBERTSON
moved second reading of Bill 349, an Act to
amend the Diplomatic Service (Special) Superannuation Act.
He said: Honourable senators will recail
that last year parliament passed an Act providing a pension plan for heads of missions
in the diplomatic service. This bad become
necessary by reason of problems which bad
arisen in respect of appointments to the diplomatic service of men, most of whom bad been
in the employ of other departments of government. Since the passage of the Act some
thirteen heads of missions bave come under
its provisions, and certain weaknesses in its
administration have become evident. The
bill hefore us is designed to rectify these
weaknesses.
The original Act did not provide that a contributor could get bis contributions back if
he retired before be was entitled to pension.
Tbe rigbt of return of contributions is a
standard provision in ahl superannuation
Acts, and it is included in this bill.
Under -the original measure, contributors
who bad been employed as public servants
were given an option as to the salary basîs
on whicb their contributions would be computed. They could take as the basis either
the actual salaries they had received during
their past service, or -tbe salaries they got
when they were appointed to positions in the
Departmen-t of External Affaira. Tbis option
led to certain anomalies, and it is now proposed to establish a single basis for assessing
contributions, na.mely, the actual salaries
beretofore received in the public service.
Finally, provision is made in the bill to
enable those eligible to come under the Act
to elect to remain outside the scbeme on condition that tbey renounce the benefits
that may be dcrived from it. Certain diplomats, prior to appointment to these posts,
qualified for military or judicial pensions. As
the total over-all pension tbey may receive
from ail sources is lîmited, they would be
called upon to make heavy contributions for
the very small pension benefits they wouhd
receive under this Act. It is now proposed
to meet their cases by permitting them te
withdraw from the seheme entirehy.

The motion was agreed to, and the bull wa
read the third -time, and passed.

The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the second time.

Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: 1 support the suggestion that this bill be referred to committee. The reply made by the honourable
gentleman from Inkerman (Hon. Mr. Hugessen) bas not convinced me that the senator
from L'Acadie (Hon. Mr. Leger) is incorrect
in his appreciation of the law. At the moment
I am not prepared to discuss the matter; one
must not argue these things off-band; but I
know that the law of England ivas made the
law of Ontario in. 1791 or 1792, and that,
e,cept in eO far as it bas been repealed, not
by this bouse but by the province of Ontario,
it remains the law of the province. I arn in
a quandary. The argument that the repeal
bas been asked for by the Attorney-General
of Ontario, presumably witb the approval of
tbe Department of Justice, is nlot enough to
satisfy my mind that the proposai is constitutional and that everything is regular. That
is the "appeal to autbority," and I neyer was
much of a hand at bowing to authority
Neither is tbe fact that on one ground th
bill seems to apply only to England con
clusive of the question. It is a problem
wbether we in tbis parliament bave tbe right
to repeal the Act. If we have not, we should
nlot attempt to do so.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I would ask for
leave to withdraw the motion for third
reading.
Tbe Hon. the SPEAKER: Shahl the bonourable gentleman have leave to withdraw his
motion for the third reading of this bill?
Some Hon. SENATORS: Agreed.
The motion was witbdrawn.
REFERRED TO COMMITTE

bill be referred to the Standing Committee

DOMINION ELECTIONS BILL
SECOND

READING

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON moved the second
reading of Bill 198, an Act to amend the
Dominion Elections Act, 1938.
He said: Honourable senators, I have asked
the honourable senator from Cariboo (bon.
Mr. Turgeon) ta explain this bill.
Hon. J. G. TURGEON: Honourable senators, I am going ta take the liberty of reading fromn Han.sard of June 17, 1948, a statement made by the honourable leader of the
opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig). He said:
The Dominion Eleetions Bill is a peculiar
onle, and in my experienee this bouse lias neyer
interfered with the measure because it relates
purely ta the eleetions to the other place.
Accepting these words as advice, it is My
intention to present the various aspects of the
proposed amendments to the Elections Act ini
a purely explanatory way.
The bilI1 is largely a ýclarification of the Elections Act 110w in force, but several of itis
provisions open up new courses of action. To
start right at home in my own prorvince, I
shaîl refer ta the amendment wbich gives ta
Japanese in Canada the right to vote, regardless of any provincial legisiation whiehi now
bars themn from voting in certain portions of
the country.
Another provision contained in the bilil
relates to Indians. To a 1imited extent, Indiana
who took part in the first Great World War
have the right to vote; and following a recommendation of the Joint Committee on Indian
Affairs t.he proposed amendment gives a
similar right to Indians who servect in the
armed forces during the second World War.
In addition, it gives the right to vote to the
wives of Indians who servcd in eitber the
first or the second World War.

The present Act bars fromn voting inmates
of so-called charitable institutions which are
nraintained by provincial governments in provicces where sueb inmates are not allowed te
vote at elections for the Legisîstive Assernbly.
The propused legislation wipes out tbat section and gives tbese people the right to vote,
whether or not tbey have the provincial
franchise.
The bill proposes to simplify the procedure
under which veterans, confinedý ta hospitals
or other institutions hecause of war service,
may vote. Under this Iegislation every possibIé
regulation may be made to enable these mren
or women to vote. A further provision deals
with men and women now on defence service,
and provides that wherever they may happen
to be, if it is humanly possible to reach tbemn
they will be permitted to vote, and their votes
will ibe counted in the electoral district in which
they live.
These are the main provisions of the bilil.
but I may say a word about the Chief Electarai Officer. It is provided that the salary
of the Chieif Electoral Officer shahl he $10,000
per year, and that when he bas retired his
successor shaîl receive a minimum of $8,000 a.nd
a maximum of $1O,000. That, I take it, is an
expression of appreciation of the services
rendered to Canada by the present Chief
Electoral Officer, Mr. Castonguay. I arn glad
ta make that reference now, because while I
was a member of the elections committee of
another place some years ago be was extremely
useful to us. In those days his, remuneration
was very small, and I think the committee had
a good deal to do with his being phaced in bis
present position.
I intend to make a few comments on our
whole electoral position, antd partioularly with
a view to the future. First of ail I amn going to
be critical. I bave in mmnd the fact that, flot
just lately but over a period, of years, at election after election, only a smal percentage of
the total vote bas been cast. We frequently
hear the riticismn that a large number of the
mernbers of another place are minority Tepresentatives. From, time to time recammendatians bave 'been made as to ways and ýmeans of
changing that condition, but I hope to make it
clear that I arn strongly opposed to miany of
those recommendatiýons.
I said that I was going to be critical. I
criticize the old political parties for baving
alhowed public interest in domestie and international affairs to lag. It is truc that, occasionally, interest is aroused as a result of some
serlous development. Well, honourable sellators, today we do flot know just what serious
developments are facing us. I arn more critical
of my own party, the Liberal party, than of

JUNE 22, 1948
the Conservatives, because to a large degree
Liberalism has thrived upon getting the people
to see the desirability of taking power away
from a.uthoritarian states, whether headed- by
kings, princes or barons, or by groupa such as
exist in certain countries today. During the last
few years Liberals have flot been active enough
in making it clear to our people that the
citizens of a democratic country have responsibilities as well as rights.
Lately there has been a good deal of
discussion of conditions in eastern Europe.
Honourable members will recaîl the very
e]oquent remarks of the honourable gentleman
from Inkerman (Hon. Mr. Hugessen) with
respect to Czechoslovakia. I have been deeply
touched by what has taken place in that
country, because less than two years ago I had
the privilege of being there and in Pola.nd as
a member of a body dealing with reconstruction of the devastated areas of eastern Europe.
The violent death of Jan Masaryk shocked the
world not long ago, and we know that Ozechosiovakia no longer has freedom. Its lack of
freedom is most clearly indicated by the fact
that its people cannot vote for whom they
wish. Somae years ago Jan Masaryk's father,
Thomas; Masaryk. first President of the
Republie of Czechoslovakia, said:
Democracy is discussion. States keep alive
only through the ideals whieh gave rise to their
existence.
Among the ideals that gave rise to the existence of democratic countries is the right to
vote. Yet we are permitting conditions so, to
shape themselves that our people do flot care
much whether they cast their votes or flot.
And on what better foundation than indifference to voting can Canada or any other
country build up a totalitarian state-caîl it
communist, socialist or what you will-in which
the people are not given, a choice of candidates
for election to legislative bodies?
It is often said that proportional representation, either in its complete form or in one of its
'iarious aspects, such as the alternative vote,
ieould cure the present bituation in Canada.
In my opinion-and I have tried to give the
matter a little study-it would do no such
thing. The situation in this country will be
cured only if those who are clothed with
constitutional responsibility for the public good
take every possible measure to make the
people see juat what conditions here will be
like, if through lack of interest we suddenly
-wake up to find ourselves in such a position as
Czechoslovakia is in today. I take the liberty
-of addressing that remark directly to honour:able members of this chamber.
Advocates of so-called proportional repre-gentation argue that minorities are entitledi te

019

representation in parliament and in the legislative assemblies. That is true, but only to a
certain degree. Many years ago a great French
political philosopher said that democracy was
the cruelest of ail forms of government, because
the rosiority always, imposed its will on the
miniority. This is a democratic country, and
we must neyer forget that democracy was
introduced here when the people were given the
right to participate in government by voting
at elections.
I shaîl give an illustration to show that the
minority in Canada does not suifer at the
hands of the maj ority. iFor the past forty
years 1 have belonged to western Canada. In
soine ways I may be said to be a double
minority. First, I arn a Roman Catholic, and
second, on my father's side 1 arn of French
Canadian race and culture. Yet in the constituency in which I was elected to the Alberta
Legislative Assernbly in 1913, not twenty families could pronounce my name, because the
people had no knowledge of the French language; further, ninety-five 'per cent of the
people were of the Protestant religion. It is
true that 1 was defeated in the provincial elections in 1921; but at that time there was a
political surge which. swept the country ontside the cities of Edmonton and Calgary into
the coluron of the United Farmers party.
Later, for family reasons, I went to British
Columbia, and in 1935 was elected to the
House of Gommons in a district which was at
least eight-five or ninety per cent Protestant.
I represented that district until 1945,. when
another surge of political thought swept that
part of the province away from the Liberals
and Conservatives, both federally and provincially, and placed it in the column of another
party.
Ilgive that illustration in answer to the dlaim
that democracy subjects minorities to impositions by mai orities. So for as my experience
and belief goes, that dlaim is not truc. I do
not think any .forma of proportional. representation will remedy the evil that is developing among us of lack of interest, on ection days, in the problems that confront us.
There must be parties rather than individual
candidates. Under the system of proportional
representation there is hiable to be a complete
conflict of parties, resulting in the eventual
extinction of ail but one-and then we will
have the condition that Czechoslovakia has
today.
I have znuch pleasure in urging this house to
give second reading to the bill.
Hlon. JOHN T. HAIG: Honourable senators, I cannot go ahl the way with my friend
the previous speaker. I believe that I arn the

SENATE

onlýy person in this chamber who has been
elected under a systemn of proportional representation.
Hon. Mr. HOWARD: I hope that you will
always be the only member so elected.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I was elected four times
under that system. Before I launch into my
main speech I wish to say that I do nlot advocate proportional representation.
It is the
most archaic systema that one can imagine.
The principle underlying it is that minorities
should be represented in elective bodies. Al
the systemn does is transfer to the chamber of
parliament the tal'k that should have taken
place before the election ini public meetings
and on the hustings.
I speak with some authority on this matter,
because the systema bas been in use in Manitoba since 1920. This is the way it operates in
the city of Winnipeg. The city at large eleets
ten representatives, eonsisting of, say, three
Conservatives, three Liberals, three C.C.Fers
and one other. The tenth representative would
be-if I may use perhaps an unparliamentary
expresson-a mugwump who had some fool
ideas and was elected more as a joke than
anything else. It is wcll known that under the
system of proportional representation a candidate can be elected even though he lias committed murder. Nobody who understands the
system or bas been elected under it bas ever
It is completely
advocated its adoption.
undemocratic.
The .democratic principle in elections is that
a candidate who is elected for a constituency
shail have a majority of the electors voting for
him. Manitoba lias the single transferable
vote. In our conventions a hundred delegates
assemble to elect a candidate froma three
nominees. On the first ballot one gets forty
votes, another thirty-five and the third twentyfive. ýNobody bas a clear majority, so the low
man is dropped, and we vote ail around
again, and somebody gets a majority. That
is the single transferable vote. Manitoba lias
had that system since 1920, and it is s0 universally popular in that province that it is neyer
The system is also used in

Alberta. No one elected to any parliamentary
body in these two provinces is opposed to the
single transferable vote.
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: When the honourable senator wvas il'lustrating the method of
voting he said that the low man was dropped
and the delegates voted ail around again.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Yes.
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: As I understand it
you then vote on number two ballot.

Hon. Mr. HA'IG: I am talking about conventions now.
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: My friend is talking
about the single transferable vote.
Hon. Mr. H-AIG: Yes
For instance, an
election is to take place in my honourable
friend's constituency, a convention is beld and
three names are put up. The ballots are
passed around among the delegates and each
one indicates bis choice. I know that is the
way we do it at conventions of the Progressive
Conservative party, and I should think that
the 'Liberal party was at least democratic. The
resuits of the first ballot are, we will say,
forty votes for the flrst candidate, thirty-five
for the second, and twenty-five for the third.
You drop the low man and vote ail around
again. That practice was followed in Pontiac
the other day.
Hon. Mr. EULER: Also in Newfoundland
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Yes. Nohody got a
majority in Newfoundland, and there is going
to, le a second ballot.
This is the way the single transferable vot(e
wvorks in Manitoba. Three candidates arc put
up, a Liheral. a Progressive Conservative and
a C.C.F.'er. W'hen I go to the poli I decide

people argue tbat that is not how the system
works: they say that veben Liberals mark

for Conservatives, they will vote C.C.F.; or
that Conservatives admit in theory that

JUNE 22, 1948
Liberal candidates shouild have the benefit of
the option, but in fact it is given to the
C.C.F. Let me state emphatically that people
do flot act that way. Here is an illustration
of how second-choice voting operates. In an
election te the school board in December,
1946, one young candidate got 13,800 firstehoice votes. He happened te be a Conservative. A C.C.F. candidate received 6,000, and
a third candidate, who happened to be a
Liberal, got 4,000 votes. There were two
vacancies. It became necessary to go through
the 13,000 votes and find out how many were
second choices.
The successful candidate
needed 8,000 votes. It is not necessary to go
into details; the principle of proportional.
representation does net really enter into, the
matter.
Hon. Mr. EULER: Was this a school board
eleetion?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Yes.
Hon. Mr. EULER: Do the people of Winnipeg practise party polities in school board
elections?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: No. Let me tell the
honourable member from. Waterloo that we
in Manitoba are not so stupid as lis question
would indicate.
Hon. Mr. EULER: I was not making any
charges.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I repent that we in Manitoba are flot stupid. Conservatives would
rather have a Liberal in office than a member
of the C.C.F., and the Liberals prefer a Conservative to a C.C.F. candidate.
lion. Mr. EULER: I did not suppose that
school board eleetions were mun on a party
basis.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: It is not a question of
party. I merely use this incident as an illustration. In the case of the Lîberal candidate,
on the second ballot 5,900 of the 6,000 votes
for the candidate who had oceupied third place
were cast by Conservatives, and he came in
away ahead -of theC.C.F. nominee. Since that
system has been operating in Winnipeg the
C.C.F. have neyer elected a single candidate to
the city council or to the sehool board. They
cannot do it.
Hon. Mr. TURGEON: Is the honourable
senator in favour -of making transferable voting
compulsory?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I would make ahl voting
compulsory. Probably I have said enough on
the subject of the transferable vote, but I
think it would be well if each of us would
consider this matter as of personal application.

Whetber you are a Liberal or a Conservative
you believe in free enterprise. On the one
band we have a systema under which, subject te
reasonable conditions, everybody has a chance.
Opposed to the principle of free enterprise is
the philosophy of socialism. I do not came
what the socialist leaders in this country say
about it; inevitably it leads to absolute control. It cannot lead anywhere else. The
founders of socialism. made state control the
basis of their teachings. Now, what happened
at Oshawa the other day? Nearly 16,000
voters, including 8,300 Liberals and 7,500 Progressive-Conservatives,
showed
themselves
opposed to socialism, yet -a socialist candidate
who polled only 10,300 votes was elected. That
is not democracy; it is control 'by a minority.
When I was a boy of about seventeen or
eighteen there was a convention in the rural
Manitoba constituency where my father was a
farmer. My father was quitie an active worker.
lie wanted to nominate a man named Fenwick. Another man named Hicks wanted to
mun. At the convention both Hicks and Fenwick were nominated One of the delegates
wh'o supported. Hicks and was opposed te
I'enwick nominated a third candidate from the
district where Fenwick. lived, with the resuit
that the Fenwick vote was divided, and Hicks
was returned by a minority vote representing
not more than forty out of one hundred. In
those days there was no provision to drop the
name of the lùw man, and, as I said, Hicks
got in.
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: I should like to ask
a question in connection with the remark of
the honourable senator from Caribon (Hon.
Mr. Turgeon) as to making the alternative
vote eompulsory.
Do I understand the
principle of the compulsory vote to mean that
an elector must indicate his choice of each
candidate on the ballot, or will his vote be
good if he makes only one selection?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I arn not contending for
compulsory voting to make the single transferable vote a success. That reference was
made incidentally, in relation to a question
asked by the honourable member from,
Cariboo. Under the system used in Manitoba
and Alberta you can vote for twe candidates
or just one, as you prefer. I -arn not seeking
to make two changes at once. Wbat I arn
concernied with at the moment is te avoid
the kind of thing which happened at Oshawa.
Nolbody can tell me that under a systema of
alternate voting the Conservative would have
been at the bottom cf the poli. In Manitoba
perhaps 15 per cent cf the voters are plumpers;
in some areas the proportion may be as higb
as 20 per cent; but around 80 per cent of the

SENATE

people vote for the Liberal or the Conservative candidate. In the light of our experience
I arn sure that, had the systema been in effect
at Oshawa, the Liberal candidate, flot the
C.C.F. nominee, would have been the member
today.
Or consider what happened at Prince Albert
at the ]ast federal election, when the Prime
Minister of this country was beaten by 130
votes. Do you mean to tell me that if the
name of the Progressive-Conservative candidate had been dropped, and bis poil of 2,700
votes bad been applied to the other candidates,
the Prime Minister would flot have been
returned? I admit that the vote would have
been reduced by the 10 to 20 per cent who
would flot have voted at ail; but the resuit
could flot be in doubt. When a system of voting has been operating for twenty-eight years,
people know something about it. I realized
when I was elected to the legisiature that a
good many Liberals had voted for me.
Hon. Mr. HOWDEN: May I ask the honourabie leader of the opposition to explain
what occurred on one occasion, which he
probab]y wilI recali, at an election in our
riding of St. Boniface? I believe the Liberal
candidate had a plurality of 600 votes, but hewas afterwards counted out, through the operation of second-choice votes, by a C.C.F.
candidate.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: If I rineîmhrr
there wpre two or three candidates.

righitly,

Hon. Mr. HOWDEN: Threc.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: No; more than three.
There may have
Hon. Mr. HOWDEN:
been four, but certainiy not more. The Liberal
candidate had a plurality of 600 by firstchoice votes, and he was counted out througb
second-cboice votes.
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: Did the C.C.F. man
get in?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: The C.C.F. candidate was
Ted Lawrence.
Hon. Mr. HOWDEN:
Joe Bernier ran?

Was that the time

Hon. Mr. HAIG: I don't think Bernier was
running on that occasion. Dernier ran once or
twice, and later on he was eiected.
But
although some aliowance must be made for
local conditions, the underiying principie is
clear.
Let us suppose that under the systemn of
the transferable vote two candidates, one a
Liberal and one a Conservative, are nominated.
The Liberai, though a strong man, is disliked
by the Liberals, and the Conservative is

disliked by Conservatives. Whom will you
vote for? Generally, the more independent

man is the one you wiil pick.
Hon. Mr. HOWDEN-': How do you neutralize those first 600 votes?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I cannot remember.
I
was flot paying much attention, because I
w'as running myseif and was quite interested
in the city of Winnipeg.
I have said enough about the transferable
vote, but there are one or two other suggestions that I should like to make. Unless the
ordinary people of this country take more
interest in voting, Canada is going to have
a continuation of its present difficulties.
I
read in the Ottawa Journal that in Ottawa
South 10,000 fewer people voted on June
7, which was the date of the Ontario provincial elections, titan voted in 1945. The samne
report disclosed that in Rockcliffe. of ail places.
not ev-en fifty per cent of the people voted.
That is a disastrous situation . A friend of
mine voted in the Forest Hill Village district of Tojonto. The voters iist contained
640 namnes, and there were no labour votes.
The poils were ta close at seven o'clock, but
at a quarter to six only 340 people had voted.
If that sort of thing is going to contintie, as
my honourable friend from Cariboo (Hon.
Mr. Turgcon) lias said, the Czechoslovakia
situation is going to be macle possible in this
country. Canadians have got to take a greater
interes4 in ciections. and it is for that reason
that I suiggestcd compulsory voting.
W hy should people not be compclled to go
out and vote? Many people say, "Oh. well.
politicians are ahl crooked, and I won't v ote
for any of them." But by not voting, these
people make it possible for politicians to be
crooked. From mv experience iii many elections, I believe that sometbing lias to be
done to make people realize that the sacrifices whichi our boyvs and girls made in two
world wars, to keep freedom alive in Canada,
are not to be careiessly thrown away.
In order ta get out the vote, a candidate
must first canvass and organize. This work,
involves the greatest part of the cost of munning an election. I think I could get myseif
elected in any constituency in Winnipeg if
the other fellow ailowed me ta canvass for
votes and get people t.o the polls, whiie he
.iust sat around and did nothing. Any member
of parliament, could get elected in that way. A
full-page election ad in a newspaper costs
approximately $800, I think. The honourable
senator from St. Boniface (lion. Mr. Howden)

wouid know.

A person with a sessional. in-

demnity of $2,000 a year cannot publish many
such ads.

JUNE 22, 1948
Hon. Mr. NICOL: Does the honourable
senator know that in Switzerland, which is a
great democratic country, the vote is obligatory
and is taken on a Sunday? It is the duty of
the people to vote.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: It is in Australia too.
Ilonotirable senators, let uqs turu to the
problemn that will face us in the next federal
election. It makes no0 difference tu the members of this house whether a C.C.P., Liberal, or
Progressive Conservative government is in
power, but it does make a difference to
Canad.a's future if we do not believe in the
system used. I would not criticize the 00CF.
pax'by if I beLieved in theïr philosophy; but
I do not. I have no use for it. Personally, of
course, I would like to see a Progressive Conservative government in 'Canada, but I have
flot lost any slaep during the past thirteen
years just because a Liberal goverrnent bas
been in power. I do flot ag-ree withi some of
their ways of doing tbings. but 1 still beliave in
their philosophy: the freadom, of the people.
The next faderai election will be a crucial one.
We are confronted by dificuit problems, the
tliree maj-or issues being high taxation, the
highi cest cf living. and the shortage of bouses
-cr, if you like, the high cost of housing.
The C.C.F. party has said that the other
parties have lest thejr grip. The reason is that
the people did net vote. As I have said, in the
Village of Forest Hill and in Rockcliffe only
baîf the people votad, and in South Ottawa
only about a quarter cf them did go.
Hlon. Mr. HOWARD: And in Vancouver
Ce ntre.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Yes, only about baîýf the
people voted, in Vancouver Centre. I venture
to say that in a 'by-alection in the city of
Winnipeg it would be every bit as bad.* I
want oui people to be aroused to the seriousness cf the situation. I should like the transferable vote te be put into affect, sc that a
mian or woman elected te the House of Comnions would represent the rnajority of bis or
bier constituents. If the majority want socialism, then we shaîl bave it; but we must be
sure that the majority want it. I do net
believe that for many years to corne- the
peuple -of this country will, vote for socialism.
I knoiw soe will say that Censarvatives would
not vote for Liberais anid tbat Lîberals would
net vote for Consarvatives, but I disagrea.
After the peeple have become accustomed to
a demeecratie system of veting, in one or two
alections, this attitude wou'ld pass away just as
it bas in Winnipeg.
Honourable senators, I am gl.ad te sea tbis
bill. I hope that at tha naxt session of parkianment the Govannime'nt of Canada will bring in
5853-41

623

the transferable vote. I would ask aacb mainber of this beuse to study this proklem, and to,
talk -with marnbers cf the otber bouse from
the previncas of Manitoba and British Columbia, wbere tbey bave coalition govarnments,
and witb the memrýb-ers from Alberta. I suggest that at the next session of parliament tbe
Sanate shouild urge tbe Housa cf Commons te
adopt a democratic systern of veting. Tba
praseint systamn was alhl rigbt in the old days
wben thare were only twe parties in Canada,
but now that thera are tbree or perbaps four
distinct parties it is no longer suitable. A day
or two from new thera will ba an elýection in
Saskatcbewan, wbeie at timas, in 8-ema constituencies, there are as many as four parties. It
was a big tbing for that province wban the
Liberals suggasted the transfarabia vote. The
governmant of the day there did net want it.
If such a systein of voting is proposed next
year in the Huse ef Com-mons, just watcb
wbara the "anti" votes cerne from.
Hon. T. A. CRERAR: Honouiable senators,
se far as time is concerned my contribution
to tbis debate will flot be extensive. Thare
ara, bowevar, a few observatiens that I sbould
lika to make.
In the first place, I tbink t-hat the responsibility of this bouse for examination cf an
alection bill is the same as its responsibility
for the examination cf any other measure
that comas before paîliament. Tbe fact thae
w- are an appointed rather tban an elect-ed
body doas net, in my opinion, relieve us cf
that ganeral respensibility. For instance, if
tbrougb soe influence or other an altogather
unjust franchise measura sbould at some time
pass tbrougb tbe ether bouse and be sent te
us for our approval, ive could net wasb our
bands cf it and say it is none cf our affair.
At any rate. we sbould not.
In tbe second place, I sbould like te express
my warm approval cf tbe gift cf tbe franchise
te Canadian citizans cf Japanese enigin.
Soe Hon. SENATORS: Hear, bear.
Hon. Mr. CRERAR: That, I tbink, is an
net of justice that bas bean too long dalayed.
AIl discrimination against Canadians
of
Asiatic enigin bas been removed. Net only
the Japanase, but the Chinesa and tbe East
Indians wbo ara Canadian citizees by adoption or birtb ara te ha treated as Canadian
citizens of full stature, so far as the francbise
is concernied.
Hon. Mr. EULER: But only se far as the
franchise is concarned. For instance, a Jap anase Canadian, tboughbarnm in British Columbia, still cannot go back te that province.

SENATE

Hon. Mr. HOWARD: That has nothing to
do with the franchise.
Hon. Mr. EULER: No, but it is discrimination.
Hon. Mr. CRERAR: I would remind my
honourable friend from Waterloo (Hon. Mr.
Euler) that I am speaking of the franchise.
Hon. Mr. EULER: I agree with what you
said as to the franchise.
Hon. Mr. CRERAR: My honourable friend
has thrown me off the track temporarily.
Hon. Mr. EULER: I am sorry.
Hon. Mr. CRERAR: I was about to add
that the way in which our franchise law discriminated for a good many years against our
citizens of Asiatic origin undoubtedly had a
prejudicial effect on Canada's relations with
Asiatic countries, and therefore I am doubly
glad that the discrimination is removed.
Something was said by the leader of the
opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig) and the honourable gentleman from Cariboo (Hon. Mr.
Turgeon) about the importance of trying to
arouse an interest in public affairs among the
electorate and getting a laigtr vote on election
day. Personally, I think that is very important. Is lias always sccmed to me that the
righit to vote is one of the most precious
possessions of a citizen in a democratic
country, because it enables hims to have a say
in how lit lsallic governed. It is the righit
to elest bis repreentative-ot his delegate,
not somn ie to cariy out his instructions, for
that idea is a distortion of our wliole parliamentary principle. It is the right to elect a
person who slall sit in parliament or a legislature or a municipal council and be his representative when laws are being made, when
expenditures are being undertaken, when taxes
are being levied. A rtepresentative speaks for
the constituency that elected him. To my
knowledge nothing finer lias ever been said
about the relationship that should exist
between the elector and the representative lie
sends to parliament than was said in Burke's
speci te his Bristol constituents well over
one hundred years ago. That speech will
stand re-reading time and time again by
honourable menibers of this house.
It is a natter of regret that so large a
numiber of citizens take so little interest in
the businpss of government, in the making of
expenditures and the levying of taxes; that
they fail te disciarge the first duty of citizenship w-hen they have an opportunity to do so.
How that problem is to bc met I do not
know, but it brings me to a comment on one
nev subsection in this bill that I think may,

on reflection, be considered unwise. There is
an amendment to the effect that Indians who
served in the last war should be given the
right to vote, which was accorded Indian
veterans of the First World War; but the
new subsection goes farther and confers the
right upon the wives of those Indians. If we
look at it sensibly we must ask ourselves,
"What contribution can the average Indian's
wife make to a decision as to who should
represent a constituency in parliament?"
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: None.
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: May I interrupt the
honourable gentleman? On rcading the subsection I was not clear whether it applied to
a squaw.
Hon. Mr. CRERAR: If she is the wife of
an Indian who served in either World War I
or World War IL, she will be entitled to vote.
That was the statensent made by the honeurable gentlemain who explained the bill (Hon.
Mr. Turgeon).
Hon. Mr. TURGEON: That is correct.
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: Subsection (t) on
page 4 of the bill reads:
Notwithstanding anything in this Act, a
wocian who is tie wife of an Indian person, as
defined in paragraph (f) of subsection two of
this section, which Indian person has served je
the naval, military, or air forces of Canaia in
the war of 19,14-1918, or in the war that began
on the tenth day of Septeiber, nineteen hundred and tbirty-inse, is entitled to have her
Isamce included in the list of electors prepared
for the polling division in which she ordinarily
resides and is entitled to vote in such polling
divisions, if such woman is otherwise qualified
as an elertor.
Wihat is lie meaning of those lest words in
the subsection?
Hon. Mr. CRERAR: I do net quito understand what is muant by the phrase, "if such
woman is otserwise qualified as an electoir".
Hon. Mr. TURGEON: That means if she
is net. for instance, untder agc, or an inmsate
institution.
of a meni
Hon. Mr. CRERAR: I was about to make
that observation. A wife wio is a miner of
say seventeen or eighteen ycars of age could
net qualify as an elector; but assuming that
she is net so di-squalified, the fact that she is
the wife of an Indian who served in the armed
forces entitles her to vote under this section.
I have again lest the thread of my argument.
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: I apologize to my
friend.
Hon. Mr. CRERAR: Perhaps I am oldfashioned, but to my way of thinking it is

JUNE 22, 1948
ail-important to realize that the business of
voting is a serious responsibility. One of the
moat dangerous trends affecting our whole
democratic systemn is the lighthearted and even
ignorant fashion in which many people
approach that responsibility. 1 venture to say
that if on an election day in this city one
could cati ail the people passîng up and down
Sparks street into a room and ask them some
simple questions to test their knowledge as to
their qualifications to vote, one would find that
many of them really would not know what
they were doing. That situation is not the
fault of society, because the people have newspapers and every opportunity to informn themselves. But they fail to do so because of their
complete Iack of interest in public matters.
May I say that one does not find that lack
of mnterest on the part of the people in sucli
countries as Poland and Czechosiovakia. They
know what the right of the free ballot means.
I arn not raising this point to suggest any
debarring of voting, but I do think that the
exercise of the franchise is one of our most
important privileges. At the risk of criticism,
I make the further observation that we have
at times too lightly extended the franchise to
people not fully qualified to discharge the
duties of citizenship. I do flot know just how
it can be remedied.
1 amn opposed to proportional representation
because I do not think it would add to the
effectiveness of our electoral machinery. I
eonfess that there was a time in my salad-days
when I thought that proportional representation was a good thing. But that was a time
when my experience of life was not what it is
today, and wheil beautiful theories had a
firmer grip on my imagination than they have
at the moment. 1 have a good deal of sympathy for the young enthusiasts who would
reformi the world aIl at once. 1, too, once
entertained these notions. But if they are
honest intellectually and informn themselves
intelligently, 1 have no doubt that time will
modify their views.
On the question of the transferable vote, 1
think a solid argument can be made in favour
of it. My honourable friend fromn Cariboo
(Hon. Mr. Turgeon)ý shakes bis hcad. I amn
not thinking of it in a partisan way; the
question must be considered a littie above that
level. The single transferable vote when carried out fully and honestly, means that the
member elected for a constitueney is the final
choice of a majority of the voters.
This is the way it operates. For instance,
there may be three candidates, A, B and C.
On the first counit A gets a mai ority over B
and over C but does not get a mai ority of ai]
5853-411

625

the votes cast. C being the lowest of the
three, is eliminated. The second choices on
the ballots for C then become first choices for
A and for B. If B gets sufficiently more choices
than A to outdistance A in the total vote each
receives, hie then becomes the mai ority repre.
sentative of the people of the constituency.
Is there anything u.ndemocratic about that?
Is that not real'ly a true basis for expression in'
the choice of a representative? If we th.rôwý
aside party finagling in an attempt to score afew votes here and there, and, look at it on the
basis which I think it should be considered
upon, the argument is aIl in favour of the..
single transferable vote.
I apologize to honourable senators, for taking
up so much time of the bouse. When the*
dàbate opened this afternoon I had no initen-'
tion of speaking, but as it developed 1 feit, the»
urge to say something. If I have tired you 1:
apologize.
Hon, C. C. BALLANTYNE: Honourable,
senators, I will take but a few -minutes of the
time of this chamber.
A great deal has been said by the honourabie
senator for Cariboo (Hon. Mr..Turgeon) about
getting people out to vote, but I did not hear
him say anyïthing about regulations, that would
prevent people fromn voting. The constituency'
I represented in another place is famed for
impersonation or, as some caNl it, "'telegraphing?"
Hon. Mr. EJUGESSEN: It was famous.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: A candidate*
would neve.r get eiect-ed in that constituency
unlcss hie did what 1 and others were forced.
to do. I hâd, inspectors for each division',
eighty in -all, keep a card, index systemn of every
voter-that was before women votedý-contaning a description of eàch voter, the colour oe.
his hair and, his eyes, bis religion, bis telephone_
numýber and where hoe worked. When a man
came to the poIl and said hie was Mr. JoncÉs,
the scrutineers .would look at Mr. Jones' car&,"
and if the vote-r d-id, not fit the description hie
would have to be sworn.
Hon. M-r. LACASSEff: Or finger-printed.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: They were very
clever. Ma3lbe conditions are not so bad now
as they were thirty years ago.
Hon. Mr. H{OWARID: Oh, -no; we bave
împroved.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE. In those days a
man who intended to impersonate a blacksmithl
would be dressed as one; if hie ýwanted to pass,
as a lawyer for the purpose of "«teiegraphing"
bis vote, hie wouid present the distinguished
appearance of aill legai gentlemen.

SENATE

There is a serious difflcxultv whicb affects
elections in our lanýge cities. My old constituency was of a good type; part of it was very
fine indccd; sorne sections contained many
forcigners. But the numhers of men and women
who did nlot live in the division but whose
narnes appeared on the lists would astonisb
any honourable member. When women first
had the right to vote. there appeared on oua'
roll the naines of hund-reds wxho, as far as their
relation to my div ision was concerned, might
have been residenîs of China.
Hon. Mr. EULER: You would no)t bave

Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE:

Hlon. Mr. DAVIES: One reason thcy do not
vote is Iliat a good, many of thein are left off
the lists. At Kingston, on. the occasion of the
recent. provincial elections. the narnes of 1,500
cligible people were ornittcd. 1 do not know
who is te blame, altbougb blame is passed
around, first te Ibis one and thon 10 that one.
It is my opinion that in the final analysis the
responsibility sbould rest with the returning
officer. But in tbe Ontario act-if I may refer
te il there is ýnothing which places the duty
on t1e returning officer. To a large extent the
rniseliirf i.s caused by the' f:ïct that enumerators,
boîlu as regards Dominion and provincial electien,.. arcecngaged on the basis of se inuch
rnriev for so miauv nabnes, and, having gel

the numnber of narnes wbich enlitles tbem 10
their remuncration, they stop working. The
selection of dnumeralors for the Dominion
cîcclions is divided. I believe, bel.wecn tbe two
old parties; now. perbaps. the third party is
also included. In my opinion no one should
ho al)pointcd as, enumerator unlcss he is aI
least twentr-one years cf age and undcrstands
wbat he is rcquircd te do.
Again, ail voters are net senaters or members
of another place, nor aie Ihey as politicallymindcd as we aie. There are people wbo
suddcnly wvakc up on election day 10 discox or
that Iheir namces are net on the list, and lhey
are vci'y indignant about il, because lbey worc
on previously and canne I understand wby tbey
have been omittcd.
I dIo not know whclher many constituencies
arc like t1e ricting cf Kingston. It i.; very
confusing. For federal purposes, Howe Island
and Wolfe Is.land are in Frontenac. Amherst
Lland is in Prince Edwaid-Lennox. But for
provincial purposeý, Wolfe Island, Howe Island
and Amlier,.t Island are in tIce cit 'y of Kingst on.
If a mL n or wornan living in the urban part

I know that failure to vote rnay be penalized
by disfranchisement or otherwise. My preference is ta have everything done that is possible to get everyone on the list, and to try
ta encourage people ta exercise the franchise.

the real difficulty: tbat governinents electc'dý
under the present system do net faveur a

At
What is done by the political parties?
Kingston, whcre elections are run very efficicntly, every voter gets a post card from the
candidates of the old parties, and possibly
also from the C.C.F., telling hlm or ber where
ta vote on election day.
Why cannot some system be adopted
wbereby every person entitled ta vote shall
be enabled ta vote? I know tbat courts of
revision exist for tbis purpase, but oftcn
tbey are not properly advertised. If during
tbe recent provincial elections in Ontario you
had looked, as I did, through the newspapers.
you would have found that some returning
officers liad large advertisements with big
type drawing the attention of vaters ta th,
fact that they must get tbemaselves on the list,
or, if nlot already on it, tbat they should
attend the sittings of the revising officers and
see ta it that their namnes were included. But
other returning officers used the very minimum of space ta advisc voters when sittings
of the revising offierrs were ta take place, and
often the notices were overlo'oked.
These, it seems ta me that are some of the
reasons why many people are not voting.
and evcrything possible should be donc ta
correct the situation.

success by this jug-handled, unscientifie, undemocratic and mast uinfair method, they
hav-e sýuceessively hesitated te make a change
in the systcma that was se satisfactory ta
them.

Hon. ARTHUR W. ROEBUCK: Honourable senators, I too will take just a moment.
1 could not allow this occasion ta pasz witbout expressieg seine disappointment in this
bill, and joining witli thc leader of thc opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig) in the hope that a
furt.her review of the Act will take place at
the next session of parliament.
The bill is largcly a matter of detail, and
its more or lcss unimportant, routine amendments ta the variaus sections, whieh are aIl]
right in their own way, no doubt required a
good deal of time, effort and application. But
I should like to sec the committec reconstituted fairly carly next session, s0 tbat withaut
baving aIl these details in its bands it could
actually attack some of the vital prablems
in aur clectoral system.
I join with the honaurable scnatar from
Churchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar), as I ýsa frequent]y
do, in express:ng pîcasure at tbe wiping out
cf the discrimination against thc Japanese.
I aise want ta jain with the leader of the
apposition in what hoe has said about the
transferable vote. I think lis argument is
unassailable. but I feel that hie failed ta attack

Hon. Mr. HAIG: Hear, bear.

Hon. Mr. IROERIJCK:

Having achieveil

Hon. Mr. EULERI: Let well enough alone!

Hon.

Mr.

ROEBUCK:

My honaurable

f icend's party in its present position is enthusiaýEtic about reform in systems of voting;
but 1 arn fairly confident that were the
Conservatives to take office under the present
sy, cm. they would be just as reactionary and
reluctant ta change as the present governmcnt
or any previaus government bas been.
The oeily tbing upon which I can base a
hope that a gavernment in office-be it the
present anc or some successor-will really
as-ail this problem, is the weight of publie
* D):n'or aroused hy thc rea!ization lhat. should
this systern continue in this country, we
run the risk of having a minority gavernment.
Han. Mr. HAIG: Hear, bear.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: I arn a democrat and
a liberal. and I arn satisfied ta abide by any

govýernmcnt, even a Conservative government,
if it is c'ected by the majority of thc people.
I have enougb confidence in the electors of
iii Dominion ta feel sure that any majority
gernment would be a reasonably wise one.
W-hat I fear is that a minority gavernment,
elected by_ less than fifty per cent, possib
one-third. of our electors, would impose their
wvill upan the majority of Ganadians.

The only way I know af avaiding such a
disaster wdth aIl its possible implications is ta
refarm aur system of vating. We can do so,
not by the proportional représentation methad,

whicb is net a political, possibility at thé
moment, b.ut by assuring tbat every representative who rendhes parliament shahl have
a m-aiority vote bebind him. ThIe situatiaon as
respects minority elcetionâ is getting worse
with the growth and increasing powers of third
parties, and with the divergences of political
philosopîy that are accepted and worked on by
these parties.

As ta a cornpuleory systern, I do nlot believe
in forcing anyone ta vote. The anly persan I
waul disfranchise would be someone flot
interested in vating. I amn in favour of the
electors going ta the poils and casting their
ballots as a civic duty. Negleet of the people
ta .go ta the poils tbrows a tremendous burden

128

SENATE

on the politicai parties to drag them there.
.Wor'.e thanl that. it places an evil advantage in
the banda of the party that is well financed.
Elections; have been made so expensive in this
way that the independence of the party edected
is~ at stake. 1 think that the need for reforrr
at this time is so great that it couniterbalances
any hesitation we should have in applying
eompulsion, if necessary, to the individual
citizen. In my judgment it is in the interests
of our country ani of the electors them.seives,
.that the people be required to go to the polis.
Il' this were donc, our politicai system would
be grcatly improvcd.
There are a numnber of minor details in the
EIections Act which are flot touched by this
bill. For instance, there is considerabie doubt
*Jnthe mincis of many peopie as to the right of
a sorutineer to give information as to who has
voted. It lias been ru'led severai times that
isecrecy applies to bow people vote, and flot to
ýwho lias or bias flot voted. As the Act is
indefinite in this regard, it wouid be a great
boon to a large numýber of peopie if it were
iuade amply clear that a scru'tineer, or anyone
baving knowledge of what is taking place
inside a poil, is entitied to give information
as to who hias voted.
A provision in the prcsent Act makes it an
,Offence foi anlyone to vote who lias bcen paid
by any candidate or party for services in connection with an election. In the pist 1 was
able to get sufficient voiuntary scrutineers
,and poil captains; to work without charge. 1
do noV know that 1 could do it today, and I
am quite sure that nîost candidates cannot.
Ail parties now compensate the personsmostly young women, at least in the citieswho sit in the polis ail day and act as scrutineers. Lt is an offen-ce for these ladies to cast
their votes. That is ail wrong. There is no
more rea-son
for
disfranchising
a paid
scrutineer than for disfranchising the deputy
returning officer, who aiso lias to remain on
the job ail day, and who is paid.

I hope that this is flot the iast amendment
of the Elections Act to be dealt with during
the present parliament, but that next session
the whoie question wiil again be submittcd to
a committee of another place and that a bill
based on the committec's work wili reach the
Senate in time for us to deal with it in the
iight of our experiences. 0f course, 1 do noV
aîgree at ail with the view of the leader of
the opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig) that we have
not as much riglit to discuss an elertions bill
as hias any honourable member of another
place. We have not only the rigbt but the
obligation to discuss a measure of this kind.
In that respect there is no reai difference
between an elections bill and any other bill
affecting the welfare of Canada.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was

APPENDIX

Tuesday, 22nd June, 1948.
The Joint Committee of the Senate and the
House of Commons appointed to continue and
complete the examination of the Indian Act
(Chapter 98, R.S.C., 1927), and amendments
thereto, beg leave to make their fourth report,
as, follows:
Pursuant to a resolution of the Senate dated
l3th February, 1948, your committee continued
and completed "the examination and consideration of the said Indian Act begun by a joint
committee pursuant to a resolution of the
Senate -on 'May 16, 1946, and continued by a
similar joint committee. pursuant to a resolution of the Senate on February 13, 1947".
Since May 13, 1946, there have been 128
meetings and 122 witnesses have been heard.
In addition, 411 written briefs from Indian
bands and organizations and from other individuals and organizations interested in the
welfare of our Canadian Indians have been
printed in the Minutes of Evidence.
During the present -session your committee
diligently examined the Indian Act section by
section and has agreed to report as follows:
Indian Act
Many anachronisms, anomalies, contradictions and divergencies were found in the Act.
Your committee deems it advisable that,
with few exceptions, ail sections of the Act
be either repealed or amended. The law officers of the Crown would, of course, need to
make otiier necessary and consequential revisions and rearrangements of the. Act which,
when thus revised, should be presented to
parliament as soon as possible, but not later
than the next session.
Your committee recommends that immediately parliament next reassembles a special
joint committee be constituted with powers
similar to those granted your committee on
9th February last and that there be referred
to the said special committee the draft Bill
to revise the Indian Act presently before the
law officers of the Crown.
All proposed revisions are designed to make
possible the gradual transition of Indians from
wardship to citizenship and to help them to
advance* themselves.
In order to achieve these objectives, your
committee recommends, in addition to other
recommendations hereinafter set out,

(a) That the revised Act contain provisions
to protect from injustice and exploitation such
Indians as are not sufflciently advanced to
manage their own affairs:
(b) That Indian women of the full age of 21
years be granted the right to vote for the purpose of electing band councillors and at such
other times as the members of the band are
required to decide a matter by voting thereon;
(c) That greater responsibility and more
progressive measures of self government of
reserve and band affairs be granted to band
councils, to, assume and carry out such
responsibilities;
(d) That financial. assistance be granted to
band councils to enable them to undertake,
under proper supervision, projeets for the
physical and economie betterment of the band
members;
(e) That such reserves as become sufficiently
advanced be then recommended for incorporation within the ternis of the Municipal Acta
of the province in which they are situate;
(f) That the off ence and penalty sections of
the Indian Act be made equitable and brought
into conformity with similar sections in the
Criminal Code or other statutes;
(g) That the Indians be accorded the samne
rights and be hiable to the samne penalties as
others with regard to the consumption of
intoxicating beverages on licensed premises,
but there shail be no manufacture, sale or
consumption, in or on a reserve, of "intoxicants" within the meaning of the Indian Act;
(h) That it be the duty and responsibility of all officials dealing with Indians to
assist them to attain the full riglits and to
assume the responsibilities of Canadian citizenship.
Your committee was given "authority to,
investigate and report upon Indian administration in general" and, in particular, certain
other matters, viz:
1. Treaty Rights and Obligations.
Your committee recommends that a commission in the nature of a dlaims commission
be set up, with the least possible delay, to
inquire into the terras of all Indien treaties in
order to discover and determine, definitely
and finally, such rights and obligations as are
therein involved and, further, to assess and

SENATE

settie finally and in a just and equitable maniner ail dlaims or grievances which have arisen
thcreunder.
2. Band Membership.
To replace the definition of "Indian" which
has been statutory since 1876, there must be
a new definition more in accord with present
day conditions.
Parliament annually votes
moncys to promote the weliare of Indians.
This money should nlot be spent for the
benefit of persons who are flot legally members
of an Indian band.
Your committee believes that a new definitien of "Indian" and the amendment of those
sections of the Act which deal with band membership will obviate many problems.
Your committee recommends that, in the
meantime, the Indian Affairs Branch should
undertake the revision of existing band
membership lists.
3. Liability of Indians to Pay Taxes.
Your committee recommcnds the clarification of those sections of the Act which deal
with the exemption from taxation of an
Indian's real and personal property on a
reserve.
Your cemmittee, howevcr, is of opinion that
Indians should continue to pay taxes on any
income earned by therni off, i.e., away from
their reserve, even though they do reside on
or have an interest in a reserve.
4. Enfranchisement of Indians, both Voluntary and Involuntary.
The revised Indian Act should, in the
opinion of your committec, contain provisions
to clarifv the present mIles and regulations
regarding eniranchisement.
5. Eligibility of Indians to Vote at Dominion
Elections.
As part of the education and preparation of
the Indian to assume his place in the Canadian
body politic, your committee recommended,
on May 6 last, tuat "voting privileges for the
purpoeofn Dominion elections be granted to
Indians on the same status as electors in urban
centres". This is a matter which, in the opinion
oi your committee, should be reierred to a
special committee on the Dominion Elections
Act, with a view to early implementation of
the recommendation.
Lt is realized that many Indians are not
anxious to have or to use the franchise, under
the misapprehensien that, if they do exercise
it, they wvill lose wvhat they consider their rights.
and privileges.
Many Indians who do not have the right
to vote at Dominion elections do pay taxes on
inconiie earned away frirom the reserve, together

withi sales tax, gasoline tax, excise tax, et
cetera. This is taxation without representation.
It is the opinion ni your cnmmittee that it
would encourage Indians, particularly the
younger ones, to interest themselves in public
affairs, if they were given the privilege already
recommended. Your committee is further oi
opinion that the public generally would thus
be given a better appreciation oi Indian affairs.
6. Encroachment of White Persons on Indian
Reserves.
Your committee recommends that the
revised Act contain provisions to prevent persons other than Indians imom trespassing upon
or irequenting Indian reserves for improper
purposes.
7. The Operation of Indian Schools.
Your committee recommends the revision of
tliose sections ni the Act which pertain to
education, in order to prepare Indian children
to take their place as citizens.
Your cemmittee, therefore, recnmmends that
wli rever and whenever possible Indian children should be educated in association with
other children.
8. Social and Economie Status of Indians and
their Advancement.
Ynur committee recommends that the govcrnmcnt consider the advisability oi granting
a pension to aged, blind or infirm Indians.
Thiis is in addition to iecommîiendations pieviously made with regard to the social and
economie advancement of Indians.
9. Indian Administration in General.
In 1946 and again in 1947 the Joint Committee on the Indian Act made recommendatiens with regard te
"1administrative improvements w hich could
bcecffected without the revisien ni existing
legislation and whicli, whien put inte effeet,
would remeve some ni the causes out ni which
arise grievances and complaints ni many
Indians".
There are still some "administrative imprevements" wliich yeur cemmittee dcems advisahle.
Yeur committee, therefere, again rcemmends that the administration ni ail aspects
ni Indian affajîs be placed under one ministerial hcad.
Your cemmittee reiterates the recommendation made by the 1947 Joint Committee ni the
Indian Act, viz:
"10. The Director ni the Indian Affairs
Branch . ..
should be named a commissiener who shahl have the rank, ni a deputy
minister and shahl have at least two assistant
commissioners ni whom one should be a
Canadian ni Indian descent".

JUNE 22, 1948
10. Parliamentary Inquiries.
Smnce 1867 there have been only two parliamentary inquiries into Indian affairs, each of
which was very narrow in scope. One, in
1920, dealt with Bill No. 14, which contained
amendments wîth regard ta the adoption of
the elective system of chiefs and councillors;
the other, in 1926, was a j oint committee which
inquired into the dlaims of the allied Indian
tribes of British Columbia.
Your committee recommends that the rules
of the House of Commons be amended ta
provide for the appointment of a Select
Standing Committee on Indian Affairs.
In the opinion of your committee such a
committee will be necessary for a few sessions
at, least -ta consider and report upon the working out of any Indian Act and regulations
framed thereunder.
Your committee considers a lapse of more
than 20 years without parliamentary investigation too long to permit of that good
administration of a branch or departmnent of
government which deals with such human
problems as Indian Affairs.
11. Advisory Boards.
Your committee recommends that the government consider the advisabîhîty of appointing such advisory boards or committees as,
from time ta time, are deemed necessary for
the carrying out of the provisions of the
Indian Act.
12. Other Cognate Matters.
There are certain aspects of Indian affairs
administration which, perforce, require co-operation between, the dominion and provincial
officiais, ta bring about the future economie
assimilation of Indians into the body politie
of Canada.
Your committee, therefore, recommends that
the government consider the desirability of
placing on the agenda of the next Dominion-

5853-42

631

Provincial Conference, for consideration by
the provinces, the following matters:
(a) Education,
(b) Health and social services;
(c) Fur conservation and development and
Indian traplines;
(d) Provincial fish and game laws;
(e) Provincial liquor legislation;
(f) Validity of marriage solemnized by
Indians, on Indian reserves, according to
tribal custom and ritual.
Your committee realizes that the matters
above enumerated are matters which, normally, are dealt with under provincial. legisiative powers. However, it should be possible
ta arrive at such financial arrangements
between the Dominion and provincial gaveraments as might bring Indians within the scope
of such provincial legislation, in order that
there be mutual and co-ordinated assistance
ta facilitate the Indians ta become, in every
respect, citizens proud of Canada and of the
province in which they reside.
13. Appendix.
The Minutes of Proceedings and Evidence
taken before your committee are tabled herewith.
14. Conclusion.
As this is the final report of your committee,
it is now considered fitting and timely ta
express due appreciation ta aIl those individuals and organizations which, by their
appearance before your committee, or by carefully prepared written briefs, rendered valuable help ta the dehiberations of your coinmittee.
Officials from several departmnents of government rendered particularly valuable service, as did Mr. Norman E. Liekers, Barrister,
who acted as counsel for the committee and
as liaison officer for the Indians of Canada.
All whîch is respectfully submitted.

JUNE 23, 1948
He said: Honourabie senators, this resolution cails upon the Senate to approve
Canada's participation in the International
Wheat Agreement opened for signature at
Washington on March 6, 1948 and signed by
thirty-six countries, inciuding Canada. No
additioniai legislation is required to implement
the agreement beyond that contained in the
Canadian Wheat Board Act and the Export
and Import Permits Act.
Formai acceptance of the agreement. is
requircd by July 1 by ail countries whose
legisiatures have becn in session since the
agreement was signed. Australia and severai
importing counitries on the Europ,-an continent have already accaptad. Th~e United
States bas flot yet done so, but there is a
fair possibility that it wiii accept later this
year; and the United Kingdoma is e xpectad to
do so shortiy. Approvai by Canada of the
agreement wiii therafore discharge our rasponsibulity for making it operative during the
coming crop year.
Honourahle senators are no doubt familiar
with the varjous proposais that have been
made from time to time for many years in
order to get soma stahulity into the world
wheat trade. I thînk it is sufficient to point
out that the method invoived in this agreement differs from the oid approach, in that
it guarantees tha movement of certain quantifies of wlieat wifhin an agraed price range,
lcaving trada beyond these specified quantities
to be governed by normai market forces. On
the ot'ner hand, the old proposais were in the
main attempts to, influence the price of wheat
by restrîcting world supplies.
The agreement nrow before us emerged from
conférences held betwecn suppiying and importing couintries in 1947 and 1948. It invoives
the annual sale of 500 million busheis of wheat
ever the next five crop years. 0f this quantity
Canada's share is 230 million bushals, our
normal axport surplus. The price range, hased
on No. 1 Northern in store Fort WilliamPort Arthur, provides for a ceiling price of $2
pc-rbushel e-ver the whole five-year period,1 and
a floor price beginning at $1.50 and declining
by tan cents each year tihereafter until a
figure of $1.10 is reached in the final crop
year. Fach importing country is assigned a
share of the 500 million bushals. It bas the
right to buy its quota at the ceiling price, and
assumes an obligation to buy it at the floor
price. The exporting countries, conversely,
must supply the contractual quantities at the
ceiling price in raturn for the right to sedi
such quantifies at the floor price. In other
words, the importing countries are assured of
supplies- at flot more than the ceiling price,
and the exporting countries have an assured

market for the amounts of -wheat 'specifiad in
the agreement at nut lass f han the floor prie.
The totda amounit of whcat-in world trade
at the présent time is about 850 million
bushels a year. It is cicar, therefore. that *à
substantial quantity over and *ahove the 500
million bushels specified in the agreement wili
flot lie subjeet to thesa guarantced pricas.
I may add that Russia and'Àrgentina, botb
large wheat-producing countries, declined the
invitation f0 participate in this agreement.
Their absence, however, wiil not affect the successfui working of the agreement, as the contractual quantities and, the agreed price remai 'n
in effect in spite of competition from wheat
outside the agreed quantities. The 500 million
hushels w .ili be traded within the guaranteed
price range, whef ler or flot other whaat is being
traded at prices higliar or .iowker than the
specified, cailing and floor prices.
It is important to note that the.terms of this
agreement in no way limit, our rights under
the Canada-United Kingdom Wheat Agreement. The $2 price for the 1948-49 crop year
undar the British contract remains in force,
and the price for the fourth year is to be
negotiated hefore the end of this year. The
agreement is non-committal about statas trading in wheat; the United States ýwill fulfil il,%
obligations without interfering with the privatý
sale of wheat, while Canada and Australia
wili continue for. the time heinag to sali through
their respective wheat boards.
Aithough the résolution expresing approval
of the agreement was passed in the other place
ivithout any matarial opposition, I think we
ail realiza that thora is considerable difference
of opinion with respect to it. I received froxin
a leading citizen of Winnipeg a carefully
reasonad argument against the general proposaI. I arn not, in a position to discuss it at
iength, but a perusai of it ieft me with the
query-and thera may bie something to it-whnt then? Without haing particularly wel

Probably this course, although it may not be

an important part in the ultimate settloment

It is my conviction that Canadian agriculture deserves well of the Canadian people. 1

As an instance, ]et me remind
present.
honourable senators that at the moment inany
types of secondary produets manufactured in
this country are heing sold to consumera at
prices woll albove tiiose prevailing in the
United States, the oconomy of which is most
comtparable to our own; yet our people do
not seem greatly disturbed. On the other
hand, meat, wheat, butter, milk and most
other basic agrieîîltîiral prodticts are bcing
sold at prices matcrially lower than those
ruling in the United States; yet, if for one
cause or another our prices rîse-not above
the Unit.ed States level, but to any point
approaching it-one hiears a tremendous outcîry. In my opinion the attitude of our
primary producers. in its calmness. its coolnýss, and its conservative approach to the.
problcms of the future, is an example to all.
Lt may be that, their good common sense lias
told them that they will suifer if prices
become unduly inflated. It must be rememhered howev'er that, in common with other
citizens, our agricultural 'producers are faced
with increasing costs for everything they buy,
s0 far as 1 know. except agricultural implemonts, which, after successive reductions of
duty, are now on the froe list. In passing it
niay ho remarked that while American implemonts are imported to Canada there is also a
flow of Canadian-produced implements in the
opposite direction.
It romains to be seen whether the proposais
emhodied in the prescrnt agreement will have
the highly desirable result of opening the
markets of the worid to the froc flow of goods.
But it, must ho said that any moasure which
promises a degree of serturity to the agriculturiýts of this country deserves most serious

consideration of members of this house and
of the country as a whole. Security for the
future is an objective which occupies the
minds of many people today, and it's expression takes many tangible forms. While the
present agreement may flot achieve ail the
success which some desire for it, I believo it
is incumbent on those who are critical of it
to offer some solution other than one which
in the past has had dire consequences for
agriculture as a whole.
Hon. JOHN T. HAIG: Honourable mcmbers, I do flot intend to indulgo this afternoon
in a general speech on the subject of the
marketing of farmn produots. But at no time
since the content of wheat agreements has beon
under discussion have I believed that such
agreements were practicable. I hope I have
been wrong.
As for this agreement, thirty-five of -the
thirty-six nations making it have signed; but
I undenstand that to date only one of the

cxporting nations has approved it.
agreement is bctween three selling nations
and thirty-three buying nations. Australia,
Canada and the United States are the three
selling nations, and their total export allotment is 500 million bushels of wheat per
year. 0f this Canada is te, furniali 230 million
bushels; I cannot s-ay what quantities Aus-tralia and the United States are to supply.
The other two great wheat-Iproducinýg nations
of the world, Russia and the Argentine, are
not parties to the agreement. Wheat is produced almogt everywhere, and I tiîink the
annual world production is approximately
500,000 million bushels.
Hon. M.r. CRERAR.: Five thousand million.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Yes, 5,000 million bushels,
of whieh, depending on changing conditions,
from 800 million to 1,000 million bushols are
traded in a year. This international wheat
agreement deals with 500 million bushols.
Wîthout considering the question of handling
'the grain, let, us examine the situation. Let
us suppose that Canada is to export 230 million
bushels of wheat: if the Canadian West
suifers a crop failure, with the result that
this country cannot supply its quota, what

happen? Nothing-I You cannot compel other
nations -to make up that shortage. That is
the situation with respect to the exporting
nations.

JUNE 23, 1948
Turning to the irnporting nations, ]et us
suppose that seime nations have agreed to take
a certain àmount of wheat, but later discover
that tbey do flot need it, or have flot the
necessary American dollars to buy it. What
wilI happen in that case? Can we make
them take it? How can we? The onîy way
would be to go to war. Under this agreement
the importing countries cannot be forced. to
accept the grain, so of what use is it?
The respective parliaments of the countries
who signed this agreement must approve it by
July 1, 1948. But here a new difficulty arisesthe United States Congress bas adjourned
until December. I admit that Ïts members
could be called back by the president; but
do you suppose that, in the light of the
political turmoil which will prevail in Philadeiphia for the next couple of weeks, they
would return -to Washington to discuss this
wheat agreement?
Further, do you think the American farmers
will submi.t to an upset price of $2 per
bushel and to a minimum price of $1.10?
They will not. The United States government,
flot the farmers, will bear the loss. Our
goverfiment has imposed a cont-rol; it d*oes not
proposze to do that. In -the last threc years
the Canadian government bas taken flot less
than $300 million from its farmers.
Hon. Mr. HORNER: More than that.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Yes, but to be on the
safe side I say not less than $300 million.
This money bas been given to the people of
Canada. The farmers are now giving us our
bread flour at $1.55 a bushel; but for many
years after controls wero established the
farmers supplied it at 771 cents.
As 1 see 't, honourable senators, the onily
good thing abýout this agreement is that it will
neyer bcecarried out. I cannot sec why a
country which has to import wheat should be
compelled to purchase that at $2 a bushel or
at $1.50. How are these prices established?
Wýhy should the price be $2 or S1.10? I
should like to ask the honourable senator
from Thunder Bay (Hon. Mr. Paterson) how
those figures were arrived at. They were
reached by taking the price on the competitive wor]d markets: on the Winnipeg, Chicago,
Kansas and other grain exehanges. This is
the vcry thing to wbich the men who drafted
this agreement were opposed.
I am flot blaming the government for this
agreement. The hcads of the wheat pools in
Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta werc
responsible for it. They forced it through.
and we are absolutely playing into their
hands. It is a mistake to think that nations
will sell their wheat below its value, or that

635

other nations will huy it above its value when
they can get cheaper wheat elswhere. Take
any of the thirty-three countries named on
the list. If Afghanistan, for instance, could
buy wheat under this, agreement for $1.50 a
bushel, but Russia offered to furnieli it at $1
a bushel, Afghanistan might possibly be so
concerned about the covenant it had made
that it would pay the S1.50. But is that
likely when the wheat could be purchased
from. Russia at $1 a bushel? I can think of.
many countries which would buy it at $1 a
bushel. What would Austria do, with the
armies of Russia at ber back door? She might'
say. "We can buy wheat from Russia for $1
a bushel. but ive bave to pay $1.40 to Canada
or the United States". Then Russia could
say: 'Why buy wheat at $1.40 a bushel from
that great octopus, the United States, when
we can selI you wheat rigbt at your own back'
door for $1 a bushel?"
It is beyond my
comprehiension how we, as sensible men and
women. can expect people to carry out sucli
an agreement.
My honourable friand opposite, in tbe course
of bis remarks, referred to a certain wcllknown economist. The gentleman referrcd to
is W. Sandford Evans of Winnipeg, one of thei
înost competent grain authorities ini tbe world
today. He pointed out that if a country
refused to import or export as it bad agreed
to do, it would take fifty-four days to get
the machinery in motion to try to compel it
to do so. What would happen in the meantime? Right now we are having trouble over
our wheat contract with Great Britain.
There is great agitation over this whear
business. 1 have figures which show that up'
to the l6tb of June this year our shipments
of wheat are about &3 million bushels below
what they were at tbis time a year ago. Anhonourable senator whom I wîll flot identify,.
but wbo sits not far from me, bas a large
quantity of grain in a granary. So bave many
other farmers ail over the West. Why do
they flot send it forward? 1 do not know,
altbough I bave an idea. The bonourablosenator from Lunenburg (Hon'. Mr. Duif) is
an expert on fisb, but I am sure that if liewere in the markct for grain and bad an offer
from the Argentine at $1 a bushel, be would
nlot buy from the United States at 81.40.
Hon. Mr. DUFF: You are rigbt.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: That is only human
nature. If a certain article were for sale oz
Sparks street at $1, I would not go somewher&
else and pay $1.40.
In the International Wheat Council thé;

speech made last niglît b' foi-mer President
Hoov'er before the Republican convention at

1 disagree with hirn. When we cerne te

ttWr cannot pay yen $2 a bushel, because in
the international wheat agreernent yen fixed
for tic year 1948-49 a maximum of $2 and a

I have ne doubt that at the first opportunity

a policy.
This wheat agreement is the werst piece
of child's play imaginable. 1 arn surprised

di-cte.dicn. ,hoiiltd <lnaw up a centraet that

J UNE 23, 1948
30,000 metric tons of wheat a year. Do
honourable senators believe that if Russia
has wheat to seil she will allow Czechoslovakia
to buy from us?
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: Is that flot in the
nature of an allocation?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: That is how the 500
million bushels is made up.
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: But these countries
do not have to take a specified quantity?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Oh, yes, they do; they
have to take 500 million bushels.
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: But the quantities
specified for the various countries are allocations.
Hon. Mr. HAIG:- They agree to take the
quantities specified.
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: Is the agreement not
an attempt to allocate to the various countries
the world supply of wheat?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: No. It covers only 500
million bushels.
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: To that extent it is
an -attemçst to allocate the supply.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Yes.
The price of wheat on the world market was
at one tirne $1 a bushel. I well remember the
time, and so does the honourable senator for
Churchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar>, when we thought
$1 was a good price. I have seen my father
seli wheait at 50 cents a bushel. I recaîl an
occasion in this bouse wben we argued a long
time to get the goverrument to guarantee 80
cents a bushel.
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: But my thought is
that if we agree on an allocation of the over-alI
supply of wheat to the various countries, àl is
a maitter of common sense that they *will
accept it only as long as it is profitable for
tbemn to do so.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: That is exaotly what I arn
saying. The agreemnent is absolutely unworkable. I contend that these countries w-ill take
their allotments only as long as it is in their
interest to do so, and when it is to their
disadvantage they will refuse them. The same
attitude will apply t.o the seller. If we can
selI our wheat for $3 a bushel we may carry
out the agreemerot and give 250 million bushels
to the pool at $2, but we certainly w-ill not like
doing it.
Hon. Mr. HOWDEN: May I ask the honourable senator whether, if this agreement is
workable, it wrill put us in any worse position
than we are in now?

637

Hon. Mr. HAIG: I answered that question
a while ago. The only good thing I can say
about the agreement is that I do not think its
terms will be carried out. That appears to me
to be the best part of it. 1 arn positive that
the United States.--whicb is allotted about 180
million bushels-will ratify the agreement only
as an atternpt to bring about world peace and
stability. That country will neyer approve of
it as a business proposition. I believe that
public men who, like Senator Vandenberg, are
irn favour of the United Staites doiag something
towards international peace, may be able to
convince Congress that the agreement should
be ratified on that ground.
Hon. Mr. HORNER: But that country will
subsidize its farmers.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: They will be subsidized to
the extent of about $1.50 per bushel.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: What happened to
the London agreements in the thirties?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: They were neyer carried
out.
Wc have now got as far as the signing of a
preliminary agreement. Australia bas agreed to
it on the condition that the United States
participate in it.
I pointed out wbat imiight bappen with
respect to Czecbostovakia buying wheat from
us, and I cari give instances of other countries
in somiewhat 'the saine position. For instance,
Norway would like 'to deal with us, but Russia
may have somnething to say about that. So far
as Egypt and Greece are concerned, they will
buy whcat as long as we give themn the money
to pay for it.
I arn absolutely opposed to this wheat agreement. I -tbink we are just going th.rough a
formality that means nothing. We are not
even fooling ourselves. I do not think any
honourable member of this house expeets that
the agreement, if ratifled, will be carried out.
Even if it started to operate, it would last only
as long es the participating counitries felt that
they .were operating on an even keel. The
minute the price on the open market goes
down, the buying counltries will cease to buy;
and if the price goes up, -the selling cousitries
will complain and demand conditions that will
make it impossible to, carry out the agreement.
Finally, where are tbe buying countries
going to get the money to pay for wheat,
unless the United States allows foreign goods
into tbat country? That proposition does not
look ve.ry promising for the next two years.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Howden the debate
was adjourned.

DOMINION

ELE'CTIONS BILL

THIIRD READING

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON moved the third
reading- of Bill 19S, an Act to amenci the
Dominion Elections Act, 1938.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the third time, and passed.

H{e said: The purpose of this bill is to
increase the salary of the Lieutenant-Governor
ef Prince Edward Island fromn $7,000 te $8,000
a year. As honeurable senators are aware,
parliament fixes the salaries of lieutenantgoveruors. These salaries vary froin province
te province. In Ontario and Quebec they are
$10,000, in six other provinces 39,000, and in
Prince Edward Island $7,000. Incorne tax, of
course, is paid on these salaries. In some
provinces goverument bouses are provided.
Such is the case in Prince Edward Island, but
the lieutonant-governor of that province personally bas had te meet practically ahl the
costs of upkeep and the secretarial expensos.
Perbaps the duties of the Lieu tenant-Govern or
cf the Island are net quite as heavy as those
of bis colleagues in some other provinces, but
the goverement felt tbat parliament should be
asked te grant this $1,000 increase in salary
because cf the rising financial obligations connected with the position. There bias been ne
adjustment. of lieu tenant-go vorn ors' salaries
in forty years.
I do net believe that the government can be
accused cf extravagance in the measure now
being presented for consideration. The position in question is an honourableoe, and as
the stipend bas remiaiued se long unchanged,
and iicome ta-< and other exponditures have
increased, il could wvell ho arguod that if the
institution is te continue and te ho within the
reach of tho-ýe in moderato circumstances, the
w'hole salary structure peî taining te these
al)pointlnents should ho reconsidered upon
seme appropriate occasion.
Reflecting on the general subject, another
con-sideration bias occurrcd te me whichi I
should like te briefly brin g te your attention.
Tbis bill seeks te amend the Salaries Act,
which is the statute under which the salaries of
cabinet ministers are paid. What I arn about
te say will ho said on my own responsibility,
without plier consultation of any kind with any
of my colleagues. I feel ne personal embarrassment in raising the matter, because by ne
stretch of the imagination could tbe benefits
of the proposai apply te me personally.
0f recent years I bave been impressed with
the large amouint cf discussion and legisîntion
in relation te retirement pensions. They have
hecome part and parcel cf our systemn cf
federal goverement, and, indeed, moat cf our
other goveruimental systems.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Ahl.

SALARIES
SECOND

BILL

READING

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON meved the second
reading of Bill 365, an Act te amond the
Salaries Act.

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: The incidence cf
higli incom-fe tax, and low interesi rates have
tended te shift attention from salary levels to
adequato retirement allowances. The pension
systeri bias been adepted by almost ail the

JUNE 23, 1948
great financial organizations and rnost of the
business institutions of this country, althougb
this development has attracted less, publicity
than a similar type of provision for the civil
service. 1 arn convinced that in the not far
distant future the question of some form of
contributory pension for everyone will become
vitally important, because there is ne one but
will find, if and when lie reaches old age, that
his earnings have materially diminished.
Thinking on the matter, it occurred to me
that I should take this opportunity to refer
to a proposai whicli is not without precedent
in the parliamentary practice of other countries, and wvhicli. wvhen the proper tirne cornes,
we should weigh with great care. I refer to
the question of whether, and under what
c]rcumistances and conditions, men who have
served the state long and fait'hfully should
not be eligible for some provision for their
declining years.
As I have said, the idea is not a new one.
It originated. 1 presume, for the reason that
by custom and tradition, an indiviciual wlio
becomes a member of the government must
dis9sociate himiself from ail business activities,
particularly those which are directly or
indirectly related to governmcnt administration. Trhe wliole social structure lias clianged
sO materially, and governrnent affects so many
businesses, that the requirement arnounts to
a prohibition of any ministerial association
with private business. The high standard of
rectitude and intcgrity which characterizes
our public men, wliether in the federal or the
provincial field, reflects great credit upon
thernselves and the country. U'nder the law
of Great Britain there is provision for pensions for ministers who have served a certain
period of time.
Hon. Mr. EULER: At one time we had a
similar provision.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSýON: As my honourable friend reminds me, at one tirne there
'vas a similar law on our statute books. 1
looked up the act and read it, and the discussion in connection with it, and with the
permission of honourable senators I shall
make a few brief references to the debates.
On July 17, 1905. parliament passed a bill
entitled "An Act respecting annuities for certain Privv Councillors." The bill provided
that every cabinet minister or prime minister
wlio retîred at the end of at least five years
of consecutive service sliould upon retirement
be paid a life annuity of one-hlf bis salary,
less any other salary or pension lie might
receive frorn the Crown after his retirernent.
The measure was introduced rather late in
the session, and 1 gather from reading the

reports that there was no extended discussion
of it. Honourable Mr. Fielding, Minister of
Finance, introduced the measure, and Sir
Robert Borden, then Mr. R. L. Borden, leader
of the opposition, also supported it in principle.
Apparently between the date of introduction
and the following session there was considerable critîcîsm of this measure througliout the
country, s0 much se that when parliarnent
met in the following year Mr. Fielding proposed that the legisîntion be repealed. This
was accordingly donc.
During the debate on the motion to repeal
the legislation many different views were
expressed, but rny impression frorn a careful
reading of the report is that, except for one
or two members Nvho were opposed to pensions of ail kinds and maintained that the,'
riglit course was to pay higher salaries and Jet
ministers look after tliselves, the principle
of the measure received unanimeus support.
Both mn and out of parliament there were
rnany suggestions that the legislation liad not
been carefully considered. There was a proposaI thnt the Britishi practice be followed,
but this was bruslied aside as being unsatisfactory. Finally, in the session of 1906, the
government decided to repeal the bill. Sir
Wilfrid Laurier spoke at great length. He
took the position that in principle the pension
scheme was right, but agreed that the difficulties should lie given furtiher study. In concluding the debate Mr. Fielding su id.
The ground on which. 1 faveur the repeal of
this Act is that it is evidently in advance of
the public opinion of the country, and to that
public opinion we are all obliged to Iow...
This matter will corne up again wlien sorne of us
are no longer here, and I want te say that this
Act will net be repealed witli ry consent on
the principle that pensions are wrong, but
simply hecause it is in advance of the publie
opinion of the day, and I think we sliould bew

te tiat public opinion until, by tIe process of
education, the country is prepared te do that
which in principle I believe it would be rigît
te do.

Honourable senat ors, I have only .mentioned
this hecause, ne matter how desîrable it may
le, this subjeet is always a dîfficul't one te put
forward for consideration. Honourable senators know that legislation affecting revenues
is preceded by resolution ernanating frorn
tliose who would be direcîtiy interested. Even
thougli tliey saw fit, members of the House
of Cemmons would net be in a position te
advance sucli a scheme, becaiuee they miglit le
open te a charge that they were ambitious te
benefit frorn it.
Bearing- in .mind the econorny of the country and -the trend 'loth in and out of the
government service, it seems te me that some

group or body could render a useful public

SENATE

service by inquiring into this matter and, after
giving the public an opportunity to express its
opinion, making a report. In fact, I would
suggest that orme time in the future the
Senate itself could make such an inquiry.. This
scheme would not apply to everyone, but I
have in mind two or three men who hold positions of great responsibility that it would
affect. This is not a political matter, but one
involving a principle. I think consideration
slould be shown to the future of those people
who have served their coun-try faithfully and
well, and who have reached a time when they
can no longer carry on their duties. As I have
said, I feel no personal embarrassment because,
by no stret,ch of the imagination could the
proposal apply to me.
Honourable senators, for the reasons I have
outlined I would ask you to consider, between
now and the next session, whether or not it
would be worth while to seek public opinion
on this matter.
Hon. W. RUPERT DAVIES: Honourable
senators, I should like to say a few iwords about
this bill. I did not know that the leader of
the government was going to touch on the
malter of pensions for cabinet ministers.
I think the ,alaries of the lieutenantgovcrnors of the provices of Canada are
altogether too small. I was surprised to learn
how small thev are, and that they have not
been changed in forty years. I do not think any
of us would care to be earning today the same
wages we earned forty years ago. We have
raised the salaries of judges and others.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: And our own.
Hon. Mr. DAVIES: Yes, but we do not
seem to have donc anything about lieutenantgovernors. I wvas further surprised to hear
that theie
utenant-Governor of Prince
Edward Island, who is to get the magnificent
mocrease of 81,000 per year, lias to pay his own
expenses.
I notice that the Lieutenant-Governor of
Ontario receives a salary of $10,000. I do not
know whether out of that he bas to pay his
expenses or not. I understand that he gets a
small allowance. However, in a big province
like Ontario, only a rich man can afford to be
a lieutenant-governor these days. This province has been fortunate in having as lieutenant-governors, wealthy men who have done
magnificant jobs. I particularly call to mind
Lt.-Col Harry Cockshutt, who was Lieutenant-Governor many years ago. He travelled all over the province, viiting civic officials
and prominent people in the cities, towns, and
villages. Also, at his own expense, he entertained count'y councillors and others from all

parts of tic p.rovince at a ;eries of luincheons
held in Government House in Toronto.
Ve are fortunate today in having a wealthy
man as our Lieutenant-Governor. I understand that he ton is doing a splendid job.
Nearly every day I read in the newspaper that
he and his wife are either entertaining or
attending some kind of function. They are
both busy people. I am a Liberal, but I do not
always agree witli som1e things that Liberal
governments do. I strongly disapproved of
the action of the Liberal government which
came into power in Ontario in 1934, in
abandoning Government House in Toronto
and closing Ontario House in London,
England. I had hoped that wben the Conservative party came back into power it would
re-open Governiment House.
I had heard
from a reliable source that this would happen,
but as yet it bas not occurred. I hope this
matter will be reconsidered and that something will b( done about it in the future.
I do not sec any reason why any lieutenantgovernor should have to purchase a big home
-as
the present Lieutenant-Governor of
Ontario has had to do-in order to entertain
the people of his province. I know there was
a feeling that Government House in Toronto
was just a gathering place for the society
people of that city. It was nothing of the
kind. But even if it was, what of it? I sec
nothing wrong withlhaving sucli social gatherings in our capital cities. We have thenm here
at Ottawa. Every one of us has bcen invited
to a grand affair at Rideau Hall on the first
of July next, and I an sure that it will be
a very fine occasion. Such events are good
for the social life of our country.
I come back to the question of lieutenantgovernors' salaries. I know that when dealing with a bill it is not within our power to
make an amendment that would cause an
increase in expenditure, so I shall merely
express my idea in the form of a suggestion.
It is that next session the leader of the goverament try to have another amendment to the
Salaries Act brought in, to raise the salaries
of the lieutenant-governors of Ontario and
Quebec to $15,000 each, and of the lieutenantgovernors of the other provinces to $12,000
each. That would increase the total expenditure on this account from $82,000 to $114,000,
whi-ch is not a large item. I doubt very much
that even those salaries would pay the incumbents' expenses. My old friend the late Tom
Miller, during the short time that lie was
spared to occupy the high position of Lieutenant-Governor of Saskatchewan, lived in a
hotel; I take it for granted that no Government House was provided for him. Quebec,
which is wiser in this matter than we are in

JUNE 23, 1948
Ontario, has, we ail knaw, a beautiful Government House, on the banks of tbe St. Lawrence.
I have attended a number of splendid funetions there. I amn a strong believer in the
maintenance of aur connection with the
Matheriand, and I think tbat His Majesty's
representatives at Ottawa and in the provincial
capitals sbould each be paid an adequate
saiary and furnished with an apprapriate residence wbere distinguished visitars can be
entertained.
I wisb ýta say a few words about pensions.
As tbe honourable leader of tbe gavernment
(Hon. Mr. Robertson) remarked, aur ideas
change. In 1905 I was ana of a group warking
hard in a printing office for low wages. We
tbougbt it was prudent ta save wbat littie
-ne couid as a protection against the inevitable day wban we couid na longer work, but
we neyer dreamed af pensians. In the meantime, and especially during the last ten years,
the public bave become pension cansciaus.
From mny connection witb a number of
arganizations I bave learned that people today
are in favour of pension plans, particuiarly
plans ta wbich tbey cani contribute.
As ta pensions for cabinet ministers, I arn
in favour of the genaral idea, tbougb I can see
a good many difficulties in the way. For
instance, a man can enter tbe cabinet an tbe
invitation of the Prime Minister ta become
ana of bis counciliors, and if it any time it is
feit that tbe services of tbat member ara no
langer desirabla bis resignation can be asked
for. It would seam ta me, therefore, that same
minimum term of service should be nacassary
befare ministers became eligibie for pensions. 1
do not know what termn migbt be suggastad.
Hon. Mr. QUINN: The Act of 1905 stipulatad five years.
Hon. Mr. DAVIES: Tbat daes nat saam ta
be long anough; perbaps tan years would ba
better, aithough of course some goverrnments
do nat Iast that lengtb of time.
Howevar, as I bave said, I amn in favour of
the general principie of pensions. Most of us
in this bouse bave livad long enaugh ta bave
faund that nothing is harder ta guass accurataly than the amount of a certain person's
wvealth. Taa often, I amn afraid, we have discavered tbat men who served the country
weli bave died much poorar than wa thought
tbay ware. I recall that many years ago, after
the daatb of a man who had long and ably
fillad a praminent office in the province of
Ontario, a subseription had ta ba taken up
for bis widow. Here is another instance. A
Dominion cabinet minister was ganerally supposad ta be wealthy; but when ha died a
settiement at s0 much on the dollar had ta

641

be arrangcd witb bis creditors. That was told
ta me in amazernent by a friend of mine, the
president of the trust company which handled
the estate. We have to, recognize that these
things happen. A man occupying bigh publie
office may have littie time ta look after his
personal interests, and at the end of ten or
flfteen years of service his estate may be smail.
I baliave the tima has came when avery man
and woman in this rich country shouid be able
to look forward ta an aid age free from financi worries. 1 do flot think aur aid age pension rates today are bigh enough. Of course,
any worth-wýhile increase in the rates wouid
raise the cost to the country by millions of
dollars, and we ail want lower taxes. Neyertheless, I feel that better provision sbouid ha
made for aur elderly people. We know that
many persons, nwing ta cireumnstanes beyand
tlieir control, have been able ta put aside but
little of this worid's goads for their aid age.
This is particulariy true of hard-workîng men
and women who have struggled ta give their
childran a good education, a better start in life
than they themselves had. Only last weak
my attention was drawn ta the case of a
man and bis wife wha had put four childran
througli university, and who 110w, when past
sixty. are wondering what is ta becorne of
tbamseives.
I -ball support any reasonable scheme of
pensions for cabinet ministers wba bave served
a cer-tain minimum lengtb af time. And I
hope that next session ail tbe lieutenantgovernors wiii be givan an increase in salary.
Hon. FELIX P. QUINN: Honourabla senators, I bad boped that wben suggesting
incraased salaries the leader of tbe government
(Hon. Mr. Robertson) and tbe bonourable
gentleman from Kingston (Hlon. Mr. Davies)
would bave mentianed one particular public
office wbich I arn sure we ahl agree is entitled
ta some consideratian in this report. I refer ta
tbe high and responsible position of Prime
Minister of Canada, for which the salary is
$15,000 a year. I daubt if any ather country
comparable ta Canada pays its laading statesman such a paltry sum. As honourable members of another place migbt feal some delicacy
in moving ta bave this matter considered, I
suggest it is nat anly aur rigbt, but aur duty,
ta initiate consideration of it in the Senate.
I therafora suggast that a bill ta increase the
Prime Minister's salary sbauld be introduced
here next session. The Prime Minister of
Canada should receive $50,000 a year. He
shouid get at least as much as the GovernorGeneral, whose stipand is fixed at £10,000.
I bring these matters ta tbe attention of
the bouse and ask the leader of the government ta consider them.

SENATE
Hon. J. A. LESAGE: Honourable senators,
I wish to express myseif as being in agreement
with the honourabie leader of the government
on this matter. I heartiiy concur in a plan
for tbe payment of pensions to those who have
spent their lives in the public service. Some
men wbo have been members of parliament
for twenty or twenty-five years, and may have
been ministers of the Crown for two or three
years, leave the public service much poorer
financially than when they entered it.
In considering pensions for public men wc
should flot overlook the need of providing for
their widows. A man wlio has been in the
public service for sav twenty-five years may
die leaving bis widow witbout adequatc mceans

of support. I suggest that provision should be
made for the widows of those who have spent
a large part of their ]ives in the publie .service.
Hon, W. J. HUSHION: ilonourabie senat.ors, the discussion this afrernoon recaîls to
my mind the Judges Bill passed in this bouse
in 1946, increasing the salaries of judges.
Following the passage of that bill aIl t.he
.iudgcs in Canada, except two in Montreai,
got the inci ease.
The senior of the ýtwo
gentlemen I refor to bias been on the bencb
twenty-one years, and the junior fourtee-n or
flfteen years. I hav e been unable Io get a
satisfacrory answer as to why these two men
did ntot receive the salary increase.
One
reason gîven isthat their courts bave been
cliang( d. But tbey are stili judges in the
employ cf the govcî'nment, and wiil likely
continue te lic foir some vears to corne. 1
spoke to tbe officiais in the Department of
Justice about this matter and I got only a
vague answer. I m'xy sny that if that is tbe
attitude the cicpartment chooses te tak-e it
will net hielp tbe ministers who are looking
for pensions for tbemoelves.
I have wondc-red wbether this body h.ad
any mettes iay which jr, could inquire into tbe
reason for denying the salary increase to thiese
two judg-es. It, would amont to only a few
thousand dollars, but 1 t.bink we should know
the reason.
On the question of pensions. bonoîtrable
senators know that there are tbousands cf
men and women working for the government
on a tcmporary basis wbo do net 'part.icipate
in the pension plan except for the small
deductions taken off their pay. They get -ne
benefits such as sick leave, and they are in
constant fear cf being let out. cf tbe service.
There are bundrcds cf sucb people in the
Pos.t Office Department and the Department
of Public ',Works. I would sooner give consideration te pensions for such temporary
employ ees than for lieu tenant-governors or

ministers. Surely civil servants bave as mucb
rigbt, to look te the government for pensions
as enaployees

in industry have 'te look to

tbeir employers for similar protection. 1 hope
that some censideration will bie given te this
question which 1 luise. I wouid do my share
in any way I couid te give the necessary help
in this respect.
Hon. J. E. SINCLAIR: Honourable senators, I wish te say a few words in support of
the bill, but

I support this measure te provide for an
încrease in the compensation of tbe Lieu-

tenant-Governor of Prince Edward Island. but
in doing se I wish te say tbat the increase

increases for the lieutenant-govern ors of the
other provinces. These gentlemen are work-

and those of aiiied counitries caîl at one cf

these capital cities the ship's personnel is
entertained by the lieuiteniant-gex ernor. He
is expected te give a bail in their bonour, and
in turn is entertained on board ship. Lieutenant-governors at iniand capitals de net
have te mcct expenses of tbis nature, but
tbere are other social amenities wvhicb must
be performed in a manner and style whichi is
in keeping with the dignity of the office of
lus Majesty's reprosentative in the provinces.
1 support the bill. but 1 do se believing that
the increcase i0 compensation is not large
enough.

lion. SA-LTER A. IIAYDEN: Honourabie
senaters, I ami heartiiy in faveur of the
measure now before us. 1 also support the
views expressed by the leader cf tbe goveranrieot andl seine othex' bonourabie senators who
have spoken.
It must be remiembered that the implications
which arise from considerations cf this nature
bave many angles. There are features cf the
mattex' which extend into the lives and homes
of ail the Canadian people. If we are te cen-

sider providing pensions for those wlio bave
served the country weii, we must at the saine
time consider the position cf the people whose
tax contributions wiil make possible the distribution of monies for that purpose. Their
relative position in the scheme of things bas

been recognized te some extent in our income
tax laws, by making some aiiowance for con-

JUNE 23, 1948
tributions towards pensions and old age benefits. But this affects only a portion of the
population. There remains the great body
of people who are taxpayers, ail of whom have
to face the possibility of growing old. So the
issue is much bigger than that of providing for
one, or two, or a number of persons. Its
scope is national, affecting ahl the people, and
it must be deait with on that basis.
In these days the question of securîty is
extremely important. People are subi ect to
high taxation affecting almost every article
they need in order to live and carry on their
affairs. So my suggestion would be that we
should not rush into a commitment with
respect to a particular classification or occupation, but should consider the whole sphere
of the lives of aIl the Canadian people, so that

any plan we may work out shall be comprehensive enough to assure a decent measure of
security for ail. It may follow the pattern of
our provision for individual cases, but let it
be broad and far-reaching; then. the quality
and intensity of our national thought, loyalty
and patriotism will be ail that we desire.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was

MANITOBA NATURAL RESOURCES BILL
REPORT 0F OOMMITTEE

Hon. T. A. CRERAR presented the Report
of the Standing Committea on Natural

Manitoba Natural Resources Act.

THIRD

READING

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON moved the third
reading of the bill.
Hon. JOHN T. HAIG: Honourable senators,
lst evening this bill was discussed in committee at ývery great length, and I want to
thank the chairman and the other members of
the committea for their very thorough consideration. It was in the best traditions of
this chamber. I wish also to thank the members who voted in favour of some of the ideas
I expressed. Naturally I arn intensely interested in thýis legishation, for it affects flot only
the province of Manitoba but-and, more intimately-my own city of Winnipeg. It also
affects two principles which govern our aotivities there: that of municipal or public ownership, and that of private ownership.
When the bill had been fully discussed in
committea, and a motion was made to adopt
it, I moved an arnendm'ent calling for further
consideration. 1 do not intend to re-introduce
the amendment now, because, as I have stated,
the merits and demerits of the bili1 have been
fulhy canvassed. I amn persuaded that every
man who voted for the amendment did so
because he believed that be was doing so in
the best interests of Manitoba, and in partîcular of public and private ownership in
Winnipeg. I arn equahly convinced that those
who voted against it were influienced by the
same high motive; and I have no complaint
to make about either the discussion or the
voting.
With the permission of the Senate I shahl
read the amendment to which I have referred.
I do so because a number of the members,
when it was pu-t to the vote, took the side of
the minority on the understanding that 'I
would state our position here. It was intended
tû insert, as subsection 2 of section 2 of -tbe
bill, the fohhowing:
Provided however that nothing contained ini
the said agreement shall ha construed as authorlzIng the province of Manitoba to take or
acquire any property fromn the owner thereof
cornpulsorily or by expropriation or by any
other mieans without pay ment of compensation
therefor:

SENATE

Provided further that the compensation to
be paid shall be an amount to be agreed upon
between the parties, or, in case of disagreement, shall be settled hy arbitration under ýthe
provisions of the Arbitration Act of Manitoba
or by a court of competent jurisdiction in that
province.

I think that amendment should have been
nmade to the bill: it wouid have heen in the
best interests of public ownership, private
ownership and invested capital in this country.
I realize that legal arguments can be made
on both sides. It may be said that Manitoba
sbouid have control over its natural resources
because-and there is no disputing it-the
provinces oi Quebec, Ontario, New Brunswick
and Nova Scotia have had absolute control
over their resources since Confederatiýon. But
there is a difference: if the nid province of
Quîebec had granted a power site to a certain
company, the Fathers of Confederation would
have protected the rights of the company
tînder the transfer. That is what I was seeking to accomplish by this ameadment.
However, aiter the very able cross-examination conducted in committee by a distinguished senator from Toronto, the Premier of
Manitoba should realize -that in a Senate committen one cannot get away with murder,
but has to 'watch his "P's" and "Q's"; 1 arn
persuaded that there will be no act of compulsion, and that the owners of these sites in
Manitoba will reccdvc fair compensation.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: Honourable
eenators, the question is on the third reading of
Bill K-il, an Act to amend the Manitoba
~Natural Resources Act. Is it your pleasure to
concur in the third reading ni this bull?

CUSTOMS

BILL

SECOND READING

Hon. WISHART
MeL.
ROBERTSON
moved the second reading of Bill 229, an Act
to amend the Customs Act.

He said: Honourable senators, the purpose
of this bill is to, make certain changes in the
wording of the Act to bring it into coniormity
with changing administrative practices. This
involves the repeal of certain obsolete sections
and the revisiun of others.
Most of the
changes are of a comparatively simple and
straightforward nature, such as the substitution ni "Tarifi Board" for "Board of Customs,"
in view of the fact that the last mentioned
board is now defunet.
The Act has been reviscd with an eye to the
undertakings Canada gave at Geneva, under
Section VII nf the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade, concerning the basis nf
valuation for duty of imported goods. The
wvording nf the Act bas been changed to
eliminate any confliet with these undertakings,
but the changes so made are not of a substantial character. Whatever the final status of the
General Agreement may he, the clauses are
considered desirable from an administrative
point of view. I arn advîsed that whihe they
are not ni a material nature, they contribute
in every respect to lessening the barriers on
the importation of gonds.
Honourable senators will recaîl that under
the protocol ni provisional application nf the
agreement, signatory nations were required
by January 1, 1948, to put into etTect, as far
as was possible under their executive authority, the code of trade practices contained in
part Il nf the General Agreement. Accordingly, the changes in customs valuation embodied in tbis bill have been in effeet by
order in council since tise beginning of this
year. It is now proposed to write them into
the statutes. Other signatories nf the protocol
have taken reciprocal action, notabiy the
Government nf the United States, which has
made certain changes in customs administration under its executive authority. Needless
to say, they are lîmited to changes in
administrative practice, and do not include
those that would require consideration of
Congress.
I may add that the bill as introduccd ln the
other place contained a section arising directly
out of our Geneva undertakings affecting the
customs treatment ni certain gonds subject to
British preference. This clause proved to be
contentinus, and the minister consented ta
remove it irom the bill because it was not
immediateiy necessary.
The motion was agreed, ta, and the
was read the second time.

He said: Honourable senators, as this bilt
involves certain technicat points, I intend to
avait myseif of the legat talents of the honourabte senator frorn Toronto (Hon. Mr.
Haytten). I arn sure that he can explain the
bitl better than I could.
Hon. SALTER A. HAYDEN: Honourable
senators, the Agricutturat Prices Support Act
was passed in 1944. Section 9 provided for the
powers of the board.
Section 12 provided that a proclarnation of
the Governor in Council woutd fix the date
when section 9 ivas to corne into force and the
tirne thal it shoutd rernain in force. A proctarnation issued on the lst of Aprit, 1946, brought
section 9 into force for a period of two years
froma that date. When the two-year period
expired, on the 31st of Marcb, 1948, the governrnent endeavoured to have section 9 continued in force by a further order in councit,
but it was found that thjs coutd not be tegatty
done. Hence we have this bill, which says
that section 9 of the Act shatt be deerned to
have continued in force from the 31st day of

INTERNATIONAL WHEAT AGREEMENT
MOTION FOR APPROVAL

The Senate resumed from ycsterday the
adjourned debate on the motion of Hon. Mr.
Robertson:
That it is expedient that Parliamient do
approve the International Wheat Agreement
ai)ened for signature at Washington o)n Mar-eh
6, 1948, and that the Senate do approve the
saine.
Hon. J. P. HOWDEN: Honourable senstors, since the bouse adjIourned yesterday afternoon I have gone over this wbeat agreement
and also hiave nd(eaý oure-d to i efresh my
memory about matters connected with the
grain tiade; but after due consideration Il concludcd that I was nlot in a position to throw
much light on the agreement and that therefore it would be folly for me to burden the
bouse with lengthy remarks. I find myseif in
substantial agreement with the leader of the
goverament (Hon. Mr. Robertson) and the
leader of the opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig), who
differed onlv in that one favoured the agreetuent altogether, wlirreas the other 'vas not
sa favourably inclined towards it.
Honourable senators, it is purely and simply
an agreement; it is not a contract. I migbt
Say it is a gentlemen's agreenîr ut. Ba-ed on
thýe principle of "bctter hiaif a loaf than no
bread", I oni inerlined to support the agreement. The couintries which are prepared to
produce and sell whcat have agreed with the
buying countries to supply 500 million bushels
at stipulated prices and under certain conditions.
One should compare the present conditions
respecting the wheat trade with those of the
thirties, wben the farmers; burnt their grain
for fuel and Canada biad aeeumulated 500 or
600 million bushiels of unsaleable wheat. Surely
it is better to enter inta an amicable arrangement with these countries who are prepared
ta buy aur wheat than ta return to the conditions of the thirties. At that time the people
overseas were starving for wheat and were
blaming the shortage on economic nationalism. I think that certain elements in the
Canadian grain trade were to some extent
blameworthy for those conditions.
It was commonly rumoured on the streets of
the city from whieb I come-so frequently
referred ta by the honourable leader opposite
-that certain persons engaged in the wbeat

trade bad put their heads together with some
American operators and agreed to corner the
wvheat market and control the price. We ail
kaow the resentment that engendered on the
part of the nations across the sea. We also
knnw that England plowed up bier vacant land
for the purpose of securing ber own food
supply, and that IIaly utilized bier vineyards
for tbe growing of wheat. I tbink that if the
proposed arrangement is not entirely satisfactory to tbose engaged in the wbeat trade,
tbey themselves are ta saine extent to blame.
Tbe proposed agreement is the resuit of the
best efforts of many eminent inidividuals wbo
are trying ta avoid a recurrence of tbe conditions wbicbi prevailed in tbe tbirties. Even
beforc tbe tbirties tbe grain trade was not
good. Surely sucb an agreement is ta aur
advantage and wortb wbile.
Hon. R. B. HORNER: Honourable senstors, I have only a few words ta add ta the
debate. I came from Saskatcbewan, wbicb
produces more wbcat than any other province in Canada, and for the past, forty years
I myself bave been struggling ta grow wheat.
I bave always been amazed at, the strong
iaterest of people wbo do not grow wheat ia
bandling it or giving it away. I sbould like ta
ask the leader of the government whetber over
the 1)ast fexv ycars the lake shippers, the railways and the brokers have made a sacrifice
comparable ta that of tbc wbeat farmers. I
remcmber the time when Swedisb bottoms
carried wbeat from Fart William ta Liverpool
for five cents a bushel. The rate on the lakes
is naw about ten cents a bushel, and apparently that is not enough.
Tbe question of tbe transportation of grain
is of cansiderable interest ta me. Honourable
senators wlio are not familiar witb distances
in the West sbould take note tbat ail agreemonts are based on price at Fart William. The
producers in my province, whetber their product is sbipped ta Vancouver or Fort William,
pay more freiglit than anyone else. We are
about baîf way between tbe two points. Due
ta the difference in freight alone, a shipper
from Winnipeg would get at lest ten cents
a busbel more tban I would get.
This agreement only indicates an intention
ta do sometbing. As tbe previous speaker said,
it is not a contract. Because of tbe difficulty
of producing wheat from year ta year it ma '
iveli be necessary ta vary the price. While I
am not arguing against stabilizing tbe pri'.e
for tbe western farmer, I am not entirely satisfied with the prices that are put forward in
the agreement.
The honourable senator from St. Boniface
(Hon. Mr. Howden) spoke about the bad conditions of the tbirties. Tha-e conditions were

JUNE 24, 1948
brought about by the fact that we had no0
trade agreements, and that such countries as
France and Germany had tariffs against our
wheat.
Hon. Mr. HOWDEN: The grain trade went
bad before the depression.
Hon. Mr. HORNER: While I arn not deiending the grain tradeHon. Mr. ASELTINE: You mean the pool.
Hon. Mr. HORNER: -I tbink the fact that
-we had no trade agreement was to blame for
those conditions. The whole world was in a
state of stagnation at tbat tim.e. I think it was
in 1932 that wheat bit its low point. I know I
sold some at 64 cents and some at 70 cents.
About that time I visited Iowa, and the corn
growers of that state bad the biggest crop in
their history. Their cribs were full, but there
was no market for it. I asked one grower if be
,could not seli some of bis corn. He replied,
that a few feeders would buy some at seven
cents a bushel.
I arn tired of bearing the party I bave bad
the bonour to follow criticized because of conditions in the hungry tbirties. The few Tories
in Canada did not control the wbole world, but
they bave been blamed for a world condition.
Hon. Mr. HOWDEN: I did not blame the
Tories.
Hon. Mr. HORNER: This agreernent looks
to me like so much camouflage. We bear great
stories about tbe international wheat agreement that the government bas presented. I
point to tbe Bretton Woods Agreement concerning money matters and ask honourable
senators what it bas amounted to. What power
bas a small country like Canada to enforce the
terms of the agreement, even if we do ratify
it? I tbink it is so mucb wbitewash.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE:
wash".

You mean "eye-

Hon. Mr. HORNER: I have no faitb in the
agreement, s0 far as we are concerned.
Hon. Mr. T. A. CRERAR: Honourable
senators, I fear tbat I must differ with my good
and genial friend from St. Boniface (Hon. Mr.
Howden). It is truc that tbe conditions which
obtained on the prairies in what are called the
black tbirties led to mucb discussion as to bow
a recurrence of those unfortunate conditions
could be prevented. But I think it is wbolly
fallacious and mistaken to give the impression
or adopt the conclusion tbat tbose conditions
were in any way due to grain traders in Canada
and elsewbere putting their beads together in
a sort of conspiracy against the world. That is

649

not so. The adoption by European countries
of flagrant policies of political and economic
nationalism, was the main factor which contributed not only to the low price of wheat in
the thirties but to the great depression wbich
swept over the wbole world at that time.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Hear, hear. Hear, bear.
Hon. Mr. CRERAR: Countries like France,
and particularly Germany and Italy under
totalitarian regimes, raised to prohibitory
levels tbeir tariffs against the importa-tion o!
foreign wheats; and naturally, wben these
insuperable barriers were erected by countries
upon wbich we largely depended for the sale
of our surplus production, our wheat did not
move normally in the ordinary channels of
international trade. It is quite truc that these
European countries plowed up their parks
and their grass lands and cultivated wbeat,
and the reasons are those tbat I bave just
given; but behind this policy, unquestionably,
was a fear in the minds of -their goveruments
that if another war should happen to break
out, they would be unable to feed their
peoples. The measures they adopted were
intended to provide against that contingency.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Hear, hear. I bave made
that speech a dozen times.
Before the honourable senator continues,
may I ask bima what organizations in the
early thirties held large amounts of wbeat in
Western Canada and got caught very badly.
Hon. Mr. CRERAR: I know the organizations which my honourable friend bas in mind.
I think it is bistorically correct to say that
in 1928. and 1929, particularly, and also in
1930, the wbeat pools of Western Canada
tbought they could override the old economnic
law of supply and demand, and, by holding
back wheat fromn the market, push the price
upward. 0f course in the end that policy was
bound to fail; but it failed largely for the
reasons I stated a moment ago.
Hon. Mr. HOWARD: What the bunourable
senator says does not apply only to wbeat.
Hon. Mr. CRERAR: Let us take a look at
the agreement which at the moment is before
us. It is not a product of recent vintage;
indeed it migbt almost be said to be "lost in
the mists of antiquity". At any rate, the
story extends back at least fifteen years. I
would remind my honourable friend t.he leader
of the opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig), who was
very critical in bis remarks about the agreement, that it was the government whicb he
supported, and which beld office from. 1930 to
1935, that set Canada upon the course of trying to get an. international wheat agreement.

SENATE

In 1933 tHe four large exporting countries,
narnely Canada, the United States, Australia
and Argcntina, sought to arrive at an international wheat agreement which wouid solve
ail the problems of producers and consurners.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Won't yuu let mie be
wrong once in a while?
Hon. Mr. CRERAR: Yes, I arn quite willing to concedo that rnuch. The story is an
interesting eone, and I think I could talk for
at least half an hour about the many atternpts
which were made to bring about a wheat
agreernent. The jdea had its gencsis in 1933
in the city of Washington, and was the
produet, of the fertile
imaginations
of
economic plaçnners who had neyer grown ani
neyer marketed a bushel of whcat, but whîî
deerned thernselves capable of solving this
great problemn. From that tirne to the present,
effort after effort has been made to bring
about an international wheat agreement.
Heretofore aIl tliese attempts bave failed; and
as to tbe prescnt agr-eernent I arn not nearly
s0 optirniistie or so bopeful as was the honourable leader of the government (Hon. Mr.
Robertson), who introduced it ycsterday.
Hoii. Mr. HIOWARD: It is just a start.
Hon. Mr. CRERAR: The fondamental
difficutty. of couri'e, is tbat. îin bringinit
toge.theî' exporting countries and censuming
counitries. vou are endeavoîîring to renrile
two whollv confliciîtng and oppio'ýci interests.
Naturally the exporting countries wisb t.a
secure as gond a price as possible for their
producers of wbeat. No less naturally and
undcî'standably, tlie importing countries want
to bu 'v wheat as cheaply as tlicy can. So, in
ail the-e confercnces--I do not know how
rnany bave been hield-one fincîs this process
of sce-sawing between consumner and producer. But apparently, in tbe measure before
us, that difference bias been to some extent
overcorne.
As thc leader of the opposition (Hon. Mr.
Haig) statcd yesterday, the agreement covers
a total of 500 nmillion buslîcls. That arnount
is less than one-tentb of the total wheat production of the world.
A nîorent's attention slîould be given to
the tbirtv-three irnporting countries which
bave s;gned the agreement. Who are they?
First in alphabetical order is Afghanistan.
That state hias undertaken to pureliase the
magnificent total of three-quarters of a million
bushels.
In this list I observe five importing countries
which are going te purchase under a million
bushels. Tbe prize goes te Liberia, a country
situated sornewhere in the western part of

Africa. Liberia bas agreed to purchase only
37,000 bushels, ivbich even the warrnest advorates of the agreement will admit is, fot of
much importance. This list shows onîy two
or tlîrec couatries which would be cf any
real value to Canada as substantial outIets for
our wbeat production. What guarantee have
wc that these countries will live up to their
obligations? I searched the agreement from
beginning to end. but nowhere did I flnd any
siigge:stion that a penalty or sanction would be
irnposed if a country defaulted on its part of
the agreement. Let us take a country likeHon. Mr. H'AIG: Czechoslovakia.
Hon. 'Mr. CRERAR: No, I arn net taking
Czechoslovakia. 1 shaîl use a better illustration. Let us take n country like Colombia in
Soutb Amnerica. That country pledged herself
to p'irchase several million bushels of wheat
uoder tlîis agreement. Supposing six months

again as she was befoe the first World War.
Suppose tha-t Argentine crops are rather plentif'il and that she effers te seli wlîeat te Italy at
15 or 20 cents a butshel cbeaper than Italy
cocîld buy it under this agreement; and let us
imagine that Italy is hard-pressed for fereign
exehange, as she will be for rnany years te

bind Italy, or ether counitries in tue sarne
positien, te carry through their part of the
agreernent. 1 think I arn weli wit.hin 'the rnark
w'bcn I say that the whole agreemnent rests on
a flirnsy and shadowy feundation.
Hon. Mr. HOXVDEN: Weuld the honourable senator suggest any means by which this
countr'y could be forced te buy the wheat?

JUNE 24, 1948
Hon. Mr. CRERAR: Yes. You could send
a navy Vobombard their coast or an army Vo
invade their country. I know of no Cther way.
unless you applied economic sanctions against
them. That probably would nat bother themn
very much, and Vo do it, agreement would have
to be reached among ail the contractîng countries. Honourable senators, I think it is foolisb
Vo enter into agreenments unless there is a
reasonable prospect that tbey wilI be carried
through.
1 also have criticismn Vo make of tbe ternis of
the agreement. The maximum price of the
wheat under the agreement is $2 a bushel. If
Canada, Australia and the Uni ted States finally
go into this, at no tume during the currency of
the agreement can they get more than $2 for
the quota Vhey have agreed Vo supply under it.
Hon. Mr. EULER: Does the honourable
senator Vhink it possible that Canada would
noV live up Vo the agreement, and would refuse
Vo seli the wbeat under it because she could
.sell at a higher price Vo somcbody else?
Hon. Mr. HOWARD: No.
lion. Mr. CRERAR: I would noV make a
comment on thjat.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: You would noV want
to admiV that anyway.
Hion. Mr. CRERAR: No, as a good Canadian 1 would noV want Vo admit that.
Hon. Mr. EULER: My thought was that if
one side did noV want Vo live up Vo the agreemient the other &ide would not, bave Vo.
Hon. Mr. CRERAR: The floor price changes
year by year until 1935, when it goes down Vo,
31.10.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: That is f.o.b. Fort
William.
Hon. Mr. CRERAR: If during the next
four or five years there is a world faîlure of
wheat crops and that commodity becomes
scarce, the market demand will be srong.
Outside of this wheat agreement prices will
go up Vo, say, $2.50 or $3 a bushel, but under
the agreement we would be still committed Vo
scil our wheat at $2 a bushel. We had an
experience of that under our wheat agreement
with the United Kingdom. The UniVed Kingdom wheaV agreement was a short sale of 600
million bushels of Canadian wheat, Vo be
delivered over a period of four years. We had
Vo honour our part of the agreement; we
could noV do otherwise because the good faith
of Canada was pledged. In the first two years
of the contract we sold wheat Vo Great Britain
at 81.55 a bushel. In the next crop year, coinmencing August 1, we wîll geV $2 a bushel.

651

What we shall get in the final year remains to
be seen. In my judgment, the farmers of this
country who produce wheat have lost, since
the beginning of the United Kingdom wheat
agreement, through Canada honourably living up to it, over $300 million. The bread
consumers in Great Britain were subsidized
because Britain, while buying wheat fromn
Canada on a basis of $1.55 a bushel at Fort
William, was paying more than hall as mucb
again for supplies secured outside of Canada.
NoV only did we subsidize the bread consumers in Britain, but we subsidized the
bread consumers in Canadanon. Mr. HAIG: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. CRERAR: -because the flour
that was converted into bread and sold Vo,
Canadian consumers was made out of whcat on
the basis of $1.55 a bushel.
Hon. Mr. HORNER: There was one time
when the basis was 75 or 78 cents.
Hon. Mr. CRERAR: And I think it was
81.25 in the first year.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: The honourable senator
from Churchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar) made a
statement that I think is factually incorrect.
I know hie did noV do so deliberately. During
the first year of the United Kingdom wheat
agreement the bakers of Canada paid only 77
or 78 cents a bushel for their wbeat, and the
difference bctween those prices and $1.25 in the
first year and $1.55 in the second year, was
made up by the rest of Canada.
Hon. Mr. CRERAR: Of course that bonus
had dbtained for years. The point I arn
endeavouring Vo make is ùhat the farimers
received. -the flhsV year 31.25, 1 VhinkHon. Mr. ASELTINE: IV ýwas $1.35 the
first year and then $1.55.
Hon. Mr. CR.ERAR: Ye.s. And I called
attention to the fact that the bread consumers of Canada got the benefit of those
prices, because Canadian milîs were charged
for their wheat the saine price as was iehargeil
to Great Britain. I venture Vo prediet that
in a few years' time parliament may hear
about that. My contention 'bas always been
that if, as a matter of high public policy,
-Canada desired Vo assist Great Britain by
providing hier with wheat at a reasonable cost,
the wheat growers should not have been asked
Vo bear tJhe whole burden, but that it should
have been di.stributed over the whole population.
Hon. Mr. HORNER: Hear, hear.

SENATE

Hon. Mr. CRERAR: I have said enough,
I think, to indicate to honourable senators that
I am not at all enamoured of this agreement.
As a matter of fact, I do not think the agreement will ever come into effeict.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. CRERAR: I say that for this reason. The United States Senate, af ter having had
the matter under consideration for some little
time, failed to ratify the agreement. There
is hope that the Senate wiil ratify it, but
I venture to think that in the light of existing political conditions in the United: States
there is not a very good chance of ratification
by the United States Senate.
Hon. Mr. DAVIES: As one who know-s
nothing about either the growing or the
marketing of wheat, but is very interested
in this debate, may I ask the honourable
gentleman what he suggests as an alternative
to this agreement?
Hon. Mr. CRERAR: First I want to continue my remarks. I have just pointed out
that up to the present time the United States
have net ra-tified ithe agreement. Australia
bas ratified, bat its ratification is conditional
upon ratification by the United States. Personally I should like to have seen in this
agreement a provision of that kind applying
to Canada, altbough I do not know that it
matters a great deal. Certainly, if the United
States fail to give ratification, the agreement
will fall by the wayside.
The qucstion rais-ed by my honourable
friend from Kingston (Hon. Mr. Davies) is
an interesting one, but let me ask this: Can
we in the long run treat wheat any differently
from any other commodity?
It may be
approaching hereSy to ask that; but I have
alhays believed that through the development
of their co-operative organizations the wheat
produces particularly those in the West. could
cut the cost of marketing to the lowest possible
point. They could, if they wished, ultimatelv
control the marketing of wheat. Indeed. with
the power that they have got they could, if
properly organized, do that today.
I think, too, that our wheat producers need
to pay a great dal more attention than in
the past to the costs of producing wheat;
and in those costs I include effieiency in
management and sound farming practice as
two of the important factors. In the future
are we going to the subsidizing of wheat?
I do not knoxw. But I think that if we enter
upon that pathway it will lead us to a great
deal of trouble. I am one of those who believe
that a government cannot play favourites.
You cannot hold an umbrella over wheat

without holding it over oats and, barley; nor
over grain and not over livestock; nor over
grain and livestock and not over fruit. The
danger -is that iif we start in that direction
we shall become enmeshed in a system of
government controls, and that finally the
government will have to assume all control
over all production andi -tell every producer
what he bas to do. That is something that I
hope will never happen in this country.
I am afraid that I have spoken rather discursively. I do not think this agreement will
amount to anything.
In the end it will
probably be about as successful as the
fabled pursuit of the Holy Grail, sought after
by many earnest mon. but always without
avaiL.
Hon. FRED W. GERSHAW: Honourable
senators, I realize that those who have already
spoken in this debate are miuch more icompetent to speak on the wheat question than I am,
but there are a few points that have not as
yet been brougbt out. In the first place,
ropresentatives of thirty-six countries gathered
to make this agreement, and I think we must
assume tha-t cach representative had his
country's welfare at heart. And while there
has ibeen a good deal of criticism of the
prices fixed for wheat, I think we must take
it for granted that our ropresentatives got
written into the agreement the best prices
that it was possible for them to obtain. It is
of course unfor-tunate that Russia and Argontina. wheat exporting countries, are no-t parties
to the agreemrnt.
For au long as I can
remember, the whcat producers and officials
of thcir organizations hiave been dissa-tisfied
with the methods of marketing grain. They
have always felt that unduly large profits were
made by the handlers of grain-by speculators
if you will-on -the grain exchange, and that
the producers did net get a fair reward for
their work. As the honourable senator from
Churchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar) pointed ont, for
fifteen ycars they have been advocating iiternational agreements as means of stabilizing
the wheat priec. They have argued that
agreements fixing prices for certain diefined
periods would be advantageous alike to selling
coun'tries and buying countries. The honourable gentleman recalled having sold wheat
for as little as 17 and 26 cents a bushel at
the place of production.
Other ruinously
low prices have obtained from time to time,
and I take it that the agreement before us
represents a sincere effort to fix ceiling anti
floor prices for our exportable surplus of
whbeat over the next five years, so that during
that period our producers may be able to look
forward ·to some measure of stability.

JUNE 24, 1948
A good deal bas 'been said about the losses
sustained by our prodRuiers because of the
United Kingdom wheat agreement. Certainly
there have been some losses, but we must
renmember it has been sta;ted that no country
received- a higher price fur its 194,5 crop th-an
Padticipation profits on the
did Canada.
1946-46 crops are stili to be paid, so it wouid
seem that as yet we are hardly in a position
to speak definitely about losses under that
agreement. Besides, there may be some question as to. whetheT Chicago quotations on
wheat correctly represent worid prices.
On two occasions during the debate question has been raised as to. whether the countries
whose representatives have signed the agreement will carry it out. There is always some
doubt about any hargain. We should at least
assume that these countries are acting in good
faith, and that unless something unforeseen
tuLppens they will honour their agreement. I
would not like to think that the standards of
the world have so deteriorated that a country
will kee.p jts ag-reement only when it is advantageous to do so.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: May I ask the honourable gentleman a question? This agreement
provides that Czecboslovakia is to take a
certain quota of our wheat. Do you think she
will buy bier wheat from us or from Russia?
Hon. Mr. GER.SHAW: I am sure some other
hionourable senators are better qualified than
I arn to answer that question, but I assume
that when our representatives sat acrosa the
table from tbe representatives of Gzechoslovakia and negotiated this agreement, they were
sati4zied that it would be carried out.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: But that country is now
uinder another government.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Question!
Hon. WISHART McL. ROBERTSON:
Before the question is put I wish to say a
word or two. 1 would remind the honourable
leader opposite (Hon. Mr. Haig) that I
prefaced my earlier remarks by saying that
because of certain difficulties I was not at ail
sure that the agreement offered the 'best possible solution. In challenging the agreement
and the able pamphlets which have 'been prepared on it without suggesting some alternative, my honourable friend is assuming a great
responsibility. In this connection the honourable senator from Kingston (Hon. Mr. Davies)
put a most pertinent question to the honourable gentleman from Churchill (Hon. Mr.
Crerar). The view of the leader opposite
seems to he that we should continue indefinitely the policy with respect to wheat, and
other matters, which was followed in 1929 and

1930. It is my humble belief that if society
and governments are not able to work out
somne better arrangement than existed thený,
we are in for serious consequenees. I agree
with anyone who says that the hest possible
solution would be to put wheat trading on a
world-wide multilateral basis, thus permitting
tbose countries which have wheat to trade it
freely with other countries in exchange for
their goods.
Hon. Mr. CRERAR: That is the only solution.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: But the view that
we should do nothing because this agreement
does not present a perfect solution, does not
meet with the approval of the vast mai ority
of Canadians today.
It may be the policy of the party opposite
to bow down to private enterprise, and to, look
upon the conditions in 1929 as being ideal.
If that is the policy of my friend's party it
is a dangerous one, and I suggest that that may
be one of the reasons why the fortunes of the
party are so low today.
The leader opposite said the otber day that
there had recently been a black Tuesday for
both the old parties in Canada. I believe it
was considerahly blacker for my friend's party
than for the party to which I helong. The
Honourable George H. Murray of Nova Scotia
used to say that a government began to, die
the day it was formed. It would he unnatural
if the governmcnt which had the responsibility
of administering the affairs of this country
throughout the war and afterwards did not
meet with at least temporary sethacks as far
as the electorate is concerned. I had some
experience in political matters hefore I became
a member of the government. For a time, I
was president of the National Liberal Federation, and as such visited ail parts of Canada.
For about eigbt or nine months before the 1945
election took place I heard so much complaint
about price control. beer control. conscription
and other questions that I thought the Liberal
party was going to be obliterated at the polîs.

ýHon. Mrs. FAýLLIS: May I ask the honourable senator what his remarks have to do with
the resolution? He is making a speech that
should be delivered on the hustings and not in
the Senate of Canada.

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: 1 arn answering
the honourabie leader opposite.
Hon. Mrs. FALLIS: The leader should
be answering the honourable senator from
Cburchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar), who is a member of bis own party.

SENATE

Haln. Mr. ROBERTSON: My friend frorn
Churchill rnay hold any vicws he wishes. I
arn sirnply pointing out the responsibility that
rests upon anyone who criticizes the agreernent
and faits to otTer an alternative proposai.
The leader opposite and rny friend from
Churchill both expressed a pessimistic view
about whiat the United States may do in the
way of ratifying the agreernent, and while I
arn no better qualified than they are to guess
at what that country will do, 1 would point out
that the progrcrn of the Republican party
todcy contemplates an agricultural support
act. That may mean that t.hey will buy certain goods from other couintries. If the tirne
cornes whien the United States bas a large
surplus of whect over its domestic requirements, the governrnent of that country would
be cornpelled to take the action wbicb thjs
agreemnent contemplates.
The leader opposite said that certain
counitries would buy wheat so long as the
United States gave them the rnoney to pay
for it. True, that hý the ternporary situation.
My fricnd from 'Churchill relerred to such
countries as Afghîanistan and Liberia. 1 was
surpriscd to hear ane who believes so fundarnentally in the principle of multilateral trade,
andl the removal of barriers, refer sligbtingly
to the buying lImIers of thcse small counitries.
I hope they wiii be able to buy our wheat
because we will buy their goods. Whether that
fan ho accomplislhed or flot, only tirne will
tell. But to criticize the agreemnent because
this or thait country has flot subscribed, is a
dangerous doctrine.
1 subrnit in ali sincerity that this country
owes a great deht of gratitude to the farmers
for their acquiescence in the prices obtained
for agricuitural produets. W~e can oniy hope
that normal conditions will soion return, and
that with the passing of these agreernents the
law of suppiy and demand wiIl becorne effective, to the great advantage of everybody.
The Hon. the SPEAKER:' Honoiirahle senators, is it your pleasure to concur in the
resolution?
The motion was agreed to.
IN-'COME T.R BILL
SECOND) READING
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON rnoved the second
reading of Bill 338, an Act respccting Incorne
Taxes.
11e said:
I biave asked the bonourable
senator from Inkerman (Hon. Mr. Hugessen)
to explain this bill. Before he dnn's so, miay
I address rnx',elf to a question wbieh va.s
asked by' an lu(nourable senator. and say that

as far as I know it is tho desire of the gos'ernrnent that the bill should be passed this
session. I regret exceedingly that it did not
corne to us sooner, but that is due to conditions wbicb are not under rny control. If,
afcer the explanction by the honourahie senatoe' frorn Inkerman, the house sees fit ta
give the bill second reading, it is iny intention to move that it be referred irnrediately
to the Standing Cornrittee on Bcnking and
Commerce. I would suggest that that camrnittee begin its work this evening, and mnasrnueh as practically all our other cornrittee
n oik lias been dispeardi of. tiî.t we sit toniorrow
inoiîning, tomorrow cftiernoon andi tomorrow
P'ecning. if nee-sarv. W'hat w'e do after that
mnighit be governed bî' eircurnsýtanees baving
relation to the time factor, or the pîrobable
dateC of prorogatlion.
Whiie the number of sections gives the bill
a, formidable appearance, tliose who are bettei
inforrned about it than I am advise me that
considerabie portions of the bill are in the
main reproduc[ions of tue exîsting aet. Probably these sections eoiild be disposcd of in a
mirnimnum of time ami the corniittee's atteiinion eonccntrated on the clauscs whie!h înibody
iewî riatter.
I wili conclude by rcxninding the biouse, as
I hiave donce beforr under siimiluur circenis: cus, that it is for tîuis bouse ta ciecide how
miuch tirne ive should ailot to thc consideratuon of the legîsîction before uis, ani we necd
not report back, nar concern ourselves about
prorogation, until we are through this business.
Io so daing Ive are acting withîn our powers.
I coi ready to do anything 1 can to expedite
eonsideration of the bill and ta provide ail the
turne theceonmnttee may require.
lion. Mi'. HAIG: May I be allowed ta say
aword about procedure? There should be a
conmaon understanding on two ai three
miat ters. Fir, aur consent ta second reading
shouild îlot be tcken as irnplying support of
the bill. becuse we have not bcd a chance
ta studv it. Second, there should be no
a ttempt i0 cornrnittee ta hurry the bill
thiaugli. My third suggestion is that, instcad
of the comrnittee beginniag its sittings this
afternoon, it should commence at 8 o'clock
this evening, and i'esurne tomorrow moroîog.
I do not intend ta speak an the subjeetmatter of the bill, but I believe 1 arn in ordeu'
in saying c word at this tirne. Although theî'e
aire prov isions in the bill whieh in my opinion
should be changed, I believe-and I think I
speak also for aur party-that it shouid be
passed this session if possible. My reason for
saing this is the~ fact that the bill wiii corne
into effeet on the first of January next, and between now and then the public should bave a

JUNE 24, 1948
chance to study and understand it. They would
then be in a position to suggest at the opening
of next session, whîch will neot be later than
January, what amendments should be made.
If we do nlot pass the bill at this session everything wiIl be "Up in the air" again.
I sincerely protest against a bill of this
importance coming clown at this time of the
session.
An Hon. SENATOR: That is not our fault.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: 1 know it is nlot your fault,
but it is the fault of the governrnent for flot
having brougit, it in earlier. It is flot right
that a bill of this kind should be introduced
in the closing days of the session.
The distinguished senator frorn Waterloo
(Mon. Mr. Euler) was chairman of a committee
on incarne tax which served over a period of
years and did a great job; and liaving read the
original draft of the bill, I arn persuaded that
in a good many af its recommendations it
embodies the conclusians of that committee.
I hope the leader of the government can give
assurance that we shail neot be bound by the
second reading of this bill, and that sufficient
time wilh be given to the committee to deal
with it.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I arn entire-ly in
agreement with those suggestions. I was inforrned that copies of the bill as amended
would be available a few minutes after the
liuse opened, but our staff work does nlot
seem to be as good as it should be, for the
copies have not yet been delivered. Under
the circurnstances the best I couhd do was ta
supply one copy each ta the leader of the
opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig) and the honourable senator fromn Inkerman (Hon. Mr.
Hugessen). I ask the indulgence of the liouse
ta permit the honourable senator frorn Inkerman ta make what I know will1 be a very clear
explanation of the measure. As soon as other
copies arrive they will be distributed.
Hon. A. K<. HUGESSEN: Honourable senators, this is a very important bllI, and one in
which I think the members of this bouse can
take a good deal of satisfaction. The honourable leader of the opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig)
referred to the special Senate cornmittee on
income tax which, under the able chairmanship of the lionourable senator frorn Waterloo
(Hon. Mr. Euler), sat during the whole of the
sessions of 1M4 and 1946. I think the leader
opposite is quite riglit in sa.ying, and I arn
right in repeating, that this bll resu'hts very
largely frorn the labours af that committee.
I propose as I go along ta refer to the work
af the committee in relation to the particular
features of the bull which I arn discussing.
5853--43

This is a bihl ta consolidate and to clarify
our income tax legishation. That is really a
prime necessity. May I remind the -bouse that
aur first incarne tax bill was introduced in the
year 1947? Every year since that tirne arnendments, some of great importance and sorne of
considerable cornplexity, have been stuck into
different parts af the act, until it has become
wliat I miglit almost describe as an amorphaus
and formless mass. This is the first attempt
in thirty years ta reduce aur incarne tax law
ta chear and ordered sequence. I do not thînk
we should underestirnate the difficulty whicli
faced the drafters af this bill in atternpting ta
ýbring that condition about. The bllI represents
the result ai years af work by depnrtrnental
officiais who were chargeýd wîtli the preparation
of it, and I 'think it is only fair to thern ta
offer tlier a-t this stage a word ai congratulation on the job which they bave managed
ta do.
May I refer for a moment ta the history ai
this measure? It was ahhuded ta by the leader
on the other side. Honourable memibers will
recail that it was introduced towards the end
of the session af 1947 by the Minister of
Finance. As lie then said, there wus na idea
of passing- it at that time: it was introduced
s0 that in the interval befare this session it
couhd be considered and digcussed in detail
by the public and, in particular, by the bodies
and the inidividuals that are specially interested in it. And that is just what lias happened. The Minister of Finance stated in
another place that since the introduction of
the bill in June 1947 lie lias received suggestions from coast to coast, ta quote lis own
words, "from practically every organized
group in the country". In lis statement the
minister referred particularly ta studies made
and ta suggestions received froin a number af
organizatians whose naines are familiar ta
this bouse as having appeared before aur coinmittee two years ago, such as tlie Canadian
Bar Association, tlie Dominion Association
of Cbartered Accountants, the Canadian
Chamber of Commerce. the Canadian Tax
Foundation, variaus Boards af Trade and a
nunaber of labour organizations. The minister
bas had the advantage of the representatians
made ta him by these various ladies since
hast summer, and the bill, revîsed and
improved, has taken shape in tlie present
measure.
I do not propose-I arn sure ta the relief
of my honourable friend-to go inta the bih]
in great detail. It is a camplex measure and
its details are more properly susceptible af
cansîderation in comrnittee. I shouhd like,
however, ta rernind the bouse af a few af the

SENATE

general objectives whicb the Senate commaittee, under the chairmanship of the honourable senator from Waterloo (Hon. Mr. Euler),
reported as being desirable, and to indicate
how far those objectives have been attained
in1 the bill nuw befure us.
In the first place, the cornmittee urged the
provision of cheap, easy and expeditious
machinery for appeals by taxpayers who feel
This is accomplisbed
themselves aggrieved.
by the setting up of the Income Tax Appeal
Board under the provisions to be found in
division I of the new Act at sections 76 and
t.hereafter. This board is to consist of flot less
than three and flot more than five members.
The important factor is that an appeal can be
lodged before the board upon dcpo'.it of as
littie as $15. Honourable members wvill recal
that in the special committee one of the greatest complaints hipard against the present Act
was that the Exebequer Court of Canada xvas
the only independent tribunal for heariog an
appeal. and in order te make an appeal to
that court a taxpayer bcd to give security to
the extent of $400, a suma beyond the means
of many people with small earnings in this
country. It is true that provision for this
Income Tax Appeal Board first appeared in
the budget legisiation of 1946, but the 'board
was flot appointed. This year the salaries
of the prospective members of the board
Ail one can say on
hav'e been increa--ed.
this branch of the subjeet is that the bill
now before us dots contain a satisfactory provision for appeal, ns urgcd by the Senate committee. I venture to hope that, there xviii be
ne furtb r clelay and that the Board of
Inconie Tax Appenis wviil be appointed
hxvitbi.
fort
The second objective whieh the Senate
committee consýidered te be desirabie was that
the incomne tax laixsbould be simpliied and
clarified. I repeat tbose twe words-simpiifid
and clarified-because they do not mean quito
the same tbing. 1 tlenk the draftsmen of
this mensure have sureeeded in elarifying tie
legisiation, but I doubt whcther they have
been able to mako it any simpler. I tbinkz
we have get to admit that in our modera
complex civilization you can only have two
kinds of income tax law: it can be simple or
it can ho just, but it cannot be 'botb. Let me
give an exampie of the sort of thing I mean.
1 suppose the simplest kind of ýncome tax iaw
would be one which declared that every citizen of the country s.houid pay ten per cent of
bis inceme te the govcrnment. That would
be simple, but 1 doubt whetber anybody
wouid say that it was ut
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: I arn sure a great
many people would say it was just.

Hon. Mr. HA'IG: The majerity would.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: I would be satisfied.
Hon. Mr. PATERSON: Se would 1.
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: I think my honourable friends are the exceptions that prove the
rule. A great majority of people when faced
with simipie income tax of that kind would
hegin te have these considerations in their
minds. Firstly, they would say it is nlot just
that a man witb an incorne of $2,OO0 a year
should pay tax at the sarne rate as the man
with an income of $20,000 a year. Therefore
yeu would put into your law a graduated scale
of rates. Then yeu wouid consider that a man
with a wife and family has more obligations te
fuifil than a single man witbout a family.
Therefore yeu would put inte your law provisions for a larger allowance te the married
man and an additional allowance for each
cbild that be bas te support.
Hon. Mr. HORNER: May I ask my bonourable friendHon. Mr. HUGESSEN: 1 weuld say te my
bonourable friend ýtbat it is ratber difficut-

Hon. Mr. HORNER: 1 wouid just like te
,ask my friend bow a single man can marry
when lie is taxed te such an extent tbat be is
unable te build a bouse.
Hon. Mr. HiUGESSEN: It is ratber difficult
to explain tbis eemplicated bill, and I weuld
appreciate it if honourahie senators would
w ait until I bav e finisbed bofore asking questions.

Then you would begin te say that there are
other people whe bave the same obligations as
a, man witb a fnmily-widows, widowers, and
people s.upporting children wbo are their relatiens. Se you would put in a provision te
give tbem the same sert of allowance as you
give te a married man. Tben ye.u would say
that, perbaps it was only fair that a man who
derives bis income from inberited wealth
shouldpay a little more tax than a man whose
entire ineome is derived from bis ewn exertiens. and yen wouid put an additional tax on
investment. incomne. Then ye.u would consider
wbetbcr it would net be advisable in tbe
public interest te encourage people te contribute te ebarities, and you would provide
tbat a certain proportion of income, if given
te charities, would 'be tax free. Tben there are
certain people witb wbom we are ail in
sympathy, such as the blind and agcd, and you
would make special provisions in fax our of
them. Again. some people are extremely unfortunate in that tbcy have unusuai medical
expenses te meet in the course of tbe vear,
owing te the illness of themsclves, their xives,

JUNE 24, 1948
or their families. So you would make a special
provision for them, and so on, and you would
go on revising the law. I think we all admit
that these are admirable and fair provisions,
and that by inserting them in the law we are
getting nearer and nearer to justice. At the
same time we are getting farther and farther
away from simplicity.
The examples that I have given only relate
to personal income tax; but in the field of
corporation income tax there are even more
complicated and difficult situations for which
you have to put into your law special and even
very intricate provisions. So I think we must
make up our minds that we cannot have an
income tax law which is at once simple and
just, and that the best we can hope for is
clarity. I think it will be generally agreed that
.clanity has been achieved in this bill. I feel
it is not too much to say that the Act, in its
present form, is a mess. The bill contains a
complete and logical re-arrangement of the
Act, and will at least make it nmuch easier hereafter to find particular sections of the law to
which reference is desired.
Now may I for a few moments refer to the
bill itself? It is divided into seven parts. The
first and by far the longest part, comprising
sections 1 to 95, deals with the income tax
itself; Part II, comprising sections 96 to 99,
deals with the tax on non-residents; Part III,
comprising sections 100 to 104, deals with the
gift tax; Part IV, comprising sections 105 to
124, deals with administration and enforcement; Part V, being sections 125 and .126, contains special provisions regarding tax evasion;
Part VI is the interpretation section, which has
been moved from the beginning of the Act to
section 127; and in Part VII, sections 128
to 131, there are certain so-called transitional
provisions.
Part I, relating to the income tax itself, is
subdivided into ten divisions, A to J, inclusive.
Division A is the base from which the whole
Act begins. That states, without qualification
or equivocation, the liability for tax:
An income tax shall be paid as hereinafter
required upon the taxable income for each taxation year of every person resident in Canada at
any time in the year.
In the interpretation section the words "resident in Canada" are defined as meaning "ordinarily resident in Canada"; and section 35 provides that an individual who is ordinarily resident in Canada for only part of a year may
deduct from the tax otherwise payable the
same proportion as the part of the year,
during which he resided outside Canada, bears
to the whole year.
Hon. Mr. DAVIES: Provided, I take it, that
he is liable for tax in another country.
5853-43J

Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: His liability for tâx
in Canada extends only to the portion of tse
year that he is normally resident here.
Division B, which runs from sections 3 tO 24,
contains the rules for computation of income.
The taxpayer is required to compute his annal
income, and these sections state what müit
be included as income, what need not bë
included, what things are allowable as deduitions from income and what are not allowable.
Then in division C, sections 25 to 29, there
are the provisions for computation of taxable
income. In this division are set out the
various exemptions allowable: such as, for
instance, the statutory exemption of $1,50 for
a married man or $750 for a single man; the
exemptions for charitable donations, unusüal
medical expenses, business 'losses, and so on.
By making the permissible deductions from
his annual income the taxpayer arrives at bis
taxable income.
Division D, consisting of section 30 only,
applies to the taxable income earned' in Canada by non-residents.
Division E, sections 31 to 39, contains rules
for computation of the tax. Here are set out
the rates of tax payable by individuals and by
corporations; and the provisions applicable to,
among other things, investment income, retirement allowances, deductions for provincial
income tax and for foreign income tax. And in
section 39 are complicated special provisions
allowing farmers and fishermen to average
their income over a five-year period.
Division F relates to the mechanics of tax
collection. This division, comprising sections
40 to 56, deals.with returns, assessments, payment and appeals.
Division G, which conists of section 57
alone, enumerates the individuals and corporations entirely exempt from income tax. Tb
list .of thcse exempted begins with the Governor General of Canada and includes municipal corporations, mutual insurance companies,
co-operatives, credit unions and the like.
The title of division H is "Exceptional cases
and special rules." A few moments ago I referred to the necessity of having a complicated
income tax law in our present economic strue,
ture, and division H strikingly exemplifies the
truth of that observation. The .division contains sections 58 to 75. Among the matters
dealt with are trusts and estates, personal corporations, investment companies, non-residentý
owned investment corporations, patronage divi:
dends, superannuation fiinds, superannuationi
or pension benefits, annuities, special provisions
in favour of authors and artists, ou *and.gas
wells, mining companies, and consolidated con,
poration tax returns by companies and their

SENATE

,subsidiaries. The provisions applicable to
these exceptional cases extend over 17 pages of
the bill.

SDivision 1 comprises the constitution and
functions of the Income Tax Appeal Board,
to which I bave already roferred, and the
general administrative provisions in regard

to it. Division J bas to do with appeals from
the

Income

Tax

Appeal

Board

to

the

Exchequer Court of Canada.
Looking at the bill as a whole, 1 think we
can truthfully say that the objects of the

Sonate

committee have

been achieved

as

respects the clarity and the logical soquence

of the provisions in
Chough, for the reasous
been impossible to do
simplification.
The third objective

the legisiation, even
I have given, it bas
much in the way of
to whicb the Sonate

committee directed itself was tbe elimination

of ministerial discretion.

We heard a groat

deal of evidence and many reprosontations
against the wide discretionary powers conferred upon the minister by many sections
of the presont Act. We were told, and I
think it is correct, that the presont Act con-tainsB more than a bundred instances in which
nh ministor may do varions tbings in bis
le
rabsolute discretion. Furtbor, we wvore tolti
that thoro was no uniformity in the manner
in which these discretions woro exercised and
that, tbeoretically at least, the minister bad
ïjhe power to discriminate between one taxpayer and another in the exorcise of bis discretions. We wore also told that wbere the
pdeart.ment bad exerçi.5ed discretionary powèrs under the presont A-ct, an appeal to tbe
minister simply mneant that the matter was
deaît with a second time by the official who
had exercised bis discretion in the first place,
and that it was most unlikely tbat ho would
overrule himself.
Honourable senators will find wben they
examine the bill that the objective of the
Sonate committoe in this respect bas been
entirely met. Ministerial dîscretion bas been
alm.ost ontirely eliminated. It bas been retained in only a f ew minor instances relating
to what 1 might caîl departmenta1 meobanios.
May I give the bouse one or two instances
of the way in wbicb the ministerial discretion
lias been eliminated, and indicate what bas
beon substituted for it? One instance is that

of interost on borrowed capital deductible
fromn income. Under section 5(l) (b) of the
present Act a deduction is allowable for:
,Such reasonable rate of interest on borrowed
capital used iu the business to earn tbe incomne
as the mninister in bis discretion may allow nutwitbstanding the rate et interest payable by

the. taxpayer...

Section 11(l) (c) of the bill provides that a
doduction shall be allowed for:
An amnoont paid in the year or paid in respect
pursuant to a legal obligation
of the year ...
to pay interest on borrowed money used for the
purpose of earning incomne from a business or
but, if the rate at which the
property . ..
interest wvas cornputed was unreasonably high,
ooly sueh part of the arnounit su paid or payable
as would bave been paid or payable if the rate
had been reasonable may be deducted.
The governing word in that provision is
"reasonable", and the effect of the change is
that if the taxpayer and the minister are in
disagreement as to wbether the rate of interest charged was reasonable, it does not fal
witbin the discretion of the minister to docide
the question. The minister and the taxpayer
must go together to the Income Tax Appeal
Board wbich, as an indopendent body, will
decide whethor or not the rate of interest was
reasonable.
A further oxample of the elimination of
ministerial discretion bas to do witb the
deduetion of bad debts from income under certain circumstances. Subseetion (1) (d) of section 6 of the picecnt law pots it in a negativo
,way. It provides that no doduction shall bo
made for bad debts...
... except sucb an amnount for bad debts as
the ininister rnay allow...
That left it to, the minister's discretion whether
and to what extent be would allow deductions
for bad debts. Under section 11(l) (d) of
the bill wo find an entiroly new provision. It
allows the deduction of:
A reasonable arnount as a reserve for
(i) doubttul debts that have been includcd
ia cornputing tbe incomne ot the taxpa3 er for
that year or a previous year.
Under section 11 (.1) (e) provision is made
for the dedoction of:
The aggregate uf debts owing to the taxpayxer
(i) that are established by hiin to bave becorne ha d debts in the 3 car.
Thiere again the matter of ministerial discretion i-s removed. If the minister and the
taxpaye.r are at odds as to wherher a d-ebt
is had or not, the question muost ho deeided
by the board. For instance, if a taxpayer
contends that he 'has established a bad deht
for the yea'r, and the minister says he ba-s
not, it is not a inatter for the discretion
of the minister, but must ho decided by the
tribunal set up under this legisiation.
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN:
that provision?

What section makes

Hon. M.r. HUGESSEN: Section il (1) (d)
and (e).
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: But my friend bas
said that if the taxpayer does not agree with

JUNE 24, 1948

the minister as to the reasonableness of the
rate of interedt or as to the reserve for bad
debts, the parties must go to the Income
Tax Appeal 'Board. Where is the reference
in the bill to that provision?
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: My honourable
What I meant
friend misunderstood me.
was that if the minister and taxpayer disagree, the minister has no discretion to fix
the amount of bad debts; and if they cannot
agree on an amount, the question can be
referred by either party to the board.
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: But where does one
find the section providing for that reference
to the board,?
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: The general section
which says that a taxpayer may appeal any
decision of the minister.
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: That is an appeal on
an assessment.
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: Yes.
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: But the assessment
is part of the minister's decision, is t not?
Hon. MT. HUGiESSEN: I suppose it is, yes.
So the minister
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN:
makes a decision as to the reasonableness in
the first instance.
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: Yes. He can make
that decision, but it is not final; and the
taxpayer may go to the board. In other words,
the ultimate and absolute discretion of the
minister is aboliÊhed.
We heard a good deal in the special conmittee on the question of allowance for
will
senators
Honourable
depreciation.
remember that the 'present Act puts it in a
negative form. Subsection 1 (n) of seotion 6
of the Act provides that no deduction from
income shall bc allowed for depreciation,
. . . except such amount as the minister in his
discretion may allow ...
Two objections to that provision were raised
before the special committee. The first was
that it was stated in a negative way, when in
fact depreciation is well recognized the world
over, and the taxpayer should have a positive
right to a reasonable allowance for it. The
second objection was that that section left complete discretion to the minister, who, theoretically, might favour one taxpayer at the expense
of another, and it was contended that in any
event there were no published rules or regulations showing just what amount oi depreciation ghould be allowable for any particular
class of the goods or articles. That point
is dealt with in the new bill, under section

659

11, subsection 1 (a), by çwhich it is provided
in positive terms that the taxpayer may
deduct,
. . . such part of the capital cost to -the tar

payer of property, or such amount in respect
of the capital cost to the taxpayer of property,
if any, as is allowed by regulation.
There.are two observations to be made about
that. In the first place, as I have pointed
out, it is stated positively, as a right of the
taxpayer to depreciation; and in the second
p!ace it provides for the fixing of depreciation
allowance by regulation. Mind you, it is a
regulation made by the Governor in Council.
In other words the minister is no longer free
to determine at his whim or caprice tbq
depreciation in each individual case. In futureî
general rules governing depreciation altowance applicable impartially to all cases will be
made by the Governor in Couneil, and will
be published for all to sec.
There are many other cases in whicb · the
miniSter's discretion has been got rid ofi but
these, I think, will be sufficient to indicate to
honourable senators the methods that have
been adopted for that purpose. Generally
speaking, I think we can state that the objections which have been made to the wide discretionary powers conferred upon the minister
by the present Act have been fully met in the
present bill, and to that extent the object of
the Senate committee has been achieved. In
fact, the question bas been raised whether
this bill does not go a little too far; whether,
in an attempt to get away from ministerial
discretion, we have not sacrificed to some
extent the flexibility which ministerial discretion has sometimes permitted, and thereby
made the Act a little too rigid. On that point
I think we can only say that we shall have to
learn by experience after the new bill comes
iito force and has been in operation for some
period of time.
Hon. Mr. DAVIES: I do not like to interrupt the honourable gentleman, but I should
like to know if the provisions of the bill apply
to assessments for, let us say, 1945 and 1946,
which have not yet been completed and
returned. Suppose there is disagreement about
these assessments; when the decision of thé
department is communicated to the taxpayer
will he have the right of appeal to this new
board?
Hon. Mr. HTGESSEN: No. As I read the
bill, the board and the powers of the board
will be effective only with respect to 1949 and
subsequent taxation years.
I have almost reached my conclusion. I
have attempted to relate this bill to the work
of the Senate committee, and to show that in

SENATE

three respects-the provision of easy and inexpensive appeals, the clarification and codification of tbe legisiation, and the doing away witb
ministerial discretions-the bill does almost
precisely what the Senate committee recommended. 0f course I could go on for hours
to discuss detailed provisions, if my physical
strength and your patience would permit, but,
as the leader on this side lias observed, it does
net seem necessary at this stage. Remember
that this bill is almost entirely a codification
and, a reclassification of our income tax law as
àt already exists, and does flot contain much
new law. In fact, if I may be allowed for the
moment to drop into metaphor, the bill is
largely our old friend the income tax, but the
lady is dolled up inl a new dress. We miglit
say that she bas acquired "the new look".
But, if you seek to penetrate beneath "the
niew look" you will flnd the saine formidable
and forbidding female to wboma ail of us have
b.een unwillingly paying alimony for these
mnany years past.
1There is one more word which 1 think should
be added on a point to wbich reference bas
been made by the leaders on bofli sides. The
bill comes to us at a period of the seýsion when
it is impossible for this house to give it that
careful and detailed consideration which it
deserves and which this bouse rather prides
itiself on giving to legisiation of this kind. On
the other band, we should bear in mind three
conisiderations. First, as the honourable leader
on the otber side pointed out, it bas already
been before the public for a year. Second, it
carnies into effeet many of the recommendations of our own committee of two years ago.
Third, as by its terms it does not come into
force before January 1, 1949. there will be
another six montbs in whicb to consider it.
On balance, therefore, 1 submit and I urge that
iL is to the advao-tage of the country that we
should pass tbis bill this session, even if we are
unable now to give it the dlean and detailed
scrutiny which it desenves.
May 1 conclude with one suggestion whicb
arises out of wbat I have just, said? Would it
4»ot be a good thing if at the beginning of next
session we were to reconstitute the Special
Income Tax Committee for the purpose of
examining closely into tbis new bill, of hearing
representations, of examining it in great detail,
and, if we find it desirable, of making further
recommendations for even more improvements
than are to be found in it at the presen-t time?
Hon. SALTER A. HIAYDEN: Honourable
senators, in the first place may I congratulate
the honounable senator who has just spoken
on the very able way in which bie bas
&eveloped the vaniotus aspects of this bill" At

the samne time may 1 point out that while bis
description of the bill as "important" is true,
it is a grave undenstatement?
The bill is
basic.
It provides tbe foundation for the
most substantial revenues that the country
gets fromn ils citizens; and having regard to
the fact that it is the source of the autbority
for taking money from, tbe people of Canada,
if we were to give the bill tbe consideration
to which its importance entities it, we should
need mucli more time tban is flOW available.
Ordinarily, in examining a mensure of tbis
kiod. our procedune wou]d be to consider tbe
provisýions of the bill itself; and, to the extent
that those provisions incorporated the principles already contained in our income tax
law, it would be our duty, in order to do a
tborougb job, to inquire into the value and
proprîety of continuing tbe meth&ds and the
principles of taxation contained in the original Act. At this stage of the session there is
no opportunity for us to do tbat. We must
approach the subject solely on the assumption
tbat wbat is, is good, and should be continued; and to the extent that there are
changes, we must, examine into the sufflciency
and the menit of those changes. In other
words, although the bill is described as botb
new aud basic, our approacli to it is no differçnt from our approacli to amendments introduced front year to year to the original Act,
We bave neither the opportunity nor the
tinte to develop, tbrough hearing evidence, a
satisfactory decision.
Whether or flot the
basic prineiples involved in this taxation bill
are the sounidest or the best, we have to
acccpt thent. We shaîl proceed fartber and
accept wvhat we find in the income tax law
as being a gond starting point. It may be that
it is, but surely if we consider a new Actwith emphasis on the word "new"ý-we should
give consideration to that aspect. But this
we cannot do now. I am not going to bemoan
the lateness of our receipt of tbis bill, because
it is typical of the kind of thing we have to
deal with every year. Towards the end of
each session we firmy resolve that this sort
of thing will neyer occur again, and that we
are going to stand on our rights and refuse
te, pass certain bills. But we still go on every
time and rush consideration of legislation.
Tbat is exactly what we are going to do now.
In the circumstances I suppose there is no
other course open, but 1 am sure that some
features of tbe bill are not going to receive
the consideration they sbould.
My bonouraible friend fromn Inkerman (Hon.
Mr. Hugessen) has suggested that we could
appoint a special committee next year. The
leader of the opposition bas said that as this
bill does not come into effect until January.

JUNE 24, 1948
1949, we shall have ample opportunity in the
session of 1949 to give study to amendments.
In ail seriousness I ask the practicability of
having amendinents made to a new income tax
law, which is supposed to be the foundation of
our tax law in Canada. We pass it now, but
we contemplate amending it at the very
moment it is coming into force. Would we
not then 'be asked te wait and see how the
statute worked and to gather some experience
before we started amending something so
sacred and important that it must be deait
with immediately? The laws of our country,
and the best interests of the people, require
that immediate consideration be given to this
measure. If we accept this principle, then we
cannot accept the principle that we should
amend it before it starts to work.
Honourable senators, there are one or two
points in the bill to which I should like to
refer. First of ail, there is no doubt that
the income tax law, in the form in which it
appears before us today, tremendously
improves the existing income tax law. I
think a simple way to describe it is that the
present Act just grew up something like
"Topsy". It is a mess so far as finding anything in it or establishing its year to year
continuity is concerned. The present bill is
orderly, and being arranged in sequence or
with continuity it is not difficuit to follow.
0f necessîty the language is such that it is
not always simple te ascertain what the liability is or what the incidence of taxation is.
However, the Act is at least definitely and
thoughtfully laid out, so that if an informed
person studies it he can easily follow the
course of taxation. I would say that those
persons charged with the responsibility of preparing this measure deserve the greatest commendation. Some sections of the bill are
beneficial, and others represent an effort in the
direction of tightening the vice upon a practice
that may have developed. I do not agree
wîth some of the sections, 'but I can discuss
them in committee.
I should like to refer for a moment to the
question of discretion. A great deal of discussion took place on this point when the
Senate committee dealt with the income tax
problem two years ago. The position I took
at that time-and I still take the same position
-was that discretion is a good thing to have
hecause it gives a flexibility to the statute that
it otherwise would not possess. Discretion,
which is the ability of a taxing officer Vo make
a recommendation in a special case, is a good
thing so long as the exercise of that discretion
is cireiimscrihpd in some way by the right to
have a check made upon it. The Senate committee put a check on the exercise of that

discretion by recommending the granting of a
right of appeal. The governinent went so far
as to provide for an Advisory Board which,
although it would have no power to make *a
decision, could deal with matters of discretion
and make recommendations Vo the minister,
that he might or might not accept. Ail that
has gone by the board.
My honourable friend who explained the bill
tried to find some virtue in the taking away of
this discretion. I usually find myself able té
agree with my friend, perhaps more often than
he is able to agree with me, but I amn sorry
that I cannot go along with hima on this point.
In the bill honourable senators will find these
words occurring: "as is reasonable", "by regulation"~, "improper", and "reasonable amount".
The bill does not say who is to determine these
things. It is the same old story of the exercise
of discretion by the minister. What is the
difference between the effeet of "as is reasonable"' and "in the discretion of the minister"?
The only difference is that, when you are
assessed, you now have the right of appeal on
your assessment, and that the question of the
reasonableness could be determined by the
Board. That is the only difference. At the
present ime an appeal can be made from an
assessment to the extent that the minister has
exercised, a diseretion. If we are able to show
that the reason given for the exercising of the
discret-ion is noV sound in law, then we have
the sa-ne ground of appeal as exists under the
new Act. The only difference between the two
therefore is that by removing the language "in
the discretion of the minister" and substituting
"cas is reasonable" etc., the matter of discretion
takes a new form; but under the "new look"', as
it was called by my honourable friend from
Inkerman, 'there still remains the same old
taxing master.
An Hon. SENATOR: The spinster.
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: Yes, the spinster. The
benefi-t of the change is simply that you wihl
not have to justify your appeal on the ground
that the minister either did not give reasons, or
that the reasons he gave were unsound in law.
It will be partially a question of fact and
partial11y a question of law whether the minister's determination of the existing rate is
"reasonable".
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: It extends the
grounds from law te law plus fact.
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: Yes. The present Act
provides for a Board of Tax Appeal; there la
a provision whereby a person can appeal his
assessinent Vo the Board of Tax Appeals
through the minister.
At this stage I arn not as familiar with the
statute as is my honourable friend who ex-

SENATE

plained the bill. He stated that the new board,
wben appointed, will flot be able te function
witbi respect to any appeals under the present
Act. That presents the most peculiar situation
in the world, because under the preSent Act a
mian has the righit of appeal to the Board. I
have nlot been able to find any provision in
the bill dealing witb that. Then a man is lef t
in this situation: as respects an assessment
under the present Act he has the rigbt of
appeal to a board, but this board is constitu'ted
under the new Act and bias flot got authority
to hear the appeal. If the fact is as mny honourable friend. represented it, wxeshah bhave to deal
witb it in committee.
There are many other provisions, particuIarly some that are labelled as new, which wil
require our careful consideration. Let me mention just one by way of example. A certain
section of the bill prox ides that once a taxpayer eleets te use a certain method for the
calculat-ion of bis tax, he will not thercafter
be allowed to change that metbod without tbe
concurrence of tbe minis-ter. It is a well known
principhe of taxing law that, so long as a man
keeps bimself w'ithin .tbe scape of the law he
bas a pcrfcct rigbt se to order bis business
affairs as to, be hiable for the least possible
amount of tax. I suggest tbat this new provision, w'bich would make it impossible for a
man when calculating bis tax te adopt-except
witbh ministerial approval-a metbod that he
considered te ho more to bis interest than the
metbod be bcad formerly used, is one te wbich
w e sbouhd give tbougbtful consideration.
Tbere are otber tbings that I sbould bave
liked te say at this time. I do not tbink any
useful purýpose would be served rby saying
tbem, tbougb, because in the main tbe bill is

good. There is no doubt that, in tbe first
place, it clarifies our tax situation. Secondly,
it re-encts possibly 75 per cent of tbe provisions in our present law. In some cases the
re-enactment is word for word, but in others
the pbraseology is cbanged. Tbere is of course
a special difflculty wben you eodify a law which,
like our income tax law, bas accumulated over
a long period of time. In the course of the
years thbe courts bave interpreted various sections of tbe Act, and their interpretations bave
become the law relating te the matters dealt
witb in the respective sections. Tbe difficulty
is te know wbetber in a new statute those sectioýns whicb apparently incorporate tbe substance of carlier ones do in fact mean the same
tbing ns tbe courts bave declared tbose earlier
sections te mean. However, that d-ifficulty is,
as it were, an inevitable penalty tbat must be
paid wben a new statute is drafted te replace
an old one. You can, neyer be sure just wbat
interpretation will be placed itpon amended
sections until the courts bave banded down
decisions.
Amy further comments tbat I migbt make
would relate te particular sections and could
be more appropriately expressed, in committee.
The motion was ngreed te, and tbe bill was
read the second, time.

SUMMARY

BY

Immigration Branch
Reports irom Dr. Keenleyside an Januamy
29, and June 15, together with statistical statements filed by Mr. Jolliffe on April 28, show a
marked increase in the number ai immigrants
admitted ta Canada. In several other aspects,
the general situation in respect ai immigration
bau greatly improved.
By Orders in Council-June 5, July 18, Qatober 1, 1947, and Order in Council P.C. 1628,
April 22, 1948, a total ai 30,000 displaced persans bas been approved. This number will be
additional ta those who came as close relatives. Regulations permitting the entry ai
British subjects irom the United Kingdom. and
the dominions, and, ai United States citizens,
continue ta operate.
The total number ai admissions for the fiscal
year 1947-48 is approximately 80,000, epresenting an increase ai 13,000 aver the year

SENATE

1946-47. 0f the 80,000, there were 45,000 from
the British Isles and 14,000 were displaced
persons. During the first four months of 1947
there were 10,900 admissions, while for the
first four months of 1948 the figure is 32,500.
Thirty-one thousand seven hundred applications for relatives in Germany, Austria and
Italy-that is for D.P. relatives--have been
received; 25,600 have bren approved and
approximately 8,000 relatives have already
arrived.
Transportation
Transportation facilities have been better
than was cxpected. Ships from the British
Isles to Canada provide four times as murh
space as there was last year. The Dominion
Govýernment has recentiy entered an agreement
with T.C.A. to provide 10,000 scats by air hy
the end of Marrhi 1949, at a flat rate of £72.
1.11.0. arranges transportation of D.P. and
the Beat'erbrae (converted German prize shîp)
carries about 770 relatives once every three
or four weeks.
Inlpt)Ction

During lihe ycar. the Imigration Branch
set- up, an office in Heideiberg, as headquarters
foi' wxork in the occupied territories. The number of immigration trams wxorking in these
areas lias been increased from six to eight, and
a ninth p)eripatetic toam will visit other countries to maize cxamnination of appi"ants. Probabiy the tram will first visit Sweden to investigate cases of Estonian and other Baltie
i efugees.
An immigration office bias bcen opened in
Rome. By P.C. 4850, peuple of Finland, Itaiy,
Hlungary and Roumania are, foi' prirposes of
immigration, nu longer considcred enemy
ai iens.
Immigatiun .c-XtDeportation
Tir Immigration Act hias bren amended
from tinte tu time. but tiiere hias bren no basic
change sinre it uns passed in 1910. A disrrîssien on depurtation prucedmîre showed tbat the
Art nu longer ronfurms to the scertifir
adx ance:> niade in the treatment of nervous
di5zeascs and tuberrulosis.
A perçson, other titan a Caandian citizen or
a person having Canadian domicile, may he
deported if be enterrd Canada iilegally, or if
ie bias been an inmnate of a jail, penitrntiary or
of a mental institution. Cases wrre citrd of
peuple wh'o, afier baving passed medicai examination for immigration to Canada, suffered
temporary nicnIai or nervous trouble. Upon
recovcre, tl.ey are subject to deportation.

Altbougb tbe minister may defer action, and
frcqnently dors on bumanitarian grounds if
tiere is nu question of the person becoming a
public charge, the persun can neyer secue permanient residence and become a citizen. There
have been cases uf irfuigees wliere wuriy and
unrertainty bave caused relapses.
It wzas suggested tbat the committre shoîild
recommend a study of the Art, and that
special attention bc given tu the question of
whether the power of the minister on appeals
should be inrreasrd, and rwhetber the Act
,sbould bc amendrd tu provide for application
for reronsideration of a deportation order,
afier a lapse of five or ten years.
C binese
A recomimendation for repral of P.C. 2115
was requested su tbat marrird men of Chinese
descent, resident in Canada, may be allowed to

Canadian retýidents of Europran, South Amenieaii or United States origin ran bring their
famnilies. but peuple of Asiatir race must be

the United Nations Charter and is nlot in

The placement of women in, domestic work
has been markedly successful. Honourable Mr.
Mitchell satid that there had been no trouble
whatsoever withi D.P. workers, and the committee has receivedi letters from employers,
stating that they have been satisfactory
workers and are fittàng: in well.
Can.idian Citizenship
The Canadian Citizenship branch in the
Department. of
the Secretary
of State
co-operates with government and privatc
agencies to assist the assimilation of xmmigrantýs. The process of assimilation is a grad-u-a
one. The ncwcomers cannot become Canadian
citizens immedlately, but if they are given
understanding help, they wilI develop an
affection and loyalty for their new homeland.
The immigrant must first learn to speak
one of our two languages. He sbould know
that he may indicate bis desire to become a
Canadian citizen by making a declaration of
intention as soon as he likes.
It is after these two stages are passed and
before he applies for naturalization that the
immigrant should be given an instruction in
Canadian bistory, geography, governmen-t, etc.
Immigrants from the United Kingdom must
be inchiuded at this stage for, although they
know the l-anguage and understand democratie
institutions, tbey do not know Canada. They,
too, wish to feel that they belong.
During ail three stages the immigrant will
need help, and the attitude of Canadians will
influence the degree and rapidity of assimilation. Most Canadians show sincere good wiIl,
and there are many private organizations ready
te help. There is need, however, of a dloser
co-ordination of the federal departmrents concerned in order to give clarification and leadership to the many agencies, public and private,
whose co-operation would be very valuable.
An interdepartmental co-ordinating committee mý*ght be set up witýh representatives of
the Immigration Branch, the Deipartment of

5853-444

6M

Labour, the Department of E:xtenial Affaiii,.
the' Department of «Heal-th and Welfare, aiÏd'
the Citizenship Branch.
Mention was. made of the language instrpcetion.provided by provincial goverpnments. .
Memnbers of the committee were.aware pf.
the po ssibility of undesirable influences on~
the immigrants through peopfe who speak
their languages. It was suggested that a fèw
travelling councillors on a ::temporary.basis,'
speaking the languages of the immiùgrante,
înight be appointed. T-hey coul give advice
and information and direct the immigrant to
the proper agency for bis particular needs.
International 'Refugee Orgaizhtion
The International Refugec Organization
bas one and a haîf million displaced persons
under its care. About 80ti,000 of these must
be re-settled. They are former residents of
Poland, Russia, Yugoslavia, Rumania and the
Baltic States who do flot wish to return to,
their homes.
I.R.O. bas decided against
foreible repatriation and that places an international humanitarian obligation upon member-nations
to accept
displaccd persons.
Canada is a membcr and therefore shares the
responsibility and the expense. It will cost
very littîs- more to re-scttle a man than to
keep hima in a D.P. camp for a year, but maintenance is a continuing expdnse.
I.RO. works now under great difficulty
hecause of its restricted funds. Canada bas
contributed $3,600,000 to a budget of $117
million. The committee felt that, altbough
Canada's contribution (a total of $5 million
for the ycar ending July 1, 1948) is comparatively good, the total is xvoefully sinall and
liamper., the work of P.C.I.R.O.
Appeal for Estonians in Sweden
When, in 1940. the Russians occupied the
Baltic countries, private property was confiscated and 320,000 persons were deported to
Russia. During the fa]] of 1944, when the
Russian front moved dloser to the Baltie
States for the second time, a large scale
evacuation took place by countless citizens
Who found ways and means to escape. Many
went to Sweden, and they now find thcmsoilves
in a less favoured position than those whi
are in occupied territory.
The Baltie refugees in Sweden are flot
technically displaced persons and are not,
therefore, eligible for inclusion in the emigration plans of I.RO. Yet they have suffered
for their opposition tu tutalitarianisin, and
they Pre averse to returnîng to Russian-con-

SENATE

The Baltic refugees in
trolled countries.
Sweden include textile, metal and construction workers of high standing, and experts in
poultry, horticulture, apiculture and dairying.
A statement by Dr. Keenleyside indicates
that, this situation is being given favourable
consideration by the Immigration Branch.
Recommendations
1. Continued expansion and activity of the
Immigration Brandi includingStudy of regulations concerning deportation.
Repeal of P.C. 2115-restricting Chinese
families.
Admission of Estonians from. Sweden.

2. Organization of a co-ordinatîng cornmittce with representatives from Immigration,
Labour, Health and Welfare and Citizenship.
3. Admission of a greater diversîty of occupational skills and some of the highly traîned
experts in the D.P. camps.
4. Strengthening of the work of the Citizenship Brandi, particularly in provision of educational material and liaison work.
5. Prompt and generous contributions to

I.R.O.
Ail of which is respectfully submitted.

Bon. Mr. ROEBUCK: Bonourable senators,
I should like to make a few comments; wjth
respect to the report, but unfortunately I will
not be present at the next sitting. Would it
flot be possible to consider the report today?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Honourable senators, I have no particular view as ta the procedure to be followed under the circumstances.
I understand that the honourable senator from
De Salaberry (Mon. Mr. Gouin) will not be
prepared to give his explanation of the report
until tomorrow.
Bon. Mr. GOUIN: I would ask that I be
allowed to offer my explanation tomorrow,
when I shahl move concurrence in the report.
The Bon. the SPEAKER: The report is a
long one. The honourable senator fromn
De Sahaberry has asked that it stand for consideration tomorrow. This wihl permit of its
being printed in the record.
(See Appendix at end of today's report.)
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Postp oued until tomorrow.
Hon. Mr. BORNER: Wouhd it flot he possible to allow the honourable senator from
Toronto-Trinity to speak today? The debate
couhd then be adjourned until tomorrow.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: The report is not

667

merely been presented, and wihh be printed.

Whether the honourable senator from TorontoTrinity shouhd be granted leave to speak today is for the Senate to decide.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Tomorrow I
Hon. Mr. VIEN: Honourable senators,' I
think we shouhd allow the honourable senator
for Toronto-Trinity to, proceed today. The
debate couhd- then be adjourned on the understanding that the honoura;ble the chairman of
the comrnittee may make whatever explanation

The Bon. the SPEAKER: If that course is
to be followed, the honourable the chairman of

explanation.
The Bon. the SPEAKER: With heave of the
Senate, it is moved by Senator GouinBon. Mr. BAIG: Excuse me, honourable
senators. I have no objection to the honourable member for Toronto-Trinity speaking to
the motion, but I would point out that by
alhowing him to do so we are establishing a
most dangerous precedent. The members of
this bouse bave not had an opportunity to read
the report. Further, when I wished to speak on
the Dominion Elections bill the other day My
fiiend from Toronto-Trinity objected on the
ground that no motion had beeu made, and
I was not allowed to speak. A ruling which

the other day was good for my honourable
friend from Toronto is today good for me.,
I have not read the report, and therefore arný
not prepared to go on, nor to listen to a discussion of it. Furthermore, I do not believeý
that we should discussi a report until we have

had a chance to read it and judge for ourselves,
as to its merits or demerits.
The Bon. the SPEAKER: Then leave
consider the report now is not granted?

to

Hon. Mr. HAIG: No.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: The report stands

moved the thîrd

I-ion. JOHN T. HAIG: I do not. intend to
dei.î', lue house with mure thait une or tîvu
remrarksý. 1 support the bill; and I congratuhale the minister and the officiais of the
deparîrnent ripon biaving brought down this
codification. It is a great improvement on
the Iaw in ils prescrnt forai. W/bat I have in
mind is not, so mucb this or Ibal detail as that
the income tax iaw is now codifled in one
stzite. 50 arranged that ive can very easily
folhow its provisions.
I notice that some of the doubtful provisions
of the law have been drasticaiiy cbanged. I
notice aico that a prominent section of the
press of this country is objecting to certain
provisions in the statute. Ail these provisions
vere fuliy discussed by our commiltee. For
instance, in dealing with the situation which
arises when someone tri-es to evade the payment of income tax, some question was raisod
as to whother the matter should be decided by
an Aýppeai Court or b-, the Treasury Board.
1 arn one of those -who h(lirve that. as it is a
politicai malter, il shcuid he decidcd hy the
Treasur.v Board. 1 lhir.k the govcî ornent should
take foul responsibiiity for it. For over two
hours iast nighit the Senate committee discuisscd the new amendýments and ýparticularly
those that were reforred to yesterday by the
honourabie senator from Toronito (Mon. Mr.

Hayden). The Minister of Finance adopted a
fair attitudie and did a fine job of expiaining
the arncndmcnts. le did ot make many
concessions, but those he did make were worth
while. Further, the Minister of Finance
adviscd us Ibat thiere wiil be an opportunity
to change the provisions of this bill if, before
the 'bill is put mbt cifect on January 1, 1949,
thcy are found to be improper and irroguiar.
Again titis mnorning, the commitîce sat for
two and a liaif hours and gave further study
ho the arnencirnents. I lho-ugh.t the honourabie
senator from Inkerman (Hon. Mr. lluges,eo)
made a pretty fair speech wben be explainod
the bill, but when we got int committce 1
found that there w.ere rnany things hoe did not
understand and ivbich hiad 10 be clarifled by
the officiais. I feit quile happy about that.
1-onourahie wenators, Ibis is lthe inost importartI igislilîion wbich wr have lad to deai
wilh titis .session. A very beavy tax bas been
iiiiposed on praclicaily evoryhody in Canada;
ti.erefore lthe mnalter bas 10 receive the most
careful consîderalion. I heartly support the
in(,a
:î,.
I feci that some of the provisions
will not work out -as the officiais expeet tbem
bo (10 but if lthe minid--er bas roflected tbe reai
aittitutde of hjs officiais and 1 think he bastli,ere shouhd ho no trouble in carrying out the
intentions of lthe bill.
The motion -,as agreed b., and the bill was
rcad lthe third lime, and passed.
BUSINESS 0F THE SDNý'ATE
GOVEIINMENT L.EGISLATION

On tbe Orders of the Day:
Hon. WISHART
MeL. ROBE.RTSO'N:
Honourable senators, for the information of
Ihe bouse 1 sbouid like to give some indicalin of our sittings in the immediale fu;ture.
W'ile Ibere can ho no certain4ty about il, I
uiidersland that there is a very gond chance
ltat lthe business of parliament will have been
compiled in lime for prorogation tomorrow
evening. Therefore, wvhen the Sonate adjouros
loday. I intend 10 move thal il stand adjourned
uintil lornnrrow aflernoon aI 3 o'ciock, in order
LlimaI we may expedite consideralion of witever measures, corne beýfore us.
I sltould iike to lake advantage of Ibis
opportunity 10 draw attention 10 some informnation whicb 1 tbink gives a clear and conx'încing picture of the increasing share of the
Sonate in the legisialive work of parliament.
More govcrniment business bas been handled
by lthe Senate titis session Ihaýn in any other
scssion during the iast forty years. Furtbermore, for the first lime in our bistory a cabinet
minister from the Huse of Commons appeared

JUNE 25, 1948
in the Senate to explain a government bill
initiated in this bouse.
A careful search of aur records indicates thýat
the number of government bis initiated in
the Senate this session-twenty-four-bas heen
urequalled in any session since at least 1908,
wben the numaber was thirteen; and that until
1947, when the figure rose to fifteen, the number of government measures initiated bere in
one session bas never exceeded. eight. During
the war years, from 1940 to 1944-45, government measures were without exception brought
d<own first in 'the. flouse of Commons, but in
the three years since the end of ýthe war the
number of government measures introduced
in tbe Senate bas steadily increased.
A further indication of the increased, legislative activity of the Senate is to be found
in the numTber of éther hbis bandled. For
instance, this session fourteen private bis
were initiated here. Then, as we ail know,
our Divorce ýCommittee bas been very active:
it brought in favourabie reports on -two
hundred and ninety-five petitions, for each
of which a bill was passed. Besides aiýl this,
the Senate has deait with a hundred-odd
measures that originated in the flouse of
Commons.
I bave drawn attention to these figures
hecause 'I feit that the bouse and the country
as a whole wou'ld bho in'terosted in them. The
Sonate is prepared and indeed eager, as it
will continue to -be in the years to corne, té
participate to the utmost of i-ts ability in the
legisiative business of Canada.

Hon. CAIRI1NE R. WILSON moved concurrence in the report.
She said: H-onourable senators, I bad hoped
that. before I asked for consideration of the
comnittee's
recommendations
honourable
members would have bad an opportunity of
reading them. However, I trust that the
report will be carefully studied as soon as
possible.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: May 1 suggest that the
honourable senator read the report now? It
is really wortb wbile.
Hon. 'Mrs. WILSON: The report appears
in today's Minutes as wel1 as in Hansard;
but if honourable memibers so desire, I shall
read it.

669

Hon. Mr. HAIG: Perhaps that will flot be
necessary.
Hon. Mrs. WILSON: It will be noted, from
the report that d.uring the last twelve months
the Imsmigration Branch has greatly expanded
its activities. The govornment bas agreed té
admit 30,000 persons from the displaced persons camps of Europe. This is an ovidence
of a desire to fuilfil our otbligations as a ýmember of the International Refugee Organization,
and indicates a more generous attitude on 'Uhe
part of our own people. In addition, 25,000
a,pplications of near relatives have been
appro1ved. To date on-ly some 8,000 persons
in this class bave arrived bore, but the others
will lie brought, over as soon as possible. The
Beaverbrae, a converted German prize slip,
is being used for this special work and will
bring to our shores about 770 near relatives
every thirty-seven days.
The committee foît that a careful study of
the deportation regul-ations should be undertaken by the departmnents concerned. People
who are admitted to Canada after having
successfully passed the bealth tests may
suifer a temjporary nervous or mental disorder requiring treatment in a mental ingtitution. iAfter being restorod to normal bealili
tbey may be permitted by the minister to
romain in Canada, but they neyer can become
Canadian citizens. This must inevitably bave
an eifect upun their murale, and I fear that
somotimos it causes a recurrence of the original malady.
The committee was very favourably impressod by the presentations from members
and Canadian representatives of various
Chines-e organizations. These peo>ple -&me to
urge that PjC. 2116 bie repealed, so. as to
permit Chinese resident in Canada to iyring
their wives and families here. I tbink the
committee felt that the Act was oontrary
to our bumanitarian and social obligations,
and inconsistent cwith the Prime Minister's
statement in anothor place that there sbould
bce no discrimination against tbe Chinose.
Tbrough the efforts of the honourable sonator from Letbbridge (Hon. Mr. Buchanan) a
brief, prepared by an Estonian on behaîf of
a large number of bis countrymen now in
Sweden, was presented to the committee. It
was read by the honourable senator frora
Churcbill (Hon. Mr. Crerar). It was said that
these people are not under the protection of
the International Refugee Organization, and
althougli at present they are perhaps fairly
comfortable, tbey live in constant fear -of
.being returned to tbeir country of origin. We
are convincod that they would make most

SENATE

desirable Canadian citizens, and we are gratified by the desire on the part of the Immigration Branch to consider them. A team has
already been established in Sweden to investigate and decide upon the admission to Canada
of at least some of them.
Your committee advocates that more consideration be given ta adults, now in D.P.
camps, who have intellectual skills, and to the
admission of workers and their dependents.
Up to the present time the practice has been
to bring out single men and women, leaving
the older people who are dependent upon
them for support to endure the hardships of
the existence in camp, where they continue
to be an obligation on the part of the International Refugee Organization. The committee recommends that a more generous contribution be made towards this organization
so as ta insure the resettlement of these
people. They have been languishing in the
camps for three years since the conclusion of
the war, and their morale is bound to deteriorate.
With the permission of the house I should
like to read the foreword by General Crerar
to the report of the National Conference on
the citizenship problems of the new immigrants. I had the privilege of attending this
conference, held in Montreal on January 23
and 24 last. This is the foreword:
The Canadian Citizenship Council exists to
assist Canadians, and Canadians-to-be, in reaching a better understanding and appreciation of
the meaning and implications of democracy.
The conference reported in this volume centred
its interest on the Canadians-to-be, the newcomers who in the tourse of five or more years
w-ill assume the foul privileges and responsibilitics of citizenship in Canada.
wvas very
Attendance at the conference
broadly rcpresentative, indicating wide -and deep
interest in the matters under discussion. The
recommendations have behind them the expericure cf persons familiar with the problens of
immigrants from many angles; they are dircted
to many organizations, voluntary as well as governmental.
The Executive Committee of the Canadian
Citizenship Council is giving careful study to
those recommendations directed to the council.
and hopes that every organization concerned
will do similarly, even where major changes in
policy or program are proposed. Assisting the
newcomers to become good Canadians, with a
feeling of pride and responsibility for their
new homeland, is a task worthy of our best
effort, a task moreover than ean yield satisfactions and benefits to all who talke part in it.
H. D. G. Crerar,
Chairman, Executive Committee
Canadian Citizenship Council.
The committee felt that there should be
closer co-ordination between the departments
of the government concerned with the problems of immigrants and their proper assimila-

tion here. For this reason we recommend the
setting up of a co-ordinating committee consisting of representatives from the Immigration Branch, Department of Labour, the
Department of External Affairs, National
Health and Welfare, and the Citizenship Branch
of the Department of the Secretary of State.
This latter branch, which is primarily concerned with the education of newcomers, has
had various pamphlets printed which should
be of interest and value to them.
I have before me a booklet entitled How
to Become a Canadian Citizen, printed in
both English and French. The senator from
Churchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar) asked if this book
was printed in the languages of the people
who would use it. I am pleased to report
that the second part of it, dealing with facts
about Canada, is printed in seven European
languages. The first part, which deals with
naturalization and concerns the immigrant
when he is about to take the oath of citizenship, is printed in the two official languages
of Canada. There is, however, a great need
for more literature to help the immigrants.
The committee recommends a closer relationship between the departments of government having to do with immigration and the
voluntary agencies throughout the country
which are anxious to welcome and assist the
newcomers. It is felt that more information
about Canada should be given, and that
training in basic English or French should be
undertaken before the immigrant arrives. To
acconplish this. suitable literature and films
now available should be distributed in Europe
and on board ships; and, as the occasion permis, language instruction should be given.
These aids to citizenship should be prepared
at thrce levels: first. elementary; second, for
use after certain adjustments have been made
to Canadian life; and third, advanced, for the
use of better-educated people from the United
Kingdom and the United States, who make
up more than half of the immigrant popuSome excellent booklets on basic
lation.
English prepared in the United States should
be re-written, using Canadian references and
illustrations.
Honourable senators should know that the
Canadian Citizenship Council stands ready to
act as a liaison between governmental departments and the many social agencies in
Canada. Some of these agencies are the
Canadian Welfare Council, the Canadian
Educational Association, Canadian Association for Adult Education and the Canadian
Recreational Council. The result of such a
liaison would further co-ordinate all formal
instruction under provincial departments for

JUNE 25, 1948
citizenship with that of private welfare organizations. The Canadian Citizenship Council
operates in conjunction with the national
organizations and does flot take over the
functions of the goverfiment, in either the
Dominion or provincial field.
The report suggests that a small group of
people, speaking the languages of the newcorners, should visit themn in an endeavour
to understand their problems and put themn in
touch with the varjous agencies which can
help them. The honourable senator from
Churchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar) was nervous lest
.ve should appoint a large body of-ion. Mr. HAIG: Inspectors.
Hon. Mrs. WILSON: -government officials,
but we assured hima that that was not our
idea, and that the appointments should be on
a temporary basis. I feel that such a staff is
an absolute necessity, for, as the honourable
senator from Blaine Lake (Hon. Mr. lamner)
bas, said, if we do not undertake this work
there are, unfortunately, other people who will
do it for us.
Hon. WISHART McL. ROBE RTSON: It
is not my intention to detain the Senate with
a discussion of details of the report, but I
should like to express on my own behaif and,
I believe, on behaif of other members of the
Senate, keen appreciation of the great contribution this committee has made, through
inquiries carried on from year to year in connection with the subject of immigration, ta the
work of the Senate and the fund of knowledge
available ta Canadians generally. It will be
recalled that the work was initiated under the
chairmanship of the honourable senator fromn

671

Parkdale (Hon. Mr. Murdock), and that the
bonourable senator fromn Toronto-Trinity
(Hon. Mr. Roebuck) has taken an outstanding
part in its activities. The committee bas rendered a great public service, and I believe
the influence of its deliberations and its reports
is widespread. I know that many persons who
are interested in these matters have obtained
copies of the committee's proceedings and
studied them. A willingness not to weary in
well-doing but to carry on froma year ta year,
and the number of sittings that have been held,
evidence a very considerable activity.
More recently the work of the committee
bas been carried on under the chairmanship
of the honourable senator fromn Rockcliffe
(Hon. Mrs. Wilson), who has had a lifelong
interest in these mattera, and under whose
leadership the rousing, educating and influencing of public opinion, which characterized the initial stages of the work, has most
effectively continued. We have before us an
outstanding example of the gathering together
of information from those who are in a position to give evidence and the imparting of that
information ta the public for the benefit and
welfare of ail concerned. For these reasons I
bave taken this opportunity to express on my
own behaif and, I helieve, as a reflection of
the general sentiment of the house, keen
appreciatian of the work which began some
years ago and bas been continued sa efficiently
and so well by the honourable senator from
Rockcliffe.
The motion was agreed to.
The Senate adjourned until tomorrow at
3 p.m.

IIUMAN

RIGHTS AND FUNDAMIENTAL
]FREEDOMS

Report of Joint Committee
The Special Joint Committee on Human
Rights and Fundamental Freedoms beg leave
to make their second and final report, as
follows:
Your committee, as a preliminary step in its
enquiry resolved a portion of jts order of
reference of February 18, 1948, into three
parts, namely:
(a) To consider the question of human
rights and fundamental freedoms, and the
maniner' in which those obligations acceptcd by ail members of the United Nations
iiîay best be iînpleinented;
And, in partieular, in the ligbt of the provisions contained in the Charter of the
United Nations, and the establishment by
the Economie and Social Couneil thercof
of a Commission on Hluman Rigbts.
(b) What is the legal and constitutional
situation in Canada with respect to such
rigblts;
(c) And, wbat steps, if any, it would be
advisable to take or to recommend for
the purpose of preserving in Canada
respect for the observance of human rights
and fundamental freedoms;
for consideration in the order (a), (c) and (b).
With respect to part (a), your committee
gave immediate consideration to the draft
International Declaration on Human Rights
forwarded to the government by the Secretary-General of United Nations.
Although not legally binding upon states,
such a document, being a statement of principles, will tend to influence the course of
legislation in states whicb consider tbemselves
morally bound by its provisions, and will,
therefore, promote human rigbts and fundamental freedoms.
As the draft declaration has been undergoing
changes at recent meetings of organs of the
United Nations, your committee decided that
it should not attempt to prepare a furtber
draft but should examine critically the principles set out in the existîng draft together
with such comments of other governments as
were available.
Your committee considers that the declaratien would be more effective if stated in a
shorter, more concise form. As there is no
assurance that any specifie draft prepared by
your committee would be accepted by the
United Nations, your committee does not
suggest any particular revision of the draft
submitted but recommends that the govern-

ment, in presenting its views to the United
Nations, have in mmnd the views of members
ni your committee as reported ini the record
of proceedings and evidence.
With respect to part (c), your committee
invitcd written representations fromn groups
and organizations whicb had expressed a desire
to place their views before your committee.
Written submissions wore made by:
(a) Canadian Jewisli Congress;
(b) Congregations of Jehova's, Witnesses;
(c) Civil Riglits Union of Toronto;
(d) Canadian Daily Newspapers Association;
(e) Organizations representing the Chinese
people of Canada;
(f) Committee for a Bill ni Rights, Toronto.
As -a result of these representations your
committee gave consideration to the ennetment of a bill ni rigbýts for Canada.
Althoughi aIl the briefs submitted did ot
recommend a bill of rights for ýCanada, those
whicb contained such recommendation favoured the enactmnent of a bill of rights by
constitutional amendment rather than *by -a
fedkeral st-atute.
At the request of the committee, the Deputy
Minister of Justice *was heard in relation to
the effeet ni the enactment of a bill of rights
as (1) a iodýerai statute; (2) a constitutional
amendmient; and, in particular, to its effeet on
existing, and
prospective
provincial
and
dominion legislation, the common law, the
sovereignty ni parliament, and the prerogatives
of the Crown.
Your committee is of opinion that to
attempt to enact n bill ni rigbts for Canada as
a federal statute would be unwise for the
iollowing among other reasons.
The pow~er of the Dominion Parliament to
enact a comprehensive bill of rights is disputed. This is indica-ted by the letters received
in reply to an invitation addressed by the
committee to the ýattoracys-general ni the
provinces and to dýeans of certain law sehools
to express their opinions witb respect to the
power of parliament .to enact a comprebensive
bill ni rights applicable to aIl ni Canada.
Clarification oi the extent of the Dominion 's
powers by reference of questions to the
Supreme Court ni Canada bas been suggested,
but these questions. in addition to, presenting
serious drafting dffficulties, would certainly
initiate a legal and constitutional controversy with the provinces which might 'be far
reaching.
De.spite this fact, the submission of sucb
questions migbt be desirable if the answers

JUNE 25, 194
could be taken as settling the law, -and if a
federal statute based on such answers effected
a constitutional guarantee of human rights and
fundamental freedoms. The fact is, however,
that the answers would flot be the equivalent
ini binding effect of a decision in a litigated
case arising on particular facts. Moreover, a
federal statute enacted on the basis of answers
to such questions would flot effect any constitutional guarantee of righits as ît could be
amended or repealed at any time by parliament. Until amended or repealed it would
bind the provincial législatures (to the extent
that it was constitutiona.lly valid) but flot the
Dominion Parliament, as subséquient legisialion of the Dominion Parliament inconsistent
with its terms could take effeet n.otwithstanding its terms.
Lt is perhaps for these reasons that the submissions to your committee in support of a
bill of rights favour a constitutional amendment rather than a federal statute. Your
committee is. therefore, unable to recommend
that the government give favourable consideration to the enactment of a bill of rights in the
formn of a federal statuts.
In view of the fact that decisions by the
Supreme Court of Canada in individual cases
would be far more satisfactory than upon. a
genéral reference in determining the powers of
parliament and the legislatures, your cornmnittee gave some considération to the question as to whether the jurisdiction of the
Supreme Court of Canada should flot be
ecnl.argcd, so that by leave of that -court, appeals
w'votld lie on questions of law in some instances
in 'which there is now no appeal. You-r coinmittee is of opinion that the government
should give consideration to such an enlargement and so recommends.
Due to pressure of time it was impossible for
your committee to caîl those who made submissions to your committee to, support thema
orally. It is possible that had those who
submitted the draft bill to amend the British
North America Act heen présent they couid
have answered some or ail of the numerous
questions which have arisen in the minds of
members of your committee regarding the
consequences of incorporating the provisions of
this draft bill in the British North America Act.
.From the evidence of the Deputy Minister
of Justice, however, it would appear that these
consequences are so uncertain and may, in
some instances at least, be so undesirable, that
3'our committee would not be justified in
reýcomiaending, without a great deal of further
study. the adoption of recommendations such
as those contained in the submaission. of the
colnmittee.for a Bill of Rights, Toronto.
Your committee recommends that in considering proposals for the enactmnent of a bill

of rights as a constitutional amendment the
government not only give full considération
to the submissions to the committee, the evidence of the Deputy Minister of Justice and the
comments of the members of the committee, as
they appear fromn the record of the proceedings,
but also obtain the assistance of officers of the
Department of Justice or an interdepartmental
committee, and such others as it may consider
necessary.
In making this report your committee wishes
to state its belief that Canadians enjoy a large
measure of civil rights and liberties. That they
must be maintained is beyond question. But
to attempt to define these rights and liberties
in statutory language is a task not to be undertaken lightly. The difficulty of such a task is
shown by the struggles for agreement on the
wording of an international bill of rights which
have heen occupying the time of the United
Nations for so long. However, the meaning of
human rights and fundamental frccd.oms is in
général well understood.
They ex[st, are
cnjoyed and must be preserved.
Attention may he drawn to circumstances in
which fundamental rights are alleged to have
been curtailed. It is désirable that such circumatances be examined critically and earnestly
for they prompt the goverfiment and parliament of the day to take stock of the extent to
which Canada lias maintained civil rights and
liberties for bier people. If imperfections appear, are recognized and are remedied, progress
as made towards full realization of the ideal of
genéral observance of human rights and fundamental freedomis for ail envisagýed in the
charter of the united nations.
Respect for and observance of these rights
and freedoms depends in the last analysis upon
the convictions, character and spirit of the
people. There is much to he said for the view
that it would be undesirable to undertake to
define them. hefore a firmn public opinion has
been formed as to thieir nature. Lt is not
evident to your committee that such an opinion
lias reached an advaneed stage in Canada.
There is need for more public discussion before
the task of defining the rights and freedoms
to be safeguarded is undertaken.
But whatever steps he advocated by way of
statutory enactmnent or otherwise to preserve
human rights and fundamental freedoms,
Canadians must neyer fail to recognize that
the ultimate and effective safeguard of those
rights and freedoms lies in the people themselves, and in a resolute and effective public
opinion.
A eopy of the prînted Minutes of Proceedings
and Evidence of your corniittee is appended.
Al! of whîch is respectfully submitted.

The Senate met at 3 p.m., the Speaker in the
Chair.
Prayers and routine proceedings.
BUSINESS OF THE SENATE
Hon. WISHART MeL. ROBERTSON:
Honourable senators, before we proceed with
the Orders of the day, I think I should say
for the information of honourable members
that the business of the other house has not
proceeded far enough to enable me to state
definitely whether prorogation will take place
tonight or not. I would therefore suggest that
when the items on the Order Paper have been
disposed of this afternoon, we adjourn during
pleasure, to reassemble at eight o'clock. At
that time I hope to be in a po-ition to advise
the house whether we can conclude our labours
this evening or will have to corne back on
Monday at three o'clock in order to do so.
FOREIGN EXCHANGE CONTROL BILL
F1IRST

READING

A message was received from the House of
Commons with Bill 396, an Act to amend The
Foreign Exchange Control Act
The bill was read the first time.
SECOND

READING

Hon.
WISHART
MeL.
ROBERTSON
moved the second reading of the bill.
He said: Honourable senators, the purpose
of this bill is to close a loophole which has
been found to exist in the Foreign Exchange
Control Act. When the Act was originally
drafted, it was intended that its provisions
should affect transactions by Canadian residents whether in Canada or outside. The
words "in Canada or elsewhere" appeared in
most clauses, but through an oversight were
omitted from sections 21, 22, and 23. In a
recent case in Toronto, in which a Canadian
resident was charged with failing to sell to
the board some $15,000 in United States funds
which he had in his possession, the magistrate
held that the man was not guilty because the
transaction took place in Niagara Falls, New
York, and the relevant sections of the Act
applied only to transactions in Canada.
It is absolutely essential that the transactions
of Canadian residents be controlled, wherever
they take place; therefore the government is
asking for this amendment to bring the wording of the Act into line with the needs of our
exchange conservation program. The amend-

ment simply inserts the phrase "in Canada or
elsewhere" in the three sections from which it
was omitted.
Hon. W. M. ASELTINE: I have read the
bill very carefully, and may say that we on
this side of the house have no objection to the
amendments.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the second time.
THIRD

READING

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON moved the third
reading of the bill.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the third time, and passed.
EMERGENCY EXCHANGE CONSERVATION BILL
FIRST

READING

A message was received from the House of
Commons with Bill 397, an Act to amend The
Emergency Exchange Conservation Act.
The bill was rend the first time.
SECOND

READING

Hon.
WISHART
MeL.
ROBERTSON
movcd the second reading of the bill.
He said: Honourable senators, the purpose
of this bill is to imakec a number of miner
changes in the Emergcncy Exchange Conservation Act which was passed earlier this
session. An examination of the bill will reveal
that the changes consist partly of clarifications
of the existing wording, and partly of the
insertion of a few tariff items in the schedules
where it appears possible to make a further saving of United States dollars.
It will be noted that goods added to the
list of prohibited or restricted imports do not
differ in character from those which it already
includes. In view of the extent and complexity of the conservation program, it is
inevîtable that changes in 'the schedules will
be found necessary fron time to time to
improve the working of the import restrictions and correct anomalies of one kind or
ano.ther.
In the other place the ministers responsible
for the exchange conservation progran outlined the progress made to date in improving
our United States dollar position. I do not
intend to repeat their observations, except
to point out that our Uni.ted Sta:tes dollar
reserve as of June 23, stood at $742 million,
including $140 million drawn from the ExportImport Bank. if we do not count these drawings, we may say that our dollar reserve
increased from $461 million on December 17,
1947, to $602 million on June 23, 1948. It

675

JUNE 26, 1948
is apparent that our exehange position is
being gradually but ateadiIy improved; that
aur imports froan dollar countries are reduced
semewhat, and our emiports to dollar countries
are substantially increased. This is being
achieved without any seriaus hiardship to the
non-dollar countries wjth whorn we trade.
Control od capital goods irnported is also
beginning to show excellent resuits. Consequently the -minister has 'been able ta announce certain prospective relaxations in
restrictions.
Referring again to the amendments contained in this 'bill, honourable senators willnote that section 1 makes seven changes in
the schedule of prohibited importe. Four of
these are additions or extensions to the
present list of prohibi.ted goods, iwhile the
other three merely clarify existing wording.
Section 2 of the bill inerely transfers th-ree
items from the list of goods controlled by
permit ta the list of goods under quota.
Hon. Mr. MORAUD: May I ask -the haonourable leader if the items in schedule II are
on the prohibited list? 1 see the words:
"439 Bicycles and tricycles, n.ýo.p." Do I
understand that there is -an embargo on these
goods?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: 1 ithink they are
changed.
Hon. Mr. MORAUD: Wha't does the change
from schedule 1ii1 to sched-ule Il -mean?
Hlon. Mr. -ROBERTSON: It is a change
from the list of goods controlled by permit
to the list of goode under quota.
Hon. Mr. MOR.AUD: Do I understand that
bicycles and tricycles can now be imported
from the United States?

Hon. Mr. ROBERT8ON: Yes, under permit; but they are to corne under the quota
classification.

-Han. Mr. R(YEBUOK:

Do 1 understand

that -the gain in aur balance

af Almerican

dollars is greater or less 'than Vhe amount
of the loan?
-Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: It is greater than
the amount of the boan. For the benefit
of may honourable friend I will repeat the
figures I just gave. On June 23, 1948, the
total reserve was $742 million, which included
$140 million of the draiwings on the ExportImport Bank bean. The, actual increase in
American dollars is the difference between

$Ml million and $602 million, although at
the moment the reserve exceeds that by the
$1-40 million -which was drawn fromn the
Export-Iiuport Bank

Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: Thank you.

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Section 3 of the
bill, containing a formidable liet of gaods,
is not as important as it may appear at first
sight. Most oif tjhe changes are rearrangements of words to conform wiïtb changed
terminology ini the customs tariff. There are
a few ather changes designed ta ianprove (the
administration. The only significant additions ita the schedule od goods under the control of the Minister of Trade and Commerce

are heavy chemicals and electrical appliance
parts.
The bill is deemed to have came into force
on the 25th of Jun this year.
Theinotion wvas agreed ta, and the bill mas
read the second time.

Hon. Mi-. ASELTINE: 1 was flot present
when the Pris ate Bis Committce of the otheî'
house considered these petitions. In the St.
Martin case the evidence heard before the
Divorce Committee was very strong against
the respondent, and at the close of the case for
the petitioner, counsel for the respondent asked
for a haif-hour adjourniment in order to deride
whether or flot es idence shou!ld be cal!ed for
the defence. The ceîmjîttee ailowed an adjourriment of three heurs, and when the hearing was resumed, counsel for the respondent, in
the presenre of the respondent, advised the
committee that he wou!d cal! no defence.
Acrording!y, a hill for divorce was recoinmended.
I understand that at a later date the respondent claimcd that hier counsel had flot handlcd

HUMAN RIGHTS A'ND FUNDAMENTAL
F'REEDOMS
REPORT 0F JOINT COMMITTEE

The Sen'ate proceeded ta consideration of
the second and final report of the Special
Joint Comrnittee on Human Rigbts and
Fundamental Freedoins.
Han. L. M. GOUIN moved concurrence
in the report.
H1e said: Honourable senators, first of aIl,
in the capacity of Joint Chairman of tbe
Special Joint Comm'ittee on Human Rigbts and
Fundamental Freedoins, I wish ta thank yau
very sincerely for baving appoi'nted me as
your representative on that committee. As you
wiil re-member, the committee was re-constituted this epring be-cause during the previaus
session we btad 'been a.ble ta do only sanie
preiiminary work. In 1947 we mereiy expiared this almost uniimited subject, and the
onýly materiai whicb was be-fore us was the
charter of the United Nations and the documents referring ta the organization of its
Comisio~in on Human Rigbts. This ycar
aur task was mach maore defite; we were
cailed upon ta stady the report su'bmitted
by the United Nations'Commission on Haman
Ri'ghts ta the Economie and Social Coancil
of the United Nations. This repart was
a'dopted at Geneva on De-ceusher 17 of last
year, at the end of the second session of
tbat commission.
The two most, important documents whicb
forin part of or are annexed to tbe report
consist of, first, a draft international deciaration on buman rigbts, and second, a draft international covenant on the samne subi oct.
This afternoon, 'while expiaining the reiport
whicb is now before tbis bouse, I shahl confine
My remarks ta the draft international declaratian. Tbe 'International Draft Bihl of Rights
bas be-en referred ta the General Asse-mbly,
but for variaus reasons it bas not yet been
considered by aur committee, and it is flot
even mentioned in tbe report, wbich is tû ho
found in aur Minutes af Proceedings of
yesterday, st page 512 and following. I give
this re-ference because, by referring to the
text of aur rather long and elaborate report,
it will 'be casier for tbose senators wbo 'were
not members of aur cammittee ta follow my
remarks.

677

-As honauraible senators will rememiber, by'
the ternis of our order of reference of April
16 last we were cailed upon "ta consider thequestion of huiman rights and fundamental
freedonis, and the manner in which those obligations accepted by al! mrnbers of the United
Nations may best be implemented". Youx
already know that the charter of the United
Nations organization refers in several places.
ta hu-man rights and fundamental freedoms,
but nowhere in the charter of the United
Nations and, le-t me ad'd, nowhere in the
report of the Uni-ted Nations -Commission on
Human Rigb-ts, nor in fact anywhere else
in the documents received cither froin Geneva
or froin Lake Success, do we find any definition of the expression "human rights and
fundainentai freedoms." This absence of any
definition or any interpretative section bias in
my opinion made aur work much more diiicuit. In -accordance witb the ancient systern
of aur scholastic phiiosaphy, we aliways begin
with what we call a de.finitio terminorum.Suoh a de-finition of ýterms is considered by us
to be essential. Otherwise, those who arguedo not use -the contested words in the saine
sense, and consequentiy do not speakthe same
language: accordingiy the resait of the discussion can neyer be very sa-tisfýactory, and
wiil probabiy be disappainting.
'I must confess that tbroughou't -the manylong sittings whicb *wc bad in aur commit-tee
room this year, *as weii as last, year, I always
feit handicapped and ernbarrassed by ýthe iack
of any definition and by the 'fatal vag.uenessand amibiguity which was its sequel. Sa be-fore
proceeding any further, let. us try ta discover-ome general iandrnark- wbicb wiil belp us ta
not lose auir way in this iabyrintb af ciaborate
texts and 'contradietory comments.
1 would remark first of ail that the expression
"buman rigbts" seems very ('learly ta be a
translation of the words "droits de l'homme"
or "rig-hts of the individual", and tbat it wasborrowed froin tbe language of the French
Revolution. I do flot intend to make any
criti.eizm af tbe French Revolution, because 1
accept it as a great bistorical fact. In a cértain
sense it was a necessary evii, with a record of
many errors and crimes, but an the other band.
it ieft ta mankind at large the immortal slogan,
"Liberté, Egalité et Fraternité", which is now
accepted in ahl democratic cauntries. This:
tbree-fold principie of freedoin, equaiity and
brotherhaod is weii understood, and constitutes
a giariaus beritage wbich aIl Canadians are
anxious ta preserve aud develop, and to shagre
witb their brothers and sisters of aIl races and
colours, and of aIl reiigious and social creeds.
We came now ta tbe expression "fundamental
freedoins", wbich I have aiways as-umed to,

W8

SENATE

have reference to the four freedoms of the toomuch-forgotten Atlantic Charter: freedom
of conscience, freedom of expression, freedoma
from want, and freedom from fear. As hionourable senators wiIl see by my further expianatien, the revjsed draft declaration, which lias
now been referred te the General Assembly of
the United Nations, expressly recognizes the
basic principle of personal liberty, national
equality, and respect for the rights of on1e
another. It also afllrms the principles of freedom of conscience and expression, as well as
the right to social security.
Let us examine the attitude of our special
joint committee towards the draft International
Deciaration on Human Rights. In paragraph
3 of our report it is expiained that an International Declaration on Human Rights shall
not be "iegally binding upon states, such a
document beingý a statrment of principles". But
we add that sucli a (leciaration "wiil tend te,
influence the course of legisiation in states
which consider themselves moraily bound by
its provisions, and wvili therefore premote
human righits and fundamental fîcedoms". In
other words there would be a certain persuasive
influence.
The joint committee carefully analysed tue
principles set eut in the draft International
Declaration adopted in Geneva on Decemher
17, 1917, and came to the lînanimeus conclusion
that the draft wouid be mure effectiv e if set out
in more concise form. In fact. on June 18,
1948, at Lake Success, the International Comission on Huinan Righits adopted a rcvised
draft, which was reprodueed in the Amerîcan
press. It is certainiy an improvement over the
prev ions draft, being murh clearer and shorter,
comprising only twenty-eight articles in place
of thirty-three or more. Manv of the sections
theomselves have heen considerably short ened.
The te-xt in question is se, important that, with
the leav e of the Senate, I would suggest thiat it
be reproduced in Hansrrd; o:herwise honourable senators who were flot members of our
conimittee weuld have great difficuitv in
follom-ing the report nue befure us.
(.Scý Appendir at end of teday's report.)
The first part of the declaration deais w'ith
civil riglits: righit to life. liberty and security;
freedom fi-on, siavory or cruel or inhum:în
treatment; freedom from unreasonabie interference with privacy, in the family, the home,
correspofidefice or reputation; liberty of mevement and free choice of re-ýidence within .;tates,
and the right te leave any country, including
Cne's own,
There are aise prov isions purporting te
secure. in civil and criminal cases, access to
independrnt and impartial tribunals, freedom
from arbitrarv arrest or detentior' and free-

dom from ex post facto ]aws. Other articles
guarantee the right ef preperty, freedom of
religion, freedoma of information, assembly and
association, and assure the right te participate
in gevernment.
Article 20 and fellewing are devoted te
econoînie and social rights: the right te work,
inc]uding the right te equal pay fer equal
work; the right te preservatien of health
threugh highest standards ef feod, clothing,
housing and medical care; the right te educatien and te, rest and leisure.
Article 27 states that: "Everyone has duties
te thie cemmunity". It further states that the
rights of everyone are limitued by "thE riglits
of otliers and the requirements of morality,
public order and general weifare in a democratie seciety".
Finaliy, article 28 expiessiy denies the right
of any state er person te engage in any nctivity
aîîned at the destruction of an of the righits
and freedori- prescribed i11 the International
Deciaration on Human Rights.
Te -:umi p, this declaration-as stated in
the first paragiaph of the revised text-affirma
thiat "the recognition ef the ifiherent dignity
and of the equal and inalienable righits of aIl
inembers of the human family is the foundatien of freedom, justice and peace in the
w ori*d". I readily admit that that is a very
noble statement. and one whiceh is inspired by
a generous ideal, but 1 regret that the deelaratien nowhiere states that we derix e ail oui rights
from God, whe is our Creator as w~eil as our
end.
On this peint I wish te refer honourabie
senators te page 52 and following pages of our
commnittee's Mlinutes of Proceedings, Volume
No. 3, 1948. Thiere will be feund some very
ifiteres.ting remnarks made at our meeting of
May 13 by two of the committee's members
froni the other bouse, nainely, Mr. Marquis
an(l Mr. Michaud. Mr. Marquis quoted the
Deciai ation of Independence adopted by the
United States congress on Jnly 4, 1776, which
refers te G od and te the Creator and aise
invoke,' tîe p)retection of Divine Providence.
I sinocrely believe in the fatherhood of God,
aud in this I simply share the faith of the
immense majerity of people of this country
and of the world at large. Therefore, 1 heartily
concurred in the suggestion made by Mr.
Mai quis. seconded by Mr. Michîaud, that at
the begiuîning of the declaration there be introduced a reference te Cod as being the source
of ail human rights.
It m-ili be seen, however, by reference te,
paragrapb 5 of our report, on page 513, that the
committce dîd not suggest sucb a revision or
anv other particular revisien ef the draft

JUNE 26, 1948
International Declaratien cf December 17,
1947. We simply recommended "that the
government, in presenting its views te the
United Nations, bave in mind the views of
mambers of the committee as reported in the
record ef proceedings and evidence". This
attitude was adopted because we had ne assurance that any specifie draft prepared by the
committee would bc accepted by the United
Nations.
The next point I wish te mention is that our
commibtae, in accordance with the terms of
reference, studied "what steps, if any, it would
be advîs,%ble -te take or -te recommend for the
purpose of preserving in Canad-a respect for
the observance of human rights and fundamental freedoma." We examined written gubmissiens received from various organizations
and we gave consideration to the question af
the enaotment cf a bill of rights for Canada.
Let me remark here that the briefs which
racommended a bill of rights favoured jts
enactmaent by constitutional amandment rather
than by federal statute. On these itbwo points
we had the priviliege of hearing the very
illumina.ting evidence given iby the Deputy
Minister of Justice. Owing te pressure of
tiýme, as we were very close to the end of ithe
session, it was impossible fer us te hear any
witnesses in support of the varieus briefs te
which 1 have referred.
W/e finally came te the conclusion that any
attempt taeanact a bill of rights fer Canada
as a federal statute wauld ha unwiise, for
varions reasons which I shaîl try te sumamarize.
First of ahl, the power of the Parliament
of Canada to enact a comprehensive bill of
ri-ghts is disputed. Letters received in answer
to an invitation addressed ta the provincial
Attorneys-General and aise te the deans of
certain law sehools, clearly indica'ted that the
validity of a federal bill of rights would be
contested. Then we axamined the possibîlity
of clarifying this issue by means of a judicial
reiference ta the Supreme Court of 'Canada.
However, it seemed te us that the answers te
the, se 'te speak, theoretical questions that
migh.t ha submnitted to tihe court, would net
settle the law and would net be binding.
W/e were aIse cf opinion that "a faderai
statute enaeted on the basis of answers te
such questions would net effect any censtitutional guaran.tee of rights, as it could be
amended. er repealed Mi any tim~e by parliament." Therefore we were "unable te recommend that the govero-ment give favaurable
censideratien te -the enactmnent of a 'bill of
rights in the ferm of a federal etaitute."
On this matter of civil rights, representatiens were made ta the affect that. in erder te

679

deal with specifie grievances a.rising ouit of
alleged breaches of such rights, it would be
advisable ta enlarge the jurisdiction of the
Supreme Court of Canada, se that, by leave of
that court, appeals 'would lie on questions of
law in some instances in which there is now
no appeal. In our report, at page 514, we say:.
"Your committee is of opinion ýthat the
govern.ment should give consideration te such
an enlargement, and so recom'mends." This
is aur only positive and definite recommendation.
But we came te the general conclusion "ithat
Canadians enjey a large measure of ci-vil rights
and liberties" and that it is "bayond question"
that these m*ust ba .maintained. In spite of
ail the difficulties surrounding a specifie definition of human righ'ts and fundamenta;l frecdams, we believa that the terms are in general
well understood. As our report put its, "They
exist. are enjoyed and must ha preserved."
We insist that it is desirabla to examine
,critically and earne.stly any alleged curtailment
ef fundamental rights. We are convineed
th-at respect and observance cf our righ.ts and
freedoms depend in the last analysis uipon a
firm and wel-informed pu'blîc opinion. The
uktimate and effective safeguard cf such rights
and freedoms lies in the people themnselves.
In other words, te quo-te an eld saying, the
price cf liberty is eternal vigilance.
In accordance with our demnocratia principlas,
we require more public discussion before any
further attempt is made ta define in statutery
form human rights and fundamental freedoms.
In order to comply with the will of the
Canadian people we must first make evaryone
more conscious of thc privileges and responsibilitias of citizenship. We must ascartain by
what precisa steps and constructive measures
aur Canadian ideal of frecdom, equality and
brotherhood can best be pre-lerved and developed. The veice cf the majority ef the
Canadian people must ba clearly heard before
we can proceed fîîrther with the question of
human rights and fundamental freadoms.
Hon. ARTHUR W. ROEBUCK: Honourable senators, this is a subjeet in which I am
interestad, and upon which 1 would have spoken
yasterday had net the lark of caurtesy cf the
leader opposite denied me that epportunity. Hewever, I have remained here until
today, at censiderable inconvenience, because
1 feal that there is something in coonectien
with this repart which should be said. 1 consider it an henour te ha appointed te a joint
committee of both bouses of parliament charged
with consideration of the question cf human
rights and fondamental freedoms, but-and I
sav in sorrow-I am keenly disappointed in

SENATE

the report of that committee, which the hionourable senator from, De Salaberry (Hon. Mr.
Gouin) bias just expounded. I criticize nobody
individually; certainly flot the honourable
gentleman who bas just spoken. I aceept such
responsibility for the report as mîay be mine,
as a member of the committee. and I point out
that the noble sentiments expressed in the
draft declaration by the United Nations Commission on Human Rigbts are not to be found
in the report. I believe tbat if tbe most
interesting and eloquent address wbichi w-e have
just beard were substituted in our records for
the flat and uninteresting report of the coinmittee, it would be a vast improvement.
Honourable senators will observe tbat the
report is almost entirely negative. Tbe comnmittee advise!s against a statutory bill of rigbts,
on the ground that tbe power of tbe Dominion
Parliament to enact such a statute is in
dispute; it is opposed to su.bmitting to tbe
Supreme Court of Canada the question of the
extent of the pewers of tbe Dominion Parliament in this regard, the ground being that it
,vould initiate a controversy withi the provinces;
it is agaý,inst incorporating a bill of rigbts in the
British North Ainerica Act as a constitutional
amco(lment, for reasons exprcsscd in evidence
by tbe Deputy Minister of Jus.tice, nameiy,
flint sucb a, canstitutional ameodment would
be of douhtful value, would constitute a surrender of Canadian autonomy. and would cortail or rights and liberties rather tban enlarge
them. These are the main opinions expressed
in tbe report-tbey cannot be called recomniendations-and tbey are entirely negative.
The drafters do suggest that tbe government consider enlarging tbe jurisdiction of tbe
Supreme Court of Canada to include some
questions cf law; but wbat tbese questions
are the report fails te specify, except to say
that tbey are not now suhject te appeal. Tbey
furtber suggcst that parliament take stock cf
the extent te whicb Canada lias maintained
the liberties cf bier people, and if imperfections~ appear they are te be remcdied; but
ne imperfections are noted as a resuit of the
evidence which lias been beard.
And tbat is all!-One is tempted te comment that if tbe government is net more
vigilant in finding imperfections tban the
committee bas been, as indicated by the
report, it will net be mucb troubled witb tbe
finding cf remedies.
Now with these drab, uninspiring and nogative conclusions, I am in general agreement.
A comprebiensive statutery bill of rigbts
enacted by the Dominion Parliament dees
net seem te ho possible, and a censtitotional
amendment is equally impractical.
But do
these practical conclusions witb regard te, pro-

cedure dispose cf tbe wbole matter of civil
rights and fondamental freedems? It weuld
appear that tbe cemmittee spent se, much
time debating tbe pros and cons of statutes
and amendments tbat it overloeked the fact
that tbe order of reference makes ne mention
cf either cf tbese tbings. Wbat the order
directs is a consideratien cf buman rigbts and
fundamental freedoms, and of tbis tbe report
says practically notbing, except that tbey do
exist and sbould be preserved-a platitude
witb wbicb surely ne one would disagree. One
may vainly sean tbis fiat and oninspiring
document froma beginning te end for a single
assertion of buman rigbts, or for any principle
cf freedom, eitber fundamental or otberwise.
The reports says sucb tbings exist and sbould
ho preserved; but wbat tbey are, or bow te
be prescrved, the cemmittee eitber dees net
know or just dees not tell.
Tbe greatest documents cf freedom in tbe
world's bistory bave net taken the formi cf
either statutes or constitutional amendiments.
Wlien Moses came down frem the meuntain and delivered the ton commandments
there wvas ne attempt at legal effect. Tbe
Decalogue was, as tbe namne implies, a declaratien cf moral principles whicb, witb religieus
sanction, all mankind was urged te observe.
It was for lesser men in later ycars te
embcdy the command "Thou shaît net kilI" in
legal language and statutory forim.
The Magna Carta, wrung hy the Barons
at Runnymede from a reluctant King in 1215,
was net a statute; it was an agreement wbich
the king did net even intend te observe; and
yet tbe Magna Carta forms the basis of
Englisb civil liherties.
The American Declaration cf Independence
was net a statute. It was a declaration te
the effeet that all mon are created equal and
endcwed witb certain inalienable rigbtsamong tbein being life, liberty and tbe pursuit of bappiness. The pelitical philosopbers
of the Amierican Revolution bad ne thougbt
cf law-making. and yet from tbat day te this
they bave influenced the tbougbt and actions
of the wbole world in support cf civil rigbts
and fundamental freedoms.
The Bill of Rigbts cf William and Mary
was in statutory f ormi but, otber tban tbe sections dealing witb tbe succession, it was
intended more as a declaration cf rigbts tban
as enforceable law.
Indeed, the cemmittee itself bias inadvertently recognized tbat tbe legal force cf a
statement is net essential te the power cf
truth. In its reference te the draft International Declaration on Human Rigbts by a

JUNE 26, 1948
Committee of the United Nations, the report
usels these words:
.Although flot legally binding upon States,
such a document, being a statement of prin-ciples, will tend to influence the course of legislation in States which consider themselves
morally bound by its provisions, and will,
therefore, promote human rights and fundamental freedoms.
*Had we proceeded to declare great principles,
rather than to content ourselves with legal
subticties, we mnight ncw say, as did Bishop
Latirner in 1556 when the flarnes of martyrdom engulfed hirn:
We shall this day light such a candie, by
God's grace, in England, as I trust shail neyer
be put out.
Canada has just fought a tragic and costly
war in the defence of civil rights and fîindamental freedorns. Is the Parliarnent of Canada
now to say that we do not know what they are,
or that what we fought for is so nebulous in
our mind that we cannot put our principles
into words?
This committee had it in its hands to
declare, to Canada and to the world, a charter
of Canadian liberty. It could have phrased
exalted thoughts, if it had had any, in majestic
words that might have rung in the ears of
generations to corne, and adrnonished judges
and guided statesmen, in this and other lands,
front this tirne on.
For two years your committee has deliberated, and this uninspiring, drab and negative
confession of ineptitude is the armour of
freedom it has forged. For two years the
mountain has laboured-and it has brought
forth this mouse.
Do you wonder that I say I arn disappointed? I arn voicing these views because 1
know that this miserable report is flot the last
of this subject, not the last of the struggle for
freedom or of resistance to tyranny. I believe
this committee capable of much better thîngs,
and I now express the hope that it will be
given another opportunity at the next session
of parliarnent to complete the task to which it
was dedicated.
On rnotion of Hon. Mr. Aseltine the debate
was adjourned.
INDIAN ACT
REPORT 0F JOINT COMMITTEE

Hon. IVA C. FALLIS: Honourable senators,
as a member of the Joint Comrnittee of the
Senate and the House of Commons appointed
to examine into the Indian Act, the fact that
concurrence in the cornrittee's report has not
been moved is rather disturbing to me. I

681

should like to know what will happen to the
report if prorogation cornes tonight.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I was under the
impression that the report was rnerely to be
tabled for consideration in both houses of
parliarnent; but I arn not sure whether it was
tabled in the other place. The honourable
senator frorn Norfolk (Hon. Mr. Taylor),
chairman of the Senate section of the coinrnittee, is not in his seat. There are two possible
courses of action: one, to move concurrence
ini the report, and the other, to move
that the report be tabled for the information
of the house.
*Hon. Mrs. FAbLIS: The point that is
bothering me is this. The report, of course,
will go to the governiment for consideration
before anything is done about it. I was wondering whether the report would have the
saine effectiveness if it were tabled as if it
were adopted.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Su far as 1 know,
there has heen no discussion of the report in
the other place, and I arn not clear as to the
pre.scnt position of affairs with regard to it.
If parliarnent should prorogue today, I might
move at the conclusion of the sitting that the
report be tabled; or if any member of the
comrnittee is more conversant with the subjeet
than I amn, and should desire to speak to the
report, or, in the absence of the honourable
senator from Norfolk, move that it be concurred in, I would have no objection.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: I rnight point out
that the report is printed in, the Minutes of
Proccedings under date of June 22.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: If we should
adi ourn until next week, we could leave the
matter until then. If we should conclude our
session today, I might ask, leave of the house
to have the report officially tabled. Is that
suggestion acceptable to the honourable senator frorn Peterborough?
Hon. Mrs. FALLIS: I arn interested in
knowing what would be the rnost effective way
of bringing the report to the attention of the
government. To drop it from the Order Paper
does not seem the rnost satisfactory way of
dealing with it.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Between now and
the tirne we re-assemble I shaîl sec what disposition has been made of the report in the
other place, and recommend accordingly. Should
there be a motion for concurrence. I would be
at some disadvantage in trying to explain the
contents of the report. Perhaps it would be
sufficient to table it.

SENATE

Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Could the bionourable senator from Peterborough flot move the
adoption of the report after further information
bias been received?
Hon. Mrs. FALLIS: I will move adoption,
if the honourable leader of this bouse tbinks it
proper for me te do se. I do net wish to usurp
the rights of tbe chairman of tbe Senate section
of the committee.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Should tbe other
bouse concur in tbe report, we might take
advantage of tbe wisdom and eloquence of the
bonourable senator from Peterborough, and
ask that sbe move concurrence in the report on

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: llonourablc scnators, the business of the boeuse is almost concludcd, and xve are now awaiting reccipt of the
Suppl 'v Bill from anoilber place. Among the
few items left on our Order paper is a motion
in my name cencerning the national capital.
There is aise an eider for the second reading
of tbe Bankruptcy Bill. It will bc recalled tbat
sorne limne ago I stated thit m-v primary purpose in introducing this bill was to makie it
available at once for distribution amiong interested parties, but that it would not be procceded
with tbis session. As te tbe resolutiors concerning the agreements on tariffs and tradte, the
Prim(, Minister lias announced tht; lie is net
a-lxmng parliament te approve themi at the
prescrit sesion.
Recently I dî'ew attention te tbe splendid
serv ires rendered during tbe session by the
Standing Comnîiiittees on 1)ixor-ce ani on
Immigration and Labour. I sbhould now like
te ptay a similar tribute te our other Standing
Commitîcee-. net by specific references, but by
recording a general appreciation of tbeir
devotion and their skilful andi painstaking
work. I think it is seif-evident that departmental and other wvitnesses w'ho appcar before
eur committees show a healtbv respect for
the intelligent and keen questioning of coinmittee members.
Comparisons would be invidious, but I
should like te refer te the work done by the
Standing Committees on Banking and Commerce, Private Buis. Canadien Trade Relatiens, Transport and Communicat ions, and
Naturel Resources. Sorne of the other coin-

mittees aise bave bad excellent meetings. For
instance, tbe Cominittee on Public Buildings
and Grounds, presided e-ver by the bonourable
senator frem Thunder Bay (Hen. Mr. Paterson) held an interesting discussion abeut the
futur e plans for thîe develrspmieît of the city
of Ottnwa.
I tbink 1 should refer te tbe out.standing
aecomplisbment of tbe Standing Committee on
Transport and Communications while dealing
with a very difficuit railway bill. In acting as
mediators bctween the two major railway cernpenies of Canada-the Canadien National and
the Canadien Pacifie-the committec members
dispieyed tlicir talents in a new light. By facilitating witbdrawal of the legisîntion. they were
able te effeet a most happy solution.
It
seems te me tbat this fact deserves more tban
passing notice.
Honourable senators, I bav'e just been
advised by tbe Clerk that, the House of Commens, without any debate, concurred Ibis
morning in the report of the Joint Commiittee
on Indian Affairs.
When tbe Senate reassembles today, perbaps tbe boneurable enator
from Peterborough (Hon. Mrs. Fallis) will
explain the details of the report and mox e
concurrence in it.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: When presenting
tbe report of the Joint Cornxnittee on ludian
Affairs te Ibis bouse on June 2, the bonourable
senator from N orfolk (Hon. Mr. Taylor) said:
I shaîl meve concurrence in the report on
Thursday next, when it will be ia printed form.
Tbcrefore, tbe report is awaiting a metion

APPENDIX

THE DRAFT DECLARATION OF HUMAN RIGHTS
Preamble
Whereas recognition of the inherent dignity
and of the equal and inalienable rights of
all members of the human family is the foundation of freedom, justice and peace in the
world, and
Whereas disregard and contempt for human
rights resulted before and during the second
World War, in barbarous acts which outraged
the conscience of mankind and made it apparent that the fundamental freedoms were one
of the supreme issues of the conflict, and
Whereas it is essential, if mankind is not
to be compelled as a last resort to rebel
against tyranny and oppression, that human
rights should be protected by a regime of law,
and
Whereas the peoples of the United Nations
have in the Charter determined to reaffirm
faith in fundamental human rights and in the
dignity and worth of the human person and
to promote social progress and better standards of life in larger freedom; and
Whereas member states have pledged themselves to achieve, in co-operation with the

respect for and observance of human rights
and fundamental freedoms; and

Hon. WISHART

ROBERTSON
mov-ed:
That this bouse is of the opinion,(1) That the requirements cf a national capital involve, from tinie te tinue, developments cf
a character beyond the municipal improvements
ordinarily required in other cities;
(2) That the development ot a national capital, is at least iii part a national responsibility,

of tbe city et Ottawa as a national capital in

capital ot Canada iii u ars

as may lie recommended, by the tederal district

witbi the plan;
(6) That it is (lesiralile tînt the work, necessary te this cnd be iiinder tbe supervisien of tbe
Federal District Commission, distinct froia its
ordinary operationsý;

(7) that the expend-iture cf meneys for tbese
purposes should Ne conditional on tbe effective
ce-eperation et tbe city of Ottawa and otbcr
municipalities xithin the national capital district.
He said: I have asked the bonouraible senator from Thunder Bay (Hon. Mr. Paterson)
te speak to, tbis resolution. As honeturable
senators will remember, he was chairman of
the committee that had before it representatives cf tbe Federal; District Commission, and
con.sidered plans and long-term proposals in
connection wjth the city of Ottawa.
Hon. -NORMAN MeL. PATERSON: Honcurable senators, it would take at least a twoheur speech

te properly

handle this subject.

As it is a bot day, and I have neyer made a
two-hour speech in my life, I shaîl only burden
yeu for fifteen cr twenty minutes.

This is an ea.y motion to speak to, because
it is about your city, my city, the most beautifui city in Canada-Ottawa. As we aIl know,
it is located on the confluence of tbree rivers,
the Rideau, the Gatineau, and that, wonderful
river, the Ottawa, which provides a waterway
towards the sea for navigation by boats of a
limited size.
The bistorical value of Ottawa cannot be
stressed too much. Samuel Champlain passed
the site of Ottawa in 1613. In 1800 Philemon
Wright established a settlement where the
city of Hull now stands, and in about 1820 one
Nicholas Sparks came over to this side of the
river and located on ]and which is now in the
heart of Ottawa. In 1827 this settiement was
given the name Bytown. In 1854 it became
Ottawa. and in 1857 was cliosen by Queen Victoria as the capital et Canada. Ten years later,
in 1867. the Britih North America Act confirnîcd it as the c-apital of Canada. wbich it xvas
to rernain until otberwise directed hy Her
Majesty.
Through the years Ottawa has dcvelopcd as
a diplomatic centre. At the pre' ent time there
are twenty-five or thirty foreign offices or
ogencies in Ottawa, represcnting varjous ceeatries throughout the world. and eventually
there xvili be over seventy. From this it will
Ne seen that as time gees on the city will
irncrease in size and importance.
The xidoi cf planning abead in the development cf tlîis city is well illustrated by what,
liappenend te WVashington. Ia 1791 Washington
anil Jefferson cemrniss-ioncd Pierre Charles
IL'Enfants te prepare plans for the dcx elopmuent of that city. At that time there were
oaly 4.000.000 people living in the United
States, and the capital was planned for a
population of froma 500,000 to 800,000 inhabitats. The plan provoked great ridicule, and
ia 1825 it was abnndoned. However, in 1900
it xvas again proceeded with, and, although the
cast xvas terrifie, a magnificent city was created
out cf a piece cf flat land.
The Ottawa plans cf Jacques GreNer and
bis associates cover a future peried cf from
eighty te a hundred years. There is ne intentien at this time cf appropriating the full
ameunt cf money te be spent on these wonderfuI plans, but something has te be started new.
The city is growing rapidly and the transportation system
needs immediate
attention.
Moneys are required for alterations which are
te be worked eut in accerdance with the
general plan. If these alterations are net made
flow by the Federal District Commission. the
City cf Ottawa itscîf might proceed te niake
changes that would net be in line xxith the
general long-distance plan. Consequently. the

JUNE 28, 1948

motion calls for the creation in advance of a
fund to meet the cost of projects which may be
recommended from time to time by the Federal
District Commission, a fund to which in future
further amounts will be voted to carry out
the long-distance plan.
As the leader of the government has stated,
the Standing Committee on Public Buildings
and Grounds had on exhibition a magnificent
model of the proposed layout, and plans for
the development of the National Capital.
Following this exhibition the committee made
A final report was
a preliminary report.
not made, because the committee felt that
there should be further opportunity given to
see the plans.
Unfortunately, because so many other committee meetings were being held at the time,
these plans did not receive the attention that
our committee had hoped for. In the other
house this morning there was some complaint
that the plans had not been given sufficient
publicity and that that house was not well
informed about them. If that is so, it is really
the fault of honourable members of that house,
for the plans, which fully explained Ottawa's
future development, were on exhibition here
for a week, and were seen by the mayor of
Ottawa and some of the city councillors as well
as by a few members of the government.
Honourable senators, I do not know that
there is anything further I need to say on the
importance of planning for the National
Capital.
Honourable
Hon.
Mr. ROBERTSON:
senators, I should like to be permitted to say
a word in addition to the excellent explanation that has just been made by the honourable gentleman from Thunder Bay (Hon. Mr.
Paterson). I think that the procedure whereby
parliament expresses its long-term intention in
this important matter, while reserving the
right to provide year by year the amount
necessary for developments as they proceed,
will commend itself to a majority of the
people of Canada. Perhaps it would be easy
to suggest that specific appropriations from
the national revenue might be spent to better
effect in other parts of the country, but it
seems to me that there is a general feeling.
which will make itself more and more evident
as time goes on, that the efforts of man should
be joined to the natural advantages which
this area provides, for the purpose of creating
a national capital of which Canadians everywhere can be proud.
I do not think that anyone could reasonably
deny that, as was said by my honourable
friend from Thunder Bay, it is desirable to
have a carefully prepared plan for future
5853--45

developments. Each of us, wherever we live,
can look back and sec how our respective communities would have been greatly improved if
a plan-perhaps in some cases a relatively
simple one-had been laid down years ago and
followed in the interval.
It seems to me desirable that parliament
should concur in the proposal that consideration be given to future development in this
respect. It is natural that those charged with
the responsibility of making these plans should
assume a greater degree of certainty as to
what future parliaments will do than this
resolution suggests, or that the passing from
year ta year of specific amounts in the estimates for certain projects would contemplate.
A definite plan of development covering the
next five or ten years, which would bind this
country and future parliaments to make certain expenditures, is something that I do not
think would meet with the approval of the
Canadian people. My opinion is, therefore,
that parliament should now consider the question in a general way and express the belief
that there should be a co-ordinated plan of
development for the future. It should also
give direction to those responsible for the
carrying out of the scheme, and from time to
time should have the opportunity of reviewing it in the light of existing circumstances.
By such a long-range plan we can look forward
to a more continuous development in the
beautification of the national capital and the
surrounding area.
It is inevitable that as between the federal
government and the corporations of the city
of Ottawa and the adjoining municipalities
there will be differences of opinion. Paragraph
7 of the resolution states that:
The expenditure of moneys for these purposes
should be conditional on the effective co-o.peration of the city of Ottawa and other municipalitics within the National Capital district.
It seems ta me that as time goes on and the
people become more familiar with the project,
publie opinion will demand effective co-operation from the municipalities concerned.
I commend this resolution to honourable
senators for favourable consideration.
Hon. R. B. HORNER: Honourable senators
are aware that I am opposed to this grandiose
scheme for the development of the national
capital. I objected to the proposal when it

was first discussed, and at that time I read
letters from certain prominent men in Canada
who, I argued, were competent to undertake
the management of such a development. I
still believe that we need not have imported a
man to direct this beautification scheme.

SENATE

I maintain that if the authorities would
agree to my method of financing such undertakings, Canada could develop not only her
national capital, but many other things in
all parts of the country, for the benefit of the
people. All over this country people are living
in shacks because, by reason of high taxation,
they are unable to provide thenselves with
proper accommodation. Yet they are to be
taxed further to promote a scheme under which
many excellent and useful buildings, including,
I understand, a number of dwelling houses, are
to be torn down or practically destroyed. To
me the destruction of property and the tearing down of buildings is most regrettable. I
suppose that our very fine Union Station is
marked for destruction. I am reminded of the
New Testament parable which tells of the
fate of the man whose ambition was to tear
down his barns and build greater.
In spite of the serious situation of the world
today, we are going to develop a great national
capital. I believe such a project would be
justified only if we were living under conditions of security, and after we had done enough
to satisfy our own people that conditions in
this country are what they ought to be. I
am reminded of another biblical passage which
teaches us that the house of the man who
builds on the sand is soon washed away, and
that to have permanency one must build on
a rock. By analogy this can be taken to
mean that all proper measures must be taken
for the defence of this country, to ensure, so
to speak, a proper title and continuity of
ownership before large sums of money are
expended on the property. Listening to the
debate in the other place, I heard one of the
members argue that the fulfilment of this
scheme would be a great manifestation and
example of national unity. But in my view,
before making large outlays on the improvement of the national capital, we should take
note of the present world crisis and determine
by what methods our capital can be defended.
I have the greatest interest in the future of
our country and in methods of efficiently
defending it; and to my mind the first step
towards unity is to decide on ways and means
of national self-preservation, preferably by
means of the draft and equal responsibility in
matters of defence. To undertake great improvement schemes without an adequate system of defence is like building on sinking or
shifting sands. At least, before we go too far
with a scheme which involves large expenditures of money and considerable destruction of
property. we should be sure that the people of
Canada favour action at this time to develop
the national capital.
Hon. C. L. BISHOP: This, honourable
senators, is a noble project for making Ottawa

and district what it ought to be-a really
national capital. Belonging as it does to all
of Canada, it is a national responsibility. It
fully merits the very substantial appropriation
parliament is making and the warm approval
which it has been given. As one of the
senators for Ottawa, I wish to associate myself
with all that has been so well said and so
properly said in this house in endorsement of
the project.
I think it is a very fine thing for the Prime
Minister to choose this subject as possibly the
last that he may put forward in his capacity
of leader of parliament. It indicates his deep
and unfailing interest in the embellishment of
the city and district, and in giving it the
status of a "national capital" in the fullest
sense of the word.
Hon. NORMAN P. LAMBERT: Honourable senators, I think it would be appropriate
to say a word or two about the background of
this resolution. Three years ago I had the
privilege of being a representative from this
chamber on the joint committee of both houses
which considered this subject. It was a most
interesting experiene to serve on that committee, whose sessions extended over a month,
because, as the problems which had to be
deait with were considered, opinion crystallized into a unanimous and national view
regarding the development of the capital. It
will be remembered, I think, that the joint
committee, the membership of which included
representatives from every province in Canada,
unanimously agreed upon its report. This
report re.sulted in certain amendments of the
Federal District Act which enabled the Federal
District Commission, through the National
City Planning Commission, to deal with plans
in detail in conjunction with Mr. Greber. An
aspect of the Federal District Com'mission's
work which was not dealt with in the report
relates to the area, known as the park area,
which extends out through the Gatineau hills.
That section of the work was laid aside for
the time being, while attention was concentrated upon the improvement of the national
capital itsel-f.
Mr. Greber. who before the war had prepared some plans and suggestions, was asked
to return to Ottawa and complete his work.
He was responsible to the National City Planning Commission, whicb was set up under the
authority of the Federal District Commission.
Subsequently the plans were completed. A
great deal of work has been done in the three
years which have passed since the joint committee's report was made. Today the National
City Planning Committee, in association with

JUNE 28, 1948
Mr. Greber, has committed to paper a plan
for t:he developmen't of Ottawa over a period
of years.
The resolution before us si'mply sets down
the principle that certain moneys will be
needed to oa&rry out the work. It specifies no
amount, but it relates particularly this year
to an item of $2;500,0O0, to be inclided in the
supplementary estimates for the purpose of
building a bridge which was publicly mentioned last year. The bridge is to e»tend from
the end of Albert street across the canal and
the railway tracks, and on through to Waller
streeet, thus providing a parallel outiet for
the traffic whioh is now so mucli congested et
rush hours in the area fronting Confederation
Square and, the Chateau. The building of this
bridge is therefore one of the first essentials
in laying the foundation for the future development of the national, capital, not on-ly from
the point of view of the capital city, 'but also
from the point of view of the district of
Ottawa, which enjoys .many 'benefits froim the
increasing nusnber of tourists entering the city
every year.
There are other important improvements
whic,h are almost equally essential, but they
cannot be proceeded with i'mmediately because
of the necessity for conserving financial
resources. Three years ago the joint committee, in its report, recommended that the railway terminal be moved to a subumban location
in order to leave the central part of the city
open to a more desirable arrangement than
now exists. It also recommended that at the
earliest, possible moment a modemn sewage disposai plant be established for Ottawa and Hull.
At the present time there is a very undesirable
and discreditable condition in connection with
sewage waste in the Ottawa River, which runs
between properties owned- by the people of
this couintry. These are just two or three
aspect.s of the work that lies ahead.
In connection with the $21 million that is
included in the supplementary estimates to
defray the expense of building this bridge,
attention should be drawn to ola-use 7 of this
motion:
That the expenditure of moneys for these purposes should be conditional on the effective cooperation of the city of Ottawa and other municipalities within the national capital di@trict.
This menus that without what is termed
"ýeffective co-operation", it would be impossible
for the federal authorities, through the planning commission, to build this bridge or
effeet any other improvements. Certain
expenditures in connection with the approaches
to this bridge will inescapably have to be
5853-45J

borne by the city of Ottawa itself. The
amnount of these expenditures is not known,
but is now being determined by the engineers.
In view of the fact that the Dominion Government is providing $2ý million, it is certainly to be hoped that the municipaiity of
Ottawa will not find it difficult to provide the
money for the necessary approaches to the
bridge. During the past fifteen years the city
of Ottawa bas been successful in reducing its
debenture debt fromn something like $28 million to seven or eight million. The proposed
expenditure, which migh-t be regarded as of a
capital nature, will undoubtedly pay many
dividends in the forma of increasing tourist
traffie and other incidentai benefits. Anybody
who lias passed through the eye-of-the-needle
area adjoining the National Monument, knows
that there is great need f or relief in the
traffie situation of Ottawa.
Apart altogether from local interest, the
national aspect of this whole beautification
scheme, which it is hoped will be matured
and brouglit into effect over the years, will
do something towards reflecting what undoubtedly bas been evident to ail of us during and
sin-ce the war. I refer to the national unîty
and solidarity of this country. I think that
Canadians today, regardless of where they
live, feel that they have more in common and
are dloser together than ever before. Something to refleet that fact and represent worthily
the aspiration of our people for a definitely
individualistie and united Canada, can be
found in a sensible and artistic development
of Ottawa as the capital city of this country.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: Can the honourable
senator tell me how mucli money it is proposed to spend on this scheme during the
coming year?
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: Two and a haîf
million is the amnount that is mentioned in
the supplementary estimates for the purpose
of building this bridge. In addition to that, of
course, there is the grant that lias been made
to the Federal District Commission for its
regular work. That grant was made on a threeyear basis and does not come up this year.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: Is it ýproposed to
build the bridge this year?
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: It is proposed to
start the bridge just as soon as the city of
Ottawa agrees upon the expenses involved in
the approaches to the bridge.

SENATE

Honourable
lon. W. M. ASEI.TINE:
senators, this appeais te me te be a very
important motion. 1 arn sorry indeeci that
tiiere are so fewv scnators proscrit to gve it
the consideration that 1 think, it shoul(l have.
1 do not know that I arn prepared to agr-e
to the spending of any lar-ge amonoit of money
on the s-hc me a t this timie, bc causr, wor1d
conditions, as stated by the hionourable
senator from Blaine Lake (Hon. Mir. Horner),
are xery serions. We do not know but that in
the veiy ncar future ive mayx hc ohliged to
defond ihis country of ours against aggression
fronî Europe or- Asia.
I ivas present at the exhibition of the
plans and specifleations for the beautification
of Ottawa, for wlîich tlie lionourable senator
froin Thunder Bay (Hon. Mr. Paterson) was
responsible. 1 was very rnuch disappointed that
onlv two or- tlîree other senators were present.
The schemre outlined by Mr. Greber ivas very
c.omprelicnsive. It called for the wrerking of
a great many buildings and the rc-arranging of
streets to alleviate the trafflo congestion on
In my
Rideau streets.
Wellington and
opinion this would cost many hundreds of
millions of dollars, and I think that before
we procecd wil.h anything like that we should
have a consultation wiih the other provinces.
Paragraph 7 of the motion rcads:
Tlhat the expcnditîîre of money s for these
purpeses should bo conditional on the effective
other
ce-operation of the ýCity of Ottawa anso
muncipalities withiri the national capital district.
It seems te nie that before much moncy is
spent we should make sure whether in these
preposoti developmnents wo have the efrective
co-oporat ion of the previnces-Ontarie and
Quebec in particular-as woîî as that of the
city of Ottawa a.nd tho adjoining municipahities.
As pointed eut by the honeurable senater
from Blaine Lake, at the presenit time this
country is faced with such serious problems
as national defence and laek of housing; and
until we have done more about these matters
it weuld perlîaps be well te pestpone any
groat oxpenditures on the beautification of
Ottawa.
Theugh I have tlîought it well te make
these few remarks, I do net intcnd te oppose
the moetion.
The motion was agreed to.
INDIAN ACT

Hon. WILLIAM H. TAYLOR: Honourable senators, I regret having heeni absent
from a proviens sitting when the order for
consideration of this report was called. Since
then the other house lias, without, disctussion
concurred in thc committee's report, and I
therefore now inove that the Sonate aIse concur in it.
As the report statos, the committee has
been sitting during the last threce sessions. In
1946 evidence was heard from departmental
officials; during the next session uve had
befere us Indians representing tho v arious
reservos throughout Canada, and at the
presenit session we continued and conîpleted
our examination of tire Indian Act.
The committee deeris it advisahle that
alanost every section of the Act sheuld bo
oither rcpealed or amcnded, ani a draft bill
rs at presenit before the law officers of the
Crown. One of the recommendations in the
report is that immcdiately parliamoent. next
reassembles a special joint committee ho constîtuted with powers similar te, those grantod
te the committee this yoar, nnd that the draft
brll ho referred te it. Thcrecfore. concurrence
in the report will net nocessarily nîran adoption of our recommondations, fer the.se will
come bofore parliamont noxt sesîorî in the
ferm of amendmenu,, te the Act.
The cemmittee lias made varions reocoinmeondations wlîich it helievos will improvo
administration of the Act fromn the peint of
view of the Indians themselves. I might caîl
attention te this paragraph in orrr report:
AIl proposed rovisierîs are dlesigned te make
possible the graduaI transition of Indians from
te adIwardship te citizenship and te help thera
vanice themnselves.
I should like te take this oppertu:nity of
thanking all members of the Sonate section
of the joint committee for their faithfni
attendance at meetings. The revising of the
Act, section by section. was perhaps net as
nnteresting as some of the work donc during
the twe precoding sessions, but the committee
feels that its report, te which its members
nnanimously agreed, will ho of great benefit
te the Indians of Canada.
The motion was agreed te.

The Sonate preceeded te consideratien of
the fourth report of the Joint Cemmittee on
the Indian Act.

REPORT 0F JOINT COMMITTEE

The Senate rcsumed from June 26 the
adjourncd debate on the motion of Hon.
Mr. Gouin for concurrence in the final report
of the Special Joint Committee on Human
Righits and Fundamental Freedoms.
Hon. WV. M. ASELTINE: Honourable
senaters, my reason for moving the adjourement of the debate on this motion was to find
out exaetly how the matter was deait witb
in another place. I find that it was debated
pro and con in that bouse. following which
the report was tabled. In the Senate tHe
report lia, bccn pi esnted and explained, andi
we have hicard a sjîeecii in opposition te it. I
would suggest that in this honourable chamber
the report be dealt with as it wvas in another
place, that is, thait it le tahled.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I arn quite in
agreement with the acting leader of the
opposition (Hon. Mr. Aseltine).
I think,
though. that he is perhiaps in error in saying
that the report was discussed in another place,
for i rv understanding is that it was tabled
thcre without discussion. As concurrence in
the report lias been moved here, my honeurable friend mniglit move in amendment,' if it
is agr-eable to the mover (Hon. Mr. Goin),
that the report ho flot concurredi in, but t'hat
it Le tablcd. I should be happy to support
such an arnendment.
Hon. Mi. ASELTINE: I so move.
The amendment of Hon. Mr. Asieltine ivas
agreed to, and the report wvas tabled.

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: HonouraLle senators, I arn obliged to refer to the provisions
of the Lill in round figures, because I have
flot the exact amounts Lofore me. As honourable sonators know, the ostimatos we are
cailed upon te conisider Lave Leen for some
time Lefore our Finance Committee, Ly
whom the dotails of the proposed expenditures
were carefully studied. I shahl confine rny
remnaiks te a comparisoni cf round figures.
under varieus categories, with our expenditures

JUNE 29, 1948
in 1939, since when, as honourable members
know, very marked increases have occurred.
The entire main estimates aggregate $1,985
million, and there are first supplementaryetmates of $197 million and further supplementaries of $10, 0 00,000--a total of $2,192 million.
Compared with the total authorized expenditure last year of $2,199 million, there is a s9light
decrease, amounting to roughly $7,000,000. In
the last ten years the sure required for national
expenditures has risen fromn $553 million to
$2,192 million. I do nlot need to enlarge on the
fact that this is a very aubstantial increase.
Rather than attempt a detailed analysis of
these estimates, I propose to divide thema into
six classifications, namely fiscal, military, social
security, public works, subsidies, and aIl others,
and to quote some comparative figures as I
go along.
Under the classification "fiscal" I include
interest on public debt and payments ta
provinces. Honour9ble senators will be interested to know that whereas in 1939 the total
expenditures under this head were $142 million,
the total of the main estimates and supplementaries amouats this year ta $554 million.
The next classification is "military," coinprisiag national defeace and expenditures in
connection with ail ferrms of assistance ta
veterans. In 1939 the total was $77,000,000;
today it is $575 million, lacking only 82,000,000
of an increase of $500 million.
Under "social security" five items are
included, namely family allowances, old age
and blind pensions; unemployment insurance;
health grants; and other services. Our total
expenditure in 19M was 876,000,000; today
provision under the main and aupplementary
estimates amounts to $425 million.
In the category of "public works" is included housing, other reconstruction, public
works and flood relief. The last-named
item, for which $10,000,000 is provided, ls
for assistantce in British Columbia. Public
works expenditures in 1939 were 821,000,000;
this year the amount ta be vrov'ided is $197
million, an increase of 3176 million. Housing
alone accouats for $69,000,000.
The Wartime Prices and Trade Board and
Agricultural Subsidies showed a blaak for
1939, but the estimated expenditures for this
year are 861,000,000.
In 1939 expeaditures for ordiaary fuactions
of goverament, with which honourable senators
are aIl familiar, amouated ta 8237 million,' as
compared with a figure of 8380 million for
1948.
The activities of certain government departments have been increased, as has the wage

693

scale, but the outstandiag feature ia relation
ta the total expeaditure la the increase ta
$2,192 million froin the relatively small figure
of $553 million. The maijor items of increase
are in connection with interest on the public
debt, payments ta provinces, national defence,
veterans affairs, social security, aad various
types of public works, including housiag.
Whether or not these figures should have been
materially less is a matter of opinion. Although
there is always demand for a material reduction in the cost of goverameat, it must be
remembered that there has been steady pressure for an increase of many af these items.
It is questionable whether the estimate of
$251 million for national defence is enough.
Maay eminent public men with military
expericace dlaim that it should be much
larger. An amount of $324 millions has been
set aside for veterans affaira. Few would suggest that it should be reduced, but there are
maay who think it should be increased. I
believe that in the later part of the session
representations were made ta the Veterans'
Committee in another place ta have the
already huge suma increased. And se it is
dowa the scale.
Ilonourable senators, I have not attcmptcd
ta go into any of the couatless dctails-with
many of which I am not too familiar-because
1 did not anticipate that we would have so
much time at aur disposai at this period of the
session. But I thought the house would like
ta have a brief reference ta pre-war expenditures la those six classifications, with which ail
honourable senators are familiar.
Hon. W. M. ASELTINE: Honourable
senators, the figures which the leader of the
goverament has juat given us are startling, ta
say the least. We had aIl heen hopiag that
in the ycars following the end of the war the
governmcnt's expenditures would have decreased much more than they appear ta have
done.
Howcver, this chamber seemiagly
cannot do much about the matter.
As the leader of the goverament stated,
these estimates have been hefore us in priatcd
forma for some weeks, and I have no doubt
that honourable senators have been studying
them. I have speat severai days goiag over
the long liat of items, and I find that some
of thema are very interesting. I evea noticed
anc of 825,000 for a public building at Rosetown, Saskatchewan.
Hon. Mr. HORNER: Why build anything
there?
Hlon. Mr. ASELTINE: I hope that is for a
aew post office building, for we have none
there aow that is worthy of the naine. I have

SENATE

ne hesitatien in saying that the postal revenues
from RoSetown are larger than these frein any
other town of equal size in tbe Dominion, and
during tbe last twenty years we have been
agitating for a building suitable te the volume
of business that is done. At Rosetown we aIse
bave quite a large branch of the Royal Canadian Meunted Police, and I hope the government intends te make the new post office
building large enougb te accommodate tbat
force as well.
Frein the copy of tbe supply bill that 1 have
before me I observe that subsection 1 cf section
4 emipcwers the Goveinor in Council te raise
a boan of $200 million foir public works and
general purpoes, and I take it that this sumn
is in addition te tbe other estîrnates. I sbould
lîke te ask the leader of the goveroment if he
has any information as te wbat publie werks
are intended te be undertaken with this
moneý'
I notice in the estimatca numerous items of
expendituire foir piers. harheur facilities. dredging, buildings and other public works througheut the Mar'itime Provinîces, Quebee and
Ontario, but except for work being denc along
the Fraser river, ne provision is made for such
imprevements in the western provinces and
British Columbia.
The estimates pros ide that the sum of
8100,0C0 -wbiclî I presume is an annualex
penditre-be set aside te cever the cest cf
the cemmiiittce appeinted te inquire into and
make plans for tbe beautificatien cf Ottawa.
Hon. Mr. HORNER:
Is any allowance
mode for guide services, te direct the people
when tbe beautifleation sebeme has been
completed?
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: The bill just shows
the lump sumn of $100,000. The plans and
specifications foir this development bave been
in course of preparatien for a, number of y cars,
and it seems te me that by this time tbey
should be in stîcb forma as te indicate exactly
what it is intended te do in the future. I
believe tbat the services of the planneis sbould
be dispensed w'itb, and that instead cf our
paying large sums te peeple outside the
country. we sbould place the matter in the
bonds of Canadian engineers and arcbitects.
1 am srîrprised te see this large item in the
estimates. particularly when we are anxîous
to eut down expenditures.
Notwitbstanding wbat I bave said about
reducing expenditures, I sbould like te sec the
goverrament spend seme meney on reepening
"Levers' Walk' around the Parliament Buildings. Wben I came te Ottawa in 1925 that
was eue cf tbe beauty spots of the city; but

it has been cloSed for several years because it
is said to, be îînsafe. I -uggest to the government that the reopening of that walk would be
an attraction to people visiting Ottawa from
other parts of Canada and thc United States.
I do flot suppose that the Parliament of
Canada lias anything to do with the practice
of lining the city of Ottawa streets with
garbage cans in the mornings. When I get
up early te go for n walk, and see a line of
these containers stretching into the distance,
it is not a pleasant sight. 1 hope the honourable senator from Ottawa (Hon. Mr. Lambert)
will take note of this situation.
In my remarks on the beautification sebeme
yesterday I forgot to mention the lack of
town-planning whicb is so apparent in the
city of Ottawa. In every ether city I have
visited, and ccrtainly in those of western
Canada, provision is made for lancways behind
the buildings. wbcrc garbage mnay be deposited
and collectcd. It wvould seem to me that the
(ity cf Ottawxa should in the near future consider the advisability of making prov ision for
gai bage collection. especially iii new ubdivisions wberc there i.. plentv cf land. The lioncurable senator from Ottawa may have sonîrt bing te say, on this point.
At the outset of mv remarks 1 said that 1
did net think we could do muciih at this time
wýitl regardl to these itcms. As thc leader of
the government bas pointed out, we have
studied tbem in the Finance Comrnittee; we
have also studied tibem in our roems; and I
migbt add tbat, te make myseîf as wellinformed as possible, I bave been a faithful
attendant in the gallery of tbe House of
Commens, wbere I listened to the explanatiens witb reference te hundreds of items.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTS ON: Tbe honourable
senater from Rosetown asked a question
relating te section 4 of the draft bill empewering loans of $200 million for public works and
general purposes. I speak subjeet te correction, but I tbink tbat each year there is an
identical provision in the Appropriation Act
te enable the government te meet any
deficiency of cash revEnues whicb may arise
during the ensuing year. As I understand it,
the provision is net cf the nature cf longtermi borrowing fer any specifie work, but is
financing-for
temperary
te provi(le for
instance, te redeem treasury buis or mcet, other
current obligations. Section 4, subsection 4 of
tbe bill centains these words:
ing pewers authorized
'AIl chapter seventî -eight; of the by section
statutes of
five cf borron
1947 w'hieh are oiitqta-ndirg and unused shaîl
expire on the date cf the cemicg inte force of
tbis Act.

JUNE 29, 1948
And, by section 5; it is provided that:
5. A detailed account of the sums expended
under the authority of this Act shall be laid
before the House of Commons during the first
fifteen days of the then next session of parliament.
The borrowing powers contained in these
sections automatically lapse upon the date of
the coming into force of the next Appropriation Act.
As regards the specific estimate relating to
Rosetown, I hope the honourable senator who
represents that district (Hon. Mr. Aseltine) is
t
rightly informed. I cannot profess · o have any
detailed knowledge of these matters, but the
item, it seems to me, may be regarded as
an illustration of the reluctance of this government to make expenditures on a partisan
basis. Although I am not very familiar with
the geography of Saskatchewan, I understand
that those who represent the constituency in
question cannot by any stretch of imagination
be looked upon as ardent supporters of this
administration.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: I am not really
responsible for the representation.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I have lot the
exact figures of proposed expenditures in the
Maritime Provinces, although I do not doubt
that they are relatively and, perhaps, almost
pitifully small; at all events, considering the
very great need in particular instances, they

5853-46

695

are less than they should be. And while it
may be true that the province of Saskatchewan lacks appropriations for piers and breakwaters, I have no doubt that these deficiencies
are more than made up in other directions.
Hon. R. B. HORNER: Honourable senators
well know that I rarely mention that wonderful home town of mine, Blaine Lake. I do not
want anyone to get the impression from this
that Blaine Lake is not a place of great
importance. Some ten years ago the government purchased two beautiful lots there with
the intention of building a post office.
Perhaps, if I had searched through the estimates, as did the honourable senator from
Rosetown (Hon. Mr. Aseltine), I would have
found that $25,000 or $30,000 had been set aside
for that building. I hope that is so, because
the postmistress there, who succeeded her
father, does not want to improve the building
because she does not own it. The war bas
been over for several years now, and as the
people have been expecting a new building for
some time, I do hope that some provision bas
been made for its construction.
Many honourable senators frequently boast
of their own cities or towns. Because I have
not followed that practice, I do not want it
thought that my home town of Blaine Lake is
not, as I have said, a place of importance.
The Senate adjourned until tomorrow at
11 a.m.

After which the Riglit Honourable the
Deputy of the Governor General was pleased
to close the Fourth Session of the Twentieth
Parliamient of Canada with the following
Speech:
Honourable Memnlers of the Senate:
Memnlers of the House of Commons:
World conditions continue to occasion anxiety.
Instead of the dloser co-operation which lied
been hoped for between all nations, the cleavage
between certain nations of eastern Europe and
nations of the western world lias become inereasingly marked. The sense of danger bas led, on
the part of free nations, to the establishmnent and
promotion of regional associations to ensure
their joint security and well-being. Canada lias
oontinurd, as opportunity bas afforded, to
further effective organization for international
peace and security. My ministers have made
clear our country's intention to assist in maintaining a prepooderance of strength on the aide
of the preservation of freedom.
The delay in resto-ring production in Europe
and Asia lias resulted in an unprecedented
dexnand for commodities f rom the Western
Hemisphere. This demand bas lied an inflationary effect on world prices. Higher world
prices have been reflected in rîsing domestic
prires. The effect of this on the cost of living
lias been of inrreasing concern to consumera.
While shortages of f ood and other supplies to
meet the demand abroad and at home have
resulted in increased prices, production in
Canada, to meet.this dem'and, lias led .to a -degree
of employment and prosperity not hitherto
ex!perienced.
My ministers are of the opinion that widespread controls of prices, so necessary at a time
of war, wouid prove prejudicial if me.intained
indefinitely in time of pence. Thie controls m*ade
necessary by war have *acordingly been progressively removed. As a means of resisting
inflationary pressures, certain convtrols have been
continued in this transitional period.
The whole question of prices and the cost cf
living lias been debated at lengtli in bath houses
of parliament. It lias been the su'bject of detailed investigation by a select committee of the
House of Commons. The investigation lias had a
restraining effect upon unjustiflable increases in
prices. The report of the committee deslerves
wide public attention. The government will give
mont careful consideration to its representations.
The inabîlity of Canada's Enropean customers
to pay for their importa resulted, during 1947,
in a serious depletion of our reserves of United
States dollars. To meet the critical situation
occasioned, by the shortage of United States
dollars to pay for our vastly încreased imnporta
f romn that country, it becanie necessary to impose
drastic and unpopular temporary restrictions on
our trade. You will rec-aîl that the ronsideration
of measures for this purpose necessitated beginning the esslion early in December. Dehate on
tese measures occupied a large part of ite
earlier .months.
It is gratifying to note that the measures
taken have helped not orly to stop the depletion,
but to replenieli Canala~s reserves of United
States dollars. The i.mplementation by the
United States of the European Recovery Pro.
gram will rontribute maîterîally to the samie end.
As our reserves increase, and our trade in
brought into better balance, restriction. will be

SENATE
progressively removed. A permanent solution of
our exchange problen depends, however, upon
the revival of world trade.
While much of your time lias been devoted to
a consideration of economic -and financial problems arising almost exclusively out of abnormal
world conditions, you have been careful to give
the necessary attention to those matters with
which, in ordinary times, parliament would lie
concerned.
Among measures related to agriculture, an
has been
agreement
wlieat
international
approved. Minimum prices for wheat and other
agricultural products have been increased. The
period during which agricultural prices may be
supported has been extended. Provision lias
been made for the reclamation of marsh lands
in the Maritime Provinces.
In the field of immigration, the movement of
desirable immigrants from the United Kingdom
and western Europe .as well as from the displaced persons camps bas been accelerated. A
large number of close relatives of persons residing in Canada have been admitted, and provision
aas been made to hasten the admission of others.
In the field of industrial relations, legislation
nas been enacted respecting the investigation,
conciliation and settlement of disputes in industries over which parliament bas jurisdiction. It
is hoped that ýthis legislation will provide a
model throughout Canada for legislation respecting industrial disputes. Provision lias been
made for the payment of larger benefits under
the Unemployment Insurance Act. The scope of
the Vocational Training Co-ordination Act bas
been widened.
With respect to the affairs of veterans and
their dependents, a thorough study of existing
legislation and related matters bas been made by
a select committee of the House of Commons.
The veterans charter bas been amended in the
light of the experience of the past three years.
Pensions of disabled veterans and of pensioned
dependents have been increased. Larger allowances have been provided for married veterans
in training. Other veterans' benefits have been
broadened.
The welfare of Indians lias been the subject
of careful study by a select joint committee of
the Senate and the Hise of Commons. The
committee continued and completed the examination of the Indian Act begun in 1946.
In relation to the housing problem, it is to be
noted that more houses were built in 1947 than
in any previous year. The National Ilousing
Act bas been amended to assist in meeting the
need for rental housing. Provision, on a substantial scale, of quarters for servicemen and
their families is contributing materially te the
total available housing accommodation.
A most significant advance in the government's
policy for the establishment of a national minimum of social security and human welfare bas
been the development, in the present session, of a
national health program. Provision bas been
made on a generous scale for annual grants to
the provinces, over a period of years, to assist
in the development of bealth plans and in the
improvement of existing health services in both

urban and rural areas. The health grants will
be of immediate benefit in making possible much
needed increased hospital facilities throughout
Canada, as well as in the prevention and treatment of disease. The grants also constitute an
essential prerequisite to the establishment of a
nation-wide system of health insurance.
Other important measures enacted during the
session were bills respecting the Canada Shipping Act, the Board of Transport Commissioners,
the Dominion Elections Act, the revision and
smplifieation of tie Income Tax Act, the
Criminal Code and Prison Reform, an improved
pension plan for the Royal Canadian Mounted
Police, and the creation of a Hydro Electrie
Power Commission in the Northwest Territories.
Members of the House of Commons:
I thank you for the provision you have made
for all essential services.
You will be gratified that an unprecedented
surplus of revenues over expenditures has made
possible considerable reductions both in the
national debt and in taxation. The sales tax
on virtually all types of food lias been removed.
A further exemption in personal income taxes
has been granted for persons over sixty-five
years of age. Estates up to a value of $50,000
have been freed of Dominion succession duties.
Ilonourable Members of the Senate:
Members of the House of Commons:
On July 1, the Post Office Department will
inaugurate, at ordinary first-class rates, an airmail service which, as respects the delivery of
letters, will, under normal conditions, reduce
the distance fron one end of Canada to the
other to less than twenty-four hours.
As you are aware, floods in the Fraser
Valley of British Columbia recently reached
the proportions of a national disaster. In
coping with the appalling situation thereby
created, there lias been the closest co-operation
between the federal government and the provincial and local authorities. I should like to
express my appreciation of the prompt and
effective measures taken by the armed services.
the civil authorities, and the citizens of the
province in meeting the emergency. I should
like also to thank you for the financial provision you have made to assist in relief and
rehabilitation, and in the constructive work of
repairing the dikes.
The approval given by both houses of parliament to a planned development of the national
capital, and the provision you have made for
necessary improvements, will belp to ensure
continuity in the eapital's development in a
manner whicli will have regard to its position
in the present, and to its probable needs in
years to come.
Today there is no country in a more fortunate position than our own; nor bas Canada.
at any time, enjoyed a higher place in the
May
regard of tise nations of the world.
Divine
Providence
continue
to bless our
country, and to guide the Parliament of Canada
in all its deliberations.
