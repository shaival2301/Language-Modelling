It is rny great picasure to greet you on thîs, the first day of

tbe Tbirty-fourtb Parliarnent since Confederation. This
ceremony is ricb in history, custorn, tradition and symbolisrn.
It is also a renewal of the vital relationship arnong Crown,
people, pariiarnent and goverrnent that, today as in the past,
is the essence of Canadian dernocracy.
Tbe people have spoken in a general election three weeks
ago. Their members in the House of Commons bave today
claimed frorn the Crown the ancient rights and privileges that
enabie thern to carry out their responsibilities.
In the election, rny government sought and received a
mandate for its poiicies, inciuding tbe Free Trade Agreernent

January i, 1989. Tbe purpose of tbis eariy session of the

reached the stage of Senate cornrittee study, prior to dissolution of tbe Tbirty-tbird Parliarnent.
My government is deterrnined to secure the benefits of
economic opportunity for this and future generations of
Canadians. This Agreernent reflects rny ministers' confidence
in Canada's abiiity to compete witb tbe best in the worid.

SPEECH FROM THE THRONE
ADDRESS IN REPLY-TERMINATION 0F DEBATE NO LATER
THAN EIGH-TH SITTING DAY

Hon. C. William Doody (Deputy Leader of the Govera-

ment): Honourable senators, with leave of the Senate and
notwithstanding rule 45(1 )(i), 1 move:
That the proceedings on the Order of the Day for
resuming the debate on the motion for an Address in
reply to Her Excellency the Governor General's Speech
from the Throne addressed to both Houses of Parliament
be concluded on the eighth sitting day on which the order
is debated.
The Hon. the Speaker: Is leave granted, honourable
senators?
Hon. Senators: Agreed.
Hon. Royce Frith (Deputy Leader of the Opposition): Honourable senatôrs, because of the unusual nature of the Speech
from the Throne, dealing as it does with just one subject,
should we not have the motion read "... be concluded no later
than the eighth sitting day .. "instead of "... on the eighth
sitting day. .? Surely. we can conclude the debate before
the eighth sitting day. It is quite a different matter with a
full-fledged Speech from the Throne where there are so many
subjects dealt with, but in this case 1 think we should modify it
to say ".... no later than the eighth sitting day .. .
Senator Doody: Honourable senators, 1 have no problem
with that, but it rcally does not matter if this sits on the order
paper for eight days and disappears or whether the terminology is changed now to make sure that the debate does not go
beyond eight sitting days. It is a matter of small concern to me
if senators wish to make that adjustment.
The Hon. the Speaker: Is it the wish of honourable senators

that 1modify the wording?
Hon. Senators: Agreed.
The Hon. the Speaker: The motion will now read:

be concluded no later than the eîghth sitting day on
which the order is debated.
...

Is it agreed, honourable senators?
Hon. Senators: Agreed.
Motion, as modified, agreed to.

Hon. C. William Doody (Deputy Leader of the Govern-

ment), with Ieave of the Senate and notwithstanding rule

QUESTION PERIOD
[English]
THE CABINET
PRINCE EDWARD ISLAND REPRESENTATION

Hon. M. Lorne Bonneli: Honourable senators, I have a

question for the Leader of the Government in the Senate.
Since the province of Prince Edward Island has gone Liberal
red, since that province is flot likely to be represented by any
cabinet ministerHon. C. William Doody (Deputy Leader of the Government): Bonneli for cabinet!
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear!
Senator Bonneli: -and keeping in mind that ail provinces
should be represented in cabinet, 1 should like to suggest to the
Leader of the Government that he suggest to the Prime
Minister that there are three excellent senators on the government side who represent Prince Edward Island, any one of
whom could represent that province well in the cabinet,
We have, for example, Senator Phillips, who is the Government Whip.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear!
Senator Steuart: This is known as the kiss of death!
Senator Bonneli: Senator Phillips was a member of Parliament for Prince County, the riding in which the fixed link was
supposed to have been built-and 1 might mention that those
who advocated that fixed link have ail faded into oblivionand 1 know that he would represent the government well. He
has answered questions in this chamber in the absence of the
Leader of the Government and the Deputy Leader of the
Government, and he could bring forth many good responses on
behalf of Prince Edward Island.
We also have Senator Macquarrie,-

December 13, 1988

December 13, 1988

SENATE DEBATES

SENATE DEBATES

Hon. Senators: Hear, hear!
Senator Bonneli: -one of the longest standing members of
the House of Commons. He bas been a member of Parliament
since 1957-and 1 might add that be lives very close to the site
of the proposed fixed link, at Victoria-and bas represented
that province well in the Government of Canada.
Then, since the Conservative Party was unable to elect a
lady in ail of Atlantic Canada, 1 must point out that we also
have Senator Rossiter.
Hon. Senators: Hear, bear!
Senator Bonnell: It is only nigbt, 1 tbink, that in the cabinet
there be female representation of Atlantic Canada. Perhaps
Senator Rossiter would be the one.
As far as we in Prince Edward Island are concerned,
honourable senators, we would be pleased if any one of those
three senators could be named to the cabinet of Canada to
represent our province. That would do it justice and it would
be much better served than it bas ever been over the past four
years.
Hon. LowelI Murray (Leader of the Government, Minister
of State for Federal-Provincial Relations and Acting Minister
of Communications): Honourable senators, first, I welcome
the belated recognition by Senator Bonnell of the great merits
of my colleagues from Prince Edward Island. We have taken
note of that. 1 bave also taken note of bis view that the election
results, so far as Prince Edward Island is concerned, constitute
a rejection of tbe fixed-link concept. 1 take it he is now
personally opposed to that, and it is interesting to have that
news on the record.
He will know tbat decisions regarding the composition of tbe
ministry are made by the Prime Minister and will be
announced by bim at tbe appropniate time. 1 do, bowever, have
to remind him that there were times under Liberal governments wben there was no representation in tbe cabinet from
Prince Edward Island, althougb tbere were members of the
House of Commons from that province. There were otber
times wben there were no Liberal members of the House of
Commons from Prince Edward Island, but Prime Minister
Pearson and Prime Minister Trudeau did not sec fit to appoint
Senator Bonnell or other senators from Prince Edward Island
to the cabinet. Indeed, if 1 recaîl correctly, Senator MacEacben from Nova Scotia, then a member of the House of
Commons-and Mr. Jamieson at another time-had the nesponsibility of representing Prince Edward Island's interests in
the cabinet.
Senator Petten: And they represented Prince Edward Island
well.
Hon. Orville H. Phillips: 1 sbould like to ask a supplementary question to that of Senator Bonnell. Senaton Bonnell
stated that be is opposed to the fixed link. 1 would ask the
Leader of the Govennment in the Senate if the Premier of
Prince Edward Island bas informed bim whetber or not be is
also opposing tbe fixed link.
Senator Murray: Not recently, honourable senatons.

Senator Bonnell: Honourable senators, 1 have a supplementary question. First, ]et me state that 1 do not think that the
Premier of Prince Edward Island bas ever said he is opposed to
the fixed link. Therefore, the words '*not recently" give a
wrong impression.
Secondly, 1 would like to suggest that 1have neyer said that
1 am opposed to the fixed link. Therefore, that is another
wrong impression. The Conservative Party Iost its four seats in
Prince Edward Island by giving wrong impressions.
Honourable senators, if there is to be a fixed Iink, we want
to ensure that the environment is protected. We do not want
the environment of our province destroyed. We want an environmental study, and we want the people to be informed. We
do not want anything underhanded. That is our rationale, and
that is wby we think any one of those tbree senators would
protect us and look after our rights. Tbey know our Island;
they know our people; and they would do a good job.

SPEECH FROM THE THRONE
MOTION FO R ADDRESS IN REPLY-DEBATE ADJOURNED

Tbe Senate proceeded to consideration of Her Excellency
the Governor General's Speech at the opening of the session.
Hon. Solange Chaput-Rollani, seconded by Honourable
Richard J1.
Doyle, moved:
That the following Address be presented to Her Excellency the Governor General of Canada:
To Her Excellency the Rigbt Honourable Jeanne
Sauvé, a Member of the Queen's Privy Council for
Canada, Chancellor and Principal Companion of the
Order of Canada, Chancellor and Commander of the
Order of Military Merit upon wbom bas been conferred
the Canadian Forces's Decoration, Governor General and
Commander-in-Chief of Canada.
May it please Your Excellency:
We, Her Majesty's most loyal and dutiful subjects, the
Senate of Canada in Parliament assembled, beg leave to
offer our humble tbanks to Your Excellency for the
gracious Speech whicb Your Excellency bas addressed to
botb Houses of Parliament.
She said: Honourable senators, Mr. Speaker, 1do not know
if the rules of this bouse allow me to express to you my respect
and deference to your decisions, but our friendship of many
years prompts me to tel] you bow pleased 1 arn to sit in this
noble and historic chamber witb ail my colleagues, whatever
their political beliefs.
Honourable senators, nobody here or in the otber place
could be surprised by the bigbly serene royal speech or,
especially in the present circumnstances, its conciseness.
However, the very distinguished colleagues around me
would be surprised and probably quite taken aback if, in my
maiden speech in the Senate, despite the trepidation 1 feel, 1
took the liberty of offering a very detailed analysis of the

SENATE DEBATES
SENATE DEBATES
stricïly economic consequences of the Free Trade Agreement
between the United States and our country. Canadians of ail
regions, of ail opinions as well as of ail origins seem to have
undersiood better than mosi of our experts the democratic
qualities inhereni in this agreement. 0f aIl our spiritual,
intellectual and national resources, Canadian democracy that
bas inspired American democracy and has been inspired by it
is undoubtedly one of the most highly respected realities
throughout the world.
The clauses of the Free Trade Agreement and the appeal
tribunal thaï will decide on ils orientations or perhaps ils
exaggerations are living proof of the open-mindedness between
Canada and the United States.
[English]
The free trade negotiations may have been more arduous
beïween those who set the rules for their respective countries
than we suspect, but îhey have been, on another level, a model
of friendship which bas flot passed unnoïiced in far away
counîries that will be linked together in 1992 by a common
market between nations and people who, in the pasi, have been
more often enemies than friends.

irrefutable evidence that if the peoples of the earth wanted to
reach agreements as we did with the United States, they could.
Canada is a prime example of a democracy that is based
more on people's spiritual than material interests.
Honourable senators, let me say aloud that 1 did flot come to
the Senate to support those who for partisan reasons want to
abolish or radically transform our parliamentary system. To bc
sure, 1, like many others, reserve the right, if you allow me,
one day to make some suggestions that 1 have accumulated
during my career. At a trne of free trade with our neighbours,
proïecïing what distinguishes our institutions from theirs
seems to me to be a supreme imperative for the vitality of our
national identities.
The more we weaken our British traditions to which we are
ail attached, francophones, English-speaking people or those
from any other country who have come to live with us, the
more we model them on those created by the great American
people, the faster, perhaps, we wiIl disappear into our neighbours' melîing pot. Honourable senators, alïhough 1 am flot
naïve enough ai my age
[Englishj
10 believe and say that Meech Lake and free trade are of the
same cement, 1 see both of these accords as conducive to a
stronger Canada, because 1 cannot, and will not, accept the
belief thaï our country and our central goverfiment mighï be
weakened by the strength of our regions. Those who assert
such false statements are precisely those who want a strong
country at the expense of weak regions.
[Translation]
Honourable senators, 1 did flot accept the invitation to sit

to sit and sleep on things 1 wanî to tell you but to stand on the
principles in which 1 have believed for the last 35 years. 1 do
flot inîend to impose my will on others-and why should 1? 1
also do flot intend to display disrespect for the majority of

when a majority of non-elected members believes thaï it has

SENATE DEBATES

SENATE DEBATES

My loyaity to Canada also reflects the ioyalty wbîcb
Canada bas for Quebec, the land to wbich 1 owe everything 1
arn. Honourable senators, 1 must confess tbough that as a
francophone Quebecer, 1 bave often wondered over the past
forty years if Canada reaily considered me as a first class
citizen, especiaily after its refusai to honour the promises made
during the 1980 Referendum. The day wiii come wben those of
us wbo fougbt for the "no" tbrough speecbes in some 45
Quebec towns wiIl bave to clearly express our disappointment
witb regard to the aftermatb of the referendum. But tbis is not
the time to do so. i wouid overtax your patience and my
ignorance of your rules if 1 were to venture into sucb dangerous ground.
But after tbe elections sbowed tbe interests of citizens are
reflected in tbe Rigbt Honourable Brian Muironey's Canadian
beliefs, 1 arn stili more deeply convinced than before of free
trade's and Meech Lake's advantages for a country that is just
starting to benefit from the positive efforts and exceptional
performances of the Conservative government in finally institutionalizing and constitutionaiizing the national reconcîliation.
Honourable senators, 1 wouid like, if i may, to suggest tbat 1
wiil be neither too submissive nor too insubordinate to the
ruies of tbis place. 1 wiil use ail the energy stiil left in me to
support the efforts of members of this house wbo, iike myself,
wii want to restore the peopie's confidence in this institution
whose prime goal bas aiways been profound individual reflection and overail serenity, witb partisansbip and confrontation
being its last goal.
As an aside, let met tell you that for more than 35 years 1
bave been living at the heart of communications, being a
journalist. 1 know ibis is not a very popular title, but just iike
you i arn proud of my profession. Just like you, 1 arn proud of
the opportunity it gave me to meet hundreds of thousands of
Canadians from sea to sea, to speak to tbem, to iisten to them
and to try to understand them from the bottom of my soul. To
me, honourable senators, Canada's map is not sîmpiy a drawing in history text-books but rather faces, smiles, people wbo
are burting and searching; people who are tired of our in-fighting, who are asking us to soive their problems rather than
adding new poiitical problems to their own daiiy problems. 1
take the liberty to say so because rather than the thought of a
new senator much too inexperienced to give iessons to anyone,
this is primarily the product of 35 years of reflection, meetings, travelling through ail provinces, ail areas and most cities
and villages of my country.
Honourabie senators, i feei that our feliow citizens more
and more need a haven of peace, islands of social and cultural
security. In the coming montbs, despite a cicar-cut victory, we
wiil together go through difficult moments in the aftermath of
tbe free-trade debate, of the efforts of those who openly seek to
sabotage the Meech Lake Agreement and who do flot care
whether Quebec remains outside Canada. 0f course, we are ail
anxiously awaiting the judgment which wili be rendered this
coming Thursday by the Supreme Court whose wisdom and
profundity we do not doubt. Tbis is why we will have to stick

together and provide our feliow citizens with the opportunity
they are asking for.
As tbe great author François Mauriac once put it, "The
people do not aiways know wbat theyý want, but tbey bave a
gut knowiedge of what tbey do flot want".
If need be, the peoples in Canada can accept poiitical
debates-the ramps to freedom of speech-but deep down
tbey expect answers to their problems from their seniors,
meaning by that most of us bere in this house. Thus we have a
duty to provide them witbout partisanship, in ail friendliness,
witb the benefit of the experiences gone through by eacb of us
who like myseif have white hair. We bave lived, won, lost,
loved, suffered-tbere are tbîngs we know. One of those tbings
is that even if our experience is flot requested, bonourable
senators, it is stili of great value. This is why I would like that
in this bouse we be[English]
a group of individuals capable flot oniy of a second sober
tbought but aiso of a third, a fourtb, a fiftb or even a tenth
sober thought-but neyer a first somber tbougbt.
[Translation]
Honourabie senators, you have been more than patient with
me and I want to tbank you.
Hoa. Senators: Hear, hear!
[English]
Hon. Richard J. Doyle: Honourabie senators, our colleague,
Madame Cbaput-Roliand, said that she was suffering; from
stage fright. 1hesitate to think how forceful she might be when
she is flot. I amn, indeed, indebted to my coileague for a
splendid statement on the motion for an Address in reply to
the Speech fromn the Tbrone which is before the bouse.
However, it is my understanding that it is somewbat traditionai for senators responding to the Speech fromn the Throne
to say something of the region they represent in ibis chamber.
It is an honour for me, i can assure you, to bring greetings
from the splendid Province of OntarioSoine Hoa. Senators: Hear, bear!
Senator Doyle: -which, with customary modesty, hesitates
to describe its endowments from the Aimigbty or the embroidery work that man and successive goverfiments in Ottawa
have done to those endowments. Indeed, the only doubt of the
day might weil be: -Wiil success spoil Ontario?"
i can put that proposition best by noting that no province of
the Dominion and very few states of the Union face equai
problims of garbage and waste disposai. Is our progress to be
impeded by the vast quantity and unspeakable quality of what
we throw away?
It is a fact that there are fewer unempioyed in my province
than the national average and even fewer in the city of my
birth. Wili that success spoil Toronto, where prosperity
attracts the jobiess from all parts of the country and every part
of the world where men and women see migration as the only
guarantee of a better future for their chiidren?

SENATE DEBATES

SENATE DEBATES
*(1030)

So the airports are choked, the road systems are inadequate
for the rushes and the apartment vacancy rate shrinks to haif
of 1 per cent. Being hooked on drugs is one escape from the
tensions. Ontario wrestles with the diiemma that the riches of
the cities and of the prime agricuiturai lands are spread very
thin in the regions, particuiarly in the north, where miners and
lumbermen extracted the bounty that originaily fuelled much
of the prosperity of the south.
It is aIl very well to build an opera house and a domed
stadium to signal the success of Ontario. However, to face up
to the issues that thrcaten to spoil it ail is what must be donc
by the legislature that directs the future of this province.
The role that the Government of Canada must play in
easing the difficulties of my province is not inconsiderable. The
heaith and prosperity of Canada as a whoie depend, to a great
degree, on the continuing success of Ontario. That prospcrity
has just been cntrusted for another four years to the Progressive Conservative government.
A previous Prime Minister, Mr. Pierre Trudeau, was given
to reminding Canadians, when they were critical of his policies, that the only way they could change them was with their
vote at the next election. 1 would flot subscribe to the proposition that the ballot box is the only vehicle for effective
expression of dissent; nor would 1 expect any member of this
chamber to champion that thesis. Indeed, in its first mandate-the greatest ever given to a government of this country-Progressive Conservatives demonstrated a wiliingness to
listen to and to act upon the response of the people to
government initiatives.
Was that flot the case with free trade with the United
States, which had flot been advocated in 1984 but which was
found to be the wiser course when our great neighbour to the
south entered upon a protectionist course in 1985? It was that
year, honourabie senators, that this chamber chose to participate in the joint parliamnentary committee which held public
hearings on free trade across this country. From Halifax to
Vancouver, under the chairmanship of Mr. Tom Hockin and
Senators Flynn and Simard, we listened to the briefs of
businessmen, union members and consumer advocates. We
came back to Ottawa, after an exciting summer of listening
and arguing, and we prepared our report to Parliamrent. We
urged that the Prime Minister immediately undertake the
steps that wouid lead to a treaty that wouid produce freer
trade between the United States and Canada. Both Liberal
and Conservative members signed that report. When that
treaty was agreed upon, it went to the Foreign Affairs Comnmittee of this chamber and, at the end of six months, the
chairman, Senator van Roggen, in an article of praise in The
FinancialPosi, described the agreement as salutary.
The opposition insisted, and the Liberals in the Senate mnade
certain, that the free trade issue was unresolved when the
election was calied. It was a use of Senate power beyond the
reasonable purposes of this place. At least, that is my opinion
and the opinion of many Canadians from whom more will be
heard whcn the Mcech Lake Accord has been ratîfied and
[SenalorD.sIc

I

Senate reform cornes to the agenda of the First Ministers, as it
most certainly shall in this new mandate.
But in the meantime free trade was the most discussed of ail
the issues before the Canadian people in the 1988 election.
That hallot was not a one-issue referendum; in the end it had
much to do with which party the people believed was best
fitted to deal with the management of this country in the next
four years. The management record of the Conservatives in the
last four years, as the opposition kept reminding us, was
another vital factor in the decision-making process.
As many of my colleagues on both sides of this chambercolleagues who involved themselves in the campaîgn-«can
testify, there were questions asked on many matters, although
we were neyer too far away from things reiated to free trade.
it was my privilege to spcak at several campaign gatherings
in Ontario, including those held at homes for senior citizens.
At one meeting 1 was introduced as a "real, live senator". 1
wilI tell honourable senators, as 1 told the audience, that the
description was a compliment that would please any member
of this chamber. To be realistic and to be lively was implied,
and what more could a senator ask?
At the same meeting a woman in a wheelchair, who had a
formidable visage and a firm voice, told us that she was tired
of hearing ail the nonsense about people in the homes and how
they were worried"sick about losing their pensions and their
medical aid. "I'd be concerned", she said, "if 1 thought there
was any truth in that, but what I'm really worried about is
what's going to happen to my grandchiidren, and nobody's
taiking about that!" 1 shouid not have been surprised. Most
older people 1 know are not selrish; they are concerned that the
generations that foilow them will bc spared the trials they
faced and will be open to opportunities they did flot know. The
woman who spoke up couid accept free trade and rewards that
might flot be fuily realized for ten years. She could accept that
by voting for a candidate who seemed best equipped by record
and by intent to provide prudent management of her country.
Matters of such consequence are flot settled by piebiscites.
i was reminded, honourable senators, of lines from the
report of the commission which Mr. Trudeau appointed to look
into the economy. H-onourable senators will remember that
that commission was headed by Donald Macdonald, the
former finance minister who, three years ago, told us:
Protective barriers may seem on the surface to offer a
measure of security in an uncertain environment. We
must also recognize them, however, as unmistakable
confessions of weakness. IJntii these barriers are gone, the
exhilaration that can come from a truc sense of maturity
will remnain beyond our reach.
How 1 have wished that those words had been on the tip of my
tongue that morning in the senior citizens' home!
Yesterday, in the Speech from the Throne, Her Exceliency
noted that the people had spoken in an election and that we
wouid be moving in this session to impiement the free trade
legislation s0 that it might be in place on January i, as

SENATE DEBATES

scheduled. That will secure the benefits which the agreemnent
provides.
It is encauraging ta me ta note that in statements ta the
press senators on both sides ai this chamber have indicated
their intention ta deal wîth this histarîc business with dispatch.
Later, as the Gavernar General indicated, there will bc
another Speech from the Throne, at which tirne the gavernment will set forth its agenda for the days ahead. It is then
that we rnight anticipate legislation dealing with child care
and broadcasting and with new initiatives for Parliament's
consideration. It was here that Her Excellency spoke ai the
renewal which is the essence ai Canadian dernacracy. For
..real, live senatars" renewal is an invigarating challenge.
Hanourable senators, it is well that we dwell an the bright
promise a new session brîngs ta these precincts. The rnood ai
aptimism is heightened, tao, by the iact that we are together
again on the eve ai the holiday season when differences ai
outlook and persuasion are dimmed by the sharing ai traditions, beliefs and hopes.
Yet it is impossible ta ponder aur awn goad fortune without
acknowledging that ail pleasure is clouded by the great tragedy whic'h has befallen the people ai Armenia. Last week's
earthquake was one ai the greatest disasters ai our history. It
is almast impossible for us ta conceive ai lass ai lufe on such a
scale or damage ta praperty sa extensive.
Frarn ail parts ai this cynical world ai ours aid is pauring in
ta the crushed and rubbled cities-Spitak, Leninakan, Kirovakan and Stepanavan-places that rnost ai us had scarcely
heard ai a week aga. Our governrnent has committed S550,000
in relief and has prornised $5 million mare. Mr. Clark has
offered expertise in clearing the ruins leit by the quake. Help
fromn Canadian arganizations and indivîduals has been swift
and generaus.
But how littie it seems ta thase wha give. Whatever, it goes
with prayers for rescue and recovery and with understanding
ai the special grief ai Armenian Canadians.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear!
On motion ai Senatar Gigantès, debate adjourned.
PRIVILEGE

Hon. H.A. Oison: Honourable senators, I should like ta
raise a question ai privilege. My question ai privilege has ta do
with the action that has been taken by the members ai this
chamber, in an unusual sitting-in that the Senate met at ten
o'clock this marning-ta do away with the sittings for the rest
ai the week, and the main reason for my rising is that this
action aiso washes out ail ai the Question Periods for this
week.
Honaurable senatars know full well that we have not had a
chance ta get at the government for aver three rnonths ta ask
questions that we have an obligation ta ask and that the
gavernrnent has an obligation ta answer. 1 wanted ta raise a
number ai questions about the rescue tearn that is being held
up at Mirabel Airpart in Quebec, which has been trying ta get

over ta Armenia ta be of assistance. It is comprised ai trained
people from western Canada who have carried out this sort of
operatian before, and the government did nat give themt the
kind ai clearance they needed in order ta be part ai tbat rescue
operation. wbich the whole warld reàlizes is sa desperately
needed. 1 wanted ta raise questions about Canada's failure ta
respond ta the speech made by Chairman Garbachev at the
U.N. a iew days aga. 1 wanted ta raise questions about the
GATT meeting and the absolute failure ai Canada ta do
anything positive respecting the agricultural problems that
were braught up there.
*(1040)
1 know what happens. You ask a question and the Leader ai
the Government, who is responsible for giving or abtaining the
answer, takes the question as notice, and sometimes you get an
answer a iew days later. Anyway, he has an obligation ta carry
such questions ta the ministers who are responsible and ta
corne back with answers. Naw that is not going ta happen.
1 say ta you, hanourable senators, that it is an irresponsible
act on the part of this chamber ta meet for ane short Question
Periad and then adjourn for a week, when we have ail thase
matters in which the Canadian people are interested, in which
they are desperately interested in same cases, and naw we do
not even have a chance ta get at the gavernment.
Senator Flynn: You have a chance now!
Senator Oison: 1 understand that, but when you were sitting
on this side of the house yau had an obligation ta ask the
questions; and we accepted aur obligation when we sat over
there ta provide answers ta them. That daes nat happen
anymare, and 1 arn getting fed up with the way this gavernment respands ta its public responsibility..
Senator Flynn: That is not a question ai privilege!

Senator Oison: It is a question ai privilegeSenator Flynn: No!
Senator Oison: -because we are changing the rules ai this
house. Normally, we meet at twa o'clock. 1 had an appointment at the hospital at ten o'clock this rnarning se, after you
changed the hour of sitting, 1 was unable ta be here.
Some Hon. Senators: Oh, oh!
Senator Oison: 1 don't like it, and it is wrang in my view. 1
know my colleagues agreed ta sitting at 10 a.r.-l was nat at
that meeting either-but 1 abject ta the Senate's abdicating its
responsibility ta pravide an opportunity for members ai the
opposition ta ask questions and ta oblige the Leader ai the
Gavernment ta seek answers ta them.
1 know that yau are going ta go through the process. You
have leave ta adjourn a little later until next Tuesday, but 1
give notice now that there is not gaing ta be unanimous
consent any more for this chamber ta abdicate its responsibility and adjourn sa that we wash out Question Periods.
Senator Flynn: We had one when you were not here!

SENATE DEBATES

realiy do flot know what got him so excited this morning. 1
hope that his trip to the hospital was flot in any waySenator Oison: If you understand plain Engiish, you might
have heard what 1 just said! 1 want sorne Question Periods.
Senator Doody: 1 heard the honourable senator say that he
was upset because he did not get to Question Period this
morning.
Senator Oison: Yes, and now there wili be no Question
Period tomorrow.
Senator Doody: 1 arn sorry about that. 1 regret very much
that happening, but the major thrust of his complaint appears
to be one of not having communication with his caucus. 1 had
no probiemn at ail in discussing this matter in our caucus, and
the people on this side agreed that this was the procedure we
would adopt. My understanding was that the people on the
other side did exactiy the same thing.
If Senator Oison did flot communicate with his people or did
flot have them communicate with him, then 1 arn sorry about
that, but there is nothing 1 can do about it. If there are enough
senators here who want to corne back tomorrow, or this
evening, or this afternoon, or any timne that is convenient for
them, then certainly we are prepared to do exactiy that. There
is no desire to cut off Question Period and there is no desire to
deprive the honourabié gentleman of aIl the information he
needs about these matters of tremendous import that he has
raised, and we wiii see that he gets the information as soon as
the Senate is prepared to sit and discuss them.

THE HONOURABLE IAN SINCLAIR
TRIBIJTES ON RETIREMENT FROM THE SENATE

Hon. Allan J. MacEachen (Leader of the Opposition):
Honaurable senators, 1 should like to draw your attention to
the fact that our colleague, the Hanourable lan Sinclair, bas

reached that time in bis career when he can no longer remain a
member of the Senate of Canada. In fact, Ian Sinclair will
reach that magic moment on December 27 next. Howevcr,
because this is the last day he will spend witb us in the Senate,
I thought 1 ought to risc and say something about bis remarkable career, flot only as a lawyer and a businessman but also as
a parliamentarian in the ive years that he has spent as a
member of this chamber.
It is unnecessary for me to review in detail Senator Sinclair's career, except to say that, initially, he made bis reputation as a solicitor in the legal department of the Canadian
Pacific Railway. During that period he gained great experience in making presentations and arguments on behalf of the
railway before sucb notable commissions as the Kellock Royal
Commission and the MacPherson Royal Commission on
Transportation. In fact, he became known as the "Perry
Mason" of railway law.
That career as a lawyer subsequently led to even higher
respansibilities when, in 1966, he became president of the
CPR. During bis leadership of that organization it was transformed from a single operation to an important Canadian
conglomerate. The name "Sinclair" became synonymous with
the CPR. In fact, it is said that many people believed that be
owned the CPR. Probably he behaved as if he owned it.
Senator Sinclair was a realist in those days. He knew-in
much the same way as we ail] know about the Senate-that the
CPR was not really loved. He said that he worked desperately
ta secure respect for the CPR even if he could flot win the love
of the Canadian people for that institution. Honourable senators, he bas taken somewhat the same attitude since he bas
came to the Senate. He knows that the Senate, too, is flot the
most loved institution in Canada, but he bas worked very hard
ta increase respect among the Canadian people for the Canadian Senate.
I believe that by bis participation in the law, in business and
in various public service activities Ian Sinclair was well prepared to become an active contributor ta the Canadian Senate.
For example, in 1982 he took on the onerous task of heading
up the restraint program called the "six-and-five pragram".
During his undertaking of that task be exercised aIl of bis

persuasive ability in informing not only the business community and tbe labour unions but also citizens in general of the
nccessity for taking action to restrain price increases.
Honourable senators, anc might have expected that Ian
Sinclair, in coming to tbe Senate, would regard the work of
this chamber as baving a low priority among bis many responsibilities and the many urgent dcmands made upon his time.
Quite tbe contrary; the Senatc became one of bis chief prioritics. He performcd bis work as a member of the Standing
Senate Committec on Banking, Trade and Commerce with
great care; subscqucntly, as chairman of the committec, be
maintained the higb standard of operations of that committee
that had been set by bis illustriaus predecessors.
It may bave surpriscd some people that, as a member of that

committee, he would become an investigator of the pricing
habits of the multinational pharmaccutical industry, but that,
indeed, is wbat bappencd. This business tycoon adapted casily
to the necessity of ensuring, to the best of bis ability, that the
interests of the Canadian people were protectcd. In a sense, be
transformed the concept of the Senate as a place of special
privîlege. Those wbo knew Ian Sinclair were nat surprised that
be would take on a role of that kind. Former Canadian Pacific
Chairman Fred Burbidge statcd that Ian -genuinely enjoyed
doing things ... If there wasn't a crisis going, he'd create onc.

Partly out of fun, partly from a desire for the resolution of an
issue."
It must be said that Ian Sinclair rcally bas enjoyed the
Senate. Certainly, he enjoyed tbat first caper, if I may caîl it
that, that attracted so much attention at the time, but that was
small in and of itself-namnely, holding up the borrowing bill
until the Main Estimates were tabled. Today that caper looks
like a small incident, but in the period in which it occurred it
was regarded as somewhat of a parliamentary crisis. So ail I
can say at this moment ta Senator Sinclair and his colleagues
is that he bas been a tower of strength as a member of the
Canadian Senate.
Senator Perrault: Hear, bear!
Senator MacEachen: He has been a doer. He bas insisted an
making a contribution and, despite ail the other dcmands on
his time, bas been able ta give a high priority ta the work of
the Canadian Senate.
I regret very much indecd that Senator Sinclair will no
longer be anc of my colleagues. However, I hope that be will
drap around naw and then ta the committce meetings so that
the next time we need a crisis we may caîl Senator Sinclair as
an important witness ta give it that atmospbere which be
enjoys s0 much.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear!

SENATE DEBATES

SENATE DEBATES

Hon. Lowell Murray (Leader of the Goverument, Minister
of State for Federal-Provincial- Relations and Acting Minister
of Communications): Honourable senators, 1want to thank tbe
Honourable Leader of the Opposition for having drawn our
attention to the departure, soon, of our esteemed colleague,
Senator lan Sinclair. 1 arn sure that Senator MacEachen
would flot expcî me and my colleagues on this side of the
chamber to share his entbusiasm for ail of Senator Sinclair's
senatorial initiatives or for aIl of the precedents be set while a
member of this chamber and a member of its varions committees, but I do agree that be embarked on them ail and saw
them througb with enormous energy, enthusiasm and dedication and, really, witb incomparable skill and eloquence.
* (2010)

Senator MacEachen bas alluded to the fact that our friend,
Senator Sinclair, bas had, in succession-contemporaneously,
really-three careers: one in the law; one as a business executive; and another as a parliamentarian. It is bis career as a
parliamentarian that is now drawing to a close. Wbile be is flot
as active as be once was in bis profession and in business, stili,
wberever intellect and strength of cbaracter and conviction are
respected in tbis country or anywbere else, Ian Sinclair is
certainly a force to be reckoned with.
Senator MacEachen bas referred to Senator Sinclair's early
career, wben I believe as a native'of Manitoba be took law and
later Iectured in the subject aI universiîy, and to bis distinguisbed career in business, in particular witb Canadian
Pacific.
I should note tbat our colleague was made an Officer of tbe
Order of Canada in 1979 and that we bave bad bim bere as a
colleague since 1983. During tbe past five years be bas proven
himself Io be a very spirited debater--certainly, be rarely
shrank from argument. I noticed a quotation attributed 10 bim
a couple of years ago in wbicb be is alleged to have said:
"Guys like Ian Sinclair don't back off. I mean, we press." I
must say we have seen that cbaracteristic demonstrated not
once but many times during Senator Sinclair's senatorial
career. It was the melancboly lot of Senator Finlay MacDonald 10 serve as deputy chairman of the Standing Senate
Committee on Banking, Trade and Commerce under Senator
Sinclair's cbairmansbip, and, wbile bis spirit is flot completely
broken by the experience, he does bave scars to show for itand he may reveal some of them tonight before we finish tbis
brief exchange.
I must say that my own experience witb Senator Sinclair,
when I was chairman of the Standing Senate Committee on
Banking, Trade and Commerce and be was deputy chairman,
was totally different. One could flot bave asked for a more
"docile", cooperative colleague. Future generations who may
want to read Hansardsbould note that tbese tbings are being
said somewbat in jest and in good humour, especially since
Senator Sinclair is going to bave tbe last word! Certainly. the
word "docile" in reference to Senator Sinclair is bardly justiied at any time. He bas been a most robust debater and a very
effective participant in the work of tbis chamber.

Honourable senators, on bebaîf of my coîleagues on Ibis side
and, indeed, on bebaîf of the Prime Minister and the goverfiment, I do want to wisb Senator Sinclair the best. I want to
express our appreciation tbat bis contribution to parliamentary
debate and to the parliamentary process bas been of tbe
bigbest quality, as have been his contributions to the professional life and business life of tbe country. So we say, *'au
revoir" and "bonne chance" to an esteemed and respected
colleague.
Hon. Senators: Hear, bear!
Hon. Finlay MacDonald: Honourable senators, over the last
number of years I have corne to dislike these occasions, but, if
tbe purpose of this exercise is to usher Senator Sinclair into a
life of affluent obscurity, I should like to tell you that I wish 10
participate witb great enthusiasm. If tbis is the last spike, I
sbould like to heîp drive it.
Senator Cools: Dream on!
Senator MacDonald: I wish to tell bonourable senators that
in the few years during wbicb I bad the pleasure of serving as
deputy chairman to Senator Sinclair my main task was 10
comfort and to apologize to the many witnesses wbo appeared
before Senator Sinclair, witnesses whose spirit and almost
physical condition were broken as a result of facing the
senator.
There is a book-I tbink you pay $25 for il and I tbink
Senator Sinclair bas bougbt most of tbe copies--called Lords
of the LUne in whicb there is a chapter called "Tbe Buccaneer", and that is Senator Sinclair.
I must say that be was a great teacber. I found bim to be a
rather rough individual, sometimes tending to the obscene. I
think tbat in another life be should have been a Supreme
Court judge, because wben be grabbed sometbing be grabbed
il like a bulldog and would neyer let it go. He was borribly
frustrating to work for, but extremely fair and always straigbt.
As for those of us who worked on committees witb him, even
though we disagreed on a number of occasions we neyer had
reason to question bis integrity or the truth that he sougbt.
I remember that on one particular occasion be gave a group
of union members the roughest lime I bad ever seen given to a
group of witnesses, at the end of wbîcb I said 10 them,
"Gentlemen, you have to understand that what the chairman
is seeking here is the trutb." They were worried about job
security. It was a privatization bill and they were worried, of
course, about their future. I said, prophetically, "You might be
pleasantly surprised by wbat Ibis committee finally comnes up
with under the clear influence of the chairman." Indeed, one
of those men wrote 10 me afterwards and said, 'We would not
have believed it." AIl tbat Senator Sinclair was seeking from
tbem, in a very difficult period of questioning, was 10 know
what they wanted, wby tbey wanted it, and why they felt tbat
they deserved il. Tbe committee report gave tbem just wbat
they were asking for.
I considered it a great pleasure to work witb Senator
Sinclair.

SENATE DEBATES

SENATE DEBATES
It was an experience, Ian, which I shall never forget. I
enjoyed it enormously and I enjoyed our personal friendship,
particularly after committee meetings when we might get
together and have some "warm milk" and-

Senator Cools: -cookies.
Senator MacDonald: -- discuss the day's activities.
I only wish to say, however, since Senator Sinclair will now
be going home for lunch, that I wish to extend my sincere
sympathies to his wife.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear!
Hon. Sidney L. Buckwold: Honourable senators, it has been
my privilege to be the third party of the steering committee of
the Standing Senate Committee on Banking, Trade and Commerce; as such, I was somewhat of a go-between for Senator
Sinclair and his deputy, Senator MacDonald, on the occasions
we met to discuss our programs and our decisions.
I am not sure whether the decisions ever emanated from the
the steering committee on the occasions that it met. We had a
chairman who, like an engine, really did not need steering and
managed to stay on the tracks on that main line all the while.
I am sure many of my fellow citizens from Saskatchewan
will be astounded that anyone from that province would have a
good word to say about anyone connected with the Canadian
Pacific Railway. The CPR and the chartered banks are the
number one targets of everyone from that province, and that
remains the case to this very day.

e

(2020)

So far as Senator Sinclair is concerned, I think all honourable senators would agree that he has been an exemplary
Canadian who, in the careers that we have heard outlined this
evening, has shown a brilliance rarely exceeded by others in
the business world.
I enjoyed being a member of his committee. He ran that
committee in a unique way. Unlike the CPR, the meetings
always started on time and finished on time. When a meeting
was called for 9.30 a.m., at exactly 9.30 a.m. the chairman
called for order and the meeting got under way. That was true
whether anybody was there or not. It really did not matter to
the chairman.
Senator Sinclair could be a little rough on witnesses sometimes, as Senator MacDonald has said. I recall when the
Minister of Communications appeared before the committee; a
nice young lady, she appeared before the committee when it
was considering amendments to the Patent Act and the Copyright Act. She was given a very rough ride. I apologized to her,
as Senator MacDonald did, but I think that in the end she
recognized that the chairman was after the facts, and in the
conclusion of the committee's report she found that her concerns were well satisfied.
That is exactly the way the chairman operated. He was fair;
he was considerate in the end, though not always in the
beginning; he was truthful; and he always "said it like it was".
He did not hesitate to question witnesses on matters that
bothered him. I think we all respected him for that.
iSenator MacDonald.]

December 20, 1988

Decem ber 20, 1988

On behalf of the other members of the committee let me say
that we enjoyed our association with Senator Sinclair. Not
only was it a learning experience but it was a privilege to be a
member of his committee. He showed leadership and made a
great contribution to the Senate and to the country.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear!
Hon. John B. Stewart: Honourable senators, I have a special

reason for speaking because, as honourable senators know, I
have been Senator Sinclair's seatmate for the past few years.
Senator MacEachen said that Senator Sinclair's legal and
business experience prepared him well to be a member of the
Senate. That comment reminded me of an article that Philip
Givens, sometime mayor of Toronto and sometime member of
the House of Commons, wrote explaining why successful

businessmen are almost certain to be complete failures in
politics. As I recall, Givens said that businessmen are quite

unprepared for the adjustments and compromises that are
inevitably required in politics; that they are shocked that their
errors and bungles would be revealed to the public, things
which, in their private corporations, are kept quiet, secret and
clandestine; and that they are impatient with the slowness with

which the political mills operate. Givens laid it on. One could
conclude that it was evident that no businessman-certainly
no big businessman-would ever be a success in either the

House of Commons or the Senate.
One now would have to say that Senator Sinclair has shown
that at least once in a while the view stated by Givens is
incorrect. As Senator Sinclair's seatmate I can testify that he
has enjoyed his work in the Senate and has been vigorous in
his contribution to the country through the Senate. Often the
quiet, little conversations we have had here as seatmates
reminded me of the kind of chats that go on in school when the
teacher is not being too attentive. I must say that I found those
conversations stimulating and, at the same time, encouraging.
I want to say to you, honourable senators. that today I feel a
very special sense of loss. I want to thank Senator Sinclair for
the stimulation and the encouragement he has given me.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear!
Hon. Lorna Marsden: Honourable senators, Senator Sinclair is a legendary figure in this country and in our time, and
he was long before he came to this chamber. He is a person
about whom I had heard many powerful Canadians speak with
great awe, but I must say, from the perspective of a feminist
arriving in the Senate, that my expectations were not very
high. However, I was delighted to find that I was wrong about
that, because, in addition to his creative attitude towards this
chamber and towards his work as chairman of the Banking,
Trade and Commerce Committee, which I think has been an
inspiration to those of us who had the privilege of sitting on it,
to my delight and somewhat to my amazement, it became very
evident when dealing with the Privatization Bill that Senator
Sinclair understood absolutely the concerns of women and
women workers in this country, in that he not only ensured
that those questions were raised but vigorously pursued or
pressed the witnesses on that account. Those of us who are

SENATE DEBATES

Dleember 201 1988

concerned about these matters noted that wîtb delight and we
are very grateful ta bim.
1 was most interested in Senator MacDonald's comment
about Senator Sinclair's natural talent for the Supreme Court,
and witb that in mind 1 sbould like ta thank Senator Sinclair
and extend our best wisbes for bis next career.
Hon. Senators: Hear, bear!
Hou. Ian Sinclair- Colleagues: How sweet it is!
As someone bas said. tbis is tbe end ai my third career,
wbich 1 bave enjoyed, and 1 arn actively pursuing a fourtb ane.
1 bad ta make a few adjustments wben 1came bere; bowever, I
sbould like ta say ta my colleagues that, surprisingly, 1 am tbe
first persan ta bave among bis papers a congratulatory letter
from John Diefenbaker, wbicb 1 received wben 1 was appointcd the president of Canadian Paciic. Those af you wbo know
Jobn Diefenbaker's background know tbat it took a lot for bim
ta congratulate me on anytbing that bad ta do with Canadian
Pacific. 1 also bave among my papers a kind note from Mike
Wilson, wbam 1 bave known for many ycars; 1 tbink Canada
bas been blessed witb having bim in tbe position of responsibility tbat be has bad and continues ta have.
1 recaîl tbe many famed upsets ai Senator Flynn in tbis
chamber. Wben 1 wcnt ta scbool tbey told me cumulus clauds
did nat excecd 20,000 feet. Aiter. listening ta Senator Flynn it
occurred ta me tbat tbat was wrang, because be aiten went
beyond 20,000.

Senator Sinclair. But 1 neyer did-1 didn't knaw bow ta do
it as a democrat. But, bonaurable senators, wbat we did do was
ta arrive at a conclusion. At anc point, because ai somne
associations 1 bad, 1 could flot really take part in tbe cbairmansbip ai the cammittee as I wanted-to sa 1 went thraugb a
surrogate process involving Senator Kirby. Sameane mentioned ta me later tbat be bad neyer known that Senator Kirby
understood the Banking Committee so well until be beard bim
put questions before that committee, and 1 icît pretty good
about that.
Honourable senatars, we bave bad problems bere, bave we
not? And we bave bad those problems because the process
does not enable us efiectively ta do the job we bave belore us.
That process bas ta be cbanged. How it is gaing ta be cbanged
is in tbe hands of other people, ai course, but thase wbo bave
been appointed ta this chamber, in my view, bave been
appointed ta undertake a stewardship, witb ail the meaning
that tbat word canveys. Yet we cannot be stewards and we
cannot make the contributions that a steward sbould make
because ai the fact tbat we are an appointed body samewbat
out ai step witb the modemn process-and we have ta change
that iact! 1 hope that that will happen and that the very great
capabilitiçs tba't are in tbis cbamber will bc able ta be made
manifest in the future.
Tbank you sa rnucb for being kind ta me in the last five
years.,

*(2030)

1 came bere with the feeling tbat tbis institution was flot
appreciated. During the course ai my other careers 1 appeared
before committees of botb the House and tbe Senate. 1 always
feit tbat tbe Senate committees were better able ta understand
the problems wc were dealing witb. Howevcr, the public
generally bad a very poor vicw ai the Senate. 1 amn happy ta
say that 1 believe the Senate bas a duty ta carry out in the
legisiative pracess. 1 also tbink few people realize that tbc first
time aur National Finance Committee abjected ta the passing
ai an appropriations bill witbout the necessary preliminary
work a statistical analysis indicatcd that the Senate bad saved

honourable

Hon. H.A. Oison:' Honourable senators, 1 do not give my
consent to that motion. We have not met in this chamber for
over three months and 1 have a long Iist of questions to put to
the Leader of the Government in the Senate concerning some
matters that are of importance to the people 1 arn supposed to
represent here in the Senate. Last week, when we met in this
chamber, we had hardly any Question Period; in fact, it was
over by the time I arrived in the chamber. Therefore, since
Question Period is the only opportunity afforded to members
of the chamber for asking questions, 1 hope the minister is
prepared now for a lengthy Question Period, since 1 intend to
make some inquiries respecting crop insurance. drought payments and a great many other matters that are of vital
importance to the people 1 represent.
Hon. Loweil Murray <Leader of the Government, Minister
of State for Federal-Provincial Relations and Acting Minister
of Communications): Honourable senators, if 1 may, the effect
of the honourable senator's denying leave for this motion
would be that the Senate would return tomorrow. However, 1
would not want the honourable senator and his colleagues to
come back here under false pretences. Unfortunately, 1 wiIl
not be in the chamber tomorrow or Thursday since 1 have
government business to attend to. 1 think the honourable
senator wiIl appreciate that. Frankly, 1 had included in my
own plans the assumption that we would not be sitting beyond
tonight, and 1 regret that 1 wiII not be able to be present in this
chamber tomorrow or the next day.
Last week 1 took notice of some subject matters that were
raised by Senator Oison. 1 arn prepared to attempt to deal with
those and other questions he may wish to put to me this
evening and to make every effort to obtain replies as quickly as

December 20,1988

SENATE DEBATES

SENATE DEBATES

December 20, 1988

possible to any questions tbat 1 ar nfot able to reply to this
cvcning.
Senator Oison: Honourable senators, 1 can appreciate what
the minister has just said and, of course, 1can well understand
the futility of having Question Period witbout the minister's
being present. 1 know that in the absence of the Leader of the
Government tbe deputy leader very graciously takes questions
as notice and gîves undertakings to obtain replies, and that he
does so as soon as possible, although it sometimes takes a week
or a montb.
As 1 say, 1 can appreciate wbat the Leader of the Government bas said. 1 simply want to advise bim that, if 1 give leave
for the passage of the Deputy Leader of tbe Government's
motion, it wiIl be necessary to have a fairly lengtby Question
Period this evening, since 1 have many questions to ask. 1
appreciate bis undertakîng in advance to endeavour to obtain
answers to my questions.
However, before we continue with the motion 1 should like
to advise the Leader of the Govcrnmnent in the Senate tbat 1
bave a question or two respecting tbe use of the social insurance number, and if 1 do not receive satisfactory answers I
shahl be asking for leave to revert to Notices of Motions in
order to give notice of a motion respecting this matter. 1 may
say to the Honourable Leader of the Government in the
Senate that the recent extended use of tbis number is disturbing a great number of Canadians.
Witb those comments 1 withdraw my objection to the
deputy leader's motion.
The Hon. the Speaker: It is moved by the Honourable
Senator Doody. seconded by the Honourable Senator Tremblay, witb Icave of tbe Senate and notwîthstanding rule
45(1 )(g):
That wben tbe Senate adjourns today, it do stand
adjourned until Tuesday next, 27tb December 1988, at
two o'clock in the afternoon.
Is it your pleasure, bonourable senators, to adopt the
motion?
Hon. Senators: Agreed.
Motion agreed to.

QUESTION PERIOD
[Engi:sh]
SOCIAL INSURANCE
ABUSE 0F SIN-GOVERN MENT ACTION

Hon. H.A. Oison: Honourable senators, 1 sbould like to ask
the Leader of the Government in the Senate whether the
goverfiment intcnds to make good on its undertaking, givcn in
a news relcase dated June 8, 1988, that it is the governmcnt's
intention to restrict the use of the social insurance number in
federal institutions. A short time aftcr that news relcase the

government introduced Bill C-139, wbîch expands very significantly the use of the social insurance number. Since that bill is
now law, it is now therefore an offence for both the seller and
the buyer of any interest-bearing financial instrument to fail to
notify the income tax collection -department of that
transaction.
1 want to know whether or not the minister will give an
undertaking tbat bc will diligently seek the remnoval of this
expandcd use of the SIN, since the news report put out by the
then Minister of Justice stated unequivocally that the government intended to restrîct the social insurance number to tbose
uses for which it was originally intended: namely, as an
identification number for tbe purposes of unemployment insurance and the Canada Pension Plan.
Hon. Lowell Murray (Leader of the Government, Minister
of State for Federal-Provincial Relations and Acting Minister
of Communications): Honourable senators, wbat 1 shaîl diligently do is direct the attention of my colleagues to the
inconsistency that the honourable senator perceives between
the action that the government took, on the one hand, and the
commitment that was made, on the other. Since 1do not know
enough about the matter at the moment 1cannot acknowledge
that there is any inconsistency. However, 1 shahl look into tbe
question raisedl by the honourable senator and report back very
quickly.
Senator Oison: Honourable senators, 1 have a supplementary question. Perhaps the Honourable Leader of the Government should also look at the undertakings that were sought by
one of the most illustriaus leaders of the Conservative Party,
the Right Honourable John Diefenbaker, when tbese identification numbers were first introduced in 1964. 1think there are
one or two things that need to be said about this matter. On
April 8, 1964, at page 1918 of House of Commons Debates,
Mr. Diefenbaker had this to say:
Mr. Diefenbaker: Mr. Speaker, would tbe minister give
an unequivocal answer that the information contained on
the forms used in this system, wbicb bears a strange
relationship to dictatorshipSome bon. Members: Oh, oh.
Mr. Diefenbaker: -will not bc made available in any
way, directly or indircctly, to any other department?
By tbe way, the minister who was answering at that time was
the Honourable Allan J. MacEachen, and he gave the right
answerSenator Perrault: Hear, hear!
Senator Oison: 1 might also say that he even had the
clairvoyance to sec that some governmcnt of the future migbt
perpetrate tbis terrible invasion of privacy.
Senator Murray: Well, he was a member of most of the
governments of the future.
Senator Oison: On the same page Mr. MacEachen is reportcd as saying:

SENATE DEBATES

SENATE DEBATES
Mr. MacEschen: 1 arn 'not in a position to indicate at
this stage what system of government record keeping will
bc involved in the future, but that is the present attitude
of the government.
Mr. Diefenbaker: Oh, income tax, and so on?
Mr. Pearson: Certainly flot.
0f course, Mr. Pearson was the Prime Minister at that time.
Mr. Diefenbaker: The Prime Minister is butting in. 1
ask him, will he give the undertaking on behalf of the
government that this information will flot be made available to other departments of government? We want to
know that this is flot a snooping operation for the use of
the government.
Soie hon. Members: Oh, oh.

Mr. Pearson: Mr. Speaker, the saine and, 1 would hope,
more effective precautions wiil be taken in this regard as
were taken under the regime of the right hon. gentleman.

SSenator Oison: Honourable senators, let.me ask what I hope
is my final question on this matter. The government has
brought in a bill. Before that bill was brought in it was flot an
offence to open a bank account or to buy guaranteed interestbearing certificates of any kind witb"out giving your social
insurance number, and the banks or the financial institutions
were flot obliged under the iaw to obtain that number.
A. Hon. Senator. Yes, they were.
Senator Oison: No, they were not. Not until that bill was
passed and given Royal Assent on September 13 did it become
an offence-an offence for both parties. That bill makes
matters worse. 1 have flot said that tbings were perfect before
that bill. 1 realize that there has been a steady encroachment.
As a matter of fact, in his report the Privacy Commissioner
has commented to the effect that there has been a tremendous
degradation of privacy in this country because of the government's use of the social insurance number.
This bill is an even worse insuit. Canadians can no longer
open bank accounts or buy financial instruments without
giving their number, whicb means that in many cases it will
show up in the income tax departmnent and, according to the
Privacy Commissioner, in about 1,500 private data banks in
this country. 1ask the minister to withdraw that provision.
Hon. Henry D. Hicks: Honourable senators, I have a supplementary question. Is the minister aware that when you
apply for a saîmon fishing licence, for example, in bis province
of New Brunswick, you are obliged to give your social insurance number?

Senator Murray: Honourable senators, I was flot aware of
that point either.
Senator Frith: The saimon are entitled to know!
Senator Nurgitz: It makes good sense to me.
Senator Murray: H-owever, I am aware that it frequently
happens that, when one goes into a place of business seeking to
conduct some business and does flot have other identification,
one is asked for one's social insurance number. It bappens aIl]
the time.
Senator Oison: But, until this bill, you were flot obliged by
Iaw to give it.
.Hon. Eyniard G. Corbin: Honourabie senators, 1 have a
supplementary question for the Leader of the Government in
the Senate. Is he aware that insurance companies are now
sending memos and notes to people tbey insure asking them for
their social insurance number? This is totaliy new. 1 received a
]etter from La Laurentienne, an insurance company witb
which 1 have been insured for years. For the first timne in my
life i was told by tbemn that under the law and the regulations 1
was obligated to suppiy them with my SIN. I dîd flot supply
the number. and 1 hope that people in this bouse bear what I
am saying. instead, I scribbled a note asking, "Under wbat law
and under what regulation are you obliging me to suppiy you
with my social insurance number?" To this day I am awaiting
an answer. 1 feel that the insurance company is invading my
privacy. is the minister aware of such actions?

Senstor Moigat: -was he prepared and did he make similar

statements he made, as 1 quoted, regarding the decision of the
Premier of Manitoba?
Senator Murray: Sureiy. honourabie senators, my honourabie friend secs the difference between the two subjects. ln the
case of Manitoba 1 was discussing a decision by the Premier of
Manitoba, the Government of Manitoba, to withdraw a resolution from their order paper t0 implement or to ratify an accord
that had been signed by the previous Government of Manitoba
together with nine other provinces and the federai goverfiment.
That is squarely a federai-provincial matter. What 1 was
pointing out to the honourabie senator about Bill loi is that
the judges of the Supreme Court of Canada had taken some
pains to reaffirm in their judgment that these malters were
squarely matters for the Province of Quebec to legisiate on.
Senator Frith: Manitoba's right under the Constitution is
pureiy provincial as weii.
Senator Perrault: Of course it is.

malter.

Senator Frith: Thanks for the permission.
Senator Murray: The judges of the Supreme Court were at
some pains to reaffirm the legisiative aulhority of the province
10 legislate on that malter. Having said that, the honourable
senator is weil aware of the position of this goverfiment and, in
particular, of the Prime Minister on the question of linguistic
minorities.
* J2130)

There is essentialiy no difierence in the position that we
have taken here from the position that we took last April, 1
believe il was, and iast June in the case of Saskatchewan and
Alberta.
The federal government, within provincial jurisdiction,
always seeks 10 support linguistic minorities across the country. The federai government does so in cooperation with the
provincial governments and through the mechanism of agreements which il has with ail of the provincial governmenîs, if 1
am flot mistaken, and certainly with the Province of Quebec.
So within the provincial jurisdiction we assist the linguislic
minorities through cooperation with their provincial governments. We spend hundreds of millions of dollars every year on
minority language education, as the honourable senator knows.
Within our own jurisdiction, surely our language policy is
obvious 10 ail] interested. Bi C-72 speaks for itseif. That
legisiation was passed by the previous Parliament at the
instigation of the Progressive Conservative government.

Senator Molgat: Honourable senators, the minister has saîd
that il was proper for him to make comments regarding the
action of the Manitoba government because the Manitoba
government had allegedly signed a certain document. The
Manitoba goverfiment neyer signed any document deaiing wilh
the Meech Lake Accord, t0 my knowiedge. The Premier at
that lime may have agreed at a meeting at Meech Lake, and
at another hasty meeting at the Langevin Block, but the
Manitoba goverfiment neyerSenator Murray: On whose behaif was he signing?
Seuiator Molgat: -agreed to that. Don't tell us that the
Manitoba goverfiment is committed to something, the Manitoba governmenî is not committed.
Senator Murray: Don't bc so fooiish!
Senator MoIgat: You may have wanted that goverfiment to
be committed, but it was flot.
Senator Corbin: Neither was New Brunswick!
Senator Frith: The Constitution says "a legisiature of a
province".
Senator Molgat: 1 agree with my. honourable friend when he

says that the federai governmenî bas been assisting linguistic
minorities across the country, but what has the federal goverfiment done for the linguistic minority in Quebec? Has my
honourabie friend spoken out?
So I come back to ask the minister this question. Does he
support the actions of the Bourassa government, yes or no,
and, if he is able 10 criticize the Premier of Manitoba in the
way thal he has criticized and iectured him as to what he
oughl to do and ought flot 10 do, is he prepared to do the same
with Mr. Bourassa?
Senator Murray: Honourable senators, the honourable senator is talking nonsense on a number of points.
Senator Molgat: Not at ail!
Senator Murray: The honourabie senalor is suggesîing that
the premiers of ten provinces signed the Meech Lake Accord
in some personai capaciîy without agreeing to bind their

Senator Murray: Thal is the most ridiculous îhing i have

their respective governments those premiers signed the Meech
Lake Accord. Sa the honourable senator is really talking
nonsense on that point.
Senator Molgat: Honourable senators, 1 object to that statement. 1 amrnfot going to sit here and have the minister say that
1 am talking nonsense on what is an absolute fact. The
Province of Manitoba did flot sign that agreement.
Seator Murray: Honourable senatars, the then Premier of
the Province of Manitoba, on behalf of tbe then government,
signed that agreement.
Senator Frith: And agreed ta submit that ta the legisiature.
And did he flot witbdraw?
Senator Murray: Quite right. The honourable senator
invites me ta condemn the Government of Quebec for having
invoked the "notwitbstanding" clause. 1 was invited ta do the
same by the media yesterday or the day before. 1 will give the
bonourable senatar the same answer 1 gave then. The "notwitbstanding- clause is part of the Charter of Rights and
Freedoms that the bonourable senator is sa proud of and which
was passed by the Parliament of Canada in 1982. The -notwitbstanding" clause was acceptedSenator Frith: Lougheed proposed that.
Senator Murray: -by Mr. Trudeau as the price of patriating the Constitution of Canada witb nine provinces out of ten
on board. Anyone who believes that individual rights and
freedoms sbould be protected from governments has ta believe,
as tbe Prime Minister said yesterday, and as 1 repeated, that
tbe existence of a "notwitbstanding" clause is incompatible
with that. lt is incompatible with the existence of a Charter of
Rights and Freedoms; nevertheless the "notwithstanding"
clause is there. It is a legitimate part of the Constitution of
Canada, whicb was passed by the honourable senator and bis
friends.
Senator Frith: As the price paid ta Premier Lougbced!
Senator Murray: That was the price paid for patriating the
Constitution with nine aut of ten provinces on board.
As 1 said yesterday, 1 would not rush ta condemn a gavernment for using a disposition that is in the Constitution. Further
ta that, 1 said that it is nat at the top of aur agenda, as a
gavernment, ta try ta negotiate the 'notwithstanding- clause
out of the Constitution. There are other matters that we have
agreed must be on the agenda-Senate reform, aboriginal
rights and sa forth.
Honourable senators had better get used ta the fact that the
"notwitbstanding" clause is going ta be there for a long time.
The federal gavernmcnt bas flot bad recaurse ta it. but the
Saskatchewan government bas bad in a labour case and
Qucbec bas had in ane or twa cases.
Senator Molgat: Honourable senators, the minister says that
1 asked him ta condemn the Province of Quebec for using the
-notwitbstanding" clause. Nat at ail! 1 did flot ask him ta
condemn anyane. 1 simply asked him the question: Does the
minister agree with what the Province of Quebec has donc, yes

or na, because the mînister bas made some very damaging
statements regarding the Premier of the Province of Manitoba
and the actions that he took? 1 am nfot asking hîm ta condemn
anyone.
Does the minister stand by the statemfents that he made witb
regard ta the actions of the Premier of Manitaba in ceasing ta
hold bearings in that province on the Meecb Lake Accord?

Senator Murray: My honourable friend should relax. Tbis is
very bad for his blood pressure.
Senator Molgat: The minister sbould bear the statements
that are being made in Manitoba.
Senator Murray: 1 find the decision of tbe Government of
New Brunswick ta be more congenial and more constructive.
It bas decidcd ta refer the Meecb Lake Accord, whicb had
been signed by Mr. McKenna's predecessor, ta a legisiative
committee for public bearings.
Seuiator Perrault: Tell us about the gavcrnment of Mr.
Bourassa!
Senator Murray: Do 1 stand by the statements that 1 made
with regard ta the decision of the Government of Manitoba?
Yes, 1 do, and 1 can provide, tomorrow perbaps, or later this
evening, if my friend is interested, a transcript of the remarks
that 1 made ta tbe media yesterday on that subject.
Senator Molgat: One final question, if 1 may. The Province
of Manitoba is committed ta bolding public bearings on constitutional changes.
Senator Murray: Oh!
Senator Molgat: That was a decision made by the Province
of Manitoba some time aga.
If there are gaing ta be constitutional changes, there must
be public hearings. Docs the minister believe tbat the Province
of Manitoba shauld naw praceed ta hold public hearings on the
Meech Lake Accordi?
* (2140)

Senator Murray: Honourable senators, the answer must be
evident. Tbe then Premier of Manitoba committed bis government ta placing a resolution before the bouse. That commitment was respected as of last week by Premier Filmon, who
made a very claquent speech, I may say, an the subject of the
importance of Mcech Lake ta the future of Canada; and, if I
may be permitted ta say sa in parentheses, the reasons that be
invoked in favour of Meech Lake last week are as valid today
as tbey were then. If their rules provide, as my fricnd tells me
and as I tbink we ail recagnize, that public bearings must
follaw the presentation of a constitutional resolution in the
Flouse, then, of course, public hearings would be an essential
part of the commitment.

POSITION

Hon. Allan J. MacEachen (Leader of the Opposition):
Honourable senators, 1 should like to ask the Leader of the
Government whether he would help us understand precisely
what the attitude of the Government of Canada is to the

solution proposed by the Premier of Quebec. We ail understand that the -notwithstanding" clause is available. and the
effect of the -notwithstanding" clause in these circumstances
is to remove rights from certain citizens which are guaranteed
in the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms and the
Québec Charter. 1 should like to know whether it is acceptable
to the Government of Canada and whether it supports the
diminishment of rights, through this process, of certain
Canadian citizens.
Hon. LoweIl Murray (Leader of the Government, Minister
of State for Federal-Provincial Relations and Acting Minister
of Communications): Honourable senators, 1 suppose Mr.
Bourassa would make the argument that the situation of the
linguistic minority under the present initiative is better than it
was under Bill 101, but that is a matter of opinion. As 1
indicated earlier, Mr. Bourassa has said that the government
had 14 options before it. 1 do flot know what the options were;
1 did flot examine them and, therefore, 1 am not in a position
to judge whether the solutionSenator Oison: Answer the question!
Senator Perrault: Very conservative! Waffle, waffle, waffle!
Senator Murray: 1 am flot in a position to judge whether the
so-called "inside-outside" solution is the apprapriate one and
whether it is the best ane to balance, as the court suggested
should be done, the valid objectiveSenator Perrault: Disgusting!
Senator Murray: --of preserving the "l'usage linguistique"
of Quebec with the need ta protect freedom of expression and
the right of the anglophone minarity.
Senator MacEachen: It is true that there apparently have
been options available to the Government of Québec. 1 don't
know any more than the Leader of the Gavernment knows
about what those options are, but what we do know is that the
Government of Québec chose an option which has the effect of
diminishing the rights guaranteed in the Charter ta Canadian
citizens. That is the option that has been accepted.
What the Leader of the Government is saying on this matter
which has electrified the country both in Quebec and elsewhere is that the Government of Canada has no view.
Senator Perrault: No view. Future of the country!
Senator MacEachen: If the government is saying it does flot
have any view about this development, then 1 wish the Leader
of the Government would tell us. If there is no view, then fine,
we would know that.

Senator Murray: Honourable senators, once again 1 have
tried to deal with the matter as fully as 1 can. and 1 would
invite the attention of the honourable senator and others to the
[Scnator Murra>

statements that were made by the Prime Minister today and
yesterday in the House of Commons on this matter. The
honourable senator says there is a diminishment of rights. 1
have told him that the Bourassa government would probably
argue that, in terms of those rights, the present measure is an
improvement over Bill 101 in its original form. but that, as 1
said, is a matter of opinion.
The honourable senator should carefully read the unanimous judgment that was brought down by the Supremne Court
of Canada on this matter.

Senator Frith: Which said their rights were diminished!
Exactly!
Senator Murray: In that matter they discussed at some
length the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms and the
Québec Charter. As the honourable senator knows. in the
Canadian Charter there is a limitation permitted on rights in
Article 1Senator Frith: Yes, but they did flot faîl under Article 1.
Senator Murray: -in that the rights are subject to those
limitations that can be justified, et cetera, in a free and
democratic society. Secondly, there is Article 33. which was
accepted by Mr. Trudeau as the price for patriation of the
Constitution in 1982.
The Supreme Court went on to state very clearly that
ensuring the cultural security of francophone Quebecers was a
valid objective and an important objective for Québec; that it
was squarely within their jurisdiction to legislate in this
matter. They discussed the guarantees of freedomn of expression in the two Charters. They gave some hints as to how the
gaverfiment might effectively balance these two concepts. The
Government of Québec has responded, and, as I say, it
responded having studied 14 options beforehand. I am flot in a
position to comment on the option it chose, flot having seen the
other 13.
Senator Frith: AIli of that must mean "no view"!
Senator MacEachen: That is just an extraordinary comment. The minister responsible for this dossier in Canada, on a
development which the Premier of Manitoba has called an
impending and developing crisis, is unable to give a view as to
whether the action taken by the Québec government is acceptable or unacceptable to the Government of Canada. "I have no
view," says the minister on behaîf of the gaverfiment, "no view
at aIl."
Senator Perrault: Sad!
Senator MacEachen: I think that is quite extraordinary.
Senator Perrault: Tragic!
Senator MacEachen: I want him ta say how it is that the
goverfiment has fia view when one of his colleagues is quoted
in La Presse as saying today that the action taken by the
Government of Québec is perfectly justified; in other words,
that it is appropriate in these circumstances to diminish the
rights of certain Canadian citizens whîch have been granted to
them by the Charter. Now the leader says that the Govern-

Senator Perrault: Hear, hear!
Senator MacEachen: Everyone bas a view except the government, because it is al'raid to state a view.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear!
Senator Murray: Honourable senators, let the record show
that the full statement by my colleague, the Secretary of State,
Mr. Bouchard, was that having recourse to the "notwithstanding- clause is a legitimate and legal act in the context of the

wben he spoke befote the United Nations. 1 think it is inappropriate for a country lîke Canada, which bas in the past been
activeiy involved in such matters, simpiy to be sulent in this
instance. Therefore, 1 ask the minister when there wilI be sorne
response by the Canadian government to these very important
questions that were raised by Mr. Gorbachev.
Hon. Loweii Murray (Leader of the Government, Minister
of State for Federai-Provincial Relations and Acting Minister
of Communications): Honourabie senators, on December 7,
which was the date of President Gorbachev's address to the
General Assembly of the United Nations, the Prime Minister
issued a brief statement with regard to the President's
announcement about unilateral reductions in miiitary forces.
Further to that, on December 8. the NATO ministers issued a
statement on conventional arms control. 0f course, Canada is
part of that alliance. Our view is that, taken together, President Gorbachev's announcement and the December 8 statement on conventional arms control issued by NATO ministers
indicate that both sides are preparing seriousiy for the negotiations, to begin next year, aimed at maintaining stability in
Europe at iower levels of conventional forces. These wiii be
important negotiations, because, even after the announced
Soviet reductions bave been impiemented, serious conventional
force imbalances to the benefit of the Warsaw Pact wili
remain. In our view the prospects for serious and productive
negotiations have neyer been better. Honourable senators, tbat
information is taken from a staternent made by rny colleague,
the Secretary of State for Externai Affairs.
With regard to the proposais made by President Gorbachev
on commercial debt reduction and a call for an international
debt conférence, 1 can tell honourable senators that these are
also under consideration, although tbe government bas reservations about any scherne to transfer responsibility for commercial debts to the public sector. We do believe that the use
of existing international fora obviates the need for a debt
conference.
Canada bas been a leader in bilaterai and multilaterai
efforts to case the debt burden of developing countries and
help them carry out essential economic reforrns. We and a
number of other deveioped countries have already written off
much of the officiai deveioprnent assistance debt for the Ieast
deveioped countries. We also took action at the Toronto
Summit on the matter of debt relief. My coileague states that
we are prepared to work constructiveiy with the U.S.S.R. and
other countries in finding reaiistic and constructive approaches
to managing the probiems of the less developed countries'
indebtedness.
i do flot have notes from my coileague with regard to the
staternents of President Gorbachev on environmentai matters,
but i shahl ask him what comment he may wish to convey to
the Senate in that regard.
Senator Oison: If 1 rnay, 1 wil point out to the Leader of the
Government that these statements, innocuous as they are, are
flot entirely satisfactory. Take, for exampie, the Third Worid
debt problem, which we in this country have regarded as one
of the major difficulties facing world commerce. lndeed. many
1Senator Oison. 1

believe that a crisis wilI develop unless some additionai action
is taken. It scers to me that ail the Leader of the Government
bas said is that Canada is acting cautiously and that the
government does flot believe that any further action needs to
be taken. 1 think that is an inappropriate response.
1 shall simply ask again whether the Government of Canada
intends to take some further action involving the other haif of
the world-something which bas neyer happened before-in
trying to corne to grips with this critical problem.
Honourable senators, 1 will go no further today, but 1 hope
that the Leader of the Government will give us somne indication
of what the response of the governrnent will be with respect to
the significant offer made by President Gorbachev with
respect to the environment.
FIRST MINISTERS
PROSPECTIVE MEETING-MEECH LAKE ACCORD AS AGENDA
ITEM

Hon. Jack Austin: Honourable senators, 1 have a question
supplementary to others that were raised earlier with respect
to the situation in Quebec. 1 arn sure the Leader of the
Government is aware that this evening three members of the
Bourassa cabinet, ail anglophones, resigned frorn their positions, and the fourth member bas not yet taken a decision in
that regard. 1 raise the question simply to demonstrate once
again the sensitivities that are being expressed in the province
of Quebec in a language group that does feed threatened.
e (2200)

The Toronto Star today is quoting Senator Murray as
having taken steps to organize an informai meeting of First
Ministers in January. Can Senator Murray confirm that this is
being done, and can he also tell us the purpose of that
meeting?
Hon. Loweil Murray (Leader of the Government, Minister
of State for Federai-Provincial Relations and Acting Minister
of Communications): Honourable senators, 1 can only tell the
bouse that in October the Prime Minister wrote to the First
Ministers because the annual First Ministers' Conference had
been scheduled [or November and had to be cancelied because
of the caliing of the election. He wrote to them to indicate that
he would be caiiing thern together sorne time eariy in the new
mandate, as he put it, for an informai meeting, and that this
would probabiy be followed by a more formai meeting later on.
No date has been set, but we wiil be in touch with the
provinces before long to arrange an informai meeting. This is
the practice that was foiiowed immediateiy after the 1984
election.

Senator Austin: Can we expect the question of the process of
the approval of Meech Lake to be one of the agenda items?
Senator Murray: Honourabie senators, i would be astonished if it were not.

SENATE DEBATES

SPEECH FROM THE THRONE
MOTION FOR ADDRESS IN REPLY-DEBATE CONTINUED

On the Order:
Resuming the debate on the motion of the Honourable
Senator Chaput-Rolland, seconded by the Honourable
Senator Doyle, for an Address to Her Excellency the
Governor General in reply to Her Speech at the opening
of the Session.-(Honourable Senator Giganti's). (Isi
day of resuming debate)
Hon. Philippe Deane Gigantès: Honourable senators, 1yield
temporarily to Senator Frith.
Hon. Royce Frith (Depmjty Leader of the Opposition): Honourable senators, 1 asked Senator Gigantès to yield to me very
briefly because 1 sbould like to make a comment about this
debate.
1 believe that we are departing from tradition-not from tbe
rules but fromi tradition-in this place as it relates to the
motion for an address to Her Excellency the Governor General
in reply to ber speech at the opening of the session. As 1recaîl
it in the twelve years that 1have been here, this debate usually
consists of a motion proposed by a new member of the bouse
on the government side and seconded by anotber member of
tbe bouse on tbe government side. The wording of the address
is, in part:
We, Her Majesty's most loyal and dutiful subjects, the
Senate of Canada in Parliament assembled, beg leave to
offer our humble tbanks to Your Excellency for the
gracious Speech whicb Your Excellency bas addressed to
botb Houses of Parliament.
The tradition bas been that the debate wbicb follows consists of speeches by tbe mover and seconder speaking about the
Senate and often about their province-some information or a
position taken by the province, that is, the senator's province,
in general, and usually the speech is very non-partisan. For
that reason the debate usually ends there.
1 may be wrong-and I hope that 1 am, in a sense, but 1 do
not think 1 am-but 1 do not ever remnember the debate
consisting of anything more than the contribution by the
mover and the seconder, because it is usually of such a
non-partisan nature that nobody bas any trouble supporting it.
Therefore, the opposition does net intercede in the debate.
However, in this instance the mover, Senator Chaput-Rolland, apparently provoked Senator Gigantès by some of the
things that she said.
Senator Barootes: That's easy to do.
Senator Frith: 1 cannot say that Senator Gigantès needs to
feel perfectly lonely about this, because, for example, Senator
Chaput-Rolland said that she wants to say as clearly as she
can that:
... when a majority of non-elected members believes tbat
it bas inberited a morality of decisions, then it does not
serve its country nor its party very well.
1 cannot imagine anyone in this Senate, other than ail of tbe
senators on this side who would be so described, wbo would be

in Senator Chaput-Rolland's mind. The only reason 1 am less
provoked, perbaps, than Senator Gigantès is that 1 do not
know wbat *"inheriteda morality of decisions" means. Maybe
Senator Gigantès will be able to tell us wbat that means.
If we are hreaking with tradition-maybe we want t-perhaps the address in reply should be more partisan and
should launcb a general debate on the Speech from the
Throne. However, my recollection is that it neyer bas before:, 1
preferred it the other way. I hope tbat the more partisan
nature of the address in this case was not meant to set the tone
for the Parliament that we are now launcbing.
Senator Gigantès: Honourable senators. 1 sbould like to
congratulate Senator Solange Chaput-Rolland for reviving the
noble 17th Century oratorical tradition of the French cathedrals, where grammar, syntax and vocabulary were mixed with
incense in adulatory addresses to the ricb and powerful. Not
since Bossuet, or Fénelon even, bas language played sucb
music for a ruler's ear. Laudable îndeed is loyalty.
Less laudable, however, are professions of devotion to national reconciliation wben they are adulterated by tbe uttering
of inventions authored by tbose wbose avowed aim is the
breakup of Canada.
The invention in question is tbe one ecboed by the Honourable Senator Solange Chaput-Rolland when she said that tbe
promises made to Quebec during the 1980 referendum were
not bonoured by the government of Prime Minister Pierre
Elliott Trudeau.
The invention-the mytb-is that to defeat the Péquistes in
the referendum Mr. Trudeau promised to give Quebec a
Meech Lake type of provincialist constitution, and that baving
defeated the separatists he reneged on bis promise.
He did promise a renewed federalism, but it was unarguably
clear from the very first, and throughout the referendum
campaign, that he was promising wbat be eventually delivered
with tbe Constitution of 1982, and nothing more.
Did Mr. Trudeau and bis lieutenants deliberately allow the
people of Quebec to mislead themselves into tbinking that be
had suddenly changed from being a believer in a strong
national government to a proponent of more power for the
"Billy Vander Zalms"' or the "Sterling Lyons" of this world?
Absolutely not.
Certainly, the late Mr. René Lévesque bad no delusions
about what Mr. Trudeau meant by "renewed federalism". In
an interview printed by Le Devoir on May 16, 1980, four days
before the referendum, Mr. Lévesque said that judging by
[Translation]

some comments Trudeau made recently, . .. the new
formula (will) be as centralizing ... as ever.
[English]
This was not an attempt by Mr. Lévesque to distort the
views of Mr. Trudeau and bis government, apart from tbe fact
that the late Premier of Quebec used tbe word "centralisateur" to describe the strong national government Mr.
Trudeau wanted.
...

SENATE DEBATES

SENATE DEBATES
( 2210)

However, that is flot aIl. Mr. Chrétien, speaking for the
Trudeau government, made sure that no one could have any
delusions about what Mr. Trudeau was promising. Towards
the end of the referendum campaign Mr. Jeffrey Simpson of
the Globe and Mail asked Mr. Jean Chrétien on CTV's
Question Period what Mr. Trudeau's "renewed federalsim"
meant. Mr. Chrétien replied, and I quote:
What we have to do, basically, is to recognize some
basic principles that should preside over the elaboration of
a new constitution. The principles are that you need a
national government; .. . that the federal government
should be strong enough to be able to redistrîbute the
wealth of Canada, and aIl that being done without giving
any province a real special status.
One person who could not possibly have deluded herself
about what Mr. Trudeau meant was the Honourable Senator
Solange Chaput-Rolland. After aIl, she had been a member of
the Pepin-Robarts commission that had proposed to Mr. Trudeau, as she has so often written, something close to the
Meech Lake Accord, and she certainly made no secret-in
numerous articles--of her anger at Mr. Trudeau for rejecting
her constitutional blandishments. Suddenly, now she says she
believes what she earlier knew not to be so.
What is wrong with that? What is wrong is that site
encourages those who wish to deceive moderate Quebecers and
make them bitter towards the national Government of
Canada. What these people are saying-and it is a carefully
orchestrated campaîgn of lies-is: "Those of you who voted
against the Péquistes were tricked; you were lied to; you
cannot trust Ottawa." It is a common tactic, the "we was
robbed" tactic of the boxing manager. In this instance it is
destructive of national unity, because it tells the citizens of a
whole province that they cannot trust the rest of Canada. At
this particular time it is particularly destructive. -You was
robbed.- It is a natural reflex. The Secretary of State, the
Honourable Lucien Bouchard, was in the grip of that reflex,
no doubt, when he said, during the campaign, that opposition
to the free trade deal was a sinister. anti-Quebec plot hatched
in Ontario-even though some of his cabinet colleagues were
saying ail over Ontario that it was Ontario which would most
benefit from the trade deal. Pitting one province against
another in a country such as ours is destructive of national
unity.
However, I believe that the Honourable Senator ChaputRolland now truly believes what she earlier knew so well not to
be so. Why do I believe that? Because I too have sinned. I once
believed what I knew not to be believable. I once believed that
in the Joint Committee on Canada's International Relations.
of which both Senator Doyle and I were members. Tories and
Liberals couîd use the same words to mean the same things.
My father had warned me about the danger of making such
assumptions. But I forgot. and I signed a document thinking
its words meant what I thought they meant, in their entirety
and in their context.
IScnator Gigintlc.

December 20, 1988
December 20, 1988

1 arn referring, of course, to the statement made by Senator
Doyle in this chamber on December 13. He saîd, and I quote:
We urged that the Prime Minister immediately undertake
the steps that would lead to a treaty that would produce
freer trade between the United Staies and Canada.
Let me read to you what was actually recommended in the
report that Senator Doyle and 1 both signed. 1 quote from page
147:
The committee recommends that the government make
strenuous efforts to achieve orderly and balanced trade
liberalization.
The committee believes it is important to begin a new
round of multilateral trade negotiations as expeditiously
as possible.
It is essential that any agreement between Canada and
the United States be entirely consistent with the obligations of both countries to the G ATT.
Honourable senators, these recommendations summarize the
foreword and chapter six of the report written by the Joint
Committee on Canada's International Relations.
Let me give you some more quotations. On page 14 of this
report it says:
Most of these witnesses were worried that U.S. influence
of one kind or another would undermine the country's
independence. This concern showed itself in several policy
contexts.
Then on page 68:
As we discussed in our interim report. these factors
persuaded the government that it was necessary to explore
the possibility of negotiating freer trade arrangements
with the United States.
Honourable senators, the anxiety by ail of the witnesses was
clearly expressed. It was not something that this committeeor at least the Liberal members of this committee-signed
enthusiastically; they signed with apprehension. The context in
which we discussed the Free Trade Agreement with the U.S.
was the GATT context and Article XXIV of the GATT, which
defines a free trade zone as one in which aIl tariffs are
eventually eliminated. We did not recommend, nor did we
discuss, giving away such things as we gave away in Article
1603 of the Free Trade Agreement, relinquishing our GATT
rights to impose conditions on foreign investors. Nor did we
discuss in the committee giving Americans the right to buy
unconditionally any Canadian company, as is set forth in the
annex to Article 1607.3 of the Free Trade Agreement. We
thought we were signing a document that dealt with what we
had discussed. In the event, we are told by Senator Doyle that
we signed much more. It was our mistake. Next time we
Liberals should have lawyers define every word before we sign
a unanimnous report.
0 (2220)

Therefore, honourable senators, if I could be led to believe
what I earlier knew I should not believe, why should I object to
Senator Chaput-Rolland showing the same intellectual frailty

QUESTION PERIOD
THE CONSTITUTION
MEECH LAKE ACCORD-FIRST MIN ISTERS' MEETINGSPARTICIPATION BY TERRITORIES

Hon. Paul Lucier: Honourable senators, in the spring of this
year, when it appeared that the Meecb Lake Accord was in
some difficulty, 1 asked tbe Leader of the Government if be
would consider calling meetings witb the premiers to bave
further discussions. At that time be assured me that it was this
accord or notbing. 1 accepted that. 1 do not know if 1 agreed,
but 1 know tbat that was wbat be was saying.
Tbe Meecb Lake Accord bas been brought into tbe Bill 101
question by tbe Premier of Quebec and by Mr. Filmon. Tbey
bave been tied together, and it appears that there will now
bave to be meetings with tbe government and the premiers to
discuss Meech Lake.
My question to tbe Leader of the Government is this: If
sucb discussions concerning Meech Lake take place at any
time in the future, wilh he ensure tbat the ehected representatives of the Yukon and tbe Nortbwest Territories are present
for tbose discussions? At this time 1 am not asking bim what
wihh or wilh not be discussed. 1 am oniy asking for the assurance
that, if there are discussions, the ehected leaders of both
territories wilh be present for the discussions, because they
were not present the last time.

of Communications): Honourable senators, my friend's question is based on a faulty hypothesis, namely, that discussions
might be held to reopen the Meech Lake Accord. There is no
intention of doing so.
The one point of the premise to his question with which I
agree is that there will be meetings of First Ministers in the
future. The Prime Minister so indicated in a letter he sent to
the premiers in October, after the election was called, necessitating the cancellation of the meeting that had been scheduled for November. There will be a private luncheon or a
private meeting of First Ministers after the turn of the new
year, as was done following the 1984 election.
I believe we can probably look forward, if there is agreement, to a more formai public meeting of First Ministers later
on. At that meeting, as at previous formai public sessions, the
territorial governments would of course be represented and the
leaders of those governments would be invited to speak.
Senator Lucier: Honourable senators, of course this is a
hypothesis; it has to be. That is how Meech Lake came about.
No one knew that it was happening until the day it took place,
and then it was too late to speak about it.
*

(1410)

The people of the Yukon and the Northwest Territories
were not represented when the meetings took place. The whole
of Meech Lake was done without the participation of either of
the territories. I am asking for the minister's assurance that, if
discussions take place again concerning Meech Lake, we shall
be at the table and shall be represented by our elected representatives, as the other people of Canada are.
I have a quotation here from a statement made by the
Premier of Alberta last week. He said:
Meech Lake is an agreement between first ministers. If
there are any problems with Meech Lake, I think we
should get together as first ministers and make sure we
bring the premiers who are having trouble on side.
You do not have to know a lot more than that about the
mentality of the premiers to know why I am asking this
question. The people of the north want to be represented if the
north is being discussed at any constitutional meetings.
I would like the assurance of the minister that the government will at least ask the premiers if they will have our elected
representatives there. If they will not do that and the premiers
object, we would like to know which premiers object.
Senator Murray: Honourable senators, the question remains
hypothetical.
Senator Lucier: The answer remains very blank.
MEECH LAKE ACCORD-FIRST MINISTERS' MEETING-STATUS
OF REPRESENTATIONS OF PREMIER OF MANITOBA-REQUEST
FOR COPY OF GOVERNMENT'S REPLY

Hon. Jack Austin: Honourable senators, at the last sitting I
asked the government leader whether Meech Lake would be
on the agenda of a First Ministers' meeting. He said that he
would be astonished if it were not.
ISenator Murra.]

December 27, 1988
December 27. 1988

With respect to that meeting, bas the government leader
just told us that the representations of Premier Filmon with
respect to changes in the Meech Lake Accord will be rejected?
Hon. Lowel Murray (Leader of the Government, Minister
of State for Federal-Provincial Relations and Acting Minister
of Communications): The honourable senator had asked
whether Meech Lake would be discussed. I hope I did not
misunderstand his question, and I hope he did not misunderstand my answer. Of course, the status of the agreement that
has been reached by the First Ministers is almost certain to
come up at the meeting. However, that is not to say that the
First Ministers would be addressing themselves to changes in
the accord. That would astonish me.
Senator Austin: But, as I just said to the minister, Premier
Filmon has said that he has changes to suggest in the Meech
Lake Accord. Is the minister suggesting that those will be
rejected or have already been rejected?
Senator Murray: Honourable senators, I am unaware of any
changes being advocated by Premier Filmon.
Senator Austin: So the minister is saying that no representations have been made by the Premier of Manitoba with respect
to the Meech Lake Accord that suggest any changes in the
accord.
Senator Murray: That is correct, honourable senators.
Hon. Gildas L. Molgat: Honourable senators, I have a
supplementary question. Has the Prime Minister, the Minister
of State for Federal-Provincial Relations or the government
received a letter from Premier Filmon requesting a meeting on
constitutional matters?
Senator Murray: Yes, honourable senators. I believe that
letter was made public by the Government of Manitoba.
Further to that, the premier called me just before he
announced that his government was withdrawing the resolution from the order paper of their legislature.
Senator Molgat: So the government has received the
request, then, from Premier Filmon. Has the government
responded that they would agree to such a meeting?
Senator Murray: Honourable senators, the response of the
government was that the Prime Minister had already written
to the premiers in October suggesting that an informal meeting would be held early in the second mandate of the government. That meeting wili be held as soon as a mutually
convenient date can be set.
Senator Molgat: So we are to understand that the government has not responded to the recent letter from the Premier
of Manitoba. In other words, there has been no answer.
Senator Murray: Honourable senators, i cannot say for
certain whether a letter has been sent to Premier Filmon, but I
am virtually certain that his government and his officials have
been reminded of the previous letter that the Prime Minister
sent to the premiers in October. That constitutes our response
to his call for a meeting.

MEECH LAKE ACCORD-SENATE REFORM-REPRESENTATIONS
0F PREMIER 0F MANITOBA

Hon. Jack Austin: Honourable senators, 1 have a question
for the Leader of the Gavernment that is supplementary ta my
previaus question. The Globe and Mail of yesterday's date
quotes Premier Filmon as saying that the Meech Lake Accord
is too narrow, because it faits ta include any assurance of a
reformed Senate. Premier Filmon bas said that Senate reform
is urgently needed ta protect the interests of smaller provinces.
1 should like ta ask the Leader of the Government in the
Senate whether this information bas been communicated ta
the minister.
Hon. LoweIl Murray (Leader of the Government, Minister
of State for Federal-Provincial Relations and Acting Minister
of Communications): Honourable senators, the minister reads
the Globe and Mail, as do my bonourable friends opposite. 1
have seen the reference ta which my bonourable friend refers
and my only comment on it is the same as 1 would make ta the
proposition advanced a week or so ago by Senatar Molgat, that
at Meech Lake we sbould have donc sometbing about the
"notwithstanding" clause, because the purpose of the Meech
Lake exercise was ta repair the great gap that had been left in
1982 and ta bring Qucbcc back into the constitutianal family.
Further in reply ta cither Premier Filmon or Senatar
Molgat, or anyonc cisc, in regard ta the "notwithstanding"
clause, reform of the Senate or any of these other important
issues, 1 would say that it wauld nat have made vcry good
sense ta hold Quebec's return hostage ta a successful negotiation of these other, unrelated issues.
Hon. Royce Frith: But Quebcc must have feit itself included
in the Constitution in order ta invoke the "notwithstanding"~
clause in that very Constitution.
MEECH LAKE ACCORD-CONSIDERATION 0F
"NOTWITHSTANDING" CLAUSE IN CHARTER 0F RIGHTSREPRESENTATION 0F PREMIER 0F MANITOBA-REQUEST FOR
REPLY TO PREMIER'S TELEPHONE CALLS

Hon. Joseph-Philippe Guay: Hanourable senators, it seemns
ta me that bath the Leader of the Government in the Senate
and the bouse leader in the other place invariably make
reference ta the 1981-82 constitutional negatiatians when they
talk about the "notwithstanding" clause. 1 am among those
people who believe that tbat matter could have been rectified
wben the Meech Lake Accord was under consideration.
However, the prescrnt Premier of Manitoba, Mr. Filman,
was not involved in the discussions at Meech Lake. There have
been questions by ather honourable senators today as ta
wbether or not the Prime Minister bas answered Mr. Filmon's
letters. 1 am flot sa concerned about the letters as 1 am about

the telephone cali that Mr. Filmon made ta the Prime Minister
and ta which, be bas claimed, he did flot receive a response. 1
would ask the Leader of the Government in the Senate if he
would do sometbing about this matter in arder that Mr.
Filmon migbt receive a satisfactary response.
Hon. Lowel Murray (Leader of the Government, Minister
of State for Federal-Provincial Relations and Acting Minister
of Communications): Honourable senatars, when Premier
Filmon called me a week or ten days ago, 1 took the caîl.
However, when Mr. Filmon tried ta caîl the Prime Minister,
the Prime Minister was on bis way ta Question Period in the
House of Commons. 1 can assure the banaurable senator that
there was no discourtesy offered ta the premier or ta the
Government of Manitoba, or ta any other government. If the
Premier of Manitoba wisbes ta enter inta contact witb the
Prime Minister, that will be arranged as soon as possible.
Tbere is no problem there.
However, 1 do wish ta came back ta the matter of the
.'notwitbstanding" clause and ta atber issues which people tell
us we sbould have repaired at Meech Lake, whether it be the
rights of the aboriginal peoples, improving the constitutional
recognition of multiculturalism or whatever. There was anc
autstanding gap that remained ta bc filed after 1982, and that
was ta bring Quebec back into the constitutional family.
Quebec had indicated that there were five conditions under
wbich it would return ta the constitutional family. The ten
premiers, meeting in Edmonton in August of 1986, had agreed
that the Quebec Round would cancentrate on bringing Quebec
back into the constitutional family on tbe basis of those five
conditions, and that they would flot allow linkages ta take
place witb other issues, such as Senate reform and sa forth,
which would be put off ta a second round of canstitutional
negotiatians ta take place after Quebec was back in.
Let me say that it would flot have been fair and it would not
have been very wise ta bave tried ta settle a range of other
constitutianal issues-whether it be Senate reform, the "notwithstanding" clause or whatever-wbich were unrelated ta
the return of Quebec ta the constitutional family.
0 (1420)
Senator Guay: Honourable senators, the Prime Minister and
the minister keep referring ta that clause in the Charter of
1981 and 1982. Apparently they were aware that this clause
sbould be rectified, but in fact it was flot rectified in the
Meech Lake Accord. It would have been easy at that time ta
change that particular clause, and it would flot bave donc any
harm with regard ta "getting the whole family back togetber",
as the honourable senator bas put it.
Senator Murray: Hanourable senators, flot only would it
bave been difficult ta make that change then but it would be
fia casier ta do sa today. That clause was accepted by Prime
Minister Trudeau.
Senator Hastings: At the insistence of Peter Lougheed.
Senator Murray: Ves, it was demanded by variaus premiers.
However, it is there in the Charter now, and ta negotiate aur
way out of it would require other concessions.

THE CONSTITUTION
INCLUSION OR EXCLUSION 0F QUEBEC

Hon. Royce Frith (Deputy Leader of the Opposition): Honourable senators, may 1 ask a question of the Leader of the
Government with regard 10 the phrase "in and out of the
Constitution"? This phrase-namely, that Quebec is out of the
Constitution, or that Quebec has 10 be brought back mbt the
Constitution-has been used very frequently by the government in justification of the Meech Lake Accord. Quebec at
least paid a short visit back into the Constitution 10 invoke the
'"notwithstanding" clause, which is part of the Constitution il
says it was left out of, did it not?
Hon. Lowell Murray (Leader of the Government, Minister
of State for Federal-Provincial Relations and Acting Minister
of Communications): Honourable senators, the exclusion of
Quebec in 1982 had a number of immediate effects. One was
the routine invocation of the "notwithstanding" clause by two
governments of Quebec up until, 1 believe il was, the month of
March 1987. In other words, the Quebec governrnent did not
accept the legitimacy of the Canadian Charter of Rights and
Freedoms and routinely exernpted the laws of that assembly
from the operation of the Canadian Charter of Rights and
Freedoms.
Senator Frith: By using the Constitution to do it.
Senator Murray: In fact, the previous Parti Quebeçois governmenî had proposed a return t0 negotiations under certain
conditions, one of which was the exemption of Quebec from
most of the provisions of the Canadian Charter of Rights and
Freedoms. The second effect that the exclusion of Quebec

Hon. Dalia Wood- Honourable senators, my question is to
the Leader of the Government in the Senate. As 1 understand
it, he has just said that the -notwithstanding" clause is going
10 be with us for some lime and that it probably will flot be
changed. How will the government cope with the divergence of
opinion between the Prime Minister and the Secretary of

Hon. Lowell Murray (Leader of the Government, Minister
of State for Federal-Provincial Relations and Acting Minister
of Communications): Honourable senators, the difference is
largely in the mind of my honourable friend. It is not hard to
see that so long as Quebec has flot accepted the Constitution,
has not returned 10 the constitutional fold, the constitutional
family. the "notwithstanding" clause is a very important safeguard for that province.

Hon. Lowel Murray (Leader of the Government, Minister
of State for Federal-Provincial Relations and Acting Minister
of Communications): Honourable senators, I arn not sure what
the honourable senator is trying to say about the Secretary of
State's responsibility for minority language communities
across the country, but the fact of the matter is that the
present Secretary of State bas completed a number of important agreements with the provinces and, in fact, some very
important negotiations are now taking place with the Province
of Quebec relating to such matters as provincial health and
social services to the anglophone minority in Quebec.
The minister, as the record will show, is acquitting himself
of bis responsibility for minority linguistîc communities in a
very distinguished and successful fashion.
Senator Wood: The honourable senator knows that this
weekend Mr. Bourassa said that even though Mr. Bouchard
may have the right to allocate moncys to Quebec he will not
allow those to be used for bilingual purposes. Therefore, my
question is: Are the social services to be provided in only one
language?
Senator Murray: Honourable senators, 1 have not seen the
statement by Premier Bourassa to which the bonourable senator refers. Let me first simply say that we have, in our own
jurisdiction, Bill C-72, which applies across the country and to
everywhere in the country. Second, in the provincial jurisdictions il has been our policy-and a successful one it is-to
corne to the aid of linguistic minorities through cooperation
with provincial governments. We are doing that in Quebec.
My goodness, tens of millions of dollars are being spent by the
federal government pursuant to federal-provincial agreements
to assist the minority linguistic community in Quebec now.
This bas been going on for some years.

ment to sas' that there is no chance that the -notwithstandingclause will be abolished so long as Quebec bas flot signed the
Constitutional Accord. Perhaps the Leader of the Governrnent
should check the record, because that is what I understood him
to say.
Senator Flynn: Check it yourself!
Senator Murray: Honourable senators, let me take my
honourable friend through it once more.
One of the results of the exclusion of Quebec frorn the
1981-82 exercîse was that Quebec did flot accept the legitimacy of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedorns. For that
reason, up until March or April of 1987, Quebec routinely
exernpted the laws of its National Assernbly from the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedorns.
0 (14»0
The fact of the matter is that one of the resuits of Meech
Lake, once proclaîmed, will be that Quebec will accept in its
entirety the legitirnacy of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
In the meantime, as the Governrnent of Quebec and the
Secretary of State have pointed out, the "notwithstanding"
clause bas special significance for that province.
Senator Thériauit: That is the whole point. The "notwithstanding" clause was used this time in Quebec flot only to
circumvent the Constitutional Accord of 1982 and the Canadian Charter of Rights but also to circumnvent their own Charter
of Rights.

CANADA-UNITED STATES FREE TRADE

DISADVANTAGES TO CANADIANS 0F AVAILABILITY 0F
AMERICAN USED CARS

Hon. Azellus Denis: Honourable senators, may 1 ask the
Leader of the Government in the Senate a question? In the
tons of advertising for which the goverfiment paid millions,
probably a record amount, there is no mention of the possible
disadvantages of the Free Trade Agreement. On the contrary,
everything is in favour of the Free Trade Agreement.
1 read in the generalities, whîch are only hypotheses or
suppositions, that the agreement will gradually eliminate the
embargo on used cars and thus give Canadians greater choice.
1 would like to know this from the Leader of the Government:
What are the advantages of a wider choice of used cars for
Canadians?
Hon. Lowell Murray (Leader of the Government, Minister
of State for Federal-Provincial Relations and Acting Minister
of Communications): Honourable senators, my friend and
colleague wilI have the opportunity to discuss this question and
others during the debate that will begin in a few minutes.
The Senate Foreign Affairs Committee will also hold hearings where the Minister and officiaIs will be presenit 10 answer
my friend's questions.
Senator Denis: That is exactly why 1 asked you the question-so that they could be prepared for it.
1 would like to know how access to American used cars can
be advantageous. 1 heard that American used cars are much
cheaper than Canadian ones.
Hon. Joseph-Philippe Guay: lt's rust!
Senator Denis: Therefore, our used cars lose value compared to American cars as a result of the Free Trade
Agreement.
For example, once the agreement is in force, when 1 want to
trade in my car for a new one, 1 may get $200 or $300 or $400
less for it as a result of the Free Trade Agreement. 1 want to
know if that is an advantage. Besides that, we will have trouble

finding out who owned the American used cars and whether
the odometer was changed and making sure that the used car a
Canadian buys is flot completely used up or worn out.
1 do not sc in this ton of advertising what could bc to our
benefit in the Free Trade Agreement. Would it be that
Canadians will have a bigger choice of old cars, when this
wider selection will resuit in each and every car owner in
Canada losing $300 or $400 or more? For more expensive
models. it could be up to $800 or $900 or more.
Hon. Royce Frith (Deputy Leader of the Opposition): The
debate is on!

CANADA-UNITED STATES FREE TRADE
AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. Lowell Murray (Leader of the Goveroment, Minister
of State for Federal-Provincial Relations and Acting Minister
of Communications) moved the second reading of Bill C-2, to
implement the Free Trade Agreement between Canada and
the United States of America.
He said: Honourable senators, on September 7 last 1 opened
debate on second reading of Bill C-130, to implement the
Canada-United States Free Trade Agreement. On September
15 that bill received second reading and went to the Foreign
Affairs Committee. On October 1 the bill died when the
Thirty-third Parliament was dissolved and the general election
was called for November 21.
Bill C-2, which is now before the Senate for second reading,
is essentially the same bill that was before us at dissolution.
The government has returned, fortified by a mandate from the
electorate. to proceed with the Free Trade Agreement and to
proceed with this bill. That. as we have been told in the Speech
from the Throne on Decemnber 12, is the primnary purpose of
this early session of the Thirty-fourth Parliament.
Honourable senators, this chapter in the free trade debate is
comning to an end. It has been a very long one and 1 will try flot
to prolong it unduly.
[Translation]
Honourable senators, for the record, the Senate Committee
on Foreign Affairs recommended to Canadians free trade with
the United States first in 1978, and again in 1982, just as did
the Macdonald lnquiry in 1985. In ail these instances, the
recommendations came after a very comprehensive study.
In keeping with these recommendations, the governiment,
which saw the opportunity to obtain for Canada some major
economic benefits. started negotiating free trade with the
United States in June 1986, and in October 1987 reached an
agreement which was officially signed in January 1988.
Neyer before in the history of Canada were the privàte
sector and the provincial governments so scrupulously consulted during international trade negotiations.

SENATE DEBATES

The Free Trade Agreement was supported by eight provincial governments. ht was also supported by most of the various
organizations representing Canadian industrialists and exporters. ht was the subject matter of numerous independent studies
which highlighted important economic advantages for each
and every region in Canada.
In Parliament, free trade was extensively debated. The
Standing Committc on External Affairs and International
Trade of the House of Commons heard 158 witnesses in 24
days in the autumn of 1987.
The Senate Committee on Foreign Affairs held 43 meetings
and heard more than 90 witnesses in 98 hours in November
1987.
Bill C-130 was tabled in May 1988 and debated by the
House of Commons and its legislative committee during
almost 160 hours over 39 days.
Bill C-2, tabled on December 14, was debated in the other
place for 70 hours during a seven-day session with extended
hours.

[English]
Honourable senators, the Free Trade Agreement, as the
Prime Minîster has pointed out, is first and foremost an
insurance policy for two -million Canadian jobs that now
depend on our trade with the United States. Ail remaining
tariffs between our two countries wiIl be removed over a
ten-year period. It is truc to say that 80 per cent of our cxports
now enter the United States tariff-free anyway. But the tariff
remains on those value-added products, on finished goods,
where so many jobs and job opportunîties are and where, with
the removal of tariffs, there will be increased opportunities for
expansion and job creation in Canada.
Canadian consumers and producers wilI pay Iess for U.S.
products. There will be no more U.S. quotas on Canadian
uranium and steel exports, no more import taxes on Canadian
oil and gas exports and no more customs user fees on any
Canadian exports. Under this agreement we wiIl have a dispute-settling mechanism that provides a shieîd against U.S.
protectionism, whether it be from Congress or the administration. This dispute-settling mechanism is superior to that existing in any other trade agreement now in force in the world. It
bas attracted the interest of and is the envy of many other
countries, including Japan.
There are new provisions in the Free Trade Agreement
regarding services, government procurement, business travel
and investment. The obvious advantages to Canada flowing
fromn the Free Trade Agreement are sufficient, in my view, to
commend it to the support of the Senate. This Free Trade
Agreement will place on a more stable and secure basis the
largest bilateral trading arrangement in world history. That. it
seems to me, is a compelling--even a decisive-reason to
support the agreement and to support this bill.
Canada is not seeking to be part of a "fortress North
America". We recognize that the world is shrinking, that
nations are increasingly interdependent, that business, wher-

ever it is Iocated, operates more and more in an international
environment and under the influence of international conditions. The road to world competitiveness for Canada-the road
to a world-class Canadian economy-passes througb the
North American market. The framework provided hy the Free
Trade Agreement is crucial in order to create the investment
and the confidence that is necessary to make Canada competitive globally.
Honourable senators, the other day I saw a statement made
by Mr. H. Anthony Hampson, who, for 17 years, served as
chairman, president and chief executive officer of the Canada
Development Corporation. Writing in his capacity as head of
the Policy Analysis Committee of the C.D. Howe Institute on
the subject of Japanese-Canadian relations, he states:
This Japanese interest in Canada was stimulated by the
Kanao Report, the resuit of a Japanese economic mission
to Canada in the faîl of 1986 that was highly complimentary to Canada and its prospects. This report made a
worthwhile beginning in shifting Japan's perspective from
Canada's resource industries to its high-growth, higbtechnology manufacturing industries.
Mr. Hampson goes on to state:
The most powerful factor, however, in increasing Japanese awareness of Canada bas been the Free Trade
Agreement with the United States. While many Japanese
jumped rather quickly to the view that this was another
inward-looking and protectionist move, others have seen it
for what it is: a move by two of the world's greatest
proponents of freer trade to show other countries that
protectionismn is not the only alternative.
In this latter view, Canada can now be a friend of
Japan inside the U.S. gate. The Free Trade Agreement
will make that friend a stronger competitor, particularly
for manufactured products, as secure access to the large
U.S. market will provide Canadian firms with longer
production runs and lower costs.
It is to the next sentence that I would especially draw the
attention of honourable senators:
But the Agreement's most significant impact will be an
intangible one-to enlarge the export ambitions and
enhance the confidence of Canadian manufacturers.
Honourable senators, Canada remains a staunch supporter
of the GATT. We have taken a leadership role in the Uruguay
Round; moreover, Canada hosted the mid-term ministerial
meeting in Montreal earlier this month. That meeting showed
how painfuîly slow negotiations are at the multilateral level.
Progress was made-indeed, agreement was reached in ten or
eleven sectors; but this seems to be stalled now because of the
deadlock on agricultural matters between the European Economic Community and the United States.
For the purposes of today's debate, and especially in the
light of discussions of the Free Trade Agreement during the
election campaign, I think it is important to note that the Free
Trade Agreement with the United States strengthens Canada's
bargaining position under the GATT. In previous rounds of

SENATE DEBATES
SENATE DEBATES
multilateral trade negotiations the Most important part of the
process was the deal between Canada and the United States.
We are the largest trading partners in the world; we are the
two countries with the most at stake. Under the GATT rules
the deal reached between Canada and the U.S. automatically
benefited other countries, whetber or not they had made
concessions to us. The Free Trade Agreement means that
Canada will flot have to pay multilaterally for what we have
already obtained bilaterally from the United States. The Europeans, the Japanese and the newly industrialized countries will
now have to make concessions for improved access to the U.S.
and Canadian markets. That increases Canada's bargaining
power to achieve improved access to their markets.
Honourable senators, from September 1985, when the
Prime Minister announced the government's free trade initiative, to November 1988, when the election was held-and even
since the election-the opposition to the negotiations that led
to the agreement became ever more strident and extreme. If
the Free Trade Agreement went ahead, we were told, Canada
would lose its political sovereignty. ht would lose its cultural
identity. Medicare would disappear; unemployment insurance
would go. We would lose our ability to protect our environment. We would lose the right to enact effective regional
development programs. Canadian energy resources would be
defenceless against the voracious United States appetite.
* 1450)

Honourable senators, four or five years from now, ten or
twenty years from now, when we stili have our Medicare and
our social programs, when Our political and cultural identities
are stronger than ever, when the sky has not fallen, when the
Canadian economy. at the very least, has proven to be a net
winner from free trade, these arguments advanced by the
opponents of the Free Trade Agreement will look pretty
foolish.
Senator Frith: îrnfot "when". "If" is the word.
[Translation]
Senator Murray: We are convinced that the Free Trade
Agreement will benefit Canada, just as the lowering of trade
barriers with the United States over the past 50 years bas
benefited Canada.
We believe that this agreement will help us adapt to the new
international realities, whether they result in a lowering or
raising of trade barriers.
We are convinced that with the other elements of the
Government program. Free Trade will help us administer this
change for the benefit of Canada; and that is what the
Canadian people have again asked the government to do.
[English]
Honourable senators, this is a good agreement and a good
bill. This is a good agreement in which Canada, as a smaller
partner gaining access to a larger market, is a winner. lt places
the largest bilateral trading relationship in the world on a
sounder basis. As the leaders of the industrialized nations said
in their communiqué when they met in Toronto last summer. it
sets an example for future multilateral trading agreements. It
[Scnator Mrj

December 27. 1988

provides the opportunity for Canada to increase incomes,
employment and living standards throughout the country and
it builds the foundation upon which Canada will prosper and
excel in the world of the future.
I have no hesitation in commending this agreement and this
bill with great enthusiasm to the support of honourable
senators.
Hon. Allan J. MacEachen (Leader of the Opposition):
Honourable senators, the Leader of the Government alluded to
a statement made by the leaders of the industrialized nations
that the Free Trade Agreement between Canada and the
United States would set an example for the multilateral trade
negotiations and would act as a catalyst. I cannot fail to say
how wrong they are, because the first important event in the
multilateral trade negotiations, namely, the Montreal conference. failed miserably. even though the example had been set
by the Canada-U.S. Free Trade Agreement, in the words of
the industrial leaders.
No more obdurate opponents to the liberalization of trade in
Montreal were there than some of those leaders who paid this
tribute to the Canada-U.S. Free Trade Agreement.
Senator Murray: Aren't you glad we did not put ail our eggs
in that basket?
Senator MacEachen: Honourable senators. we have heard
ad nauseam that the conclusion of a Free Trade Agreement
between Canada and the United States would constitute a
breakthrough and set an example for the multilateral trade
negotiations. We have been told that, as the Leader of the
Government said, by Mrs. Thatcher, President Mitterrand and
the head of the European Economic Commission. We have
been told by the President of the United States to get this done
and it wiIl bc a catalyst. It had its test in Montreal and it
failed miserably.
Somne Hon. Senators: Hear, hear!
Senator MacEachen: That is my first point. That has been
characteristic of the debate on the Free Trade Agreement.
There have been dlaims and assertions that are flot justified
and wilI flot bejustified by experience.
However. 1 could flot fail to make that point, because I was
watching the GATT ministerial meeting to find out whether
indeed the new spirit that was alleged to have developed would
influence the decision-makers in Montreal. It did flot of
course. because the divisions between the United States and
Europe are so deep that nothing that happens between Canada
and the United States has any effect on them. In any event,
that is something by way of a more pointed introduction than 1
had intended originally.
As the Leader of the Government bas already told us, we
have before the Senate for the second time legislation to
implement the Canada-U.S. Free Trade Agreement. It bas
just been rammed through the House of Commons by a series
of closure motions at every stage. Now, in the Senate, we are
asked to give expeditious treatment to this bihl.

SENATE DEBATES

SENATE DEBATES

In July of this year, when it -became apparent that the
government intended ta pusb Bill C-130 through bath Houses
of Parliament without giving Canadians an appartunity ta
express their views, Liberal senators agreed that Canadians
ought ta be given an opportunity ta participate in what had
become a national debate on our country's future. It was a
decision that flowed directiy from the government's determination ta exciude Canadians from this important process.
Had the government shown confidence in its poiicy at that
time, had it shown confidence in the judgment af the Canadian
people, it would have sought a mandate from Canadians
before asking Parilament to give final approvai ta the agreement. In reiusing ta do so, on an issue that the Prime Minister
described as an -historic new departure" and on which he had
himself reversed bis position, the government invited action by
the Senate. We decided ta withhold aur appravai of the second
reading ai Bill C-130 sa that the Canadjan people might have
an apportunity ta make a judgment. In accardance with the
bargain which was implicit in that decision, ai course we
intend ta acquiesce ta the resuits ai the electian and ta the
majority decisian af the House ai Commons.
It is warth recailing that the Prime Minister caied the
Senate action at the time a "violation af one oi the mast
fundamental precepts ai British parliamentary demacracy."
He said that the appointed Senate. was being caiied upon "ta
hijack the most fundamental rights af the Canadian Hause ai
Cammons." Much af the press initiaiiy took a similar view. An
Ottawa Citizen editarjal characterized it as an "abuse of
parliamentary demaocracy." The Globe and Mail questioned
the constitutionai right ai the Senate ta take any such action.
*

(1500)

1 do not intend ta review in any tharoughness the press
reactian ta the Senate's position, but 1 wiil recali the comments which appeared in the Montreal Gazette, which show
haw wrong bath the press and politicians can be about public
opinion and haw irequentiy they misread the attitudes af the
Canadian people.
This series ai comments in the Montreal Gazette reads as
foliows:
The Senate, Senate reiorm. Senate iegitimacy. wili be
factors in the election probabiy at least as important as
iree trade.
The issue af free trade does not iend itseli ta an election
that is at the same time a kind ai referendum. for the
simple reason that people do not care enaugh about free
trade and rightiy so.
AIli ai us discovered that people did care about free trade.
Polis showed that, far from condemning the Senate, Canadians
in fact supported the decisions taken by the Liberai Senate.
An Angus Reid pol reieased in the final week af Juiy
showed that 58 per cent af Canadians approved ai what was
being done by the Senate. Other poils taken in August showed
that Canadians approved-by margins ai 55 per cent ta 33 per
cent; 47 per cent ta 27 per cent; and 52 per cent ta 30 per
cent-of the actions taken by the Senate ai Canada, through

its Liberai majarity, in giving the people ai Canada an opportunity ta express their views.
0f course, it is truc that the opinion ai the press changed;
even the Prime Minister had a siight change ai heart. The
Prime Minister stopped bis scathing criticism af the Senate,
and on August 1l, 1988, called upon the Senate ta change its
stand with the following soathing words.

Some Hon. Senators: Hear, bear!
Senator MacEachen: We shouid have them emblazoned
upon aur office walls as a reminder when the next thunderboit
from the Prime Minister descends upan aur heads. He said:
It is up ta the Senate ai Canada now ta display that
independence ofijudgment and the intelligence and discretian for which they have been, irom timne ta time,
knawn ...
Sonie Hon. Senators: Hear, hear!

Senator MacEachen:
(The Senate) is independent ai the House ai Commons,
it doesn't fallow directives of the people af the House af
Commons ...

Senator Doody: Except Mr. Turner!
Senator MacEachen:
Sa traditionaliy, the Senate hasn't responded ta any specific requests for directives from leaders ai parties ta
subvert any ai aur constitutionai practices. Sa we'hi just
sc what the Senate does.
Weil, we know what the Senate did. But we do know that
even in mid-August the Prime Minister was hoping ta have the
implementing legislation passed and given Rayai Assent without iacing the judgment of Canadians. As time ran out,
however, the Prime Minister finaliy iaced the inevitabie and
calied bis electian. We are naw again dealing with the impIementing legisiatian at second reading, aiter having had a mare
extended debate about the Senate in aur second reading
discussion in September. That is ail I intend to say about the
Senate.
As the Leader ai the Government bas said, Bill C-2 is
virtuaily identicai ta the former Bill C-130. It might be
appropriate ta pick up the debate where we leit it in this
chamber a few months ago.
Hanourable senatars, even though we intend ta acquiesce
and aliow the bill ta become iaw, it does not ioiiow-certainiy
nat in my case-that aur concerns with respect ta this legislatian have disappeared. They still remain, perhaps even more
acutehy at the presenit time because ai the failure of the
government ta deai with themr adequately-not anly in the
election but also in the course ai the second reading debate in
this chamber.
ln that debate last September Senator Roblin, supported by
Senator Murray, iound much ta compiain about in my arguments concerning the energy provisions ai the Free Trade
Agreement. Perhaps they had diificuity in understanding my
points; perhaps it was my own failing ta convey them clearly. I

SENATE DEBATES
SENATE DEBATES
thought I had put them clearty enough for bath of them ta
understand. But what disturbs me about the response af the
gavernment is the singular lack of understanding of the provisions af the agreement revealed by their cammnents.
Let me first af ail deai with the powers of the National
Energy Board. Referring ta my speech, Senatar Roblin said:
He made the statement that the National Energy
Board would be the ane that decided whether the propartionality clause in the treaty would be invaked.
I do flot know where that alleged statement originated. It was
certainly flot fram my speech. Indeed, I said just the opposite.
I do flot want that misunderstanding--certainly in the mmnd af
Senatar Roblin-to continue ar ta be shared by any other
senatar.
The thrust of my argument was that the powers of the NER
had been inappropriately constrained. I said that "~The Free
Trade Agreement remaves from the National Energy Board its
independent status as a regulatory agency." 1 further said:
The National Energy Board is no longer free ta deny an
export licence and apply a surplus test . .. It must go ta
the governiment, ta the mînister. The minister, if he
wishes, then goes ta the Governor in Council. The Gavernor in Council or the minister are free ta let the request
from the National Energy Board sit there, in which case it
will lapse.
If the gaverniment, even today, has a quarrel with that
statement, it also has a quarrel with the National Energy
Board chairman. On the occasion of the hearings before the
Standing Senate Committee on Foreign Affairs on September
27 of this year 1 referred ta a stituation in which the National
Energy Board had concluded that it would have ta deny an
expart licence requested by an applicant. I put it ta the
chairman of the National Energy Board, by way of a question,
that "at that point the board would flot be able ta take
independent action and deny the licence for reasons of security." Mr. Priddle replied:
Senator MacEachen is right. The board could not act
on its own volition.
I made the point clearly and correctly in my speech of
September 13, 1988. The National Energy Board has lost
these powers under the new section 84 of Bill C-2. These
powers have been transferred ta the government. It is the
goverfiment, flot the board, which decides whether ta deny a
licence, and thus trigger proportionality.
I regret that Senator Roblin is flot present today, but I
would certainly like ta know whether he agrees with me and
Mr. Priddle on this point.
e(1510)
But that is flot the only reasan I regret that Senator Roblin
is flot present today, because his confusion or misunderstanding went even deeper when he challenged my statements
concerning supply shortages and the International Energy
Agency commitments. Senator Roblin's remark, as he put it,
that ". .. there is anly one kind of shartage in an international
trading palicy .. "indicates that he has failed ta understand

December 27, 1988
December 27. 1988

the difference between section 83 of the National Energy
Board Act and chapter IV of the 1974 International Energy
Pragram. I raise this matter again. because under the provisions of the Free Trade Agreement Canada has undertaken
particular responsibilities ta share its' ail with the United
States in a period of restriction, which the governiment itself
must introduce if a licence ta expart is denied. I came back ta
this matter, because it has been alleged sa frequently, repeated
again by Senator Roblin and repeated by officiaIs before the
committee, that we should flot worry about this matter or pay
any attention ta it because what we have undertaken in the
Free Trade Agreement is the same thing, and even less aneraus than those obligations which we have undertaken in the
International Energy Program. I find that inaccurate. It is a
misunderstanding which can only be circulated because of lack
of attention ta the Free Trade Agreement or because of an
effort ta glass over what is of real cancerfi ta those of us who
have examined the energy provisions of the Free Trade
Agreement.
Let me just point out that section 83 of the National Energy
Board Act spelîs out the consideratians which the National
Energy Board must take into account in passing judgment an
an expart licence application. The National Energy Board
must satisfy itself that the quantity of ail, gas or power ta be
exparted does flot exceed-and here 1 quote the act itself. .. the surplus remaining after due allowance has been made
for the reasonably foreseeable requirements for use in Canada." Under section 83 of the act as it is presently written the
National Energy Board has the power ta reject a request for
an expart licence if, on the basis of the board's sale judgment,
foreseeable supply is fia greater than foreseeable Canadian
requirements-or, ta put it another way, if the foreseeable
supply falîs short of a surplus.
On the other hand, chapter IV of the International Energy
Program defines the circumstances in which its demand,
restraint and allocation provisions are triggered in order ta
create common, emergency, self-sufficiency in ail supplies. It is
clear from the list of factors triggering the international
program that what is anticipated is a sharp, quick and abrupt
disruption of international oil supplies. I hope it will be clear
that section 83 of the National Iznergy Board Act, which is ta
be modified, and chapter IV of the International Energy
Program are concerned with different situations. One is concerned with the foreseeable future-the middle term, so ta
speak; the other is concerned with an abrupt, unforeseeable
disruption. Under section 83, which is ta be amended, the
NEB has discretionary powers ta deny export licences, On the
other hand, the trigger under the international agreement is
virtually automatic; it leaves no discretion ta the Canadian
goverfiment, as we can reasanably assume that the government
will meet its obligations under that agreement. That is why,
honourable senatars, I cannot agree with the assertion that
there is only one kind of shortage in an international trading
policy. I have made the distinction between middle-term availability and short supply an the anc hand and abrupt disrup-

lions on the other in order to bring out in what respects the
Free Trade Agreement creates new obligations for Canada.
Honourable senators, I shall go on 10 make another point. 1
should Iike t0 say with respect to section 83 of the National
Energy Board Act that 1 hope no one wîll contest that licences
for export to the United States of America can no longer be
denied by the Canadian government without triggering a
period of restriction in Canada and the application of the rule
of proportionaliîy. Yet the Leader of the Government, Senator
Murray, was shocked when I said that the energy provisions of
the agreement limit Canadian freedom of action. He said. and
I quote:
That statement is not only bard t0 say; il is untrue.
Honourable senators, I believe 1 have made that illustration
now, that we have limited our freedom of action even if only
on one point, namely, that we cannot deny an export licence to
the United States without declaring a period of restriction,
which is new, and witbout imposing proporîionaliîy, whicb is
also new. Honourable senators, that is certainly a diminution
of Canadian freedom of action.
May I go on furtber 10 say that 1really did not need Senator
Murray's assertion 10 understand that we do not have any
supply commitment t0 the United States under the energy
provisions of the Free Trade Agreement. However, in a period
of restraint, 1 can envision market conditions in wbich shortages in the United States could produce higb oil and gas prices
in that country wbich Canadian bidders migbî not be able 10
meel. I can aiso foresee the possibility of a situation in wbich
Canadian gas supplies t0 the United States are locked mbt
long-term conîracîs, Ieaving precious little for Canadians to
bld on.
Honourable senators, 1 should still like bo press tbis point
and ask Senator Murray if be is still of the view that we have
made no concession on energy to the United States. I would
like 10 ask Senator Murray if be holds tbe view tbat Article
904 of the Free Trade Agreement creates no obligations on
Canada. If not, 1 really would like to know bis analysis, and t0
know wbere 1 bave gone astray in saying that limitations have
been placed on Canadian freedom of action.
Cerîainly, honourable senators, the United States is of the
opinion that tbey bave made major gains. Perhaps 1 have
already referred in the Senate to this incident, but a few
months or weeks ago 1 attended a meeting whicb was
addresssed by the chairman of the President's Council of
Economic Advisors. In a discussion of the Canada-U.S. Fre
Trade Agreement the single benefit ciîed by the chairman as
baving been achieved by the United States was access by tbe
United States t0 Canadian energy supplies. Not only bas tbat
been given, tbrougb a series of measures in the energy sector,
but we bave severely, ini my opinion, constrained our freedom
of action.
Honourable senators, at tbe risk of boring my colleagues, I
intend t0 return to the comparison between the International
Energy Agency and the Free Trade Agreement. 1 do 50
because I tbînk it will become an important issue for Canadi-

ans in the future. At some point in lime people will bc
scrambling to discover how we got ourselves into tbis parlicular obligation under the Free Trade Agreement.
* 1520)

I said in my speech last September:
lb is neither accurate nor relevant to compare the obligation that we are undertaking with the United States t0
obligations we bave undertaken under the International
Energy Agency ... Tbe comparision wiîh the InternationaI Energy Agency is a red herring.
Senator Roblin was sbocked, and 1 believe that Senator
Murray was shocked. if tbey bad looked at the international
program under the International Energy Agency they would
have known Ibat that program deals solely with oil. Article
904 of the Free Trade Agreement deals witb aIl] forms of
energy. We bave therefore assumed new obligations in îerms
of broader coverage over and above those contained in the
international agreement. Secondly, tbe circumsîances îriggering tbe International Energy Program are narrow and tigbtly
defined. Tbey reflect a sharp disruption of world supplies.
However, circumsîances in wbich tbe restraint and proportionaliîy disposition of Article 904 may be triggered are mucb
broader. We bave therefore assumed in tbe Free Trade Agreement new obligations in îerms of tbe range of applicability
over tbose contained in the International Energy Agreement.
Wbaî Senator Roblin did understand properly was a situation in wbicb an international energy crisis triggered the
provisions of chapter IV, in whicb the international program
would take precedence. Wbaî bie failed 10 understand was a
situation of crisis falling short of îriggering the provisions
conîained in chapter IV of tbe International Energy Progam.
In these circumsîances the International Energy Program
would not be operative, but restrictions and proportionaliîy
provisions under the Free Trade Agreement could be.
Senator Roblin made mucb of the scenarios presented by
officiaIs in the commiîîee in what I can only describe as a
gallant effort to help the governmenî in Ibis situation. They
constructed their scenarios on the basis of a hypoîbetical
international emergency situation in oil supply in wbich botb
the international program and the proportionaliîy provisions
would be in effect. This bypoîbesis, by definition, excludes the
situation witb wbich I was dealing-tbat is, a situation in
wbicb proportionality alone is in force, possibly on a commodity other than oil. That is wby reference to the IEA in sucb
circumstances is truly a red berring. The experts did not fudge
the books, as Senator Roblin put il; tbey fudged the issue, and
Senator Roblin felI for il!
Honourable senators, we on our side bave bad some discussion, whicb we bave sbared informally with members opposite,
to the effect that in the examination of Ibis bill in committee
we would be doing a real service to the better undersîanding of
the bill, and we would hetter grasp the differences in the field
of energy beîween our obligations under the Free Trade
Agreement and our obligations under the International Energy
Program, if we could bring before the committee a person

SENATE DEBATES
from the International Energy Agency, so that we could seule
this dispute and so that, when events occurred, we would know
precisely our obligations. In other words. we would be looking
to the future rather than looking back. I certainly hope we can
select that area as one of the sectors for examination in the
committee hearings.
I want to say a word about agriculture, if I may. and I want
to repeat to some extent the argument I made in September,
when I said that the Free Trade Agreement would have an
unfavourable impact on the future of our supply management
system. In particular, I questioned the continued viability of
our marketing boards under a system where our food processors, purchasing their inputs from farmers under a regime of
higher prices, would compete head to head with goods from
the United States whose ingredients were supplied by farmers
operating in a non-regulated, non-supply management system.
That is the issue. I cited the testimony before our Foreign
Affairs Committee of John Pigott of the poultry industry, Mr.
Fleischmann of the grocery manufacturers and Mr. McLean
of McCain Foods Limited, aIl of whom spoke of the danger of
being caught in the middle between a regulated and unregulated market-the regulated market in Canada and the
unregulated market in the United States. where supply management systems are more the exception than the rule.
In their speeches Senator Roblin and Senator Murray
intimated that such criticism made in the committee hearings
by such witnesses was indicative of a hidden agenda by
Canadian food processors; namely, the destruction of our
marketing boards. Senator Murray said:
Mr. McLean is opposed to marketing boards. That is
what he wants to do; he wants to get rid of marketing
boards.
Senator Roblin said:
... the real target was the marketing board system . . .
They do not like it. They would like it changed and they
want pressure brought on the people who use the marketing boards to bring their prices down.
What is noticeable about the reply of both my colleagues
opposite is that, rather than dealing in a coherent fashion with
the arguments put forward by these individuals, Senators
Murray and Roblin chose to attack their motives. In fact.
Senator Roblin said:
. . . we should be careful about accepting the testimony of

these gentlemen who, quite properly, have a self-interest
to express.
Of course they have an interest. That is why they were called
before the committee. Would Senator Roblin have preferred
that the committee elicit the testimony of disinterested parties? Perhaps we should have asked the steel producers to
discuss the position of the Egg Marketing Agency under free
trade.
Senator Barootes: Or the consumers.
Senator MacEachen: The reason for this line of argument
by government spokesmen-that is, their focus on motives
rather than on reasons-is their inability to deal with the
jSenator Maci:achen.j

December 27, 1988

following key question: How are you going to ensure that
Canadian food processors get their raw materials at the same
prices as their U.S. competitors? I would be most interested in
hearing an answer to this question during the course of our
debate. Of course, we have ail been told in soothing words not
to worry. Senator Murray tried to assure us that ail was well
with our supplv management system. and he even went so far
as to say, "Even Mr. McLean has stated that he expects
McCain Foods to continue to grow and prosper . ..
* (1530)

For the record, when he appeared before our committee,
Mr. McLean said:
The only way we can survive is by hammering our
Canadian wage earners to take lower wages . . . McCain

Foods will survive and thrive with or without the deal. We
can go south, but our factory workers and our farmers
cannot. The only way that those farmers will survive
under the deal as it is written is if they take lower wages.
Of course, what is basically at issue before the Senate, the
House of Commons and the Canadian people is not the future
of McCain Foods. If McCain Foods opens factories in the
United States and survives and thrives there, it may bring joy
to McCain Foods and to the government, but it will be of little
comfort to Canadian farmers and workers who will be left
behind.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear!
Senator MacEachen: In a sense, we are just opening up the
subject of agriculture in our discussion and, unfortunately, I
agree with Senator Murray that much of the debate in the
election campaign was extreme and strident on both sides and
we got damned few answers from the government to basic
questions in the course of the campaign. The questions raised
by the food processors in our committee were not adequately
dealt with.
Senator Murray introduced me to another area of concern
when, in the course of his speech, he said:
... for processors of dairy products, we have added ice
cream, yogurt and a number of minor dairy products to
the import controls. Therefore, the impact on the food
processing industry will be positive.
Yes, we did put ice cream and yogurt on our import control
list, but just recently the American government asked the
GATT Council in Brussels to establish a panel to examine
Canadian restrictions on ice cream and yogurt imports. What
has happened to the spirit of the FTA? They are challenging
the Canadian addition of these items to the import control list.
The GATT Council accepted the American request and a
panel is now being established.
The Canadian government could respond by asking for a
GATT panel to examine the onerous restrictions the Americans have themselves placed on ice cream imports. Canada
cannot export any ice cream into the United States whatsoever. We have no quota. If we do ask for our own panel, and
assuming both challenges to the GATT are successful, what
will the impact be for Canada? Will the impact be positive?

December 27,1988

SENATE DEBATES
SENATE DEBATES

We know that American producers do not operate under the
same strict supply-management system that exists in Canada.
We know that raw milk prices in the United States are 25 per
cent to 30 per cent lower than in Canada. Raw milk is the
major ingredient of ice cream. Canadian processors are protected by a 17 per cent tariff on ice cream, but under the FTA,
of course, it will be eliminated. So we will have a level playing
field, a playing field where Canadian processors will not be
able to compete on price because of the much higher cost of
their major ingredient; and you will not find any major ice
cream producer being able to remain competitive if it is
required to source milk at the higher supply-management-system price. This will put tremendous pressure on the marketing
boards to cut their prices for raw milk, with the alternative
being a decrease in sales volume for the dairy farmer.
Of course the story does not end there. If the United States
is successful before the GATT panel, the inevitable consequence will be that the European Economic Community will
immediately challenge our use of the import control list to
restrict the importation of their cheese. The European Economic Community has long complained about our restrictions
on their cheese products and would certainly not hesitate to
initiate their own action against our use of the import control
list, particularly if a successful challenge by the United States
established a useful precedent.
We know, honourable senators, that the import control list
is critical for the maintenance of our agricultural supply-management system. The terms of the FTA and the American
challenge before the GATT could very well prove to be lethal
blows.
Senator Murray states that his government has protected
marketing boards in the Free Trade Agreeement. Yes, that is
true; the words are in the agreement; however, the objective
economic conditions, the economic forces that will be
unleashed under the terms of the agreement despite the words
will put enormous pressure on these boards.
Honourable senators, I am making the effort to say what I
feel deeply; namely, that we are at the beginning of this
process. The bill may be passed in some days and become the
law of the land, but we will be dealing with the forces that
have been unleashed by the agreement and aIl I can say is that
I have not as yet had any answers to the dilemma that was
posed before the committee and was posed, I think, in the
minds of many farmers in the course of the election campaign.
Senator Murray referred to a list of allegations that were
made in the course of the campaign-the dire consequences
that were said would take place if the agreement were effected. I did not make any arguments in the campaign that I have
not made in the Senate, and I have not had any answers that
satisfy me as to the concerns of the impact of this agreement.
That is one reason why the work of the Senate may just be
beginning: We have to follow this and monitor it and know
about the consequences. There is no more important area than
the potential relationship, for example, between Canadian
social programs and the Free Trade Agreement. We all know
that many questions were asked during the campaign and we

know that there are still some questions left unanswered, but
which will deserve careful scrutiny in the future.
In my comments in the Senate last September I did not deal
with the possible relationship between Canadian social programs and the Free Trade Agreement, especially the disputesettlement provisions of the Free Trade Agreement. I want to
touch on that subject now, certainly not in the detail it
deserves but at least to raise in your minds some questions as
to whether it is unreasonable to suggest that the social programs of Canada are left unprotected or will be put under
pressure as a result of the Free Trade Agreement.
However, while I shall touch on these subjects, I shall not do
so in detail. For example, I shall postpone until later discussion
of Articles 1402 and 1602 of the Free Trade Agreement,
which allow some 45 different types of U.S. health and social
service management enterprises to operate in Canada as
though they were Canadian, and discussion of the implications
such a development might have on Canada's health system.
We ought to discuss that at some future point in the Senate.
However, I shall deal with a more general threat to Canadian
social programs which will arise as a result of what can be
termed a systemic pressure. That will be, in a sense, an
insidious process, because it will happen gradually and it will
take the form not of a direct attack on Canadian social
programs but of an assertion of the necessity for Canadian
competitors to have a "level playing field" and not to have
burdens imposed in the form of social payments that are not
carried by their American competitors. That is where the
systemic pressure will come, and we had better be aware of it.
* (1540)

We know there are no provisions in the Free Trade Agreement covering social programs directly. Of course, that is
deliberate, because exemptions were obtained in some areas.
The government missed its best chance to tie the hands of the
U.S. government in the upcoming negotiations on subsidies.
We do know that in the next five to seven years the question of
subsidies will be among the most important areas of negotiation. That is where the question of social programs and
subsidies will be dealt with. That question is still on the table,
and it will be on the table in the course of those negotiations
for the length of time they take.
The systemic pressure I have mentioned has begun, with a
number of Canadian businessmen already indicating that they
are very concerned about the costs they bear as a result of
social programs. In many cases the U.S. competition is not
obliged to pay for the equivalent of these Canadian programs.
With the Americans calling for a level playing field, and with
Canadian manufacturers at a disadvantage, pressure is bound
to occur either to alter or to refuse to improve Canadian social
programs.
Let me give you a few illustrations of pressures that existed
in anv event but that will get renewed momentum as a result
of the circumstances created by the Free Trade Agreement.
For example. the Grocery Products Manufacturers of Canada
stated last year that "some product sectors in Canada are at a
disadvantage ... some fundamental realignment in legislated

SEN ATE DEBA TES
benefits programs and labour union organization will be
required. As well, Canadian workers' income expectations will
have to be substantially lowered."
The Gazette reported just last week that the Canadian
Manufacturers' Association called for "a commission to study
social programs with an eye to cutting the $28 billion federal
deficit." Perhaps the basic agenda is to equalize costs with
their American competitors, something that is now becoming
so critical under the Free Trade Agreement. Those are some of
the indications that lead me to say that, although we are
prepared to let the bill pass, we have not heard the end of this
subject and it has not been settled at all.
The Government of Canada will be caught in a vise, whose
jaws are Canadian business on one side and American business
on the other. The pressure will be in the direction of squeezing
life out of some existing or future social programs in Canada.
That is the systemic pressure about which I talked. It is not
in the agreement, and it is irrelevant to say that since it is not
in the agreement there is nothing that will happen that will
affect our social programs.
Senator Frith: It should be in the agreement.
Senator MacEachen: Bear in mind, honourable senators,
that Canadian social programs will also-I do not know which
word I want to use to make it responsible and non-pejorativebut Canadian social programs will be, let us say, under
question from direct attacks by American firms in competition. These direct attacks will take the form of charges that
social payments in Canada are subsidies to the Canadian
producer or manufacturer or supplier or whatever. That is how
our social programs will come in: by the allegation that they
are subsidies and therefore countervailable.
I was deeply interested to read an article published by the
former Deputy Trade Negotiator, Mr. Gordon Ritchie, in the
Globe and Mail on November 14, 1988. Mr. Ritchie, at the
height of the debate on the relationship between the Free
Trade Agreement and social programs, took it upon himself to
come to the defence, let us say, of the government, or of the
Free Trade Agreement. I suggest that honourable senators get
that article and read it. It is worth reflecting upon. To me, its
basic thesis is startling, and that is that the binational panels
under the Free Trade Agreement will, in the future, be the
guardians, the final defence against the erosion of our social
programs. Mr. Ritchie presents what is meant to be a repudiation of charges that Canadian social programs are at risk
under the FTA, and he develops two scenarios.
In the first the United States would misapply their laws to
call Medicare a subsidy. According to Mr. Ritchie, this is not
really a problem, because Canada could simply force the U.S.
to appear before a binational panel which, in his words,
"would have no choice but to find that the Americans had
acted wrongly and to order them to drop their case." At first I
found it to be a reassuring comment that there was a method
by which we could stop the Americans if they said, "That is a
subsidy." However, it is not that simple; not that simple at all.
Under Article 1904 of the Free Trade Agreement, before the
[Senator MacEachen.]

December 27. 1988

question of whether or not Medicare is a subsidy would ever
get to a binational panel, it would have been dealt with by the
U.S. International Trade Administration, which would have
ruled that Canadian Medicare was a subsidy. That is the
process. In order to get to the binational panel it would have to
be ruled to be a subsidy by the International Trade Administration. Of course, by reason of his argument. Mr. Ritchie,
implicitly if not explicitly, acknowledges that a U.S. trade
tribunal could find that Medicare is a subsidy. That in itself
should be put in the back of your heads. Who, then, rules in
this case as to whether a judgment of the International Trade
Administration is a correct one? It is a binational panel.
Mr. Ritchie says of course the panel would find that it is not
a subsidy; but how can you be sure? There are five members
on the binational panel; at least two of them are American,
two of them are Canadian and, I think, the fifth is jointly
agreed to, and I think most of them are lawyers.
*

(1550)

Senator Barootes: You don't need lawyers if the decision is
already made.
Senator MacEachen: I am saying that, in order to get to the
binational panel in a case of this kind, the U.S. International
Trade Administration would have to rule that Medicare in
Canada constitutes a subsidy.
Senator Flynn: On what basis?
Senator MacEachen: That is something you had better ask
Mr. Ritchie, because he has already acknowledged in his
articleSenator Flynn: It exists in the United States.
Senator MacEachen: -the possibility that a U.S. trade
tribunal would find Medicare a subsidy. I find that
disquieting.
Senator Barootes: You cannet have a guaranteed decision
and also have the panel vote.
Senator MacEachen: I find startling that ai a certain point
we are relying on binational panels to protect our Medicare.
This is what Mr. Ritchie, as the second in command of the
negotiations, tells us about binational panels, a good portion of
which is made up of non-Canadians.
But let me take you to another scenario that Mr. Ritchie
presents, and that scenario is where the Americans change
their laws so as to "pretend somehow that universal social
programs were subsidies". Again the Canadian Deputy Trade
Negotiator, referring to the procedures provided for in section
1903 of the FTA, points out that, when the issue came before
a binational panel, the panel would again have no choice but to
rule in Canada's favor and issue a binding order to the U.S. to
drop their case. That, too, is a beguiling proposition, although
it is not true. There is no binding order. There is no order ai
all. In such circumstances all that the panel could do would be
to issue a declaratory opinion. The U.S. would be free to
ignore this opinion, and Canada's only recourse would be
either to take comparable legislative action or equivalent
executive action or tear up the deal. So this facile solution that

December 27. 1988

December 27. 1988

SENATE DEBATES

SENATE DEBATES

appeared in the article is certainily a far cry irom what it
appeared to bc on first blush.
1 must admit, honourable senators, that it takes some carefui referring back and forth and cross-referencing to understand how these panels operate. But, leaving aside the comnplicated specifics, 1 was appalled when it dawned upon me
what the essence of Mr. Ritchie's argument was. His argument
flot only exposes the inherent weaknesses of the panel system
but it States that in the final analysis the sole protection in the
way of an erasian ai social programs in Canada is a five-member panel of lawyers, at least two of which are American. and
whose conclusions are unpredictable, to say the Ieast. If they
are independent binational panels, they will decide according
to their own likes.
We have heard Mr. Ritchie before the committee and I
would regard him as a very authoritative commentator. His
analysis clearly proclaims ta me that the gavernment has dealt
away its role as the sole protector of social programns. Parliament no longer stands as the guardian of social programns
iorged over the years aiter long debates and bitter opposition.
The supreme guardian now for Canadians is the binational
panel. *"Don't worry," says the Deputy Trade Negotiatar,
"because the binational panels are bound ta find in a way that
you would like," but 1am flot convinced.
1 want ta make one or two iurther points about dispute-settlement, because even today the Leader of the Government in
the Senate said that the dispute-settlement mechanism was a
shield, was the pratectar. raising in my mind the samne line of
argument used by Mr. Ritchie. 1 have raised serious concernis
previously today about the dispute-settlement process.
As you know, the Prime Minister made a big deal out of this
section. He said in his speech to the House of Commons last
August:
Most fundamentaily and importantiy, the agreement wiil
replace the poiitics of trade with the rule of iaw.
1 have dealt with Article 1903, which deals with changes ta
antidumping and countervailing duty iaws, and 1 have already
expiained the problemns that i foresee in that area. 1 turn now
ta Article 1904, which pravides a procedure for the review ai
final antidumping or countervailing duty orders. As honourable senators know, these final orders would emanate from the
United States ITC or the International Trade Administration
ai the U.S. Department ai Commerce. ACter the order is
made, one of twa possible courses ai action is ioliowed,
depending on the order. If the final order is not in Canada's
favour, then Canada can demand a review by a binational
panel whose findings are binding. Ironically, problems arise if
the final order is in Canada's favour. Such an order would
mean that the American plaintiff, presumably a producing
campany. would have lost its case before the American
authorities.
At this point the best possible course ai action for the
plaintiff ta follow is ta wait 30 days, after which the binational
panel review cannot be requested. The piaintifi would then do
as it had always done before the existence af the FTA; that is,

it wauld appeal the final order before the U.S. Court of
Appeal.
Canada has losi ail contrai over the events. Obviously there
would be no reason for Canada ta request a panel review in the
30-day period since it wauld have won its case. Simiiarly, the
U.S. government wauld cîearîy flot want ta appeal the ruling
of its awn ITC or ITA before the panel. In ail cases where
final orders are in Canada's favour it loses contraI and, indeed,
appears ta have lost any aileged advantage. It is disappointing
ta observe that any final order revised as a result af a judicial
appeal cannat be reviewed by a panel. Canada has fia right ai
appeal.
I am prepared ta have athers who have mare expertise than
i tell me that I have made a mistake along the way. But if I
am right, think for a minute af the consequences af this
pracedure with a Canadian social pragram as an example.
After an American court had ruled, based on American law,
that a Canadian social program was a subsidy, Canada wauld
have no recaurse whatsoever but ta suffer the cansequefices ai
a trade penalty. That is how I have approached the question ai
social programs, and I believe that I am coveriflg the terrain
which was laid before us by Mr. Ritchie, and i would like ta
get some answers.
a

Honourable senatars, as far as 1 am concerned, the Free
Trade Agreement wili become the law ai Canada. As I have
already said, that does flot mean that it is ail over; it is the
beginning ai an important future process. Therefore, I want ta
say a word about iooking ahead rather than loaking back and
refighting the election campaign.
Honourable senators, I have deait with a numnber oi leatures
ai this bill, but there are others that wili require scrutiny in
committee. Personally, I deplore many ai these features ai the
legisiation, let alone the way in which the agreement was
negotiated. The time has came ta look forward, ta prepare for
its imrplementation and ta bring ta account those responsible
for its operation.
Senator Murray accused me on September 15 iast ai iaîling
ta weigh the costs and benefits ai the agreement or its advantages or disadvantages ta the nation as a whole. Well, that was
a strange complaint coming irom the spokesman for a goverfiment that has been addicted ta generalities and prane ta
advertising excessive benefits, ta avaiding explanations and ta
remaining silent an the casts.
The Free Trade Agreement as it is naw is not more than
hall a design. The other hall stili has ta be negotiated, and, I
presumne, paid for. Ves, one day we wiIi be in a better position
ta weigh the casts and benefits, but that wili be when the
design is complete, when the full house wili have been built. In
the meantime the government has set far itseif an impressive

with other ancillary negotiatians, with the United States. The

agreement. The real issue is whether the government wiii live

SENNATE DEBATES
SENATE DEBATES

December27. 1988

up to its own agenda, complete the Free Trade Agreement and
deliver to Canada the benefits it has so vocally advertised.
Honourable senators, the Free Trade Agreement provides
for no less than 18 new sets of negotiations to be carried out
between Canada and the United States. In addition, consultations leading to possible negotiated revisions of the agreement
and to harmonization are foreseen in seven different fields.
Some of these involve provincial interests and jurisdictions and
would, presumably, call for negotiations with provincial governments. In view of the length of time I have taken today, for
which I apologize, I shall not go over the full list of these,
which any reader of the agreement can easily put together for
himself or herself.
Honourable senators, that is Canada's side of the matter.
Also of interest is the range of subjects over which the
American administration intends to draw Canada into negotiations, over and above the negotiations already provided for in
the Free Trade Agreement. Here again I shall only give
illustrations drawn from the U.S. Statement of Administrative
Action which was tabled in Congress by President Reagan on
July 25, 1988.
First are the negotiations on changes to rules of origin, in
response to changes in the Canadian MFN tariff. Second are
the negotations of plywood standards. Third are the negotiations for the elimination on a global basis of ail subsidies
which distort agricultural trade. Fourth are the negotiations
for the exclusion of the United States from transportation
rates established under the Western Grains Transportation
Act. Fifth are the negotiations for quantitative limits on
Canadian potato trade. Sixth are the negotiations on automobiles to increase Canadian content to at least 60 per cent to
qualify for FTA treatment. Seventh are the negotiations on the
liberalization of investment rules, including the elimination of
direct investment screening, the extension of the agreement
provisions to energy and cultural industries and the elimination of technology transfer requirements and performance
requirements, el cetera. Eighth are the negotiations to bring
financial services disputes under the dispute- settlement provisions of the Free Trade Agreement.
These illustrations, which are by no means exhaustive, give
us a clear view of the American agenda. Without anticipating
the outcome of ail of these negotiations, we have to assume
that, in order to launch the Free Trade Agreement on a
cooperative course, this agenda will also have to become the
Canadian agenda.

hard information on how these negotiations will be conducted.
What is the time frame? How do these negotiations relate to
the GATT negotiations? Will one sort come before the other?
What is our definition of an appropriate subsidy? Have we
prepared ourselves in this regard?
The Americans have high expectations surrounding this set
of negotiations. The Americans interpret Articles 1906 and
1907 as contemplating the replacement of the provisions of
chapter 19 of the agreement by a new system of rules dealing
with subsidies and unfair pricing practices. Bear in mind that
the binational panel provisions are part of chapter 19. which is
to be replaced. The meaning of this is made crystal clear in the
American Statement of Administrative Action. The President
maintains that:
the binational panel review system is intended to be an
interim procedure.
He wants to remove Senator Murray's shield.
This vital piece in the Canadian government's case is
regarded by the Americans as a transitional measure. The new
system of rules that our negotiators failed to negotiate in the
first round must now be put together in the second round. The
Americans have had the courtesy to give to us their position,
their wishes and their objectives. I quote from the same
document:
The Administration has no higher priority than the elimination of Canadian subsidies.
They also describe their negotiating objective as:
... obtaining increased and more effective discipline on
Canadian government subsidies, including subsidies provided by Canadian provincial governments.
What is at stake, honourable senators, is clearly the fate of
the agreement. If these negotiations do not succeed, we are
back to square one with respect to the American trade remedy
laws.
Honourable senators, I do not know what the government's
negotiating stance will be. I do know that it has given up a lot
to get a half-way house. Determining what its stance is will be
a task for the future. Suffice it to say that in a transitional
period calling for a lot of difficult adjustments the government
has left to be negotiated the most critical part of the free trade
arrangement-the application of American trade remedy laws
to Canadian exports. It has left a large gaping hole-the
absence of any set of rules for determining whether or not
adjustment programs are countervailable.

The stand taken by the American administration in these
follow-up negotiations should be of greater concern to us than
vague statements on the overall level of protectionism in the
United States. The American list constitutes a request list, and
how to deal with it should be uppermost in our minds and on
our government's agenda.
Of al] these follow-up negotiations, none will be more
important than the one on the definition of subsidies and
unfair practices under Articles 1906 and 1907 of the agreement. In committee we hope that we will obtain some good,

[Senator MacEachen.]

In order to make a judgment on the overall balance we shall
therefore have to monitor in the future both the way in which
the interim arrangements work and progress made in negotiating a definitive system. That monitoring job can effectively be
done by a committee. Certainly the Senate should participate
by means of a committee.
We want to ask questions in the committee of Mr. de
Grandpré, if possible, who has been singled out and appointed
by the government to head up a commission on the question of

adjustment. How far have they gone? Is it unfair to ask now
what the plans are for the future in the field of adjustment?
We know that the experience of other free trade areas bas
dernonstrated that adjustment is best pursued in periods of
economic expansion. Economic stagnation, let alone a downturn, increases the pain and endangers the success of this
venture. Wbat good will it do to retrain displaced workers if
they have no other jobs to turn to? What good will it do to
encourage firms to look at tbe promised land if bigb interest
rates stifle their growtb? The governrnent's rnacroeconomlic
management will be part of rnaking the free trade area work.
The government has made a choice. Tbe government has
chosen tbe bard discipline of tbe rnarket. We shall bave to
monitor bow the market does tbe job, bow the governiment
deals witb its budget deficit, bow it copes witb interest rates
and excbange rates, bow it reconciles its commitrnt to
preserve intact our social prograrns and regional development
programs witb the imperative of negotiating with the Americans a definitive system on subsidies.
So far our discussions bave focused, quite appropriately 1
believe, on tbe text of an incomplete agreemnent. This examination will no doubt continue for sorne years, but we now bave an
additional task, that of monitoring and passing judgment on
action and reaction under tbe agreement. We sball bave to
establish reporting requirernents and an institutional framnework, enabling us to pass judgrnent on its multidimensional
and systemic effects. Yes, we should bave an overview and we
sbould corne in due course to pass a global judgment on the
Free Trade Agreemnent. Otberwise, small events may occur,
always falling sbort of a national crisis. One plant closing is
not a national crisis, but small events will occur. Tbe country
will drift from one pragmnatic decision to another. It will be
ternpted by opportunism and move frorn one concession to
anotber, until ail] tbe King's men no longer can, or even know
bow to, put tbe country togetber again.
Hon. Jack Austin: Honourable senators, my first words
must be to Senator MacEachen, witb tbanks for an excellent
outhine of the current factual basis on wbicb tbis legislation is
proposed to, us. 1 would adopt bis argument by reference, as 1
arn sure would al members on tbis side of tbe bouse.
This particular day will find few Canadians focused on this
Senate debate regarding Bill C-2, an act to implernent tbe
Free Trade Agreement between Canada and tbe United States
of Amrneica. It is the holiday season for Canadians and tbey
are rîghtly concerned witb the more immediate matters of
farnily, friends, relîgious feelings, a general stock-taking of tbe
year now concluding and tbe challenges tbey may face in the
year ahead.
Nonetheless, ail of us in this Senate chamber know tbat
Canadians bave focused keenly on the underlying issues of tbis
bill and will do so again and again in the years to corne. AIl of
us know that this is no ordinary bill that cornes before us for a
few days and is then passed into the hands of bureaucrats to
play a circumspect noIe in the lives of a few Canadians. We are
universally aware that this is a pivotaI act in the life of oun

nation, an irretrievable step toward some future we can understand but dimly and on wbicb we do not agnee.
Many Canadians-a majority of 57 per cent in the election
beld Novemben 21, I 988-voted for the Liberal Party or tbe
New Democratic Party. and tberefore against tbe principle of
this bill. Only 43 per cent voted for the Progressive Conservative Party and to maintain this bill.
We need no lessons in this Senate chamber on the principles
of representative govennment. By oun paniamentary rules and
conventions tbe Progressive Conservative Party has, witb 43
per cent of tbe populan vote, won a majority in tbe otber place
and, witb it, a parliamentary mandate to proceed witb tbis
legislation. Howeven. the knowledge that a majonity of Canadians bave cast tbeir ballots against this legislation must surely
serve to caution the government tbat wbat it bas won is rnerely
a conditional victory.
Canadians will day by day sec tbe emerging evidence of tbe
wisdorn, if any, of tbe governrnent's policy and, in tbe ligbt of
experience, know whetber the Prime Minister's leap of faitb
bas a soft landing or will corne with a bard and darnaging joît.
If tbis is tbe wrong way to go, if Mr. Mulroney bas bet tbe
nation on a rnuch too costly deal, tbe price will be paid not
only by birn and bis party but, regrettably, by countless men
and wornen across Canada who will be injured, some of tbern
catastropbically.
It is because tbe rnajority of Canadians bave voted against
tbis bill tbat the opposition in tbe Senate chamber and in tbe
other place bave a special responsibility to bold the govennment to its assurances and comrnitrnents and to the expectations that it bas created in bringing this pivotaI issue fonward
in its prescrnt forrn at this tirne. The process of this debate bas
great value for the future accountability of the government.
Botb here and in tbe otber place tbe specific statements; of tbe
Prime Minister and other members of bis cabinet made pnior
to and during the election are being placed in the parliamentary record, to be noted and referred to in tirnes ahead.
We bave been given wonds of assurance frorn the governrnent that Canada's social security safety net, pensions, unemployrnent insurance, Medicare and family allowances are not
in any way tbe subject of or affected by tbis legislation. Tbere
are similar assurances given with respect to regional development policies and the prograrns relating to, education and job
retraîning. Otber assurances bave been given regarding our
very important water resources. We are told tbat the agreement and this bill are so favourable to Canada and to Canadian workers that no special provisions need to be made for
industries, communities and individuals affected by new levels
of competition and cbanging economic circurnstances. The
preserit day prognarns will do, the government assures us.
It is the role of the Senate today to do its work and to
discbarge its nesponsibility to sec that Canadians are given tbe
opportunity to understand the nature and rneaning of the
government's proposaIs for their well-being. If I rnay indulge
in a bit of year-end stock-taking, I would say that we bave
performed very well indeed in tbe last Parliament in discbarg-

SENATE DEBATES

ing these duties. In particular. in matters such as government
spending, revenues to the pharmaceutical industry. immigration and refugees, and affirmative action for women in
employment we have shown that the government's position
differed from the public interest, and Canadians have responded by involving themselves more and more in our proceedings
and frequently appealing to us to take a strong stand. We have
donc so for regional interests, minority communities and
individual rights, particularly in the interests of national
well-being.
We have distinguished ourselves most. however, by insisting
in the last Parliament on behalf of ail Canadians that the
predecessor to this bill be submitted to the people to decide.
That was our proper role and carried constitutional legitimacy
and precedent. It was in keeping with our role as a political
court of last resort. Here was legislation presented by a
government that had as its policy the deliberate purpose of
non-explanation and non-debate. We are ail aware of the 1985
memorandum to Cabinet, which argued-presciently, as it
turns out-that the more the Canadian people knew of the
trade deal the less they would like it. The memorandum went
on to argue that the presentation should be kept generai and
vague. Sell it on the "touchy-feely' sentiments of free trade,
the memo said. "Don't get into specifics, or Canadians would
focus on the cost side of deal and reject it," said the memo.
"Just talk about the good parts. Don't let Canadians make a
balanced assessment," decided the government. Of course, the
government could justify this approach, because it knew what
was good for the Canadian people more than Canadians could
grasp for themselves. Well, that is where the Senate has its
responsibility: to make sure that the government is required to
explain itself and tojustify its purposes.

(1620)

This bill was not understood and not well explained. We
asked that the government seek a mandate before proceeding
and, in so doing, demonstrated our own role as legislators of
final resort. We spoke for a majority of Canadians, as their
vote in the election demonstrated. That the Senate decision
was a correct one in the eyes of the Canadian people was
shown by the fact that our decision not to pass the bill in the
last Parliament was never raised as an issue in the election but,
rather, was accepted by the Canadian people to be right.
The government sought a mandate not because it wished to
do so but because it had no choice. Even so, the Prime
Minister and his Cabinet tried to avoid debating the issues and
telling Canadians the risk side of the agreement to Canada's
sovereignty and to the lives of individual Canadians in agriculture, services and manufacturing.
h want to honour the Leader of the Liberal Party, the Right
Honourable John Turner, for his performance in the last
election in finally forcing the government to offer some
account to Canadians. Mr. Turner's work in the TV debates of
October 24 and 25 captured the attention of Canadians and
brought about an assessment of the issues across this country
the like of which has not been seen for a long time. Canadians
came face to face with their deeper feelings and understanding
[Senator Austin.]

December 27. 1988
December 27. 1988

about being Canadian. They re-examined their attachment to
this precious community of people, this precious geography we
call Canada. The result was a strengthening of ail that is
Canada. John Turner played a crucial role in this renewed
understanding and has found a proud place in our history.
Canadians. by voting 57 per cent against this bill, showed that
they understood the issues and were concerned.
I have said that through the representative system of government as practised within the Canadian Constitution and its
Conventions the Progressive Conservative Party won a conditional victory. But the Canadian jury is out on this legislation,
as Senator MacEachen has said. It is out on its desirability for
Canada, and the government has a considerable task to bring
about the benefits that it has promised the Canadian people.
My chief concerns regarding this bill are not with the
principle of free trade but with the great shortcomings of its
achievement in the Canada-United States agreement and in
this implementing legislation. Canada is a leading worid trading nation, second to West Germany in the percentage of GDP
earned from foreign trade. Everyone knows that Canada and
the United States are the two greatest trading partners in the
world, exchanging over $150 billion of goods and services
between them. Open markets, liberalized trade and fair currency exchange practices are vital to Canada's well-being. We
have been leading members of the GATT processes and are
working assiduously in the current Uruguay Round. We have
been active exponents of more generous north-south commerce, and through the UNCTAD process and international
bank support and through CIDA, in ail of which the Honourable Allan MacEachen played a significant role in his years as
Secretary of State for External Affairs, we have sought a more
universal commerce among nations.
Personally, i favour a real, effective and equitable free trade
relationship between Canada and the United States. This bill
falls far short of what is required. This bill falls far short of
what the Prime Minister, in 1985, 1986 and 1987, said was
required. You will remember his objectives at the time.
First, that no deal would be concluded unless there was a
removal of ail constraints, tariffs, antidumping duties and
those "Oh! So special" U.S. rules of countervail. Second, that
there would be a specific definition of fair trade practices, or
subsidies, that would clearly exclude from U.S. trade action
the essential social programs that have made Canada the
country we are proud to be. Third, that there would be a
dispute-settiement tribunal, which would apply agreed-upon
trade rules to the practices of trading entities and of government agencies.
Those were not criteria imposed on the Prime Minister.
They were, as he once knew, the essential objectives of any
trade deal for Canada. They were essential to provide fairness
between two countries that are not, and never will be, equal
trading partners. The United States is ten or twenty times our
size, depending on the statistics chosen. It is a worid superpower with interests and responsibilities beyond our terms of
reference. In any such trade agreement we needed, and should

December 27, 1988

DEBATES

have required, asymmetrical terms ta safeguard aur essential
interests.
The Right Honourabie Pierre Trudeau once said in a speech
ta the National Press Club in Washington that. when a mouse
lies down with an elephant, the mouse is sensitive to every
tremar and movement of the elephant and sleeps very poarly
indeed. Can you imagine what the relationship would be like if
the elephant turned amorous?
It is fact that the Prime Minister achieved none of the three
goals 1 have set out. Nonetheless, he concluded this arrangement that is before us and wiil take his place in aur history on
the wisdom ai that decision-a leap of faith through a window
of oppartunity, ta use twa phrases that the Prime Minister has
employed, although 1 admit that he did nat use them together.
What is the haste in entering into this agreement? We have
heard about U.S. protectianism and the need ta shield aurselves fram it, but nothing in the agreement bars the U.S. fram
applying its pratectionist laws ta Canada. The Omnibus Trade
Bill passed by the U.S. Cangress in the summer ai 1988
applies ta Canada as it applies ta the world. Canada was flot
exempted there and is flot exempted by this agreement
either.
One suspects a political agenda, with a focus on the next
election, and flot a nation-building agenda here. In logic and
experience, fia deal should have been concluded withaut the
major criteria that 1 have mentioned. The time frame ai
national interest is a much langer ane than that ai any pahitical
party. It would have been no shame, and ta greater national
credit, ta admit that the negatiations were wrongiy cast or had
miscarried than ta conclude a deal ta Canada's permanent
impairment. There is an ancient wisdom recalled: "Deal in
haste-repent at leisure."
Some will know that 1 piayed a raIe as Deputy Minister ai
Energy, Mines and Resources in the years 1970 ta 1974 in the
shaping ai the energy policies of Canada in that period. 1
mention this because the energy-reiated provisions of this
agreement and bill concern me greatly. In the world energy
crisis ai 1973-74 the need for Canada ta ensure a high degree
ai energy scli-suificiency came home ta the Canadian people
as neyer before. Parts ai Canada dependent on international
suppiy-the Atlantic provinces and Quebec-sufiered actual
diminishment ai suppiy and patential disruption of their
ecanamies. Many parts ai the world, but fartunately flot
Canada ta the same dcgree. saw warld price escalation and the
immediate release ai galloping inflation. The Liberal gaverfiment ai the day. under Prime Minister Trudeau, took important steps ta develop supply suficiency and were rewarded
with the confidence ai the Canadian people in the 1974
election.
Today the energy warld is iacing unrealistically low priccs
for ail, given the costs ai production and the avaiiability ai
other sources ai energy. The international market was distortcd by OPEC action and disagreement and by the factors ai
war in the Middle East. The decline in price has seriousiy
interrupted aur palicies ai seli-sufiiciency bath in exploration
and in conservation. Much ai aur conventianal cost ail and gas

is known, and aur conventianal ail in particular is a deciining
resaurce in which we are no longer seli-suificient.
Our longcr-tcrm seii-suificiency wiil depend an acccssing
the much higher cast Arctic, Hibernia, Scotia Sheli and ail
sands depasits in western Canada. We must maintain aur
effort towards deveiopment. But, as 1 have said. these are
castly resaurces, and because ai the nature ai markets they
cannat be justified by investar activity alone. A competitive
investar rate ai return is just flot availabie. This means that
governments must, for national security and develapment reasons, stimulatc these prospects. That in turn means the taxpayers ai Canada will be asked ta do a large share ai the work.
*(1630)

Through this so-calicd Free Trade Agreement we have given
national treatment ta U.S. citizens and corporations with
respect to supplies ai ail and gas produced in Canada. By this 1
mean national treatment as ta access and national treatment
as ta cost. Why the trade agreement, which is based an
lowering tarifis, refers ta encrgy access and cast is another
story which will be dcalt with at the appropriate time.
My point is that in agreeing ta access and cost at thc same
market price that Canadians pay we will place a high burden
an Canadian taxpayers ta subsîdize American cansumers ai
Canadian ail and gas. Canadian taxpayers wiil pay for the
unecanamic portion ai the exploration and deveiopment that
wiIi take place, and that is understandabie if Canadians have
at least guaranteed their security ai supply. But American
consumers wili pay oniy the market price. They wili have
security ai supply at no cast ta them. It is easy ta understand
why the U.S. negatiatars exempted pctroieum develapment
subsidies from a very long iist ai unfair trade subsidies.
If thcre is ta be any iairness for Canadians in aur ane-way
energy trade ai the future with the United States, the goverfiment must sec ta it that U.S. taxpayers are invoived ta same
important degree in ensuring their future access ta Canadian
energy resources. Withaut that measure, the provisions ai this
aspect ai the agreement alone wauid justify the use ai the
six-months canceliation clause and ail ai the failout that that
wouid portend. The cast ta Canadians ai this aspect alone ai
the agreement is in the muitibillions ai dollars.
1join with Senator MacEachen and many ai my coileagues
on this side in praposing that the Senate estabiish a specific
raie for itseli in monitoring the consequences ai this legislation. There are baund ta be many unintended and unfortunate
resuits. as well as resuits ta the disadvantage ai Canada that
we can foresce. The Senate must provide a forum for Canadians ta be heard and for the consequences ai this legisiation ta
be assessed. We must aiso keep under view the criticai negatiations which are ahead, particuiariy in the definition ai subsidies and other trade practices which Senator MacEachen has
outiined. Somewhere alang the way we must review the highiy
unfortunate soitwoad lumber issue, which has had such a
seriaus impact an the cast-base ai aur iorest industry in British
Calumbia. Here was a case where U.S. builying was toa
intimidating for the Mulroney government ta deal with, and,

unfortunately, there is nothing in this agreement to prevent the
same thing from happening again.
As I represent British Columbia in this Parliament, i cannot
deal with trade without a reminder to the Senate of the Pacific
dimension to this country. The Pacific Rim is a dynamic
region of the world-its fastest growing region in economic
terms. It is a fact, as pointed out in a recent series on
immigration in the Vancouver Sun, that 50 per cent of new
Canadians are now coming from the Pacific Rim. Canada's
role in the Pacific has been largely ad hoc. That approach
must be changed. We must develop and act on a comprehensive strategy for trade and for our overail relationship. There is
a growing recognition of the need for the creation of a "Pacific
Coalition", to give it the name Senator Bill Bradley of New
Jersey coined in a speech on December 8, 1988, to the
Economic Club of New York. He proposed a new international
organization in which the nations of the Pacific would join to
promote trade and economic growth. Canada would be well
served to consider this objective, similar to one proposed by
Secretary of State Shultz in Bangkok last April. Indeed, we
should be among the initiators of such a group.
In conclusion, honourable senators, the government has its
mandate, and on that basis, and on the responsibility of the
Prime Minister, this bill will pass. The government has won a
battie, but the issue is far from settled. For my part, the most I
can bear to do is to abstain from defeating this bill, but I
cannot refrain from believing that it is not to the advantage of
Canada.
Hon. Finlay MacDonald: Honourable senators, I should like
to ask Senator Austin a question. After hearing the high
quality and obvious preparation made by the previous speakers, i was hoping that we would not be subjected to future
speakers making references to the fact that the majority of
Canadians voted against this legislation. I would suggest to
Senator Austin that he has absolutely no way of proving that
particular point. He might, however, help me by telling me
when was the last time in this century that a party in this
country, with a three-party system, received 50 per cent of the
vote. Also, if he has perhaps analysed the results of the last
election, Senator Austin might also tell me how many people
voted for the Liberals or for the NDP and did so because they
did not like Brian Mulroney, or because they did not like the
pharmaceutical bill or because they did not like submarines, or
a host of other things.
Senator Frith: How about the Prime Minister, in a submarine, taking a pill?
Senator MacDonald: Perhaps Senator Austin, if he can,
would explain those things to me. I say to Senator Austin that
a man of his experience and background should not make
statements that he cannot back up.
Senator Austin: It would take a reasonable man, Senator
MacDonald-and I hope I am that-to make the statements I
have made. Also a reasonable man such as yourself, Senator
MacDonald, may differ with me. In the meantime, I wish you
a Merry Christmas.
[Senator Austin.]

December 27, 1988
December 27. 1988

Hon. Sidney L. Buckwold: Honourable senators. Senator
MacDonald might be interested to know that i, in common
with most other senators. have received literally hundreds of
letters, telegrams and phone calls with respect to the issue of
free trade. In those communications the comment is often
made that the majority of Canadians voted against the government and that the Senate should now act on behalf of that
majority. To that comment my response is, and will always be,
that the Senate asked for an expression of opinion by the
people of Canada. That expression was given; the government
was returned with a majority. and that is the way in which the
system works. The government won the battle; it is now their
bail game, and. although I did promise to rise and say a few
words in the Senate, I have to acknowledge the responsibility
of the government to carry the bill. That sentiment has been, i
think, expressed very clearly by our leader, Senator MacEachen, in his preliminary remarks this afternoon.
Therefore, honourable senators, what I have to say is perhaps not so much a résumé of ail of the arguments we have
heard, pro and con, with respect to the Free Trade Agreement
and this bill-although one cannot help but point out a few of
the most disastrous effects that some of us foresee-as it is a
look ahead. Perhaps it is more appropriate to look ahead at
some of the problems that will face us as a result of this
legislation.
Honourable senators, I gladly and freely admit that at one
time I supported the concept of free trade. As a matter of fact,
i stili do on the basis of the philosophy of free trade, although
perhaps that is a platitude. However, I began to have my first
doubts when we started into consideration of Bill C-22. During
that debate I saw the power of the American pharmaceutical
lobby moving in and using, for the first time, that famous
phrase, the "level playing field". To those of my colleagues
who have forgotten or who are unfamiliar with Bill C-22Senator Barootes: How could we forget, since you have
reminded us?
Senator Buckwold: Senator Barootes, i know you have a
long memory. However, there are some new senators who may
not be familiar with the contents of Bill C-22. That bill deait
with the removal of some forms of generic competition from
patentholders of pharmaceutical drugs. However, as we travelled around the country and listened to discussion of Bill C-22
supported by the pharmaceutical industry, it did not take any
great genius-you did not have to be an Einstein-to realize
where the initial impetus for this iniquitous legislation came
from. Although it was denied time and time again, nevertheless-and i think that even most of those on the other side
would agree-there was that push from the powerful American lobby of the pharmaceutical industry in Washington,
which moved in and said to Mr. Mulroney, "Mr. Mulroney, if
you want this deal, you had better clean up your act on
competition in drugs." That was my first awakening.

(1640)

Then, as a member of the Banking, Trade and Commerce
Committee, along with Senator Finlay MacDonald and others,
I crossed the country hearing representations on the imposition

December 27, 1988

DEBATES

of duties on shakes and shingles by tbe American government
because of supposedly unfair competition irom Canada. The
stumpage fees Ievied by the provinces in the industry were flot
high enough ta satisfy tbe industry in the U.S., wbich at the
time was really non-competitive. Again, as 1 travelled across
the country Iistening ta the pros and cons of tbat particular
debate, 1 could flot belp but be impressed with the power of
American lobbies in Washington and, in tbis case particularly,
of American legisiators, American senators, wbo were able ta
convince the decision-makers that the competition was unfair,
ihat we in Canada were iaking advaniage of our American
friends in ibis way.
Then, as a senator from Saskatcbewan, 1 saw tbe power of
ihe American lobbies when tbey brought a dumping charge
against Saskatchewan potasb. That initiative was undertaken
by îwo American senators from New Mexico, where the
American potash mines are Iocated, represenîing an indusiry
thai ai tbe time was burnt out and used up. 1 had visiîed
Carlsbad, New Mexico, and seen ibeir mines. There was very
little ore left. As a matter of fact, the original poîash invesiors
who came îa Saskatchewan, wbicb bas tbe largest poiasb
reserves in tbe world, were from New Mexico. 1 bad visited the
mines in New Mexico as a guesi of the Poiasb Company of
America during my days as tbe mayor of Saskatoon. As 1 said,
tbere was litile leit. However, îwo American senators from
New Mexico had enougb power îo say ibai tbe Saskatchewan
potasb indusiry was dumping, ibati h was underselling ibeir
market and puiting tbem oui of business. Again, my eyes were
opened.
Tbe nexi incident also occurred in my own province; il
involved uranium. Tbe American lobbyisîs for a relatively
inefficient uranium industry were able îo geî duies invoked
againsi the uranium industry af Saskatcbewan, whicb has by
far the bigbesî grade uranium ore in the world. Once again 1
saw tbe power of American lobbies.
If anyone in ibis country feels tbai sucb incidents wiIl flot
occur again, iben 1 ibink be bad better go back ta scbool. Tbe
ability ta impose counitervail duties is ibere, and il will continue io be ibere. The dispute-settlement mecbanism, altbougb
admiitedly an improvement, really does nat salve any prablems. It bas no legal canstitutional power. Tbis body will look
ai situations, but you can believe me, and yau can believe ail
tbe aibers wbo know the situation mucb beiter iban 1, wben 1
say that, as the years unfald and as American industry
becomes even sligbily burt, the issue af countervail will be
raised by the Americans-and as well by Canadians, because
we are flot particularly innocent cubher-mn variaus situations. 1
draw ibese incidents ta tbe attention of my colleagues ta
indicate tbe very seriaus problems ibat we face abead.
1 sball flot go through wbai bas already been said about
energy as it affects my province. Cerîainly producers in Alberta and Saskatcbewan are happy, but it is shorî-îerm gain for
long-ierm pain. We will be paying for iî for a long lime.
because we bave given away anc af aur greatesi national
advantages, aur energy, in a world wbere in due course energy

will become a major factor in tbe economic survival and
prosperity af nations.
Let me naw turn ta aur agricultural indusîry. I bave heard
tbe Premier ai Saskatcbewan, whom 1 respect and wbo fully
supports ibis deal, say ta tbe farmers of Saskatcbewan, -Wc
bave a million people in ibis province and we are going ta bave
open ta us tbe United States witb a population ai 250 million."
He bas said ta the farmers thai the border walls will be down
and îbey will prasper as neyer before. By tbe way, tbe farmers
did nat faîl for ibai line. Tbey are flot quite that gullible; ihey
are no langer bayseeds. Tbe farmers realized the situation
wben they wenî across tbe barder and saw ibeir farm friends
fram Nartb Dakota, wbo were just as bard up as tbe farmers
ai Saskatcbewan in spite ai the faci tbai ibey bad this market
witb a population ai 250 million siîîing ibere. That market
does not seem ta bave added ta ibeir prosperity.
Our Saskatchewan industries were also îald ibat tbe irade
barriers would came down and tbat ihey would be able ta
mave tbeir products over tbe border. Same time ago I îook a
car trip from Saskatoon ta Sali Lake City, Utab. We weni
tbrougb Nortb Dakota, Soutb Dakota, Montana and Idaho.
Ail tbe way down I did not see anc cîty in tbat great market ai
250 million peaple bal as big as Saskatoon. 1 pass ibis
information on ta illusîrate, ibat tbe prasperity ibat bas been
adverîised is a long way away for a gaod pari ai Canada.
Our agnicultural indusîry bas same real fears. Let me quate
irom a receni article in tbe FinancialPost:
For Canadian consumers, tbe Super Duper supermarket ini Buffalo, N.Y., is an eye-apening revelatian ai wbaî
grocery sbopping migbî be like under free irade.
There, anly a two-baur drive from Toronta, a half-galIon batîle (nearly twa litres) ai 2% milk selîs for US89e
and roast cbicken for only US79e a pound.
Acrass tbe border, wbere more tban 230,000 Canadians
work in the $50-billion grocery praducts indusiry, ii's a
differeni sîary. A litre ai milk is C$1 .30 and roasi cbickens cosi up ta C$2 a paund.
Tbase lawer U.S.-style prices are a iantalizing prospect
for Canadians. But some observers fear tbey could cosi
bundreds ai food indusîry jobs as the Canada-U.S. fret
trade deal is pbased in over the nexi decade.
Tbaî article was prinîed by a publication thai is a strong
supparter ai free trade. 1 think we bave ta be aware ai ibese
kinds ai ihings. Tbe article poses nothing new. We beard
similar cammenîs during tbe eleciion campaign. 1 tbink ibai,
as bas been pointed oui so well by Senatar MacEachen and
Senator Austin, more than ever we must concentrate on wbat
happens iram tbis point an.
One ai my major cancerns is over the future ai aur excbange
rate. We have nat had very mucb discussion in ibis free trade
debate abaut the relative value ai tbe Canadian and American
currencies. Wben we bad a 71-cent or 72-ceni dollar, Canadian industry was really doing well. We were one of the greatesi
bargain countries for American campanies ta buy irom, and it
was mare difficult for Canadians ta buy American goods. 1

operate my own business. Whereas my company was normally
a very large importer of American products, the change in the
Canadian exchange rate wiped out that advantage and our
buying was basically concentrated on Canadian milîs. Witb
the Canadian dollar at 83 cents, that situation bas changed
quite dramatically. American agents are swarming into Canada-and into the Canadian econamy. They are booking orders
by becoming very competitive. What 1 arn saying ta my
colleagues is that the greatest non-tariff barrier or advantage.
whichever way yau want ta look at it, is the excbange rate.
1 have asked some of our senior people about this and they
have tald me nat ta worry, that the situation will adjust itself,
but, as 1 read it, some econamists feel that because of a
weakness in the American dollar in the world market the
Canadian dollar will do as it already bas, ta the surprise of
many, and continue ta rise. If we get up ta a 90-cent or a
95-cent Canadjan dollar, which has traditianally been the
relationship of aur currencies, the very same companies that
paid out contributions of hundreds of thousands of dollars ta
chambers of commerce during this last election campaign ta
advertise the benefits of free trade ta Canadians will be
knocking an the doors of the Minister of Trade and Commerce
and athers saying, "Please do something ta protect us." They
will use the very same reason for demanding tariffs that they
used in the early days of Canadian industry.
It is very tricky ta try ta relate that exchange rate if the
gavernment turns araund and says. 'Through a variety af
means, including the Bank of Canada, we will make sure that
we have a dollar well below the American dollar, which gives
us an advantage af up to 20, 25 or 30 per cent." That is a
majar advantage in terms af a free trade deal, but, if we lase
that, 1 predict that there will be calamity in many industries af
this country.
1 laok at, far example, free trade in terms of the farm
machinery business. Virtually, we have had free trade in that
business since 1944. We used ta have here in Canada ane af
the greatest farm machinery manufacturing industries in the
whale world. Massey Ferguson was one af the great examples.
With the introduction of free trade there was a fairly steady,
graduaI erosian af that industry until, today, there is not ane
majar manufacturer of farm machinery in this whale country.
It is true that there are some small manufacturers producing
specialized items, and that might belp in terms of free trade,
but aur great farm machinery industry, which provided thausands of jobs acrass this country, bas disappeared. There are
some wbo say that a contributing factor ta that disappearance
was the Free Trade Agreement.
After that agreement, we were tald how farmers wauld get
the very lowest prices in the warld because we bad free trade
with the Americans an farm macbinery. I wauld ask any one
of my agricultural friends whether tbey tbink they have lawprice farm equipment in camparison ta other parts of the
warld. Again, I pass this an ta my colleagues ta indicate same
of the problems we should look at in this respect.

We have seven years ta harmonize aur variaus pragrams,
such as aur social pragrams. our cultural programs and our
subsidy pragrams. The word -'harmonize- is defined in the
agreement as "making identicalX Honourable senators. -making identical" is a very difficult thing' ta do. It reminds me
somewhat of the story of the fellow who married a girl wha
bad an identical twin. To the surprise of everyane. the sisterin-law moved in witb the newly-married couple. Shortly afterwards ane of bis friends asked, "Witb your sister-in-law, the
identical twin. living witb you, how can you tell wbo is your
wife and wbo is yaur sister-in-law?- To that be replied, -Ta
tell yau the trutb, I can't, but that is their problemn."
Some Hon. Senators: Oh, oh!
Senator Buckwold: Honourable senators, I suggest ta yau
that this so-called -making identical" will create a problem,
and nat just for the sister-in-law but for aIl Canadians. wben
we try ta barmonize the kind of pragrams that bave made
Canada wbat it is today.
Hanaurable senators, 1 acknawledge the mandate the government bas been given. Our responsbility now is ta make sure
that this agreement works as well as it possibly can. I beartily
endorse the recammendation of aur leader, Senator MacFachen, that a Senate cammittee shauld have an ongoing
responsbility ta monitor wbat goes on and ta see that wbat we
do is in complete "harmonization"-if you will allow me that
word again-with what bas been said and with wbat is in the
agreement.
I farecast that it will be a difficult task ta complete the
so-called "barmanization" of aIl the subsidies and ather programs in this country with those of the U.S. ta make tbem
completely identical aver the next seven years, and it is my
hope that senators, thraugh a special cammittee, wilI have a
cammitment ta make a contribution in that regard.
Having said that, may I extend my best wisbes ta fellow
senatars for a happy New Year. I hope the years abead will be
as happy for the government as this one bas been, but I would
suggest that, if tbey tbink tbey bad problems in the past, when
they came ta negotiate witb aur American friends in terms of a
so-called "barmanizatian" tbey wiIl look back an 1988 as a
vintage year.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear!
Hon. WiIIie Adams: Hanourable senators, althougb I do not

Senator Austin baw many people vated in favour of free trade

peoples have inhabited that area for thousands of years. Perhaps with the passage of the Free Trade Agreement we will be
able to proceed further with our land claims, particularly in
view of the Meech Lake Accord. It may even be that the
Americans will take over in our area and deal with our land
claims.
Since the free trade discussions commenced last summer
there has been a stepping up of military exercises in the Arctic,
which is located between the two super powers, the U.S.S.R.
and the U.S.A. The increased presence of military personnel in
the Arctic does indeed cause us some concern. We know that
we do not have a large enough military force to look after
ourselves should we ever have to fight the U.S.S.R. That is
why the American and the Canadian governments seem to be
deciding that in the future the Arctic would be a good place
for a war zone, because it bas such a small population.
*(170)
1 have now been living in Ottawa almost 12 years. Up north
we do not have dividing lines. People are free to live on the
land. That is how they survive. They do not have it divided. In
the south people have their own property, perhaps 60 by 100
feet. People say, -That is my property." When you live in the
nortb you go out on the land and you do not ask who owns the
property. You can go anywhere you want. Some are saying
that in the future, with free trade, we will have to open up the
Arctic more for mining. As an honourable senator said a
moment ago, "They have their own country, the biggest in the
world." Even our own Government of Canada does not know
how large our energy reserves are up in the Northwest Territories. We have energy reserves up there and land for mining.
We have fishing and hopes for tourism in the future. We do
not sc the problem of pollution up there that we sec bere in
the rest of Canada and in the United States. 1 hope that at the
least we understand that we have a country up there.
1 have been a member of the Energy Committee since 1
joined the Senate. 1 understand some of the problems the
Americans have with energy shortages. According to Senator
MacEachen, there is nothing in Bill C-2 that would stop the
Americans from using our energy. We have in the high Arctic
the largest reserve of natural gas in the world. We touched the
tip of it about ten years ago. We have been tapping gas there
for the last fifteen years. In the future, after the Free Trade
Agreement is passed, if the Americans want this gas, they can
take it any time tbey want. 1 have seen the area of the
Beaufort Sea and 1 have seen the results of the last three or
four years since the new government took over, and we have
lost a lot of exploration jobs. According to Senator Murray,
over the next ten years there will be two million jobs created
for the people of Canada. Ten years is a long time to predict
whether the people in Canada will be able to find jobs or not.
Since free trade was first introduced we have already lost
2,000 or 3,000 jobs, especially in Ontario and Quebec.
1 join the other speakers in this bouse wbo are concerned
about free trade and the survival of our country. 1 hope our
government makes sure that further dealings with the Amenicans are donc right and that we do not make any mistakes.

1 should like to tell a little story. In 1942, wben 1 was only
about eight years old and the Second World War was in
progress, 1 was at an American army base where they were
training dog teams. It was very interesting. They would go out
on the land and make trails, using a string of dogs, and work
with some kind of explosives or bombs. They were training the
dogs for use in Europe. The dogs were being trained day and
night. Wben 1 was involved at that time 1 felt 1 was representing my country. Today the dog team is not used any more, nor
will it be in the future because of today's technology. If war
broke out today, nobody would tbink of using dog teams. That
was my experience between 1942 and 1945-training dogs for
the war in Europe. My hope today is that in the future we will
not be living in a war zone, if a third world war should start.
The Inuit people whom I represent are concerned about free
trade. We are concerned about the Americans having access to
things in the Arctic, particularly the unpolluted water.
If free trade is put into effect, I hope that at least it will be
of benefit to ourselves and not only to the Americans.
Hon. Hazen Argue: Honourable senators, 1 wish to say a
few words in this debate. First of ail I want to say that 1
listened with great care to the speech of the Honourable
Senator Murray and also to the speech of my leader, the
Honourable Senator MacEachen, whose speech was wideranging and contained sufficient research material to bc a
source for people studying the various aspects of this Free
Trade Agreement.
1 want to speak this afternoon, if 1 may, as a senator from
western Canada and as a farmer and a person wbo, I believe,
bas some knowledge of the Canadian grain business and of
Canada's accomplisbments over the years in that field.
*(1710)

It is my opinion that our Canadian grain system is one of
the great economic success stories of our time. In recent years
Canadian grain exports have been second in earning foreign
exchange for Canada. Wbile the Americans have complained
for a number of years that their share of the international
grain market was being reduced, the Canadian share of the
international grain market, particularly in wheat and barley,
bas steadily increased. I believe that is a tribute to the
efficiency of the system we bave in place at this time.
1 spoke with a farmer the other day who is a canola
producer. He said, "Hazen, in my opinion the Wheat Board
when handling wheat is a much greater success story than tbe
export achievements in canola." I said, "How is that?" He
said, "Well, we have been producing canola in Canada for
many years, but we have only one major export customer,
Japan, and that is it. Our next customer is in Canada." He
said that in bis opinion if we had the same kind of efficiency in
the canola marketing system as we have in the Wheat Board
system we would have a much wider range of customers. We
bave a system that appeals to our customers. We boast that we
have the best quality wbeat in the world and the best grading
system in the world, and I think our accomplishments prove
that.

SENATE DEBA TES
SENATE DEBATES
I have followed to some extent the GATT discussions on
agricultural subsidies. In my opinion those negotiations will
not be successful, because the European Economic Community, in their common agricultural program, have a system of
built-in subsidies that appeal to and are supported by the very
powerful agricultural communities in their various countries.
So the political power in the European Economic Community
is behind the maintenance of those subsidies.
If you hear what the political powers in the United States
say-l think the rhetoric and the action are sometimes worlds
apart-they are against subsidies. To a large extent the rhetoric in Canada is also against subsidies. There is an inherent
danger present for agriculture in the negotiations that are
about to go forward regarding this trade agreement on agricultural subsidies, because, if we give away what we have built up
over the years, we can give away our total grain marketing
industry in western Canada.
We have already given up and lost the two-price wheat
system, which was worth $227 million last year. That might be
valued at 20 or 25 cents a bushel for wheat. There is great
pressure from the United States for us to dismantle and
remove our transportation subsidies to the railway companies,
which amount to about $700 million a year. This could
amount to another 50 cents a bushel. If you add to 75 cents a
bushel the amount that is involved in dismantling the Western
Grain Stabilization Act or Crop Insurance, should we decide
to do so, then I think our western farmers do not have much
chance of surviving.
I asked the Leader of the Government this afternoon if he
could tell the house when a second announcement would be
made under the Western Grain Stabilization Act, and on
further research I found that this was one of his better days
and one of my poorer days, because the announcement had
been made a month ago. I do not know why I did not catch it
then. Maybe it was the size of the payment. I believe it was
announced three days after the election, and the payment
could not have been too attractive in the minds of the people
who have something to do with those payments. In any event,
it is a very good system, which in this current crop year paid
some $950 million into the western Canadian economy. The
Western Grain Stabilization Act was placed on the statute
books of this country after having been introduced by the
Honourable Otto Lang, and it is a credit to his far sight in
those days.
The crop insurance system, which is a good system and is
supported by Canadian farmers, was introduced by the Honourable Alvin Hamilton. So what we have is a series of
accomplishments; taken together, they are very important to
the continuing efficiency of our grain production and marketing system.
There is a fear among ordinary farmers in western Canada
that American investors will come in and invest in the grain
industry in western Canada to the point where American
companies, not Canadian companies, will have control over
that system. Cargill is present in western Canada in a very
major way and the three western pools are talking about
ISenator Argucj

December 27, 1988
December 27. 1988

amalgamating. One of the reasons they put forward for their
possible amalgamation is that they are afraid that individually
they cannot stand up to the competition of Cargill. Milt Fair,
who is the chief executive officer of the Saskatchewan Wheat
Pool, said that the Cargill Grain Company could buy the three
western wheat pools with their surplus change. So that is a
factor.
When the Canadian government begins negotiating with the
Americans in the days and months ahead on the question of
Canadian subsidies regarding who is investing in the Canadian
grain industry, many people in western Canada, who have
worked long and hard to build up the current grain system,
will be afraid that Cargill, Bungy or Cooke may come in and
take over substantial parts of our grain industry and our
marketing system and may be far more interested in marketing American grain than in marketing Canadian grain. That is
an important concern of the people in western Canada.
Those who have supported the cooperative movement in our
current grain system over the years have believed in cooperatives, and they have built a democratically controlled, farmerowned grain marketing system that is distinctly Canadian. We
have a system that by way of efficiency and export success
takes second place to no other country or system in the world.
President-elect Bush has announced that Clayton Yuetter
will be the new American Secretary of Agriculture. He was
the lead American in the trade negotiations. Approximately 20
year ago I had the privilege of meeting Clayton Yuetter, who
was then on the staff of Secretary of Agriculture Butz. He is a
very able, determined person. In all of the negotiations that
will come about in the future concerning su.bsidies we will need
strong negotiators. They will have to have strong backing from
the Canadian government, and I hope that Parliament and
farm organizations will see to it that the government receives
the message that we want to protect our kind of system,
because we have a good system that is efficient and works in
the interest of Canadian agricultural producers. We should in
no way sacrifice it to the system of any other country.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear!

Hon. Charles McElman: Honourable senators, aside from
Senator Murray. no one has spoken on the Free Trade Agreement from the point of view of the maritime provinces, and I
would like to make a few such comments.
Senator Murray: Senator MacEachen did have a few
remarks to make.
Senator Doody: He was speaking for Canada, though.
Senator McElman: Exactly.
Let me say at the outset that I was raised as, and still am, a
traditional maritime free trader. I should like nothing more at
this point than to be able to say with great enthusiasm that I
support the Free Trade Agreement that has been reached
between Canada and the United States. Maritimers have felt
for many years that the prosperity of our region fell apart
when we were forced into the east-west trading pattern within

December 27, 1988

SENATE DEBATES
SENATE DEBATES

this nation, and I think there is a good bit of fact in that
argument.
Having said that, however, I feel great concern over some
aspects of this Free Trade Agreement, principally-and I do
not need to go into great detail because Senator MacEachen
has donc so-with respect to its treatment of subsidies. I am
especially concerned over the five- to seven-year period in
which negotiations will be undertaken so as to determine what
is a subsidy. I am sure the Leader of the Government understands very well the deep concern on the part of the maritime
provinces over this question. There is a worry that regional
development grants will be considered subsidies by the Americans. If the U.S. were successful in prosecuting that view, it
would be disastrous for Atlantic Canada. I hope that is not the
case, but the concern is there in the maritime provinces.
I believe all of the major industries of the Atlantic area that
export to the United States have experienced involvement in
cases brought by American interests before the International
Trade Commission. Some of these cases were brought forward
sincerely and were settled successfully in favour of the Americans. With respect to others, I think one can say fairly that the
intent was harassment. In some of the latter cases the Americans were successful in their harassment simply because of the
time-consuming aspects of fighting the propositions put before
the ITC and the great costs inherent in these procedures. Even
when the ITC ruled against the Americans, they could be
considered successful.
Maritimers are concerned about the forest industry. Many
of us have always said that when the forest industry is thriving
the whole economy is thriving. Canadians have had a frightening experience over the past two years with the Americans
charging that the level of stumpage fees in Canada constituted
a subsidy. Canadians fought this allegation previously, and
fought it successfully, before the ITC. The Americans recently
wished to fight it again, at which time the government, in its
wisdom, decided not to do so and, in effect, sanctioned the
charges of the Americans.
Senator Murray: Not so far as your region is concerned,
however.
Senator McElman: But that decision affected the whole of
Canada. The maritime provinces had already boosted their
stumpage rates on their own initiative, but Quebec, Ontario,
the prairie provinces to a lesser degree and, to the greatest
degree, British Columbia were affected. This was a case in
which Americans exercised extraterritoriality at both the provincial and federal levels and were permitted to get away with
it. That, honourable senators, is frightening. They were, in
effect, able to dictate to the provinces through the federal
authorities what the stumpage rates would be.
In my part of the country stumpage rates, as the Leader of
the Government has suggested, had been raised on several
occasions as revenue producers. But over the years stumpage
rates have been used in the maritimes as economic stimulators
in order to keep the forest industry thriving. Here, then, we
have the United States reaching its hand into Canada not just

at the provincial but at the federal level. That is rather
disconcerting and is a cause for concern. It does leave one
wondering how far they will be permitted to go.
Without providing any great detail, one wonders about the
future of SYSCO, with which my honourable friend is most
familiar. He has spoken of no more quotas being administered
by the Americans, but, again, what about subsidies? What
constitutes a subsidy? There is some concern that during that
five- to seven-year period, while these decisions are being
made, existing U.S. law will prevail. The maritime provinces
could be hammered simply by the application of existing law
during the period in which no decision has been made on what
constitutes a subsidy.
The situation involving the Michelin tire corporation, of
course, is a fine example of what the Americans can do to a
Canadian industry through the ITC. Honourable senators will
remember that the "poor" tire manufacturers of the United
States claimed damage flowing from the practices of this
industry in Nova Scotia. Michelin eventually prevailed, but
only after something like seven or eight years before the courts
in the U.S. and the expenditure of several millions of dollars.
Many of our industries cannot afford those years before the
courts or the costs attendant upon such applications.
Consider for a moment our fishing industry. The instant we
began to upgrade product from fish blocks we were faced with
tariffs. That practice will disappear and that is good. But in
the past the attacks upon our exports have been made on the
basis of Canadian subsidies. And what was the most common
allegation against the Canadian industry? It involved unemployment insurance.
Senator Murray: And what was the result?
Senator McElman: The most recent result was a 17.5 per
cent duty placed on some of our upgraded fish products. The
Americans were successful in establishing a duty against our
products, and it involved our unemployment insurance provisions. This is what has been used time and time again, usually
unsuccessfully in the final result, but at great cost to the
industry in the maritime provinces.

One need not go into any detail about the food-processing
industry because it *has been dealt with by Senator MacEachen, and Mr. McLean of McCain Foods has before committees in both Houses of Parliament and throughout the
campaign dealt with it in great detail. I have no fear that
McCain Foods will be closing down their operations. These
people are entrepreneurs of great ability. They started a very
small operation in the mid-upper Saint John River valley.
From that they have become one of the great multinationals of
Canada. 1 believe they are now in Il countries apart from
Canada. Theirs is a great success story.
However, they have made it very evident that their expansion plans will not be for Canada. Their expansion plans will
be in the United States. That is a cause of concern.
In my own province the family that is the greatest in
industrial terms-the Irving family-is whole-heartedly in

SENATE DEBATES
SENATE DEBATES
support of tbe Free Trade Agreement. One can understand
why. They too are in food processing, and in fairness one must
say that they take the opposite view of McCain's.
1 believe there is a good basis for concern about some
aspects of the Free Trade Agreement. The dispute-settiement
panel and the powers, or lack of powers. of tbat pane! leave a
great dca! to be desired. Senator MacEachen explained the
process. After the event before the ITC that panel can decide
whetber existing law bas been applied fairly. Beyond that. they
have littie power.
Wben the whole question of free trade was initial!y discussed the Prime Minister, Mr. Mulroney, said that there were
to be two absolute requirements. These bad to be met before
his government would accept sucb an agreement. The first
requirernent was that the Arnericans wou!d give up countervai!. Anyone who understands anytbing about trade knows
that no nation-not Canada and not the United States-is
going to give up countervail. The second requirement was that
there would be a binding dispute-sett!ernent rnecbanism. That
was not achieved either, because its powers are not sucb as to
make their decisions ful!y binding upon the two nations.
During -the election carnpaign Mr. Sirnon Reisman, either
on bis own or at someone's bebest, decided to enter the debate.
In the course of it be was cbal!enged and admitted that he and
bis peop!e were unab!e to consider and negotiate the matter of
deve!opment
regional
developrnent assistance-regiona!
grants. That, to me, is some indication of the priority tbat the
administration put upon regiona! developrnent grants, wbich
are vital to tbe continued deve!opment of industry in the
Atlantic area, although we are not bappy to admit tbat.
Honourab!e senators, it has to be tbe hope and wisb of each
and every one of us tbat tbis Free Trade Agreement wi!! be
beneficia! to Canada, tbat it wi!l be successfu! and beneficia!
to both nations, because it can only be a good agreement if it is
beneficia! to both nations. As a maritime free trader, for rny
own cbi!dren and rny chi!dren's children, 1 desperate!y hope it
wi!l be successfu!. 1 say to you that in tbe maritime provinces
today there is a deep concern about wbat tbe effects of it wi!!
be. Tbose concernis were evident in the outcorne of tbe election.
Tbere are 32 seats in tbe At!antic area and 20 of thern went to
the Libera! opposition. !n the three provinces of the maritime
area the resu!t was 15 Libera! seats and 10 Conservative seats.
The e!ection in the maritimes was very definitely a free trade
issue e!ection.
1 would hope that that in itself wou!d irnpress upon the
governrnent that there are concerns. Most of tbem do hinge
upon tbe five- to seven-year period and the decision of what a
subsidy is. 1 would hope that the government in its wisdom can
take into account the resu!t of the election and find the means
to give assurance to the people of the Atlantic area that they
wi!l not be forgotten, as they were by Simon Reisman when he
did not have time to consider regiona! deve!opment grants in
bis negotiations witb the Arnerican negotiators.
1 wou!d hope that the administration wi!l not on!y provide

MacEachen outlined. We did say at tbat time, as 1 feel we

an e!ection and not to a referendum, that if tbe government
received a majority in the House of Commons and the Flouse
of Commons passed the legisîation we wouîd !et it pass rapid!y.
The question, then, is: "What is "rapid!y'?" 1 think we bave

the debate on second reading of this bill.
Somne Hon. Senators: Hear, hear!
Senator Murray: Honourable senators, there was a trne
when 1 could have worked on that syllogism, because 1 believe
1detected what we used to call an undistributed middleSenator Frith: Which leads to a fallacy.
Senator Murray: -which leads to a fallacy. But 1 arn a bit
rusty in that area and 1 wiIl not pursue the point, especially at
this late hour.
With regard to the intervention that we have just heard
from the Deputy Leader of the Opposition to the effect that he
and his colleagues would abstain on a vote on second reading
of this bill, if my friends opposite insist on a standing vote so
that they may have the opportunity to record their abstentions,
then, of course, we wiIl accommodate them. But it would suit
no part of my, or our, intention tonight to call for a standing
vote. The hour is late, the night is stormy, and 1, for one, have
40 miles to drive. Unless honourable senators absolutely insist
on a vote, we can let second reading go, on division-that is, if
tbey are willing to do so.
The narrative which we heard a few moments ago from
Senator McElman about barassment of Canadian-indeed,
maritime-industries by U.S. business and political interests
over the years and somte. of the specific cases that he cited
constitute one of the strongest arguments for this Free Trade
Agreement.
Recent history and not so recent history in our commercial
dealings wîth the United States constitute the strongest possible argument for securing and placing on a stable basis this
great trading relationship between Canada and the United
States. In particular, recent bistory points out the need for a
mechanism such as the dispute-settlement mechanism that is
contained in the Free Trade Agreement between Canada and
the United States.
The complaint that we have had in recent years has not been
about American law per se but, rather, about the polîticization
of the process, about harassment, as Senator McElman properly pointed out in one of the cases to which he referred. the
softwood lumber case. We knew that that process had become
SO higbly politicized and that the political pressures were so
great that our chances of getting a fair hearing were not very
great. We were destined to lose the case and we had to deal.
Precisely what we have gained under the dispute-settlement
mechanism are time-the honourable senator pointed out that
the actions by U.S. interests have consumed years and years of
time at great expense on the part of smaller Canadian producers-and an objective examination of the law and the application of the law in place of a highly political process. That is
what we mean when we say that we have made strides in
applying the rule of law to these cases.
The honourable senator complains that the panels can only
decide if domestic law has been applied fairly and objectively.
That in itself is a considerable gain. There are "panels" and

-panels". One of the duties of binational panels, for example,
will be to examine new laws that may be passed in the United
States. If those new trade remedy laws should specifically
target Canada-as they would have to do to apply to us-then
a binational mechanism will examine whether or not those new
laws are consistent both with the GATT and with the spirit of
the Free Trade Agreement.
I appreciate the honourable senator's concern about regional
development programs, especially in the Atlantic provinces. 1
continue to believe that the new regional development programs that this government bas introduced in the Atlantic
provinces and the Free Trade Agreement together constitute
the best chance that the Atlantic region bas bad in my lifetime
to make real economic progress vis-à-vis the rest of the
country.
An Hon. Senator: Hear, bear!
Senator McElman: And 1 hope you are right.
Senator Murray: 1 can tell the honourable senator-and he
knows this-that for 15 or 16 months 1was minister in charge
of ACQA. 1 bave taken some interest in these matters for a
long time. My own examination of the programs that we and
previous governments have put in place in the Atlantic provinces in the field of regional development does not lead me to
think that any of these programs are in any danger at aIl from
the Free Trade Agreement.
Honourable senators, wbile 1 do not question the sincerity of
the speeches and the concerns that have been expressed by
those senators who have expressed themr this afternoon, the
pervasive sentiment in the speeches that we have heard is fear
of the unknown; fear of the future; fear, in somne cases, of the
United States; and fear of taking a chance.
Senator Frith: Consequences of a bad deal.
Senator Murray: These speeches, honourable senators, together constitute an argument for the status quo, an argument
for doing nothing. But, honourable senators, the status quo is
not a viable option for Canada.
Senator Frith: The argument is to do better, not to do
nothing!
Senator Murray: The protectionist trends that we saw in the
United States, in the United States political system, in the
Congress are still there; they have not abated. If anything,
they have increased with the composition of the new Congress
elected in November last. When one views the world scene, one
quickly cornes to the conclusion that the status quo is not a
viable option for Canada.
You see trading blocs being consolidated around the
world-for example, the consolidation of the European Economic Community-and you know that without the Free
Trade Agreement Canada remains vîrtually the only western
industrialized nation without access to a market of 200 million
people or more. So the status quo is not an option, and fear of
the future, fear of the unknown and uncertainty wiIl not get us
very far.

SENATE DEBATES
SENATE DEBATES
We have had the most elaborate hypotheses constructed this
afternoon, on the basis of which future calamities have been
foretold. What if the GATT panel rules against the restrictions
that we have put in place on ice cream and yogurt? What will
happen to our ice cream? If the GATT panel rules against us
in that case, will the Europeans feel encouraged to challenge
us on cheese? If the GATT panel rules against us on cheese.
what will happen then? These are questions for the future and
surely, serious as they are, they do not constitute a valid reason
for opposing the Free Trade Agreement with the United
States. We have been told that Canadian businessmen will
complain about the costs they bear as a result of social
programs and the consequent effect on their competitiveness.
So what else is new? When did they not complain? They
always complain and they will go on complaining about that
subject. We have been told that United States businessmen
will say that Canadian social programs are subsidies and
therefore countervailable. Well, so what?
I should like to bring to the attention of the Leader of the
Opposition comments by someone whom I am sure he will
respect. Senator Daniel Moynihan, the senior U.S. Democratic
senator from New York, writing in the Financial Posi of
November 17 with regard to the question of whether the U.S.
might assert that such social welfare programs as Medicare or
pensions constitute subsidies to Canadian business and accordingly must be eliminated, said that the answer is "no, never,
not a chance, not a scintilla of possibility." Senator Moynihan
went on to point out that the U.S. social security retirement
benefits budget alone is some $232 billion and that you can
add to that income security spending of $136 billion, of
spending of $86 billion, and then the total social welfare cost
to the U.S. government soon exceeds the entire gross domestic
product of Canada, which will be about $325 billion U.S. in
1988. So Senator Moynihan says, I think with some logic, that
if he had had the faintest notion that under the proposed Free
Trade Agreement their social programs, for which he documents the costs, might be open to attack from Ottawa's
subsidies the agreement would never have left the finance
committee in the United States. He says, "Period. End of
subject."
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, it is now six
o'clock and, according to rule 12, I must leave the Chair.
However, you may wish to disregard the clock.
Senator Frith: Let us do that.
Senator Doody: Let us not see the clock.
Senator Murray: Honourable senators, I shall not trespass
for very long on the time of the house. Senator Moynihan went
on to say that the most important point as regards the status of
Canada's social welfare programs, the Free Trade Agreement,
changes nothing, that the General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade precludes any U.S. trade action directed against Canada's Medicare or social programs or any other general benefit
program. He said that this approach had been accepted since
GATT was founded 40 years ago; that the issue is simply not
an issue. Secondly, he points out that U.S. countervailing duty
law does not consider pension or health benefits a subsidy, that
[Senaitor Murray]

December 27. 1988
December 27. 1988

these programs are accepted as generally available under U.S.
law and not subject to countervailing duties. No such program
has ever been countervailed.
So. honourable senators, I think those quotations of Senator
Moynihan of the United States put the argument about social
programs in some perspective-the perspective of the GATT
and the perspective of U.S. trade law, which, as he points out,
does not consider such programs as being countervailable.
Honourable senators. I think I heard the Leader of the
Opposition say in reference to the five- to seven-year negotiations that are about to take place that social programs and
subsidies are still on the table. Social programs are not on the
table. Social programs have not been on the table and they will
not be on the table. Senator Buckwold went even further when
he said that we have seven years to harmonize our social
programs. There is absolutely no justification for such a
statement. It is absolute nonsence. It is simply not true. There
will be negotiations for five to seven years. The mandate of our
negotiating team will be settled by the government. The team
itself will be appointed. As I said, social programs will continue to be excluded.
When the Honourable Leader of the Opposition says that
we must look at the economic forces that the Free Trade
Agreement will unleash and at the pressures to change our
social programs, I only say to him, look at history. Look at the
lessons of other countries that have had far different social
programs from their trading partners yet have formed free
trade agreements. Sweden has free trade agreements with
most of western Europe; yet it has social programs that are
vastly more costly and extensive than her trading partners'.
She has not had to change those social programs because of
any pressures from her trading partners in the trading agreement. The same is true of Holland, also a member of the
European Economic Community, which has social programs
that are more costly and different. If the honourable senator
needs a final example, surely our own country provides it. The
present network of social programs was built up precisely at
the time when Canadian trade barriers with the United States
were being largely dismantled and trade barriers between
Canada and the rest of the world were falling.
The Honourable Leader of the Opposition has repeated the
concerns with regard to energy that he expressed on an earlier
occasion. He will have an opportunity to pursue these matters
in more detail at the committee stage, particularly the questions he has about the role of the National Energy Board
vis-à-vis the government. It is true that if the board should
decide that restrictions on exports to the United States are
appropriate then it will be up to the Cabinet to decide if the
government will impose controls. The Free Trade Agreement
is between the United States and the Canadian government. It
is not with the National Energy Board. If the honourable
senator sees some loss of authority for the National Energy
Board in that provision, then he is correct. It will be up to the
government to impose the controls in a manner consistent with
the Free Trade Agreement.

The honourable senator bas also made the point that
Canada is obliged to share its oil with the United States in a
shortage. At leasi, 1 think 1 beard him say as much. The fact
of the matter is that in the case of a shortage Canada is flot
obliged t0 share anything with the United States, except, of
course, under the presenit provisions of the International
Energy Agreement. Tbe fact of the matter is that the obligation would be to administer any controls that we introduced in

discreet charm.
Senator MacEachen referred to Senator Cottreau's maiden
speech in this Chamber more than 14 years ago. In it, Senator
Cottreau spoke of subjects that are still topical today. He said
that he would focus on three main principles during bis time in
the Senate. First, he warned that foreign fleets off Canadian
shores were a real danger to our fishermen's livelihood. Senator Cottreau then promised to work for more harmonious
relations between French- and English-speaking Canadians.
Finally, he promised to work to improve the situation of the
Acadians in Nova Scotia.
1 believe one can say without false modesty that Senator
Cottreau faithfully followed the course he set for himself. He
was able to defend those interests and rise above mere party
politics.

Minister and ail my colleagues, 1 thank you for a job welI

Although 1 realize this is not a written law, that tradition is
very much appreciated among Acadians.
In the future, I would hope tbat the Canadian government
wilI favourably consider maintaining that sound practice. As

Hon. Paul Lucier: Honourable senators, yesterday I asked

Yukon and Northwest Territories in any future discussions; I
know that he did not intentionally mislead me, but I am
wondering if there is a possibility that I did not get the answer
that I should have received.

it seriously.
Senator Doody: Ask it, then!

Senator Lucier: The minister responded by saying that my
question was based on a faulty hypothesis, which was that
there may be some future discussions on Meech Lake and the
changing of the Meech Lake Accord.
In answer to Senator Molgat and Senator Austin, following
my inquiry, the minister said that a letter had been received
from Premier Filmon, and that an article had appeared in the
Globe and Mail in which the Premier of Manitoba had said
that there was an impending crisis because of the Meech Lake
Accord, and he had written to the government and asked that
some meetings take place. All I was asking for yesterday was
the assurance that, if any meetings were to take place, the
elected representatives of the Yukon and the Northwest Territories would be invited. He seemed to think there was no
possibility that meetings would take place, and later on I think
he said that there were some requests for meetings.
My simple question now is the same as it was yesterday: If
any meetings are scheduled to discuss constitutional matters,
will the elected leaders of both the Yukon and the Northwest
Territories be invited to attend? That is not a difficult question, honourable senators; it requires a simple yes or no.
* (1420)

Hon. Lowell Murray (Leader of the Government, Minister
of State for Federal-Provincial Relations and Acting Minister
of Communications): Well, let me deal first with the question
of territorial representation at First Ministers' meetings. It has
been the practice under this government, as 1 believe it was
under our predecessor government, that at formai public meet-

ings of the First Ministers the elected heads of government of
both territories are invited to attend and, at a given point in
the proceedings, are invited to speak. We will continue to
respect that practice.
The meeting to which I referred yesterday is one that was
effectively announced by the Prime Minister in October; it is
an informal luncheon of First Ministers such as was held
following the 1984 election. I believe the Prime Minister said
that it will be held some time in the first quarter of the coming
year. It is an informai meeting of First Ministers. The territorial leaders are not normally invited to attend such meetings,
and will not be in this case.
I would also like to emphasize that, while I would be very
surprised if the matter of the status of the Meech Lake
ratification process did not come up, the meeting has not been
called for the purpose of discussing Meech Lake or, indeed,
constitutional matters in general. It is an informai meeting
that would be preparatory to a more formai, public meeting to
be held perhaps later on in 1989.
Senator Lucier: Honourable senators, the minister has just
expressed the very fear that we have in the Yukon. He has said
that he would be very surprised if the Meech Lake affair did
not come up during this private meeting of First Ministers.
What I am saying is that there should be no meetings of First
Ministers without the attendance of the elected representatives
of the Yukon and Northwest Territories. If the Meech Lake
Accord or any constitutional matter is to be discussed at that
meeting-and the minister has just said that he would not be
surprised if that were the case-then our elected representatives should be there. We are a big part of the Meech Lake
Accord since we are the ones affected seriously by it. Why
would we not be invited to attend meetings at which any
discussions of this subject take place?
Senator Murray: Weil, I have news for the honourable
senator. There is an amending formula in this country and it
involves the Parliament of Canada and the legislatures of the
ten provinces.
Senator Lucier: Well, I have news for the Leader of the
Government as well: The ignoring of the Yukon and Northwest Territories from here on in is a thing of the past. We had
better be invited to any meetings in which the Constitution is
discussed, whether it be with respect to Meech Lake or
anything else, or I would hope that my colleagues on both sides
of the Senate would have serious reservations in dealing with
the outcome of those meetings.
Senator Murray: Honourable senators, I do not know how
many times I have to repeat this. The luncheon that is being
held some time in the first quarter of 1989 is not for the
purpose of discussing the substance of the Meech Lake
Accord. I have offered what I think is the sensible, prudent
opinion that it would be surprising if, in the course of that
luncheon, the ratification process did not come up around the
table. That, it seems to me, as it involves only the ten provinces
and the Parliament of Canada, is not a matter to which it
would be necessary to have present representatives other than

SENATE DEBATESDeebr2.18
the representatives of those parties involved in the amending
formula.

Senator Lucier: Honourable senators, 1 was hoping that the
minister was improperly named when hie was called the minister responsible for federal-provincial relations. 1 was hoping
that somewbere down the line somebody would recognize that
there ought to be some reference in there to include the
territories. 1 arn disappointed to learn that the Leader of the
Government in the Senate feels that any meeting between the
leaders of the provinces and territories of Canada-leaders of
the people of Canada-sbould take place without the leaders
of the people of northern Canada. To be ignored by some
others would be bad enough, but to be ignored by the minister
is the greatest insuit that you could give us.
Senator Murray: Honourable senators, 1 do not wish to
thrasb old straw, but 1 sbould remind Senator Lucier that,
when the final deal on patriation was made in the 1981-82
exercise, in some kitchen in the Chateau Laurier, not only
were tbe territories absent but also one of the major partners
in Confederation was.

Senator Lucier: Honourable senators, that shows tbe type of
thinking that is donc by this government.
Senator Murray: 1did not hear you complaining.
Senator Lucier: The people of the Yukon were not invited to
the meetings; they could not have been at any of those
meetings. Tbe Premier of Quebec bad been invited, and could
have been there had be chosen to be.
Senator Lefebvre: Right on! Hypocrite!

December 28. 1988

First Ministers' meetings on the economy that took place
during our first mandate. 1 would expect that that same
informai and unstructured atmospbere will be as productive
this time as it was last.
Senator Stoliery: Honourable senators, productive it may
have been, but the result seems to be that the Premier of
Manitoba bas witbdrawn his approval of the Meecb Lake
agreement. 1 believe that tbe Minister of State for FederalProvincial Relations and Leader of the Government in the
Senate would agree witb me that under the circumstances the

entire country is watcbing the spectacle of tbe collapse of that
production that started several years ago. One of the premiers
bas withdrawn bis support, and there is the language issue that

bas arisen in Quebec. Does tbe minister not think that it would
be appropriate, and in the public interest, for an agenda to be
pubisbed so that tbe people of Canada can Find out what is

being decîded on their behaîf by a meeting of tbese Il
individuals?

Senator Murray: Honourable senators, as 1 bave indicated,
the informai meeting that is planned is mereîy preparatory to
other more formai meetings that will no doubt ensue, both at

the First Ministers' level and at the ministerial and officiais'
level. But 1 do not think that the people of Canada will object
to the fact that, after a general election and the re-election of a
government witb a majority mandate, First Ministers migbt
give themselves a few hours of quiet time to compare notes and
discuss tbe future. Tbat is wbat will happen.

bankrupt farmers-the sait of thîe earth in our part of the
worid-are waiting for these payments.
My question, aiter that lengthy preamble, is: Will the
payments go forward before January 15, or is it necessary ta
get the provincial governments' agreement to participate? And
what happens if the provinces do not agree ta share the cost?
Will the situation be clarified in the near future? It is a matter
of great importance to, us.
Hon. Loweil Murray (Leader of the Governmeuit, Minister
of State for Federal-Provincial Relations and Acting Minister
of Communications): Honourable senators, 1 hope the situation will be clarified in the near future. The short answer ta
the question asked by my honourable friend is that discussions
are still proceeding between ministers af the federal government and the provinces concerned.
My honourable frîend expressed same doubt as ta the
politics of the announcement made some weeks ago. 1 presurne
he bas no doubt that it is good public policy for the government ta corne ta the aid of farmers, wbo, as he said, are
suifering from what he bas described as a calamity.
He says that the provinces are astonished and that this was
not part of what he calîs the original plan. Without entering
into a debate on the matter, 1 point out that agriculture is a
matter of sbared jurisdiction between the federal and provincial governments, and 1 do not think the farmers would be
astonished ta hear that one expected the provinces alsa ta
corne ta their assistance in a situation such as the present one;
on the contrary.
Senator Buckwold: Honourable senators, in response ta the
minister's reply, in an article in the Financial Post: this
morning Bruce Stewart, an Ontario Agriculture and Food
Mînistry spokesman, said, "It is a federal program." That is
just the opposite ai what we have heard fram the Leader af the
Government in the Senate, wha, once again, is trying ta
soît-pedal an issue which is, in fact, the responsibility af the
Gavernment af Canada. It was their program as quotedSenator Barootes: Sa was MedicareSenator Buckwold: Would my hanourable friend repeat that
remark?
Senator Barootes: 1 say that Medicare was also a federallysponsored program, but it is cost-shared with the provinces.
Senator Buckwold: There is no doubt about it; there are
some cost-sharing prograrns; however, this was a program
announced by the federal governrnent. 1 assure the hanaurable
senator that I arn not rnaking this up by myseli; 1 arn merely
quoting a spokesman for the Gavernment of Ontario. If you
wish me ta name other spakesmen, 1 can do that toa.
However. 1 say ta the honourable senatar: Don't go out and
bribe the farmers of Saskatchewan-wbich is what your party
did; you went out and bribed thern for votes. Now you want
the provinces ta pay hall the cost. I want ta make sure that aur
farmers get the maney, and the deadline is naw only twa and a
hall weeks away.

POSITION

Hon. L. Norbert Thériauit: Honourabie senatars. my question is for the Leader ai the Gavernment in the Senate and 1
ask it an behaif ai many francophones outside Quebec. The
two Houses of Parliament are expected ta adjaurn for twa or
three months. This causes concern for francophones outside
Quebec. After the Government ai Quebec passed special legislation last week, we heard that there was a deal.
1 would like ta ask the Minister for Federal-Provincial
Relations if he is aware ai this "deai'" that was supposedly
reached between the Premiers ai Saskatchewan and Alberta
after their provinces passed legisiatian following the decision
rendered by the Suprerne Court ai Canada. This legislation
had the effect ai taking rights away fram the French-speaking
people in their provinces.
We did not hear a word from the sa-calied protectors ai the

francophone community in Canada or in Quebec. The Province ai Quebec passed a bill that takes rights away fram
anglophones but strangely enough, not a ward of protest was
heard from the Premiers ai Saskatchewan and Alberta.
Because of these events, the French-speaking minorities
throughout the country are wondering who is responsible for
minarity rights in Canada in 1988.
Hon. Loweii Murray (Leader of the Government, Minister
of State for Federal-Provincial Relations and Acting Minister
of Communications): First ai ail, honourable senatars, let me
say that 1 have no intention ai giving credence ta the faise
rurnaurs that Senator Thériault wishes ta spread about some
"deal" between certain provinces.
Secondly, 1 would tell him very simply that in aur jurisdiction the government and the federal Parliament passed Bill
C-72 before the electian. This law ensures that federal government services are availabie in English and French throughaut
the country.
As for provincial jurisdiction, aur poiicy is ta support linguistic minarities throughout the country by means ai agreements negotiated with the provincial gavernments.
The honourable senatar certainly knaws the policy ai the
federal government in this regard.
Senator Thériauit:- Honaurable senators, I arn giad ta hear
what the Minister ai State for Federal- Provincial Relations
bas just toid us. Nevertheiess, one must wonder where we have
corne ta in 1988 when an important minister ai the government ai Canada who is responsible for many prograrns that
apply ta minorîties throughout the country can say, on one
hand, that Quebec had ta do what it did, while, an the other
hand. the Prime Minister said that he was not pleased with it
and that he wauld have preferred something else.
Sa are yau surprised that francophones autside Quebec and
minarities throughout Canada, not aniy francophones outside

FOR COPY OF GOVERNMENT'S REPLY

Hou. Gildas L. Molgat: Honourable senators, my question is
to tbe Leader of tbe Government as the Minister of State for
Federal- Provincial Relations. Yesterday, wben 1 asked bim
wbetber the federal government bad responded to tbe letter
written by Premier Filmon of Manitoba and, if so, wbether 1
could bave a copy of tbat response, tbe minister agreed tbat be
would get a copy of tbe written reply, if one bad been made.
Has be been able to obtain a copy of tbat reply?
Hon. LoweIl Murray (Leader of the Goveroment, Minister
of State for Federal-Provincial Relations and Acting Minister
of Communications): Honourable senators, what 1 said yesterday was tbat Premier Filmon's attention bad been drawn to
tbe letter wbich tbe Prime Minister bad sent to the premiers in
October advising tbem that be would be calling an informai
meeting of First Ministers early in bis second mandate. 1 was
flot aware tbat a separate response to Premier Filmon's rnost
recent letter bad been sent. 1 arn under tbe impression tbat
sucb a letter bas not been sent, but my commitment stands,
and if 1 am wrong and a letter bas gone out 1 shall obtain a
copy of it and let tbe honourable senator bave it.
Senator Molgat: Honourable senators, 1 arn deeply disturbed if tbere bas been no response to Premier Filmon's
letter, because 1 bave bere a copy of bis letter of December 19
addressed to tbe Rigbt Honourable Brian Mulroney, Prime
Minister of Canada.
Senator Lefebvre: Read it!
Senator Molgat: It reads:
My dear Prime Minister:
1 arn writing to advise you of my Government's grave
reservations following the response of tbe Government of
Quebec to last week's Supreme Court decision concerning
rninority language rigbts in Quebec.
Unfortunately, tbat decision bas placed us on tbe verge
of a constitutional crisis and will seriously affect consideration in our province on tbe 1987 Constitutional Accord.
In so doing, it runs directly counter to our efforts and
yours to strengtben national unity.
Under these circumstances, rny caucus and 1 consider it
inadvisable to proceed witb the Meecb Lake Accord. As
you know, 1 introduced the resolution in our Legisiature
on Friday and debate is now underway, witb public
bearings scbeduled to begin next mnontb. The Quebec
Government's decision makes it clear tbat proceeding
IScnator Thériauli.I

with these bearings on tbe current schedule could cause
deep dissension throughout our province. For this reason.
1 will approach the leaders of the other parties in our
Legislature to pursue with them the withdrawal of the
resolution.
Given the vital importance of these constitutional issues
to the future of our country, 1 ask that you convene a
meeting of First Ministers on an urgent basis. 1 arn
prepared to corne to Ottawa as early as this week if such a
meeting can be arranged.
Clearly, this is a time for strong federal leadersbip and
Manitobans will look to you and your colleagues to play
an active role in ensuring that a solution to this impasse
can be found wbich is just to botb English and French
speaking Canadians and wbicb builds bridges between the
various provinces and regions in this country.
This letter bas been copied to Premier Bourassa and the
other Provincial Premiers.
1 look forward to your immediate response.
Sincerely yours,
Gary Filmon
With that kind of very specific request from the premier of a
province, wbo, at this particular stage, bas, as tbe minister tells
us, an important role in the matter of the constitutional
accord, is the minister telling me that the Prime Minister of
Canada bas not replied to that kind of letter?
Senator Murray: Honourable senators, the position of the
premier and the Government of Manitoba were made public
even before we received tbe letter. We replied publicly at once
on the basis of a number of aspects of the letter. First, we do
not agree witb the analysis that there is a constitutional crisis
in Confederation by reason of the events to, wbicb the premier
refers. Second, we pointed out to bim at the officiaIs and
ministerial levels, as we frequently do wben there are communications of tbis kind, that the Prime Minister bad already
notified premiers of bis intention to bave tbem to an informai
meeting early in bis second mandate. Third, we do not tbink it
is appropriate at this time to summon a full-fiedged First
Ministers' constitutional conference of tbe kind suggested by
tbe premier on tbe basis of tbe events of wbicb be speaks. The
premier bad bis response witbin a couple of hours of baving
made bis request.
Senator Molgat: Honourable senators, exactly bow did the
Premier of Manitoba get bis response? The minister tells us
tbat tbere bas been no letter. Tbe minister tells us tbat the
Prime Minister bas not wrîtten and tbat bie, the minister, bas
not written. Yesterday Senator Guay asked wbetber tbe minister bad pboned tbe premier, but be neyer answered tbat
question.
Senator Guay: Tbat's rigbt!
Senator Molgat: Tbe minister waffled around and said tbat

Filmon bas tried ta reach tbe Prime Minister Five times and
stili has flot received an answer from the Prime Minister.
Senator Guay: That's rigbt!
Senator Molgat: Could the minister tell me wbo on eartb
communicated witb the premier, and how and what they told
him?
Senator Murray: Honourable senators, perhaps I should
explain that bath the telephone conversation witb me and the
letter the bonaurable senatar has just read into the record were
overtaken by events. The premier called me-I believe it was
three minutes before he made his public announcement-to
make it very clear ta meSenator McElman: A Liberal would neyer do that.
Senator Flynn: Carstairs might.
Senator Murray: -that he was not calling ta seek my
advice, and certainly nat ta discuss the matter with me. He
made il very clear that he was sîmply informing me that in
three minutes he would be making public the position that he
has outlined in that letter. The premier made that position
public. The7 letter was sent, but before it even arrived here he
had beld bis press conference and made bis statement. He bad
made bis request, and we, tbrougb a news conférence that I
beld on behalf ai the gavernment, replied ta bis position. Sa
there is no uncertainty about the premier's position as outlined
in the letter, and there is no uncertainty about aur position.
Senator Molgat: Honourable senators, the minister is going
around in circles and be is flot answering the question. Let me
make a statement and, if 1 am wrang, he can stand up and
correct me.
*(1450)

Senator Molgat: My four statements. tben, are correct. That
is the response ai the federal gavernment. That is tbe new
metbod ai federal-provincial understanding, the new spirit.
Hon. Joseph-Philippe Guay: Furtber to tbe questions asked
by Senator Malgat, I should like ta ask the Leader af tbe
Government if, whjle be was in conversation witb tbe Premier
of ManitobaSenator Murray: Your name did flot came up once.
Senator Guay: I have no daubt about that. because I do flot
belong ta bis caucus, atberwise it might bave.
I was gaing ta ask the Leader ai the Gavernment wbether
the Premier ai Manitoba let it be knawn ta bim that bie had
made a few attempts ta speak ta the Prime Minister by
telephane and that he could nat get througb or did not have bis
caîls returned.
Senator Murray: Hanourable senatars, I think my friend is
sligbtîy confused about the cbronology bere. On the day the
premier reacbed me be bad tried, a few minutes befare, ta
reach the Prime Minister. As I told the Senate yesterday, the
Prime Minister was an bis way ta Question Period in the
House ai Commans and could not take tbe call at that precise
time.
Senator Guay: Tbe reason 1 put the question ta the Leader
ai the Government is that it is my understanding from newspaper articles published in my area that the premier did nat caîl
him only once; apparently, he called several times and the calls
went unanswered.
Senator Murray: 1 do nat tbink tbe premier has made that
assertion. My understanding fram wbat I have seen in the
media is that the premier bas said that he bad been trying ta
reacb the Prime Minister in mare recent days and could not do
sa. That shauld nat be surprising, given the wark schedule the
Prime Minister bas been facirig these past few weeks. As I
indicated in the bouse yesterday, wben a premier wants ta
reacb tbe Prime Minister, be reaches bim as soan as that can
be arranged.
Senator Guay: The Prime Minister may be able ta reach a
premier, but it is only a ane-way deal.

First, referring ta the letter whicb was received, yau bave
not written ta the Premier ai Manitoba; second, the Prime
Minister ai Canada, ta wbam the letter was addressed, bas nat
written ta the Premier ai Manitoba-, third, yau bave not spoken
ta the Premier ai Manitoba since he made tbat formai request;
and fourth, tbe Prime Minister ai Canada bas flot spoken ta
the Premier ai Manitoba since that requesi. I assume that is
the response fram the federal gavernment.

THE CONSTITUTION
FIRST MIN ISTERS* MEETINGS-PARTICIPATION BY TERRITORIES

Hon. Paul Lucier: Honourable senators, my question for the
Leader of the Government in the Senate concerns the participation of members of both northern territories in any further
constitutional discussions which may take place. I arn sure you
will accept the fact that it is fairly difficuit to fight a war until
you establish who is the exact enemy.
1 should like to know-and 1 think the people of the two
northern territories are entitled to know-whether the federal
government has objected to having the two elected leaders
present at any constitutional conferences or at any constitutional discussions which take place with First Mînisters.
Would it be the federal government which would object, the
premiers who would object, or would it be both?
Hon. Loweil Murray (Leader of the Government, Minister
of State for Federal-Provincial Relations and Acting Minister

of Communications): Honourable senators, 1 believe there
were four or ive annual First Ministers' Conferences on the
economy during the first mandate of this goverfiment. There
have been several constitutional conferences on aboriginal
constitutional rights. These are formai, First Ministers'
Con ferences.
1 believe 1 amn correct in stating that at each of them,
following the practîce which, 1 believe, was established by our
predecessors, the heads of goverfiment of the territories have
[Sciiator Leblanc.]

December 28.1988
December 28. 1988

been present and have been invited to speak. That is the
established practice in the federation at the moment.
1 ar nfot sure whether the honourable senator is suggesting
some change in that practice or whether he is suggesting that
we have somehow departed from the practice. because we have
not.
Senator Lucier: Honourable senators. in the first instance. 1
arn trying to establish the exact problem. 1 do not think these
meetings are quite as formai as the minister makes them out to
be. 1 should like to say at this time that there bas been
increasing participation by the two northern territories in these
conferences. 1 think the last government did a reasonable job,
in most cases, of having the representatives of the Yukon and
Northwest Territories participate. 1 ar nfot suggesting for one
second that that bas flot taken place or that we do flot
appreciate the little tidbits that we have received. What 1 arn
saying is that we have gone beyond that. We have rcached the
point now where serious constitutional changes affecting the
two territories have taken place and will continue to take
place, and they are flot allowed to participate.
1 would preface my remarks by saying that 1 arn asking for
changes. 1 think what bas taken place up to this point is flot
good enough. We have grown up; we have gone beyond the
point of just being able to attend a conference and, either
before or after the conference, make a 15-minute speech. We
have gone beyond that. We want to be partners in the decisionmaking. 1 arn asking the minister whether he disagrees with
that. If he does, that's fine; that is ail we want to know. If he
does flot disagree with that, then who ducs? Is it the premiers?
Somebody does flot agree that we should be there as full
partners in discussions of the Constitution.
e(1500)
1 ar n ot saying that we want to be full partners in every

First Ministers' Conference. I arn just saying that. when the
subject matter of such a conference affects us, we want to be

there to take a full part in the discussions.
Senator Murray: The honourable senator says that the
Yukon and Northwest Territories want to be part of the
decision-making process. It is flot a question of the federal
government's or the provincial goverfiments' objection to that.
The fact is that there is an arnending formula in this country,
as 1 said earlier. The participants in the process of amending
the Constitution are the federal Parliament and the provinces.
While the honourable senator can properly request and
expect that the views of the territorial goverfiments should be
sought, heard and respected, we cannot go beyond that. They
are flot part of the formai decision-making process with regard
to constitutional amendments, and will flot be until they
achieve provincial status.
Senator Lucier: Honourable senators, I think I have
received my answer. We will flot be part of the process until
we become provinces. Since, through Meech Lake, every province bas a veto against our becoming provinces, we are just flot
going to be able to participate. I think that is the answer I was
iooking for.

DELAYED ANSWER TO ORAL QUESTION
SOCIAL INSURANCE
ABUSE 0F SIN--GOVERN MENT ACTION

Hon. C. William Doody (Deputy Leader of the Goverament): Hanourable senators, I bave one delayed answer te a
question asked by Senator Oison on December 20 regarding
the use of social insurance numbers.
Hon. Charles McElman: Is it lengtby?
Senator Doody: No, il is not lengtby in terms of tbe
discussions in tbis place.
Senator McElnîan: Would you mind reading it, then?
Senator Doody: No, flot at ail. As I said, the question was
raised on December 20 regarding the abuse of "SIN", wbicb
probably means "social insurance number".
Senator McElman: It is faîrly difficuit to abuse sin.
Senator Doody: Yes; that seems to be somnewbat contradictory, but 1 pass it on anyway.
Tbe press release referred to by Senator Oison Iast week
deait in fact witb the non-statutary use of social insurance
numbers, and not witb tbe statutory use as applied tbrough the
Income Tax Act. lndeed, tbe administration of tbe Income
Tax Act is specifîcally exempted from tbis policy. There is
therefore no inconsistency witb Bill C-i139. The measures
contained in C-I139 witb respect to the reporting of investment
and interest income were first outlined in the June 18, 1987
White Paper an Tax Reform tabled by the Honourable Micbacl Wilson. The ways and means motion was subsequently
tabled on December 16, 1987.
i am cognizant of tbe argument, wbicb bas raged for some
lime now, over the use of social insurance numbers for any
purpose otber than tbeir original intention. Honourable senators should know, however, tbat this particular measure in Bill
C- 139 is absolutely necessary in terms of confirming taxpaycrs' reported income and preventing abuse. It represents a
signif icant cost saving ta the goverfiment.
I must stress aiso that the Incarne Tax Act sets out strict
conridentiality requirements and provides for penalties in the
event tbat tbe requirements are breacbed.
Senator McElman: In cannection with tbat, I regret that I
was nat in the chamber a week ago yesterday wben there was a
tidbit of information put on tbe record of tbc Senate that was
inaccurate. One of the honourable senators an this side of the
house said that, in the province of New Brunswick, in order ta
abtain a salmon fisbing licence anc must provide one's social
insurance number. I should simply like ta correct that piece of
information for the benefit of the Senate and of those wbo love
ta ish in my beautiful province.
That was the case; that was the requirement of tbe provincial governiment. Having gone ta two outiets where sncb
licences were issued, having been told that I had ta pravide my
social insurance number, and having refused ta do sa, I
contacted the then minister, wbo was helpful and cooperative

in this regard. He issued instructions te bis department that
this practice would cease forthwith.
Hon. Eymard G. Corbin: Honourable senators. 1 besitated
to risc following Senator Doody's delayed answer to that
question, but since Senator McElman bas interjected bis comment 1see my way free to do likewise.
1 raîsed tbe question of tbe social insurance numbers being
used by insurance campanies. writing to insured Canadians
requiring "under the law and regulations" tbeir social insurance numbers. It seems to me tbat a citizen. inasmucb as be
sbould not be ignorant of tbe law, could be given tbe courtesy
of the citation of tbe law or regulation under wbich the
insurance companies can "request" tbe social insurance numbers of tbose wbom tbey insure. If tbat is tbe law and the
request is made under a regulation emanating from tbe law,
then ordinary citizens, even tbougb they sbould not be ignorant of tbe law, migbt be informed of it.
Tbis seems to me to be a basic courtesy tbat sbould be
extended to ordinary Canadian citizens so that tbey can
understand bow tbe law of the country operates and the
reasons for wbicb the government demands of insurance cornpanies tbat their clients supply their social insurance numbers.
Tbis is a new tbing in Canadian life. If everybody invoived in
that process is to receive tbe cooperation of people down tbe
line, tbey should be properly informed.
If an insurance campany, or any otber company affected
under tbis act, is gaing ta take the trouble to write a form
letter, slip it inta an envelope, pay 37 cents for a stamp. and
demand that tbe client complete tbe reply and slip it into
anotber envelope at tbe cost of another 37-cent stamp, surely it
would not be mucb more difficuit ta insert anather paragrapb
in the letter te state tbe law and regulatian under wbicb tbis is
being donc.
Many people are mystified by tbis action. In tbe past tbey
bave neyer been asked te supply tbis sort of information.
Furtbermore, most people, knowing that the social insurance
number is a confidential matter between tbe government and
tbemselves, are flot readily dîsposed ta pass their social insurance numbers on to an insurance company, a bank or any
other institution.
I hope tbat message is undersbood somewhere, somehow.
Senator Doody: I appreciate tbe comments made by tbe
bonourable senator. I shahl see that tbey are brougbt to tbe
attention of the appropriate department. If I receive more
information in this regard, I shaîl bring it forward.

DEBATE

Hon. Nathan Nurgitz rose, pursuant ta notice of Tuesday,
December 20, 1988:
That he will call the attention of the Senate ta the
Eightieth Inter-Parliamnentary Conierence, held at Sofia,
Bulgaria, from l9th ta 24th September. 1988.
He said: Honourable senators, 1 arn pleased ta prescrnt the
report af the Eightieth Inter-Parliamentary Conference held at
Sofia, Bulgaria, from September 19 ta 24, 1988. 1 seek the
agreement af the Senate ta table the report of the conference. 1
will flot bc seeking your approval ta append the report ta
today's proceedings, because the report will be circulated ta ail
members of the IPU and will be available ta ail] honourable
senators.
The Hon. the Speaker: Is it agreed, honourable senatars?
Hon. Senators: Agreed.
Report tabled.
Senator Nurgitz: As we are aIl aware, the central aim of the
Inter-Parliamentary Union is ta advance the cause of peace
and international cooperation by supporting the objectives ai
the United Nations. At the prescrnt time 110 countries are
members. Next year, 1989, marks the centenary ai the union,
and special celebrations are planned at the twa regular conferences held by the IPU.
In advance ai each conierence there is a meeting ai the
western and Iike-minded cauntries, known as the 'TwelvePlus", ta discuss the conference agenda and ta develop
cammon positions where possible. When the regular conference is held in an East Bloc country, it is custamary for the
Twelve-Plus ta meet at a separate location. Senator Neiman
and I attended this meeting in Oslo, the capital city ai the
Norwegian chairman ai the Twelve-Plus.
Amang the tapics we discussed was the proposaI for an IPU
meeting ai the signatory groups ai the Conierence an Eurapean Ca-operatian and Security, which was scheduled ta be
held in Bucharest in May 1989. The West German graup
raised the issue ai the situatian in Romania, where certain
minarities are being subjected ta civil rights abuses and where
authorîties plan ta destray entire rural communities thraugh
iorced removals.
Aiter discussing whether ta issue a statement criticizing the
seriaus human rights violations or ta take ather action, the
Twelve-Plus group decided it would simply seek a postpone-

ment, witbout giving a statement, in order to demonstrate
concern about the situation in Romania while at the same time
avoiding a major confrontation tbat could barm tbe CECS
process.
Prior to its departure the Canadian delegation received
interesting'and informative briefings from officiais in our
Department of External Affairs. At our first delegation meeting in Sofia the Canadian Ambassador to Yugosiavia, wbo is
accredited to Bulgaria, Mr. Terence C. Bacon, briefed the
delegation on Bulgarian-Canadian relations, especiaiiy dealing
witb the position of tbe Bulgarian goverfiment witb respect to
Canada's candidature for tbe United Nations Security Council, wbicb bas since been obtained.
Mr. Denis Laliberte, Second Secretary of our embassy in
Belgrade, assisted tbe delegation in Sofia. 1 sbouid like to
make a comment on tbe excellent work done by Mr. Laliberte,
as seen by ail delegates. 1 cannot say enough about the extra
effort tbat he put into the service to parliamentarians. Tbis
was especially important witb bis background knowledge of
tbe East Bloc countries. 1 sbould like to say a special word of
tbanks as weil to tbe two Canadian staffers, Mr. Stephen
Knowles, our own Canadian group executive secretary, and
Barbara Reynolds from tbe Parliamentary Centre, wbose
efforts botb before and during tbe conference were of valuable
assistance.
Tbe two subjects wbicb bad been selected for tbis conference were "International cooperation in tbe bumanitarian field
in bringing national legisiation into line witb international
rigbts, norms, principles and instruments" and "Implementation of tbe United Nations resolutions on the granting of
independence to colonial territories and to tbe elimination of
colonialism, racism and apartheid". Our colleague Senator
Bosa was one of tbe first speakers on the subject of international buman rigbts. He used tbis opportunity to speak to our
Bulgarian bosts about tbe need to respect tbe buman rigbts of
minority groups in tbeîr country, witb particular reference to
tbe Turkisb minority in Bulgaria. I understand that Senator
Bosa will be participating in tbis debate, and we look forward
to bearing more about bis intervention on that item.
Tbe 1IPU ruies provide that on tbe first day of tbe conference
a supplementary item is added to tbe agenda. Tbe Canadian
group, concerned that the trade in conventional weapons is
contributing to tbe escalation of conflicts, proposed a debate
on the subject of "Tbe urgency for ail states to adopt and
implement a policy of strict control of tbe export of military
goods and tecbnology to countries involved in or under imminent tbreat of bostilities." Our reasoning was that since tbe
end of the Second Worid War tbere have been in excess of 100
major conflicts, none of wbicb bave involved nuclear arms.
Tbat is flot to take away from the necessity of deaiing witb
that grave world danger, but these conflicts bave ail been with
conventional arms. Many millions of people bave lost tbeir
lives because of tbe use of conventional arms. That was wby
we sougbt tbat as an item.
In order for a subject to be cbosen it must receive at least
two-thirds of the votes cast. In cases wbere more tban one

subject receive the required majority. then the one with the
bigbest number of votes is the supplementary item. Our proposai did flot receive a majority. 0f the competing bids for a
supplementary item the Italian item dealing with the drug
trade was aiso defeated. The supplementary item that was
ultimately selected was "The popular uprising in the Arab
territories occupied by lsrael".
One of the signirîcant events that took place at this conference was an amendment to the IPLJ statutes proposed by our
own Canadian group. For severai years the union bas been
discussing ways to promote equality between men and women
in its organization and, in particular, to encourage greater
participation by women in the decision-making bodies of the
union. Voluntary action in tbis matter, as in many otbers. has
not succeeded in achieving this goal. It took 98 years of IPU
existence to finally get its first woman on the executive. The
Canadian group discussed various measures that could be
taken, and concluded that at ieast one of the positions on the
international executive committee sbould be designated for a
womnan parliamentarian. At a previous IPU conference held in
Guatemala City in April we submitted a formai proposai to
this effect, but the women parliamentarians recommended that
at ieast two positions shouid be designated for women. We
witbdrew our proposed amcndment and resubmitted it, as
amended by the meeting of women parliamentarians, for
consideration at tbis conference in Sofia.
1 arn extremcely pleased to report that the Canadian amendment was adopted unanimousiy; but it was flot an easiiy won
battie. At tbe meeting of the International Executive Committee immediately before the conference only two of the current
twelve members were in favour of it. Faccd witb this ratber
pessimistic outlook, 1 sbouid like to tbink that the Canadian
presentation to the meeting of women parliamentarians.
urging themr to lobby intensively the memnbers of their own
delegations and to meet with leaders of delegations wbicb did
neot include women, was very effective. This strong and fervent
effort paid off, for our amendment was adopted unanimously
both by tbe lnter-Pariamentary Council and, subsequently, by
the conference. 1 can bonestiy state that no one was more
surprised at this outcome tban tbe Canadian delegation, as we
faced considerabie opposition to our proposai and a reaction
that the timing was not right, as weil as the traditional reasons
given in rejecting women. We were prepared to resubmit a
modified proposai for subsequent conferences, but that, of
course, wiii flot be nccessary.
Another significant event for tbe Canadian delegation was
the election of our own coileague Senator Joan Neiman as a
permanent member of the Speciai Committee on tbe Violations of the Human Rigbts of Parliamentarians. At the IPU
Conference in Mexico City in 1976 Senator Neiman was a
member of the Canadian delegation which introduced the
proposai for the creation of this committee. She bas worked
extremeiy bard in promoting tbe work of tbis committee and
bas served as a substitute member for the past ten years. We
are extremely proud tbat sbe bas been eiected to tbis position
and extend our congratulations to bier. Since its inception in

SENATE DEBATES

SENATE DEBATES
1977 this committee has dealt with in excess of 600 cases and
has been successful in a large number of them. I understand
that Senator Neiman will likely be participating in this debate
perhaps tomorrow and can tell honourable senators more

about the important work of that committee.
e (1520)

The purpose of the IPU is to promote personal contacts
between all members of Parliament, to unite them in common

action to establish and develop representative institutions and
to advance the work of international peace and development.
Honourable senators, I think our report will demonstrate
how this purpose is being met.
Hon. Peter Bosa: Honourable senators, it is a pleasure to
participate in this debate on the Inter-Parliamentary Union
conference held in Bulgaria's capital city, Sofia, last
September.
Before mentioning the content of my remarks to the plenary
session in Sofia I want to pay tribute to our Bulgarian hosts for
their excellent hospitality. Everything was well organized. Our
conference was held in a magnificent convention centre known
as the Palace of Culture. It was very spacious, and we welcomed the use of such wonderful facilities.
Bulgaria's name derives from a Turkish people known as the
Bulgars, who originated in the Steppes north of the Caspian
Sea. One branch of the Bulgars settled near the mouth of the
Danube and founded the Bulgarian state in 681. They fell
under Turkish rule in 1396, and continued to be ruled by
Turkey for five centuries. Following the Russo-Turkish War of
1878 the principality of Bulgaria and the autonomous province
of Eastern Rumelia were constituted, both under Turkish
suzerainty. In 1885 Rumelia was reunited with Bulgaria,
creating a Bulgarian state with approximately the same
boundaries as present day Bulgaria.
A fully independent Bulgarian kingdom was proclaimed in
1908. Bulgaria allied with Germany in World War I and was
defeated. It allied with Germany again in World War Il and
declared war on the United States and the United Kingdom,
but not on the Soviet Union. In August 1944 Bulgaria opened
talks with allied representatives to take Bulgaria out of the
war. While those talks were under way the Soviet Union
declared war on Bulgaria. Soviet forces invaded the country
without resistance, and Communist rule began on September
9, 1944, when the fatherland front, aided by the U.S.S.R.,
seized power from the coalition government. The monarchy
was abolished in 1946 by popular referendum and the republic
was proclaimed. Elections followed, which confirmed Georgi
Dimitrov as both Prime Minister and First Secretary of the
Communist Party. All opposition parties were abolished and a
new Constitution, based on the Soviet model, was adopted in
1947.
For obvious political and geographic reasons, relations between Canada and Bulgaria are limited. Our two nations
established diplomatic relations in 1966, and Bulgaria named
its first ambassador to Canada in 1968. Canada does not have
[Senalor Nurgitz.]

December 28,1988
December 28. 1988

an embassy in Sofia, but the Ambassador to Yugoslavia is also
accredited to Bulgaria.
The level of trade between Canada and Bulgaria is very low.
From 1979 to 1984 Canadian exports fluctuated between a low
of $5.1 million in 1980 to a peak of SI 1.8 million in 1981.
Bulgarian exports to Canada consist mainly of apparel and
food and beverages. Canadian exports to Bulgaria have been
chiefly in the form of agricultural goods and raw materials.
Zinc and asbestos have been traditional exports, but at highly
fluctuating levels. Canadian firms have been successful in
exporting live cattle since 1982, and exports of rayon yarn
began in 1984. Efforts have been made to increase Canadian
exports of manufactured goods, with some success in geophysical equipment, instrument landing systems and agricultural
equipment.
As our honourable colleague Senator Nurgitz has already
mentioned, one of the purposes of the union is to support the
objectives of the United Nations. This year, 1988, marks the
fortieth anniversary of the signing of the Universal Declaration
of Human Rights, and it is fitting that the union should select
as one of the topics for this conference a debate on the subject
of the need for all states to pass legislation so that domestic
laws are in conformity with international human rights
instruments.
The proclamation of the Universal Declaration of Human
Rights in 1948 was a turning point in the history of civilization. This declaration outlines general standards and promotes
universal respect for, and observance of, human rights and
fundamental freedoms. In 1966 the United Nations General
Assembly adopted two international covenants--one on civil
and political rights and the other on economic, social and
cultural rights-which are treaties to give legal effect to the
1948 declaration. Two separate covenants were necessary
because the obligations enshrined in them are implemented
differently. For example, the covenant on civil and political
rights enumerates obligations that are immediate, such as
prohibiting torture, whereas the covenant on economic, social
and political rights outlines "progressive" obligations, such as
enacting measures that will lead to full employment. In the
case of the covenant on civil and political rights there is an
optional protocol under which individuals may report violations by their governments to the United Nations Human
Rights Commission, but as yet only 39 countries, including
Canada, have ratified this "individual reporting mechanism".
These four international instruments-the universal declaration, the two covenants and the optional protocol-make up
what is known as the International Bill of Rights. They form
the basis for our articulating our standards of acceptable
conduct in the field of human rights. While they are a solid
foundation for the promotion of human rights, they are by
their very nature general, broad guidelines. Over the past 20
years attention has been directed to developing a number of
specific instruments to deal with particular human rights in a
comprehensive manner, particularly with respect to definitions
and enforcements of monitoring mechanisms. For example, the
previous covenants dealt with torture in one or two clauses, but

December 28, 1988

the recent convention on torture spelled out in detail the
necessary changes in domestic legislation as well as the impiementation mechanisms needed to eradicate this barbarie practice. Honourable senators will recall that in 1987 we arnended
the Crirninal Code in order to comply with this convention.

INTER-PARLIAMENTARY UNION
EIGHTIETH CONFERENCE. SOFIA. BULGARIA

On the Order:
Resuming the debate on the inquiry of the Honourable
Senator Nurgitz calling the attention of the Senate to the
Eightieth Inter-Parliamentary Conference, held at Sofia,
Bulgaria, from I9th to 24th September, I 988.-(Honourable Senalor Neiman).
Hon. Joan Neiman: Honourable senators, the Inter-Parliamentary Union has a long history of concern for human rights,
a subject that is dealt with regularly by its Committee on
Parliamentary, Juridical and Human Rights. Honourable
senators will recaîl from vesterday's interventions by our colleagues Senators Nurgitz and Bosa that human rights was
again a major topic at the Sofia conference last September.
As those of you who have been delegates to IPU meetings
know, there is also a Special Committee on Violations of the
Human Rights of Parliamentarians which carnies on its work
quite independentîy and in a particular manner within the
organization. It had its genesis during discussions in the
permanent committee, which 1 mentioned a moment ago. of
innumerable examples of human rights violations that were
brought to its attention by various members, when the idea
began to germinate that the IPU should become more proactive and should do something more constructive to discourage or alleviate human rights abuses.
Canada can take some pride in the work of its successive
delegations that ensured that the idea finaîly took hold and
became a reality. Two distinguished former chairmen and
leaders of the Canadian group, the Honourable Gordon Fairweather, P.C., and the Honourable Robert Stanbury, P.C.,
brother of our colleague in the Senate, participated in the
debates.
Our most difficult challenge occurred at the spring conference in Mexico City in 1976. I had originaîly presented a
resolution which, if accepted, would have entailed the setting
up of a committee to deal with specific cases of abuses of the
human rights of people generally. However, we encountered

December 29,1988

DEBATES

stifi opposition from the Soviet bloc of communist countries,
which argued that it would bc a duplication of the efforts of
other tribunals already operating and tberefore an unnecessary
expense ta the union, as well as from otber countries, including
some of our own allies in the union, which were flot keen on
having their human rights records examined by yet another
organization. We decided ta modify our objective, and s0 1
presented an amendment ta oui original resolution whicb had
the effect of confining the investigations of the proposed
committee ta alleged abuses of parliamentarians only. The
resolution stressed:
That protection of tbe rîghts of parliamentarians is the
necessary prerequisite ta enable them ta protect and
promate human rights and fundamental freedoms in their
respective countries, and that, in addition, the representative nature of a Parliament closely depends on the respect
af the rights of tbe members of that Parliament.
We argued very strongly that anything that affected the
rights of parliamentarians had ta be a primary concern of the
lnter-Parliamentary Union; and, after much hectic lobbying,
we finally won the vote by a comfortable margin.
The procedure that the special committee was ta follow was
set out very clearly by the lnter-Parliamentary Council. It was
ta:
examine and treat communications regarding cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment or punishment of
pariliamentarianrs.
It further provided that it was:
applicable ta Members of Parliament wbo are or have
been subjected to arbitrary actions during the exercise of
the mandate entrusted ta them by their voters, whether
the Parliament is sitting, in recess or bas been dissolved as

liamentarian for some 15 days during the former regime in
Argentina, and, after being found, was held in prison under
very abhorrent circumstances for over one year. On his release,
which was effectuated in part through the representations of
the special committee of the IPU, he was exiled in Venezuela
and France for six years before being allowed to return to his
native country. You can appreciate why he has a very real and
personal interest in assuring that the work of the special
committee is as effective as possible.
Since our subcommittee will make a confidential report to
the full committee at its meeting in Geneva at the end of
January, I cannot give any details with respect to it at this
time. I can only say that on closer examination these situations
always seem to be far more complex than they seemed to be
previously, even on the basis of abundant documentation.
However, i am cautiously optimistic that we can look forward
to the release of the parliamentarians involved in the not too
distant future.
Honourable senators, the most recent report which the
special committee presented to the Sofia conference contains
the cases of 52 parliamentarians from eight different countries. They include, for instance, 28 Chilean parliamentarians
who have been exiled for many years and two others who have
simply disappeared; four parliamentarians who have been
assassinated in Colombia in circumstances which give rise to
the suspicion that the police, military personnel and/or intelligence service members may have been actively or tacitly
involved; one parliamentarian in Honduras who was assassinated this year shortly after testifying before the InterAmerican Court of Human Rights in a case concerning four
earlier "disappearances" in his country; and seven parliamentarians who were arrested in Malaysia, five of whom have been
detained without trial for over a year. There are several other
cases of detention under dubious circumstances.
The effectiveness of the Inter-Parliamentary Union in bringing justice to bear in these cases is closely linked with the
efforts of individual national groups and parliaments, and even
individual parliamentarians. The resolution adopted in 1976
stipulates that:
National groups will be required to report to the next
meeting of the Council on ail action taken with respect to
IPU reports on human rights violations against parliamentarians.
Our Canadian group has taken up this challenge. After each
conference we send a copy of the report of the special committee to the Secretary of State for External Affairs for his
information and such action as he considers appropriate. We
meet and keep in touch on a regular basis with the person in
that department who is charged with overseeing ail human
rights matters. Furthermore, we expect to set up a procedure
whereby the Speakers of our two houses will communicate
directly with the Speakers of the parliaments of the countries
involved, conveying not only the concerns of the Parliament of
Canada but their hope that the cases about which they are
communicating will be speedily and happily resolved.

To digress for a moment, I should like to pay a heartfelt and
sincere tribute, in which I am sure all honourable senators will
join, to a distinguished Canadian, Professor John P. Humphrey, Emeritus Professor of International Law at McGill
University, who was recently awarded a United Nations
Human Rights prize on the occasion of the fortieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. He has
for many years been active in the field of international human
rights and was the first director of the United Nations Human
Rights Division. I have just read a long article on his career,
which notes that he was responsible for a great deal of the
preparatory work on and was in fact the author of much of the
final wording of the Universal Declaration, which was adopted
by the United Nations General Assembly in 1948. I have
attended many meetings over which Professor Humphrey has
presided, and he has always appeared to be an inspiration and
example to everyone who has heard him. On behalf of those
who continue to need to have their human rights protected, I
wish Professor Humphrey good health and a long and productive life in order to continue his work in a field where so much
remains to be done.
In closing, I should like to add that occasionally committee
members feel frustration or regret-especially when appeals
are made directly to them on behalf of the many other
prisoners who are not parliamentarians-that their mandate is
not as broad as the one originally sought. We can only hope
that the appeals we make on behalf of parliamentarians to
various countries will have a spillover and beneficial effect for
the others who are being unjustly treated or detained.
In this month of December, when we commemorate the
fortieth anniversary of the United Nations Declaration of
Human Rights, I urge al] honourable senators to read the
report of the special committee, which was annexed as an
appendix to the general report already tabled by Senator
Nurgitz.

CANADA-UNITED STATES FREE TRADE
AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION BILL
REPORT OF COMMITTEE PRESENTED, PRINTED AS APPENDIX
AND ADOPTED

Hon. John B. Stewart: Honourable senators, I have the
honour to present the first report of the Standing Senate
Committee on Foreign Affairs respecting the examination of
Bill C-2, to implement the Free Trade Agreement between
Canada and the United States of America.
I ask that this report be printed as an appendix to the
Minutes of the Proceedings of the Senate and to the Debates
of the Senate of this day and that it form part of the
permanent records of this house.
The Hon. the Speaker: Is it agreed, honourable senators?
Hon. Senators: Agreed.
(For text of report see appendix, p. 100.)
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, when shall this
report be taken into consideration?
Senator Stewart: Honourable senators, with leave of the
Senate and notwithstanding rule 45(l)(f), I move that the
report be adopted now.
The Hon. the Speaker: Is leave granted, honourable
senators?
Hon. Senators: Agreed.
Senator Stewart: Honourable senators, in considering Bill
C-2, which will change the statutory law of Canada in conformity with the terms of the Free Trade Agreement between
Canada and the United States of America, the Standing
Senate Committee on Foreign Affairs was mindful of several
facts.
First, on November 21, 1988, the people of Canada elected
a House of Commons in which the majority favoured the
implementation of the Free Trade Agreement. Bill C-2 is
virtually the same as Bill C-130, which was passed by the
House of Commons on August 31, 1988, in the Thirty-Third
Parliament. Moreover, the committee received Bill C-2 only on
Tuesday, December 27, while the implementation date under
the agreement is January 1, 1989. Those facts pointed to the
conclusion that the committee should not propose amendments
to the bill, even though some members of the committee
believe that, on the merits, major amendments are highly
desirable.

Second, the committee saw that the proclamation of this
new statute and the first deluge of regulations necessary for
the performance of the obligations undertaken by the Government of Canada, although of very great importance, are only
early steps in the long, complicated process begun by the
President of the United States and the Prime Minister a year
ago. This realization led the committee to decide to focus its
work on certain matters which must be dealt with successfully
by the government in the months and years now before us if
the Free Trade Agreement is to have any chance of being
beneficial for most Canadians.
As its report shows, in the limited time available this week
the committee dealt chiefly with five matters. Those matters
are: problems caused for Canadian farmers and food processors by the Free Trade Agreement; problems which will arise
because of the limitations, accepted by Canada, on any future
attempts to maintain a secure supply of energy for Canadians;
the implications of the terms of the agreement dealing with the
temporary admission into Canada of business people and
others to take up employment here; the prospects for an
outcome satisfactory to Canadians, particularly Canadian
export industries, of the negotiations on subsidies; and the
plans of the government for special measures to alleviate
hardships caused to companies and their employees, to towns
and regions, and to provinces by reason of changes caused by
the Free Trade Agreement.
Honourable senators, this is a unanimous report. As the
record shows, some members did not participate in the vote to
carry the clauses of the bill. In the third paragraph on the first
page of the report, which begins with the words, "From the
testimony heard", the committee provides a summary of its
views on each of the five specific matters to which I have
already referred. Honourable senators will notice that the
views set forth in that one paragraph are attributed only to a
majority of the members of the committee.
Both the Honourable John Crosbie and the Honourable
Barbara McDougall were ready to come before the committee.
However, given the facts, first, that the committee does not see
the enactment of Bill C-2 as terminating the process of
implementing the Free Trade Agreement and, second, that the
committee is recommending in this report that it be authorized
to monitor and report on the implications and application of
the agreement, it was decided that it would be more fruitful to
hear the ministers at some time in the future, when Canadians
have had some experience with the consequences of the Free
Trade Agreement, the new statute law and the regulations.
On behalf of the committee I want to tell honourable
senators that we appreciated greatly the efforts of the witnesses who came before the committee and who were most

December 30, 1988SETEDATS8

SENATE DEBATES

helpful. It was service beyond the cail of normal duty between
Christmas and the New Vear. 1 personally want to thank the
members; of the committee for their cooperation.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear!
Motion agreed to and report adopted.
THIRD READING

The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, when shall this
bill be read the third time?
Hon. Lowell Murray <Leader of the Government, Minister
of State for Federal-Provincial Relations and Acting Minister
of Communications): Honourable senators, with leave of the
Senate and notwithstanding rule 45(1 )(b), 1 move that this bill
be read the third time now.
The Hon. the Speaker: Is leave granted, honourable
senators?
Hon. Senators: Agreed.

Hon. Raymond J. Perrault: Honourable senators, this is a
momentous day for Parliament. Perhaps in the history of
Canada, this represents one of the most important initiatives
ever undertaken by a government and considered and debated
by Parliament.
1 should like to be able to say that 1 welcome this measure
with rapturous joy, but 1 am not. 1 think we would ail fled
better had this measure received a much stronger endorsation
in the recent national election. 1 come from a province where
over 60 per cent of the people voted against the government,
primarily because of the trade initiatives represented in this
measure.
( 1310)

Senator Denis: You are not alone!

Senator Perrault: 1 could not remain silent in my place
without expressing my concerns on behaîf of the people of my
province who are gravely worried about the ultimate implications of this measure as far as their welfare is concernied.
Mr. Reisman came to British Columbia a few weeks ago
and he said. in effect. that, in retrospect. he thought it would
have been better if we had been tougher with the Americans
and we had been able to negotiate out of this 15 per cent
impost against softwood lumber in the province of British
Columbia and in other provinces. He regretted that we were
not able to do it. but we had had to put something on the table.
British Columbia derives 50 per cent of its income from our
forest industry, and it is an important element in many other
economies in other provinces across the country. The federal
government collected $423 million under a special export tax
on softwood lumber headed for U.S. markets during 1987 and
the frst three months of 1988. That $423 million impost was a
punitive measure demanded by the U.S. and aimed against the
softwood lumber industry of Canada, without any kind of
rationale behind it. The impost is enshrined forever in our
trade relations with the UJnited States. We could have won

81

remission had we fought more strenuously to eliminate this
unfair burden on certain provinces of this country.
A few weeks ago I asked one person in the forest industry
why he supports this trade deal, when it looks as though we are
not going to be able to extricate ourselves from this 15 per cent
impost. He said. "Frankly, we are afraid that, if we do not
support it. we are going to get something worse." What a
reason to support a measure-"if we do not vote for it, we are
going to get something worse!"
Yes, and President Reagan said the other day that he has
decided to maintain the tariff on Canadian cedar shakes and
shingles, which is another measure aimed at an important
sector of the industry in Canada. Free trade? This is not the
definition of free trade that 1 have supported for years. We
may have a free trade deal in words, but in actual fact it does
not mean anything so far as certain industries are concerned.
Members of this chamber and the other place have talked in
terms of implementing the findings of the Macdonald commission on Canada's economy. The Honourable Donald Macdonald bas been cited as a great supporter of this trade deal. 1
hope that senators read the article in the Globe and Mail a few
days ago by Mr. J. G. Godsoe, the Halifax lawyer who was
executive director of the Macdonald commission on Canada's
economy. He came out against the Free Trade Agreement and
said that this was not the trade deal recommended by the
Macdonald commission; there are serious omissions.
Honourable senators, we talk in terms of the skills of our
negotiating team and how our canny Canadian negotiating
team outmaneuvered the Americans. Mr. Reisman bas said on
more than one occasion that somne of the Americans did not
know what they were doing.
In the October 22, 1987, edition of The Toronto Star there
was a story, wbich was also carried in other publications,
saying that Clayton Yeutter, the U.S. trade representative
with a reputation for insensitivity towards Canada, is reported
to have boasted to top American officiaIs that Canada
emerged the big loser in the negotiations. He is quoted as
fol Iows:
The Canadians don't understand what they have
signed. In 20 years, they will be sucked into the U.S.
economy. So-called -knowledgeable" U.S. sources quoted
Yeutter as telling senior treasury department officiais
that these remarks were made after the free-trade deal
was reached earlier this month. (October, 1987)
Yeutter allegedly made the remark in the so-called "heady
hours immediately following the marathon two-day negotiating session that produced the final agreement". 0f course,
ultimately Yeutter denied making such comments. He said,
"They are absolutely false. They represent the exact opposite
of my thinking.- However, to quote the Star, "the U.S.
sources, who asked not to be named, are considered impeccable. They were heavily involved in the talks, are extremely
close to the U.S. Treasury Secretary, James Baker, and were
privy to confidential conversations and documents."

SENATE DEBATES
SENATE DEBATES
The report has neyer been offîcially denied by the U.S.
governiment.
Honourable senators, there are valid concernis about the
deal. Vet some of those who have opposed this deal have been
accused of traitorous conduct. Somehow they are seen as
acting against the best intcrests of Canada, yet perhaps they
have a right ta feel concerncd.
Honourable senators, this is what the Right Honourable
Brian Mulroney said about free trade in 1987:
It's terrific until the elephant twitches, and if it ever rais
over, you're a dead man..
This country could flot survive with a policy of unfettered free trade. l'm ail in favour of eliminating unfair
protectianism, where it exists. This is a separate country.
Wc'd be swamped. We have in many ways a branch-plant
economy, in many ways, in certain important sectors. AIl
that would happen wjth that kind of concept would be the
boys cranking up their plants throughout the United
States in bad times and shutting their entire branch plants
in Canada. lt's bad enough as it is ...
We have neyer had an explanation fram Mr. Mulroney
about his incredible reversai of position, which took place
within a few weeks of his attaining the office of Prime
Minister of this country. No wonder Canadians are concerned!
The Minister of Finance has said:
Bilateral free trade with the United States is simplistic
and naive. It would only serve ta further diminish aur
ability ta campete internationally.
In recent years spokesman after spokesman for the Conservative Party has apposed this agreement as being absoluteiy
cantrary ta Canadian national interests. Perhaps Canadians
have a right ta feel cancerned. Honourable senators, 1 quote
from a book entitled "The Discipline of Power", which was
written by Gearge Bail, the farmer U.S. Undersecretary of
State:
Canada, 1 have long believed, is fighting a rearguard
actian against the inevitable. Living next ta aur nation,
with a population ten times as large as theirs and a grass
national product fourteen times as great. the Canadians
recognize their need for United States' capital: but at the
same time they are determined ta maintain their economic and political independence. Their position is understandablegraciausly says Mr. Bailand their desire ta maintain their national integrity is a
worthy objective. But the Canadians pay heavily for it,
and over the years, I do not believe they will succeed in
reconciîing the intrinsic contradictions of their position . .. The struggle is bound ta be a difficult one-and I
suspect, aver the years. a losing anc.
Senator Murray: When did he say that?
Senator Perrault: He made that statement in 1968.
Senator Doody: As recently as that!

Senator Perrault: But it is consistent with statements made
by representatives of the United States over the years, up ta
and including the eighties.
Honourable senators, during the last election campaign 1
rcceivcd a letter from a businessman in Washington, D.C.,
who works for a multinational corporation. In that letter he
said, "Senator, I used ta vote for yau years aga.- That may
reflect upon his judgmentSenator Doody: That may reflect upon his memory!
Senator Perrault: -but he went an ta say that he interfaces
with American senators and congressmen and, ta a man, it is
their view that the Frec Trade Agreement, particularly the
energy sector of it, is the best piece of U.S. negotiating ever
undertaken. They dlaim that within two years the balance of
trade in Canada's favour will bc totally and massively
reversed. He said, -Ail I want you ta do is write me and
reassure me that that is flot true."
Honourable senators, there is good reason for Canadian
concern. I for one hope that this deal works out well for the
country. 1 did flot came here today ta be negative about it, but
Canadians who have apposed this agreement have real and
realistic concernis. Honourable senators, 1 have neyer rcceived
more mail on any subject than 1 have rccived in recent weeks
an this trade deal-aIl from concerned Canadians.
Mr. Reisman, again in anc of his frequent press conferences,
said that, in retrospect, it would have been better ta have
included a special section on the subject of social servicesmedical insurance, hospital care and s0 on. Yes, we should
have donc that. Before this measure camne ta the Scnate for
final passage wc should have reccived from the government an
assurance that certain amendmnents ta this agreement would be
made. That would have reassured Canadians on points of
concern.
I can anly say that, if there is vast misunderstanding in the
country and a gencral lack of knowledge about the trade deal,
the blame rests solely with the government.
I would remind senators of the report made public on
September 20, 1985. The contents of certain documents wcre
made public at that time. They werc preparcd in the Prime
Minister's Office under the direction of William Fox, Press
Secretary ta the Prime N4inister, and the task farce included
senior bureaucrats such as Peter Daniel, then Director General
af Communications in the Department of Finance. The program caîled for the Prime Minister ta focus exclusively an the
passible benefits of free trade. It calîed on him ta avoid
mentianing passible job lasses.
I shaîl not go through them, but I have before me public
reports of the job lasses that have accurred s0 far, attributable
in very large measure ta the imminence of the free trade deal.

Prime Minister was extremely worried about how the Ontario
government reacted, suggesting any sustained opposition
".could jeopardize national support" for the talks.
1 should like to quote from the document.
It is likely that the higher the profile the issue obtains. the
iower the degree of public approval will be.
The document went on to say:
The strategy should rely less on educating the general
public than on getting across the message that the trade
initiative is a good idea. ln other words, a selling job.
Honourable senators, it is no wonder that 70 per cent of the
Canadian people today admit that they do not understand the
trade deal. The Conservative information operation was
designed to keep public interest at a low level to avoid the
forming of any coalition of groups opposing free trade; they
were not successfui.
As the paper said, and again 1quote from it:
Benign negiect from a majority of Canadians may be the
realistic outcome of a weli-executed (Conservative) communications program. In these circumstances, it appears
that the best strategy for the Government is to adopt a
iow profile approach to the generai public whiie dealing
with the specîfic concerns of interest groups on an
individual basis.
The memorandum expressed the hope that Canadians would
become bored with the free trade issue and leave it in Ottawa's
hands; otherwise, it was feared that public opinion would shift
dramaticaiiy.
i shouid like to quote again from the report, and this is
exactly the strategy, Mr. Leader of the Government, that you
and your colleagues foilowed:
The public support generated should be recognized as
extremeiy soft and iikely to evaporate rapidly if the
debate is ailowed to get out of contraI so as to erode the
central focus of the message. At the same time. a substantial majority of the public may bc willing ta leave the
issue in the hands of the Government and other interested
groups if the Government maintains communications control of the situation.
The whoie operation has been designed to keep the Canadian people in ignorance with respect to the details of this trade
deai. How can one explain the failure of a parlîamentary
committee gaing to ail] provinces before this measure became
iaw? It is ail right to say that there were committee hearings
on free trade; they were generai. We wanted, and we should
have had, pariiamentary committee hearings-pubic hearîngs-fram coast to coast on the details of this measure, givîng
equal time to tbe opposition and those who support the idea.
Instead, there was a deliberate attempt to muzzle the opportunity for Canadians to speak out and to appear before the
committee. As a British Columbian, I resent that fact. The
oniy hearings held were held in Ottawa. I wonder if the Leader
of the Government understands how much it costs to get from
British Columbia to Ottawa to express one's outrage or sup-

port for a proposed government measure. 0f course. most of
the committee hearings were heid in the heat of summer when
people were away on holiday. There was a carefully selected
list of witnesses. This was information cantrol of the worst
kind. and it is not to the credit of the government.
With regard to the use of closure, ciosure has been used like
a biudgeon in this parliamentary debate. One writer said that
John Diefenbaker wiil be twirling in his grave because of the
misuse of ciosure in this discussion. The use of closure and the
restricted parliamentary debate on the trade deal are entireiy
consistent. however, with the Conservatives' communication
strategy, to which I referred a few moments ago. How else can
one explain the fact that the most important economic measure ever to be proposed in this country was debated for a
scandaiously short time prior to the election? Before the
election the Commons had spent oniy 14 or 15 days deaiing
with the trade proposais. One of the members said, "We've
spent more time discussing the federal tax on dog food than we
have on this measure."
We cal] that enlightened democracy? When Britain went
into the European Common Market, it took about six years,
and they ultimately had a referendum to decîde whether or not
the people appràved of it. You mention "referendum" in this
Parliament and the government members express outrage and
fright that the system might become -riddled with
democracy".
In the other place ciosure was used four times in recent
days. What was the explanation by the Leader of the Government in the other place? Well, he said. "There have not been
too many editorials about our use of closure. We haven't had
too many phone caîls from the people out there"-ali Christmas shopping, of course---:so we wili keep on using ciosure
just as long as we can. until people start protesting."
The Globe and Mail-and one of our hanourable senators
used ta be with the Globe and Mail, that great Tory journal of
national thought and opinion-what did it say about closure
and free speech in Parliament? When a previous measure
came ta the Senate in 1956, an editariai in the Globe and Mail
stated:
Are the senators merely, as sometimes claimed. political pensioners? Are they just serving time? If so, they will
do as the Gavernment wishes them to do. They wiii rush
the bill through with littie or no discussion so that it can
have Royal Assent by the Government's target date, June
7.

That is exactly what this government has asked Parliament
ta do in both chambers. The Globe and Mail stated that the
senators had a right ta stand up where the national and
regionai interest was at stake and present the concerns and
views of the people.
Yet, in the other place, Mr. Crosbie accused our opposition
leader of heing traitorous in his insistence that the Senate duiy
consider this measure.
An Hon. Senator: Shame!

Senator Perrault: He was attacked by the Prime Minister,
who accused the Senate of holding it up; it was suggested that
we had no valid role. If ever the Senate had a role to slow
down passage of a bill, and to ensure that aIl aspects of this
trade deal were discussed, it was in this instance.
On May 24, 1956, the Globe and Mail went on to say:
But if they take their powers and responsibilities seriously,
if they seek to perform the function the Upper House was
created to perform, they will refuse to jump throughthe government's hoop.

More than a few people have said to me, "The attacks on
vour leader during the election campaign make me wonder
how they can allow language like that to be spoken in Parliament." My reply to them is, "Of course we would not allow
language like that in Parliament!" You cannot get up in
Parliament and accuse another member of being a traitor or a
liar. But that is what the Conservative Party did in its last
bunker attempt to save the election-it used language that
could not have been used in this chamber, paid for by the
massive amount of dollars poured into the propaganda coffers
from aIl across the country.

Senator Doody: What was the date on that?
Senator Perrault: That article appeared in the great Conservative Globe and Mail in 1956.
Mr. Stanfield had another quotation along the same lines.
He said:
Closure is not applied against the Opposition. It is
directed against Parliament as a whole, and when its use
is in such form as makes a mockery of Parliament and
when Government supporters abandon their prerogatives
as representatives of the people, there are no voices left
but those in Opposition to speak for freedom.
So much for the Conservative-Lewis tactic in the other
place. Closure has never been used on a scale in Canada the
way it is being used now. It is time for some of our opinion
leaders to recognize just how bad the situation really is. Talk
about John Diefenbaker and his condemnation of closure!
Here was a rare and significant opportunity for Parliament,
in conjunction with the communications industry, to help
educate the Canadian people about a major, new, national
policy initiative which would touch upon their lives and the
lives of their children. Instead, the government chose another
course: concealment, limitation of debate, the use of closure,
and, in conjunction with the free trade advocacy groups, a
massive misuse of millions of dollars to affect the outcome of
the recent election.
During the election campaign I had a call from one businessman in British Columbia protesting to me about the
inordinate demands being made upon him to support what was
described as "one last push to victory for the Conservative
Party". He was asked for several, "bonus", thousands of
dollars to support one of the groups advocating free trade, and,
in effect, the Conservative campaign.
Honourable senators, it will be my firm intention to
introduce a bill in this chamber to end this kind of sly,
unprincipled, shattering of the election spending rules, whether
it is by one party or any of the parties. Technically, the
activities of the advocacy groups may be legal, but they defeat
the very purpose of our efforts to achieve fairness and equity in
the matter of campaign funding, and they certainly offend the
concept of fair play. Indeed, the limitation of spending by
advocacy groups during a campaign period and the limitation
of public-opinion polling during elections are two reforms
badly needed in this country. I will do my best either to initiate
or to support actions in both areas.
|Senartor P'erraulid

The attacks on the Liberal leader and the language used in
those attacks by the Conservative Party during the campaign
were a shame to the system. Any senator who stood in his
place in this chamber and accused another senator of treason,
of disloyalty or lying would be asked to withdraw such
remarks or he or she would be asked to withdraw from the
chamber. I am wondering whether the Conservative Party is
really proud of its campaign performance and, for example, its
attempt to pit Ontario against Quebec in the trade deal
dialogue. Honourable senators opposite know that happened.
There were Conservative Party representatives present at
the Republican Convention earlier this year. It would have
been good for Canada if they had brought back with them
something in the way of constructive policies instead of political dirty tricks.
In recent months the opposition members in this chamber
have sustained a great deal of abuse. Accusations of obstructionism have been screamed at us by the Prime Minister and a
number of his colleagues. To say the least, their target-shooting has been wildly erratic. I shall never forget the occasion
when, a few weeks ago, the Prime Minister accused the Senate
of delaying the passage of the child care bill, when, at the time
of his outraged denunciation, the bill had not even arrived in
the Senate! Perhaps that was his version of "anticipating
trouble". No matter; the tactic was part of the great governmental political smear against the Senate.
Honourable senators, it is to be hoped that in time the
government will understand that the Senate has a responsibility to the regions of Canada, and particularly where a major
issue is involved that could alter profoundly the very nature of
the nation. We have a particular responsibility to raise the
profile of an issue so that public opinion can be alerted and the
necessary actions taken and questions raised before that proposed measure becomes law.
In my view, and in the view of most Canadians, the Senate
has acted reasonably and responsibly in recent months, during
this entire trade deal dialogue and controversy. We had an
absolute responsibility to sound warnings and concerns, and
this report contains, in essence, the Senate's concerns about
the measure. We were right in delaying the passage of the
implementing legislation until an election was called.
Honourable senators, having said ail of that, I hope that the
measure works well for Canada. I hope that it is advantageous

flot only for the region in which 1 live but for every other
region of the country. 1 hope that the government, in the spirit
of conciliation which the Prime Minister pledged after the
election, will report regularly to Parliament with respect to the
barmonization negotiations and the other free trade negotiations that will take place in the coming years. This is absolutely essential for the nation and if we are ta heal some of the
wounds which were inflicted in recent months, and particularly
during the campaign.
Somne Hon. Senators: Hear, hear!
Hon. Peter A. Stollery: Honourable senators, 1 sbould like
ta make a few remarks before this agreement passes into
history in this chamber. First, 1 must say tbat 1 arn not a
persan who is opposed ta freer trade or ta expanding Canada's
trade possibilities. When the Macdonald commission issued its
report, 1 read that report and found il very intercsting. 1 say
that because the Macdonald commission report bas been used
very much as an intellectual basis for this Free Trade
Agreement.
One of the characteristics of the word "skepticism", according ta my Websier's Dictionary of DiscriminaiedSynonyms, is
that the word refers ta something proposed for belief. The Free
Trade Agreement debate bas really aIl been about belief, and
belief, of course, implies strong elements of "in spite of the
facts".
Honourable senators, 1 have served an the Standing Senate
Committee an Foreign Affairs ever since this debate started,
and onc of the beliefs that bas been referred to-wbat 1 might
caîl the original belief-is that we require the Free Trade
Agreement witb the United States because of rising U.S.
protectionism. That belief was first stated in the Macdonald
report in a way that gives it some substance. However, the fact
is that. no malter how well the Canadian authorities attempted
ta pick witnesses for our Senate Foreign Affairs Commitîc
wben we visited Washington, only the Canadian ambassador
said that there was rising U.S. protectianism. Every U.S.
witness was surprised at tbat nation. Mr. Julius Katz, the
distinguished former Assistant Secretary of State for Economic and Business Affairs, cbaracterized that intellectual basis,
the view that there was broad support in the United States
generally and in Congress specifically for protectianist trade
policies, as a grass mischaracterization. 1 think it is important
tbat we understand that point. AIl the witnesses we heard who
were from the United States and were in favour ai free trade
agreed that protectionism was, if anything, on the decline in
the United States. At one point Mr. Katz said that he believed
that Congressman Gephardt's failure in bis run for tbe Demacratic leadership resulted from having chosen tbe wrong issue,
which was protectianism. So tbe belief and the fact on that
basic reason for the necessity of the Free Trade Agreement are
very much apart.
Another belief, based again on the Macdonald commission
report, that is very current is the need for sametbing ta resalve
the issue af non-tariff barriers, and mare and more this need
bas been put forth as tbe reason for a special binatianal
agreement witb the Americans. That reasoning, which bas

EAE

been repeated time and again. can bc found in chapters five
and six of the Royal Commission on the Economic Union and
Development Prospects for Canada. In that same volume of
the Macdonald commission report it is stated, on page 296,
under "Conclusions":
Commissioners believe that multilateral trade negotiations under the GATT should remain a central theme ai
Canadian trade policy.
The fact is that that bas nat bappened, and I will camne back ta
tbis point in just a moment. Tbis point revalves around the
dispute-settlement mecbanism, which your cammittee looked
at in great detail. bath in Washington and in Canada. The
flaws in the dispute-settlement mecbanism were discussed by
the committee with Congressman Gibbons, who bas been the
leading U.S. political figure in this matter, in Washington.
Congressman Gibbons made the chilling reality very clear in
bis discussions with the committee. As yau ail know, the
dispute-settlement mecbanism is faîrly complex. However, it
bas flaws and everyone agrees that is bas flaws. Congressman
Gibbons said that, if Canada were not satisfied, they could
invoke the six-manth cancellation clause.
e(1340)

Honourable senators, 1 have flot made up my own mind
whether it will ever be possible for Canada ta invake the
six-month cancellation clause, but many knawledgeable
Canadians say that it will be impossible for us ever ta do tbat
because ai the obviaus structural changes that will bave taken
place in a significant number ai Canadian praducing-exporting
industries, adapting tbemselves ta this Free Trade Agreement.
Congressman Gibbons tells us that, if we are flot satisfied with
a ruling or with sometbing that will bappen ta us in the future,
this is what it bouls down ta: We will bave ta invoke sometbing
that will be mucb casier for the Americans ta invoke, because,
as trading partners, we are much less important ta themn than
tbey are ta us. Any negotiator can understand that the sixmonth cancellation clause in an agreement between twa very
unequal trading partners is a capout. It is something ta be used
much more easily by tbe stronger trading partner than by the
weaker trading partner.
In cammittee yesterday we bad even more interesting information on the question ai the dispute-settlement mecbanism,
which is the guts ai this agreement, and aIl that it entails. An
expert witness, Mr. Mcl Clark, informed the committee that,
although the agreement gives the impression that if we now
have a dispute with the United States we can apt for cither the
GATT dispute-settlement procedure, wbich bas worked very
well for us and is inexpensîve, or the new Frc Trade Agreement procedure, wbich involves U.S. lawyers and may be very
expensive. The agreement is laccd with these unstated facts on
situations that flanc ai us could ever know about unless we
were specialists in a very large number ai areas.
As Mr. Clark explained ta us. since 1949 GATT bas had a
policy ai flot intervening in disputes between parties ta a
binational agreement so that the references in the agreement
ta the fact that Canada still bas an option are simply flot rîght.
The agreement reduces aur options. It takes options away from

SENATE DEBATES
SENAE
us. It takes the option of the dispute-settlement procedure of
the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade away from us
and replaces it, but it does not stipulate that it is doing so. This
is directly contrary to the advice of the Macdonald commission, which was that Canada should maintain GATT as its
principal international agreement.
Honourable senators, the agreement is filled with these
secret corners, and i must say that i concur with the observations of Senator Perrault about the speed with which this
fundamentai change in our trading approach-the one that we
have developed since the end of World War I-is being
rushed through Parliament. Here we are at almost two o'clock
on this Friday afternoon before the New Year's weekendunder the gun, you might say, to have ail this wrapped up in
the next few minutes. It is really unacceptable! i do not think
anything like this has ever happened in Canada before. To
emphasize the point, I must say that this government has lost
ail sense of the fact that parliaments are run by some agreement among the people to make them run.
Senator Bosa: By consensus.
Senator Stollery: As Senator Bosa says, it has to be run "by
consensus".
I remember the advice of my leader, Senator MacEachen,
many years ago, when he said to us-and it was not a political
observation, Senator Murray, it" was an observation about
Parliament-that Parliament is run by consent, the consent of
the members to make it run. That is the difference between
Canada and countries which, for ail of their histories, have
never been able to make their parliaments run. They have
never understood that there must be a general consensus by
the people and by parliament to make it run. Because that
consensus has been so abused by this government ever since it
was elected, we have-and every member feels it-a lessening
of the consensus in this country. The agreement, honourable
senators, is filled with secret corners, and it is unfortunate that
under this spurious deadline we have no time to look more
carefully into them in the interests of the country.
For example, in chapter 15, which deals with temporary
entry for business persons, a list of professionais categories
appears. We ail understood that this list of professionals and
the need for professionals to come in and out of Canada and
the United States was related to trade matters. We understood
they would be people, for example, who were selling something, servicing something or were, for some reason, required
to stay in Canada more than a few hours or a couple of days,
and that therefore there had to be this section in the agreement. However, when you look carefully at chapter 15 you
discover that there is a long list of professionals, such as
dentists, registered nurses, veterinarians, teachers and university professors. According to the evidence that we have heard,
these people will be allowed into Canada for up to two years.
We were told by witnesses on behalf of the government that
these people would be able to replace, for example. a Canadian
professor who might be on sabbatical leave. Under the Free
Trade Agreement they would be able to avoid totally the rules
and regulations of the Immigration Act.

It is not very difficult to see that, more and more. it is not
only a trade agreement but is an intellectual agreement. Under
that particular section we are giving rights to U.S. professionais that we give to no other professionals in the worid. If i were
in the academic community, honourable senators, i would be
very concerned about that section of the Free Trade
Agreement.
The greatest belief in ail of this year of either believing or
not believing is the belief that on Monday or Tuesday. or
whenever it is, we wili have a free trade agreement in force,
when, in fact, what we will have is the outline of a free trade
agreement coming into force next week. The real agreement,
honourable senators, will be decided over the next five to seven
years, when the subsidy issue is decided.
I would refer you to an observation made at page 286 of the
Macdonald commission report:
The United States sees a need to develop rules which will
penalize governments for intervening in its economy in
order to meet particular social and political goals.
S(135O

i have not heard any reference to it by a representative of the
government over the past year. This is particularly important
as we now have the five- to seven-year period, starting in the
month of January, when what is and what is not a subsidy will,
in fact, be discussed.
Members of the government, supporters of the government,
and supporters of the agreement, do not seem worried about
our various social and health programs and the fact that the
Americans do not have a national unemployment insurance
program. i use unemployment insurance and the medical
program because they are the two most obvious ones, the ones
that we ail know, but there is a vast number of other programs
and there is no question that the future of those programs is
not decided by passing the framework of this agreement. The
future of those programs will be decided over the next five to
seven years. My goodness! What is the government's response
to that problem? Well, it has the de Grandpré adjustment
committee, which ends its work in May, before the adjustment
problem even starts. How can the adjustment problem start
before the question of subsidies has, in a general way, been
decided over the next five to seven years? Yet the government's response to that is to appoint a committee, a kind of
bumf committee, that ends its work in May, before the problems even start.
So, honourable senators, not only am i a skeptic among the
believers who support this government but i must say that I
have become increasingly skeptical about the role of Canadian
business in this debate. i realize that it is the end of the week,
but I did get some of the trading statistics out when I thought
I would make a few comments pressed into this late hour on a
Friday afternoon. Business has come out of this, honourable
senators, with a great loss of respect. In the election campaign,
business in Canada involved itself in such activities that, when
I try to think of autocratic régimes that would allow business
to conduct massive campaigns on behalf of their dictators, the

only one 1 can think of is in Chule, where the business
community acted on behalf of General Pinochet in the last
plebiscite, which 1 had the luck to watch. 1say -luck", because
it was interesting. The business community in Chule, representing General Pinochet, acted in exactly the samne manner as the
business community in Canada, spending millions of dollars to
support tbis agreement.
An Hon. Senator: Fascists!
Senator Stollery: 1 did not say that it was a fascist business
community, and 1 do not think that, but 1 do believe that it
acted in a reprehensible fashionSenator Frith: Hear, hear!
Senator Stollery: -a fashion acceptable in no democratic
country.
Senator Frith: That is right.
Senator Stollery: 1 know rather a lot of countries rather
well, perhaps a hundred or more, and the only example that
comes to my mmnd is the business community which massively
supported General Pinochet in the plebiscite in Chile.
In regard to the business community and its desperation for
this agreement, if you look through our export trading figures
you will find that, in trade with a country like China, Australia is third, whereas we are thirteenth, even though 1 believe
we recognized China before Australia did. With the Soviet
Union, Canada is the twenty-ninth largest trading partner of
the developed, capitalist countries. Only Greece bas less trade
with the Soviet Union. With Japan, we are the ninth largest
trading part.ner. 1 arn sure that if you Iooked at those figures
you would find that, while we are the ninth and there are only
eight other countries obviously ahead of us, some of which are
much smaller than we are, if it were flot for our role as a
supplier of raw materials to Japan, we would flot even be
ninth.
However, the hour is growing late and 1 thank honourable
senators for being patient enough to listen to me. when on the
minds of many of them are, 1 know, the departures of trains
and airplanes. Thank you very much.
Hon. Len Marchand: Honourable senators, 1 arn going to
take only a few minutes. 1 recaîl a big debate one Christmas
time in the 1970s. Although 1 cannot remember the exact
year, it was when 1 was part of the Trudeau government. We
were discussing an issue of such great importance that the
opposition had to keep us over the Christmas period for it, and
the late Don Jamieson said something like this: "When the
country is up to its armpits in jingle belîs, 1 do not know how
many people are listening."
1 know there bas been a great deal of concern in the country
about the whole issue of this Free Trade Agreement, and flot
ail of the issues were artîculated during the election campaign
period. Certainly, one group of people whose interests were flot
articulated during the period of the election campaign were
the aboriginal peoples of this country. Senator Adams raised a
few questions the other day in the debate on second reading in

relation to the northern areas especially and more directly to
the Inuit people, and 1 commend him for that.
A number of questions were brought to my attention by the
Assembly of First Nations, and, if the minister, John Crosbie,
had appeared before the commîîtee, 1 would have brought
them to, his attention. It is flot my intention to raise aIl of the
questions now, but I do want to highlight a couple of the areas
about which the aboriginal peoples are generally concerned.
One of the biggest boosts to Indian and non-Indian economies will be the seutlement of land dlaims to nearly two-thirds
of the land mass of Canada. Concern, backed by some legal
opinion, bas been expressed that benefits from land dlaims
used to support business development may be construed as
subsidies and therefore subject to, countervail. How does the
government address this concern? Or, is it clear that such
land-claim benefits flow from aboriginal and treaty rights
protected by sections 25 and 35 of the Canadian Constitution?
The treaty-making prerogative of the federal Crown is clear.
What is flot clear is just how outstanding treaty obligations,
like those to Indian peoples, will fare in light of the new
obligations stemming from the FTA. Will such outstanding
treaty obligations be honoured first, before other obligations
such as assistance to companies and to communities having to
adjust to the FTA?
Honourable senators, this is the basis, the nub, the most
important area of concerni that we have relating to the FTA. I
know there bas been a lot of rhetoric on both sides-rhetoric
that perhaps bas become just a little far-fetched. However, I
hope you do flot think I amn extending the concerns I have
raised into an area that could be thought to be far-fetched.
They may be far-fetched to some of you, but not to us. We
fear that this Free Trade Agreement, which is alI-pervasive
and aIl-encompassing, can have some impact on our communities, particularly in the settlement of some outstanding land
dlaims in aIl parts of the country, and especially the large
number of outstanding land dlaims in the Northwest Territories. My colleague Senator Adams referred Io these the other
day.
Honourable senators, I just want 10 say that, as a western
Canadian who bas been elected to the House of Commons over
three terms, I campaigned many times on the basis of being a
free trader. 1arn a free trader, but I have some fears regarding
this agreement. I do flot think it is a good agreement for
Canada. We could have done better. But be that as it may, we
made the commitment and the people have spoken. I only hope
that we have done it right. I want to say that the peoples in the
aboriginal communities will be watching, as I arn sure aIl
Canadians will, the effects of this agreement on our peoples
and on our communities.

[English]
Nevertheless, 1 should like ta take a few minutes ta express
my feelings about this deal. 1 arn saddened about what wiIl
happen in the future as a result of this week, although it is part
of the political life of aur party system that caucus decides,
and those of us who have lived with caucuses for a number of
years know what it means flot only ta the caucus but ta the
party and ta the parliamentary system.
The leadership of the Liberal Party in the Senate made a
commitment back in July or August that it would flot pass this
bill until there was an election. In hindsight. we might have
been more specific and said unless a majority of the people in
Canada voted for free trade, but we did flot do that. 1 came
from a small province in Canada where 35 per cent of the
population is French speaking and the balance is English
speaking, and in my province this deal was debated at length.
0f course, the Leader of the Government in the Senate and
the Prime Minister have always said that the deal had the
support of eight premiers, but it makes you wonder, when, in
spite of a very popular Liberal premier supporting free trade in
my province, over 60 per cent of New Brunswickers voted
against the government, primarily because of free trade.
Senator Murray: He was not supporting the government; he
was supparting free trade.
Senator Thériault: It gives you an idea of the deep feeling
that there is in New Brunswick.
Senator Murray: How did Premier McKenna vote? He was
not supportîng the government; he was supporting free trade.
Senator Thériault: Anything else?
Senator Perrault: Carry on, Canada!
Senator Thériault: The situation is the same throughout the
maritimes-in Newfoundland, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick
and P.E.l. During the campaign there was a lot of talk about
fear, and 1 arn one of those who fear this agreement. 1 have
risen today ta make those rernarks because 1 want my children
and grandchildren ta know 30 years from now, if things
transpire as 1 think they may, that 1 stood up and said what 1
believed. When they ask me, -Where were you?-, 1 arn going
ta have ta explain ta them that 1 did not vote against the deal
but that 1 abstained. I arn gaing ta abstain, as 1 did earlier this

Honourable senators, we Acadians know what the word
ý1assimilation" means. Thousands of aur people went ta the
United States and what happened ta them? Within two generatians, they completely lost their mother tangue.
When 1 see what happened in Canada during the election
campaign, 1 am even more frightened. What regions supported
this agreement? Only two Canadian provinces gave majority
support ta the agreement on November 21, 1988, namely
Quebec and Alberta.
The actions of the goverfiments of these provinces do not
show that they are totally devoted ta Canadian patriotisrn.
That is their right. Most people in Quebec are Quebecers first

and then Canadians. We heard talk of separatism fram
Quebec and Alberta. not from the other provinces. This agreement suits people who think that way.
1 conclude by saying that 1 hope with all my heart that my
fears as a Canadian and a parliamentarian will not be realized.
Because as you know, within 20 years, as Parizeau said and
Bourassa said indirectly, it will be casier ta obtain separation
or sovereignty-assaciat ion with the Free Trade Agreement
than without it.
Having admitted this. the twa main achievements of the
Mulroney gaverfiment are the decentralizatian of the national
government's power ta the provinces and the weakening of the
Canadian government's power with respect ta aur sauthern
neighbours.
[Englishj
Honourable senators, 1 hope that my fears do flot came truc.
When we talked about social programs during the election
campaign as they related to the FTA, 1 believed everything
that was said. The Prime Minister brought his own mother
forward ta show us that he was flot going ta take away her
pension. 1 neyer bel ieved that people of my generation would
lose their pensions; but 1 arn concerned about the effect that
the agreement will have because of the pressure that was
brought ta bear by the many companies-God knows how
much pressure they used during the campaign-ta make sure
that the Free Trade Agreement would came about. When they
have ta compete with the American campanies in a different
system. over the years it will be the American system that will
prevail.
As a Canadian who has travelled throughout the United
States and has a lot of respect for the United States, having
many cousins who live there, 1 do not want ta see the kind of
paverty in Canadian cities that 1 see when 1 go ta Washington,
New York, Philadelphia, Las Angeles or any of the other large
cities. Thank God it is not like that in Canada. 1 hope that my
fears prove groundless. but 1 arn having a hard time even
abstaining and flot voting "no" on this deal.
Somne Hon. Senators: Hear, hear!
Hon. Ann Elizabeth Bell: Honourable senators, 1 should like
ta make one or two points about Bill C-2, which 1 assume we
are going ta give third reading ta this afternoon. Bill C-2,
which wiIl implement free trade, provides for tariff reductions
and the elimination of trade barriers. In that Bill C-2 is
implementing the Free Trade Agreement, it has my support
and, 1 assume, the support of most Canadians, because
Canadians are free traders; aur whole history proves that.
However, gaing beyond the fact that Bill C-2 implements the
Free Trade Agreement, it is forcing us into an economnic union
with the United States, starting with the opening up ta the
United States of aur natural resources, which will be accessible, including energy and water-so far, and allowing direct
takeovers of Canadian companies, with no protection for
strategic campanies.

December 30. 1988

Honourable senators, 1 have seen nothing that would protect
a company of strategic importance to Canada frorn being
subject to a direct foreign takeover. The Free Trade Agreement provides that the threshold for direct acquisitions will be
raised to S150 million. Sorneone-1 think it was the distinguished Canadian economist, Mr. E.L.R. Williamson-recently said that there is no corporate lawyer worth bis sait who
couldn't break a company down into segrnents worth $150
million eacb.
I wish we had more time to deal with certain other aspects
of Bill C-2, honourable senators, but that is wisbful thinking,
indeed, on my part. 1 do flot feed that I have any responsibility
for the gavernment's deadline of January 1-that is the government's deadline. We in this chamber do flot have a responsibility to the government; our responsibility is to the people of
Canada. I think we should have the tirne to make sure that this
implementing legislation bas ail of its 1's" dotted and its 't's"
crossed. I would flot buy car insurance without reading the
small print in more detail than we have had time to consider in
our exarnination of this document.
Honourable senators, 1 cannot support this bill at third
reading, and it is for this reason: I find the dispute-settling
rnechanism disappoînting in the extreme. 1 know we have gone
on about this at length, but what it really boils down to is twa
alternatives-the termination of the agreement or retaliation
on the part of Canada. The "binding" part of this dispute-settling mechanism is mîssing. It sbould provide a remedy or
ensure compliance, and it does ricither. As I have said, our
only options are to terminate the agreement-which, as Senator Stollery clearly pointed out, is flot practical--or to retaliate. I cannot think of any way in which Canada can retaliate
so that the United States would even notice, unless we decided
to divert the Columbia River, which would be in contravention
of another treaty. In my view the dispute-settling mechanism
is flot really a practical solution at aIl. It is flot really what this
country needs in such a comprehensive agreement.
Having said that, and having said wby I cannot support Bill
C-2 at third reading, I should like to say that, should the bill
receive Royal Assent, I shaîl do everything in rny power to
help the goverfiment make this treaty work. AIl Canadians wiIl
be in this tagether. We must act in the most unified way we
possibly can to defend Canada's interests. That I pledge.
[Translation]

Hon. Azellus Denis: Honourable senators, I only bave a few
words to say to you.
I have but one regret: to be involved in my party's promise
to let this infamous bill pass because of the Conservative
majority.
[English]

Hon. P. Michael Pitfield: Honourable senators, 1 regret
that I ar nfot able to support this bill. 1arn a free trader, but it
is abundantly clear that this is flot a good agreement for
Canada. Furtherrnore. it is flot accompanied by adequate
supporting measures. It is flot conducive to--to the contrary, it

will undermine-the developmnent of Canada as a united and
sovereign country. It does flot provide for the fair treatment of
Our people.
Honourable senators, this could bc a good agreement. ht
could be accompanied by adequate supporting measures. It
could bc conducive to the development of our country as a
sovereign and united country. It could provide for the fair
treatrnent of Canadians, but it does none of these things.
Given the resuits of the recent election, it would flot be
proper for me to vote against the bill. As 1 cannet, in conscience, support it, 1 will abstain from the vote. As the bill is
likely to pass, 1 join Senator Bell and others who pledge
themselves to try to make it work in the event that it becomes
law.
Hon. Lowell Murray (Leader of the Government, Minister
of State for Federal-Provincial Relations and Acting Minister
of Communications): Honourable senators, if 1 may, 1 should
like to make a few comments on tbe recommendations we have
heard from the committee today and on some of the statements we have heard frorn honourable senators in the course of
the debate on tbird reading of thîs bill.
1 should first like to deal with two points raised by Senator
Stollery in bis speech. Senator Stollery referred to the testimony given to the committee yesterday by Mr. Mel Clark. Mr.
Clark made a number of statements ini the course of bis
testimony which the governrnent believes to bc quite inaccurate and which it was in a position to refute through evidence
of our officiais who were prescrnt but who, because of the
pressures of time, did flot have an opportunity ta reply directly
to Mr. Clark's testirnony.
Shortly after the meeting of yesterday one of the senior
officiaIs prescrnt, Mr. Alan Nymark of the Trade Negotiations
Office, wrote to the chairman of the committee, Senator
Stewart, a two and a haîf page letterHon. John B. Stewart: 1 have not received any such letter.
Senator Murray: 1 arn sorry that that is the case, honourable senators, and, indeedSenator Stewart: It is absolutely new to me that there is
such a letter. I do not know what the bonourable senator is
talking about. That letter neyer came to me; nor did it corne to
the committee.
Senator Perrault: Shocking!
Senator Murray: 1 arn very sorry that that is the case.
Senator Stewart: Don't use it, then.
Senator Murray: Oh, 1 beg your pardon, but I intend to use
't.

Senator Stewart: You may wish to do so, but that is flot a
committee document, 1 can assure you.
Senator Murray: The honourable senator should flot get s0
exercised over what can only have been a difficulty in getting a
letter to bim.
Senator Perrault: It was sent by Canada Post, was it?

SENATE DEBATES

Senator Murray: The honourable senator is getting quite
unduiy exercised. 1 arn telling him that a letter, which was
signed by a senior officiai of the government, was addressed to
him.
Senator Stewart: it was flot received.
Senator Murray: Right, it was flot received.
Senator Stewart: Ai right.
Senator Murray: Fine; Jet us have that on the record: It was
flot received. i arn now assisting the Senate bySenator Stollery: You received it!
Senator Murray: Yes, i have a copy of it.
Senator Stewart: Why don't you read from your private
diary?
Senator Murray: Why is the honourable senator so afraid to
hear what is in this document?
Senator Stewart: This material neyer came before the
committee.
Senator Murray: Then let me place it before the Senate
now.
Senator Stewart: In that case, why don't you read from your
diary? It is of equal authority.
Senator Murray: Honourable senators, the letter was sent to
my friendHon. Royce Frith (Deputy Leader of the Opposition): It
was addressed to Senator Stewart; it was not sent. That is the
problem.
Senator Murray: How does the Deputy Leader of the
Opposition know that this letter was flot sent?
Senator Frith: Perhaps we can adjourn the debate on this
question.
Senator Murray: It was not received, but a copy of it was
sentHon. Allan J. MacEachen (Leader of the Opposition): We
do not think this letter ought to be put on the record until it
has been delivered to the chairman of the committee.
Senator Murray: Now we have the Leader of the Opposition
getting exercised about this.
Senator Frith: This is an inappropriate way to deai with the
letter; that is ail.
Senator MacEachen: Perhaps we should send the letter back
to the committee so that it can be deait with there.
eI1420)
Senator Murray: The Leader of the Opposition is getting
very exercised now.
Senator Stewart: i should like ta ask the Leader of the
Government a question. Is he introducing a new rule on the
basis of which 1, as chairman of the committee, could rise here
and say, "Evidently. a letter has been written to me as
I cnnir

chairman of the committee. i didn't put it before the committee. i might have received 50 such ietters. They were neyer
received by the committee and they have no standing in
reference ta the work of the committee."?
Senator Murray: Honourable senators. forget that i ever
mentioned the letter. Let me deai with the points. Let me only
deal with the points.
Senator Stewart: Yes, kiii the man, and then say. -Let's
forget that i did so!"
Senator Murray: 1 have flot killed you yet! Wait! i have not
even killed your arguments yet!
Senator Stewart: You have put the assertion on the record,
now you say, "Forget it!"
Senator Guay: When did you receive this letter?
Senator Murray: 1 received it today. at noon.
Honourable senators, let me simply deal, on behaîf of the
goverfiment. wîth some of the evidence that was placed before
the committee yesterday by Mr. Mel Clark. In particular. 1
should like to deal with his statementSenator Thériault: Honourable senators, i have a point of
order. This is very important for this Parliament. 1 would wish
and hope that the Leader of the Government in the Senate
would withdraw the remarks he made when he quoted from a
letter supposedly sent ta a chairman of a committee that was
neyer received. If anything, he should at least withdraw that,
and then quote from the information that he received.
Senator Murray: Honourabie senators, there is nothing ta
withdraw. My statement is that a letter has been addressed ta
the chairman. i arn sorry that the chairman has flot received it.
1 have no doubt that he will receive it in due course.
Meanwhile, on the basis of my speaking notes, may i be
permitted to dca! in a very unemnotional way, 1 hope. with one
of the arguments that was placed before the committee by Mr.
Mel Clark yesterday? This is the argument that our friend
Senator Stollery made his own in the course of his speech in
debate on third reading this afternoon.
Senator Stollery pointed out-or repeated. rather-Mr.
Clark's ailegation that since 1949 the GATT had refused ta
intervene in settling disputes arising under a bilateral agreement, and thus. according to Mr. Me! Clark and Senator
Stoilery, the option in Article 180i(2) ta take a case ta the
GATT is meaningless. This assertion by Mr. Me] Clark and
Senator Stoliery is wrong. i arn informed that in the 1949
Margins Preference case the GATT stated that it would not
rule on the determination of rights and obligations between
governments arising from a bilateral agreement where the
matter was flot within the competence of the contracting
parties ta the GATT. However, where either party ta a
biiaterai agreement may aiso be in violation of its GATT
obligation. the GATT has jurisdiction. To give an example,
Canada could not seek a GATT pane! to adjudicate a dispute
arising from chapter 14 of the FTA, which deais with services,
because these are obligations arising from the Free Trade
Agreement, flot from the GATT. But in the area of antidump-

December 30, 1988

DEBATES
Decemer30,1988SENATE

ing and countervail. where there are existing GATT obligations, Canada could proceed either to GATT or to the FTA
dispute-settlement mechanism.
Senator Stollery: Honourable senators, 1 would like bo have
one moment to explain tbat flot onlySenator Doody: You spoke in this debate earlier.
Senator Stollery: You have mentioned my observation, and
you have, on the basis of a spurious letter, introduced spurious
evidence and ignored the fact that we were told that in 40
years neyer bas the procedure been used that you were saying
can be used. So 1 do flot sec the point of your uninformed
comment.
Senator Murray: My honourable friend will have an opportunity to read the statements tbat 1 have made when he gets
bis copy of Hansard, or, îndeed, bis copy of tbis letter. But tbe
point that 1 bave just made, tbat Canada would bave an option
eitber to invoke the dispute-settlement mechanism of tbe Free
Trade Agreement or to go to tbe GATT in an area in wbicb
tbere are existing GATT obligations, effectively refutes the
point that Mr. Me] Clark made at the committee yesterday
and wbicb the bonourable senator has made bis own in the
debate on tbird reading today.
There are a number of otber matters in Mr. Clark's testimony that 1 should deal witb immediately.
Article 104 of the Free Trade Agreement affirms tbe existing rights and obligations of the parties to one anotber. This
includes GATT rights whicb are flot removed in tbe antidumping and countervail area by virtue of Article 1801(l). This
article merely indicates tbat for the matters specifically covered by chapter 19, including binational panel dispute settlement in antidumping and countervailing duty cases to replace
review of final determinations by a domestic court, chapter 18
shaîl flot apply. Neither cbapter 18 nor chapter 19 provide tbat
for matters covered by chapter 19 the parties' GATT rigbts no
longer apply.
If Canada believes tbat a U.S. antidumping or countervailing duty law or tbe application of sucb a law is inconsistent
witb UJ.S. obligations under tbe GATT, Canada remains free
to raise its case in the GATT. i also bas the option, under
Article 1801(2). of raising the matter bilaterally with the
Canada-U.S. Trade Commission. The fact that Canada may
subsequently wisb to avail itself of binational panel review of
the final decision rendered in the U.S. in tbat case in no way
prejudices our rigbts under chapter 18 of the FTA. Tbus it is
incorrect to state, as Mr. Clark did, that the FTA replaces
GATT rules witb the rule of U.S. law.
Mr. Clark also referred to Canada being worse off under tbe
FTA than previously, because section 409 of the U.S. impIementing legislation allegedly introduces new counitervail remedies wbich apply only to Canada. Tbis also is flot correct. Tbe
U.S. statement of administrative action makes it clear that
section 409 does not create any new trade remedies. Furthermore, it does flot obviate tbe need to comply fully with tbe
criteria and procedures of existing U.S. trade law nor does it
prejudge any investigation or determination under those laws.

Honourable senators, the second matter tbat Senator Stollery dealt witb in bis remarks on third reading todaySenator Stewart: Before Senator Murray continues, I sbould
like to rise on a point of privilege, botb a point of personal
privilege and as a member of the committee.
Senator Murray bas alleged that a letter was written to me
as cbairman of the committee. 1 assert that I receîved no sucb
letter and that no sucb letter was in tbe possession of tbe
committee wben it concluded its unanimous report. My point
of privilege is tbat tbere was an implication that 1.as cbairman
of the committee, bad certain knowledge, indeed. tbat tbe
committee bad certain knowledge wbicb is flot reflected in the
report it made to tbe Senate earlier this day.
1 bave no objection to the Leader of the Government making
statements on bebaîf of the government, but wbat I do object
to most earnestly, bonourable senators, is tbat that information
sbould be smuggled before this flouse in tbe guise of a letter
wbicb was not received by me, cither personally or as chairman of the committee, in wbicb capacity I serve this body.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, bear!
Senator Murray: Honourable senators, 1 accept the statement of tbe bonourable senator. What can I do except regret it
if, for some reason, he bas not received the letter? Let me tell
bim wbat my information is.
Senator Frith: Don't use it, that is what you can do.
Senator Murray: My information isSenator Stewart: Honourable senators, tbe Leader of tbe
Government does not really get the pitb and substance of my
objection. I am accusing bim of smuggling!
Senator Murray: Honourable senators, tbis is silly, this is
truly silly.
Senator Stewart: That shows your sense of values.
Senator Murray: Tbis is truly silly. 1 bave placed on the
record, on my own responsibility as a member of tbe governmentSenator Stewart: But you did not do that.
Senator Murray: -a refutation of certain testimony tbat
was given to tbe committee yesterday by Mr. Mel Clark.
Senator Perrault: Wben did you receive your letter?

a

(14301

Senator Murray: I bave donc so, as I said, on my own
responsibility as a member of the government.
I began to say, until, to my astonisbment, I was interrupted
by irate senators, that the same refutation was contained in a
letter wbicb bad been addressed by a senior officiaI of tbe
Trade Negotiations Office to the bonourable senator in bis
capacity as chairman of the committee. I cannot understand
bis indignation. He migbt be indignant witb the post office for
not baving delivered the letter, but let me tell bim wbat my
information is.

SENATE DEBATES
SENATE DEBATES
My information is that yesterday an officer of the Trade
Negotiations Office handed the letter in an envelope to my
friend, and that my friend handed itSenator Stewart: -. .. handed il"?
Senator Murray: Yes, handed the letter in an envelope 10
my friend, and my friend handed it to the clerk of the
committee. At the same time a copy of the letter was given by
the officer of the Trade Negotiations Office to the clerk of the
committee. lndeed, the letter that 1 have-and 1 mnust refer 10
it again-while it is addressed 10 the Honourable John Stewart, states: -c.c. Mr. Patrick Savoie, Clerk of the Standing
Senate Cornmittee on Foreign Affairs.Ail kinds of things can happen-the honourabie senator did
flot open the letter or il was rnisiaid somnewhere. Clearly, he
does not have the letter. Clearly. this was the first he had
heard of it.
Senator Stollery: ht is getting worse.
Senator Murray: Weli, 1 arn sorry about that, but why is he
so indignant that 1 shouid place the material on the record of
the Senate in the course of the third reading debate? ht is not
as if the materiai was so offensive or inflarnratory.
Senator Perrault: When was it on his desk?
Senator Stollery: hI has characterized the whole debate.
Senator Murray: It amounts to a refutation, on behaîf of the
government, of îestimony that was placed before the committee yesterday by a wiîness. 1 think it is the kind of information
that the house and the country is entitled to, and 1 therefore
place it on the record. Frankly, 1 find the interventions and
indignation of honourabie senators quite silly.
Senator Stewart: Honourable senators, 1 do not wish to
pursue the malter any further. The Leader of the Government
in the Senate says now that he wants to put this information
before the Senate on his own authorîîy. i do not objeci 10 his
proceeding in that way. 1 have raised my point of privilege.
The records of the house are clear. 1 can oniy conclude that
the Honourable Leader of the Government's perception of
parliamentary values is beyond improvement by anything 1
might say.
Senator Frith: Honourabie senators, i assume that the
questionsSenator Murray, are you finished?
Senator Murray: lndeed, 1 arn not finished. 1 sat down
beca use-

Senator Frith: Let us get it straight about the letter.
Senator Murray: 1 have not finished my speech.
Senator Frith: This concerns a point of order.
On the orderliness of proceeding with this letter at ail. 1
understand that the Leader of the Government in the Senate is
having difficulty understanding why there was such a sharp
reaction from the chairman and members of the committee to
his attempt to introduce, on third reading of the bill, a letter
addressed, but not delivered, to the chairman of the commitI Scn.nur M urran:]

tee, not considered by the committee, and not now available
for consideration by the committee. If we are to proceedSenator Stollery: Because we in fact have been reasonable.
Senator Frith: -as we have undertaken 10 proceedAn Hon. Senator: Neyer seen it!
Senator Frith: -there was no way for the committee to deal
with this. We reacted the way we did because we worked fairly
hard on this committee. We worked nine 10 ten hours a dayand that is aIl right. we undertook to do that, I arn not
complaining or looking for sympathy. It was an instructive and
interesting experience. However, the committee report was
based on the evidence before the committee. On the basis of
the evidence that was before us, as the report states, "On the
evidence presented 10 us," we worked, again. long hours to
prepare a report. We completed that report. passed it unanimously. and brought il before the Senate as a basis for the
third reading. That report was adopted. We felt that the
committee aspect of the matter had been deait with.
If, then, at third reading, some honourable senator wants 10
deal not with some criticism of the report but with the
evidence, there is nothing wrong with anyone talking about the
evidence that is there.
Senator Murray: But he may not refute it?
Senator Frith: No, that is flot the point. Certainly he can do
what you eventually tried to do. I arn sirnply trying 10 explain
why we were concerned. It is because we are now faced with
the evidence that we in the committee heard.
You did ask for an explanation. Do you want to hear il?
Senator Murray: i do flot think 1 did.
Senator Frith: Yes, you said, "I cannot understand.Senator Murray: That is flot an invitation for explanation.
Senator Frith: Oh, 1 see. Ail right.
Senator Perrault: They want to bask in ignorance.
Senator Frith: I now understand how closed your mind is to
it. but let me put it on the record-even if il is boring 10 you.
So, honourable senators, in any normai circumstances the
comrnittee would say at this stage: Since we cannot question
this document, as we did question the author of the document
when he was before usAn Hon. Senator: I have not seen it!
Senator Frith: -the only way that we can deal with this in
a normai fashion is 10 say that it is perfectly proper for the
leader 10 raise it. We must now consider moving that the bill
be flot now read a third time but that it be referred back t0 the

about it and be ready far it ta be delivered. The authar ai it
can came before the committee and make these points. We can
then deal with it and bring it back. If, again. someone says,
"But I have a letter here that refutes that," we can send it
back again. That is why it is unfair ta do that; that is ail.
Senator Guay: Right on!
Senator Frith: To have stood and said, "This is what I say
about some ai tbe evidence I read" is anc thing. But ta try ta
qualify a persan who was a witncss by saying wbat bis job was,
and then trying ta bootleg it in in this waySenator Guay: That is a good word.
Senator Frith: -caves open the questian-and I leave it ta
the leader and the chairman ta cansider tbis-whether or not
the only thing ta do is ta let the committee look at this letter.
Senator Guay: A goad baatlegging job!
Senator Perrault: Hear, hear!
Senator Murray: Honourable senators can indced reflect an
that. Since they have a majority in this place, they will decide
what they want ta decide.
Senator Frith: That is correct. Now you are right! Now you
are an the right track!
Senator Murray: H-onourable senators, 1 want ta deal witb
another matter that was raised by Senator Stollery.
Senator Frith: That is the reward for cooperatian.
Senator Guay: Did you get anather letter?
Senator Murray: I want ta deal now with the question ai the
temporary entry ai professionals and others that was raised in
comments by Senator Stollery.
The first thing that bas ta be said about this matter is that
those provisions relating ta temporary cntry are in the Frce
Trade Agreement because we Canadians asked that tbey be
put there. It is aur business cammunity in this country that is
applauding the provisions that arc there in that respect.
Honourable senators should know that because Canada bas
been a gaod deal more liberal over the years in this respect
than the United StatesSenator Guay: That is hurting your feelings.
Senator Murray: -we have ta make few legislative adjustments as a result ai the provisions in the Fre Trade Agreement rclating ta temporary entrySenator Stollery: Because it is by regulation, and the entire
section is being handled, we are tald, by regulation.
Senator Murray: -whereas the United States bas ta make
considerable adjustments in its legislation and regulations.
Senator Guay: A small price ta pay for its passage!
Senator Murray: I want ta put it ta the honourable senatar,
and ta others who are interested in tbis, that without these
provisions the gains that we have made in terms af trade in
services would be far less useful ta aur country witbout the
ability ai aur business people to go across the border, as

provided for in the Free Trade Agreement and the legisiation.
Without the ability of our business people to go across the
border as provided for in the Free Trade Agreement and in the
legisiatian. the gains that we have made with regard ta the
services industry would be far less useful to us.
Furtber to that, and as a long-standing issue in trade
between our twa cauntries, our manufacturers will be able ta
provide after-sales service ta their U.S. customers as a resuit of
these provisions. As 1 say, the provisions are reciprocal, but we
should not be concerned about that. Canada has historically
been mucb more liberal in its temparary entry palicies than
bas the United States, and there wilI be no great change for us.
Senator Stollery: Two years is temparary?
Senator Murray: Some concern was expressed about the
wide range of professionals wbo wiII bc permitted casier entry
under this chapter. Again, 1 sbould like ta point out that it was
important ta include as many professionals as possible. because
without the ability of arcbitects, engineers or management
consultants ta cross the border freely tbe benefits of open
access for the provision af services could not be achieved.
Fînally, with* regard ta professionals sucb as lawyers and
university teachers, wbile they are on the list for expedited
temporary entry, the rules on hiring or Iicensing in these
specific professions have not been touched by the Free Trade
Agreement. In other words, they are not covered by the
services chapter of the agreement. Thus wc can still institute
or retain "Canadians first" policies. if that is what we wish ta
do. If, at some future time, the gaverning authorities for these
professions choose ta allaw U.S. citizens equal apportunity in
Canada, their entry will be facilitated at the border. In the
meantime they wiIl at least have expedited entry for purposes
of researcb, consulting and so on. Therefare, in summary, the
temporary entry chapter is an important achievement for
Canada, which will prove itself tîme and again as business
people take advantage of the Free Trade Agreement.
Senator Basa: What about the European Economic
Cammunity?
Senatar Murray: Honourable senators, the report made by
the Foreign Affairs Committee today suggested thatSenator Stollery: Honourable senators, 1 risc on a point of
arder. 1 must say that 1 did not join in the previaus point af
order. Even thaugh the credibility af my remarks was thrown
inta same disrepute in a very spuriaus manner rather late in
the day, 1 especially chose not ta join in that protest because 1
wanted honaurable senators ta have the opportunity ta get
away fram Ottawa.
However, 1 must say that 1deplare this method ai bringing
up--at the Iast moment, when everyone bas reluctantly agreed
ta end this matter taday-argumentation whicb was not
brought up before the Standing Senate Committee on Foreign

look for inadequacies in those programs and in the application
of those programs. I arn sure tbat the programs are flot
perfect. I think the committee should invite workers, business
people and communities that are availing themseîves of these
programns to share wîth the committee their experience in
living with these programs.
The committee also seeks, and will receive with the adoption
of the report, a role in monitoring the negotiations an countervail and antidumping. Here again, as I indicated at second
reading, the government will cooperate with the committee in
this matter. However, as I bave also said, we draw the line, as
governments always have and always will, at divulging the
details of negotiations which could damage our position in
those negotiations. On those matters we have to be the judge
as to when and how much we can reveal consistent with the,
public interest.
In conclusion, I simply want to pay tribute ta ministers,
present and previous. who have been involved in the free trade
negotiatians and in the gavernment's free trade initiative. 1
think of the past ministers for International Trade, the Honourable James Kelleher and the Honourable Pat Carney, as
well as the present. the Honourable John Crosbie. On behaîf of
the government, certainly on behaîf of my colleagues in the
government party, I also, want to express our warm appreciation to Ambassador Reisman and to the many public servantsSoine Hon. Senators: Oh, oh!
Senator Stollery: You have already expressed your
appreciation to him with a million bucks!
Senator Doody: Order!
Senator Murray- 1 arn terribly sorry that honourable senators cannot find it in their bearts, at this season of the year in

Senator Murray: -for bis exceptional dedication ta
Canada, for his exceptional dedication ta duty, and for the
tremendous energy, enthusiasm and skilî he brought ta bis
task. I express tbat appreciation not only to Ambassador
Reisman but ta the many public servants in the Departmnent of
External Affairs and the Trade Negotiations Office who have
taken part in this initiative over these many months.
Last, but not least of course, a word for tbe Right Honourable the Prime Minister. whose vision, skill, determination and
political leadership have seen this initiative througb ta a
successful conclusion.
Somne Hon. Senators: Hear, hear!
Senator Murray: Previous generations of political leaders,
going back before Confederation, have grappled with the
problems and opportunities of our econornic and our trading
relationship with the United States. As honourable senators
know, elections were fougbt on this issue in the early days of
Confederation and, indeed, in this century in the election of
1911, wben the Laurier goverfiment was defeated on a free
trade initiative that it had taken witb the United States. We

have been told that Prime Ministers King and St. Laurent had
corne close to concluding free trade agreemnents witb tbe
United States, but drew back. My own party. as honourable
senators know, through rnuch of its early history, opposed fre
trade with the United States. We oppased it because in aur
judgrnent Canada was flot ready, was flot ready politically.
economically or culturally. for free trade with the Ujnited
States.
Honourable senators. Canada is ready today. Tbis government bas negotiated a Free Trade Agreemnent witb the United
States, and the policy of the goverinent in this matter bas
widespread support arnong the provinces, in the business community, and I think it is clear outside of Parliarnent that it bas
widespread support among members of various political parties. That the agreement bas this support in the country
speaks, I believe, of a new confidence among Canadians, a new
confidence in our own political independence. in our cultural
identity and in our economic potential. AIl that we cherisb
about Canada. and aIl that makes us unique as a country, will
bc enbanced as Canadians excel and prosper under the Free
Trade Agreemnent with the United States. Once again, 1
cornmend the agreement and this bill ta the support of the
Senate at tbird reading.
Sonie Hon. Senators: Hear, bear!
Hon. Allan J. MacEachen (Leader of the Opposition):
Honaurable senators, 1 ar n ot sure that I can begin or end my
comments with the elevated prose used by tbe Leader of the
Government as lie attempted. once more, ta purnp some substance inta the Free Trade Agreement debate, substance which
the government bas been unable ta explain and wbicb is flot
dîscerned by the Canadian people at large. Despite wbat the
Leader of the Governrnent bas said, and despite the outcorne
of tbe electian. the fact still remains that tbere is deep anxiety
and deep uncertainty in the country about the effect of the
Free Trade Agreement upon the Canadian econamy, upon
Canadian society and, in particular, upan aur political sovereignty. It would be nice if able craftsmansbip of parliarnentary
speeches could settle these matters, but it cannet. We beard
pîenty about it in tbe carnmittee.
We welcamed Senator Murray's presence in the cammittee
during the testimony of Mr. de Grandpré an tbe question of
adjustment. He was flot there, however, wben we beard from
the representatives of the Canadian Labour Cangress. I do flot
complain about tbat, but about the fact that the representative
of the Canadian Labour Congress-having been a determined
opponent of the Free Trade Agreemnent, baving jained witb the
Pro-Canada Network ta oppose the agreemnent, baving now
accepted the results of the election-came to tbe carnmittee ta
describe ta us bis apprebiensions about the impact of the Free
Trade Agreemnent. He talked about the dire consequences
accruing ta Canadian industry and jobs as a result of the
low-wage campetition frorn the southern United States. I
asked bim about nortbern workers in the United States, and he
cited the instance of wbat be described as the "rust belt". He
said that the mavernent of industry and jobs in the United

SENATE DEBATES
SENATE DEBATES
States had occurred because the northern states and the
northern communities had been unable to meet the competition that Canadian firms will now have to face with low-wage
competitors in the southern United States. That was his fear,
and to attempt to remove it by references to noble sentiments
of aspiration is a mistake.
Honourable senators, I am not ready to refight the election.
I said that in my speech on December 27. Today is December
30, but it seems like a long time has passed since Tuesday,
because we have been in the committee room almost continuously since then. In my statement on Tuesday I said that I
was prepared to look forward, to prepare for the implementation of the Free Trade Agreement, and that we should hold to
account those who have brought it about and, particularly, to
insist that they deliver the benefits which even today we are
told will certainly flow from the agreement. We intend and we
think we ought to look forward and hold those people accountable and insist that they deliver.
I must say that I regret that Senator Murray, this afternoon, made a mistake in attempting to bring before the
Senate, in a surreptitious way in my view, a letter which had
been written by a government official and which never reached
the committee and was therefore never examined by the
committee. It was a mistake, because it disturbed the cooperative mood that had prevailed in the committee since the

moment it received the order of reference.
Honourable senators, I want to express my admiration to
the chairman, Senator Stewart, for his work and to all members for their diligence.
We heard from officials of the government, who helped us
considerably in clarifying certain aspects of the Free Trade
Agreement, as well as from a limited number of witnesses who
were not government officiais but who are experienced and
possess considerable credentials. Some were against the agreement and some were for the agreement, but, overall, I believe
they did give us a balanced preview of what may lie ahead.
I am pleased that Senator Murray again emphasized the
question of adjustment in his address, because it will be a
continuing priority and, from his comments, presumably the
government will give it a high priority. That is to be welcomed.
Honourable senators, I heard some disquieting comments in
committee, for example, from the chairman of the Economic
Council of Canada, Ms. Judith Maxwell, who told us that
when jobs are lost in the coming years we shall not be able to
identify the cause of the lay-off-that is, to identify whether a
job is lost because of the Free Trade Agreement. That view
was shared by Mr. de Grandpré, the chairman of the Task
Force on Adjustment Assistance. If it is true that it is impossible for the chairman of the Economic Council of Canada to
identify the costs of the Free Trade Agreement, then it must
also be acknowledged that the estimates which have been given
by the same council alleging job creation as a result of the
agreement lack credibility at this stage. I put it to Mr. de
Grandpré that if we were told the difficulties were too great to
measure the job losses flowing from free trade then surely the
Senitor \iachacihendj

December 30,.1988
December 30. 1988

benefits could not be measured either. I asked him if that was
right, and his answer was, "You are absolutely right."
What we must now remind the government and the chairman of the Economic Council of Canada to do is to stop
talking about so-called "job creation" if they cannot tell us
about the job losses. The analytical difficulties are enormous,
apparently, when it cornes to telling us about the jobs that will
be lost, but are easily managed in terms of job creation. I
found that portion of the evidence very disquieting.
I hope the supporters of the agreement have not agreed that
the benefits are to be highlighted and the losses obscured or
concealed.
The chairman of the Economic Council of Canada also
seemed to proclaim the futility of government programs. When
she was pressed as to whether anything ought to be done for
firms in communities affected by free trade. the answer was,
"....

firms use government funds to finance investment that

they would have done on their own." That certainly was a
pretty drastic condemnation of the types of programs that are
now in place, as referred to yesterday in the committee and
today in the Senate by the Leader of the Government in the
Senate. I do not share that view. I do not support that view of
the chairman of the Economic Council of Canada, because I
do believe that appropriate assistance to firms by the government can be decisive in maintaining and encouraging employment in certain communities of Canada. I think we shall be
returning to adjustment. It was clear that we did not get ail
the answers yesterday. We know that Mr. de Grandpré has
made public no specific proposais yet. He will do so in March,
but up to the present there is nothing that we can hold up in
the Senate today and say, "This is a solution to possible
readjustment from the Free Trade Agreement."
g

(1510)

I should like to refer to another aspect of the discussions,
and that is the enormous amount of work and preparation that
has to be undertaken for the extensive negotiations that will
take place with the United States. A great deal of work
remains to be done, and it was interesting that one of the
witnesses knowledgeable in the field told us that the harassment to which Canadian firms have been subjected over the
years will continue, although this was a stated reason for the
entry into negotiations with the United States. There is nothing in this agreement that would limit the harassment of
Canadian firms by American importers, harassment that has
arisen from trade remedy laws.
Senator Frith: And their new Omnibus Trade Bill makes it
easier.
Senator MacEachen: In the face of negotiations down the
road on subsidies, it was disquieting to hear one of the
witnesses say that it was unlikely that the bilateral negotiations on subsidies between Canada and the United States
would make any progress until after the completion of the
GATT round, which he expected would take place at Easter
time in 1992. That is an important question.
Senator Frith: And he was a supporter of the agreement!

December 30. 1988

SENATE DEBATES
EAE
SNT

Senator MacEnchen: 1 have heard it stated in government
circles that nothing of importance can happen in the negotiations on subsidies with the United States until we know what
wîll happen on subsidies in the GATT round. That means that
the resolution of concerns about U.S. trade remedy laws that
might occur through these negotiations will be delayed considerably into the future. perhaps even for several years.
1 must say that 1 sympathize to some extent with Senator
Murray in trying to put additional evidence on the record this
afternoon. He referred to the evidence of Mr. Mel Clark. We
heard his evidence, although his views had been made public
weeks ago. Mr. Clark's argument, to which Senator Murray
took exception today, was uttered before the committee, and
we certainly attempted, in the time available within the comnmince, to resolve that argument. Senator Bazin and Senator
Frith, who are both lawyers, joined the discussion, as did Mr.
Peter Clark, in an effort flot to obscure the point but to sec if
we could reach a clarification of the relationship between the
dispute-settlement provision with respect to antidumping and
countervail in the Free Trade Agreement and the dispute-settlement system of the GATT. We did not reach a conclusion,
and 1 think, honourable senators, this underlines the difficulties that we faced in trying to probe each of these items in the
very short time available. It was certainly not lack of interest
or lack of good will on the part of the committee that made it
necessary for the Trade Negotiations Office to attempt to send
a letter to the chairman of the committee. We should have had
ail of that evidence before our committee so that we could
have made some finding on that point. But this was impossible,
and, presumably, when we go into the next phase of the
committee .work we shall have to return to that subject.
Our work was force fed, honourable senators, and 1 believe
that it would be better for aIl of us, and for the country, if we
had a lot more time to understand the actual provisions of this
agreement rather than having to deal so much with the
rhetoric-on both sides. Senator Murray concluded on a high
rhetorical note today, adding nothing to the analytical understanding of the provisions of the bill, but building up a
rhetorical momentum that might be serviceable in selling the
Free Trade Agreement, even though it is flot understood. He
took the occasion to again try to clear up the mess that had
been created in the committee by the evidence we heard on the
temporary entry provisions.
Senator Frith: It is terrible!
Senator MacEachen: We are now in another difficulty here.
I believe that in his speech Senator Murray directly contradicted testimony which we heard in the committee. 1 do flot
have that testimony available because it has flot yet been
printed.
The majority of members of the committee notes in the
report as foliows:
with respect to the provisions for the temporary entry of
business persons, the evidence presented to the Committee
created confusionfi sure did.

Senator Frith: That is the nicest thing you could say about
't.

Senator MacEachen: That was the third draft, each draft
becoming less tart than the preceding one.
-the evidence presented to the Committee created confusion and cast doubt on the conceptual founidation and
adequacy of preparations for the promulgation of impiementing regulations;
Now. if what we heard was incorrect. and if what Senator
Murray said was correct, then we ought to have had ail of that
in the committee and settled it so that we are not left today
with a majority of the committee saying that the temporary
entry provisions seem to be badly conceived and haîf baked.
Senator Frith: And contradictory.
Senator MacEachen: And contradictory. In my opinion the
evidence is contradictory to what Senator Murray has said. So
1 have made two comments about the evidence, those same
points that have been mentioned by Senator Murray-namely.
the important evidence of Mr. Met Clark, who is flot an
amateur in the field. He is flot someone who came off the
street and said, "I have a couple of views to express." He is an
experienced former trade official whose views will at least have
to be listened to, and disagreed with if necessary, but because
of the time constraints we did not get that opportunity.
1 have deait with those two points because they have been
raised by Senator Murray. He has found it necessary to raise
themn because we did not have the time to get the evidence in
the committee, flot because we were not interested. We tried
hard. However, 1 want to congratulate Senator Murray on the
final part of his speech in which he welcomed and promised
cooperation by the goverfiment with the work of the committee. The committee now has a mandate from the Senate to
monitor the implementation of the Free Trade Agreement and
related trade developments.
( 1520)

1 draw to the attention of the Leader of the Government
that the committee expressed a view on two other points, and I
hope that the goverfiment will cooperate with respect to these
two particular points that the committee has stressed. We
point out that in the United States an annual report is called
for on the progress being made in the many negoti*ations that
will be commencing soon, including the results of the working
group charged with establishing a bilateral regime governing
antidumping and countervail duties. The U.S. will report to
Congress on these matters, and we are suggesting that the
Canadian government should report to the Canadian Parliament and the Canadian public annually. We think it would
help our work-, we think it would be useful; and 1 believe the
committee was unanimous in making that suggestion.
The second point is that the U.S. government has submitted
a report to Congress on Canadian compliance with the Free
Trade Agreement. Canada should have a report on American
compliance with the Free Trade Agreement, and we are asking
that such a report be provided by the Canadian government
early in the new year. 1 draw these points to the attention of

SENATE DEBATES
SENATE DEBATES
the minister because we want to look ahead, and flot refight
the election campaign, which we lost. We accept that reality.
and it is because of that reality that we will flot stand up and
vote against this bill.
Nothing that we have heard in the committee has removed
the concerns we have had. In fact, some of our concerns have
been increased as a resuit of what we heard in the committee.
Senator Perrault: Hear, hear!
Senator MacEachen: In the fmeld of energy. the doubts 1 had
were certainly reinforced by the testimony of the Honourable
Mitchell Sharp yesterday. My concerns have increased, but,
despite that, we acknowledge that the Government of Canada
has a majority in the House of Commons. It has sent us this
bill to have it approved by the Senate. We shahl not participate
in its approval, we shah flot support it. The government
members will do that job, but they will also take responsibility
in the future for whatever resuits accrue.
Senator Murray: Ghadly!

FRIDAY,

December 30,1988

(d)

with respect ta the provisions for the
temporary entry of business persons, the
evidence presented ta the Committee
created confusion a.nd cast doubt on the
conceptual foundation and adequacy of
proparations for the promulgation of
umplementing regulations;

(e)

with respeoct ta anti-dumping and

negotiations on subsidies will be

The Standing Sonate Committe. on Foreign
Affairs has the honour to present ita
FIRST REPORT
Your Committe., to which was referred Bill C-2,
An Act t. implement the Free Trade Agreement
between Canadla and the United States of Amerlos,
has, in obedience to the Order of Reference of
Tuesday, December 27, 1988, examined the said Bill
and reporta the sam..without amendment, but with
the following commentai and recommendations:
The Committe. decided to focus its attention on
five areas that it expecta will continue ta b. sources of
concern in the-future: adjustment assistance:
agriculture; energy; temporary entry provisions; and
the broad and important area of couritervail and antidumping.
From the testimony heard on these five
p articular areas, a majority of Members of the
Committee notes as follows:
(a) with respect ta adjustment assistance, no
new provisions have y et been proposed.
While witnesses agee that some regions,
industries and groupa will suifer by reason
of the Agreement, the y were virtually
unanimous that such difficulties could not
be deait with by specific rernedial
programs;
(b) with respect to agriculture, the Canadian
Federation of Agriculture and the
Canadian Egg Marketing Agency have not
been satisrled by the responses of the
Government;
(c) with respect ta energy, concerna relating to
thc security of Canadian supply, prornpted
by changes in the powers of he National
Eniergy Board and the proportionality
provisions of the Agreement, have flot been
