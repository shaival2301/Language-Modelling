SPEECH FHOM THE THRONE
His Excellency the Governor General was

thon pleasod to open tho First Session af the
Twenty-Fourth Parliament with tho following
Hanourablo Mombors of the Sonate,
Mmbers of the House oft Cemmans,
It is my pleasurp ta walcome you to this
First Session off te Twenty-Fourth Parliament of Canada. We ail recali with pleasure
tise historic ovonts off last autumn when Her
Graciaus Majosty was present to open parliament hrsemf and to receivt the warm welcorne and wide acclaimn of her Canadian
subjoct. W look forward to toe presonce this
summor of Her Royal Highnoss Princass
Margaret ta take part in thse contennial coremonios off Britishs Columbia and to visit athor
parts of Canada.
As furtisor evidonco off tise expanding sonse
of mutual interest among tse countrios of
Commonwealth as wetl as tse growth
of the Commonwealth itslf, it is plasing
withlasr
mycadl ier
antmel
n theCana
and significant that we will be wclcoming
to Canada this summor bath tne Prime Ministor oft te United Kingdom and the Prime
Minister of Ghana.
My ministoers have ben glad ta note tho
widely expressed desire of the peoples of
many nations that te manifnold advances of
dvoted to the bottormnt of
science shall bo
mankind rather than to the arts and engines
aofwar. My Government will continue ta
make unremitting efforts to assist in t e
poaceful sotution ne international problems
oan in thea accamplishment by patient negaand
substantial masure of disarmaciation of

MAY 12, 1958
ask your support to maintain, in co-operation
with our allies, armed forces adequate to
deter any potential aggression.
My Government believes that the condition
of international economic affairs is such as
to require major concerted efforts to encourage the expansion of trade. It is accordingly
very gratifying that all countries of the Commonwealth have accepted the proposal of
Canada that a Commonwealth Trade and
Economic Conference be held in September
of this year in Montreal.
We look forward with pleasure to the visits
to Canada this summer of the President of the
United States and the President of the Federal
Republic of Germany. My ministers welcome
the opportunities which these visits will afford
for useful conversations.
My Government regrets to have to report
that efforts to avert a strike of firemen on
the Canadian Pacific Railway were unsuccessful. It is however encouraging to note that
negotiations which my ministers arranged
between the parties have succeeded in narrowing the issues in dispute to the point
where further direct discussions may yet resolve the question. My Government continues
to maintain a constant watch over developments in this situation and will be ready in
the light of events to recommend such action
as the national interest demands and circumstances may require.
My Government will propose to you the
enactment of a Bill of Rights to safeguard
the rights of all persons in Canada in respect
of all subjects within the jurisdiction of
Parliament.
You will be asked to approve a number of
measures and appropriations to continue and
extend the program of my Government in
sustaining employment by the acceleration of
useful public works and by encouraging the
development and processing of our natural
resources.
You will be asked immediately to amend
the Unemployment Insurance Act in order to
extend for a further six weeks, during the
current year, the period during which special
seasonal benefits may be paid. Already the
amendments to this Act made in November
last and those made to the Unemployment
Assistance Act have proven their value in
mitigating the difficulties of Canadians who
are temporarily without jobs. Further amendments to the Unemployment Insurance Act
will be proposed at a later stage in the
session.
My Government will continue to promote
a vigorous program of house building, which
has already proven to be a strong feature of
our economy and which constitutes the best
opportunity for increased work in meeting
the needs of our people. My ministers are
57075-4-l

ready to co-operate fully under the authority
of the National Housing Act in further projects for slum clearance and urban redevelopment to improve the cities and towns
of Canada.
In order to ensure the continuation of our
national housing program, you will be asked
at an early date to approve an increase in
the public funds made available under the
National Housing Act.
You will be asked to make provision for
a substantial program of public investment
to be carried out by Government departments and Crown companies and to provide
assistance to provincial Governments for certain agreed types of projects. In particular, a
large expansion in the construction and
equipment of our system of airports and airways will be proposed and an increase in
our work on harbours and rivers and public
buildings.
In order to promote our national development on the frontier in the north you will
be asked to authorize the construction of a
railway to Great Slave Lake. My ministers
regard this as a major step in the establishment of productive industry on an economic
basis in the Northwest Territories. You will
also be asked to provide for the construction
of important roads needed for development
in the Yukon and Northwest Territories and
in the provinces, with the co-operation of
their Governments. You will be asked to
provide for the initiation of a program of
research to assist in opening up the mineral
resources of our Arctic islands.
My ministers have made progress in arrangements for the construction of the South
Saskatchewan project.
Proposals will be
placed before you to make possible the commencement, this year, of the construction of
the main dam intended to create a great
reservoir in the heart of the prairie in order
to further the productive development of this
part of Canada.
The easing of the stringency in the capital
markets of Canada during the past eight
months encourages confidence in the expectation that large programs of public investment
can be successfully financed not only by my
Government and its agencies but also by
provincial Governments and municipalities.
My ministers remain mindful of the importance of financing their large program of
expenditures in such manner as will best
safeguard against a recurrence of inflationary
dangers in future. They wish to urge upon all
groups in our society a recognition of the
dangers and inequities of inflation and the
need to restrain demands which will give
rise to increases in prices and the costs of
production.

SENATE
The improvements in our financial relations
with the provinces made by the last Parliament are having a beneficial effect upon our
economy by making it possible for provincial
Governments and their municipalities to proceed with greater confidence upon expanded
programs of necessary services and works.
There will be placed before you a proposal
to establish a new agency to regulate broadcasting in Canada and to ensure that the
Canadian Broadcasting Corporation and the
privately owned broadcasting stations work
effectively together to constitute a national
system to provide satisfactory television and
radio services to all Canadians within reach.
Related amendments to the Radio Act will
also be proposed.
To promote and guide the proper long-term
development of our National Capital region
upon lines worthy of our nation, my Government will request you to enact a new National
Capital Act to replace the present Federal
District Commission Act.
Changes will be proposed in the Hospital
Insurance and Diagnostic Services Act to
make certain that payments may be made
to participating provinces qualifying under
the act in respect of any periods commencing
after June this year.
You will be asked to authorize the
establishment of a Harbour Commission to
combine the growing harbours at Fort
William and Port Arthur and to fit this
Lakehead harbour to handle the larger traffic
to be expected as a result of the seaway.
Unremitting efforts are being made to sell
Canadian agricultural and fisheries products
in the markets of the world and considerably
larger exports of wheat and cattle have been
made. Support prices have now been established for a considerable number of products
under the Agricultural Stabilization Act to
carry into effect, for the current year, the
desire of Parliament that agriculture should
be thus assisted to realize fair returns for
its labour and investment.
The act to provide cash advances on farm
stored grain has proven to be of advantage to
a large number of farmers and to the economy
as a whole. Certain amendments will be
proposed to that act in the light of experience
in its application.
Amendments will also be proposed to the
Prairie Farm Assistance Act and the Canadian Farm Loan Act.
In order to assist small business, there will
be established a Small Business Section
within the administrative machinery of

government. The functions of this organization will be to provide liaison between the
Government and small businesses, to study
the problems of small business and to advise
on measures necessary to meet them.
You will be asked to replace the present
Ticket of Leave Act with a new statute to
establish a National Parole Board. There will
be submitted for your consideration amendments to the Citizenship Act and the Indian
Act to eliminate certain discriminatory provisions in these statutes.
Amendments will be proposed to the
Veterans Insurance Act, the Returned Soldiers
Insurance Act, the Children of War Dead
(Education Assistance) Act, the Emergency
Gold Mining Assistance Act, the Transport
Act, the National Parks Act and a number of
other statutes.
Members of the House of Commons,
You will be asked to appropriate the funds
required to carry on the services and payments
approved by Parliament.
My ministers will lay before you in accordance with the law the special warrants which
I issued upon their advice to authorize expenditures urgently required for the public
good during the period since the TwentyThird Parliament was dissolved. You will
be invited to consider and approve these
expenditures. An amendment to the Financial Administration Act will be proposed
relating to the use of special warrants.
Other measures will be proposed to improve
of
of the processes
the effectiveness
Parliament.
The Government will ask your approval of
the installation in the House of Commons of a
system of simultaneous translation.
You will be asked to set up a Select Committee on Broadcasting, a Standing Committee
on Estimates and Standing Committee on Veterans Affairs, all with power to send for
persons and papers. My ministers will propose that a member of Her Majesty's Loyal
Opposition be elected Chairman of the Committee on Public Accounts.
Honourable Members of the Senate,
Members of the House of Commons,
May Divine Providence bless and guide you
in the accomplishment of the high purpose
which brings you here.

The House of Commons withdrew.
His Excellency the Governor General was
pleased to retire.

THE LATE SENATOR MacKINNON
TRIBUTES

Hon. W. M. Aselline: Honourable senators,

my first duty before we transact any business
is a sad one. Since dissolution last January
another of our prominent senators has passed
to the Great Beyond; and one of the reasons
we are gathered here today is to pay tribute
to his memory. The occasion is a sad one for
me, and, I am sure, for all of us; and these
occasions occur all too frequently.
Honourable senators know that I became a
member of this chamber away back in
December of 1933: my first session was 1934.
If I remember correctly, when I came into
this chamber my seniority number was 90,
and now I find that it is 6. Since that time
some 84 or 85 honourable friends who were
here then, as well as quite a number of others
who were summoned here since, have passed
away. Obviously, life is a very fleeting thing.
At this time I regret to report the passing
of Senator James Angus MacKinnon, affectionately known in this chamber as Jim
MacKinnon. I knew all about Jim MacKinnon
before he entered politics. He was born in
a place called Port Elgin, in western Ontario.
In my town in Saskatchewan there was a
man who at one time had lived in Port
Elgin, where he and Jim MacKinnon had
played together as boys. This man used to
visit his old friend at Edmonton quite frequently, and when he came back he always
had a talk with me-we lived on opposite
corners of the same street-and he would tell
me that his friend intended to enter politics
a little later on, but in the meantime was
getting himself established in business. From
what he told me I was quite sure that if
Jim MacKinnon ever entered politics he
would be a success, for he was already a
successful business man. However, be did
not stand for election until the year 1935,
when he was elected for a city of Edmonton
seat by quite a large majority. As his friend
had prophesied, he became quite prominent
in the House of Commons; in fact, in 1940
he was named Minister of Trade and Commerce, a very important position indeed,
which he held until 1948. During that time
he travelled through the South Americas and
in many parts of the world, on behalf of the

Government of the day. Early in 1948 he
became Minister of Fisheries, but did not hold
that portfolio for very long, having been
appointed Minister of Mines and Resources
in the summer of that year. He remained
in that office until May 1949, when he was
summoned to and became a member of this
chamber.
Senator MacKinnon was a very kindly
man, one of nature's gentlemen. I always
considered him a very personal friend and
valued his friendship very highly. His presence here will be greatly missed, and I am
sure that you will all join with me in extending our sincere regrets to his daughter and
grandchildren.
Hon. W. Ross Macdonald: Honourable
senators, I join with the Leader of the
Government (Hon. Mr. Aseltine) in expressing my very deep sympathy to Senator MacKinnon's daughter and his three grandchildren. As we know they were very dear
to him, and they will miss him greatly. We
also will greatly miss Senator MacKinnon,
to whom the Leader of the Government has
referred in the manner in which we all
referred to him, as Jim.
Our late colleague was a Canadian, having
been born at Port Elgin, Ontario, of Scottish
parents. Both his father and his mother had
come from Scotland and settled in Canada,
and ho lived in that section of Ontario where
there were so many Scots.
He saw the vision which Sir Wilfrid Laurier
had seen at the beginning of this century,
namely, that the twentieth century belongs
to Canada; and, seeing that vision at an
early age, he went West and settled in
Alberta, where he became a prominent citizen and a successful businessman. He has
been in Parliament since 1935. That was
the year when I entered Parliament, and I
have been very close to him throughout the
intervening years.
Honourable senators may recall that in
1935 he was the only member elected to
I
the House of Commons from Alberta.
believe I am correct in that. He therefore
had the responsibility of representing all the
people of Alberta as a member supporting
the Government of the day, and I remember
well the stacks of mail he received. I would
go in his office, and every day hundreds of
letters would come to him from all over
Alberta. He never neglected one of those
letters. He was indeed a most faithful member
of Parliament.
He was called to the cabinet by the late
Right Honourable W. L. Mackenzie King, in
1939, as a minister without portfolio, and
in the following year became Minister of

MAY 13, 1958
Trade and Commerce. It was in that portfolio,
honourable senators, that he gave, I believe,
his most splendid service to our country. He
went on a trade mission to South America. I
have spoken to many representatives of South
American countries who met Jim MacKinnon
when he was on that mission, and I can say
he was indeed an ambassador of good will.
He built up a splendid feeling between Canada
and the South American countries. Later on,
as the honourable leader has said, Senator
MacKinnon held other portfolios in the Government.
Honourable senators, our late colleague was
widely known not only in Canada, but
throughout the United States. In fact, he was
so well known there that after his death an
article about him was given quite a prominent
place in the New York Times. I would like
to read what that newspaper said in its
issue of April 19 last. After announcing his
passing, the article went on:
He was president of James A. MacKinnon Company Limited, of Edmonton, and a director of
International Business Machines Company, Ltd., the
Canadian Montana Pipe Line Company, Catelli Food
Products Company, Dairy Supplies, Ltd., Vulcan
Oils, Sisco Mines, Commonwealth International Corporation and the Leverage Fund of Canada.
Mr. MacKinnon entered the cabinet as a Minister
without portfolio in MacKenzie King's Government
in 1939, becoming Trade Minister a year later.
He became Fisheries Minister in 1948 and Mines
Minister later the same year. He retained the latter
portfolio when Louis St. Laurent succeeded Mr.
King as Prime Minister late in 1948.
He resigned as Mines Minister in March, 1949, and
was appointed to the Senate a month later, remaining in the cabinet as a Minister without portfolio
for another year.

Senator MacKinnon was indeed a very
kindly man and a great gentleman. He spoke
evil of no one. When something was done
of which he did not approve, he would express
his disappointment, but he had no bitterness
in his soul. I am sure we will all remember
our late colleague as a kindly gentleman, and
a great friend to all of us.
Hon. Jean-François Pouliot: Honourable
senators, our new colleagues will realize that
the most precious reward of a political life
when a member of Parliament comes to
Ottawa is to make friendships that are
enduring. Senator MacKinnon used to greet
his colleagues by saying "Good day, my
friend." I know one of our colleagues who
uses the same expression whenever I meet
him; and there is another gentleman, in the
House of Commons, who follows the same
practice and says, when he meets one of his
colleagues, "Bonjour, mon ami." Senator
MacKinnon, with his big heart, meant that
greeting, meant it sincerely; he gave the lie
to the well-known dictum that "The friend
of all is the friend of none." I knew him
quite intimately when he had his office across

from mine, on the fourth floor of the House
of Commons. I saw how hard he worked for
the people of Canada, and especially for the
people of his own province, and how popular
he was with all.
I am not to repeat what has been said
in the moving tributes paid to the memory
of a well-beloved colleague by the new Leader
of the Government (Hon. Mr. Aseltine) and
the Leader of the Opposition (Hon. Mr.
Macdonald), but may I quote one of the most
gracious obituaries that has ever been published of a deceased public man? It is entitled
"Senator MacKinnon's Vistas", and it was
published in the Ottawa Journal of April 19:
"Big Jim" from Bruce County loved the vistas
of his native land. He knew the West when it was
raw and, as a cabinet minister, shared in the
counsels of the Dominion in anxious times.
He was one of the forever young and when his
duties of statecraft and business had eased it was
his relaxation to travel about the world, learning
about new countries and different people.
His views were as wide as those of the foothills and the lakes and his death is mourned. There
remains the memory of a gentle, kindly man whose
grace was friendship.

It was particularly moving to listen to the
impressive tributes that were expressed by
the pastor of his church at Edmonton, who
came to Ottawa for the funeral.
To his daughter and his grandchildren I
offer my most sincere sympathy.
Hon. F. W. Gershaw: Honourable senators,
coming from Alberta, as I do, I want to say
that the people of Edmonton loved "Jim"
MacKinnon. A large number attended his
funeral, and many flowers were sent, each
petal representing someone's kind thought or
some kind deed.
From a humble home he rose high in the
service of his country, and he will be mourned
by many. He achieved great honour and, as
has been said, was prominent in many affairs.
His -passing shows
The glories of our blood and state
Are shadows, not substantial things;
There is no armour against Fate,
Death lays his icy hand on kings.

I join in the expression of our sincero
sympathy to his daughter.
(Translation):
Hon. Aristide Blais: Honourable senators,
it is a painful duty for any one of us to
speak of the sudden demise of a Senate colleague, but when that colleague was also a
friend of fifty years' standing who played
an important part in one's life, then the loss
is irreparable for it is felt throughout this
earthly life.
Fifty-seven years ago-it seems as yesterday-a tall and handsome young man of
nineteen, from one of the old Scottish
families of Port Elgin, Ontario, took the

SENATE
train to that part of the Northwest Territories which, in 1905, became the province
of Alberta. The slogan "Go west young
man" was then in every mouth. His only
baggage was a certificate from the institute
of higher commercial studies of Bruce
county, a fine family education and a wealth
of ancestral traditions going back almost
to the first Scottish clans. Thus equipped,
James Angus MacKinnon could face any
changes in climate and all the ups and
downs of fortune. He had the mettle necessary to meet all trials and was eager to get
down to work. Anxious net to waste any
time, he accepted upon his arrival a position
as teacher in Lacombe; later, I believe, he
became school inspector at Wetaskiwin, a
few miles from Edmonton. Those few years
devoted to education in a rural community,
where everything had to be done from
scratch, brought him in contact with all the
problems of life. He was fascinated, intoxicated by the varied resources of the soil,
the beautiful scenery, the endless plains, the
bountiful crops, the Indian reserves and
their problems, the hunting and fishing and
the healthy and bracing air of the Rockies
which increased his optimism and doubled
his energies.
In 1905 he was in Edmonton to attend the
celebrations held in honour of the inauguration by Sir Wilfrid Laurier and Lieutenant
Governor Bulya of the new province of
Alberta and its entry into Confederation. Such
festivities, a milestone in any man's life, might
well have inspired patriotism and filled the
hearts of men with ambition to develop our
beautiful country. James MacKinnon must
have been moved to the very depths of his
soul by the impressive demonstrations which
were held on this occasion in Alberta. Not
long ago, he had the great satisfaction of
attending the fiftieth anniversary of the
province which he had so greatly helped to
develop.
The population having increased and a
general hardware store being needed to help
construction, he founded Northern Hardware
Limited which, I believe, though it has
changed hands many times, is still in existence. In the meantime, he contributed to the
"Bulletin" under the direction of the Hon.
Frank Oliver, Minister of the Interior in Sir
Wilfrid Laurier's Government, took an interest in politics, founded the Young Liberals
Club and played an important part in all
social activities, in sports, in the Chamber of
Commerce and in real estate. Nothing escaped
him, his interests extended to all fields and
he tried to keep abreast of everything. In
1911 he had chosen his calling; he sold
Northern Hardware Limited and launched

definitely into insurance and finance. His
popularity increased constantly and he organized the first hockey club in Edmonton.
Wherever he went, he was noted for his
nobility of character, his infinite tactfulness,
his true courtesy and his exquisite politeness
which, with his many qualities of heart and
mind, caused him to be elected in 1935 as
member of Parliament for Edmonton West
and later to be appointed as Minister of Trade
and Commerce in 1940, as Minister of Fisheries in 1948 and as Minister of Mines and
Resources in June, 1948. The same qualities
accompanied him in his trade missions to
South America and to the states of South
Africa; they were the key to his great
popularity.
When I recall the different stages of his
career, I can only conclude that he fashioned
his own destiny, for he left nothing to chance;
everything was wisely thought out, mulled
over, planned methodically and carried out
with unswerving perseverance.
He had the keenest sense of duty and
would let nothing interfere with the accomplishment of his duty. But he was at his
best in the privacy of his own home, where,
away from the pressure of business, be was
really himself and the most devoted of friends.
He had the highest regard for friendship and
his loyalty to his friends had become proverbial. Were I to summarize his life, I
would say that it was a model of honesty
and sincerity and I would propose him as
an example of a life well filled.
In closing, may I extend to him, in the
silence of the Great Beyond, a final expression
of appreciation for the deep friendship with
which he honoured me and for the many
kindnesses and gifts which he lavished upon
me.

Hon.
Donald
Cameron:
Honourable
senators, as a fellow townsman of Senator
MacKinnon for nearly 20 years, I would be
remiss in my duties and in my respect and
affection for him did I not take this opportunity to join with others in expressing deep
regret at the passing of this distinguished
Canadian and great friend.
Senator MacKinnon was probably known to
me in a capacity different from that in
which he was known to many others. I knew
him first when I was a student at the
University of Alberta. He was a friend of all
students there, and in his own kindly and
unobtrusive way he was responsible for helping more than one Canadian student to carve
a niche in the annals of this country, particularly in the West.

MAY 13, 1958
Reference has been made to the qualities
of kindness, generosity and character of
Senator MacKinnon. Nothing that could be
said could exaggerate in any way the meaning of those qualities. In the community in
which he lived, he was certainly "Mr. Edmonton" to all who knew him. I think it was
rather typical of him that even in his passing
he portrayed to the end that quality of unobtrusiveness which was so much a characteristic of him. For a man who made the contribution that he did to the building of this
country, particularly the West, he had the
great gift of doing it in a sincere and determined but none the less quiet and self-effacing way.
Senator MacKinnon was an outstanding
Canadian and a fine citizen, and the world
is poorer for his passing. I like to think that
in one who represented Canada in so many
missions abroad it was fortunate that there
were represented in such a marked degree
so many of the fine qualities we like to
associate with the name "Canadian".

That the senators mentioned in the report of the
Committee of Selection as having been chosen to
serve on the Standing Committee on Divorce during the present session, be and they are hereby
appointed to form part of and constitute the said
committee to inquire into and report upon such
matters as may be referred to them from time to

Motion agreed to.

Hon. Arthur W. Roebuck: Honourable senators, in the first instance, I wish to announce
that the Committee on Divorce will meet
tomorrow morning for purposes of organization. If notices of the meeting have not
already been sent out, I believe they are on
the way.
I wish to thank those members who served
on the committee previously for offering their
services again. There is an old saying that
the best reward of work well done is more
work to do, and no doubt those good members
who served so faithfully in the past have
been recognized by the Selection Committee
putting their names on once again. I hope
they will give to this session's work the same
attention and devotion that they gave last
session.
More particularly, I wish to welcome the
two new members of the committee, the
honourable Senators Emerson and Thorvaldson. Perhaps they will find the work not so
onerous and disagreeable as some people
might think, for there is a spirit of good
fellowship among the members and a very
happy relationship exists; we all feel we are
contributing something to the conduct of the
Senate and the well-being of Parliament.
That is a satisfaction to us. We try to do the
very best work we can, and may I say to
my fellow senators that since I have been
chairman-and it is now a number of yearswe have not made a report to the Senate that
has not been unanimous.
Hon. Mr. Bruni: Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Not that we have endeavoured to keep everybody in line, or
anything of that kind, for we have not; it
has just happened that in every case we
have been unanimous in what we felt was
the right conclusion. I am also delighted to
be able to say that, at least since I have
been chairman-and I believe this applies

May I take this opportunity, although it
may be a little out of order, to say how

chairman of the Divorce Committee is now
the Leader of the Government in this house.
Hon. Mr. Aseline: I have had good training.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: We all appreciated the
work and the attitude of the honourable the
senior senator from Winnipeg (Hon. Mr.
Haig) when he led the house last session,
and regret that he has seen fit to relinquish
his duties in that regard. However, he having
done so, I think I can speak for every member of this house when I say that we are ail
delighted to see the honourable senator from
Rosetown (Hon. Mr. Aseltine) in that position of responsibility. The honourable gentleman was kind enough to come to my office
shortly after his appointment. I repeat the
assurance I gave him on that occasionand again I think I can speak for all my
colleagues-that, short of pulling punches in
debate, we would do ail we could-and that
is a good deal-to make his tenure of office
successful. We wish him success, and for
my part I have great pleasure in seeing him
here as leader.

Hon. Thomas Reid: Honourable senators,
before the Orders of the Day are proceeded

leader (Hon. Mr. Aseltine) a question which
has to do with the Gordon Commission report.
If my memory serves me rightly, for long
years reports of committees or commissions
have always been distributed to members of
Parliament-members of the House of Commons and of the Senate-before being given
to the public. However, for the past month
the Financial Post and other papers have
been publishing extracts from the report submitted by the Gordon Royal Commission to
the Government, which report has not yet
been made available to members of Parliament. My question to you, sir, is, when may
we expect to receive a copy of that report?
Hon. Mr. Aselline: I will inquire into that
immediately and let my honourable friend
have an answer at the next sitting.
BUSINESS OF THE SENATE
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Honourable senators,
before the bouse adjourns may I inquire as

Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Honourable senators, it

expect to receive for consideration an interim

The Senate met at 3 p.m., the Speaker

Prayers.
DIVORCE
PETITIONS

Hon. Arthur W. Roebuck: Honourable
senators, I have a pleasant duty to perform.
1 wish to present to the house 288 petitions
for divorce.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Did you say pleasant
or unpleasant?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: I said a pleasant duty.
Whether anybody questions it as beîng a
pleasant duty or not, I hope to be able to
present 40 more petitions at our sittings
next week. At this time I would like to
make a few general remarks.
The number of petitons actually filed is
318, of which 288 were presented to the
Senate this afternoon.
An additional 30
petitions are in process of preparation, and
by the time we sit again a further 10 will
likely be ready for presentation. When
Parliament opened on October 14, 1957, I
had the h'onour to present 291 petitions, and
in 20 of those cases notice of opposition had
been given by the respondent. To date this
session there are 31 such notices of opposition. It will be seen, therefore, that there is
a steady growth of this work. It may interest honourable senators to know that six
notices of contestation are by husbands who
are opposing the application of wives for
freedom from the bond of matrimony.
I am sure it will be of interest to point
out that the committee debated for some
time the problem of giving notice 0f the
petition to the co-respondent. One of the
arguments against it was that the co-respondent is sa often unknown. Well, I
rather doubted the evidence that came before
us so frequently that the co-respondent was
unknown. There may be some cases in
which the co-respondent is not known, but
flot very many. [t is rather interesting to
know that of the 31 notices of opposition
received s0 far this session, 3 are from. corespondents.
I argued previously that it
was unfair that divorce proceedings should
be instituted and in many cases carried to
completion without any officiai notice to the
co-respondent.
The number of applications ta, dispense
with the naming or serving of the corespondent were only 6 last session, and this

session there are only 7. That shows the
wisdom. of the change in the rules that we
adopted and which went into effect at the
beginning of last session. The reason generally advanced for flot naming the co-respondent is that he or she is unknown. That
may sometimes be true, and when it seems
to be true or is so proven the committee
allows the petitioner to proceed with the
case without serving the co-respondent.
For the information of those who are
interested in this matter I may state that
unopposed petitions are being listed for hearing at the rate of approximately 15 per day.
As my honourable colleagues know, we are
able to try that number daily by dividing the
committee into subcommittees which hear
the evidence and report to the general com.mittee, which in turn reports to the Senate.
Unopposed cases will be heard from
Monday through Friday for a two-week
period commencing Monday, May 26. Commencing June 9, the hearing 0f unopposed
petitions will be confined to Mondays and
Fridays, and opposed cases will be heard
on Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays.
I do appreciate the co-operation which I
receive as chairman of the Divorce Committee. 1 have already expressed my gratitude
to the honourable senator from TorontoSpadina (Hon. Mr. Croll) for the work he has
done as chairman of the committee which
hears the opposed cases. He will be hearing
opposed cases on Wednesdays and Thursdays,
and I will likely hear them on Tuesdays.
The assistance of Senator Croil has taken a
heavy burden off my shoulders.
I have given the house some incidentai
facts which I thought might be of interest
to my fellow senators.
REPORT 0F COMMITTEE

Han. Mr. Roebuck: Honourable senators,
I trust I may be pardoned for taking so much
time of the house. May I now give the first
report of the Divorce Committee, which reads
as follows:

quorum of three members; our general committee has always had many more than three
members.

given them to sit during ail adjournments of the
Senate. and also during sittings of the Senate.

We are sorry to have to ask for that privilege,

Hon. Mr. Roebuck: With leave of the Senate
I move, seconded by the Honourable Senator

The Senate proceeded to consideration of
the report of the Committee of Selection,
which was presented yesterday.
Hon. Mr. White moved that the report be

BUSINESS OF THE SENATE
Hon. Mr. Asel±ine: Honourable senators,
with leave of the Senate I move, seconded
by the Honourable Senator Horner, that when
the Senate adjourns today it do stand adjourned until eleven o'clock in the forenoon
tomorrow.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Probably the Honourable Leader of the Government (Hon. Mr.
Aseltine) will be good enough to explain
what business we can expect tomorrow, and
why we are adjourning now.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: There does not seem
to be much possibility of having the supply
bill here this afternoon in time for us to
deal with it in the way in which honourable
senators would want to deal with it; so, rather
than adjourn during pleasure and probably
have to come back two or three times, and
perhaps sit this evening, I have introduced
this motion, which I hope will pass, to meet
tomorrow morning. We expect that there
will then be before us another bill as well,
which is the second item on the order paper
in the other chamber, providing for extension
for a further period of unemployment insurance benefits. Benefits which have already
been extended under this measure will expire
tomorrow, and it is very necessary, I am
informed, that the bill shall receive the
attention of the Senate this week. We hope
it will reach us in time to be considered
tomorrow. As far as I know, these are the
only two measures which are likely to come
before us this week.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Can the Leader of the
Government advise us of the date on which
we shall return if we adjourn tomorrow?

APPOINTMENT

Hon. Mr. Aselline: Honourable senators,
I would ask that we now revert to the Order
of Motions so that I may present certain
motions resulting from the adoption of the
last report.
The Hon. the Speaker: Has the honourable
Leader the consent of the Senate?
Hon. Senators: Agreed.
Hon. Mr. Aselline, with leave of the Senate, moved:
That the senators mentioned in the second report
of the Committee of Selection as having been
chosen to serve on the several standing committees
during the present session, be and they are hereby
appointed to form part of and constitute the several
committees with which their respective names
appear in said report, to inquire into and report
upon such matters as may be referred to them from
time to time, and that the Committee on Standing
Orders be authorized to send for persons, papers
and records whenever required; and also that the
Committee on Internal Economy and Contingent
Accounts have power, without special reference by

Hon.

Mr. Roebuck: Honourable senators,

may I say a few words in connection with
that part of the motion which proposes the
giving of further authority to the Committee
on Internal Economy and Contingent Accounts? I would like to suggest that this
committee take into consideration certain
statements that have been made in the Senate
by my honourable friend from De la
Durantaye (Hon. Mr. Pouliot), myself and
others with regard to the Senate galleries.
At the opening of the First Session of the
Twenty-fourth Parliament on Monday a very
large and interested crowd filled our restricted galleries, the Senate chamber itself
and the space beyond the bar. It seems

APPROPRIATION BILL NO. 2, 1958
FIRST READING
The Hon. the Speaker informed the Senate
that a message had been received from the
House of Commons with Bill C-6, for granting
to Her Majesty certain sums of money for
the public service of the financial year ending
the 31st of March, 1959.
Bill read first time.
SECOND

READING

The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators,
when shall this bill be read the second time?
Hon. W. M. Aselline: With leave of the
Senate, I move the second reading now.
Hon. Mr. Reid: Is the bill going to be
distributed?
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: It is in honourable
senators' desks. I may say we had some difficulty in getting this bill here in printed
form this morning. I understand that yesterday when it was being considered in the
other place it was not available, but by doing
a considerable amount of work in that direction we were able to have it here this
morning.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Nice going.
Hon. Mr. Brunt: That's service.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: I will do my best,
honourable senators, to give a brief explanation of this measure, and later on I hope to
be able to answer any questions that may be
asked in connection with individual items.
Interim supply is an advance on account
and the usual measure is brought in at the
beginning of a session of Parliament providing for this advance.
If honourable senators will refer to the bill
they will find that section 2 provides for an
aggregate of one-sixth of all the items to be
voted in the main estimates for the fiscal
year 1958-1959; three-quarters of items 439,
443 and 502 of those estimates; one-half of
items 111, 200, 362, 409 and 513; one-quarter
of items 49, 148, 312 and 399; one-sixth of
items 37, 94, 162, 297, 311, 368, 432, 446 and
447; and one-twelfth of items 65, 74, 90, 98,

153, 163, 179, 224, 229, 234, 242, 246, 264, 333,
364, 391, 401, 402, 431, 479 and 485. The total
amount under this section is $626,292,380.09,
which includes the amounts authorized for
those items by the Governor General's warrants issued on April 9 and May 1, 1958.
May I say, honourable senators, that it is
not unusual to ask for one-sixth of the
estimates plus a larger portion of certain
items. This was done in the years 1952-53,
1953-54, 1954-55, 1955-56 and 1956-57. For
some items it is necessary to have a portion
in addition to the one-sixth because the Government has to keep its bills paid up. Having
entered into certain contracts, it has to make
certain payments so that those who are carrying out the contracts can pay their bills and
keep people employed. If necessary, I am prepared to go into all these items later on. I
have here quite a comprehensive brief dealing with each of these additional or "plus"
items I have mentioned. But I will leave this
for the moment and go to section 3.
This clause provides that the amount
authorized to be paid in respect of each item
may be paid only for the purposes specified
in the item, and that the authority given by
the wording of an item in this bill is valid
to the limit, but only to the limit, of the
amount provided for it in the bill.
Section 4 provides that contracts which
were entered into before the estimates were
tabled are confirmed. It is necessary, honourable senators, for the carrying on of public
business, that the Government shall enter
into contracts from time to time, and it is in
respect of these contracts that this clause
applies. Similar action was taken in 1926
and 1940. It was necessary at that time, and
is necessary this year, even though estimates
have not been tabled, because conditions arose
which resulted in two general elections in
one year.
Section 5 contains the usual authority to
borrow up to $1 billion during 1958-59. In
that connection I should like to give honourable senators some information. Each
year the supply bills contain new authority
to borrow money by means of the issue of
Canadian savings and other bonds and
treasury bills. From 1952-53 through 1954-55
authority to borrow up to $500 million was
granted annually. In 1955-56 the limit was
raised to $1 billion. In 1956-57 it was raised
to $1,500,000,000. Last year it was $1 billion.
The amount of $1 billion requested in this
bill is required to meet the issue of Canadian savings bonds and other market obligations in 1958. Canadian savings bonds issued
in 1957 total approximately $1,170,000,000.
By granting a general proportion of onesixth it is expected that all necessary requirements of the public service will be

MAY 15, 1958

provided for up to the end of May. This
supply bill covers only April and May, and
a new supply bill will have to be brought
in early in June to cover that month or the
next two months.
In no instance is the total amount of any
item being released. I would like to advise
honourable senators that the form of the bill
is similar in most respects to that of appropriation bills passed in previous years. The
provisions in new section 3 set out in definite
terms for the first time the principles which
have been accepted and acted upon down
through the years.
Section 4 of the bill is required to ratify
certain contracts that had to be entered into
and actions that had to be taken by the
Government before estimates could be tabled,
in order to ensure that essential services and
programs did not falter during the six weeks
of the current fiscal year.
The passing of this bill will not prejudice
or interfere in any respect with the rights
and privileges of honourable members to
criticize any item in the estimates when they
come before us for consideration. In other
words, the usual undertaking is hereby given
that such rights and privileges will be respected and will not be curtailed or restricted
in any manner whatsoever as a result of the
passing of this measure.
Honourable senators, that is a brief explanation of the bill. I have in my hand here
full details relating to schedules A, B, C, D
and E, and if information is required as to
any items therein I shall do my best to
give it.
Hon. W. Ross Macdonald: Honourable
senators, first of all I wish to compliment
my honourable friend (Hon. Mr. Aseltine)
on his very clear explanation of this bill,
the first he has presented to the house since
assuming his important role as Leader of
the Government in the Senate. I am sure
we are all pleased with the manner in which
he made this presentation, and we shall look
forward to similar presentations in the years
to come.
I do not propose to ask many questions,
but there are some observations I should
like to make. The leader referred to the
fact that the bill includes an expenditure
that has already been made during this
fiscal year under the authority of warrants
issued by the Governor General, in the
amount of $303,560,195. Well, that amount
has been spent between April 1 and May 15,
and there is very little we can do about it
now-it is gone, and we have no say in it.
That is not the only amount that has gone
in that manner. Parliament was dissolved
at the end of last January, and the estimates

for the fiscal year 1957-58 has not been approved by this house. It is true that we
had passed, I believe, five interim supply
bills, but on each occasion we reserved our
right to criticize or ask for further information regarding the items included in the
interim supply bill. By voting for those
bills we did not approve of the expenditures;
all we did was to put funds in the hands of
the Government so that it could pay current
bills. And so far as the bill now before us
is concerned, we are not approving of the expenditures for which it provides, but we
realize that the Government must make certain payments by the end of May and we are
prepared to advance the necessary money to
the Government. However, as I say, we
certainly are not approving of these expenditures; we are just putting the Government in funds.
In going back to the fiscal year 1957-58,
I find we passed five interim supply bills,
which provided for funds to the extent of
ten-twelfths of most of the items and eleventwelfths of some. I merely point that out
to impress upon honourable senators that
money bas been spent by the Government
without the approval of Parliament. Again,
before Parliament was convened and was not
in session, another considerable sum of
money-the amount that I mentioned, some
$303 million-was spent without the approval
of Parliament. I suppose by passing the
bill before us today we do approve that expenditure; but there is nothing we can do
about it-it has gone.
Honourable senators, yesterday afternoon
the Leader of the Government (Hon. Mr.
Aseltine) tabled in the bouse the estimates
for the fiscal year ending March 31, 1959.
We have just had a chance to glance at these
estimates since they were tabled, and I am
sure we were all astounded to learn the
total amount the Governmnt proposes to
spend during the fiscal year upon which we
have now entered. On page 3 of the estimates it will be observed that the total
estimated expenditures for this year are
$5,179,343,555, and this amount does not
include old age pension payments of $555
million. When that figure is added to the
estimates which have been tabled in this
bouse, the total proposed expenditure is
$5,734,343,555. That is an increase of $318
million over the total expenditures of last
year. I said "total expenditures", but of
course no honourable senator bas sat in this
house during any year when there has not
been at least one supplementary estimate
presented. I believe that last year there
were at least three supplementary estimates,
and probably there will be three this year.

SENATE
I also wish to point out that these estimates
do not include any expenditure on the South
Saskatchewan River project, or the proposed
railway to the Great Slave Lake, or the
proposed highways to the far north; nor do
they include very important, and probably
very large, expenditure for the federal Government's share of the National Hospital
Plan, which is to come into effect in some
provinces on July 1 this year. So during
the current financial year we shall spend
probably $6 billion, the largest annual federal
expenditure ever made in Canada.
The present Government, which has been
in power for less than a year, bas become the
most fabulous spender of public funds of
any government that has ever administered
the affairs of our country; and if the bill
before us is a simple bill, its simplicity consists only in its enormousness. I well remember when this Government was in opposition,
how it was going to reduce expenditures. The
claim was that a large sum-$500 million, I
believe-could easily be chopped off. Well,
the Government finds it is a little harder to
put into practice what it was preaching when
in opposition, and instead of there being a
reduction of $500 million, there is an increase
of at least $500 million over last year; in fact,
the increase over last year is nearer $1
billion than $500 million. On pages 2 and 3
of the estimates it will be observed that there
are only four departments in which there
has been any considerable reduction: Citizenship and Immigration, a reduction of
$1,054,000; Defence Production, a reduction
of $1,772,000; National Defence, a reduction
of $6,800,000; and in the Department of
Transport, for the Canadian Maritime Commission, a reduction of $242,900. In every
other department there bas been an increase.
Weil, honourable senators, I suppose the
country is getting larger-there are more
people here and more demands are being
made on the treasury. As to how the money
is to be raised, no proposal has yet been presented to the house, and I would not expect
it. We were all disappointed last year that
there was not a budget, but we won't be
disappointed this year.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: I assure the honourable
senator there will be one this year.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: We know there will
be a budget this year. How the money is to
be found I do not know, but we look forward
with great interest to learning this. And of
course, honourable senators, that raises a
very important question as to whether we
are going into a period of budgeting for deficits, whether we are entering into a period
of inflation. But I will not take the time of
the house now to go into those matters. They

present very serious problems and I have no
doubt that the Government itself is greatly
concerned about them.
Honourable senators, I have read the bill
carefully and of course I will vote for it. As
the honourable leader (Hon. Mr. Aseltine) has
said, it is similar in form to other interim
supply bills that have been presented to us.
This bill, I think, is some improvement on
former bills, in that clause 2 sets forth the
extent of the expenditures more clearly than
previous bills did. I have one of the previous
bills before me and in it there was one clause
covering items for which one-twelfth of their
total was being asked. There was another
clause applying to items for which we were
asked to vote one-sixth of their total, and
so forth. There were nine such clauses in that
bill, but in the present bill all the proportions
of the various items to be voted are set out
more clearly in one clause, namely, clause 2.
I was interested in the remarks of the
Leader of the Government with respect to
clause 3. If honourable senators will refer
to the bill they will notice that this clause
reads:
3. The amount authorized by this act to be
paid or applied iri respect of an item may be
paid or applied only for the purposes and subject
to any terms and conditions specified in the item,
and the payment or application of any amount
pursuant to the item bas such operation and effect
as may be stated or described thercin.

That clause never appeared previously in
an Appropriation Bill. I would like to know
from the honourable Leader of the Government why it is found necessary to put the
clause in this bill. Have moneys been improperly expended in the past? Is not that
covered by a provision of the Financial Administration Act?
If honourable senators will notice the bill
again they will see that clause 6 reads:
6. Amounts paid or applied under the authority
of this act shall be accounted for in the Public
Accounts in accordance with section 64 of the
Financial Administration Act.

There was a similar clause in previous bills.
I do not recall that we ever used funds for
a purpose other than that for which they were
provided.
Another unusual clause in the bill is clause
4. It provides that contracts entered into
after the 31st of March 1958 but before the
13th of May 1958 for any of the purposes
specified in any of the items set forth in
those estimates are hereby ratified and confirmed. So by passing this bill we approve of
whatever contracts the Government has entered into between the 31st of March and the
13th of May. I am going to ask the Leader
of the Government if he is going to table

MAY 15, 1958
those contracts? Do we know what the contracts contain? However, I am not going to
ask the Leader of the Government to hold
up the bill today.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: I think those are in the
estimates now. They are contracts which
were made before the estimates were brought
down. The same thing was done in previous
years, as I explained in my remarks a few
minutes ago.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: They were not in any
interim supply bills that were passed last
year, and I do not recall them appearing in
any interim supply bill. I think the Leader
of the Government said that it was in an
Interim Supply Bill in 1926.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: In 1926 and 1940, when
it was impossible to bring down the estimates
on account of circumstances which prevailed
at the time. But they were included in the
estimates when the estimates were brought
down.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I have looked through
the estimates and cannot get any information
there about any contracts that were entered
into between the 31st of March and the 13th
of May. The honourable leader refers to the
years 1926 and 1940. I have not read Hansard
of those years, and it is possible that the then
leader gave the house some information about
the contracts of that time. I do not know.
But we have no information about the contracts referred to in clause 4 of this bill, so
by approving of them we shall be voting
blindly. However, as I said, I am not going
to ask that the bill be held up in order that
we may obtain the information. When the
Leader of the Government brings down the
next interim supply bill he may be able to
enlighten us with respect to these contracts.
Clause 5 gives the Governor in Council
power to raise a loan of $1 billion for public
works and general purposes. The honourable Leader of the Government said it is
usual to pass a supply bill containing that
or a similar clause. I have some recollection
of such a clause, but I am not clear on it.
However, I have looked up interim supply
bills passed by this house at the last session,
and I do not see a similar clause. Is it suggested that this clause was previously set
forth by itself in a separate bill? Certainly,
it is unusual to have such a clause in a bill
of this nature. Probably the leader can
give us some further information on it.
Honourable senators, I have no further
remarks to make on the bill. As I said in
my opening remarks, the purpose of the bill
is largely to put the Government in funds
to pay its bills which must be paid, up to
the end of this month. At the end of this

month we will doubtless receive another
interim supply bill to put the Government
in funds to make another payment.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: Honourable senators,
may I deal first with the question of contracts? I believe the Government has no
objection whatever to tabling the contracts,
though I do not know how much effort it
would take to pile them on the table, as
there may be a large number of them.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Probably we might
have a summary of them.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: I will look into that
matter further, honourable senators.
I think it will be found that a clause
similar to clause 5 appeared in the second
Appropriation Bill last year.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Maybe.
Hon. Mr. Asefline: Probably such a clause
was not in the first supply bill.
With regard to section 3, may I repeat what
I said earlier, that the provisions of this new
section describe in definite terms for the first
time the principles that have been accepted
and acted upon during the years. The section
is just a safeguard, but I think it is important
and should be there.
Hon. Arthur W. Roebuck: Honourable
senators, we are considering a motion for
supply and, as I understand it, I am in order
in making some general remarks regarding
some of the matters referred to in the bill.
For instance, I see it appropriates some
money for the Department of Labour, and
that brings up almost everything that has
recently taken place in connection with
labour. We have just gone through an important strike on one of the railways. As
that strike has been settled, the differences
between the parties is a thing of the past,
and I am not particularly concerned with
it. What I am concerned with at the moment
is the position of John Q. Public in connection with these matters.
The Canadian Pacific Railway seems to
have won the strike, so far as the men are
concerned, but, so far as I know, no attention has been paid by the Prime Minister or
by the Minister of Labour to the effect of
this settlement on the general public and the
safety of the travelling public.
I happened to have sat as a member of
the Board of Conciliation which heard the
evidence in connection with these matters
over a period of about three weeks. We heard
no less than 50 witnesses. In that connection,
of course, I learned something of the matters
in issue, and I made a report in which I
considered the interests of the public as well
as those of the two contesting parties. I
would like now to call to the attention of

SENATE

the house something that I said in that
report, because so very little publicity was
given to anything said for the public or for
the firemen. I congratulate the C.P.R. on the
effectiveness of its propaganda. Different persons have said to me that the firemen seemed
to have no case at all, and from reading
the newspapers or listening to the radio one
would come to that conclusion. However, I
fancy there is no one in this house so simple
or naive as to believe that one side of a
great argument of this nature had no case
at all.
As I say, I am not arguing the case for
one side or the other of the contest. What I
am disturbed about at the moment is the
interest of the public. Perhaps one or two
paragraphs in my report to the Minister of
Labour may be of interest to my colleagues.
This of course is now a public document.
I said:
Through the courtesy of counsel for the Canadian
Pacific Railway, the members of the board were
permitted to visit the railway yards at Ottawa and
to there observe an actual switching operation

engineer's seat and peered through the window

engineer's left is a great square box housing the
diesel engine which towers two feet or more above
his head and extends forward some thirty feet.
With the exception of what little he can see at
right angles through the fireman's side window,
the whole left-hand forward view is blank, and
when the cab is followed by a passenger or box
car the same may be said of the left-hand rear
view: it is blank. The engineer can, of course,
look forward as well as to the right but, obviously
with the 30-foot wall obstructing his left-hand
vision, the track is lost to bis view whenever the
track curves to the left.
The sane conditions
reversed confront the fireman on the left side
of the cab, and he can see nothing of the track
ahead when the road swings to the right.
It is plainly obvious that such locomotives are
designed for two-man operation. That a one-man
drive was never contemplated by the producers of
these machines is made clear by the fact that
to look through the fireman's front-view window,
the engineer must abandon all his controls. He
cannot reach the throttle or the brake while he
is on the fireman's side. This is a condition which
no sane engineer would contemplate while the
locomotive is in motion. There was some talk of
installing dual controls, but this is purely prospective as none are as yet available on the diesels of
the Canadian Pacific Railway or of any other railway so far as I know.
Nevertheless, the company proposes removing
the fireman, if they are permitted to do su, and
to attempt to avoid the perils of one-man operation and running blind by an alteration in the
rules requiring the switching crew in yard service
to do the watching from their positions on the

crew, one of whom is to be the engine follower.
They are to work on the right side of the engine
at all times so that they can give signalled orders
directly to the engineer and they are to be responsible for what occurs on the left side of the train,
which they cannot see, as well as for conditions
on the right side, which they can see, except when
the train is rounding a left-hand curve. Under

these conditions the engine follower is to ride on
what used to be called the cowcatcher of steam
locomotives.
In all switching yards there are one or more
lead tracks off which other tracks radiate. Groups
of cars are sorted by running the train back and
forth on the lead track and shunting cars down
the radial tracks to be later picked up and
assembled in desired order. These radial tracks
may branch off to either the right or left. When
they join the lead track on the left side of the
train they are within the range of vision of the
fireman and not of the engineer. Were the fireman removed, a movement on a left-hand radial
track could occur unobserved by those on the right
side of the train including both engineer and
ground crew, and a collision result.

That is what I wrote about yard switching
where there is no head-end brakeman, and
only two men ride on the locomotive. It is
now proposed to run the locomotive blind in
that way with one man on the right-hand
side. These diesel engines were designed for
a two-man operation. This is only one
condition which I pointed out, and which in
my opinion is dangerous to the public.
I now call attention to the fact that a mere
settlement betweeen the contending parties
such as has now taken place is not a settlement so far as the public is concerned. The
public was not represented and was not
heard. I hold the Government responsible
for what may occur, should the railway carry
out its intention to run locomotives blind in
yard service.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: Why hold the Government responsible?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Because

the Govern-

ment took part in the negotiations and made
no arrangement to protect the public. The
Government is responsible for such major
changes. The Board of Transport Commissioners are responsible, and they in turn are
responsible to the Government. If there is
a dangerous condition-and I contend there is
-the authorities in charge of affairs should
take notice of it, and see that the public is
properly protected.
Hon. Mr. Lamber±: May I ask the honourable senator if the Board of Transport Commissioners, on the basis of a stated case,
taking into consideration the dangers which
have been enumerated here, would be
competent to rule that added staff be provided
for?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Yes. If someone would
take a stated case to the Board of Transport
Commissioners it would bring this matter
before them, and something of that nature
should be done. The matter could be referred
to the Board of Transport Commissioners by
the cabinet. I know of no other way of
bringing it before the board, other than by

MAY 15, 1958
a stated case being brought by someone who
takes the initiative on the part of the Government or the Department of Labour.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: Is it not possible for
the labour representatives themselves to bring
a case before the Board of Transport Commissioners?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Why should the labour
representatives bring such a case? Labour
has already spent large sums of money
defending its rights. It is no more responsible
for the public safety than you or I. I have
some responsibility; that is why I rise in
my place today on a supply bill in order
to bring this matter to public notice. All of
us, I think, are in some degree responsible,
and certainly the Department of Labour is
responsible.
Hon. Mr. Bruni: Would the honourable
senator permit one question?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Certainly.
Hon. Mr. Bruni: Does the honourable
senator advocate that the Government shall
step in, cancel and set aside the settlement
which was made in Montreal last Monday
evening? No Government representative was
present when this settlement was made. Is
the honourable senator now urging that this
agreement, which was reached by the firemen's union and the Canadian Pacific Railway
Company be set aside and cancelled?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: How anybody could
draw such a conclusion from my words I
don't know.
Hon. Mr. Bruni: Well, the honourable
senator blames the Government.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: I said in my opening
remarks that the contest between these
parties was a thing of the past; it has been
settled. But the problem as it affects the
public is still open, and public danger and
protection are matters of Government responsibility. I am not suggesting a cancellation
of the settlement. The parties have agreed
between themselves, and I am not touching
on that subject at all. We are not concerned
with their interests; they can take care of
themselves. All I am talking about is John Q.
Public, whose interest was not represented,
except incidentally, either before the commission or the board of conciliation. The
public interest was used as an argument
only, and now I am calling attention to this
most important question. If I may be permitted, I will read a further portion of my
report:
There are few workers in the industrial life of
Canada who bear so terrible a responsibility as
that of the locomotive engineer in charge of a
modern train.
I know, for I have defended
engineers charged with manslaughter for having
overlooked a meet or miscalculating the time of

arrival of an oncoming train. The engineer of a
freight train in road service is furnished with a
timetable of approaching trains, from which, as
varied by dispatchers' advices, he plots his own
progress from one passing track to another. There
may be several trains approaching each of which
has right of way superior to his own, and all of
which may be on schedules varied by dispatchers'
orders. He is required to dodge from station
to station, letting these superior trains go by, and
he is expected to make time.
In addition, he
watches the track ahead, observes the whistle
posts, and the various train signals, while he
supervises the mechanical operation of his big
machine, which is not always in perfect mechanical
condition; all this while he actually operates the
locomotive with his foot on the throttle and his
hand on the brake, as engineman in road service.

It is a major change that is being proposed,
and all I am doing is calling the attention
of the authorities whom I hold responsible
for public safety to what is going on, and
saying that we of this chamber, so far as
I can speak for us all, will hold the authorities responsible for any increase in the
number of deaths on our tracks. Too many
people are killed at level crossings. Too many
accidents occur in yard service, where the
staff of the train are required to cross the
tracks, where there are actual roads across
the tracks, and where people, including
children, are frequently to be found. The
service is a dangerous one, and to put such
a locomotive under the operation of one man
is, I think, a very doubtful procedure. As to
what action should be taken I am not now
ready to say, but the proper action should be
taken, and by the Department of Labour
or the Government itself. I call their attention
to this condition, and I shall personally hold
them responsible for the results.
Hon. Mr. Haig: May I ask the honourable
senator whether his report, with others, was
not submitted to the royal commission, composed of judges, who reviewed this matter?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Oh, I don't know
whether or not they did me the honour of
reading my report. How can I tell that?
Nor do I know what evidence was presented
to them. All I do know is that they made
a report, which I have read, and with which
-as I have the right to do-I disagree. It
is true that I was in the minority, but I am
frequently in that position, and it does not
greatly disturb me. However, I have not
changed my views with regard to the
interests of the public in this regard because
of the reports made by the other jurists.
Hon. Jean-François Pouliot: Honourable
senators, our honourable colleague from
Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck) has
said something with which everybody must
agree-that the number of railway accidents,
especially at crossings, is quite disturbing.
But one may not forget that the railroads

SENATE

have the right of way on their tracks, and
that most of these accidents are due to the
There
negligence of automobile drivers.
cannot be too many notices put at crossings
in order to warn motorists to be very careful, when they come to a place of this kind,
to stop their cars and so avoid accidents
which may be fatal, not only to themselves,
but to those who ride with them. On this
matter everybody is in agreement. Indeed
it is impossible to disagree, and it is easy
to admit that the federal Government, as
well as all the provincial Governments, are
taking every opportunity of telling motorists
to be especially careful when they come to
a railway crossing. This point is not contentious; we all agree with it, and we deplore
the numerous fatalities which occur every
year, and which should be reduced to the
strict minimum.
As regards the strike to which the honourable senator has referred, there are
several other points which should be considered. There was a royal commission which
included three judges, one of them, Mr.
Justice Kellock, then a member of the
Supreme Court of Canada. I have the highest
regard for the bench. As my honourable
friend from Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck) pointed out last year, our judges deserve the respect of all, even when we
disagree with them. And on that occasion
my honourable friend, after having enunciated that principle in a broad manner,
blamed me for differing with the judges. I
understand very well that the judges are far
from being infallible, and whether it is a
justice of the peace or a judge of the
Supreme Court it makes no difference. It is
human to err, and perhaps today my honourable friend was right. Perhaps his contention is well-founded, better founded than
that of Mr. Justice Kellock. It is in the
domain of possibility.
But if my honourable colleagues are interested in the conditions of railway employees, they cannot be any more interested than
I was for 31 years when I represented 800
railway employees who were working in the
shops at Rivière du Loup, and on trains
running from there to Campbellton and to
Charny. I had a great affection for them and
when they were in trouble they used to come
to see me, just as many people go to see
their member of Parliament. They would say,
"Jean-François, we have come to you because the union will do nothing for us."
They would tell me their troubles and I
would sympathize with them and go to Moncton, Montreal and Toronto to discuss matters
with officials of the Canadian National Railway. Often did I encounter difficulty with
regard to their seniority. There were only

chairmen at Rivière du Loup, and I had
many arguments with the general chairmen
who were at Moncton. They were very greedy
for themselves, their relatives and friends,
and everything had to go to them. When the
Rivière du Loup erecting shop was closed, it
was at first impossible to come to an understanding with the general chairmen at Moncton. I took the matter up with Mr. Smith of
Montreal, a very nice gentleman, who seemed
to realize that I was right, but he could
not tell me so because he was a high officer
of the union. Then I came to Ottawa to see
Mr. Bengough, who was the head of the
Trades and Labour Congress of Canada. He
listened to me with attention and seemed
to be sympathetic, but I had to wait until I
got in touch with Mr. Meany in Washington.
Then, with the assistance of Mr. Gregg, who
was Minister of Labour, I succeeded in having
a better treatment for my constituents.
My honourable friend from Toronto-Trinity
knows that he could not represent any member of a railway union in any investigation
where that member's fate was at stake. We
are not allowed by the unions to represent
them as solicitors and attorneys, and my
friend knows that. They don't want us.
They prefer to do their business alone, and
it happens that railway employees are often
represented by fellow employees who do
not know anything about their case. Statements may be signed blindly by the
employees concerned; these people are left
in the hands of the railway superintendent
or the investigator, who has a right of life
or death over them.
It is the duty of a member of Parliament
to take care of railway employees who are
not protected and looked after by the unions
to which they have contributed large sums
of money from their salaries every month,
as a union fee.
When the strike of 1950 came I was called
by the strikers themselves to speak. I told
them, "Gentlemen, how many times have I
had to fight the leaders of your unions in
order to protect your rights and to protect
And then some of them
you yourselves?"
said, "That is true, Jean-François." It was
one of the greatest tributes ever paid me.
But I have seldom been impressed by the
railway unions with whom I had to deal
quite often. How many times have employees
been criticized for going to their members
of Parliament to get some help and protection?
With regard to the last railway strike,
my honourable friend is inspired by worthy
motives in saying that he wants to protect
human lives by having two men, an engineer
and a fireman, in the cabs of locomotives in
the yards and on the freight trains. He may

MAY 15, 1958
be right. I do not say be is wrong, but the
matter has been considered by a judge of
the Supreme Court of Canada, the highest
tribunal in the country.
My friend has
reached a conclusion different from that of
the judge. Now, I am sure that my honourable colleague drives his car well. He has
no footman sitting next to him when he
drivesHon. Mr. Roebuck: I can see out both
sides of my car.
Hon. Mr. Pouliot: Yes, I know, and my
honourable friend can see all around him
with a good mirror in front of him. The
engineers can see very well too. When they
go backwards it takes special care, but what
is important for an engineer, especially on a
single track, is to see ahead of him. He has
to see behind him only when be goes backwards. When be goes ahead his vision is
clear and be can see any other locomotive
coming towards him. The only thing be
may not see is an automobile coming across
the track. Sometimes automobiles are hidden from his view by shrubbery, trees, a
fence, a house and so on. If automobile drivers
were as careful at the wheel as the locomotive engineers are at the throttle, there
would be very few accidents at railway
crossings.
At first I was opposed to diesel locomotives,
for many reasons which I have given to the
Railways and Shipping Committee of the
other bouse, but I did not have the support
of the union leaders who wear a big gold
chain, smoke a big cigar and receive a
salary often higher than that of the Prime
Minister of Canada.
Honourable senators, I do not want to be
called unfair or uniust to the cause of labour,
but I do not believe union leaders are infallible. Moreover, I was rather indignant
when I heard that a Mr. Gilbert of Cleveland
ordered Canadian railway men to go on
strike. How is it that the union is in the
hands of an American citizen across the
boundary, giving orders to Canadians, orders
that cannot be controlled by anyone, neither
by a minister of labour nor anybody else,
until labour legislation is amended to provide for all-Canadian unions? I find it absurd
that the railway men of Canada received
their directions from a gentleman they never
met-the big head of the union who is maintained there on account of the trips enjoyed
by a few employees who attend the conventions. I hope the day will come before my
political career is over when the Canadian
union will not be run by American citizens,
worthy or not of that honour.
Now that the strike is over, it is to be
hoped that the matter will be considered

closed. The Canadian Pacific Railway and
Canadian National Railways are making
sacrifices in order to give the best possible
service. One has only to look at the timetables for trains running between this capital
city of Ottawa and any other point in Canada
to see that I am not exaggerating. It is
easy for anyone to say that he is for the
men and that they are unjustly treated by
the management of either railway system.
Sometimes they may be, but when I feel
in my heart that they are unjustly treated I
will rise from my place in the Senate to
defend them. But in this case the president
and management of the C.P.R. have acted as
a good family father. And why did the
president have to come to that conclusion
to remove one man from the cab? It was
precisely on account of the exaggerated
demands of the labour unions in order to
justify their existence. Are they not responsible to a large extent for what is called
inflation? They never miss an opportunity
to tell how indispensable they are. Whether
one agrees or not with my views, I have
known railway employees for a long time,
and I can say that those I met during the
strike were nearly all opposed to it, and if
there was a free vote of confidence among
the employees the union leaders would have
very little power and authority.
Once I told the late Honourable Humphrey
Mitchell, at the time of the Detroit strike,
"You should speak to the men above the
heads of the union leaders". A year afterwards he said to me, "What we should do in
railway strikes, and all other strikes, and
to prevent them, is to speak to the men above
the heads of the union leaders".
Hon. John J. Connolly:
Honourable
senators, I rise not to protract this branch
of the debate, but principally because I think
we may all be concerned with one phase of
the remarks that have been made by my good
and honourable friend from Toronto-Trinity
(Hon. Mr. Roebuck). I refer particularly to
his remarks about the position of the public
in the light of the settlement of the strike
against the Canadian Pacific Railway. As
members of this chamber, indeed as members of Parliament, we are all vitally interested in the protection of the public as far
as we can be. I think perhaps we should
stop and consider whether or not the honourable gentleman was warranted in going as
far as he did in the remarks be made. I
realize that be did sit upon the board of conciliation. I realize also that very few people
in Parliament have an understanding of the
details of this issue to compare with his own.
That board of conciliation was followed by
the stoppage of the trains in January of 1957,

SENATE
if I recall rightly, after which the Government of the day was faced with the problem
of what was happening to the economy while
the strike went on. As a result of considerable
effort, and after a good many days of work,
a royal commission was set up. Now, the
Government need not have set up that royal
commission. Perhaps the matter could have
been referred to a single judge or to a different kind of board. The matter might even
have been referred to the Board of Transport
Commissioners, which deals with matters of
this kind.
However, a royal commission was set upand I believe it was after agreement between
both of the parties that the Government took
that step. The members of that royal commission were a judge of the Supreme Court of
Canada, then Mr. Justice Kellock; a judge of
the Court of Appeal of the province of
Quebec, Mr. Justice Jean Martineau; and the
Chief Justice of the Trial Division in the
Supreme Court of Alberta, Mr. Justice Colin
Campbell McLaurin. I think it can be said
that this was a fair and impartial body, a
body that was ready to look into this serious
problem without any sense of partiality at all.
They were men who were accustomed to considering problems of this kind in a
judicial way.
Both parties appeared before that royal
commission, called any witnesses they cared
to call and argued fully. I understand that the
commission not only examined conditions in
this country on the ground, but travelled to
other countries, including some in Europe.
Just how many countries it visited I do
not know.
As I say, that investigation might have
been undertaken by the Board of Transport
Commissioners, but in view of the volume of
work that board has to do every year, it
seems to me that it was much more sensible
to appoint an independent royal commission
which would devote its entire time to this
very important problem. It is important not
only to railways, I should say, but to other
branches of industry. It may recur many
times because of this whole problem of
automation.
The commission sat for many months. Its
report, which was published some weeks ago,
was unanimous. After an investigation of
that kind it seems to me that members of
Parliament and indeed members of the general public should feel that the public interest
has been served, and that the conclusions
which the commission reached unanimously
are entitled to public acceptance.
Without being critical, I think perhaps my
honourable friend from Toronto-Trinity rather
weakened his case when he referred to the

propaganda activity of the railway. I repeat,
I do not say this critically, for I am aware
of the high sense of public responsibility that
he has. But in my opinion the company was
justified, as it seems to me the general public
and many honourable members of this chamber were justified, in feeling that the conclusions of that royal commission should be
accepted. Moreover, I think this should be
said on behalf of the company, that while it
continued through the last negotiations to
reaffirm the principles embodied in the commission's report, it nevertheless retreated to
the extent of helping a good many employees,
over 400 I believe, to retain seniority rights
that they had built up within their own union
and in their own trade. I suggest it speaks
very well for management and for that particular management that this was done. I rise
today only to say that while I realize that the
honourable gentleman's remarks, as he quoted
them from his own report of the conciliation
board, reflected the kind of finding that he
honestly and sincerely felt should have been
made, I believe we all are justified in relying upon the later conclusions of the royal
commission in the light of the circumstances
which developed since the time the conciliation board reported.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Honourable senators,
may I, as a matter of privilege, say I did not
blame the honourable senator from De la
Durantaye (Hon. Mr. Pouliot) for differing
with the judges. What I said was that his
differing was a matter of importance. I said,
moreover, that he had a perfect right to
differ.
Motion agreed to and bill read second time.

PETITION FOR PRIVATE BILL
MERCANTILE AND GENERAL REINSURANCE
COMPANY OF CANADA LIMITED
Hon.

William

R.

Bruni:

Honourable

senators, I have the honour to present a
petition from The Mercantile and General
Reinsurance Company of Canada Limited
praying for the passing of an act increasing
the capital stock of this company.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Explain.

Hon. Mr. Bruni: Briefly, what the company
wants to do is to increase its capitalization
from $1 million to $5 million. This has been

made necessary for two reasons. First, companies that have been writing fire and

MAY 15, 1958
casualty insurance have suffered some terrific
losses, and this company feels that as a result
it should increase its capitalization. Secondly,
its business has been growing year by year
and it considers that it will require additional
capital in order to carry on in the future.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Thank you.
BUSINESS OF THE SENATE
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Honourable senators,
as I mentioned yesterday, there is another
bill which will likely reach us this afternoon.
The resolution was introduced in the other
house last evening.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: That is for an extension of unemployment insurance benefits?
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Yes, an extension of
benefits under the Unemployment Insurance
Act for a further period. I do not know
exactly when that bill will be passed in the
other house, but the Government is anxious
to have it passed and receive Royal Assent
along with the Appropriation Bill later today.
Certaintly, the bill will not reach us before
3 o'clock this afternoon, because the other
house does not sit until 2.30 p.m.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald:
Thursday morning?

Does it not sit on

Hon. Mr. Aseltine: It does during the debate on the Speech from the Throne, but that
debate has been postponed to allow these
bills to go through.
I would suggest, honourable senators, that
we adjourn during pleasure, to reassemble
at the call of the bell at approximately 4 p.m.
The Senate adjourned during pleasure.
At 4 p.m. the sitting was resumed.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Honourable senators,
apparently my optimism was misplaced, or
too great, because in the other chamber, from
which I have just returned, they are still on
the resolution stage of the bill to Amend the
Unempolyment Insurance Act. I would therefore suggest that this chamber now rise, to
meet again at eight o'clock this evening.
Hon. Mr. Reid: You are still optimistie!
The Senate adjourned during pleasure.
At 8.50 p.m. the sitting was resumed.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Honourable senators,
I must apologize that the proceedings of the
Senate have been held up, but owing to
printing difficulties and other matters over
which I have absolutely no control the Unemployment Insurance Bill was not proceeded
with in the House of Commons until 8

o'clock. However, I understand it has now
been passed there and will be introduced
in this house tonight.
UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE BILL
FIRST READING

The Hon. the Speaker informed the Senate
that a message had been received from the
House of Commons with Bill C-9, for the temporary extension of seasonal benefit periods
under the Unemployment Insurance Act.
Bill read first time.
SECOND READING
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, when shall this bill be read the second
time?
Hon. W. M. Aseltine: Honourable senators,
with leave of the Senate I move that this
bill be read the second time now.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Have copies of the
bill been distributed?
Hon. William R. Brunt: I think that only
100 copies were printed, and after the bill
was passed in the other chamber we sent
two employees to gather them up and bring
them over here. We thought we had enough
for every honourable senator. Here is my
copy of the bill, if anyone wants it.
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): There
is no shortage of money for their printing, is
there?
Hon. Mr. Brunt: No. Is there any honourable senator on the other side of the house
who has not received a copy of the bill? If
there is, we will try to gather copies from
our side and send them over.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I suppose senators on
your own side also are interested to know
what is in the bill.
Hon. Mr. Bruni: Honourable senators, this
bill is entitled an act for the temporary
extension of seasonal benefit periods under
the Unemployment Insurance Act. At the
outset I think I should point out that if the
bill passes and becomes an act of Parliament
it will be in effect only from the 18th of
May 1958 to the 28th day of June 1958.
At the present time two classes of persons
are entitled to receive benefits under the Unemployment Insurance Act. Firstly, there are
those persons who are entitled to receive
what are called regular benefits. They are
people who are steadily employed and who
may periodically become unemployed. They
draw employment insurance benefits during
that time, and when their jobs open up again
they go back to work. This bill does not
apply to those people, but rather it applies

SENATE
to the second class, which consists solely of
those persons who are entitled to receive
what are called seasonal benefits.
Of those who are entitled to receive seasonal benefits there are two classes. The first
class consists of persons as described and
defined in paragraph (a) of section 50, as dealt
with in the explanatory notes: in other words,
persons who have had at least 15 contribution weeks subsequent to the most recent
Saturday preceding the 31st day of March
immediately before the day on which they
make their claims. The second class is clearly
defined by paragraph (b) of section 50 under
the explanatory notes. They are persons
whose most recent benefit periods terminated
after the week in which fell the 15th day of
May immediately preceding the day on which
they make their claim. As an example, let
us suppose that a seasonal worker is entitled
to receive unemployment benefits at say $30
a week-which is the top figure-for a period
of 20 weeks. Under the present legislation
his benefit would end on the 17th day of May
1958, even though he had not drawn his unemployment insurance at the rate of $30 for
20 weeks. Such a worker might have drawn
his benefit for only ten weeks. Under the bill
he will be entitled to draw unemployment
insurance benefits at the rate of $30 a week
up to six weeks, but in no event beyond the
28th day of June 1958. The bill provides for
such a worker a maximum extension of six
weeks during which he can draw his benefits,
provided he has sufficient credit in the fund
so that the six weeks' payments can be made
to him. If he has not a sufficient credit in
the fund to make the payment for six weeks
his payments will have to stop when his
credit is used up. The bill does not allow
any worker, whether of the permanent class
or the seasonal class, to withdraw money
from the fund unless he has a credit there.
He cannot create an overdraft-that would
not do, but the bill does allow him to draw
up to the amount of his credit in the fund.
I think everyone will agree that this is a
most necessary and fair extension of the
benefits to which a worker is entitled under
the Unemployment Insurance Act.

Hon. Mr. Bruni: No. There are different
classes, depending upon the amount of money
the worker earns each week. Indeed, the $30
payment is the maximum amount anyone can
receive out of the fund.
Hon. Mr. Hawkins: Can the honourable
gentleman tell me why, if a worker has a
credit in the fund, there is any need for a
special act?
Hon. Mr. Bruni: No, I cannot tell my
honourable friend that. We have to have
the act in order to get the benefits out for
the worker. This just applies to seasonal
employees, not to regular employees.
Hon. Mr. Hawkins: But if he has a credit
in the fund, what is the need for a special
act? I cannot see the need for it.
Hon. Mr. Bruni: I agree with you, but we
are told that we have to have this act so
that they can get the benefits out to the
seasonal employees.
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Otiawa West): Does the

questions as we go along?
Hon. Mr. Bruni: No, I shall be very happy
to do so; at least, I shall try.
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): We are
all out of order if we ask questions without
your consent. Could the honourable gentleman say when the season stops for a seasonal
worker? Is there a termination date?
Hon. Mr. Bruni: The 17th of May is when
the payments stop for seasonal workers,
regardless of how much a worker has in the
fund.
Hon. Mr. Reid: A seasonal worker is not
one with a steady job, is that right?
Hon. Mr. Bruni: That is right.
Hon. Mr. Hawkins: Does this cover a
worker who has never paid into the fund?
Hon. Mr. Bruni: Oh, no. Of course, if he
has no credit in the fund he cannot get anything out of it.

Hon. Mr. Hawkins: You said a moment
ago if he had no credit in the fund he could
not come under this act.
Hon. Mr. Bruni: Well, each week that a

SENATE
to serve a waiting period consisting of a
week's benefit. By this bill that provision is
eliminated, as it applies to seasonal workers.
Subsection (2) of section 50 would do away
with the waiting period for a person who
applies for seasonal benefits on or after May
18, 1958 and before June 28, 1958.
Section 52 of this bill repeats section 52
of the present act which prevents a worker
from having two seasonal benefit periods under which he would withdraw from the fund
more than his credit in the fund. In other
words, it prevents an overdraft. For anyone
to qualify for benefits under the unemployment insurance fund he must have a credit
balance; he cannot have an overdraft. However, a worker can draw weekly seasonal
benefit payments at different times. For instance, he could be out of work for two
weeks and draw benefits, then return to work
for a week, then be out of work and again
draw benefits, provided of course that his
total drawings never exceed the amount to
his credit in the fund, and provided also that
his drawings are made by him in the specified
period, namely, from May 18, 1958 to June 28,
1958.
Hon. Mr. Reid: He does not have the
waiting period?
Hon. Mr. Bruni: There is no waiting period.
Immediately a seasonal worker becomes unemployed he is entitled to receive benefits.
That advantage is not extended to the regular worker who participates in the fund.
I reiterate that section 2, to me a very
important section, prevents any person from
receiving any benefits out of the fund if he
has exhausted his seasonal benefit credit
in the fund.
Finally, I would point out that upon the
bill being passed by this house and becoming
an act of Parliament it will have no effect of
any kind whatsoever after the 28th day of
June, 1958. In other words all the provisions
of this bill will be automatically spent, in
the absence of further legislation, on the
28th of June next.
In closing, I would like to advise the bouse
that, according to information which bas been
furnished to me from the Unemployment
Insurance Commission, it is estimated that
200,000 claimants will benefit under the provisions of this bill, and it is further estimated
that they will benefit in the amount of
approximately $14 million.
Hon. W. Ross Macdonald: Honourable
senators, we have not much time to study
this bill, and I must admit that I am not
perfectly clear as to its provisions. With all
due respect to the honourable gentleman who
introduced the bill, I do not think that a

man has to have to his credit in the unemployment insurance fund an amount as great
as he will draw under the provisions of the
bill. What the man will need to have is a
certain number of contributions to the fund,
and as I understand the provisions, if he has
made, let us say-I am not sure of my
figures-24 contributions he will be entitled
to seasonal benefits for 20 weeks; and of
course his weekly drawing is much larger
than his weekly contribution.
Hon. Mr. Bruni: A great deal.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: So when the honourable gentleman used the words "credit in
that fund", what he meant, I suppose, was
that he would be entitled to draw from the
fund because he had made a sufficient number
of contributions to it to enable him to qualify.
Hon. Mr. Bruni: Well, after all, contributions are made in money, and that is why I
say it is a credit in the fund. He bas got a
credit of so many dollars in the fund.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Yes, but the amount
of dollars he has in the fund does not equal
the amount of dollars that he draws. I do
not know what his weekly contribution is, but
it is comparatively small; the employer and
the Government each pay in the same amount,
and the Government also provides the cost of
administration. Then, when the man becomes
unemployed, he draws much more per week
than the total amount he has paid in.
Hon. Mr. Bruni: Yes. But what the
employer and the Government pay in are
credited to him, and he is also credited with
his own payments.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I agree, but these
weekly payments do not equal one weekly
payment which the man draws out. That is
why it is called "insurance". I mention this
in order to make clear what is meant by
the credit which the man must have in the
fund. The credit must be such as will enable
him to qualify.
Under the provisions of the law as it stood
when the bill was introduced, a man was
entitled to draw seasonal benefits after a
shorter period of employment than that
required under the normal provisions of the
act. For instance, if he had been paying in
for, say, 24 weeks-I am not sure of the
exact qualifying period-although he might
not qualify under the general provisions, he
would be able to qualify for seasonal benefits,
that is, benefits paid in the winter. Under an
amendment adopted this year by the former
parliament, he could qualify for seasonal
benefits, and these would cease on May 17.
Let us say a person draws seasonal benefits
for 15 weeks from early February to the
middle of May. Under the provisions of the

MAY 15, 1958
act, if the time had not expired, that person
would be entitled to draw another five weeks'
benefits. If we amend the act now he will
be able to draw an additional five weeks'
benefits, for the act will continue in force
until the end of June. That is the change
we shall be making. We shall be lengthening
the time in which a person can qualify for
seasonal benefits. That is all very good, and
I think we are all in favour of the principle,
but the thing that bothers me is what is
going to happen to the unemployment insurance fund?
This fund was set up to be on an actuarially sound basis. It is what it says it is, an
insurance fund. When you buy life insurance
you pay a certain premium. A lot of people
pay premiums to the same company, and each
contributor knows what he or his estate is
going to be able to draw. When he dies,
for instance, his estate is going to draw a
certain amount of money because he has
paid certain premiums. Under that scheme
no one has an advantage over anyone else.
But in this case we are changing the basis of
the unemployment insurance fund, and now
workers are going to draw from the fund
to such an extent that I am wondering how
long it will remain actuarially sound.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: May I ask the honourable Leader of the Opposition (Hon. Mr.
Macdonald) a question? Is it not a fact
that thousands of contributors to the fund
have never drawn a cent from it and never
will? I could name thousands of cases like
that.

Honourable senators, I am in favour of
paying unemployment insurance benefits to
these pople who are out of work, but I
don't think it should be done under this act.
I think it should be done under the bill that
was passed in December of last year.
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Oi±awa West): The Unemployment Assistance Act.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Yes, under which
a province notifies the federal Government
when a certain percentage of workers in the
province are unemployed. Why couldn't that
act be brought into effect now for the benefit
of these people? You may say the rate of
payment is not high enough.
Hon. Mr. Quinn: Would it not amount to
the same thing except that it would come
under an act of another name?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: No, for then you
would not be depleting this insurance fund
which so many of our citizens have paid into.
Hon. Mr. Quinn: It fluctuates anyway. It
goes up and down.

Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Yes, but let it go up
and down in the natural way. What is proposed under this bill is to take money from
it against the advice, I am sure, of the
actuaries. My proposal would be that the
money should be paid to these people under
the provisions of the Unemployment Assistance Act at the same rate that benefits would
be paid under the Unemployment Insurance
Act. If that were done every employee and
employer now paying into the unemrployment

Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I don't say my figures

That is what is meant by unemployment insurance. There is no insurance coverage if

would not be insurance at all.
Hon. Mr. Bruni: The employee is not paying it in himself.

as I am sure he will, that this fund is being
unduly depleted and is likely, if the practice
continues for another year, to become actuarially unsound, let the Government take one
of the two courses I have mentioned. I think
it is only fair to the workers and to the
employers of this country who have contributed, that their unemployment fund
should be amply protected.

cleared up. I am quite sure the honourable
senator who made the explanation did not
mean to say, as was implied, that each one

amount for withdrawal. Every one who gets
insurance benefits draws from a general fund,
to which he contributes a premium, and of
course it is not a withdrawal of just his own
funds: otherwise it would be savings, not
insurance.
In making reference to this bill, I have a
couple of points in mind. In the first place,
the need is very strong throughout Canada,
as we all can see, for a very close and careful
administration of the unemployment insurance
fund. Seasonal unemployment insurance is
comparatively new. We have had more experience with unemployment insurance generally, for it has been administered for a
considerable time. But matters that need correction have been creeping into the administration. It is a fact, and it is only natural,
that under certain circumstances and in some
localities here and there a laxity in passing
claims has gradually developed whereby
people have accepted insurance benefits when
they should have sought out and obtained
other employment. There needs to be very
careful administration, and a far more precise
handling and checking of individual cases
than has been in evidence in the past. In such
widespread operations I understand the administration bas to grow and mature.
One point I should like to raise in connection with seasonal unemployment insurance has regard to the dates of operation.
First it came into effect from January 1 to
April 15; then it was extended to the period
of December 1 to May 15; and now, temporarily at least, it will date from December
1 to June 28. These periods are uniform right
across the board throughout Canada for all
classes of trade, without respect to the nature
of the industry. I think that is wrong. I
realize that the difficulty of administration
over varying periods is very great. With these
varying periods, I would not expect individual cases of inequality to be corrected immediately, but the department should be very
alive to conditions and watch for opportunities to see that the periods of insurance
meet the needs and circumstances of each
individual trade as far as possible. I will
give an example.
In connection with the provisions of the
Unemployment Insurance Act with respect
to fishermen, there is only the winter and
spring period during which insurance can
be effective. It will follow now, by this extension, temporarily into early summer. But,
honourable senators, there are places where
the fishery is at its best for the year only

in the winter season. There are other places
where one can get more prolific catches in
the summer. I know this matter has been
discussed between fishermen's delegations,
representatives of trade, the Department of
Labour, and so on, but up to the present
time there has been no solution and no policy
has been brought out to meet those special
conditions. I have actual knowledge of plants
that were erected and big capital invested
to take the fish in areas which are largely
winter fishing areas, and I know of two or
three instances where by reason of the unemployment insurance being effective only
in the period of more prolific fishing the
tendency of the fishermen is to lessen their
operations at that time, and as a result these
plants have to meet very difficult conditions.
These are circumstances which have to be
taken into account, and I do hope that before
too long, as experience can be gathered, it
will be possible to adjust these periods to
meet the special and natural circumstances
of these localities.
One other matter that I might mention
has particular reference to my province of
Newfoundland. The administration of the
unemployment insurance fund, which I say
is a trust fund, calls for very close supervision, for administration that is precise and
exacting. In Newfoundland there is an Unemployment Insurance Commission office at
St. John's and staff are employed at various
places, yet when anything crops up which
is not routine-and matters are from day to
day arising which do not conform to precise
patterns and which call for adjustment-it
has to be referred to a regional office in
Moncton. This causes unnecessary delays in
settling matters and often results in misunderstandings. I think that in the interest
of good administration a regional office should
be set up in Newfoundland to expedite matters. It is only fair to the people who are
contributing to this fund, and advisable for
the administration of the fund generally, that
a close on-the-spot regional and overall
supervision should be given under proper
management right in the province of
Newfoundland.
Hon. Thomas Reid: Honourable senators, I
rise to ask a question from the sponsor of
the bill, but before doing so may I say that
I support the views expressed by the Leader
of the Opposition (Hon. Mr. Macdonald) when
he pointed out the danger that might arise
from depletion of this fund. It is noted that
$72 million was paid out of this fund in the
month of March of this year and that there
is now left in the fund some $740 million. It
would be interesting to know what was in
the fund a year ago.

SENATE
Hon. Mr. Golding: $900 million.
Hon. Mr. Reid: That danger of depletion
could arise in being all too ready to take
moneys from this fund which should comeand on this also I agree with the Leader of
the Opposition-from the consolidated revenue fund.
The Unemployment Insurance Act was
passed in 1940 by a previous administration.
Supplementary benefits came into effect in
1950.
My question, honourable senators, bas to
do with the proposed section 52, which provides for one seasonal benefit period. If we
pass this bill will that become part of the
original Unemployment Insurance Act?
Hon. Mr. Bruni: No, it will net.
Hon. Mr. Reid: Is there a limited time? Is
it just temporary? There is nothing in the
bill to say it is temporary. The legislation
that was passed in 1957 made certain changes
that were carried through this year to May
17; now we are extending the period to June
28 of this year. I am wondering if when this
bill is passed those changes will become part
of the original Unemployment Insurance Act.
That is not made clear in the bill.
Hon. Mr. Bruni: Honourable senators, I
beg to refer the honourable senator to clause
1 of the bill, which reads:
1. During the period commencing on the 18th
day of May, 1958 and ending on the 28th day of
June, 1958, both days inclusive, sections 50, 51 and
52 of the Unemployment Insurance Act shall be
deemed to read as follows: . . .

For that period of time the sections as
set out in the bill will be in operation, but
after the 28th day of June 1958 the sections
will read as set out in the original act.
Hon. Mr. Golding: That is right.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: May I ask the honourable gentleman who explained the bill (Hon.
Mr. Brunt) whether any actuarial reports
have been made with respect to this payment? He told us that $14 million would be
paid out as a result of this extension, which
will be the second extension of seasonal benefit periods. What was the amount paid out
under the former extension? Is that figure
available?
Hon. Mr. Bruni: The only figures available
to me were contained in the statement made
in the other place by the Minister of Labour,
at page 85 of the Commons Hansard. With
the permission of the house, I will quote what
he said:
I would like to note that in the five months
beginning December 1, 1957, and I think this will
answer a question asked in the house earlier,
almost $230 million were paid out in unemployment
insurance benefnts but in spite of these heavy

expenditures the unemployment insurance fund
had at the end of March a remarkably healthy
balance of more than $740 million.

Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Of course it is obvious.
is it not, as the Leader of the Opposition
(Hon. Mr. Macdonald) has stated, that that
$740 million is a credit owned and justly
held for those who in the past have contributed to the fund. It is for the purpose of
satisfying the general conditions of the act,
and it is not a very large sum when one
considers what may take place. One has
only to look back to the hungry thirties, for
instance, and remember the numbers of men
who were unemployed at that time, to realize
the calls that may be made on this fund, and
that $740 million could very soon melt away.
That sum is owned by, is due to and is the
right of those who have contributed to the
fund.
Now we are asked to give additional
benefits to other persons. The figure that my
honourable friend has stated does not give
me any information at all as to how much the
other extension has already eaten up of this
fund. He has told me that $14 million would
be expended under this proposed extension.
Can my friend give me any further figure?
Hon. Mr. Bruni: No, those are all the figures
I have available.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: And there is no statement, other than this very loose remark of
the minister in the other house, with respect
to the effect upon the fund?
Hon. Mr. Bruni: I would not say that. I do
not know what statements were made in the
House of Commons this afternoon when the
bill was being considered there, because
today's Hansard of that house is not yet
available.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Do you not think when
we are being asked to pass a bill of this
kind that a full financial statement should be
put before us?
I have a further question. What is the
necessity for this extension at this time?
Spring is net delayed. What is the economic
reason that the Government puts forward as
to why we should make this extension now?
Hon. John J. Connolly (Ottawa West): Before the honourable senator answers that
question, I wonder if I may heap a few more
coals on his head. I do not mean it in that
spirit, because I think he has done very well
with his explanation of this legislation. Although he has had a somewhat gruelling
session tonight, he has handled himself
extremely creditably.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): 1 do

ta the speed with which this material has

in the bill ta the act which. is actually being

is R.S.C. Chapter 273, and section 50 of that

explanatory notes ta this bill. I know if I

reads as follows:

SENATE
about this bill, some of the explanations
have not satisfied me. If royal assent is not
to be given tonight, why can we not let
third reading stand over until tomorrow? I
do not think it is quite fair to ask the
honourable senator from Hanover (Hon. Mr.
Brunt) to attempt to get all this information,
but I think it should be supplied to us. However, I would not hold up the bill, if it is
proposed to give royal assent tonight.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: May I say, honourable
senators, that another bill is to come to us
shortly, providing for the furnishing of more
money under the National Housing Act.
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): Lots of
money!
Hon. Mr. Asel±ine: The Government
wishes to have the Unemployment Insurance
Bill, the appropriation bill we passed this
morning, and the housing measure receive
royal assent at the same time. I think it is
now proposed that royal assent be had at
5.45 tomorrow afternoon. It seems unlikely
that the housing measure will get to us for
first reading tonight.
I propose, honourable senators, to move
that we adjourn until tomorrow morning
and have the full day to consider the housing measure. I have no objection to third
reading of the bill now before us being
postponed until we meet tomorrow.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Third reading tomorrow.
Mr. Aselline: May I ask the honourable
Leader of the Opposition (Hon. Mr. Macdonald) whether in his opinion we could deal
with and finish the National Housing Act
Amendment bill if we were to adjourn until
three o'clock tomorrow afternoon? The other
chamber will sit tomorrow morning, and
there is a possibility that the bill will not be
here by eleven o'clock.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I should like to see
the housing bill before I gave an opinion as
to how long it may take to pass it through

this house. When I came here this evening
I had not seen this bill for extension of seasonal benefit periods under the Unemployment Insurance Act, and I am rather astonished that we have put it through as quickly
as we have. Probably we shall know more
about the housing bill than we knew about
the bill now before us. Would the honourable
Leader of the Government (Hon. Mr.
Aseltine) think it wise, unless it will cause
some inconvenience, to have this house assemble at, say, twelve noon tomorrow? By
that time we should have some idea as to
when we could expect the housing bill. I
might point out to the honourable Leader of
the Government that a number of questions
were asked this evening about the Unemployment Insurance Bill, and these, at least,
could be answered at noon tomorrow. I leave
the decision entirely to the honourable
Leader of the Government, and I shall be
pleased to be here when he thinks it advisable
that we should assemble.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: The solicitor for the
Unemployment Insurance Commission bas
been in the gallery during the debate, and he
will do his best to furnish us with the
answers required. We asked him to be present
for that reason. If the honourable Leader of
the Opposition thinks that to meet at twelve
o'clock tomorrow will allow us plenty of
time, I have no objection to an adjournment
to that hour. The amendment which we shall
have to consider is a very simple one, consisting of a few words increasing the amount
of funds available for the completion of
houses now under way and the building of
new ones.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Al these bills are
said to be "simple", but when I look at them
I decide that, if they are, I myself am simple.
Hon. Mr. Bruni: The bill before us was
never a simple one.
The Senate adjourned until tomorrow at
12.00 noon.

UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE BILL
THIRD READING

Hon. W. M. Aseltine moved the third reading of Bill C-9, for the temporary extension
of seasonal benefit periods under the Unemployment Insurance Act.
He said: Honourable senators, on account of
the unavoidable absence of the honourable
senator from Hanover (Hon. Mr. Brunt), who
explained this bill yesterday, I have taken
it upon myself to try to answer some of the
questions asked last evening. In looking into
the subject, I find that the Unemployment
Insurance Act is a rather intricate piece of
legislation, and I have had some difficulty in
preparing the answers. However, I will do
my best to satisfy those honourable senators
who asked the questions.
But first may I say that in discussing
problems in connection with this legislation
we have to keep in mind at all times that
this is insurance. For example, if I insure
my property against loss by fire, I pay
premiums to an insurance company, and if
I have a loss I collect more than I paid in
by way of premiums. The company, in order
to be sure that it will have enough money
to pay my loss, collects hundreds of
57075-4-31

thousands of dollars by way of premiums
from other insured persons who have no
loss.
Hon. Mr. Reid: But if there are a lot of
fires the premium rates are increased.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Yes. The point is that
at the time of my loss I get more than I
paid in. The same principle is involved in
connection with this unemployment insurance. The employee pays in a certain
amount by way of premiums, the employer
pays in a certain amount, and the Government pays in a certain amount. But if circumstances arise whereby the employee is
entitled to start drawing benefits, naturally,
in almost every case except where the party
has been paying in for years, he draws out
much more than he ever paid in. That is
what the honourable Leader of the Opposition (Hon. Mr. Macdonald) said, or what I
understood him to say, last evening.
Before I start to answer questions I should
like to give honourable senators certain
other information. In December 1956 the
unemployment insurance fund reached its
highest point, with $927 million.
Since
March of 1957 this amount has been reduced
by $131 million, which is not a great deal,
everything considered. The average receipts
per month are between $18 million and
$22 million. So, even though benefits to
the extent of $14 million may be given to
these seasonal employees, and although
considerable money has been paid out, the
fund, we hope, will build up during the
summer months until it is almost as large
as it was before these heavy payments had
to be made.
I come now to the questions asked by
some honourable senators yesterday.
One point which seems to bother some of
us is the matter of a claimant's credit in
the fund. In that connection I wish to say
that there are two categories of seasonal
benefit claimants, namely, "A" those who,
while failing to qualify for regular benefits,
have at least 15 contribution weeks since
the end of March prior to the claim, and
"B" those whose regular benefit has ended
since the previous April 15th.
Honourable senators will understand that,
under section 53(3) of the act as passed last
November, a claimant under "A" is entitled
to five weeks' seasonal benefit for every six
contributions. Thus, a claimant with a minimum of 15 contribution weeks is entitled to
13 weeks of seasonal benefit. A claimant
coming under "B" is entitled to seasonal
benefit for the same number of weeks for
which he received regular benefit under his
last claim. In either case a claimant cannot
be paid seasonal benefit beyond the end of

SENATE
the seasonal benefit period, which at the
moment is the 17th day of May, and which
date it is proposed by this bill to extend
until June 28 of this year only.
Therefore, the amount of benefit that a
claimant is entitled to is determined in the
case of "A" by the average of his weekly
contributions, which in turn is related to a
schedule of weekly rates. The weekly rate
is then multiplied by the number of weeks of
entitlement. I want to stress the point that
the premiums paid by the employee, the employer and the Government, and the credit
to the account of the employee in the books
of the Unemployment Insurance Commission
are entirely different things. Thus, if a claimant paid contributions for the minimum of
15 weeks at 60 cents per week and had one
dependent, he would be entitled to a benefit
at the rate of $30 per week for 13 weeks, or
a total of $390. That is the credit that the
honourable senator from Hanover was referring to in his remarks last night. That is
what he meant by "credit" when he was
speaking on the bill at that time.
In the case of "B" the claimant is entitled
to the same rate as he received on his last
claim, which, of course, was based on his
contributions in the same manner as for "A".
Honourable senators, I hope that clears up the
question of what is a credit and what is a
premium, and so on.
In reply to a question asked last night by
the honourable Leader of the Opposition
(Hon. Mr. Macdonald), I wish to say that the
number of persons registered for employment at the local offices of the Unemployment
Insurance Commission on May 1, 1958, was
758,028, which was a decrease of 128,757 from
March 13, when the seasonal high point was
reached. Then in reply to a question asked
by the honourable senator from TorontoTrinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck), I have this to
say, that no actuarial report has been made
on this bill, and therefore I am not able to
deal with it at any great length.
The honourable gentleman also asked a
question with respect to the financial effect
of the extension of seasonal benefits made
last fall. Honourable senators will remember
that in November last benefits of this kind
were set back one month from January 1 to
take in the month of December, and were
extended one month to bring them up to the
present time. The only financial effect of the
extension made last fall, ascertainable at this
time, is the amount of seasonal benefit paid
in December 1958, namely, $2,849,480.
Hon. Mr. Golding: That is not for December 1958.

Hon. Mr. Aseltine: I should have said
December 1957. I thank my honourable friend
for the correction.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Would the honourable
gentleman kindly repeat the amount?
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: $2,849,480. Figures for
the month of May will not be obtainable
until perhaps a month or more from now.
Another question I wish to answer as follows: It is estimated that the number of
persons who will benefit from the proposed
extension will be 200,000, and that will cost
approximately $14 million.
These estimates were arrived at by the
Unemployment Insurance Commission in the
following manner, that is to say: Seasonal
benefit claimants on claim at April 30, 1958,
as per reports of the local offices of the
commission, not the Department of Labour,
were 226,000. The number that will drop off
between May 1 and May 15, on account of
finding work, and so forth, will be 25,000,
leaving 201,000, which figure will be further
reduced at the rate of 32,000 per week by
June 28. I have this additional information
in that connection, that the average weekly
rate of benefit for seasonal claimants is $20.
The honourable senator from TorontoTrinity asked a further question, and I say
this in my attempt to answer him: The
proposed extension will meet a special situation that it is believed and hoped will not
recur. It is hoped by the time the period of
extension has expired seasonal employees will
have found work and will not have to draw
further on the fund. Unemployment reached
a postwar high during the past winter, and
while there has been marked improvement
in recent weeks there are still some people
on the labour force who require further protection pending their being able to find jobs,
and possibly also pending a further upturn
in economic activity. The extension contained
in this bill will provide the flexibility needed
to meet this particular set of circumstances.
The honourable senator from Ottawa West
(Hon. Mr. Connolly) asked a question concerning the number of persons drawing benefits. The number of persons claiming benefit
on April 30th 1958 was 722,252, which included 226,870 persons on seasonal benefit.
Seasonal benefit claimants represent 31 per
cent of the total claimants as at April 30,
1958.
I went through the Hansard for last night's
sitting as carefully as possible, and these are
the answers I have obtained to the questions
which were asked. I hope that they will
satisfy the honourable senators who asked
the questions, and that the bill will now be
given third reading.

MAY 16, 1958
Han. Arthur W. Roebuck: Honourable senators, I must certainly compliment the Leader
of the Government (Hon. Mr. Aseitine) upon
answering these questions in a comprehensive
and clear manner. I understand him to say
that at the peak, wbich was on March 13
iast, there were 758,000 claimants against the
fund, and that since then there bas been a decrease of 128,000. So there are now, according
to the latest figures, 630,000 persons claiming
and receiving benefits from the insurance
fund.
Hon. Donald Cameron: Honourabie senators, I would like to make one or two observations in connection with this bill, but
first of ail may I say that I do nat want
any of my remarks considered as critical
of the present Leader of the Government
(Hon. Mr. Aseltine), because 1 think he bas
made an excellent presentation.
However, I tbink that a mucb more appropriate name for the bill would be "A
partial and temporary Unemployment Relief
Act," because that is, in effect, what it is.
My real concern in connection with this
bill, however, and ail extensions of this kind
-and I know a good many others feel the
same way-is that there are creeping into our
welfare legislation a tremendous number of
abuses. Every member in this bouse knows
of the abuses tbat exîst. While no one wisbes
to deny the benefits of welf are legisiation,
and particularly unemployment insurance, to
needy and deserving people, I think that one
of tbe things this bouse might very well
do at a later time is to consider tbe possibility
of setting up a committee to investigate the
abuses of welfare legislation, and the best
place to start would probably be in this field
of unemployment insurance. I am flot prepared at present to move a resolution ta that
end, but if fia one else does it 1 would like
to bring in a motion later on, when I could
document some of my submissions.
The second matter wbich gives me concern
is something not related ta this particular
bill but which is of concern to the Senate,
and that is that there is an increasing tendency, beginning with the Twenty-Third Parliament, to bring bis before the Senate with
the request that tbey be given three readings
in the same sitting. Now, there are occasions
when this is desirable and necessary, and I
am sure that in those cases honourable
senators will be glad ta expedite passage of
the legislation.
However, it will be recalled that an January 7, 1958, the Senate canvened at 8 o'clock
in the evening. Prayers were over at 8.10, and
the first item of business was the reading of
a letter by the Speaker from the Secretary to
the Governor General ta the effect that Mr.

Justice Taschereau, as Deputy of His Excellency the Governor General, would appear in
the Senate to give Royal Assent to a number
of bills at 9.45 that evening. One of those
bills was a supply bill for $272 million. It
duly came in and was given three readings.
On January 9, 'Bill 243, a bill dealing with
the Beechwood Power Project, was braught
in with the request that it be given tbree
readings that evening. This request was not
agreed to by the Senate and consideration of
the bill was carried over.
Then yesterday we had another supply bill,
which was given three readings. We also had
this bill C-9, which we are at present discussing; and I understand, Mr. Leader, that
we are to receive another bill thîs afternoon.
Well, honourable senatars, one of the functions of the Senate as envisaged by the
Fathers of Confederation was that this bouse
should bave the responsibility of taking a
saber second look at ail legisiation. I submit
ta bonourable members that this cannat be
done if bis are ta came in bere and receive
tbree readings at one sitting.
The point of my remarks is simply that I
hope this tendency will not continue, and
tbat the Leader of the Gavernment (Hon. Mr.
Aseltine) in bis new capacity, not as a member of the cabinet-and 1 think be is in a
mare independent position because he is not
a member of the cabinet-should take a stand
and say tbat oniy in the most unusual circumstances will tbis practice be resorted ta.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: We bave the same right
ta Say tbat as be bas.
Hon. John J. Connolly (Ottawa West):
Honourabie senatars, like the honourable
gentleman from. Toronto-Trinity (Han. Mr.
Roebuck) I wish ta thank the Leader of the
Government (Hon. Mr. Aseltine) for the
very camprebensive way in wbicb he bas
answered tbe questions whîch were put ta
him and ta tbe honourabie senator from
Hanover (Hon. Mr. Brunt) last evening.
In following the remarks that bave been
made by the bonaurabie gentleman from
Banff (Hon. Mr. Cameron), I think it only
fair ta the Senate to say this, that the circumstances of the introductian of this bill
are very unusual. There is an emergency.
The Government bas told us tbat there is
an emergency and in such circumstances we
are ail glad ta act as expeditiously as we can.
But we are in a somewhat difficuit position,
and in a sense, tao, the narmal parlîamentary
practice bas had ta be laid aside. The
normal practice is that after the Speech from.
the Throne is read a bill is introduced ta indicate the independence of Parliament, and
then, before any measures are actively discussed and passed, consideration of the

SENATE
gracious speech is the first and the only order
of business. There is some sense to that,
and I think perhaps the circumstances in
which we find ourselves today illustrate the
point.
This bill involves many interesting principles to which the Senate, as the second
chamber, might well give serious consideration. While we have appointed our standing
committees, none of them have met, and
until they meet we are not in a position to
be able to establish quorums, for the quorums
must be approved by the house. So, the bill
which we discussed last evening and are
discussing here today could not possibly go to
a standing committee. It speaks very well
for the forbearance of his Honour the
Speaker, the Leader of the Government and
for all honourable senators that we have
abridged our rules to the extent of allowing
the discussion to go on for the benefit of
getting the information we felt we needed.
But I think the view as to the unusual
circumstances in which the Senate finds itself
in connection with this legislation should be
placed on the record. I am not complaining
about the situation; I am simply stating it
to be a fact. Too often we in the Senate
are criticized for putting legislation through
in a purely formal way, simply because we
are asked to do it; and while we do not have
a rule of closure in this house, in effect
closure is applied to us when a deadline is
set by means of an announcement that there
will be a royal assent at a certain hour.
I should now like to come to the bill in
question for just a moment. The Leader of
the Government was good enough to say
that some 31 per cent of the total names on
the rolls at the employment offices in the
country conceivably could benefit from this
legislation. This is rather a major gesture
towards the serious unemployment situation
in the country, which the honourable leader
has acknowledged and described. Thirtyone per cent is almost a third of the number
of unemployed persons, and that number is
larger than it has been at any previous time
since the war. If this is an attempt to make
a major attack upon the problem of
unemployment, I think the Senate, not in
any partisan or political sense, might well
consider whether, in view of the discussion
that went on last evening, the moneys that
are required to provide this assistance
should come from a fund which was
originally set up for different reasons and
with different terms of reference. This is
not the first time that the rules have been
changed after the game began. Last year

a special arrangement was made in connection with seasonal benefits, and the payment made was taken out of the unemployment insurance fund. Now there is to be a
further resort to the fund to the extent of
$14 million.
I admit the fund is a large one, but it
was established as a trust fund for a specific
purpose. True, the contributors to it are
not only the employed people of the country,
but employers also contribute, and so does
the Government. But if unemployment is
a national emergency today, it seems to me
that it would be a more valid principle of
public accounting to resort to the general
revenues of the country to attack that
problem than to take the money from this
special fund.
There is another facet to it. It is this:
If the relief to the extent of $14 million
comes from the unemployment insurance
fund, relief is being provided by a special
number of citizens and not by the country
as a whole. We could not, of course, in the
time available and with the machinery we
have at this particular stage of the session,
ask that this type of principle be reviewed
by a committee, because the facilities are
not available.
I do not for a moment suggest that the
legislation should be held up because of this
circumstance, but I think that we might
some time look at a similar bill, and perhaps even at this bill in review, to see
whether or not the proper principles of
public accounting have been followed, and
whether as an alternative the Government
might not have taken the money from the
consolidated revenue fund-not only for this
extension but for a previous extensionand used the machinery of the Unemployment Insurance Act to distribute it.
Hon. Mr. Hawkins: Could the Leader of
the Government tell me to what extent the
Government participates in providing funds
to the Unemployment Insurance Commission?
Is there a direct contribution, other than the
payment of administrative expenses?
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Yes.
Hon. Mr. Hawkins: What is that amount?
Hon. Mr. Quinn: I think it is one-third.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: My understanding is
that the employee contributes one-third, with
the same proportion being supplied by the
employer and by the Government. If that
is not correct, I will advise the chamber
later.
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): Honourable senators, may I have the indulgence of
the house for a moment to speak to a point
which I overlooked in my general remarks?

made will receive due consideration.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: May I add, let this be
the last call of this nature on the fund.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Honourable senators,
may I be permitted to add that I have just
been handed a memorandum from the solicitor for the commission, in which he states
that the Government pays one-fifth of the
total contributions paid by employees and
employers, and also the cost of administration.
Hon. Mr. Baird: One-fifth of one-half.

BUSINESS OF THE SENATE
Hon. Mr. Aseliine: I believe this completes
the business for the morning. There is a
possibility that the National Housing Bill
will reach us this afternoon. I know the
minister in charge is very anxious that it
shall receive early attention, because the available funds have about run out. Under these
circumstances there is nothing to do but to
adjourn during pleasure, possibly until some
time between three and four o'clock this
afternoon, to meet at the call of the bell.
The Senate adjourned during pleasure.
At 4 p.m. the sitting was resumed.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Honourable senators,
there is still some hope that the National
Housing Bill will be sent over to us in time
to be dealt with today but there is also a
possibility it will not. Al I can suggest
at this time is that we adjourn during
pleasure, to resume at 5.45 p.m. for royal
assent. If the bill should reach the Clerk of

MOTION

FOR SECOND

READING

The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators,
when shall this bill be read the second time?
Hon. W. M. Aseltine: Honourable senators,
it is very important that this bill be passed
by both houses as soon as possible, and the
minister in charge has requested me to use
every effort in that direction. For that reason, therefore, I move that the bill be read
the second time on Monday next at 8 p.m.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Honourable senators,
twenty minutes are at our disposal before
the Deputy to His Excellency the Governor
General is due to arrive, and it occurred to
me that, if the Leader of the Government
(Hon. Mr. Aseltine) is prepared to do so, he
might make a statement on the bill now, and
we could continue with the debate Monday
evening.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: I have no objection, if
that is the will of the chamber.
Hon. Mr. Lamberi: Honourable senators, I
think it would contribute a good deal to the
discussion of the bill later-and if we could
adopt the suggestion offered as a practice
this would be a good time to start-if an
explanatory statement were made on the first
reading of the bill, and discussion on the
principle of the bill left to the second reading
stage, as has always been done in the past.
Hon. Mr. Aselitine: That is not what the
Leader of the Opposition (Hon. Mr. Macdonald) suggested. He suggested that the motion
for second reading be made now and that I
as Leader of the Government make a statement now in support of that motion, and
then he would adjourn the debate. Is that
not what he had in mind?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: My suggestion was
the same as that of my honourable friend the
senior senator from Ottawa (Hon. Mr. Lambert). Second reading of the bill will be

SENATE
moved now, I take it. I suggested that the
Leader of the Government make his statement now, and I understood that the senior
senator from Ottawa agreed.
Hon. Mr. Lamberi: If I might explain; I
had the impression, from the exchange of
remarks between the two leaders, that the
second reading of the bill was to be given
next Monday evening, and not now.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: I would prefer to make
a statement now, on the second reading.
The Hon. the Speaker: Does the honourable
Leader of the Government desire to change
his motion?
Hon. Mr. Aselline: Yes, I withdraw my
motion, and now move that the bill be read
the second time.
Honourable senators, this has been a rather
hectic day for me in trying to arrange
matters. We had thought earlier that this bill
would be read the second time in the Senate
today, and probably passed, but as that is
not possible I propose to speak on the second
reading now, and there will not be sufficient
time for more than that. When I have done
so, I suppose the Leader of the Opposition
will adjourn the debate, and the debate will
continue Monday evening.
In my opinion, this is not a complicated
bill; it merely proposes to amend section 22
of the National Housing Act, 1954, in order to
provide an additional $350 million for house
building. No other amendments whatsoever
are proposed at this time. The section in its
present form permits the Government to
advance up to $400 million to Central Mortgage and Housing Corporation for housing
loans, and this amount has nearly all been
committed for housing loans at different
times. The bill proposes that the limit be
raised from $400 million to $750 million.
The funds provided by this act are used
by the corporation for its various lending
programs. For example, under section 16
to limited
dividend
are made
loans
companies for the construction of low
rental dwellings for elderly people and
Perhaps right now
low income families.
I ought to give a little more information
with regard to that feature of the act. These
projects that I have just referred to are
undertaken by community companies which
build bouses for people who are in the low
income bracket, and the organization to which
the money is loaned is limited to making a
profit of 5 per cent on its investment. The
Central Mortgage and Housing Corporation
approves the rates of rentals and all that
kind of thing. In other words, it is directly
under the corporation's control to make sure
that these limited dividend companies limit
their profit to 5 per cent.

In addition, loans are made to primary producer industries for the contruction of rental
housing for their employees. The corporation
also makes loans to persons in small centres
of population who wish to build homes for
their own occupancy but are unable to obtain a regular insured loan from an approved
lender, such as banks and life insurance companies and others. These lending institutions
do not generally approve of making loans
in villages and small towns where the population is not very large, and because of
that fact the corporation has now been given
power to make these loans.
Honourable senators will recall that last
spring and summer mortgage money was in
short supply, and as a result the pace of
house construction slowed down. This shortage affected particularly families with modest
means who wished to finance the purchase
of homes or were seeking low rental accommodation. Accordingly in the month of August 1957 the Government authorized Central
Mortgage and Housing Corporation itself to
make loans of public funds to fill this gap.
The statutory limit as of that time, under
section 22, was $250 million, of which about
$100 million had already been used or committed, leaving $150 million available for this
purpose.
The corporation arranged for the banks, life
insurance companies and other approved
lenders to act as its agents in dealing with
the public. This is what is known as the
agency arrangement, which was made at the
time between the Government and these lending institutions. In the eight months since
August 1957 during which this agency arrangement bas been in effect more than
26,000 new housing units have been financed
under it, quite apart from those which approved lenders have financed under the National Housing Act with their own funds.
The number of dwellings actually started
under the agency plan numbered 20,675.
I would like to give some information with
respect to that. During the fourth quarter of
1957 the average cost of single family dwellings under this arrangement was quite a bit
less than under insured loans. The cost per
unit was $13,192, which is 13 per cent less
than the average cost of dwellings built with
insured loans outside the agency, during the
same period.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I do not like to interrupt the honourable gentleman, but why is
there a difference between the cost under the
two financing methods?
Hon. Mr. Aselline: If my friend will bear
with me for a moment, I will explain that
later.

MAY 16, 1958
The down payments were one-third lower.
Ail this was done for the purpose of building
single family dwellings a littie more cheaply,
if possible, than those bult under insured
loans outside the agency.
I have some information here which may
answer my honourable friend's question. The
non-agency dwellings on the average at that
time cost $15,146 per unit; houses buiît by
the agency were being buit for $13,192,
which is 13 per cent less. The square frotage
of floor space in the non-agency houses was
1,199 square feet, and the agency houses,
which were a littie smaller, contained 1,048
square feet. The average cost per square foot
for the non-agency houses was $10.38 per
constructed dweiling, and for the agency
bouses $10.23.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Would the construction in the agency houses be flot as good?
Hon. Mr. Aselline: They contain a smailer
square footage of floor space.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: 1 understood the cost
per square foot was less.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: I do flot knOw that I
can explain the difference in cost, but that
is the information I have. The greater saving
wouid of course be in the smailer square
footage in the agency houses.
0f the authorized total of $400 million,
approximately $256 million has been committed under the agency agreement. That was
the purpose of building ail those homes which
I mentioned a few moments ago. Another $59
million has gone to finance individual homes
in smaller centres. These were direct boans
made by the Central Mortgage and Housing
Corporation in smaiier centres, where ordinary lending agencies did not care to make
loans. About $70 million has been used for
iow rentai house building by limited dividend
companies. I gave some information a short
time ago about these limited dividend companies which built houses for the low income
bracket group. The remainder has been used
for rentai housing projects for workers in
primary industries. Somewhere between $7
million and $8 million is on hand or being
used at the present time.
The Government believes that most of the
rnoney for house building should be provided
by private lenders-and I agree with ît-and
it hopes therefore that the added funds wili
finance the corporation's lending programs
for a considerable period. In the past few
months the approved lending institutions
have been iending more actively than for
some time previously. For exampie, during
the first eighteen weeks of this year they
made insured boans for 11,775 units, as against
6,054 units in the same period last year. It

is hoped that residual lendings by the corporation may be reduced; that is, that there
wili be fewer cases of qualified applicants
unable to obtain loans from the funds of
approved lenders. Unless the present statutory imit of $400 million is raised by the
amount requested the corporation will be
obliged to discontinue ail its various direct
lending activities.
This authorization, if it goes into effect,
will make certain funds available for qualified applicants.
Briefiy, honourabie senators, that is an explanation of the bill. It is a very simple
measure, consisting of only a sentence or two,
deaiing with the raising of the limit of $400
million to $750 million.
Hon. Mr. Hawkins: Will the honourable
Leader of the Government tell us what sort
of arrangements are made with the iendîng
agencies he mentioned? Does the corporation
lend the money to these lending agencies, or
do the agencies administer the funds on
behaîf of the corporation?
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: My understanding is
that the lending agencies lend their own
money,
with
a
guarantee
from
the
Government.
Hon. Mr. Hawkins: The information I have
is contained in a dlipping from this morning's
Toronto Globe and Mail, which explains how
the rnoney has been used. Most of the $256
million, it states, has gone into agency boans,
and $59 million in direct boans, as has been
explained.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: I thought the honourable senator was referring to the other
loans which were made before this system
was adopted.
Hon. Mr. Hawkins: No, I am referring to
to what are called agency boans. I was wondering what arrangements were made.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: My brief does not appear
to cover the details of the arrangements
made with these companies, but I assume that
they pay interest for the money.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I understood that
Central Mortgage and Housing Corporation

loans.
Hon, Mr. Aseltine: I wiii obtain definite

On this basis the total agency boan commitments of $260 million would involve processing costs to Central Mortgage and Housing Corporation of approximately $2.6 million,

$2.6 million. As the principal of the loans is
in public funds, the interest yield of course
accrues to the Government to offset these
costs.

GOVERNMENT PUBLICATIONS
DISTRIBUTION TO MEMBERS OF PARLIAMENTQUESTION OF PRIVILEGE

On the Orders of the Day:
Hon. Thomas Reid: Honourable senators, I
rise on a question of privilege affecting
honourable members of Parliament, and particularly the honourable members of this
chamber. Since 1930, when I came to Ottawa
as a member of the House of Commons,
members of Parliament have been sent
various Government publications, and if any
further are required all one has to do is
write the Queen's Printer. After all, we
represent sections of the people in the province from which we come, and I think most
honourable members will agree with me that
to carry out our duties successfully we require certain informative bulletins which are
issued from time to time by the Government.
Of late, when lists have been sent out from
the printing bureau, we have been asked, if
we were interested in any of the publications
listed, to mark the list and send for them. I
had occasion to send for three, one of which,
having to do with fisheries, I particularly
wanted. I have been informed by the Queen's
Printer, and I suppose every other honourable senator has been similarly informed, that
I cannot have these publications unless I pay
for them. Let no one say that I do not want
to pay for them because I happen to have
been born in Scotland. I am raising this
question of privilege entirely on principle. It
may happen that when one of these lists is
received by some honourable senator he may
be absent from home-out of town or perhaps
in hospital. Because one does not put a mark
in front of items on the list, and return it,
is a member of Parliament now to be denied
the bulletins he requires?
I know it may be argued that this practice
But
is adopted for reasons of economy.
how can one be violating the idea of economy
if 500 to 5,000 copies of a certain bulletin
are lying down at the Printing Bureau and
as a member of Parliament-a member of
the Senate or the House of Commons-you
write and ask for a copy? Yet you are told
you must pay for it because you did not
put a little cross opposite the name of the

bulletin on the list of publications a few days
before or after the publication or bulletin
was issued by the Queen's Printer. I am
protesting with all seriousness against this
practice, for I can see the time when we will
perhaps have to take off our hats every time
we go into some of these government offices.
We could in time become mere puppets.
Many of the new honourable senators may
not realize what I am fighting for but, after
all, as senators and members of Parliament
we have a place in this country's affairs and
have certain duties to perform, and we cannot always perform them successfully unless
we have access to some of these bulletins

and publications.
when we might expect to receive a copy of
the Gordon Commission's Report, and the
honourable Leader of the Government (Hon.
Mr. Aseltine) was good enough to send me
his copy. In the meantime I had sent to
the Queen's Printer for a copy of this report
and, lo and behold, I got it on Friday. I
am wondering why they didn't say to me,
"You have no right to have it. You should
pay for it because you didn't mark a cross
before the name of the report when the list
was issued."
Honourable senators, I am placing this
matter before the Leader of the Government
to tell him that the rights of members of
Parliament are being encroached upon. This
is a far more unfair ruling than the one
made last year regarding stationery, for
many of us can get along with little stationery. But it is a different matter when you
come to publications printed by the Queen's
Printer, which contain information that
should be available to us so that we may be
able to pass it on to the people in our ridings or districts. We might get a list and
see some document that we do not wish to
have at the moment, but perhaps three weeks
later someone living in our riding or province
may write and ask a certain question regarding it. Then we write to the Printing Bureau
and are told, not by the Government, but
by an official, that we cannot have it unless
we pay for it. I am protesting as strongly
as I can, and ask if we cannot go back to
the old plan which has existed ever since
I came here, whereby when senators want
a document they can send for it and obtain
it. If a bulletin or document were out of
print, I do not think anyone would protest
and ask for it to be re-printed. I am sure
that if the Printing Bureau said they were
sorry, that a document was out of print,
that explanation would be accepted. But
when there are hundreds and thousands of
copies down there, and they say, "You cannot have it unless you pay for it", I say that
we should not stand for that.

under the provisions of section 22 (1) of the
act. The amount originally provided for this
purpose under the act was $250 million. And
may I say that this original grant was made
by the former administration: indeed, the
bill we are considering tonight is to amend
an act passed by the former administration.

This is not something new being brought
forward by the present administration.
As I say, the original amount was $250
million, which was later increased to $400
million. I understand that with the exception of a small amount, that sum has now
been placed in loans, and for that reason it
is urgent that the bill be passed as soon
as possible so that house building operations
can continue. The bill proposes that the
$400 million already granted be increased
by a further sum of $350 million to be distributed by way of mortgage loans.
Honourable senators, this sum should build
quite a few houses. But it will do more
than build houses: it will create employment
for a lot of people; it will also use a lot of
lumber that is piled up in the lumber yards
throughout the country. These are good objectives, and I am in favour of the bill and

will certainly support it. But I think we
should be aware of the fact that the Government is bringing forward this bill not so much
to alleviate the housing shortage in the coun-

try, as to give employment. I believe that is
the admitted reason for bringing forward the
bill at this time.

Hon. Mr. Quinn: A pretty good reason, too.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: A very good reason.

I was about to say it is a two-edged sword,
but a two-edged sword does damage: rather,

it is the opposite, in that it does good in
two ways. Its effect will be to meet the need
for housing and at the same time to give
employment, and the security to the country
is good.
One phase of the matter that does concern
me is with respect to the advancing of money
for the building of small homes. I sometimes wonder if we are not building too
many small homes in Canada. I would ask
the Leader of the Government to inform the
house, if he can, of the size of houses which
will be built by the new loans. It is quite
all right for a young couple who are just
starting off to have a house consisting of
a livingroom, diningroom, kitchen, a bathroom and one bedroom; but, it is not long
before they need at least two bedrooms. It
seems to me there are too many houses now
being built with only two bedrooms. As I
travel across the country on trains I notice,
particularly on the outskirts of every city

and community, a great many apparently
small houses with not more than two
bedrooms.
Honourable senators, this size of house is
all right if the present and future generations are to be one or two-child familles. But
do you think the Government should encourage the building of so many small homes?
More houses are necessary, but let us not fill
up the country with one- or two-bedroom
residences. Large families are contributing
much to the development of our country. I
believe children have a better chance to
meet successfully the problems of the world
if they have had some competition in their
homes with a number of brothers and sisters.
Although I am going to vote for this bill, I
hope that under it not too many two-bedroom
bouses will be built.
(Translation):
Hon. Cyrille Vaillancouri: Honourable senators, may I be permitted to add a few
words. In Quebec, through our credit unions,
we have had quite a bit of experience in
house building. At the present time our
credit unions have outstanding loans amounting to more than $225,000,000. Our difficuity
is that the low income earner, because he
finds building costs too high, is inclined to
build too small a house. As my leader (Hon.
Mr. Macdonald) said, a five-room house will do
nicely for two people; but for a family, experience has shown that it takes a seven-room
house. Such a house can rarely be built for
less than $11,000, unless you join a housing
co-operative, when it is possible to reduce
substantially the cost of the land and of
construction. But co-operatives are not possible everywhere. They are practically impossible in some centres. Mind you, I am
not criticizing the act; on the contrary, I
approve of it, but it might possibly be
improved. To prove that I am in favour of
the act, I would like to refer to my 1957-1958
annual report for the Fédération des Caisses
populaires Desjardins. This is what I had to
say:
We believe that one of the best ways of solving
the unemployment problem is to promote as far
as possible the building of private homes and to
facilitate ownership. The construction of buildings
and bouses opens up a market for lumber and for
ail the materials that go into construction, for ail
the accessories which make a home more pleasant
and more comfortable, such as refrigerators, electric stoves and washing machines, etc., and finally,
for the furnishings of a home.

Building is the industry which needs the
most varied types of workers and which gives
the whole country the most stable employment. Moreover, house building spreads employment over the whole country while, in
the case of large public works, employment

MAY 19, 1958
is restricted to one locality. The act was
passed in 1954 under the former Government
and due credit should be given to it for this
initiative. The present Government wants
to pursue this wise course. This act is a
social security measure. What the population
needs most in the way of social security-I
have repeated it many times-is family security, a roof over the family's head. And
when a man buys a piece of land to build
himself a house, and thus becomes an owner,
that little piece of his native land becomes
all his own, and his love for his country
grows deeper. At present, the main problem is that building costs are too high for
the wage earner in the $3,500 bracket. According to the latest statistics, the average
family income is barely more than that. In
the case of a loan for a $10,000 house repayable in 25 years, at 6 per cent interest,
repayment is at the rate of $64 a month,
plus insurance, maintenance and taxes, which
add another $20 at least, or a total of $84
a month. Well, the man who earns only $70
a week can hardly pay $84 per month. That
is the problem. The Quebec Government allows the owner of a new home costing up to
$8,000 a rebate on the interest charges
amounting to 3 per cent of the amount of
the loan. Thanks to this financial help, the
wage earner in the $3,500-$3,800 bracket can
manage to balance his budget. Economists
say, and experience has shown, that you
should not spend on housing per month more
than you earn in one week. In our credit
union housing loans, we provide for the continuity of the loan, so that even if the head
of the family passes on, the family need not
lose its home overnight. In the event of
death, the balance of the loan is paid by
the insurance. Some may think that this
2 or 3 per cent interest payment may be too
heavy a charge on the Government. In theory,
it may represent a little over $2,000 for an
$8,000 loan. But statistics show that nearly
25 per cent of the beneficiaries of 25-year
loans die before complete repayment. In
those cases the insurance takes over and there
is no more interest to be paid or guarantee to
be given. The premium for this type of
insurance comes to 5 cents per month per
$100, but it is reduced with every $100 repaid.
Thus, people of small means are enabled
to have their own home. I make these few
suggestions for the benefit of the proper
authorities. Larger corporations refuse to
venture in the smaller centres, where the
insurance companies have no inspectors. They

want to lend where they can easily look after
their investment. The Credit Unions, on the
other hand, cover about all types of centres.
We have granted loans to people in the Magdalen Islands, and we have had no trouble.
Repayments are being made there as well
as, if not better than, elsewhere, for as we
have local branches there, supervision is
greatly facilitated. As I said a few moments
ago, we have developed this lending system.
Credit Unions have over $225 million in outstanding loans, and they have loaned a total
of one billion dollars in the last 25 years.
If we have succeeded, it is because we have
discarded the system of repayments on a
yearly basis, which did not work out very
well, in favour of a monthly repayment plan.
It is the most economical and social way to
help our lower income groups to buy their
own home and to ensure their happiness.

Hon. Thomas Reid: When the honourable
Leader of the Government (Hon. Mr. Aseltine)
speaks, will he answer two questions in
addition to those which have already been
propounded to him? Before putting those
questions, may I say that although in principle the bill before us is the same as that
which was introduced by the previous Government, it would seem to embody certain
changes of policy. I noticed that when, this
year, the minister was explaining this bill in
the other place, he pointed out that stress is
placed on the loaning of money for the building of homes, and that a prime purpose of
the bill is to provide employment and work,
-objects with which all of us are in agreement. But I would like to know why there
seems to be discrimination now against the
building of properties consisting of apartments which would be available for rent to
persons who, for one reason or other, may
have been forced to sell their homes. I have
in mind particularly people up in years who,
owing to higher assessments and increased
municipal taxes, find it now almost impossible
to carry on their old homes and are looking
for apartments to rent. I know that in the
district from which I come rental homes for
the aged are becoming extremely common.
At this point I would like to correct a statement made by a C.C.F. member in the other
house who, repeating a statement made years
ago when wartime bouses were being built,
said that these houses would one day bring
about slum conditions. I have always maintained that that view was entirely wrong.

SENATE
It is not buildings which bring about slum
conditions, it is people.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Reid: I would like to show some
of the C.C.F. members these housing projects
which some years ago they predicted would
be slum areas. They are now beautifully
landscaped with flower gardens, green grass
and trees growing all around. But the
C.C.F.ers still point their fingers at these
newly proposed projects today and claim that
they will become slum areas. They are always
looking at the wrong side of a picture. I just
could not help making this comment at this
time.
I am just wondering, though, about the
matter of discrimination. If the object of
this legislation is to encourage employment,
then I am sure we are all for it. But why
discriminate now against rentals? I know
nothing much has been done by municipalities to take advantage of the housing situation, for many municipalities are almost
broke. The provincial Government of British
Columbia, following similar action taken by
the provincial Government of Alberta, has
compelled its municipalities to increase taxation to 60 per cent of the previous year's
selling value. The provincial Government has
loaded this financial responsibility on the
municipalities, and it has done this to save
itself from paying out certain revenues. The
result has been that many people have decided to sell their homes and move into
rental accommodation. I can vouch for this
fact because many people have come to me
and said: "Tom, we are going to sell. We
can't pay the taxes any longer. We are looking for a place to rent." New rental accommodation is in great demand and is popular
with couples, particularly older folks who
receive a total of $110 a month in old age
pension. They find they can just about get by.
The second point I wanted to raise has to
do with interest rates. If interest rates have
been reduced generally by banks and other
lending institutions why is the Government
now charging 6 per cent on its housing loans?
That may not sound like a large interest rate
to some, but you must bear in mind that if
a person, after making his down payment,
has a mortgage of $10,000 on his home, he
will have to pay $50 a month in interest
alone. Of course, this amount will decrease
gradually throughout the amortization period,
but at the beginning of the loan term a
greater percentage of the payments will apply
on the interest. I differ somewhat with those
who claim it is going to save us from communism if we enable our people to own their
own homes under Central Mortgage and
Housing Corporation. I wonder if they really

see the picture clearly today? There was a
time when ambitious industrial workers and
others, through their own efforts and unassisted by Government legislation, were
eventually able to acquire their own homes.
That sort of thing was not uncommon, but
today we have become a great state institution for building houses. God help this
country if a recession ever takes place.
Despite all the millions of dollars Canada has
paid out on housing, no Government would
ever dare foreclose on the people who live
in these houses. Some people talk about the
wonderful independence a person has when
he owns his own home. It is true that these
people are getting homes, but some of the
bouses I have seen may have to be rebuilt
in 30 years' time. They will not last like the
old-time houses have. I say this without fear
of successful contradiction, for I have examined many of them.
Honourable senators, in closing I want to
say that I am particularly interested in those
two questions: why is the Government, in
amending the legislation, frowning on rentals,
and why is it still charging 6 per cent interest
on housing loans?
Hon. G. Percival Burchill: Honourable
senators, I want to make just a few brief
comments on this legislation. Every member
of this chamber must be fully conscious of
what the National Housing Act bas meant for
Canada, the construction of thousands of
homes for our people. I am sure there is not
a town or city from the Atlantic to the
Pacifie which has not shared in the benefits
of this legislation. However, great as those
advantages have been, there is a considerable
segment of our population which has not
shared in them. I refer to the low income
workers-particularly those in my section of
Canada-who are as anxious today as they
have been for many years to find some means
of buying a home. I am sure that every
honourable senator from the Maritime provinces would recognize these people and would
agree with me that they have not the necessary cash to acquire a house of the type and
description which have been built in large
numbers throughout Canada in the past few
years. They would like a bouse such as was
described by the honourable Leader of the
Government (Hon. Mr. Aseltine); they would
be satisfied to move into an unfinished threebedroom house which they could complete
themselves to specifications laid down by
Central Mortgage and Housing Corporation.
I would consider that such a bouse would not
cost more than $6,000.
I suppose to honourable senators who come
from rich urban centres $6,000 would seem to
be a very small amount to put into a house.

MAY 19, 1958
But in aur section of the country we have
been working on plans, which we hope will
be accepted by C.M.H.C., whereby partially
finished three-bedroomn homes, equipped with
ail the necessaries for family living, will be
made available to, low incarne workers on the
understanding that they will finish themn to
specification as time goes an.
It would be surprising, too, honourable
senators, to know the interest which such
a proposition has commanded in many sections of the Maritime provinces, and the
number of demands and inquiries as ta how
these people can be accommodated. The
plans have been approved by the central
office but had ta corne here ta Ottawa for
final approval, and it is my hope that that
approval will be given. My only purpose
in rising is ta say that I do hope some of the
funds which will be made available under
this legisiation will be earmarked ta take
care af those low incarne people who compose a large section of the population who
want bouses in my part of Canada.
Hon. Wisharf McL. Robertson: Honourable
senators, I have no particular comments ta
make on the bill, in support of it, but I
would ask the honourable leader (Hon. Mr.
Aseltine) if hie has any information as ta
comparative casts of building, and also if
the Government has any expectation that
between the time this money is provided and
used private industry and the loan companies wiil corne in and suppiy capital in
greater quantities so that the Government
will not find it necessary ta do sa? It seems
ta me that 6 per cent on a government
guaranteed loan is a very favourable return.
As far as I know, the boan companies have
a plethora of money, and it is difficuit for
me ta understand why the Governmnent has
ta provide money at s0 high a rate o! interest
when there are, I should think, such favourable circumstances for loaning.

the number of housing units completed from
1935 ta 1957.
Those years, perhaps, are
rather significant in a politicai way, but I
do not refer ta it for that reason. 1 do so
only because that is the way the figures are
given in the booklet. I think it is warth
while taking note o! the fact that in those
years 422,344 hausing units were completed
under the various housing acts-and there
were three o! them-but there were 1,161,374
units completed by financing which was
not provided under the housing acts. In
other words, three times as many housing
units were completed by what presumably
would be private money than by money
provided through these various housing acts.
Hon. Mr. Vaillancouri: Caisses populaires?
Han. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): Caisses
populaires may be a good example, and a!
course the other normal lending agencies,
insurance campanies, private funds from administrators of estates, and so on.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: May I ask the hanourable gentleman if these boans were nat guaranteed by Central Mortgage and Hausing
Corporation?
Hon. Mr. Cannolly (Ottawa West): That is
not the way I read it. I think these statistics
show the number of houses campleted under
the variaus housing acts, in one column, and
the number o! housing units completed by
money supplied by private agencies, in
another column.
Several honourable senators have referred

raised to 61% per cent, but the bond rate under
the act as of May 1 was 4 per cent; the rate to
be taken into account.

It seems to me that when the original rate
for loans under the National Housing Act was
set about a year or more ago, it was set in
relation to long-term Government bonds, and
I understand that the prices and the yields
on those bonds have fallen in late months
rather appreciably. I would like to put this
question to the Leader of the Government
(Hon. Mr. Aseltine): Has the formula under
which the interest rate has been set for
these loans changed in any material way? Six
per cent does seem to be a rather high rate,
because the cost of money is falling, and
generally long term Government bond rates
and yields are falling. I do not ask the
honourable leader to try to get the information tonight, but perhaps he could have it
at our next sitting.

I would just like to say that I have a very
great appreciation of the work done by
Central Mortgage and Housing Corporation.
I know it does not always function in every
way as everyone of us would wish, but that is
of course understandable-it cannot please
everybody, it cannot meet every contingency.
But on the whole I think it is very well
handled, as far as one can see. I do hope,
though, that in the province of Newfoundland
its operations will become more extended. I
think that is also the hope of residents of other
provinces, the smaller provinces particularly.
In Newfoundland the greater part of the
corporation's activity is in St. John's and
the St. John's area. There is a very great
need for more assistance of that nature for

making loans in very remote places, but there
are numerous places I am sure where these
facilities could be granted. I hope it won't
be long before they will be extended so they
will be of greater general benefit to our
people than at present.
Hon. Norman P. Lamberi: Honourable
senators, reference has been made already to
the two reports of Central Mortgage and
Housing Corporation which have corne to us
today in the mail, and I naturally wonder if
it is the intention of my honourable friend
the Leader of the Government (Hon. Mr.
Aseltine) to table these reports, in keeping
with the requirement of the Central Mortgage
and Housing Corporation Act that the annual
report and accounts be tabled within fourteen
days of their receipt by the minister. That
being the requirement, would it not be in
order to suggest that this whole question be
referred to the appropriate standing committee of this house to inquire further into
the corporation's financial statements and the
need for additional housing under the supervision, at least, or the guarantee, of the
corporation? The annual report shows on its
balance sheet assets of $733 million, with a
corresponding amount on the liability side.
From year to year since 1945 additional
undertakings have been made by Central
Mortgage and Housing Corporation and carried through to meet the demands of the
times. One has often wondered just what the
financial position is with respect to the
mortgages and how many of them are beginning to get to the point where they should be
paid off, or what the liability is in connection
with them.

Hon. Calvert C. Pratt: Honourable senators,
just to assist in clarifying one or two points, I
have been looking through the books that
were referred to a moment ago by the
honourable senator from Ottawa West (Hon.
Mr. Connolly) sent to us by Central Mortgage
and Housing Corporation. A question was
asked concerning the relative costs of construction. On page 40 in the booklet Canadian
Housing Statistics it is shown that in 1954I take that year as an example-the average
construction cost per square foot of single
family dwellings financed under the National
Housing Act was $9.61; and that cost figure
rose to $10.48 per square foot in 1957, an increase of about 9 per cent. Comparing the
figures for 1955 and those for 1957, we see
the increase shown in that interval is about
7 per cent.
A point was raised by my honourable
friend from New Westminster (Hon. Mr.
Reid) with reference to the interest rate
being charged by the corporation on loans.
I notice in the annual report for 1957 the
corporation shows interest earned under the
housing acts to a total of $16,674,426, which
left a net income transferred to reserve account-after paying all expenses, deduction
for interest on borrowings and so forth-of
$1,017,512. That figure is arrived at after a
deduction for estimated income tax of $970,000. I just do not know why a corporation,
acting in a capacity such as this, being a
public body, is obliged to take into its costs,
and therefore provide in its interest charges,
an amount for income tax. It may be because
of a desire not to discourage other interests
engaged in this business, and if so, that may
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: I have that information.
be a very proper reason. But anyhow, there
Hon. Mr. Lambert: I am glad to hear that,
is not a very great opportunity for this
corporation to reduce its interest rates based because I think that it is an important aspect
of this whole business. If these documents

MAY 19, 1958
have to be tabled before we can discuss them,
then I would suggest they be tabled as soon
as possible and made the subject of a further
inquiry before the appropriate committee of
this house.
Hon. Donald Cameron: Honourable senators,
I would like to ask the Leader of the Government (Hon. Mr. Aseltine) whether there is
any intention, when this new money is made
available, to permit the National Housing Act
to be used for building university residences.
There was some discussion last winter to the
effect that section 16, which seemed to be the
appropriate section, might be modified in such
a way that universities could be looked upon
as limited dividend corporations and National
Housing Act funds made available to them.
If the plans are not advanced to where that
can be done with this new money, my second
question is: Does the Government contemplate making such an amendment to the act
in the near future?
Some honourable senators will recall that
on December 3 last I dealt with the subject
of the university residence situation in the
course of an address I made in the Senate.
At that time I had completed a survey of
Canadian universities, in which I had asked
for the number of residence rooms at each
university, the number of students living in
residence, the number living at home, and
the number living in boarding houses. About
60 per cent of the institutions gave me the
information I asked for.
Just to show how serious the situation
is, I would like to give again some figures
showing what the picture is now and what it
is likely to look like 10 years from now with
the increased enrollment in universities. The
number of residence rooms in those universities replying to the questionnaire was 6,663;
these rooms accommodated 7,570 students. It
was estimated that 50 per cent of the total
university population of 85,000, namely 42,500,
lived at home, and the remainder, approximately 35,000, lived in boarding houses of
varying degrees of quality. It is generally
accepted that university enrolment will increase substantially, and probably will double
in the next ten years. If that is so, the university student population in 1968 will be
approximately 200,000. The intentions to
build, as given last November by the universities, indicated that the amount of student
residence accommodation might be doubled.
That was a very optimistic estimate at that
time. In other words, by 1968 we might be
able to accommodate in the university residences some 15,000 students. On the basis
that 50 per cent of the students would be
living at home, there would be 100,000 living

in their homes, which would leave 85,000
students in boarding houses.
I would suggest, honourable senators, that
this is one place in which the Central Mortgage and Housing Act and the National
Housing Act could be put to exceedingly constructive use, and I hope that before long
plans will be made by the Government to
make possible the use of the funds granted
under the National Housing Act for the building of university residences.
I need not stress to a group like this
honourable body the great contribution to the
total educative process that is made by the
opportunity for students to live and work
together in a residence. A student who has
not had the advantage of living in a good
residence misses a great deal in his university
career. I would suggest, therefore, that we
do something about it at the earliest possible
moment.
In closing, may I say that I think the accomplishments under the terms of the National Housing Act have been very fine, but
I would like to support my colleagues from
Northumberland-Miramichi (Hon. Mr. Burchil) and St. John's West (Hon. Mr. Pratt),
who have said there is one big gap in the
program at the present time, namely, the
need for houses for people in the low income
bracket. I see no reason why we should not
take steps at an early date to bring these
people under the act as well.
Hon. A. Neil McLean: Honourable senators,
I have one or two suggestions to make for
the consideration of the Leader of the Government in connection with this bill.
I notice that the money that is proposed
to be used as loans for house building will
come from the consolidated revenue fund. I
agree with other honourable senators who
have said that 6 per cent interest rate is out
of line with present day conditions, if the
rate is not going to be flexible.
In connection with the Beechwood Power
project legislation, which was at a low interest rate, and a small commission charge
for the bookkeeping, I asked whether, if the
interest rate to the federal Government went
down, the rate on the loans would be flexible,
and I was told that it would be.
We know that when the Governor of the
Bank of Canada and the ex-President of the
New York Stock Exchange, now President of
the United States Federal Reserve Bank,
started putting the bank interest rate up, it
took several months-almost a year-for it
to permeate our economic system. The same
thing will happen when the rate goes down,
if my experience serves me right. The rate
is being steadily lowered. Those who were
responsible for putting the rate up are now

SENATE
going to cover as fast as they can. We see the
New York Federal Reserve Bank rate is
down to 1¾ per cent, and is around 2 per
cent here. As I say, it will take some months
for the effect of the change to reach us, but
certainly the interest rates are on the skids.
Therefore, I do not think we should tie the
small man or the small householder up for
the next 10 or 15 years to pay 6 per cent.
We are going to see the federal Government
borrowing at less than 3 per cent before a
year or two goes by. It is a noble undertaking for a man to build his own home, and I
think the rate the householder pays on borrowed money such as this should be flexible
and in keeping with the rate at which the
Government borrows money. There may be
a considerable margin there, and millions of
dollars will go to the middlemen if we are
not careful.
Hon. W. M.
ators,-

Aseltine:

Honourable sen-

The Hon. the Acting Speaker: Honourable
senators, if the honourable Leader of the
Government (Hon. Mr. Aseltine) speaks at
this time he will close the debate.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: -I wish to thank all
honourable senators who have spoken on this
bill for the great amount of interest they have
shown in it. I will do my best to answer the
various questions that have been asked, and
probably to explain things a little more fully
than was possible in the short time at my disposal last Friday.
May I say first that this measure bas nothing whatsoever to do with insured loans.
Perhaps I should tell honourable senators
something about insured loans with a view
to showing the difference between an insured
loan, which is more or less guaranteed by the
Government, and the agency loans under
which this money now being provided for will
be placed.
Insured loans are made by the lending
companies with their own money. They pay
an insurance premium of 2 per cent to Central
Mortgage and Housing Corporation. The
companies get a guarantee that if default
occurs, and they make a claim and deliver
possession of the vacant property, Central
Mortgage and Housing Corporation will pay
them 98 per cent of the principal outstanding,
plus legal disbursements and an acquisition
fee of $125, together with interest in part.
The interest formula covers full interest on
the mortgage for six months, plus interest for
12 months at the rate covered by the mortgage, less 2 per cent. That is an insured loan,
and it is entirely different from the agency
loans we are now speaking about.

The money to be provided under this bill
will be used for the following purposes. One,
to finance pending obligations which have
been made or were made just as the funds
were running out and therefore could not
be dealt with.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: How large is the
amount of these pending obligations in excess
of the money available under existing
legislation?
Hon. Mr. Aselline: I am not sure whether
the honourable senator's question will be
answered by this statement: the applications
which it was not found possible to take up
were returned to the lending companies,
which picked up three-fourths, or 75 per cent,
of them; the remaining 25 per cent are back
again for Central Mortgage and Housing
Corporation to deal with; and the money to
be provided under this bill will be used, first,
for this purpose.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I do not want to
interrupt the honourable gentleman, but can
he tell us why 25 per cent were sent back?
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: The companies were
not in a position to lend the money.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: The lending institutions have ceased lending money: is that so?
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: No, for they lent money
in respect of 75 per cent of the applications.
They sent back 25 per cent because, I assume,
they were short of funds.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: But the security was
just as good, was it?
Hon. Mr. Aselline: Yes, certainly.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Then how much is
represented by the 25 per cent that has come
back?
Hon. Mr. Aseltine:
loans?

That is, how many

Hon. Mr. Hugessen: No, the total aggregate
amount.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: In dollars?
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Yes. There was available $400 million, and we are now asked to
increase it to $750 million.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: All of the $400 million
except $7 million or $8 million has been used
up. I am sorry I did not get the significance
of the honourable gentleman's question.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: As I understood the
question of the honourable senator from
Inkerman (Hon. Mr. Hugessen) it was, what
is the amount in dollars of the 25 per cent of
applications which have been returned, and
on which loans are pending?

MAY 19, 1958
Hon. Mr. Aselfine: At the moment I cannot give that figure.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Perhaps the honourable gentleman can advise us before third
reading.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: I was explaining that the
money to be made available will be used (1)
to finance these pending applications; (2) for
direct loans by Central Mortgage and Housing Corporation to (a) limited dividend companies for low rental housing-I explained
in my remarks on Friday last what limited
dividend companies are-(b) to primary producer companies for rental housing for
employees; and (c) to individuals, mostly
living in small centres, who have been unable
to secure loans in the ordinary way. To
recapitulate, this money is intended, first, to
finance the pending applications; second, for
direct loans; third, as residual loans available
in ail centres to builders or individuals who
have been unsuccessful in obtaining loans
from lending companies.
The answer to the question asked by the
honourable senator from Inkerman (Hon. Mr.
Hugessen) is, $12,500,000.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Thank you.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: In answer to the question of the honourable Leader of the Opposition (Hon. Mr. Macdonald), size limits under
the agency arrangement were, mostly, 1,050
square feet, with three bedrooms, whereas
the insured loan, on the average, has been
much larger. That is to say, the dwellings
built under the insured loans are usually
much larger, running to 1,500 square feet or
more. The size of the typical home has been
growing for some time, and the agency limit
of today was the average of insured loans
three years ago, and is therefore substantially
above the typical size of 1947,-of which, I
assume, the honourable Leader of the Opposition was speaking, and which was only 839
square feet.
Hon. Mr. Reid: What is meant by "the
agency"?
Hon. Mr. Aseline: I explained ail that on
Friday. Does the honourable senator want me
to go back into that again?
Hon. Mr. Reid: No, I will look it up in
Hansard.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Next, perhaps, I should
refer to the interest rate. I thank the
honourable senator from Ottawa West (Hon.
Mr. Connolly) for referring to the report,
which I received at the same time he did,
but which I have not had much opportunity to
peruse. The honourable senator from Ottawa
West said that section 6 of the National Housing Act provides that the Governor in

Council may prescribe the maximum rate of
interest payable by a borrower, and that such
rates shall not exceed the interest rate on
long-term Government bonds by more than
two per cent, in respect of loans for house
building; but approved lenders have the right
to apply a lower rate than the maximum,
and on occasion have done so. As at the
beginning of the month, the yield on a
twenty-year theoretical Canada bond was 4
per cent, compared to 3.94 per cent a month
earlier. If, therefore, a rate were being currently prescribed, the statute would permit
the present maximum rate of 6 per cent to
be raised to 61 per cent. Ten years ago
it was 42 per cent. Joint loans were made,
with the Government contributing one-fourth
and the lender three-fourths of the loan.
But that is not being done any more. The
reason the rate has not been lowered is that
ordinarily on an investment such as a bond
the interest rate is 4 per cent, and in some
cases more; and I understand, from what
took place in the other chamber and from
what I have been told, that the Government
fears that if the interest rate were reduced
by any substantial figure the supply of mortgage funds would dry up.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Those are private
mortgage funds?
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Yes; and the Government does not want that to happen, because
it wants to get out of this lending business
as quickly as it can. It expects that the
money we will vote under this bill will last
for quite a long time.
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Oitawa West): It is
expensive money.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: I am sorry I cannot give
any more information with respect to the
interest question which has been asked of me.
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): Thank
you.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Before I leave this point
I should like to add that where loans are
advanced from public funds the statute specifies that the terms and conditions, including
interest, must be the same as for insured
loans. I believe I already answered the question with regard to rental housing when I
stated that loans for rental housing are fully
available under this insured system we have
been speaking about. Under the agency loan
system, loans for rental housing had to be
suspended in February because funds were
running out. There was the insured system
and the agency loan system, and the homes
under the latter system have had to be suspended on account of the fact that funds
were running out. That is why this money
is needed.

SENATE
The honourable senator from Shelburne
(Hon. Mr. Robertson) asked me what the
policy of the Government was with regard to
a certain matter. I just forgot the point for
the moment.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: I think perhaps the
honourable Leader of the Government has
referred to it himself. I asked whether the
Government was hopeful that private industry would step into the breach and supply
this money so that the Government might
not have to.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: I think I have dealt
with that.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: Does it expect that
may happen?
Hon. Mr. Aselline: Yes; in fact it hopes
this money will last a long time and that the
majority of these loans will be picked up by
investment corporations.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: The other question I
asked was as ta costs in 1958 compared with
those in 1957.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: I think the honourable
senator from St. John's West (Hon. Mr. Pratt)
gave us that information. The cost is up.

Hon. Mr. Robertson: The report, quite properly, is for the year 1957, but I was wondering
if the Government had any estimate as to how
costs this year would compare with those in
1957. That information would not be in this
report.
Hon. Mr. Aseliine: I do not think I have
any information on that now, but if I can
find out I will give the answer on third reading. I might say for the information of
honourable senators that the number of housing starts has accelerated considerably. Here
are the figures for 1956-57 and 1957-58. The
total starts for the period July 1956 to March
1957 were 75,521, whereas the total starts for
the period July 1957 to March 1958 were
90,853, an increase of 20 per cent. So I think
the progress being made is quite admirable
indeed, and with this money being made
available much greater progress will be made
in the months to come.
An honourable senator asked a question
with regard to how these loans were working
out, whether they were in arrears or not.
Approved lenders reported 263 insured mortgages in arrears, the equivalent of three or
more monthly payments as of March 31,
1958. I think that is a very satisfactory statement.
Hon. Mr. Connolly (O±awa West): Out of
how many outstanding?
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: I think that is on all
mortgages outstanding.

Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): I know,
but how many?
Hon. Mr. Aselline: It does not seem to be
a very high figure.
Hon. Mr. Lamberi: Has the honourable
leader the total amount that that would represent?
Hon. Mr. Aselline: It represents .17 per cent
of insured mortgages approved and is the
same percentage of loans in arrears to approvals as reported by approved lenders as
at March 31, 1957.
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): Thank
you, that is the answer.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Some of these questions
are rather difficult, you know, for a person
whoHon. Mr. Connolly (Otawa West): You are
doing well.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: You are doing fine.
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): You
don't need to apologize.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Has the honourable
leader got the figures with respect to loans
under this section of the act?
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: I am quite sure that I
gave those figures to the house on Friday.
There have been practically no foreclosures.
Approved lenders acquired title to 16 properties only. I would say that is quite a satisfactory situation.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Does that figure include any property acquired by Central Mortgage and Housing Corporation?
Hon. Mr. Aselline: These are by approved
lenders, the ones working under the premium
which gives them a guarantee.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: But has C.M.H.C.
taken possession of any houses?
Hon. Mr. Asel±ine: I cannot say, but I am
quite satisfied that the number is practically
negligible.
I do not know how to answer the honourable senator from Banff (Hon. Mr. Cameron),
who asked if it was the policy of the Government to extend the act to meet the problem
of shortage of student residences at universities. The pressing thing which confronts
us right now is not so much the building of
residences for university students as the
building of homes for the ordinary man in
the low rental group who cannot possibly
afford to build a home of his own. I am
afraid, therefore, that the university residence
question will have to stand in abeyance, for
the present at least. However, I assure the
honourable senator that I will bring the

MAY 19, 1958
matter to the attention of the Government
with a view to seeing what can be done.
The senior senator from Ottawa (Hon. Mr.
Lambert) said that perhaps this bill should
go to a committee. I would have no objection
to that, but at this moment I do not think
it is possible to take enough time to do so.
This is an emergency measure, and the minister is very anxious that it be passed by
both houses in order that the money can
be made available, for the reasons I have
mentioned. I assure honourable senators
that on every occasion when it is possible
to send a bill of this kind, or, indeed of
any other kind, to a committee, I shall be
glad to do so, but in this particular case I
would like to see the bill passed without
being sent to a committee. As a matter of
fact, the committees are not yet set up, and
if we were to wait until we can refer this
bill to the Banking and Commerce Committee, say after the chairmen of the various
committees have been chosen, and so on,
passage of the bill might be delayed until
next week. I know the minister is very
anxious that it receive the royal assent tomorrow if possible.
Hon. Mr. Dupuis: May I ask the leader if
the bill could not be discussed by the Committee of the Whole House immediately?
Hon. Mr. Aselline: I could not answer any
more questions in the Committee of the
Whole House than I have already answered.
Hon. Mr. Dupuis: An officer of the department could be called in.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: I do not think that
would be satisfactory in this particular case.
Later on we might have a debate on the
whole housing question; it seems to me that
could be arranged. I assure honourable senators that I have done my best to answer all
questions that have been asked of me. If
there are any others that require to be answered I will be glad to do so tomorrow on
third reading.

Hon. Mr. Aseltine: No. It is so urgent
that we would not have time to send it to a
committee, for the committees are not yet
set up.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: I thought the committees
were already set up, according to the record
of Hansard.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: The chairmen are not
yet chosen, nor the quorums arranged.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: Well, surely the committee could meet and appoint a chairman pro
tem. I wish to enter a protest against a
refusal, or a reluctance, to send this bill to
a committee. After all, what are we doing
by this proposed legislation? We are putting
an additional charge on the consolidated
revenue fund of $350 million, and surely that
is a matter of some consequence. I certainly
wish my honourable friend well, and at the
proper time I shall offer him some congratulations, but I think that a measure which
puts an additional charge of $350 million on
the revenue is worth some consideration by
a committee of this house.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: The principle of this bill
was fully decided upon when the measure
was before the bouse last November, when
the amount was raised to $400 million. The
present measure is just a continuation of the
situation and put men to work and keep them
working. I did not propose to send the bill
working. I did not propose to send the bill
to a committee.
Hon. Mr. Baird: You do not need to.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: That is all I know
about it.
Hon. Mr. Golding: Question.
Motion agreed to and bill read second time.
The Hon. Ihe Acting Speaker: Honourable
senators, when shall this bill be read the
third time?

Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Next sitting.

CENTRAL MORTGAGE AND HOUSING
CORPORATION
REPORT TABLED-REFERRED TO FINANCE
COMMITTEE

Hon. W. M. Aseliine: Honourable senators,

I beg to lay on the table the report, in French
and English texts, of Central Mortgage and
Housing Corporation for the year ended December 31, 1957, as required by section 33,
subsection (3) of the Central Mortgage and
Housing Corporation Act.
I now wish to make a motion with respect
to it which, I hope, will satisfy all honourable
members. With leave, I move, seconded by
the honourable senator from Lumsden (Hon.
Mr. Pearson):
That the report of Central Mortgage and Housing Corporation for the fiscal year ended the
31st December, 1957, be referred to the Standing
Committee on Finance for consideration and report.

Honourable senators, I would like to say a
word on this motion now. It appeared last
night from the debate which we had on Bill
C-10, to amend the National Housing Act,
1954, that a number of senators would like
to have the whole matter of housing fully
investigated with respect to the past, present
and future, and to have the National Housing
Act itself looked into. The purpose of my
motion is to give the work of this inquiry
to the Standing Committee on Finance, which
would call officials of the Central Mortgage
and Housing Corporation and any other witnesses it might desire to hear. The committee
would in due course submit a report to the
Senate, following which we could have an
all-out debate on the housing question. I feel
that this would be a fine piece of work for
the Senate to carry out. I am sure that if
the motion passes everyone will be satisfied
in a general way, and it will result in bringing to this chamber a great fund of information which we probably do not have at the
present time and which will be extremely
helpful to all of us and to the country at
large.
Hon. W. Ross Macdonald: Honourable
senators, I am quite in accord with the
motion. In fact, last night I was very anxious
that the bill should be referred to a committee. Nevertheless, I realized that if that
were done it could not possibly get to the

committee until tomorrow, with the result
that the bill would be reported back here at
the earliest tomorrow, and possibly not until
Thursday.
In reply to a question yesterday the honourable leader (Hon. Mr. Aseltine) stated that
Central Mortgage

and Housing Corporation

had only $8 million on hand to provide for
any contracts which might come forward for
approval; in fact, I think he said there were
many contracts awaiting approval. Ordinarily,
the bill should have gone to a committee, but
I think honourable senators realize why this
course was not followed. The leader was
kind enough to inform us, in the early part of
last week, of his proposal that the Senate
would adjourn on Wednesday afternoon until
Wednesday this week. That turned out to be
impossible; but when he made that proposal
to me he mentioned-and I must take some
of the responsibility for the decision that was
made-the question of when the committees
should be set up. I told him I thought there
would be plenty of time to do that this week.
However, legislation did not come from the
Commons as quickly as we had expected, and
we could not adjourn on Wednesday. We sat
on Thursday and Friday and re-assembled on
Monday instead of Wednesday. Under the
circumstances, it was impossible to have the
committees set up yesterday. I thought, therefore, that it would be advisable for us to give
the bill second reading last night, and third
reading today, in order not to hold up work
on many houses which are about to be started.
Honourable senators, I think the leader's
motion is an excellent one. Any of the questions which it is intended to ask of officials of
the Central Mortgage and Housing Corporation concerning this bill can be asked when
the corporation's report is being considered
by the committee.
There is one request I would make of the
committee, and that is that senators who are
not members of the committee be given every
opportunity not only to attend the meetings
but to ask questions just as freely as if they
were members of the committee.
Hon. Mr. Aseliine: And I think the proceedings should be reported.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I was just going to
suggest that. The committee will be doing a
very important work, and I think its proceedings should be reported, and the reports distributed as soon as possible, not only to the
public generally but to members of the house.
We are all interested in the housing question
and it seems to me that the honourable
leader's motion provides a good solution of
the problem which bothered us yesterday
when the bill was not referred to committee.

MAY 20, 1958
Hon. A. K. Hugessen: Honourable senators,
like my honourable leader (Hon. Mr. Macdonald) I welcome very warmly the motion
made by the Leader of the Government
(Hon. Mr. Aseltine). I think it is an excellent thing that he should suggest that a
committee of this house should consider
this extremely important report that we
have just received. After ail, it deals with
the lives and the homes of many hundreds
of thousands of Canadians.
I have always felt that there are large
departments of Government, such as Central
Mortgage and Housing Corporation, which
are doing a very valuable work but as to
which there is not sufficient publicity or
information available to the general public.
I recall that at one time when the honourable senator from Churchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar)
was chairman of the Finance Committee
we divided between us in that committee
the work of examining the activities of
various departments of the Government,
and to me that was a very salutary and a
very useful exercise. I found, and I think
the members of the committee found, that
the departmental officials were only too glad
to have the opportunity of appearing before
a committee of this house and explaining
to the committee the work that they were
doing. They do not often get that opportunity. The other place, for reasons of its
own, has not sufficient time to devote to
these things, and it seems to me an admirable idea that the Standing Committee on
Finance of this house should take up and
consider this most interesting report of the
Central Mortgage and Housing Corporation,
and examine into the workings of a department of the Government which, as far as
I know-and I think it is the general
impression-is doing a most admirable work
for the people of Canada.
Hon. T. A. Crerar: Honourable senators,
my contribution will be a very brief one. I
myself welcome very heartily the motion
that the Leader of the Government in this
house bas put forward. The matter is an
important one, and I would hope that when
the committee comes to inquire into the operations of the Central Mortgage and Housing
Corporation it may be permitted to inquire
a little further as to the need of the bill
that we put through last evening. What that
bill did was increase the charge on the Consolidated Revenue Fund by $350 million. This
was represented-and I want to keep well
within the facts-as an emergency measure,
based theoretically on the idea that there is
a great mass of unemployment in the land,
that it is important for the Government to

take action to mitigate the effect of this
unemployment, and that this was one method
of doing it.
There is here a rather fine distinction that
I think should be drawn to the attention of
honourable senators. Is this provision of an
additional $350 million a measure for the
promotion of housing for the betterment of
Canadian people, or is it more in the nature
of an unemployment relief measure? In my
opinion it is important to maintain that distinction, because there does not seem to me
to be very much evidence at the moment of
any drastic shortage of housing in Canada.
If we go on building new housing by the
tens of thousands a year, we are possibly
going to create a situation where the owners
of existing housing, who may want to dispose of it, will find themselves handicapped
in doing so. There must be a reasonable
balance held in this respect. For myself, I
am bound to say that I do not think there
is the unemployment problem, or any serious
consequence from unemployment, that some
of our newspapers and publicists try to give
the impression there is. We can get some
facts in relation to this, and we should have
them.
That is why I welcome the motion put
forward by the Leader of the Government in
this bouse. While it may not be strictly within
the purview of the committee to examine into
the need for all this additional housing, I
hope that sufficient latitude will be given the
committee to do thatHon. Mr. Aseltine: It will be wide open.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: -so that we can examine
the report and see how effectively the housing corporation has done its work. My own
view is that it has, on the whole, done it
efficiently and well. However, it is important
to pay some attention to the warning held
out by the Minister of Finance a week or so
ago when-if he was correctly reported-he
urged that the corporation should not aim to
supplant ordinary leaders for this class
of work.
These days we do seem to be getting more
and more extensions of government-shall I
say, interference, with the ordinary course of
our affairs. It has, I think, developed to quite
an alarming degree, because ultimately if the
Government is going to take the responsibility
of building all the houses for people, of looking after them when they are ill, providing
for them when they are unemployed, then
the question is bound to be raised in some
minds whether that is consistent with the
maintenance of what we call our democratie
freedoms. They do that sort of thing in
Russia, and they do it pretty efficiently; but,
at any rate at present, I am very far from

SENATE
being an advocate of the Russian system,
either in practice or by implication.
Hon. David A. Croll: Honourable senators,
I had intended to speak to the bill when it
came up for third reading, but in view of
the statements made by the very distinguished senator from Churchill (Hon. Mr.
Crerar) I think it would be interesting to the
house to know that there are points of view
other than his on the same subject.
I was not here on Monday to speak on this
matter, because I got my signals mixed a
bit, but I read the debate and thought it contained a considerable amount of painstaking
questioning, very well answered.
To my mind the bill is a good one, for it
helps the man who needs help, and helps
him now. It has two purposes: first, to
provide housing; second, to give employment.
The provision of homes for the Canadian
people is, and will long continue to be, vitally
important. The need for homes will be continuous, especially because of the increase
in our population, and particularly as regards
low-cost and low-rental housing. So far as
the employment feature is concerned, if there
is anyone in this house or in the other who
is not concerned with the condition of unemployment in this country, he is out of touch
with realities. It is a serious matter, and
anything we can do to alleviate it we ought to
do. In this connection house construction
has been a great help.
I am not going to discuss the shortcomings
of the bill, because that matter will be dealt
with in due course in committee. But it is
interesting to note that at present Central
Mortgage and Housing Corporation is financing four out of five bouses; and it is trying
to meet the need for long-term money on a
large scale. It is not meeting very well the
need for cheap money, but that also will be
a matter before the committee.
I think the bouse should take note of the
fact that the Government, through Central
Mortgage and Housing Corporation, is becoming the main source of funds for home
construction. Government lending in this field
is becoming more and more the normal thing;
as a matter of fact it is becoming a way of
life. I recognize that in the past mortgage
funds were regarded as an exclusive field
for private enterprise, but the Government
has now entered the private enterprise field.
Two reasons occur to me. The first, of course,
is that of national security. Everybody agrees
that such matters as atomic planning and
equipment, Arsenals, and Polymer Corporation are proper and appropriate governmental
undertakings. The second reason for Government action in spheres such as this is to
meet a social need where there is a vacuum.

In our welfare state vacuums are not permitted, and if the field bas been abandoned
by private enterprise the Government must,
as in the past, enter and fill it.
Historically, as I have said, the provision
of conventional house loans belongs to the
lending institutions. But it is interesting to
note-to give honourable senators two brief
examples-that 40 years ago there was a
great demand in this country for personal
security, which had not been met, with the
result that the then Government brought in
the Annuities Act. In doing so the Government entered a sphere in which no one
else wished to participate. The work of the
Annuities Branch became bigger and better,
and met with increasing appreciation. Some
of us here remember that 10 years later, I
believe in 1929, the farmers of this country
were unable to obtain loans for their land,
livestock, equipment and improvements; so
the Farm Loan Board came into existence.
Since that time Government intervention
bas occurred in dozens of various forms to
serve social purposes. As a matter of fact
I could very well say to the bouse, "You
name it, and we have it, or we think we
almost have it."
It was, as I recall, in 1951 that the Government decided to make direct loans through
the Central Mortgage and Housing Corporation. It began its work under rather extraordinary circumstances. Workers on defence
projects were accumulating in industrial
areas. It was hard to hold them. They
needed homes; they needed them quickly;
and mortgage companies would not lend
money for building in these new districts.
So the Government made direct loans to
defence workers. After that beginning, it
continued to fill this vacuum, and, now, of
course, we are in the direct loaning field
with both feet. It is a field which no
Government in the future can vacate.
Neither this nor any other Parliament would
permit it, now or at any time hereafter. It
would be politically unhealthy.
Nowhere
in recorded history can I find an example
of a Government, after initiating a social
measure, abandoning it.
I am not too
greatly worried about the lending institutions. They have only themselves to blame.
Whatever suffering they incur as a result
will be from self-inflicted wounds.
The study which is to be made by the
Finance Committee will be a very interesting
one. We shall have occasion to use the information so obtained; for, whether at this session or the next, the Government will be
back for more money, and we shall grant it.
It is inevitable that Central Mortgage and
Housing Corporation will issue its own securities-perhaps in the not too distant future-

MAY 20, 1958
and go directly to the public for investment
money. If it doesn't go in a primary position
it will'at least go in a secondary position and,
so, today while discussing this housing measure we find a repetition of what happened
yesterday. The Government is continuing to
spread its wings in the fields of social endeavour. This will mean it will provide more
and cheaper money and it will build more
and cheaper homes. This will provide more
security to the householder and give employment to our people in and out of season. I
like the prospects of the Government occupying that field. That is why I like the bill.
I also like the idea behind the motion that
has been placed before this house, for a
thorough study of this very competent
C.M.H.C. report, in order that we may more
thoroughly discuss this matter at some future
time. When amending legislation comes before us seeking more money, as I think
inevitably it will, we will be able to discuss
the matter in a more intelligent manner.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: I do not wish to get
into an argument with my honourable friend
from Toronto-Spadina (Hon. Mr. Croll), but
my information with regard to the percentage
is not the same as his. Central Mortgage and
Housing Corporation, according to my information, financed only about one-half of the
housing starts. This has been true only in
the past few months. Last year under the
National Housing Act one-third of the housing starts were financed.
Hon. Mr. Croll: I might say that I made
my notes today, and took them from Hansard
or some other record, I am not sure which.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: I suggest that the committee look into the matter.
Hon. Mr. Croll: Yes.
Motion agreed to.
STANDING COMMITTEES
QUORUMS REDUCED
Hon. Mr. Hawkins, Chairman of the Standing Committee on Finance, presented the committee's first report, recommending that its
quorum be reduced to nine members.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators,
when shall this report be taken into
consideration?
Hon. Mr. Hawkins: Next sitting.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Honourable senators,
the report merely contains a recommendation

as to the quorum for the committee. I understand a number of similar reports having to
do with the quorums of our various standing
committees will be presented this afternoon.
I attended the meetings of these committees
this morning and I understand that the
quorum set up for each is the same as it was
last year. It occurs to me that instead of
postponing consideration of these reports
until next sitting, we could consider and
adopt them now.
The Hon. the Speaker: The honourable
Leader of the Opposition suggests that they
be adopted right away?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Yes.
Hon. Mr. Hawkins: With leave of the
Senate, I move that the first report of the
Committee on Finance be adopted now.
Motion agreed to.
The first report of each of the following
standing committees, presented by or on
behalf of its chairman, recommended that its
quorum be reduced as follows:
The Committee on Transport and Communications, (Chairman, Hon. Mr. Hugessen),
quorum nine members.
The Committee on Civil Service Administration, (Chairman, Hon. Mr. Cameron),
quorum seven members.
The Committee on Public Health and Welfare, (Chairman, Hon. Mr. Veniot), quorum
seven members.
The Committee on Immigration and Labour,
(Chairman, Hon. Mrs. Wilson), quorum seven
members.
The Committee on Tourist Traffic, (Chairman, Hon. Mr. Horner), quorum seven
members.
The Committee on Canadian Trade Relations, (Chairman, Hon. Mr. McLean), quorum
seven members.
The Committee on External Relations
(Chairman, Hon. Mr. Lambert), quorum seven

AUTHORITY TO CONVENE SENATE DURING
ADJOURNMENT

Hon. W. M. Aseltine: Honourable senators,
I move, seconded by the honourable Leader
of the Opposition (Hon. Mr. Macdonald):
That, for the duration of the present session of
Parliament, should an emergency arise during any
adjournment of the Senate, which would in the
opinion of the Honourable the Speaker warrant that
the Senate meet prior to the time set forth in the
motion for such adjournment, the Honourable the
Speaker be authorized to notify honourable senators
at their addresses registered with the Clerk of the
Senate, to meet at a time earlier than that set
out in the motion for such adjournment, and nonreceipt by any one or more honourable senators of
such call shall not have any effect upon the
sufficiency and validity thereof.

He said: Honourable senators, this is the
usual motion that bas been presented within
the first two weeks of the opening of a
session of Parliament as far back as I can
remember. Its purpose is to authorize the
calling of honourable senators together if,
during any period when we have adjourned
because the work on our Order Paper bas
been completed, it is necessary to re-assemble
prior to the time fixed at adjournment.

STATES AGREEMENT

Hon. Norman P. Lambert: Honourable senators, may I take this opportunity of asking
the Leader of the Government (Hon. Mr.
Aseltine) if he can give any indication to the
house of whether the NORAD agreement will
be tabled and become a subject of discussion
here, as in the other house?
Hon. Mr. Aselline: Honourable senators,
this report bas not yet reached me; if and
when it does, I shall table it. In the meantime, I will make inquiries and see about
the matter.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I think it was tabled
here a day or so ago.
Hon. John J. Connolly: From an item on
page 54 of the Minutes of the Proceedings of
the Senate it appears that the agreement was
tabled here on Monday last.

The Senate proceeded to consideration of
His Excellency the Governor General's
speech at the opening of the session.
(Translation):
Hon. Gustave Monette moved:
That the following Address be presented to His
Excellency the Governor General of Canada:
To Ris Excellency the Right Honourable Vincent
Massey, Member of the Order of the Companions
of Honour, Governor General and Commander-inChief of Canada. May it please Your Excellency:
We, Her Majesty's most dutiful and loyal subjects,
the Senate of Canada, in Parliament assembled,
beg leave to offer our humble thanks to Your Excellency for the gracious Speech which Your Excellency has addressed to both houses of Parliament.

Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Monette: Honourable senators,
it is for me a great honour, and one of
which I feel quite unworthy, to move the
Address in reply to the Speech from the
Throne, which was delivered at the opening
of this Parliament by his Excellency the
Right Honourable Vincent Massey, Governor
General of Canada.
My first wish is to express my deepest
appreciation to the Leader of the Government, the honourable senator from Rosetown
(Hon. Mr. Aseltine), for having entrusted me
with this duty.
At this moment, we all recall with some
emotion the memorable day, on October 14,
1957, when for the first time in our country's
history, our Sovereign came in person to open
the Canadian Parliament. It fell to a woman
to fill this historic role and our minds and
hearts retain a vivid memory of the visit
of our Gracious Queen, Elizabeth II, who was
both so impressive in this regal function and
so great in her endearing humanity.
That happy event, which filled one of the
requirements of our Constitution, brings to
mind the notice given in the Speech from
the Throne by His Excellency the Governor
General of the forthcoming visit to Canada
of Her Royal Highness, Princess Margaret,
the dearly beloved sister of our stately
Sovereign. Everywhere in our country a
feeling of deep sympathy and respect awaits
this charming Princess, whose very human
nobility is a credit to the realm.
And so, true to its destiny, Canada is
achieving a better understanding of the boon
of a hereditary royal family, which is established by constitutional tradition above the
legitimate ambitions and strivings of parties,
which is respected and admired as such
abroad and which rallies within the country
the co-operation of all its citizens in the

SENATE
pursuit of the national objectives set out
and enacted by a parliamentary government
responsible to the people.
The Speech from the Throne indicates that
the Government intends to carry out a legislative program which is far-reaching both
in the importance of the subject-matters
mentioned and in its foreseeable consequences. May I be permitted to bring a few
of its aspects to the attention of honourable
senators.
First of all, I wish to point out the wide
program of social and economic security.
These last few years, Canada has entered,
without being quite aware of it at first, but
to an ever-increasing degree, into a period of
diminishing prosperity, followed by a recession that soon threatened to become a serious
depression. By a striking coincidence, the
same situation was developing, simultaneously
and even becoming more pronounced, in the
United States of America.
From the end of the war to the last three
or four years, our country, however, had
experienced an era of prosperity, astonishing
in many respects. Credit must be given to
whom credit is due.
Great manufacturing plants were established in our cities and towns, from coast to
coast. Out in the country, around the small
and large centres, farmers were lured by
wages that made them scorn the slender returns from the ancestral land. Despite the
assistance of governments, particularly the
provincial governments, agriculture was partially abandoned. At the same time, it seemed
necessary to carry out an intensive program
of immigration, from a humanitarian point
of view with regard to the many unfortunate
victims of communist oppression and by
reason of that great economic development
which seemed such a godsend.
Naturally, the house-building industry experienced an unprecedented, yet at all times
inadequate, development, so great was the
necessity of providing accommodation for the
ever-increasing number of new Canadian
families.
But such prosperity was not without its
risks. Great production and commercial companies increased very rapidly. Due to the
system of interlocking joint stock companies,
known as parent companies, subsidiary companies and sister or associated companies, an
enormous volume of investment capital
brought in by our neighbours, and indeed our
most powerful competitors, contributed not
only to the growth of our commercial and industrial economy, to the development of our
natural resources, but also to the export of
our raw materials. Meanwhile, on the whole,
we were importing more and more foreign
manufactured products; many were necessary,

it is truc, but a great deal were intended
merely to satisfy our hunger, legitimate perhaps, for excessive comforts and luxuries.
As a matter of fact, economically, politically
and internationally speaking as well, we
were following full steam ahead in the wake
of the most powerful Western nation, our
neighbour to the South, who since the last
war, for the sake of its own security and
that of the United Nations of course,-though
having in view its own tremendous development,-was dragged along with its partners,
in a stupendous race towards what was and
still is the very survival of democratic states,
of human, civic and religious freedoms,
threatened by the octopus of communism.
We are not yet out of danger. Some countries of the Western bloc and some outstanding statesmen, such as the Marquis of
Salisbury, are concerned with the exact meaning of the international policy of the United
States in regard to the critical situation between East and West, to the crisis in IndoChina, in the Near East, in Egypt, in the
Arabian States and in North Africa.
In the meantime, however, the too great
economic interdependence between the Western countries, especially between Canada and
our mighty neighbour to the South, has compelled us to reappraise our way of thinking
and to take a second look at the situation.
Our economy and our national policies as
well, though closely tied to those of mighty
America, must not be dominated by them. It
is only fair that we should remain masters of
our own decisions instead of being inevitably
swayed by the rigid workings of economic
complexities. That does in no way imply
unfriendliness, but we wish to maintain
between our two nations friendly relations
based on the respect of each other's rights.
Indeed, the United States and Canada share
with England and France so many dear and
glorious memories, that it is inconceivable
that the good will and the respect we have
toward one another could come to an end.
As for us, Canadians, in order to work
toward the common good and to give our full
measure of co-operation, we must remain
masters of our political decisions, we must be
completely free to adjust our economic relations so as to improve our ever-increasing
unfavourable commercial balance. We must,
on the one hand, freely control, even prohibit
if necessary, the excessive inflow of foreign
capital in our industry; on the other hand,
we must be in a position to expand our trade
with all countries without interference from
any quarters which might be looked upon as
worthy of proponents of the law of the jungle.
Sincerely wishing that true friendly and
fair relations be maintained between our
country and our allies, we enthusiastically

MAY 21, 1958
welcome the visit which Mr. Eisenhower,
President of the United States, will make to
Canada in the near future.
Under these circumstances, the first step
was to remedy the situation at home. The
head of the Government, the Right Honourable John G. Diefenbaker, introduced in both
houses, in October, 1957, during the first
session of our new Parliament, a widespread
program of social security measures, in
the form of increased pensions to our senior
citizens, to the sick and to the disabled, to
needy mothers, as well as relief benefits to
the unemployed and to our veterans.
Furthermore, he announced that plans for a
large-scale public works program were being
drawn up in order to relieve and check unemployment, and at the same time in order
to open up our northernmost frontier and
develop our immense resources. In the meantime, a significant drop in the registration of
job-seekers had been noticed in employment
offices.
The honourable members of both houses,
conscious of their social and political duties,
passed the proposed legislation and, finally,
at the general election of March 31 last, the
Canadian people clearly endorsed this legislation and the implementation of this farreaching program.
The important undertakings mentioned in
the Speech from the Throne are geographically distributed over our whole country,
with emphasis laid on its northern section.
May I point out a few:
(a) The survey and development of our
mineral resources in the islands of the Arctic
Ocean, in the far north;
(b) The building of a railway as far north
as Great Slave lake, with the aim of promoting national development on our northern
frontier and establishing manufacturing plants
on a really economic basis in the Northwest
Territories;
(c) The building of roads needed for development in the Yukon, the Northwest
Territories and the provinces, with the cooperation of their Governments;
(d) The construction of the South Saskatchewan project, with its dams and great
reservoir in the heart of the prairie, in order
to further the productive development of this
part of Canada;
(e) And finally, the establishment of a
Harbour Commission to combine the harbours
of Fort William and Port Arthur and to equip
this Lakehead basin with the facilities needed
to handle the larger traffic to be expected as
a result of the opening of the seaway; indeed,
we must not lose sight of the fact that in
addition to the above, the deepening of the
St. Lawrence-from its headwaters to Mont-

real and especially in the Montreal sectionis proceeding rapidly in order to give our
great water way the required depth to accommodate ocean-going ships.
In brief, this is a tremendous adjunct to
the economic and rational opening of our
country from its northernmost boundary to
the sea.
Honourable senators, an important point
to note is the fact that the trend of this
development and of the commercial and industrial movement which will result is partly
in a north-south direction as far down as the
Great Lakes where it joins the St. Lawrence,
and thence eastward to the Atlantic. It is
hoped, therefore, that our trade will expand
through wholly Canadian channels toward
the ocean and to foreign countries, as well
as to those of the commonwealth. We shall,
therefore, enjoy a much greater independence
in the economic field, and thus the hope so
long cherished by our greatest statesmen,
irrespective of parties, will be fulfilled.
In this connection, the announcement of the
Commonwealth Economic and Trade Conference to be held in Montreal next September is most significant and promising.
The plan announced by His Excellency to
increase immediately the public funds made
available under the National Housing Act has
already been implemented. The interesting
and harmonious debate to which it gave rise
in this chamber reflects the desire of honourable senators to devote to its consideration
the best of their attention and experience,
in order to find solutions most favourable to
the national interest.
His Excellency, in the name of the Government, also announced that unremitting
efforts will be made to sell our agricultural
products in the markets of the world. Our
farmers are thereby greatly encouraged. The
passing, at the last session, of the Agricultural Stabilization Act has shown them that
their Government means to remain in close
contact with them in order to maintain a
system of reasonable support prices. They
are very gratified about it. The same is true
of the act to provide cash advances on farmstored grain. Such a policy is of great encouragement to the farmers and, as well,
most helpful to the general economy.
I feel bound to make some reference to the
relaxation which has taken place since the
last session in the tight money policy with
regards to loans in Canada. This reversal of
policy awakens the hope that the financing
of important public works may be undertaken by the central, provincial and municipal governments; furthermore, it seems to
have removed in a large measure the danger
of returning inflation.

SENATE
Note should also be taken, in the economie
field, of the announcement that there will
be established a section within the administrative machinery of government to provide
liaison between the Government and small
businesses, in order to provide them with
justified assistance.
All these important plans of development
and assistance have awakened throughout the
country the hope that excessive unemployment will gradually diminish and stop and
that the signs of depression will disappear.
But we must, I believe, give credit to the
Government for having at this time strongly
recommended in the Speech from the Throne,
to ail classes of the population, to be mindful of the danger of inflation and of the need
and even the duty to restrict any demands
or plans which might tend to cause a rise in
prices and production costs.
It has been suggested, and rightly so, that
our estimated expenditure in this field is
enormous and even reaches a new high.
Nevertheless, the most imperative duty of
governments is to watch over the physical
and moral conservation of its human capital.
To govern is to foresee. A great Christian
philosopher has claimed that, in order to
maintain his moral values, man must enjoy
an honest sufficiency. We must not allow
poverty to take root among our good people
and to cause them to lose the intellectual
and moral values which constitute our
greatest asset.
During boom periods the people favoured
by birth and fortune, endowed with intelligence, boldness, knowledge and even with
luck, are laden with success and material
wealth. Consequently, when an economic
crisis arises, it is their duty to cut down on
comforts and their legitimate desires, and
to put up with the taxes necessary to give
back to the suffering masses of society a
part of what they have received from them.
In return for the boom of prosperity we
must, when necessary, cope with deficits in
our economy. Honourable senators, I trust
that from the bottom of our hearts we ail
wish to alleviate the present unfortunate
condition which is the lot of too great a
number of workers, and above ail to see
that it does not get worse and does not last
too long.
I would like to say but one word about
the tense international situation. We ahl
rejoice that in the Speech from the Throne
the Government did not close the door on
serious discussions with great or small
nations, at the summit or at lower levels, in
order to seek means to maintain peace
throughout the world. We do appreciate
even more the fact that our Government
does not intend to declare war against

foreign countries, without very serious
reasons. The economic and social legislation
program already mentioned is a guarantee
in this respect. It is useless to wage war
outside the country if our own house is not
in order: Parvi enim sunt foris arma, nisi
consilium domi.
But the danger of a world war is ever
present. The whole world is divided into
two rival camps of imponderable strength;
they are distrustful and sometimes even
suspicious of each other! It is possible
nevertheless that both sides are quite sincere.
But until we are better informed, we must
be ever on the alert. That is why the
Speech from the Throne, with the utmost
moderation, in spirit as well as in word,
reflects the wish expressed by the people
of so many nations, that the tremendous
scientific developments be used to promote
the welfare of mankind rather than warfare
and war implements. And of course, it also
expresses the need of maintaining suitable
armed forces to prevent and deter ail nations
from any possible aggression. We must
thank the Government for its sense of measure in dealing with so delicate a matter.
Actually, the danger of war is ever present.
Indeed, there always have been unjust conflicts, dishonest and barbarie ventures. But
also, there have been honest and human
statesmen who held sincere but divergent
opinions about the necessity of some grave
conflicts, which each belligerent believed
justified and to be defensive wars. Let us ask
God to give to ail nations the necessary wisdom so that we shall not witness in this
atomic age the incredible cataclysms which
could destroy the whole world created by
Providence for our happiness.
Honourable senators, in my closing remarks,
I wish to point out, with an admiration that
I beg you to forgive, a noteworthy characteristic of the head of the present Government,
the Right Honourable John G. Diefenbaker.
It has been said about him, and we who sit
to the right of the Speaker-and especially
those of us who come from the province
of Quebec hold this view-that the Right
Honourable Prime Minister bas never made
anywhere in Canada, during his political
campaigns, whether he was in opposition or
in power, a speech that he could not have
repeated in any other province. Nowhere has
he appealed to prejudice that would have
been condemned elsewhere. He did not believe he should speak to the French and
Catholie population of Quebec or of any other
part of the country in different terms, as far as
political and social principles were concerned,
from those which he used when addressing
Canadians of different religions and cultures,
or even new Canadians. For that we want

MAY 21, 1958
to congratulate and thank hlm. In Sa daing,
hie flot only rendered justice ta the English
provinces and ta Canadians of ail extractions,
but in Quebec hie respected aur pride in the
belief that aur religiaus aspirations and aur
Latin culture cauld nat be cansidered ini any
other section of the country as an obstacle
ta the develapment throughaut the country
of really Canadian political sense.
Hanourable senatars, may I, in addressing
this tribute of admiration ta my leader,
express my deep esteemn and my prafound
sympathy ta his predecessor, the Right Hanourable Louis St. Laurent, who feit he should
withdraw from the direction of his party and
from palitical activity. He represented in the
eyes of his province and of the whole country
the essence of hanour and, in his time, hie
achieved great things which will have a happy
influence on Canada's destiny.
it is with such feelings, honourable
senators, that I have the hanour ta mave the
Address to His Exceliency the Governor
General in reply to the Speech from the
Throne.
(Text):
Hon. Gunnar S. Thorvaldson: Honaurable
senators, may I first congratulate the honourable senatar tram, Mille Isies (Han. Mr.
Manette) upon the dignifled and eloquent
manner in which lie has discharged the duty
laid upon him of moving the Address in
reply ta the Speech fromn the Throne.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Thorvaldson: In the same breath,
I wish ta apalagize ta the honourable gentleman for the fact that I am nat able as yet
ta follow the meaning of bis speech as fuiiy
as I would like ta do, but I want ta say ta
hlm that at ieast I hope that defect wiil be
cured before I have been here too many
years.
I also, am happy ta have the opportunity
of speaking for the flrst time in this house
in the raie of seconding the motion that the
honourabie gentleman lias made. I deem it
not anly a personai honour but aiso an
honour ta the province which I among others,
represent in this bouse, nameiy, the province
of Manitoba.
In eastern Canada, Manitoba is generally
thaught of as a yaung part af Canada. Well,
it may be young in termis of modem development, but it is aid in history. I am somewhat
sorry that the honourable senatar tram
57075-4-5

Shawinigan <Hon. Mr. Méthot) does nat happen ta be in bis seat this atternoon because
I want ta say something that I think would
interest hlm more than others in this house.
That is, I wish ta refer ta the close historical
association of his cammunity, Trais Rivières,
with the province of Manitoba. As early as
the year 1611 those intrepid explorers, Pierre
Radisson and Sieur de Groseilliers left Trois
Rivières on an expedîtion ta the West which,
iA is believed, brouglit them, as the flrst white
men, ta gaze upan the waters of Lake Winnipeg. There is no doubt in any event that
they were the flrst white men ta reach the
west end of Lake Superior, where indeed the
West begins. But the connection does not end
there. Some 60 years later-and that indicates how yaung they were when flrst they
went an the expeditian that 1 referred tathe same Radissan and de Groseilliers were
advisers ta King Charles II when lie granted
the famous charter ta Prince Rupert and his
Company of Merchant Adventurers trading
into Hudson's Bay. The date of that charter
was May 2, 1670. And tram aur point of
view the history of my part of Canada can be
said ta have begun in that year.
My next words should apprapriately be an
expression of thanks and appreciation ta the
members of this body for their obviously
warm and sincere welcame to myseif as a
newcomer lin this house. And I am sure that
my fellaw neophyte senators who were also
sworn in as members of the Senate on the
opening day of this Parliament would wish
me to express this appreciation on their behaîf as well as an my awn.
To yau, Mr. Speaker, I would like ta do
something more than merely congratulate you
upon your continuance in the high office of
Speaker of the Senate, which I naw do. But
I would aiso like ta pay tribute ta the distinguished service which you performed for
the very institution of Parliament itself in
the conspicuausly dignifled manner in which
yau performed the function of your office,
for ail Canadians ta see, at the apening of
Canada's Twenty-Thlrd Parliament by Her
Mai esty the Queen last October. That was
indeed a mromentous occasion in the politicai
lite of Canada and especially in the awareness of Pariament which became manifested
in the minds and hearts of individual Canadians in every part of this far-flung country.
I would now like ta be allowed to express
ta the persan whomn I have known longer
than anyone else in this house, the honour-

SENATE
able the senior senator from Winnipeg (Hon.
Mr. Haig), my very warm regards and my
congratulations upon the manner in which he
performed his duties as Government Leader
in this house and indeed as a member of the
cabinet during the Twenty-Third Parliament.
Among other attachments to Senator Haig
-as he often reminds me, he was a deskmate of my father in the Manitoba Legislature 44 years ago. Mr. Haig, as you know,
continued to be re-elected to that body,
despite the great adversity which occurred
to our party in Manitoba in that early era,
while my father, no doubt to his personal
advantage, failed to be returned to that house
in the next election.
With reference to politics in Manitoba, I
hope that in this non-partisan body I may
be excused if I refer to the fact that on June
16 the electors of that province will have an
opportunity of electing a new Government;
and without attempting to indulge in prophecy
I just wish to say that some of my, no doubt,
prejudiced Manitoba friends tell me that the
adversity of that former era that I referred
to may perhaps be redressed at that time.
To you, sir, the honourable senator from
Rosetown (Hon. Mr. Aseltine), may I offer
my sincere congratulations upon your selection as Government Leader in this house?
This honour is indeed a fitting tribute to your
ability and devotion to duty as well as to your
long tenure of office in this house. We from
the Prairie Provinces-and indeed, we from
the West-rejoice, as Westerners, in the successes and achievements of our colleagues
from that part of Canada, and I am sure that
honourable senators will excuse me if I
reiterate that I naturally take pride in the
fact that the Leader of the Government in
the other place and the Leader of the Government in the Senate both come from the
West. And of course I also take pride in the
fact that both of them are residents of
Saskatchewan, for I myself was a resident of
that province for a period of seven years
and I graduated from the provincial university there, as did the Prime Minister.
In this passing reference to western Canada, and especially to the Prairie provinces,
may I add that there have been timesindeed, within living memory-when we have
been deemed a poor relation. I want now to
place myself squarely on record as saying
that we westerners are a poor relation no
more. It is true that up to about a decade
ago our wealth emanated largely from the

surface of the ground. Now, however, as is
so well known, untold riches in both oil and
other mineral wealth lie buried under the
surface of this vast area of our country.
Now, honourable senators, I would like to
touch upon a facet of the Canadian scene to
which some-at least local-prominence has
been given in some newspapers. That is to
the effect that I am the first person of
Icelandic origin to be appointed to the Senate
of Canada. That is, of course, true. Consequently, I thought it might not be inappropriate if on this occasion I made a few
brief remarks in regard to Icelandic immigration to Canada, and something about what we
hope is deemed by others to be a useful contribution to the building of our nation.
Immigration from European countries,
other than the United Kingdom and France,
did not really commence to any considerable
extent until the early 1870's. The first of
the immigrant groups to come in considerable
numbers were the Mennonites, who arrived
in 1874. These people were originally German and Dutch, but came from Russia.
Honourable senators will remember that
they had migrated from Holland and Germany about 100 years previously under offers
from the Russian Government, or the
Emperor, of that time, that they would not
be subject to military duty. In the early
1870's Catherine the Great, I think, withdrew that promise, and as a result they
migrated to the Western world. A fairly
large group of these people settled in colonies
on the lush Red River Valley soil south of
The integration of the MenWinnipeg.
nonites into the Canadian way of life was,
for reasons that must be clear to you all,
slow. But now these people, in the third
and fourth generation here, are making
rapid progress both in adopting the Canadian way of life and in becoming well-to-do
from an economic point of view. The Mennonites are splendid agriculturists and are
now indeed making southern Manitoba into
a veritable garden. They have even progressed so far that their community is represented in the present House of Commons
by an elected member sitting to the right
of Mr. Speaker. The Icelanders were a
little more rapid in their political advancement, having first elected a representative
to the Legislature of Manitoba on the side
of Mr. Speaker that I have just referred to,
exactly 50 years ago, in 1908. My father
was the second person elected to that special
side of the house, namely, in the year 1914.
It is of some interest that Lord Dufferin,
who became Governor General of Canada in

MAY 21, 1958
1872, was largely instrumental in directing
Icelandic immigration to Canada. He had
visited and toured Iceland in 1855 and had
then developed a considerable affection for
the Icelanders. Emigration from Iceland,
which began in the early 1870's, was originally intended for the area in and around
Wisconsin, U.S.A., but at Lord Dufferin's
suggestion the Canadian Government took
appropriate steps to direct some of this
immigration to Canada. As a result, in the
year 1875 a group of 285 of these people
settled in what was then a very inhospitable
region on the west shore of Lake Winnipeg,
approximately 60 miles north of the present
city of Winnipeg. The next year a group
of over 1,200 arrived. They named their
point of settlement on Lake Winnipeg Gimli,
the English word for which is Paradise or
Haven of the Gods.
In succeeding years additional immigrants
followed and the original numbers multiplied. They, of course, suffered the grievous
hardships that generally go with pioneering
in a rugged virgin country; but in course of
time they prospered and gradually began
to permeate into other parts of Manitoba
and Canada.
It is now 83 years since the first Icelandic
settlement in Manitoba. And I think I can
proudly say that the Icelandic people have
assumed in full measure the obligations and,
of course, the privileges of Canadian citizenship in both peace and war, and have become
a robust strand in the fabric of our Canadian
nationhood.
When one considers that today 24 per cent
of the people of Canada are of national
origins other than English or French, it
becomes apparent that the integration of
these various national strains that have come
here, into Canadian citizenship-or into the
Canadian fabric of nationhood, as we say-is
a matter of prime importance in our national
development. This process of integration has,
of course, taken time, and will take time.
But I want to say that despite the great
efforts and desires of us newcomers to take
our places as full-fiedged Canadians, I freely
confess that upon occasion we should pay our
humble respects to the strains that were here
first, that assumed the very first pioneering
that was done in this country, and who have
now accepted us into a first-class citizenship
along with themselves. Canada has indeed
been good to us.
I frankly admit that I have not as yet made
reference to any of the subject-matters dealt
with in the very comprehensive Speech from
the Throne. My excuse is, of course, that all
the subject-matters in it will be debated in
detail during the course of the session. But
I would like to say a few words on a subject
57075-4--51

which has indeed been a favourite topic for
both after-dinner and other speakers in
Canada since Confederation. That is the subject of "Canadian Unity". At times we have
been made to shiver in our shoes at the imminence of the break-up of Canada. What
pieces we were going to break into I really
don't know, or how a break-up could at any
time have benefited anyone. I quite confess,
of course, that there have been here, as in
most other nations from time to time, periods
of great stress and strain. Fortunately, however, tolerance between races, creeds and
classes has always come on top. But to my
mind the maximum of national unity that this
country has ever known occurred on March
31 last. I don't say this, and I hope it is not
so understood in this house, in a narrow
partisan way. But I would say that for the
first time since 1885-I use that year not
because it was an election year, but because
of the events that had their beginning in that
year-there has been fought in Canada a
general election in which neither old and
deep sores, nor racial or religious or, indeed,
economic bigotry played any part whatsoever.
And in the result we have achieved a Government having a substantial majority in the
other place which is nearly equally representative of every part of Canada and of every
race, class and creed. Also, for the first time
in 37 years, apart from one very small
splinter group, we have in fact returned to
a two-party democracy, namely, the Government on one side and Her Majesty's loyal
Opposition on the other.
Hon. Mr. Howard: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Thorvaldson: That is as things
ought to be. That is the way in which our
system of Government works best. Government under democracy is difficult enough at
any time. It is good to have it under the best
conditions.
If these things that I have mentioned are
not a sure and certain sign of the maximum
in national unity, then I don't know what
unity is. On the positive side, are there
other factors? No new affirmation is, of
course, necessary in regard to our relationship
to the Crown, to the Commonwealth, to the
United Nations or to NATO. Those relationships remain steadfast, and I am happy to
say, as they ought, to be, largely bipartisan.
But, to my mind, there is one other
important aspect in which Canadian opinion
is more unified than ever before. It is our
determination to remain Canadian in all
things. This statement may seem like an
over-simplification. Perhaps it is. But the

SENATE
matter I am referring to is our relationship
to our great neighbour to the south. I don't
intend at this time to make any extensive
remarks in regard to this very broad and
important subject. All I want to say is that
in my view a large majority of Canadians
are of the opinion that certain facets of the
relationships between our two countries are
out of gear. Or shall I say that there is sand
in some of the gears! Whether we are right
or wrong or partly right and partly wrong
in this conception, the important thing at
the moment is that the frictions between our
two countries, having been brought into the
open, will be, and are now, the subject of
public discussion on both sides of our common
border as never before.
Under such circumstances it may be
expected that the democratic process will
quickly assert itself and the gears will begin
to function more smoothly in due time. But
the only point I wish to make now is that
our relationships with the United States,
essentially those commercial and economic,
must in future be the subject of continuous
thought, consultation and statesmanship if our
association as the two chief tenants of this
continent is to remain amicable and equitable
to both countries. More than that, it also
seems essential that discussions between our
countries should not be held only on the
executive level, but that they should permeate
fully into the Houses of Congress of our
neighbour, and indeed into our Parliament
as well.
I must add, and I think it fits in with the
remarks I am making in this regard, that
I am particularly pleased with the resolution
which was introduced yesterday in the other
place urging the appointment of a committee
for the purpose of studying the relationships
between the two countries.
Already, and resulting from the mild shock
of June 10 last, Congress itself has begun to
take note of Canada. I think the recent visit
here of the Honourable Brook Hays and the
Honourable Frank M. Coffin, both members
of the U. S. House of Representatives and of

the Committee on Foreign Aff airs in Washington, was a gracious gesture to Canada. It
shows that Congress is aware of current frictions between us and is determined te take
Canada for granted at least a little less than
in the past. This is a big step in a right
direction.
In closing these remarks I don't think I
could do better than to quote the final
paragraph of the Hays and Coffin report on
their Special Study Mission to Canada, which
was published in Washington only a couple
of weeks ago. It is quite brief:
Canadian and United States interdependence
demands a new category of relationship. Canada
does not stand in a position toward us of a
"foreign" country. By no means should it be
considered as a poor relation. The concept to be
realized in the best interests of both countries is
that of free and powerful nations of different background and capabilities, united through a basic
agreement on values and aspirations, and voluntarily joined in enterprises, domestic and foreign.
calculated to strengthen the chances for a world
reflecting their common values. This is the challenge for Canadian-United States relations.

To me, some of the sentences indicate the
beginnings of the realization of a changing
concept in Washington in regard to the basic
relationships of our two countries. The time
was when the United States could well afford
to take Canada for granted and we were of a
size and strength that we couldn't do much
about it. But this is a new day and a new era
and, with the enormous interdependence between us in every facet of our relationships,
military, economic, commercial and cultural,
the time has, I believe, arrived for a substantial reappraisal of at least some of these
relationships.
And now, to conclude, it gives me much
pleasure to second the motion for the Address
in reply to the Speech from the Throne.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Macdonald, debate

(Text):
The honourable senator who seconded the
motion (Hon. Mr. Thorvaldson) gave us a
very interesting discourse, and his references
to the island of Iceland were very informative.
He told us how his people came from that
island and settled in Canada. I was very
delighted, as I am sure we all were, to
learn that on their arrival here they named
the place where they settled on Lake Winnipeg Gimli, which in English means Paradise
or Haven of the Gods. He said they were
happy to have come to Canada, and I was
very pleased to hear him say "Canada has
indeed been good to us." He also gave us
very interesting references to the settlement
of the province of Manitoba. He stated that
at times westerners have been regarded as
poor relations. Well, I wish to assure him
that we easterners, notwithstanding what was
said about us in the West, never did consider
westerners poor relations. But what pleased
me more than all was when he said that
westerners are poor relations no longer.
The honourable senator referred to his
father and another Icelander as having been
members of the Legislature of Manitoba. It
was once my pleasure, and that of a number
of other senators seated here today, to sit in
the House of Commons with one whose forebears were Icelanders-a man who has
brought great distinction to himself and to
his country, a Rhodes scholar, who became a
member of the cabinet of the Dominion of
Canada, and is still living today and is a
friend of many of us-the President of the
Exchequer Court of Canada, the Honourable
Joseph Thorson.
Honourable senators, I come now to the
Speech from the Throne itself. It gives us a
forecast of certain legislation which the Government proposes to introduce, but of course,
doesn't tell all. I ask myself how much of
this legislation can be and will be introduced,
in the first instance, in the Senate. It is often
said that the business of Parliament could be
accelerated if a larger percentage of public
bills were introduced, in the first instance, in
the Senate--that is, prior to their introduction
in the House of Commons. There is, however,
a very definite limitation to the number of
such bills which can originate here. Section
53 of the British North America Act provides
that:
Bills for appropriating any part of the public
revenue, or for imposing any tax or impost, shall
originate in the House of Commons.

That is, money bills must originate in the
House of Commons.
From a perusal of the legislation forecast
in the Speech from the Throne there appear
to be few if any bills which will not require
the expenditure of very large sums of public
money. Accordingly, under section 53 of the
British North America Act, practically none
of the announced legislation can be initiated
in this house. Speeches from the Throne at
best give only an obscure picture of the
contemplated legislation. There will, I am
certain, be other legislation than that which
has already been announced, and probably
some of it will not come within the provisions of section 53 of the British North
America Act. I would urge upon the Leader
(Hon. Mr. Aseltine) that he do all in his
power to have such legislation first introduced and discussed in the Senate. I know
that is a difficult task, for I have sat in his
position, as bas also the honourable the
senior senator from Winnipeg (Hon. Mr.
Haig), and we realize that frequently a minister wants to introduce his own legislation
in the other house. Any legislation that is
initiated here will receive the most careful
scrutiny, both in the bouse and in committee,
and the leader can assure the Government
that when it is presented to the Commons it
will be in such form that much time of that
house can be saved.
In connection with legislation which is
introduced here, I would like to support the
suggestion regarding the explaining of bills
made on Friday last by the senior senator
from Ottawa (Hon. Mr. Lambert). A number
of senators have spoken to me about this and
have asked me to support the proposal.
Honourable senators who sometimes sit in
the gallery of the House of Commons have
observed that when a bill is introduced in
that bouse some member invariably calls out
"Explain!" The member introducing the bill,
whether a minister or a private member,
then makes a short statement about it; and
thus from the very outset members of the
house have some idea of the nature of the
proposed legislation. I feel that before consenting to a bill going on the Order Paper
in this house we should know something at
least of its contents-and this applies not
only to public bills, but also to private bills
which honourable senators introduce from
time to time. I think it would be worth
while for us to adopt this practice, and I
would ask the Leader of the Government to
give some consideration to the proposal.
Honourable senators, may I now turn to
consideration of the attitude which I think
the Opposition in the Senate should take
toward Government legislation. This is of
special importance in view of the relatively

SENATE

small number of Government supporters in
this house, and, conversely, the relatively
small number of supporters of the Opposition in the other house. Fortunately for us
here, in the words of the late Senator
Dandurand:
We stand above the sharp divisions of party that

exist in the other chamber, . . .
I am sure honourable senators will agree
with me that we should not allow narrow
party prejudice and political advantage to
be the overriding consideration in our attitude
toward legislation which comes to us.
The Government, we must admit, is faced
with many difficult problems, not only at
home but also abroad. Every day we hear
of wars and rumours of wars. Indeed, it
would appear that we are living on the edge
of a smoldering volcano. In view of the
tension in international affairs and the serious
problems at home, I do not deem it to be
my place as Leader of the Opposition in
the Senate to indulge in recrimination and
narrow, bitter partisan criticism of what the
Government has done or proposes to do as
outlined in the Speech from the Throne.
The former administration was in office
for 22 years. It went through many crises,
and faced up to great and important issues.
No one can deny that it administered the
affairs of the country efficiently and with an
integrity which has never been questioned.
It gave outstanding leadership both at home
and abroad. Canada underwent a development
unprecedented in its history, and when the
time came for a change of Government the
administration which had been in power for
22 years turned over to the new administrataion a country whose economy was sound,
a country of untold natural resources, a peace
loving and industrious people living in economic conditions which were the envy of the
whole world.
We on this side of the house are just as
anxious to maintain that high standard as is
the Government itself, and so far as I am
concerned we will support all legislation
which has that end in view. In saying that,
I do not want the Leader of the Government
(Hon. Mr. Aseltine) to be under the misapprehension that we will blindly support
any and all Government legislation. Having
in mind, not political advantage but rather
the well-being of our fellow Canadians, I feel
I can say, that we of the Opposition will
examine thoroughly, even critically, all legislation which comes to this house. In fact,
in view of the unprecedented and overwhelming number of Government supporters in the
House of Commons, and of the small number

sitting in the Opposition in that house, I feel
that our responsibility in the Senate is greater
today than it ever has been.
Honourable senators, we must realize that
as a result of the last election there is only
one member of the official Opposition in the
other house who sits for a constituency west
of the western boundary of the province of
Ontario. In fact, there are only six members
sitting in opposition-five members of the
C.C.F. party and one Liberal-who represent
that part of Canada west of Ontario. Two
western provinces, Manitoba and Alberta,
have no representation whatsoever in the
Opposition. Likewise, from two eastern provinces, Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island,
there is not a single member sitting in the
Opposition. So, honourable senators, a very
large number of people who think as the
Opposition think-and we know how many
million people from all parts of Canada voted
for the Opposition-cannot make their voice
heard in the other place. I feel it is our duty
to have their voice heard, not in any narrow
partisan way, in this house. That imposes a
very great responsibility upon us.
We must be given the opportunity to discuss
legislation fully and freely in this chamber
and to have it examined minutely in committee. We should not hesitate, when we
think it is in the public interest to do so,
to amend it and to return it to the Commons
for its further consideration. It may happen
that this house will think it is in the interest
of the country to reject and to defeat completely legislation when it comes to this
house. In that respect I might state that
I have not changed from the stand which I
took last year when the present Government
took office. Since then it has been re-elected,
this time by an overwhelming and unprecedented popular vote. It has received a
general mandate to administer the affairs of
the country for the next five years and has
received a specific mandate in certain matters.
Where it is clear that the Government has
received a popular mandate and where there
are not the most compelling reasons for
believing that the issue should be referred
once again to the electorate, I do not think
the Senate will resist the adoption of any
such Government legislation. This is the
attitude which the Senate has traditionally
supported over the years.
Last fall when I spoke on the Address in
reply to the Speech frorn the Throne, shortly
after the present Government took office, I
went into this matter quite fully. I stand
four-square by what I said then. I will not
weary you by reading long excerpts frorn
my speech, but to clarify my position and
to leave no doubt as to my views I crave the
indulgence of the house while I quote briefly

MAY 22, 1958
from what I said at that time. This will be
found at page 37 of the Hansard of last
session:
I think that we would all do well to remember
that the Senate has not, traditionally, resisted the
adoption of any piece of Government legislation for
which a government has received a clear popular
mandate, whether as the result of a general election
or otherwise.
Nor would it, in my view, be
inclined to do so in future, in the absence of the
most compelling reasons for believing that the
issue should be referred once again to the
electorate.

Then I asked permission to quote what
the Right Honourable Arthur Meighen said
when he occupied the position similar to the
one I occupy at present. Here are his words:
Where there is a mandate for legislation which
comes before the Senate; where such legislation
was clearly discussed and placed on the platform
of the successful party in an election, then only
in most exceptional circumstances should there be
any attempt or desire on the part of the Upper
House to refuse to implement a mandate by its
concurring imprimatur. No one, however, who bas
thought the subject out can say that under no
circumstances should legislation coming to the
Senate from the Commons, though clearly supported
by a popular mandate in an election, fail of support
in the Second Chamber. It has been plainly and
tersely enunciated by Sir John Macdonald, by
George Brown and by Maritime statesmen, as well
as by Taché of Quebec, that the Senate's duty, or
one of its duties, is to see not only that wise
legislation, having for its purpose nothing but the
public good, is allowed, irrespective of mandate, to
become law, but in certain conceivable events to
see to it as well that the public of Canada, which
may at one election have endorsed extraordinary
proposals, has opportunity, if such proposals are of
a particularly dangerous or revolutionary character,
to think the subject over again; in a word, that the
Senate may, under certain circumstances, be
allowed to appeal from the "electorate of yesterday" to the "electorate of tomorrow".

Honourable senators, may I also be permitted to read a quotation taken from a
speech made on February 12, 1936, by the
late Senator Dandurand.
The framers of the Confederation intended this
chamber not to be a duplicate of the Commons
if we felt and acted as though we were, our
usefulness as a second chamber would be gone.
The Senate is not a duplicate of the House of
Commons. We stand above the sharp divisions of
party that exist in the other chamber, and we
approach all questions with a desire to do our
best for the general interest of the country.

Honourable senators, that is the position
which the Opposition takes at this time.
While on the question of legislation, I
trust that the Leader of the Government
will not, except in connection with interim
supply bills and under the most unusual circumstances requiring urgent legislative action,
ask us to give more than one reading to a
bill at one sitting. Nor will he ask us to
by-pass the committee stage of a bill. It is
in the committee stage that the Senate can
do its best work. There are those who
57075-4-6

would prefer that bills should go to a Committee of the Whole House rather than to a
standing committee. The great advantage
in sending a bill to a standing committee is
that the deputy minister and other departmental officials can be questioned directly
by senators, whereas in Committee of the
Whole the questions to the departmental
officials must be asked through the leader
or the senator who is in charge of the bill.
I do not think this is as satisfactory as
direct questions by senators to officials. That,
however, is a matter which the senators
must decide from time to time when a bill
has received second reading. My point is
that the committee stage should not be bypassed, but that we should be given an
opportunity when sitting in committee to
consider every bill which is presented to this
house.
Now, honourable senators, may I, without going into great detail, briefly touch on
three matters which are of great concern to
all Canadians, and are three of the most
important problems with which the ministry
must be concerned. In fact, I know the
Government is concerned about these matters.
In Canada today, in spite of the large
number of our fellow citizens who are
unemployed, we continue, generally speaking, to live in an era of general prosperity.
I am not discussing the question of whether
at the moment the number of unemployed
is 825,000 or 516,000. True, there are a
great many unemployed, but as I say, we are
at the same time living in an era of general
prosperity. In fact, we are becoming so
reckless with our prosperity that the cost
of living continues each month to set records
in its rapid climb upward, and this in turn
creates demands for increases in the price
of all goods and services. In other words,
we are caught in the midst of a dangerous
inflationary spiral which, if carried to
extremes, could not only stop our progress,
but would give us such a setback that the
high standard of living which we have
attained would not be reached again for
many decades.
We have seen what has happened in other
countries where inflation has become rampant, and it would be even more serious in
Canada, because we are a young country and
need large amounts of foreign capital to
develop our resources. This capital has been
coming in in large amounts during the past
ten years. Some think it has come in in too
large amounts. I am not going to discuss
that question at this time. I do say that if
our progress is not to be retarded we must
have large amounts of foreign capital to

and consistently
undertaken.
In view of the foregoing considerations and
on the basis of the experience gained in the
operation on an interim basis of the North
American Air Defence Command, my Government proposes that the following principles
should govern the future organization and
operations of the North American Air Defence
Command.
(1) The
Commander-in-Chief
NORAD
(CINCNORAD) will be responsible to the
Chiefs of Staff Committee of Canada and the

Joint Chiefs of Staff of the United States,
who in turn are responsible to their respective Governments. He will operate within a
concept of air defence approved by the appropriate authorities of our two Governments,
who will bear in mind their objectives in the
defence of the Canada-United States region
of the NATO area.
(2) The North American Air Defence Command will include such combat units and
individuals as are specifically allocated to it
by the two Governments. The jurisdiction of
the Commander-in-Chief, NORAD, over those
units and individuals is limited to operational control as hereinafter defined.
(3) "Operational Control" is the power to
direct, co-ordinate, and control the operational activities of forces assigned, attached
or otherwise made available. No permanent
changes of station would be made without
approval of the higher national authority
concerned. Temporary reinforcement from
one area to another, including the crossing
of the international boundary, to meet operational requirements will be within the
authority of commanders having operational
control. The basic command organization for
the air defence forces of the two countries,
including administration, discipline, internal
organization and unit training, shall be exercised by national commanders responsible
to their national authorities.
(4) The appointment of CINCNORAD and
his Deputy must be approved by the Canadian and United States Governments. They
will not be from the same country, and
CINCNORAD staff shall be an integrated
joint

staff

composed

of

officers

of

both

countries. During the absence of CINCNORAD, command will pass to the Deputy
Commander.
(5) The North Atlantic Treaty Organization
will continue to be kept informed through
the Canada-United States Regional Planning
Group of arrangements for the air defence
of North America.

(6) The plans and procedures to be followed by NORAD in wartime shall be formulated and approved in peacetime by
appropriate national authorities and shall be
capable of rapid implementation in an
emergency. Any plans or procedures recommended by NORAD which bear on the responsibilities of civilian departments or
agencies of the two Governments shall be
referred for decision by the appropriate military authorities to those agencies and departments and may be the subject of intergovernmental co-ordination.
(7) Terms of reference for CINCNORAD
and his Deputy will be consistent with the
foregoing principles. Changes in these terms
of reference may be made by agreement
between the Canadian Chiefs of Staff Committee and the United States Joint Chiefs of
Staff, with approval of higher authority as
appropriate, provided that these changes are
in consonance with the principles set out in
this Note.
(8) The question of the financing of
expenditures connected with the operation
of the integrated headquarters of the North
American Air Defence Command will be
settled by mutual agreement between
appropriate agencies of the two Governments.
(9) The North American Air Defence
Command shall be maintained in operation
for a period of ten years or such shorter
period as shall be agreed by both countries
in the light of their mutual defence interests,
and their objectives under the terms of the
North Atlantic Treaty. The terms of this
Agreement may be reviewed upon request
of either country at any time.
(10) The Agreement between parties to
the North Atlantic Treaty regarding the
status of their forces signed in London on
June 19, 1951, shall apply.
(11) The release to the public of information by CINCNORAD on matters of interest
to Canada and the United States of America
will in all cases be the subject of prior consultation and agreement between appropriate
agencies of the two Governments.
If the United States Government concurs
in the principles set out above, I propose
that this Note and your reply should constitute an Agreement between our two
Governments effective from the date of
your reply.
Accept, Sir, the renewed assurances of my
highest consideration.

Hon. Charles B. Howard presented Bill S-2,
respecting the Protective Association of
Canada.
Some Hon. Senalors: Explain.
The Hon. the Speaker: Will the honourable
senator please explain the bill?
Hon. Mr. Howard: Honourable senators,
this bill concerns a company that was incorporated in 1907 and has functioned successfully since that time. It has increased its
capital surplus and now, because of changed
conditions, it wishes to increase the benefits
obtainable under its operations. The association was originally formed as a Masonic assurance company, to provide sick and accident benefits. It wishes for no change as far
as coverage is concerned. The act was
amended so that the company could do
business outside of the Masonic Order, and
now it would like to increase the benefits
payable.
Bull read first time.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, when shall thîs bill be read the second
time?

MERCANTILE AND GENERAL REINSURANCE
COMPANY 0F CANADA LIMITEDFIRST READING

Hon. William R. Bruni presented Bill
S-3 respecting The Mercantile and General
Reinsurance Company of Canada Limited.
He said: Honourable seniators, this is a very
simple measure, since ail that the company
wishes to do is to increase its capitalization
from $1 million to $5 million so that it will
have additional capital available to cover
lasses and business expansion. This company,
as well as other insurance companies operatinig in Canada, has ex-perienced during the
past year extremely heavy losses, and it is
expected that losses will continue during this
year and part of next. In addition, the
company requires this additional capital as
its business has increased very materially
since its incorporation in 1951.
Hon. Mr. Euler: What kind of insurance
is it?
Hon. Mr. Bruni: Reinsurance only.
Bill read first time.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, when shail this bill be read the second

GOVEIRNMENT PUBLICATIONS
DISTRIBUTION TO MEMBERS 0F PARLIAMENT
-ANSWER TO INQUIRY

On the Orders of the Day:
Han. Thomas Reid: Honourable senators,
I would like to inquire of the honourable
Leader of the Government (Hon. Mr. Aseltine)
if he is in a position to give an answer to
the inquiry I presented as a question of
privilege on the 19th o! May.
Hon. W. M. Aselline: Honourable senators,
the honourable senator who has just spoken
was good enough to give me notice o! the
fact that hie was going to ask for an answer
today, so I have it ready for him.
For the information o! those who were
not here at the time, may I say that the
inquiry o! the honourable gentleman !rom
New Westminster (Hon. Mr. Reid) on May
19 had to do with the method by which
Governiment publications are distributed to
members o! Parliament. I assured him that
I would look into the matter, and accordingly
I wrote to the Queen's Printer and sent him
a copy of the Senate Hansard containing the
honourable gentleman's remarks.
The Queen's Printer has informed me that
the policy of his department in distributing
Government publications to senators and
members of the House of Commons is laid

SENATE
down in Treasury Board Minute No.
477983, passed on March 31, 1955. The main
feature of this regulation is that no free distribution of any Government publication is
made by the Queen's Printer except as
provided in the regulation itself. The part
of the regulation covering members of the
Senate and the House of Commons reads
as follows:
One copy of the same current Government
publications shall be sent on application, without
charge, to persons and institutions as follows,
provided that requests are made within 10 days
following the receipt of check lists:
(a) Senators and members of the Parliament of
Canada;
(b) Ministers of the Government of Canada and
their Parliamentary Assistants . . .

With the opening of each Parliament and
each session of Parliament, every member
of the Senate and House of Commons is reminded by departmental circular letter of
the existence of the Queen's Printer's daily
check list, the reasons for its issuance and
the method by which official publications can
be obtained free of charge.
The purpose of the daily list service is:
(a) to inform members of both houses within
the shortest possible time of the availability
of publications; and (b) to prevent wasteful
distribution by giving them the opportunity
of ordering only those publications they wish
to receive.
The Queen's Printer, in the distribution of
Government publications, is bound to observe
the regulations as established by the Treasury
Board. If the regulations are working a hardship on any honourable member, the Joint
Committee on the Printing of Parliament
could take the matter up, with a view to
making representations to the proper authority to have the regulations amended to provide for distribution at the request of
honourable members.
Honourable senators, I have quite a file
here, and the honourable senator from New
Westminster may have access to it in order

to read over these orders and regulations, if
he wishes to do so. I notice that he is not a
member of the Joint Committee on Printing
of Parliament, but there are two vacancies,
and if he would like to become a member of
the committee I have no doubt it could be
arranged. He could then take his case up
with the committee when it meets and do his
best to have the committee send representations to the proper authorities.
Hon. Mr. Reid: I have a further question
to ask. Before doing so, however, I wish to
continue my question of privilege, and first
of all to say that I am rather disappointed,
for I could have written to the Queen's
Printer myself and received the self-same

answer. I am now beginning to witness something that I thought might happen because
we have no representative from the cabinet
in the Senate. If we had a member of the
cabinet present, he could bring the order in
council to the cabinet's attention and urge
that it be amended so as to protect the rights
of honourable senators. I think it well worth
while to take that matter seriously.
The question I wish to ask is with respect
to the daily lists the honourable leader mentioned. It so happens that two of the requests
I made were for publications issued eight
years ago, before ever the order in council
was passed, and they have nothing at all to
do with the daily lists.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: This refers to current
publications.
Hon. Mr. Reid: I am not referring to current publications. The publications I refer
to were published many years ago, and I
required them for the carrying out of my
duties.
I am appealing to the honourable leader
to place this matter before the Government,
because it does affect the rights both of this
house and the other house. If a senator
were away from home, or were sick, he might
not check one of the daily lists, and two or
three weeks later he might be requested for
information on a certain subject, and upon

sending for a publication he might be told,
"You are not to have it unless you pay for it,
because you did not mark it on the list". I
believe this affects the rights and privileges
of every member. I know the order in
council was passed, but I think the honourable
leader of the Senate should have taken up
the matter with higher quarters, rather than
with the Queen's Printer.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Honourable senators,
perhaps I am showing my ignorance in asking a question that occurs to me. My honourable friend from New Westminster (Hon.
Mr. Reid) asked about an order in council,
and the Leader of the Government (Hon. Mr.
Aseltine) called it an order of the Treasury
Board. May I ask by what authority the
Treasury Board is able to make an order of
this kind affecting the members of the Senate
and the House of Commons?
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: I have a complicated
document here, consisting of six pages, being
an extract from the minutes of a meeting of
the Treasury Board, held at Ottawa, March
31, 1955. Apparently the Treasury Board
has the right to make regulations in accordance with section 7 of the Public Printing
and Stationery Act and a section of the
Financial Administration Act relating to the

MAY 27, 1958
distribution of Government publications. The
document gives the regulations made under
that authority.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Thank you.

mind goes back over fifty years to Christmas
1903 when I went first to the Prairie provinces to teach school from the old historie
town of Perth, in Lanark county, Ontario,
where I received most of my early education.
I was fortunate in having been brought up
in a community where good fishing was available and where many sports such as curling,
hockey and lacrosse were played; these activities I followed later when I left Ontario
and went to Manitoba and on to the western
plains.

in the front row where the honourable gentleman for Kennebec (Hon. Mr. Vaillancourt)
sits now. During all that time, and while he
was Leader of the Government, I gave him
the best advice and co-operation I could, and
I am sure that he will give us the best advice
and co-operation in his power.
Next I would like to say a few words about
how much I enjoyed the address of the mover
(Hon. Mr. Monette) and the seconder (Hon.
Mr. Thorvaldson) of the Address. I think
honourable senators will agree that the speech
of the mover was one of the best speeches
in French we have heard in this chamber
in recent years.

MAY 27, 1958
the little school frequently built by the hands
of the settlers themselves even before school
districts had been set up, and there they grew
to love their new country, learn the English
language, and dream as their fathers had of
the future of this great new land of freedom.
As you know, it was in this land that our
present Prime Minister had his early life and
where was born that great dream of his
about the unity of Canada and the rights of
all men, no matter how humble might be
their origin, to be looked upon and treated
not only as free men but as Canadians. The
first speech be made in Parliament, on the
13th day of June, 1940, was on that very
theme. He repeated remarks of a similar
nature on the llth day of August, 1944, and
quite recently be reiterated his stand on
unity, freedom and Canadianism in a reported interview in Maclean's magazine.
And I think that in this house, where we
are in a special sense the guardians of the
minority rights in this great land, it is now
a great thing for Canada that we have not
only members of the French and English
races, but also descendants from many other
nationalities; and that recently, in his dream
of the unity of Canada, the Prime Minister
has seen fit to summon a first Canadian of
Icelandic descent, and also the first representative of that first race which owned all of
this land before we came, the honourable
gentleman with the noble name of Gladstone
who comes from the province of Alberta.
Hon. Senators:

Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: In line with the Prime
Minister's dream of unity, I should like to
give you now some information with respect
to the make-up of the Conservative membership of the House of Commons at this time.
Of those born outside Canada, four were born
in England, five in the United States, two in
Scotland, one in Russia-in the Crimea-one
in the Ukraine, one in New Zealand. Of
Canadian-born members there is one of
Chinese origin, one of Italian origin, and one,
like our own Senator Thorvaldson, of Icelandic origin; there are four-one of them the
Minister of Labour-of Ukrainian descent,
one of Polish descent, four of German descent,
and one of Norwegian descent. I think it Is
a fine thing that so many races and nationalities are at this time represented in our
Parliament.
I listened with great interest to the honourable Leader of the Opposition (Hon. Mr.
Macdonald) who preceded me. He talked
about the functions of this house and expounded its legal rights and the necessity for
the independent exercise of its functions. I
agree with most of what he said. I too came
into this house almost a quarter of a century

ago. At that time my party, the Conservative,
had a great majority, but during the long
reign of power of the Liberals the grim harvester diminished our numbers until we were
reduced almost to half a dozen. We were a
little band of Conservative brothers in a vast
sea of Liberal appointees who almost dwarfed
us to insignificance as far as numbers were
concerned. However, I know that the funetions of this bouse will be properly exercised
even though it is preponderately representative of a party opposed to the Government.
There has always been a spirit of co-operation
in this house, dominated and guided by a
breadth of understanding and wisdom which
has hardly ever narrowed itself to party lines;
and I hope and expect that it will so continue.
This chamber is the peculiar guardian of the
spirit of Confederation, the spirit that dominated Sir John A. Macdonald, Cartier and
Brown, that there would be a Parliament
conceived in the spirit of unity which would
overcome all the disadvantages of difference
of race, religion and language by the glorious
conception, which bas abided, that men could
be free in Canada and still unite to make and
foster a great nation.
I would be insensible, honourable senators,
if I did not express here, without any mental
reservations whatsoever, my personal gratitude for the spirit of co-operation which bas
been evidenced by all the members of this
Senate in their statements of good will and
the desire to assist me in the performance of
my difficult task as Leader of the Government in this chamber. I know that we cooperated when you were a little band of few,
and I expect that this spirit of co-operation
will still abide, and that this honourable
chamber will continue to function as guardian
of the liberty and the welfare of the Canadian people. Our function above all others is
to maintain the rule of law even in these
parlous and perilous times when it might
appear to some, though it will never happen
here, that the rule of the tyrant might overcome the spirit of freedom.
There are many members of this chamber
who are not only learned in the law but
have vast experience in business, finance,
labour, education, culture and other fields. I
bespeak, honourable senators, your advice,
your assistance and your co-operation.
I want to assure the honourable Leader
of the Opposition that I shall use my best
endeavours at all times to have introduced
in this chamber as many bills as possible,
but, as be so well said on Thursday last,
the greater part of the prospective legislation to come before Parliament at this session
has to do with money bills, and consequently
must be introduced in the first instance in
the other 'place. However, every opportunity

SENATE
will be given to debate and consider these
measures, and I propose, whenever possible
and expedient, to refer the same to the appropriate standing committees where ministers, departmental officials and others can
attend and give information.
I have prepared a brief on the question of
making a cursory explanation of a bill after
its first reading and before it is placed on the
Order Paper for second reading. I had intended to read, for the benefit of honourable
senators who were not present last Thursday,
a paragraph of the speech of the honourable
Leader of the Opposition dealing with this
matter; but it is quite a long paragraph so I
think I shall leave it out and just go on with
my remarks.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Dispense!
Hon. Mr. Aselline: In the Senate, as in the
House of Lords of Great Britain, it is not
necessary to give notice or ask leave to bring
in a bill. Senate Rules 61 and 62 deal with
the introduction and first reading of bills in
this house. The heading preceding these rules
is "Public Bills", but the only difference between public bills and private bills in this
respect is that a private bill is introduced
after a petition has been favourably reported
on by the Committee on Standing Orders or
the Examiner of Petitions. The bill is then
introduced and immediately given first reading. It is important to stress the difference
in this respect between the proceedings in
the House of Commons and the proceedings
in the Senate, namely, that in the Senate it is
not necessary to ask leave to bring in the bill,
whereas in the House of Commons every bill
is introduced upon motion for leave to introduce it.
Rule 71 of the Rules of the House of Commons reads as follows:
71. (1) Every bill is introduced upon motion for
leave, specifying the title of the bill; or upon
motion to appoint a committee to prepare and
bring i in.
(2) A motion for leave to introduce a bill shall
be decided without debate or amendment, provided that any member moving for such leave may
be permitted to give a succinct explanation of the
provisions of the said bill.

The accent is on the word "may". It is not
compulsory. Honourable senators will notice
that subsection (2) of this rule provides that
any member moving for leave to introduce
a bill may be permitted to give a succinct
explanation of the provisions of the bill. The
giving of this explanation is not mandatory,
but permissive.
I would like to refer now to Beauchesne's
Parliamentary Rules and Forms, Fourth Edition, at page 270, where it is stated that at
this stage only such succinct explanation is
generally given as will enable the house to

understand the purport of the bill. He points
out that this is not the time for a debate on
the merits and that debate should be avoided
at this stage. He gives examples on pages 270
and 271 of cases in which this leave to introduce a bill was not granted, and the reasons
therefor. These illustrations, however, are of
no value in the Senate, because in this house
a senator introduces a bill as of right and he
does not require any leave to proceed, nor do
the rules of the House of Commons or the
Senate require an explanation to be given on
first reading of a bill.
Quite frequently when bills come to this
chamber from the other place the Leader of
the Government in the Senate introduces
them and they are given first reading. Then
the carrying of the bill from that point on,
through second reading, through committee
and through third reading is done by one of
his honourable colleagues. I am doubtful of
the advisability of having the Leader of the
Government, when he introduces a bill, giving
a short explanation of it and then having the
honourable senator who carries the bill from
that time on give another explanation on
second reading. There could be a conflict. I
do not know that I would be in favour of
amending our rules or following that practice.
It seems to me that the procedure we have
followed in the past has worked very well,
and I hope it will be continued.
Honourable senators, coming as I do from
the great wheat-producing province of
Saskatchewan I think I should say something
about wheat. I do not suppose I have made
many speeches in this chamber without saying something about this product. The situation in so far as grain is concerned,
particularly in Saskatchewan, which is the
greatest wheat-growing province of ail, is
that we still have quite a quantity of unmarketed wheat and other grains stored on
our farms. The wheat is safely stored and
we expect to get rid of it eventually. There
is some encouragement in the latest figures
handed down by the Bureau of Statistics,
which disclose that Canada's wheat exports
rose to a five-year high in the first eight
months of the current crop year. According
to a report issued by the Bureau, Canada's
exports rose to 193,600,000 bushels, which
was an increase of 17,700,000 bushels over
last year. It represents the highest figure for
the same period of eight months since 195253, when we exported 224,700,000 bushels.
These figures do not include gifts of wheat
recently shipped to India, Pakistan and
Ceylon. It is expected that, as sales are
at present encouraging, Canada's total exports
for the crop year ending July 31, 1958, will

MAY 27, 1958
total 300 million bushels, which was the figure mentioned last fall when I introduced
the measure providing for cash advances on
farm-stored grain.
Perhaps at this time I should take a minute
to give some information on the total advances made to date under that bill. We
thought at that time they might run to $125
million or $150 million, but the total is only
$35,145,000, of which $20,230,000 has been
refunded or collected back, leaving outstanding $15 million. The maximum advance under the legislation was $3,000 but the average
advance was only $700.
Honourable senators, I had intended to say
something about northern development and
perhaps I still have time.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Yes.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Yes, go ahead.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: When I was a young
fellow living in the Ottawa Valley-in Lanark
County, Ontario-we heard a great deal of
the West. It was being developed very
rapidly, and the slogan at that time was "Go
West, young man." Well, after some fifty
or sixty years the situation has changed considerably. The West is rather fully developed,
and the agricultural land has been taken up
and brought under cultivation. There are not
so many advantages to be obtained by a
young man going West now as there were
then. In fact, a great many of our young
men in the West find that coming East to
the provinces of Ontario and Quebec is the
thing to do. They have a better chance to
get along down here than they have in the
West because the land there has all been
taken up. It is my opinion that with the
Government's northern development program
in full swing the slogan henceforth will be
"Go North, young man."
Honourable senators will remember that
Canada's first national development policy
was that of Sir John A. Macdonald, who
fathered the building of the Canadian Pacific
Railway and other communications linking
the East with the West. He had great vision,
faith and confidence in the great Northwest,
which resulted in the opening of that vast
territory for settlement.
Now we have our present Prime Minister
coming forward with another national
development policy, namely, the opening up
of another vast territory lying to the north
of the 60th parallel of latitude, principally
concerned with that part of Canada lying
to the north of the provinces of Manitoba,
Saskatchewan, Alberta and British Columbia.
It comprises in area about 40 per cent of
the total.
Honourable senators, in my opinion, the
Canadian north is one of the last great

undeveloped regions of the globe. I have
always been interested in the far north
territory, and have on occasion made speeches
in connection with bills introduced in this
chamber dealing with that part of Canada.
I believe that the honourable senior senator
from Winnipeg (Hon. Mr. Haig), and later
on I myself, made speeches suggesting that
the lands north of each of the four western
provinces should be given to those provinces
by extending their present boundaries
as far north as the Arctic Ocean, or
as far as the Arctic Islands, but that suggestion did not seem to meet with the approval of the inhabitants, and nothing was
done about it.
I do not intend to go into this matter any
further at the present time, but simply to
say that about $450 million of new wealth
has been created by oil alone in the West
and Northwest. There is oil in the north
also-about 25 million acres have been leased
for exploration already. Oil companies will
spend some $25 million on exploration
alone. If honourable senators are interested
in northern development, I would refer them
to the lecture given by R. G. Robertson,
Commissioner of the Northwest Territories
on The New North, delivered at Carleton
University, Ottawa, on November 16 last.
In addition to oil, we know that there are
some millions of acres of arable land in the
Yukon and Mackenzie River Valley, and
also extensive forests in the Mackenzie
Valley going farther north than the Arctic
Circle, which are of commercial value and
are beginning to be used. There are also
commercial fisheries, and untold mineral
resources which geologists tell us include
all minerals known to man. The policy of the
Government is to open up this great territory
for development.
Honourable senators, I thought I should
say something about the South Saskatchewan
River dam, which has been a political football with us for many years.
Some Hon. Senators: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. Howard: Which side are you on
now?
Hon. Mr. Aselline: I am pleased that the
people of Canada have now satisfied themselves that this is an important work to be
done, giving us in that part of Saskatchewan
a great central park, a lot of hydro-electric
power, and irrigation of countless acres. We
are pleased that approval has been given to
this project which will be started this year.
I believe that in the estimates a certain
amount of money has been allocated for that
purpose. I know it is a project that is very
dear to the heart of the Prime Minister, who,

SENATE
like myself, is a product of the Saskatchewan
prairies, and who I believe taught school in
certain areas near Saskatoon.
I have just one concluding sentence: All
in all, the Government program outlined in
the Speech from the Throne may well be
the most exciting and constructive in Canada's history.
Hon. F. W. Gershaw: Honourable senators,
may I first of all compliment the mover (Hon.
Mr. Monette) and the seconder (Hon. Mr.
Thorvaldson) on the eloquence of their addresses.
I also wish to compliment you, Mr. Speaker,
on your splendid accomplishments. In addition, I wish in a very humble way to extend
my hearty welcome to the new members
of this Senate chamber; I hope they will take
part in the work of the Senate and that they
will find happiness here and an opportunity
to make a contribution to the work of the
Senate. May I also compliment the Leader
of the Government in the Senate (Hon. Mr.
Aseltine) on his appointment, and especially
compliment him on the splendid speech he
bas just delivered.
In the Speech from the Throne appears a
sentence which reads as follows:
To promote and guide the proper long-term
developnent of our National Capital region upon
lines worthy of our nation, my Government will
request you to enact a new National Capital Act
to replace the present Federal District Commission
Act.

There are many organizations in connection
with the Federal District Commission, involving the province of Ontario, the province of
Quebec, the city of Ottawa and a great many
municipalities. The Federal District Commission bas had difficulties in harmonizing
so many diverse views. I hope there will be
co-operation among the various bodies, and
that it will always be remembered that the
Federal District contribution comes from the
taxpayers of Canada as a whole. It has been
suggested many times that here in Ottawa we
should have a Federal District like there is
at Washington, but the information that was
given before the committee which was set up
to inquire into the matter was that such a
plan was not altogether satisfactory to the
people of the District of Columbia or to the
United States Government. People like to
have the right of voting and to have a say
in their local affairs; but the people of the
District of Columbia have not the right to
vote, although they are not relieved from
paying taxes. In 1956 the budget amounted to
$181 million, $18 million of which was supplied by Washington, and the people of the
district had to contribute the rest. The unenfranchised people had to contribute 90 per
cent of the budget, and in fact Washington
does not contribute to the District any more

proportionately than the Dominion Government here contributes to the City of Ottawa.
District of Columbia people have had to pay
taxes on securities and bonds, cigarettes and
soft drinks, and almost everything they have.
Hon. Mr. Quinn: Taxation without representation.
Hon. Mr. Gershaw: Yes. To make up this
amount it becomes necessary to impose such
taxes. Then again, the business affairs are
largely run by three federal commissioners,
two appointed by the President and the third
loaned from an engineering organization. In
addition there is a Public School Board,
Public Utilities Commission, Police Board,
Public Library Board, and quite a number of
others, and the people have no say whatever
in who shall make up the boards. That is not
likely to occur here.
Upper Canada and Lower Canada united
in 1840, and the legislative sessions in that
period were held alternately in Montreal
and Toronto. This was not very satisfactory.
There were often fires, raids and disasters.
In fact, the picture of Queen Victoria which
hangs just outside the doors of this chamber
was rescued three times from disaster.
Now, the name Ottawa seems to have been
taken from an Indian word which means
Men of the Forests. Men of the forests from
time immemorial came down the Ottawa
river, with painted faces, and garbed in skins
of animals; they came in birch bark canoes
heavily laden in spring with furs. These furs
were sold to Eastern tribes, and in more
recent times to the Hudson Bay and the
Northwest companies. Queen Victoria in
1857 chose Ottawa as the capital of this
country, and that choice, of course, was confirmed by Confederation in 1867. The city
has continued, however, to be a self-governing municipality under the province of
Ontario. In the early days Crown property
was not taxable, and in 1877, owing to the
increase in a number of buildings, small
amounts of money were given by the Dominion to the city of Ottawa for sidewalks,
roads, for water supplied to Government
buildings. And then along about 1909 it was
found that more assistance was needed by the
municipality, so a grant to the city of $30,000
a year was arranged for. This went on until
about 1925 when the situation, becoming
more desperate, with many more buildings
and so on, that it was then arranged that
the city would get $100,000 a year.
This continued until about 1943, when the
grant was raised to $200,000, and the next
year to $300,000. Then in 1949 the Municipal
Grants Act came into force, with $400,000 as
the first grant, which was rapidly increased to

MAY 27, 1958
$2,750,000; and this year, according to newspapers, the city is going to get $3 million.
-Now, in order to carry on the great work
of making the capital worthy of the nation
different commissions have been appointed.
In 1899, the Ottawa Improvement Commission was appointed. That commission, which
was given $60,000 a year, carried on for a
long time, but by 1927 it was found that its
activities were too much restricted and its
financing altogether inadequate, so the Federal District Commission was set up. That
commission was granted $250,000 a year-at
least that was the arrangement in 1927. The
next year some $3 million was put into the
capital account of the commission and the
annual grant was cut down to $200,000. That,
of course, has been increased since then. The
Federal District Commission is almost a
Crown company under the cabinet, with a
very long history. At the present time it
receives an annual grant of $300,000. It gets
about $111,000 as a supplementary allowance, and $113,000 for looking after the
grounds around the Government buildings
throughout the city of Ottawa. The commission gets something like $255,000 from rentals
of property, and of course with that money
it acquires land, looks after parks and parkways, employs and pays a large staff, purchases machinery and different things of that
kind, and of course maintains an engineering
department.
I wish to pay a tribute to the Federal
District Commission for carrying on under
great difficulty. That was made clear at the
hearings of the Joint Committee of this
house and the House of Commons which was
set up in 1956. The committee received many
dozens of memoranda, sat day after day and
week after week listening to witnesses, ail
with divergent ideas, and it had a hard time
in harmonizing ail those ideas. The Federal
District Commission consists of 20 members,
one from each of the 10 provinces of Canada,
two from the city of Ottawa, one from the
city of Hull and the others from the surrounding municipalities.
The foundation of Ottawa dates from 1826
when the Rideau Canal was built. In 1832
Colonel By secured a grant of land for the
Crown, and our Parliament Buildings are
now located on that land. In 1903 F. G. Todd,
a landscape architect, drew plans. for parks
and parkways in this city, and those plans
have been used as a guide ever since. In
1913 the Holt Commission reported on the
relocation of railway lines and recommended
acquisition of Gatineau Park.
But the chief investigation and the master
plan came in 1945 or 1946, when Jacques
Greber made his report. It dealt with such
things as uniformity in public buildings, the

Queensway, the rural fringe, parks and parkways, the railways and particularly with pollution in the Ottawa River.
The Queensway has been recommended by
the Greber Commission, the City of Ottawa
and the National Capital Planning Committee,
which is an advisory board. It is to be a
speedway 10 miles long through the city.
Highway No. 17 will be diverted into the
city at Green's Creek, cross the Rideau River
at Hurdman's Bridge, cross the canal, and
continue west, crossing Carling and Bronson
Avenues, along the route of the crosstown
tracks of the Canadian National Railways.
The Queensway is a dominion-provincialmunicipal undertaking that will cost about
$31 million. There will be along its route
subways, bridges and cloverleaves. While of
course a speed limit will be imposed, construction of this throughway will reduce traffic congestion in Confederation Square. Land
is being acquired now for this highway.
Then there is the green belt, which we have
heard a lot about lately. It has been said to
be up to the Prime Minister entirely, but I
think this is hardly a correct statement of the
situation, because there are other parties
involved. The green belt is simply a perimeter or rural fringe, about two to four miles
wide, which will extend right around the
urban district of Ottawa and Hull. It will not
be just a swamp, vacant land, scrub, or anything of that kind. In it will be located
churches, hospitals and schools, golf courses
and landing fields, parks, and farms. There
may be some homes, built on, say, 5j acres
of land, but there will not be a large number
of houses that will need to be serviced with
facilities, and there will not be any slum
areas. Roads will run through this rural
fringe so that people living in towns and villages outside may have easy access to the city.
The green belt will be an advantage to
Ottawa, because it will eliminate the necessity of indefinite expansion of the city's public
utilities. With utilities there is such a thing
as an economic unit: the utilities will supply
so much, and their capacity can only be expanded at great cost. This rural fringe will
limit the urban area to 44,000 acres and its
population to something like half a million.
This will be of great advantage to Canada
also, because if the metropolitan area is
allowed to expand indefinitely there will be
no limit to federal involvement.
The farmers living in the green belt area
have for a long time been uncertain as to
what was to become of their farms.
Municipalities have been worried about what
is to become of their areas. So, it is a matter
of urgency and one in which I hope there
will be full co-operation.

SENATE
The matter of re-routing the railways is
another big part of the plan. It was originally
intended that the Union Station would be
moved out to the Southeast of the city, but
it appears that will not happen in our time.
The city of Ottawa is divided into nine parts
by railways and waterways; the city of
Hull is divided into approximately four
parts. It is said that the re-routing of the
railway lines would have an esthetic as well
as an economic effect. The Federal District
Commission will construct the new Walkley
facilities in return for the abandoned right
of way of the Canadian National Railways
crosstown tracks. It is hoped of course
that a railway terminal company will be
established to facilitate operation of trains
into the city of Ottawa.
So, honourable senators, this one activity,
which was recommended by Sir Herbert Holt
in 1913, is going to prove of great value. The
parks and parkways which were first recommended by Mr. Todd, back in 1903, are
equally valuable. We now have 22 miles of
scenic highways under the Federal District
Commission, and some 900 acres of parkland.
These scenic highways lead through the most
beautiful part of the city, where there are
gardens and flowering shrubs, and where is
given a view of the waterfronts of both the
Otta'wa River and the Rideau River.
Hogs Back Park, some four miles to the
south of the Parliament Buildings, adds about
170 acres to the 900 acres of parkland. It is
a beautiful spot, with sanitary facilities and
picnic grounds, and on hot days in the summer it is visited by thousands of people.
The Gatineau Park is a large triangular
area northwest of the city which Sir Herbert
Holt recommended should be part of the
National Capital Plan, and steps have been
taken to make it so. A driveway 45 miles
long has been established through this area,
along which there are four look-out points
where a panoramic view of the hills and
valleys, lakes and streams can be had. There
is parking space where 580 cars may be accommodated without detracting from the
scenery, and there are four well equipped
picnic grounds with all the necessary
facilities. This will be a recreation place
for the people of Ottawa and for tourists
who visit this part of Canada.
The Commission has already acquired
50,000 of the 75,000 acres necessary for the
Gatineau Park system. This area can be
used in the winter for skiing and other
winter sports, and in the summer for bathing, boating, picnicking and other activities.
I now come to the last subject which I
wish to discuss this evening, that of pollution
in the Ottawa River. Cities everywhere are
built on running streams or large bodies of

water, and sewage and industrial waste from
those cities find its way into the water.
May I say very definitely, honourable senators, that all public health authorities and
medical text books say that water polluted by
sewage is dangerous: it is dangerous because
it carries the germs of typhoid, cholera,
dysentry, gastric disorders, and in particular
infective hepatitis, which is often not recognized. These diseases can of course be easily
acquired by drinking the water, but they can
also be acquired by swimming and bathing
in it; the germs get on the skin and find their
way into the intestinal canal. During the
years between 1938 and 1943 some 327 waterborne epidemics were experienced in Canada
and in the United States. The damage is
measured by the biochemical oxygen demand;
that is, the organic waste or sewage decomposes, uses up the oxygen, and many
thousands of fish have apparently died in the
Ottawa River from this very cause. There is
a limit to the permissible amount of sewage
in any stream.
A river tends to purify itself, if there is
sufficient volume of water. At one place in
the Illinois River, for instance, there were
1,100,000 organisms in a measured quantity
of water, while 261 miles further down stream
there were only 13,000 in a similar quantity,
a relatively harmless amount. There the
water was about as pure as it could be made
by treatment. This purification is accomplished by aeration when a large volume of
water flows over a long distance.
The same purification process takes place
to some extent in the Ottawa River; but with
the industrial waste and sewage from such
places as Timiskaming, Petawawa, Renfrew,
Pembroke and Hawkesbury coming into the
river the water does not purify itself because
there is not sufficient volume flowing a long
enough distance to enable it to do so.
It should be said that the paper mills and
towns have been co-operative, but in some
places the BOD was 250 per million, when
it should have been about 15.
In addition to the decomposition of organic
matter, there is the bacterial pollution which
of course is the most dangerous. We well
remember a time when Winnipeg's water
supply was taken from one river, and then
for some reason, water was taken from another river. The water supply went along a
certain avenue in that city where hundreds
of cases of typhoid developed. The infection
was traced up the Assiniboine River to a
settler's home where there were several cases
of typhoid, and refuse was being dumped into
the river, thus causing this serious outbreak.
As regards bacterial pollution, 2,400 is the
figure usually considered safe. That figure
is sometimes found in the waters of the

MAY 27, 1958
Ottawa River above the Chaudiere Falls,
where the city gets its water supply, but in
other places on the Ottawa River the figures
go as high as 16,000 and 24,000, and even up
to 54,000. The place of gross pollution is
between Chaudiere Falls and Green Creek,
where the sewage enters the river.
Long experience has shown that it is possible to make water safe, and everyone
seems to be agreed that something should
be done in connection with the Ottawa
River. Many delays have taken place: first
the plan was delayed because of the First
World War, then because of the depression,
and later it was delayed because of the
Second World War. The Gore and Storie
Report estimated. that a treatment plant could
have been built for $22 million or $23 million; the figure now given for such a plant
is $43 million. There has lately been a good
deal of activity and investigation in this
respect. A site has been secured for a sewage treatment plant.
I should like, honourable senators, to read
two recommendations by the Ontario Department of Health, 1956, as follows:

which sat in 1956 to consider this problem.
This bill will remove some of the uncertainties about expropriation of property.
There was some doubt as to whether expropriation proceedings could be taken for
park purposes, but this has been cleared up.
It would seem, however, that the committee
which sat in 1944, and again in 1956, might
meet a little oftener, so that people would
have a rather better idea of what is being
done. Along this line it has occurred to me
that if the National Capital Commission, instead of being a creation reporting to the
cabinet, were to report to Parliament, and,
instead of receiving statutory grants, were
to have its estimates approved by Parliament, all Canada would know more of what
is going on.
The object of the master plan, honourable
senators, is not by any means to try to make
this capital area the Washington of the
North, or the Rome of the New World, but
rather to relate the design to the natural
surroundings, to preserve unimpaired the
charm and beauty of the Ottawa Valley.

SPEECH FROM THE THRONE
MOTION

FOR ADDRESS IN REPLYDEBATE CONTINUED

The Senate resumed from yesterday consideration of His Excellency the Governor
General's Speech at the opening of the session, and the motion of Hon. Mr. Monette,
seconded by Hon. Mr. Thorvaldson, for an
Address in reply thereto.
Hon. Wishar± McL. Robertson: Honourable

senators, the honourable Leader of the
Opposition (Hon. Mr. Macdonald) has referred to the new senators and to the mover
and seconder of the Address in reply to the
Speech from the Throne in such appropriate
terms that there is little I can do but express

my entire approval of what he said. As was
expected, both the mover and seconder performed their duties excellently. Their subject-matter was good, their delivery excellent.
I join with the honourable Leader of the
Opposition in welcoming the new senators
to this house. They represent different portions of Canada. I am sure they have from
us all a very warm welcome.

I hoped to extend to His Honour the
Speaker of the Senate personally my congratulations upon his continuance in office;
but I would ask you, Mr. Acting Speaker,
to convey my best wishes to him in his further occupancy of a position he so richly
deserves. His conduct, I believe, has commended itself to all members of this house.
I cannot but feel a tinge of regret that the
Honourable Senator Haig felt that the duties
of Leader of the Government in the Senate
were such that he should tender his resignation. He has rendered long and distinguished
service in this house. Now that his party,
which he has enthusiastically supported for
so long, is firmly entrenched in office, I personally would have hoped he might have felt
equal to carrying on the responsibilities of
Government Leader in this house for a year
more. However, he knows his own capacities
best. I want to say that he has my best
wishes for a long and happy life. Senator
Haig and I have much in common. During
most of the eight-year period when I had the
honour to be Leader of the Government in
the Senate the honourable gentleman was
Leader of the Opposition here. From time to
time it was necessary for us to differ on
matters of policy in respect to legislation
that came before the house, but nothing at
any time interfered in any way, shape or
form with our friendship.
When Senator Haig felt he should lay aside
the responsibilities of Government Leader
in the Senate I am sure every member of
this house received with great pleasure the
news that the Prime Minister chose the
Honourable Senator Aseltine as the new
leader. Senator Aseltine is one of the veteran
members of the Senate and has distinguished
himself in all phases of our activities. He
has been a faithful attendant of the Senate
and an energetic worker in committees, in
which he has laboured hard and long. His
appointment as Government Leader in this
house is a good one, and I am sure he has
the best wishes of every honourable senator
on my side of the chamber.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: I would like to say

a word of congratulations to the honourable
senators opposite as a result of the recent
election which they and their Prime Minister
won. I do not suppose I intentionally did
very much to help them secure their victory,
but I think it was an outstanding event in
Canada's political history, and I want to compliment them, and the Prime Minister in
particular, on the dramatic, decisive and
amazing results. I would say, moreover, that
the victory was all the more remarkable,
because in the process of achieving it they

MAY 28, 1958
defeated the best Government Canada ever
had, and one whose record was unsurpassed
anywhere. Under the administration of Mr.
King and Mr. St. Laurent, through war and
peace Canada attained a new stature in the
eyes of the world. By sound, progressive
and far-sighted action, they created the atmosphere in which Canadians attained an
unparalleled prosperity; they laid the foundation of this prosperity in selecting finance
ministers who lived up to the best Liberal
traditions. Ilsley, Abbott and Harris proved
worthy successors of Fielding, Robb and
Dunning. They made sound governmental
finance the keystone of their administrations,
thereby creating business confidence and encouraging investors both from domestic and
external sources. They strove unceasingly
to aid in providing markets for our great
export industries, and as and when the finances of the country permitted they reduced
taxes until our income tax was lower than
that of any other country with like obligations. By a new basis of federal-provincial
fiscal relations and new and increased social
security benefits they provided that the rapidly rising national income was distributed
fairly geographically and to all classes of
society. But what to my mind was the greatest accomplishment of all was that during
periods of great inflationary pressures they
acted courageously and successfully in minimizing the effect of those inflationary pressures on the cost of living, thereby preventing
the consumer from having his pockets picked.
Realizing the inflationary effects of huge
capital programs from private sources being
superimposed on tremendous expenditure for
armaments, they kept other governmental
expenditures to the minimum. They set up
large reserves against our indirect obligations
and against the expenditures that had been
capitalized. They paid off the national debt
until it was reduced by almost $3 billion
from what it was at the end of World War
II. In the very last budget that Mr. Harris
presented to Parliament he again warned of
the dangers of inflation and resolutely stood
against increased governmental expenditures.
He again pointed out that it did not make
sense to increase government disbursements
and reduce taxes with one hand, and take
away the resulting benefits that would flow
from these expenditures with the other by
increased cost of living. He was criticized
and ridiculed for not loosening his hold on
the money bags of the nation, but he stood
firm even in the face of a general election.
He got scant credit and little praise for his
courageous action, but he has mine, humble
though it may be. I figuratively take off my
hat to him for what he did. If it did not
pay dividends as far as votes were concerned

it certainly did in keeping down the cost of
living, particularly to those in humble circumstances. For the five-year period ending
1956 the consumers' price index remained
relatively steady, increasing only by a yearly
average of three-tenths of one point for the
whole period. That is indeed in all conscience
too much of an increase, but amazingly
little in the light of subsequent developments.
I am proud of having supported a Government with such courage; and may I say in
passing that the time is rapidly approaching,
if indeed it is not already here, when what
Canada will need most is another Walter
Harris at the financial helm.
Honourable senators, this problem of inflation and inflationary effect on the high cost
of living is a most baffling and difficult one.
It is something which does not refer or apply
to Canada alone, as honourable senators know.
It exists in the United States and in the
European countries in varying degrees-with
this, I think, difference, an outstanding difference: the countries of Western Europe, I
think largely under the leadership of West
Germany, have got such vivid memories of
the terrible calamities that came to the whole
of the middle-class people of Germany and
France as a result of inflation that they have
resolved never to let it occur again, and are
moving far more intelligently in dealing with
the problem than we are on this side of the
Atlantic.
In many ways the situation as far as Canada and the United States are concerned runs
fairly parallel, and I suspect largely for the
same reasons. It has amazed me that there is
such a lack of public interest in respect to
inflation and its dangers in Canada, and I
think it must flow from the fact that, rightly
or wrongly, the success-for which, I repeat,
the Government of the day got scant creditin keeping the cost of living down over the
last five years has lulled people who should
have known better into indifference as to the
hidden and lurking dangers of inflation.
In any event, that was the characteristic of
our economy. A few organizations-one, in
particular, the Canadian Association of Consumers-have done valuable work, but under
very disheartening circumstances, with very
little public interest and support. We seem,
as a country and as a people, to have only
one idea in mind-that if the cost of living
goes up wages and the returns on capital investment should go up also, regardless of the
source from which they can be secured, that
there will be no day of accounting for our
economy, no matter how high prices go.
That is an amazing situation, but very
lately there has been the beginning of a difference. I think that, for instance, during the
election campaign of 1957 and the period in

SENATE
between that and the recent election, the subject of inflation and its effect on the cost of
living was barely mentioned. The only explanation I can offer is that those responsible
people who were interested and who kept
abreast of these things had become indifferent because of the marked success they
have enjoyed over the past five years.
As honourable senators know, the present
Prime Minister, speaking at the recent meeting of the Canadian Labour Congress, called
the attention of labour to the very serious
consequences that business would suffer if
the inflationary trend continued. The Minister
of Finance recently made a similar statement,
and the Speech from the Throne made passing
reference to this problem. And well they
might, honourable senators.
The report of the Bureau of Statistics for
May 5, states that for the 12-month period
ending March, 1958 the consumer price index
rose 3.4 points, or 10 times as much as the
yearly average for the preceding five years.
Moreover, the rise continued for the last
month, when it increased by almost a point
for the one month alone.
It is only fair to say that these dramatic
rises may not continue at an unabated pace.
There are many factors which enter into the
economic picture and may affect it. Let me
state the problem very briefly, and the reasons
for my thinking in respect to it.
I first reiterate that a continued increase in
the cost of living and the cost of production
in this country will have a most serious effect
on every phase of our economy; that, as
matters stand at the present moment the
chances are very much greater that these
costs will continue to rise rather than decrease.
While this presents a difficult problem to
handle, the only sane and practical solution
I can suggest is that undertaken by the countries of the Common Market of Western
Europe, under the leadership of West Germany, namely, to stop increasing wages and
allowing higher profits. The answer to those
who feel they need either higher net wages
or higher returns is the lowering of the cost
of living.
Honourable senators, let me give a few
instances which, in my humble opinion, point
to the reasons why if prices and costs keep
rising-and I think they will-they will
seriously affect our economy. The first, and
perhaps the most obvious one, is that a rising
cost of living can seriously impair the ability
of our great export industries to export profitably. Honourable senators will remember well
the self-evident truth of the statement, at
least as far as our country is concerned, that
the dynamic influence for growth and development comes basically from our great export
industries. Our great prosperity has resulted

not only from our exports, but from the
tremendous capital investment that has come
into Canada for the development of our
export industries. That, honourable senators,
is the dynamic influence. I think it has tended
to lul us into an indifferent attitude toward
the problern of inflation, and we have come to
believe that because we have reasonably
sound and intelligent people, and half a
continent of natural resources, we have the
world by the neck, so to speak, and that the
peoples of the world must come to us. But
it is now beginning to dawn on us, or it should
be, that that attitude is far from the truth.
Our most serious competition in the future
is going to come from Soviet Russia as a
producer of raw material. It is a country
three times our size, and I think it is fair
to assume that it has three times as much as
we have in natural resources.
In Western Europe, there is another and a
new development, namely, the European
Common Market, which will enjoy a joint
opportunity in the development of the natural
resources of northern Africa. This joint
operation will no doubt be carried on on a
very much lower cost basis than we contemplate. If we continue to stand aside and
watch our cost of living go up, our world
export markets will be in serious danger.
We have had a huge flow of capital into
Canada, but let me say it did not come out
of investors' love of Canada, particularly;
it came as part of a business enterprise for
the purpose of making a fair return on the
money invested. The moment it becomes
known, or is thought to be so, that because
of our high costs we cannot export profitably
our basic production to the markets of the
world, we will find that capital drying up
quickly. Indeed, there will be no problem
of too much American capital flowing into
this country-there won't be any such capital.
The problem then will be, how to get it out
of the country without dislocating our
economy.
My second point is that a rising cost of
living will aggravate the difflculty of our
secondary industries, already high cost producers, to meet outside competition, which is
likely to be intensified. Honourable senators
know that our secondary industries depend
almost entirely on supplying goods to meet
local demands, rather than on export trade.
It must be remembered that the secondary
industries are in a precarious position. According to the Gordon Report, small volume
and less expert production are the main
reasons why the output per man now in
Canada's secondary industries is some 35 to
40 per cent below that of the United States.
Indeed, if it were not for the fact that, as

MAY 28, 1958
the Gordon Report says, labour in this country is paid about 25 per cent less than that
paid for corresponding positions in the United
States, it would be almost impossible to
survive under present circumstances. But if
we drive our costs of living up, and the
cost of production continues to rise, our
secondary industries will become more and
more vulnerable to outside competition, both
from the United States and Western Europe.
Someone may suggest that the answer to
this problem is the putting up of tariffs. I
doubt very much if public opinion in this
country would allow tariffs to be raised high
enough to compensate for the difference in
cost. If that were done, it is a self-evident
fact that it would only aggravate the problem
by causing a further rise in price.
My third point is that a rising cost of living places an intolerable burden on those who
depend on fixed incomes, such as pensioners
and that large group of people whose incomes
are small and not easily changed. I think that
is the most pitiable and tragic effect of our
economy today, that the great mass of people
on fixed and lower incomes are finding the
cost of living going up again and again beyond
their reach and thus creating an intolerable
situation. I notice that some public men have
recently advocated an increase in Government-paid pensions to meet this very situation. But it must be remembered that there
are hundreds of thousands of people in this
country who cannot go to the Government
to get an increase in their payments, simply
because the cost of living is going up. These
people are being placed in an ever-increasingly difficult position.
As the cost of living goes up it raises a
serious question as to the wisdom and effectiveness of all forms of provision for the
future, such as life insurance and pension
plans. When these schemes mature, what will
the money be worth? I read somewhere once
about the inflation in Western Germany which
followed the First World War. At that time
the whole pre-war mortgage indebtedness of
Germany could have been paid off with the
equivalent of one cent American. The whole
of the great debtor class, consisting of those
who owned obligations with which they had
sought to provide for the future, was swept
away. Of course there were others who
gained tremendously by these conditions, but
the upset was terrific. Inflation lessens the
value and attractiveness of all forms of fixed
income investment, such as bonds and mortgages, with the natural result that people who
intend to invest will require higher rates of
interest as compensation for increased risks.
The same trend imposes increased charges on

federal, provincial and municipal Governments in their efforts to provide their respective services, with the result that taxes become higher and higher. Honourable senators
know that very well from their own experience. Nova Scotia is a province which we
have always regarded as soundly financed; but
when, just recently, the federal Government
provided it with an additional $8 million, the
money was swallowed up in the first budget.
The province has now turned to a sales tax
to finance estimated provincial costs of hospital insurance. I am just as sure as that I
stand here that similar rising costs have been
pyramiding all over the country, so that
municipal obligations fall on the neck of the
province, and provincial obligations on the
federal Government's neck. The honourable
senator from Churchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar),
former Chairman of the Finance Committee,
and the honourable senator from MilfordHants (Hon. Mr. Hawkins), the present chairman, as well as the honourable the senior
senator from Winnipeg (Hon. Mr. Haig), who
had a prominent position on the committee,
have warned this country of the dangers of
inflation, but for some curious reason little or
no attention is paid to counsels of this kind.
The honourable Leader of the Opposition
(Hon. Mr. Macdonald), speaking in the course
of this debate, said it would be worth while
for the Senate to go into the question of
inflation. I believe it would. Perhaps we are
too much occupied at the present moment
with the work in hand.
But this question will not be settled in a
day, nor by legislation, but only by the force
of public opinion, plus wise leadership on
the part of governments. Otherwise it will
strike at the whole basis of our economy. I
also suggest that it tremendously increases
and complicates the problems of our institutions of higher learning, particularly those
which cannot readily turn to the Government
to meet their increased costs. Honourable
senators will find an example of the current
attitude in a document which appeared on
my desk this morning, containing representations by a very fine group, the legislative
committee of the railway brotherhoods, who
present to the Government various requirements in which they are interested, notably
with regard to social security, and covering
a wide range of demands. I notice, for instance, requests for higher old age pensions,
larger children's allowances, more of this,
that, and the other thing, based on the rising
cost of living. But I did not see a single
suggestion in this document, from one end
to the other, although I read it two or three
times, as to the desirability of doing something to decrease the rising cost of living,
though surely it is something that should

SENATE
have been taken into consideration. I admit
that the date of the publication was May 1,
so probably it had been printed some weeks
before the startling and dramatic report from
the Bureau of Statisties, which is dated May
5 and covers a relatively recent period. We
know, honourable senators, that this problem
exists, and we cannot be indifferent to it.
I wish to give a few reasons why I think
living costs are more apt to increase than
decrease. In the first place, as I have already
said, there is in this country an amazing
lack of consumer consciousness. The organization I referred to as the Canadian Association of Consumers is the only one that I
know of which is interested in a solution.
Remember that inflation, once it gets started,
does not need anyone to push it along. What
we have to do is to force it down, not push
it up, because in that direction it can look
after itself. The question is whether there is
public interest or an adequately organized
effort to counteract this upward movement.
My second reason for believing that living
costs will increase is based on the continuing
vast expenditures on armaments and the
large program of capital expenditures.
Honourable members will recall that the report of the bureau indicates there has been
no diminution this year of the private capital
program for investment and charges for
armaments. In addition, all Governments are
committed to large capital expenditure programs. Not only will armaments expenditures
not decrease, but they are very likely to increase. I believe our own Prime Minister
has stated that unless some workable limitation of armaments can be found, our own
costs in this direction will be-to use his
own expression-fantastic.
Further, there is in this country no influential group dedicated to forcing a decrease in
rising costs. At least, I know of none. Organized labour is more concerned to use higher
costs of living as an argument for higher
wages than to join any concerted effort to
get costs down. I am not blaming labour at
all, and I am reasonably certain that success
will attend its efforts. For one thing, the
Gordon report states that salary and wage
scales in secondary industry are 25 per cent
lower than on the American side, and it is
generally conceded that Canadian .costs of
living are higher. That is a very strong argument for organized labour to use, and they
can be counted upon to use it to the hilt.
It used to be that agriculture was a champion of lower costs of living. Now organized
agriculture has thrown up the sponge and is
placing its faith in governmental price supports, and it can be counted upon to demand

and secure higher and higher price supports
as living costs increase. And you can't blame
these people.
Those on fixed or low incomes who stand to
suffer most from an increasing cost of living
are not organized and have few effective
champions either within or without Parliament.
Secondary manufacturers are seeking to
solve their difficulties by asking for increased
tariff protection. Some temporary benefits
may result, but the long-term result is to
further aggravate the problem.
There is no political party in Canada
dedicated to efforts to lower the cost of living.
The Conservatives are protectionists, the
C.C.F'ers are protectionists, and sections of
the Liberal party are badly infected.
Lastly in my reasons for thinking the cost
of living is more apt to increase than decrease
is this one. There exists, I believe consciously
or unconsciously, a large group of people in
this country, as in all other countries, who,
far from being opposed to inflation and rising
living costs, are at least very tolerant of the
idea and quite reconciled to its inevitability.
Some, indeed, have already reaped large
profits from inflation and stand to gain them
in the future if it continues-profits which
often are in the form of capital gains, exempt
from income tax.
In every country which has been faced
with this most difficult problem of a continued rise in the cost of living, one of the
most serious facts is that those who could
be most counted upon to exercise a positive
influence toward solving the problem have
been either opposed to anything being done
I have suggested possible
or indifferent.
reasons why a continued rise must be injurious to our economy, and I have also
pointed out why I think there will be a
continued rise. Now I am going to make the
only possible suggestion I can for a solution.
It may well be that at this moment we
in Canada are experiencing the beginning of
an inffation-bred recession. Certainly it is
different from recessions of the past, for the
rising cost of living is keeping pace with
increasing unemployment. How to cure the
situation presents a most baffling problem.
Suggested measures to alleviate unemployment may well aggravate inflation. The
measure which comes first to mind, as far
as unemployment is concerned, is increased
expenditure on public works. Actually, in
the United States, where the condition is not
unlike ours, the Government has been postponing decision on the proposal to undertake
a great program of public works, for the
very reason that while such a program would

MAY 28, 1958
of course tend, to solve the question of unemployment it would at the same time just
heap new fuel on the inflationary fire.
I suggest that our troubles in this respect
in Canada began with the circumstances surrounding the North Atlantic Treaty. Fear
of Soviet Russia led us into joint expenses
of huge proportions for armaments, and at
the same time unsettled world conditions
elsewhere induced the United States to embark on huge developments in Canada as
the nearest and most reliable source of raw
materials. Both activities resulted in demands
for consumer and capital goods far beyond
our own ability to supply. Europe was busy
with her own needs. Fortunately for us, the
United States could supply us and did; otherwise our inflationary troubles would have
been much worse.
In my judgment, the wisest and most
far-seeing men of our time are those who
realized the strain that these expenditures
for armaments would make on the economies
of member nations, and who drafted Article
2 of the North Atlantic Treaty. We all signed
it. We all agreed to eliminate conflict in our
economic policies and to encourage economic
collaboration. Ten years have gone by and
in this respect NATO has done nothing. Tired
of waiting, six of the 15 NATO partners
headed by Germany and France have agreed
to remove all obstacles of trade between themselves over a period of 14 years. They have
agreed not to raise new barriers in the
meantime. They are moving to pool their
production of armaments to reduce costs.
Their answer to inflation is to lower costs of
living by competition and mass production.
The success they have already attained is
prompting the seven other NATO partners
in Europe to seek to join them, and they are
negotiating to do so at this moment.
Honourable senators, it remains for the
two other members of NATO, located on this
side of the Atlantic, to stand aloof, and we
are beginning to pay the penalty. Economic
relations between Canada and the United
States today are worse than those between
France and Germany. I repeat: today, despite
all our close association of language and
history, and our experience of fighting side
by side in two world wars, the economic
relations between us are worse than are those
between France and Germany. Think of what
I am comparing. This spectacle of Canada's
relationship with the United States as compared with France's relationship with Gerinany is an outstanding vindication of those
who, looking for co-operation between partner
nations, wrote into Article 2 an agreement
to endeavour to remove all international trade
rivalries betweei them. We on this side of
the Atlantic are drifting into a position af

vying with each other as to which will become
the greatest citadel of economic nationalism.
I don't know which of us will win the dubious
honour, but the United States is in a much
better position than we are to withstand its
effects. We should avoid at all costs economic
isolation from the rest of the Western World.
I believe that the only way we can reduce
the cost of living and solve our other economic
problems is for Canada and the United States
to follow the lead of those NATO partners
who have already joined the European Free
Trade area, and the seven nations who are
contemplating joining. We should join the
European Common Market in the free trade
area. The European members of NATO are
implementing the spirit of Article II, and we
should join them. We and the United States
solemnly agreed to economic collaboration between the members, and we should honour
our undertakings or get out of NATO if we
are not prepared to do what we said we
would. We, like them, should progressively
remove our tarifT barriers over a period of
years, and, what is of even greater importance
-as we know from bitter experience at the

in the meantime. We should get prices down,
not by controls, but by the clear, clean air
of competition flowing through our economy.
We should pool our armament expenditures
before these staggering costs bankrupt us.
After putting our own house in order we
should welcome the greatest possible trade
with the Soviet and other communist countries. In the development of international
trade lies the greatest hope for the future.
Hon. Clarence V. Emerson: Honourable
senators, in rising to contribute these few
remarks to the debate, it is a great pleasure
to extend my compliments to the Honourable,
the Speaker of the Senate, and to the Deputy
Speaker. I am sure that all honourable senators agree that the traditions and dignity of
this chamber are in most capable and gracious
hands.
At this time I will also take the opportunity
to pay my tribute of respect to the honourable gentleman who discharged the heavy
duties and responsibilities of the Leader of
the Government in the Senate during the
session which ended on February 1 (Hon,
Mr. Haig). I am glad that his wise counsel
and wealth of experience are still at our general disposal although the burden has beer
eased for him in this session. The former
leader will always be known as a greal

SENATE
May I congratulate the two honourable senators who so ably moved and seconded the
Address in reply to the Speech from the
Throne.
I extend most hearty congratulations to the
honourable senator from Rosetown (Hon. Mr.
Aseltine), who has so capably undertaken the
position of Leader of the Government in the
present session. His qualifications have been
accumulated through many years of public
service and it is altogether fitting and proper
that his great experience and knowledge of
public affairs should now be recognized in
such an appropriate manner.
I extend my felicitations to the deputy
leader as well (Hon. Mr. Brunt), and I share
the general regard for his great ability.
I extend most friendly greetings to the
Leader of the Opposition in the Senate (Hon.
Mr. Macdonald), knowing that his responsibilities are always undertaken with a conscientious regard for the dignity of Parliament
and for the good of Canada.
I congratulate the honourable senators who
have entered this chamber for the first time.
I have no doubt that their contribution will
be a most useful and valuable one in the
months and years to come.
Honourable senators, the present session has
begun under political conditions which have
no precedent in our history. In the general
election of March 31 last the Prime Minister
and his colleagues were returned by the
largest majority ever accorded any leader of
a national government. No leader has ever
received as great a mandate in our political
history. I am sure that this tremendous vote
of confidence, by the people of Canada, is a
tribute to the record of the Government during the short life of the Twenty-Third Parliament. The people had voted for a change, and
the Prime Minister and his colleagues
indicated clearly by action and through legislation that they understood and obeyed the
voice of the electors. Of course, it was a
great personal victory for the Prime Minister.
In less than a year and a half he had overcome difficulty after difficulty, obstacle after
obstacle. He had melted away coldness and
misunderstandings which had existed for
generations, all the time gathering new
strength and support from all classes and
creeds and from every section of Canada.
The election represented a great personal
triumph, yet I am sure that every Canadian
admired the Prime Minister for his humility
and sense of dedication which were expressed
in the few words that he addressed to his
fellow Canadians on the night of the election. It reminded us that we live in a country
where religion, moral purpose and human
decency remain all important in our political
life.

Let me say that we in New Brunswick
understand that the policy of the Prime Minister and of the Government is to develop
all parts of Canada; and we understand that
in due course, East and West, North and
South will receive the benefits of this new
policy and of what the Prime Minister has so
aptly described as this new "vision" of
Canada's destiny.
The honourable senator from Northumberland-Miramichi (Hon. Mr. Burchill) was most
gracious in his reference to my maiden speech
last autumn, but implied that he did not
recognize New Brunswick from my description. Perhaps this was due to the fact that
some well-known political landmarks disappeared in June and some more were among
the missing on March 31. However, I know
that the honourable senator, in spite of his
jocular remarks, shares with me an abiding
love for our province and a common determination to do everything that we possibly
can to further the prosperity and well being
of New Brunswick and of its people. I am
sure that my honourable friend joins with
me in welcoming further changes which will
benefit our province. I refer to the plans for
a large oil refinery in East Saint John and
a new paper mill in Lancaster. These will
involve total capital expenditure in the tens
of millions of dollars, create several thousand
new jobs, and greatly increase the industrial
area of the Saint John-Simonds and Lancaster
-already the largest industrial district in the
Atlantic provinces. These projects are being
undertaken by the K. C. Irving interests,
which already have done so much to develop
New Brunswick resources. This new evidence
of faith in the future of the province bas
been very encouraging to every citizen of
New Brunswick.
The establishment of this large refinery in
East Saint John will also involve a great
increase in ocean tonnage, as oil tankers will
be continually using the port. At the present
time, the large capital investment in docks,
warehouses and port facilities of many kinds
is only used for a few months during the year.
It has always seemed to me that a sound
economic policy for Canada as a whole should
be worked out in such a way as to make
much fuller, if not complete use of the ports
of Saint John and Halifax. I trust that the
Department of Transport will take this
broader and longer-term view of the transportation problem in the surveys and investigations now being carried on. The completion of the St. Lawrence Waterway
requires a complete survey of conditionsnot as they existed twenty years ago, but as

MAY 28, 1958
they exist today. I would remind honourable
senators that Saint John and Halifax, as well
as smaller Maritime seaboard cities and
towns, have an important stake in the future
of their ports.
Saint John could be one of the world's
great ports, and the new oil refinery will
certainly lead to expansion in many ways.
The Government has already made a magnificent beginning in helping the Atlantic
provinces to help themselves. It seems to me
that the overall transportation picture is the
aext problem that should be undertaken.
In connection with transportation problems,
the question of the Chignecto canal immediately becomes of great importance. It could
be the key to greater development of coastal
trade. The construction of the St. Lawrence
Seaway has directed attention to the problem of coastal shipping. Although we have
neglected water transportation for many
years, we can no longer afford to overlook
it and must give it the proper place in the
overall picture. Since the Chignecto canal
delegation visited Ottawa in 1950, under the
previous Government, there have been many
changes, including the building of the
Seaway.
For many years some protection of our
position has been afforded by the fact that
foreign shippers had to use a combination
of water and rail in shipping to ports on
the Great Lakes. The Seaway gives them
the advantage of reaching the heart of the
continent by an all-water route. Foreigners
can enjoy very low westbound cargo rates
and ship all the way by water. This situation is likely to destroy the advantages or
preference we had in transportation by rail.
Our position could be worse than it ever
was. The hope of the Maritime ports is to
have water transportation restored to its
former utility, and in order to do that the
construction of the Chignecto canal, in my
thinking, is essential. Important savings in
sea miles would be possible, and many
economic benefits would result from an early
start on construction. Although much information has been compiled in regard to the
canal, from time to time, construction data
and estimates need to be revised in the light
of present day construction costs and present
day construction methods. Furthermore, estimates of the potential traffic and tonnage for
the canal could probably be revised upward
as well in view of economic developments in
the Maritime Provinces during the past few
years.
For all these reasons, honourable senators,
I strongly advocate new interest and support
for this great project.
On previous occasions, I have recommended
that the federal authorities add fire-flghting
57075-4-7

equipment to the facilities of the port of
Saint John. Some twenty-five years ago the
port suffered a crippling blow from fire, and
it could do so again, because the proper
equipment is not yet available to put up a
really effective battle against a large fire on
the Saint John waterfront.
I would call honourable senators' attention
to the opening of Atlantic House in London,
during the latter days of May. This is an
example of co-operation among the Governments of the Atlantic provinces, because the
full costs of this trade office and of maintaining an Agent-General for the Atlantic provinces in the United Kingdom is being met
entirely by the four provincial Governments.
No federal assistance has ever been suggested
or applied for for this purpose. The Premiers
of Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Prince
Edward Island and Newfoundland are now in
London for the opening. The co-operation
which these gentlemen have achieved, although they differ politically, is an example
to the rest of Canada. They form an exceptional group of political leaders who have
been able to place regional welfare high on
their list of priorities and to serve the cause
of Atlantic improvement with real devotion.
Moreover they have maintained this cooperation and worked for the mutual interests
of their people without forgetting the welfare
of Canada as a whole and the welfare of
other regions of Canada. This is a new kind
of Canadianism, where loyalty to one region
of Canada does not prevent loyalty to our
country and to its larger interests. That is the
kind of self-respecting Canadianism which
you will find everywhere in Atlantic Canada
today.
Before closing, I would like to say a few
words in favour of greater consideration for
the municipal level of government. Federal
and provincial governments undoubtedly have
severe problems to face, but their resources
and the legal and constitutional means which
they can use are far greater than municipalities can ever have. I believe that recent
readjustments in income transfers from the
federal to the provincial levels will permit
the provinces to do more for the municipalities. In New Brunswick, Premier Flemming
recently called together the first ProvincialMunicipal Conference in the history of the
province, where free and frank discussion
took place. The results of this conference
exceeded expectations, and I am sure that
the Premier's action will mark a new step
in this direction.
It has been my personal privilege and responsibility to have had a great deal to do

SENATE
tinue to be a source of strength to our way
of life if this can be carried out.
I also desire to extend my best wishes to
honourable senators from British Columbia,
upon the occasion of the one hundredth
anniversary of the founding of that great
province. Its great and wide variety of
natural resources make it one of the greatest
treasure houses on the continent. As honourable senators know, many thousands of New
Brunswickers have settled in British Columbia over the years, and many have
attained positions of great prominence. A
native of Kent county was Premier some
years ago; while the present Premier is also
a native of our province. A number of
honourable senators representing British
Columbia are also natives of New Brunswick. So there has always been a close tie
between our two provinces.

although the province has observed all due

premiums rather than new taxation, is going

Hanourable senators, may I naw continue
my remarks in English by offering my sincere
congratulations ta my calleagues the mover
and the seconder of the motion for an Address
in reply ta the Speech from the Throne. I
have, of course, flot had the apportunity 0f
being present in this chamber during previaus
debates on the Address, but judging front
the generous response ta these speeches I
must canclude that they were in the highest
tradition of this chamber.
Next, may I extend my compliments ta
the Honourabie the Speaker of the Senate as
he continues ta accupy with dignity and
autharity the high office ta which he was
appointed in the last Parliament. Needless
ta say, these compliments apply in full
measure ta you, sir, also, as Acting Speaker.
May I now congratulate one newly appointed in this Parliament namely the
Honourable the Leader of the Government
(Hon. Mr. Aseltine). We few, we band of
brathers, look forward ta his leadership, and
I would be less than perceptive if I did flot
notice the popularity of his appaintment on
bath sides of this hause. May I include in
this tribute my felicitations ta the Deputy
Leader of the Government
(Hon. Mr.
Brunt).
I wauld like also, if I may, ta express my
appreciatian of the moderate and statesmanlike attitude taken by the honourable the

Leader of the Opposition in the Senate (Hait
Mr. Macdonald). I, as a new senatar, must
say that he has created a most favourable
impression.

I have known many honourable sena tors
f or aver 40 years, and I am happy ta become
again closely associated with them. Some 35
years ago the Honourable John Connolly and
I were sitting alongside each other on the
benches of the University of Ottawa, and I
neyer thought then that some day we would
both be sitting together in the Senate, he
representing Ottawa West, and I, Ottawa
East.

Exactiy 23 years ago this month the
Honourable Senator Joseph Bradette, who
was then Member of Parliament for Cochrane,
gave the bride away at my wedding. He was
recalling that fact ta a group of honourable
senators a few days ago, when one honourable gentleman remarked: "lThat is the
trouble with Senator Bradette: he has given
too many brides away! He should have kept
at least one for hîmself!"
Another gentleman with whom I am happy
ta become more closely associated is that
great journalist who has recently published
in one of aur local newspapers short
biographies of ail the Prime Ministers of
Canada and ail the Opposition leaders hie
has known personally during fis distinguished career biographies which, I hope,
wiii be published soon in book form for
the eniightenment of ail Canadians. I refer
ta the Honourable Senator Charles Bishop,
who has been my next-door neighbour for
the past 15 years.
We are ail aware of how much we have
ta learn from aur native Canadians, the
Indians, who are sa well represented here
by aur coileague, Senator Gladstone. The
senatar was appointed ta, the Senate at
approximately the same time as 1 was and
hie occupies a room a few doors away fram
mine. But it was he who convinced me
that, in the course of time, the Indians had
learned at least something fram the white
man. This is the story as he told it ta me.
A gentleman from New York wha had neyer
before left Manhattan Island was always
interested in the lare of the Indians, from
whom, indeed, the island was originaily purchased. Sa hie came ta northern Canada ta
imprave his education in this regard. While
here, he was fortunate enough ta meet an
Indian Chief. He asked the Chief, "Is it
going ta be a coid winter in Canada?" The
Chief replied: "Heap coid." With wide eyes,
the New Yarker asked the Chief, "How do
you know?" The Chief replied: "White man's
wood piles high." It is recorded that the
New Yorker returned ta Manhattan Island
and has flot left since.

SENATE
Lack of communication is the greatest
barrier to understanding, and I am happy to
see that it is gradually being broken down,
particularly in this country. I note that
honourable senators are making a determined
effort to speak both in English and French.
The other ethnic groups are also striving
to be able to communicate their thoughts
in one or other of the official languages of
Canada, while preserving their own cultures,
and indeed, religions, which they brought
with them from abroad.
I do not know how many honourable senators have had the opportunity of visiting
some of the towns and villages of the western
provinces, but I have, and I was amazed to
note the harmony, bonne entente and sense
of national unity that exist in those communities. Some towns whose population does
not exceed four thousand people might have
as many as six churches whose denomination
may be identified by the style and structure
of the buildings. These people, many of whom
have migrated to Canada from countries now
behind the Iron Curtain, understand and
appreciate the true meaning of freedom of
speech, freedom of thought and freedom of
worship, and when we see them living side
by side in such close harmony and adapting
themselves to our way of life we cannot help
but realize that we possess, besides our vast
natural resources, all the necessary human
and spiritual resources with which to build
a strong nation and a great country.
Honourable senators, it is easy to be pessimistic. Indeed, in this imperfect world, a
dedicated pessimist will always find plenty
of ground for gloom. And today, both nationally and internationally, Canada faces challenges as serious and as pressing as any it has
faced in the past. Nevertheless, in my opinion,
Canada is in a position as favourable as that
of any other country in the world to meet
its present and future challenges, whatever
their character. May I list some of the basic
reasons for this belief:
Canada's material resources are virtually
unlimited and, especially to the north, virtually untouched. We are already aware,
from the Speech from the Throne, of the
Government's plan for the development of
that vast part of the country.
Canada's human resources consist of
approximately 17 million people-English,
French and a great variety of other ethnic
groups living together and growing together,
in the manner I have just described, as
Canada expands. Some of us may see 50
million people in Canada, and, if not, our
children will.
Canada's system of Government, based on
the British Parliamentary tradition, is the
equal of any in the world. Among other

things, it conduces to stability of Government
-a necessary and desirable condition which,
as honourable senators know, is rare enough
in other countries. I will take my cue from
the Honourable the Leader of the Opposition
(Hon. Mr. Macdonald), and avoid the temptation of indulging in narrow partisan observations, but I think it is quite clear from the
recent election that the people of Canada
were net satisfied with a minority Government which might be dislodged at any
moment by caprice, accident or design, and
that they made their will known unmistakably from one end of Canada to the other.
There will be a Canadian Government firmly
in office for at least the next four or five
years, and this in itself is a good thing. I
will go no further, though my instincts might
urge me to extend my observations at this
point!
Hon. Senators: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. Choquelie: In addition, we now
have a truly national Government, fully
representative of all provinces, which Government should be in a favourable position to
eliminate or reduce sectional rivalries and to
accommodate, so far as possible, the views
and aspirations of all the provinces.
Further, the people of Canada, as the honourable senator from Winnipeg South (Hon.
Mr. Thorvaldson) has already said, have in
effect restored the two-party system.
I
lhink most honourable senators will welcome
this eventuality. Certainly it is an understatement to assert that a multiplicity of
parties does not contribute to the orderly functioning of the Parliamentary system.
And finally, in my view, Canada has the
finest Civil Service in the world, capable of
accomplishing what may be asked of it by
Government in the days ahead.
Honourable senators, having made these
few remarks, I would like to express my
pride and pleasure in being able to join with
you in transacting the business of Parliament.
It bas been said by eminent senators that,
although appointments to this chamber are
made on the recommendation of the Government of the day, and although the Upper
House is organized along party lines for the
transaction of public business, these lines are
not severely drawn. I have seen many evidences of this in the short time that I have
been here, and this happy fact increases my
pride of membership. Many honourable senators are rich in parliamentary experience,
whether in the House of Commons, in provincial legislatures, or in this chamber. Moreover, all honourable senators have attained
distinction in some field of endeavour quite

MAY 29. 1958
outside politics, and together they contribute
to a vast reservoir of talent and experience
without a counterpart in this country. No
one can be an expert on everything, but the
combined total of this vast experience and
expertise, whether applied to the consideration of legislation or to the discussion of
public affairs, must surely redound to the
benefit of the people of Canada.
Honourable senators, as a practising lawyer
I am still a novice in Parliamentary matters,
but I make this pledge: I will study and
learn, under the tutelage of senators of experience, so that in the fulness of time I may
make a helpful contribution to the deliberations of this assembly.
Hon. Joseph A. Bradette: Honourable senators, will the honourable Acting Speaker
(Hon. Mr. Pearson) oblige by delivering to
the Speaker of the Senate, the Honourable
Mark R. Drouin, the following statement:
May I join with other senators in this forum
in extending to him my sincere congratulations upon his renomination to his high office,
which he fully deserved because of the ability
and fairmindedness which he showed in
presiding over our deliberations-qualities that
were so well demonstrated that a large section of our press has often mentioned his name
for a still more exalted position. It is with
pleasure that I offer him my best wishes.
I also extend my congratulations to the
honourable the senior senator from Winnipeg
(Hon. Mr. Haig). This personage has had a
wonderful life, having an extensive law
practice, and also great experience in the
political field as a member of the Manitoba
Legislature for many years: then, upon
appointment to the Senate, he immediately
made his mark, becoming some years ago
Leader of the Opposition, and, last session,
Leader of the Government. He bas made a
great success of all these activities and he may
now well rest on his oars after races well
run and won. He must also feel the contentment resulting from work well done.
I also extend my felicitations to the present
Leader of the Government in this chamber,
the honourable senator from Rosetown (Hon.
Mr. Aseltine). He has had wide experience
in this house and his activities are well
known. He acquitted himself with ability
when he acted as Leader of the Opposition
in the absence of the senior senator from
Winnipeg (Hon. Mr. Haig). I want to felicitate
him also upon the remarks he made in French.
This sort of thing goes very deeply with
French-speaking Canadians who, as you know,
are a strong and well-organized minority
group, but any gesture of comprehension
and friendship coming from the majority
group is highly appreciated. Again I want to
compliment him for what he did when he

spoke the other day. The honourable Leader
of the Government in the Senate also has
wide experience in the bouse, his activities
being well-known. I don't know whether
I am in order or not, but I fervently hope he
will be appointed to the cabinet, and I
sincerely make a plea for this appointment.
I feel it is the proper liaison to have between
the two chambers, for then we would be
sitting with a member of the cabinet, a
member of the Government, who would be in
a position in the Senate to give us some
information that perhaps otherwise we would
have to get in some second-hand way. The
appointment would not establish a precedent,
for many Leaders of the Government in the
Senate have been members of the cabinet,
with or without portfolio. I believe that in
what I am now saying I am expressing the
wish of most honourable senators listening
to me.
(Translation):
I also wish to congratulate the new senators
upon their appointments, and specially the
honourable senator from Ottawa East (Hon.
Mr. Choquette) whom I have had the pleasure
of knowing for a number of years. His
experience in active politics, as well as the
success he has attained in the legal profession,
will stand him in good stead in his new
duties. He also mentioned an event which I
always recall with pleasure; it is my having
given away the bride at his wedding. I
might add that I found her at that time just
as attractive and charming as I do today.
(Text):
I was very proud when the honourable senator from Ottawa East stated a few moments
ago that I had given away the bride at his
wedding. It was a great honour and pleasure
for me. I have always found her very attractive and charming indeed.
(Translation):
My congratulations also go to the mover of
the Address in reply to the Speech from the
Throne, the honourable gentleman from MilleIsles (Hon. Mr. Monette). His eloquence and
the assurance with which he expresses his
thoughts reflect his great success in the legal
profession, and I am sure his talents will
be highly appreciated in this chamber.
(Text):
I would also like to extend my felicitations
to the honourable the junior senator from
Winnipeg (Hon. Mr. Thorvaldson), on the
manner in which he seconded the Address in
reply to the Speech from the Throne. I
listened with interest to his fine remarks on
the subjects he dealt with and I hope he will
often be heard in this house.

SENATE
His remarks about Canadian-American relations were very moderate. I could call them
practical but, unfortunately, what he advocated has not been practised by all. Had it
not been for American capital investment,
there would not have been the great development that has taken place in the last 50 years
in northern Ontario, my section of Canada.
During the last election campaign our district
had the honour and privilege of being paid
a visit by the Prime Minister, who received
a big reception in Kapuskasing. In 1924
Kapuskasing was a small and lightly populated but thriving rural section. Today it is
a fine town in which the New York Times
has invested over $35 million-American
capital, my honourable friends. This investment has benefited not only the investors but
also the people of Canada generally, particularly those living in the northern section of
Ontario. This story of American investment
is just as true with respect to the mining
sections, the newsprint producing sections and
Ungava and British Columbia, and in fact all
Canada. I never like the idea of restricting
trade with the United States. I remember
during the second election campaign in which
I voted, in 1911, I heard for weeks on end the
cry "No truck nor trade with the Yankees".
I do not want that sort of thing to be repeated
in Canada's national life, for it is not at all
necessary.
Honourable senators, I am going to quote
from a newspaper article. This is something
that I seldom do and I never did it in the
House of Commons. The article is very well
worded. I might say it does not come from
a Liberal paper, but from a good Conservative
paper, the Ottawa Journal.Apparently on the
night of Saturday, January 4, 1958, a newsreel
film was shown in a Toronto theatre. In an
editorial entitled "How Foolish Can People
Get About Americans?" the Journalwrote, on
January 7:
When on Saturday night a newsreel film in a
Toronto theatre pictured the failure of the United
States Vanguard rocket at Cape Canaveral in
Florida, people in the audience clapped and cheered
and shouted "Hurray".

I shall read most of the editorial, for I
believe it provides a great lesson and will be
of interest to everyone of us. Providence has

willed that Canada and the United States
should be neighbours, and they have been
good neighbours. The article continues:
What sort of mental madness is this? Failure of
a United States rocket was not merely an American
defeat: it was as well our defeat, the defeat of
our side, the defeat of the West. Yet here we
have some Canadians applauding it, taking joy
from it, greeting it with cheers.
Why?
To argue from the particular to the general
is always wrong, and it might be wrong indeed to
conclude that this imbecility in a Toronto theatre
represented much or anything of Canadian thought.

We would like to believe this; like to be able to
say comfortably that such a moronic manifestation
was nothing more than justification of the dictum
that "mistakes of great men are the consolation
of dunces".
But we confess our Inability to believe or say
that-to say it without qualification.
And the reason-we may as well speak it frankly
-is that we find of late in a section of our press,
in the House of Commons and in the statements
of some of our so-called commentators, a note of
hostility towards the United States, a seeming
touch of the ugly thing of anti-Americanism.

We have seen that sort of attitude in the
House of Commons for the last three
or four years, and it has not been
conducive to good friendship between our
two nations. I continue reading from the
article:
The United States of late has done some things
about our trade that should cause us concern,
and in such circumstances it must be our part
to protest through the right channels; to present
our case as one neighbour to another in a frank,
manly, good-mannered way.
But that-manly, vigorous protest through the
right channels-is a far different thing from loud
repetition of our grievances from the housetops,
comforting common enemies and perhaps affording
them opportunity to exploit what may seem to
them serious divisions.
Certainly it is a far different thing from suggestions heard in some quarters about retaliationabout the possibility of our imposing 15 per cent
export taxes on newsprint we ship to the U.S.,
or an "the nickel or the uranium, or the iron
ore".

In my own constituency in northern On-

tario we have three newsprint and sulphate
mills. We have a great gold mining industry
and a great lumber industry, and 95 per cent
of our products goes directly to the United
States. Every day we see the spectacle of
loaded freight trains consistng of 45 to 65

box cars leaving Kapuskasing for the United
States. We certainly cannot take any chances
on losing that kind of trade with Our
neighbour to the south.
Honourable senators, I am not going to
read the whole editorial from which I have
been quoting but I wish to read the last three
paragraphs:
The diversion of some of Canada's trade from
the United States to other markets, notably to
the United Kingdom and Commonwealth markets,
would be a good thing. But it would be a good
thing not because we have reason to dislike
Americans or imagine that they dislike us, but
simply as a matter of economic wisdom-the
wisdom of not wanting to have all our trading
eggs in one basket.
Americans are not perfect; far from it. But if
in bearing their awesome world responsibility
they sometimes seem to take courses we find
strange, or if in their trading relations with us
they sometimes seem to act as if they were too
little conscious of our existence, let us not wrap
garments of virtue around ourselves and say how
much wiser and nobler we would be were we in
their position.
Far better, we suggest that occasionally we ask
ourselves two questions: First, what nation in ail

MAY 29, 1958
of the world's history has ever had a better
netghbor, and, secondly, what nation in all creation has a better neighbor now?
Honourable senators, it is my intention now
to deal with the international situation, and
more particularly our attitude vis-à-vis Soviet
Russia. I have made several trips to Europe,
the Middle East and Asia, and on each of
such trips I have studied the national and
international situation with respect to those
countries. Hitler stated clearly in his book
Mein Kampf the way he would conquer the
world. Yet, nobody believed what he wrote:
I did not believe it myself. Sir Winston
Churchill was the only great statesman of
the West who believed what Hitler wrote,
and he warned the democratie countries of
the dangers forecast in that book. The United
States was lukewarm about entering the fray,
but Roosevelt was sympathetic to the Allied
cause. Until the Americans got caught at
Pearl Harbour it was hard for them to
believe that such a thing could happen. These
facts demonstrate well the need for being
prepared for any eventuality.
. The question that is most in our minds at
the moment, and which now has been under
discussion and study for almost a year, is the
proposal for a meeting at the submit which
was initiated by Moscow, and on which a
great amount of correspondence bas been
exchanged between the East and the West.
On this matter quite a large number of
nations are under the impression that Soviet
Russia bas maintained the initiative, which
has given her quite a lot of favourable publicity. Apparently on a question of such great
importance we do not seem to be able to take
the initiative, and we appear to be divided
among ourselves on the mode of acceptance
and the agenda that such a conference will
be ready to proceed on, and it seems that
there is no unanimity among the democracies
on the time and place where it should be
held, and which nations should be participants.
Another important stage in East-West negotiations-and in Anglo-American relations as
well-has begun. It is a time when the two
big power blocs are inching along, perhaps
more effectively than ever before, toward a
summit parley. It is also a moment when
Britain and the United States, separately and
jointly, need to re-examine their concepts of
summity once more, and also their outlook
toward suspension of H-bomb tests. It is
certainly desirable for both nations to see
eye to eye on both subjects.
On the question of summity, it is apparent
that the average Briton regards himself as
more willing than the Americans to have
top-level talks to begin without laying down
too many stipulations. It naturally follows
that a cross-section of the people of Great
57075-4-8

Britain also was less critical of the Soviet
package for pre-summit negotiations to start
last April 17 than the first Washington reaction indicated the United States would be,
and there can be no doubt that there is a
greater disposition of the British to talk.
Such a venturesome spirit in dealing with
other nations goes back for many centuries
with Britons. Undoubtedly they suspect that
Americans, while adventurous too, have confined their talents primarily to national
aff airs.
I believe that it would be entirely satisfactory for Britons for example, to have their
Prime Minister meet Premier Nikita S.
Khrushchev to discuss East-West problems
and attempt to make some progress. But
if it was found impossible to achieve anything, the British leader could come home
empty-handed and say: "I did the very best
I could, but they would not agree to anything
reasonable"; and I am convinced they would
believe him and, moreover, classify the
démarche as worthwhile, because it is a fact
that Britons have confidence in their
diplomats to hold their own conversationally
with anyone, not to fall into negotiating traps
and perhaps even to get the best of the other
side.
If, as one certainly can hope, exportable
communism becomes a diminishing and,
finally, an atavistic force in Soviet policy
making, the time will come when Soviet
policy makers will come to regard capitalism
as an objective term, not a subjective battle
cry. At such a time summit talks could be
conducted in an easier and perhaps more
fruitful context; but, unfortunately for the
peace of the world, that time bas not arrived
yet. Right now there is no possibility of
useful negotiations over Germany or the Far
East or the Middle East and Africa. We of the
West want the Soviet Union to cease being
an expanding empire, and the communists
want us to stop resisting their expansion.
Between such positions there is no agreed
reconciliation. A summit meeting now would
be largely a place where Soviets attempted
to rationalize and justify their expansionism
for propaganda purposes. At best it might
produce tacit rules limiting the instruments
they would use for expansion and those we
would use in resisting that expansion, and
tacit rules to keep open channels of diplomatic
communication. More substantial agreements,
many observers are convinced, must await
the meeting which might take place when
the context of world relation is very different from what it is today. May that time
be reached sooner than we can foresee at
the present time.
On the matter of suspending H-bomb tests,
Great Britain also finds a tendency to run

SENATE
in advance of the Americans. After the next
series of British and American nuclear tests
are finished this summer, many individuals
here will be eager to see a halt by the
Western powers, whether or not this is
deemed a reply to the Soviet test-ban proposal.
The British Government is determined to
keep in step with Washington, no matter what
the outcome will be. The ability of Britain
to justify suspension of tests at this stage
will depend on whether the United States
revises the McMahon Act. One piece of
American legislation of extreme concern to
the British Government at the moment is
the Eisenhower administration bill to amend
the McMahon Act. This 1946 act makes it
unlawful for the United States to share atomic
secrets even with its best allies. Today the
British are anxious that the proposed revisions, calling for exchanges of certain information under certain conditions, be
accepted.
Much of the nuclear information Britain
seeks is almost certainly known to American
experts now and could be provided if the
secrecy provisions of the act were eased.
However, officials in the United States realize
how serious could be reservations about calling a halt to tests even after the summer
series, and some probably understand why.
It is also expected that France will not agree
to suspension until she bas had a chance to
test her own bomb. So Britain really is sending out two signals on both talks and tests.
The official one is loud, clear and firmly in
line with alliance policies; the unofficial one,
if less clear, likewise is loud in protest that
official policies are too negative. The desire
of the common man on the Western side, declares the Times of London, forthrightly, "is
to cut the cackle and get on with the job".
The matter of a summit conference is very
important to Canada, and at present the Government has taken it very, very seriously.
Our Prime Minister has invited the powers
to hold the conference in this country, and
lie should be praised for this action. As of
the Christian and Judaic faiths, we believe
in a Divine Providence and being gifted with
free will, which debars the complex of fatalism. We believe that the Almighty leaves us
free in our actions, but if humanity decided
to use those terrifying machines of destruction invented by human science and invention, in a worldwide conflagration, which
would undoubtedly destroy our civilization,
as we know it now, for centuries to come,
who would dare to believe that God would
interfere to stop such a cataclysm that had
been willed by the human mind? The survival
of man's destiny on this planet cannot rest
on hope of such intervention.

We desire with all our hearts that such a
conference will succeed, because in this country we desire and pray for peace and we will
continue to do so until it is obtained. But if
new promises and solemnly signed agreements result from negotiations with the Soviet
Union, "to reduce East-West tensions", how
much trust can the free world put in the
good faith of the Reds? This is an allimportant question on the international scene
today. The only way to answer it would be
to examine the Kremlin's record of performance on past agreements, and this has to be
repeated time and time again so that we will
not forget it. However, time will not permit
me to do this, but the facts are well known
to every member of this house and so I will
make just a few remarks on this subject.
In our dealings with Soviet Russia in the
fifteen years since President Roosevelt and
Sir Winston Churchill met Premier Stalin in
Tehran, three Presidents of the United States
and six United States Secretaries of State
have engaged in 19 high level talks with their
opposite numbers in the Soviet Government.
Out of these talks came some 40 agreements
involving specific Soviet promises. Of these,
37 were cynically violated. In the spring of
1955 a fully documented study of nearly 1,000
Soviet treaties was made public by the United
States Senate Subcommittee on Internal Security. The U.S.S.R., the study showed, "had
broken its word to virtually every country to
which it ever gave a signed promise."
Let us consider for a moment the summit
meeting in July 1955 when President
Eisenhower and the Prime Ministers of
Britain and France went to Geneva. Rarely
had a conference with the Soviets been
approached with greater optimism. Said the
Right Honourable R. A. Butler, then Britain's
Chancellor of the Exchequer:
There is in the international scene today a
feeling of spring after a long winter of discontent.

The proceedings were loud with the rhetoric of good will.
The end product of this charade of amiability was three generalized "directives" to
the Foreign Ministers, instructed to meet in
the same city three months later:
(1) The settlement of the German problem and
the reunification of Germany by means of free
elections;
(2) A "system for the control and reduction of
all armaments and armed forces under effective
safeguards", to be worked out by the United
Nations Disarmament Commission; and
(3) Gradual lifting of the iron curtain through
more "free contacts and exchanges".

But the "feeling of spring" evaporated at
the Foreign Ministers' gathering in the fall
as soon as Molotov parted his thin lips to
emit wintry blasts. He bitterly denounced
suggestions for freer exchanges of persons as

MAY 29, 1958
a plot to smuggle spies into his country. lie
spurned the United Nations Disarmament
machinery and refused to discuss the German
problem. In short, within four months after
a solemn "summit meeting" the Soviets reneged on all three of their commitments.
The past should not be a deterrent to trying
again in the hope that Soviet Russia will
come to her senses and be true to her word.
In all these talks about negotiations at the
summit, there is always in the mind of thinking people the thought that the dangers of a
world war are constantly with us, although
the prevailing inclination is not to think
about it at all-in the hope, perhaps, that by
putting it out of mind it will somehow be
put out of the realm of possibility, but a
potent and serious matter of this importance
does not disappear simply by ignoring it or
by wishful thinking.
Will there be a third world war within
the next five, ten or thirty years? Naturally,
like every sane person, I desperately hope
and pray that the catastrophe will not happen
-so much so that the deep wish that it may
not happen makes me really believe that it
will not. But the more one thinks this, the
more important it becomes boldly to face the
facts, for it is only in the knowledge of these
facts that we can take the right steps to avert
the dangers of the future and to save the
world from what is unthinkable but unfortunately not by any means impossible.
What are the facts?
The Soviet, despite internal changes in the
régimes and an internal easing up of the
police state, has given no sign whatever over
the years of taking one clear step forward to
find a peaceful modus vivendi-mode of living-with the free world. One can dismiss
as insignificant, except for propaganda purposes, the slight raising of the curtain for
cultural, sporting, trade relations. We love
the Russian people, we love their songs, we
love their laws, we love their country, but
we do not like their Government, we do not
like what communism is trying to do. We
were glad indeed to have a visit from the
young Russian hockey players who toured
this country last winter. We saw them as our
sons, we saw them as our friends, because we
can have no quarrel with the Russian people
themselves, no quarrel with their country.
It is the communism of that country that we
all abhor. What the Russians are doing along
this line simply means that Moscow has
become wise to the stupidity of an absolutely
immovable curtain.
On the contrary, Russia's policy has continuously sought the means to keep its relations with the West prickly and potentially
dangerous. You only have to study the history
57075-4--8

of the last ten years to know how true this
is. Without going back over the past it is
sufficient today to point to perhaps the most
dangerous adventure of them all, the present
Soviet-made trouble in the Middle East. Why
should the Soviet have steadily increased its
anti-Semitism, an outlook clearly contrary to
its propaganda pretention of liberalism and
one that links the Soviet with hated Hitlerism? There can be only one reason: the desire
to court the Arab world, whose one real
interest is to destroy the young nation Israel.
Not that the Soviet has the slightest love for
the ultra-nationalistic and feudal Arab. But
it knows that the oil wealth of the Middle
East is strategically and commercially vital
to the West; that the West has had to link
itself commercially with the Arabs, while at
the same time seeking to maintain good relations with Israel and defend it; that any
military action in the Midle East in defence
of Western interests is fraught with the
gravest political and military danger for the
peace of the world.
How simplified that situation would become, if tomorrow Soviet Russia would decide
to honestly co-operate with the West for the
solution of Mid-Eastern problems like the
refugee question and the official recognition
of the State of Israel. Such a change of
policy and attitude on the part of the Soviet
would be a great step toward solution of the
serious problems which have to be faced and
solved; and what a great factor it would be
in appeasement and the relief of tensions
which carry in their existence grave dangers
to the maintenance of peace in the world!
Unerringly, therefore, Moscow has seized
on the sorest spot in the Western position
and deliberately set out to pick at that sore
and steadily aggravate it, trying in no way
to help heal it.
From her own point of view, as regards
security, one may find a single excuse to
account for this policy, namely, the Soviet's
long-term fear of communist China. Moscow
may reasonably feel that she must strengthen
her resources and gain prestige in order to
hold her own against an emerging China
with a much vaster population and immense
resources on the point of being intensively
exploited. Yet, Russia is so far ahead of
China in technique and armaments that it
is hard to see why she should risk major
trouble with the West simply to defend herself against a danger which still remains far
in the future. If, indeed, she is worried
about China, this could be only a very
secondary consideration in her Middle-East
policy. It is a well known fact that China
has some territorial accounts to settle with
Russia and she will never rest satisfied until
such time as these problems have been

SENATE

solved to her satisfaction; problems like the
question of Outer Mongolia, Vladivostock,
Port Arthur, and even the question of
Siberia, all of which territories are considered by Asiatics to be integral parts of
China and Asia.
The real motive would simply seem to be
that Moscow knows that the more trouble
she can make in the Middle East, the more
awkward it will be for the West. Our views
about Israel clash with our need to maintain friendly relations with the Arabs, who
themselves have been divided by Moscow's
intrigue into hostile sections, thus giving
the communists the excuse they need for
subversive interference to keep the peace.
Meanwhile, Turkey, on the Soviet border,
may be involved. And, to the West, Arab
nationalism, encouraged by Moscow, can set
North Africa ablaze the more easily in that
the European attitude to countries like
Algeria, created and civilized by Europe,
clashes with American views which frown
on all colonialism, however progressive.
In my statement I do not pretend to offer
an expert survey on the factors involved
in the Middle East today. The question I
ask is, why is Russia, at this moment of
decisive nuclear development, still going out
of its way to make trouble in this area? Is
Russia simply being awkward just to annoy,
or has Russia chosen the Middle East as the
place where, by standing firm and uncooperative at any cost, she can force the West
to a humiliating and commercially disastrous
surrender as the only alternative to risking
the outbreak of the third world war?
To put it otherwise, is the Middle East, in
regard to a third world war, what Austria,
Czechoslovakia and Poland were for Hitler
in regard to the Second World War? For,
at this moment, this is what it looks like.
The Soviet made her eastern European
conquests during the aftermath of war,
knowing well that no one could or would
stop her. The aggression, defeated by the
Berlin airlift, and the Korean war, were
calculated risks at a time when Russia was
far behind the West in technical advances
of every kind. Today, Russia feels herself
the equal, or even the superior, of the West
in armament and technique, and meanwhile
she retains her immense advantage in military manpower as well as in submarines.
These, apart from the use of H-bombs, would
ensure immediate victory for the Soviet over
Europe, Asia and Africa. And now she has
played her cards so skilfully in the Middle
East that she could any day take action
which would give the West a simple choice
between surrender or nuclear defence-in
other words, the third world war.
However, in such a situation no doubt
that there will be grave dangers for Russia,

and history may repeat itself. It must be
remembered that during the last war, in the
first three and a half months of Hitler's invasion of Russia he took as prisoners well
over two million Russian soldiers fully equipped and with all their officers. Had Hitler
not been such a tyrant and dictator himself,
and had he not, by his terrible massacres of
the civilian population of the Russian provinces which his armies had occupied, turned
these people against him and swung their
loyalty to Stalin, whom they deeply hated,
Hitler could have defeated Stalin and communism with the Russian soldiers themselves,
with very small losses to his own armies.
It was unfortunate for the world that Hitler
was a dictator. The presence of the British,
Free French or Americans at the time would
have changed world history.
At the end of the fighting in Korea almost
half of 116,000 North Korean and Chinese
military prisoners refused to return home.
Among United Nations prisoners who preferred
to live under communism the score was as
follows: 325 South Koreans, 22 Americans,
one Briton.
Blood will always be thicker than water. A
German will always be a German, with the
exception of a few renegades, and this applies
to all the satellite countries at present under
the Soviet yoke. Unless Russia can win a
lightning war, her military situation will very
quickly become exceedingly brittle and deteriorate rapidly, as none of those nations
will have their heart in a fight to defend
Soviet Russia. The political convulsions that
have already happened in East Germany,
Hungary and Yugoslavia will be terribly
magnified under war conditions, with great
defections among the armed forces even in
Russia itself, as happened in World War II.
This does not mean that that situation
should deter us from dealing from strength
with Russia at all times, because this would
be fatal to our cause, and there is no way
for us of trying to read the minds of the
dangerous men who govern Russia. Many
people feel that the growing hatred of communism in Soviet-dominated Eastern Europe
must prevent Moscow from going too far;
and, I mentioned a few moments ago, at the
first sign of war millions would rise up in
Eastern Europe, and perhaps within Russia
itself, to revenge themselves on the oppressor. But unfortunately this view overlooks one important factor. The restiveness
in Eastern Europe has been brought about
by a feeling, right or wrong, that the ending
of the Stalin era bas made the Soviet less
ruthless and more civilized. But if, in fact,
the Soviet has not really changed at all or,
if one prefers it, if the old communist aggression has simply changed to Russian

MAY 29, 1958
military imperialism, then Russia's problem
in Eastern Europe would most easily be
solved by a military occupation that might
reach right up to the Atlantic. It is said
that when Hungary revolted there were
military leaders in Russia who wanted to do
just that.
If then, we were ready courageously to
face the facts-and for us who believe in our
political systems this is the only sane prescription-we shall have to admit that we are
today in an extremely perilous position.
Any day Russia can force the West to a
vital decision by coming out openly on the
side of Egypt and Syria; by inciting the
Arabs generally to aggression against Israel
and promising her help by demanding guarantees against supposed anti-Russian hostility in her neighbour, Turkey. In such
circumstances, the West could only choose
between ineffective retaliatory diplomacy,
which would be interpreted by the Arabs
as pro-Israel, and counter-measures which
would be near-military or actually military.
A local war, like that in Korea, would inevitably break out, and it is hard to see how
the West would win in a terrain which Russia
could so easily occupy by so-called volunteers,
while at sea Russia possesses her Black Sea
bases from which, under air cover, she could
orce the Bosphorus and the Dardanelles.
This would inevitably and immediately
lead to the supreme question: would the
West admit defeat rather than begin fullscale nuclear warfare, or would she find
herself forced to take on the tremendous
moral onus of first using the H-bomb, knowing that Britain and our allies in Europe
would at once face grievous destruction and
the industrial centres of the United States
and Canada would be most gravely damaged?
I am convinced we can take it for granted
that if Moscow were absolutely certain that
the H-bomb would be used by the West in
certain clearly described and foreseen conditions, Russia would never risk the catastrophe
which she herself would suffer in at least
equal measure with the West. But it is also
to be feared that, as things are, Russia may
well believe that, when it came to the test,
America, Britain, France and West Germany
would recoil from initiating the universal
cataclysm. And precisely there lies the great
danger of a third world war in the not
distant future.
That is why it seems to me so dangerous
that public opinion in the West prefers to
play the ostrich over the possibility of a
third world war. In doing so it is playing
into the hands of the Soviet authorities.
Rightly or wrongly, they deduce from this
attitude that the degeneracy of the West gives
a green light for intensifying safely their

natural and continuous policy of diplomatic
aggression, at points where the West is most
vulnerable. Not less important is the fact
that the present temper of public opinion in
the West tempts us to believe that we can
still afford the luxury of divided councils
and unnecessary competition.
Surely there is no honest citizen on our
side who seriously thinks that the United
States and the other Western powers either
desire a third world war or would do anything which could reasonably be said to
further or risk the onset of such a moral
disaster. On the contrary, it is patent to any
honest observer that the will to avoid another
war governs Western policy and, in one sense,
even gravely weakens it when dealing with
an opponent who holds that the end will
always justify any evil means. This is not
to say that America and other nations have
not made political mistakes, nor is it to deny
that legitimate self-interest bas played its
part in policy decisions. But the over-all
moral position is clear. Aggression does not
enter into Western plans. There is, in fact, a
rather desperate effort to yield as much as is
consistent with self-defence and with a justified lack of confidence in an opponent whose
record is one of trickery, bad faith and aggressive manoeuvre. Even at the present time
there is in the United States the Truman
school of thought, which favours containment,
and George Keenan's disengagement idea in
dealing with Soviet Russia.
In the light of all these considerations,
though our conscience tells us that we have
left many things undone, spiritually, morally
and internationally, it also reminds us that,
far from willing aggression, we often bend
over backward to avoid giving any suggestion of it.
The choice, therefore, lies between consent
to suicide and a facing up to the truth, with
preparations to take such steps, however
terrible, as seem absolutely necessary to implement our right to survive and to defend
the moral order. May we not reasonably expect that if we thus obey our consciences
and honour our responsibilities, God, in whom
we believe, will either ordain that the final
disaster shall be avoided, or, if His will be
otherwise, give us the courage to face up to
the worst and move us to offer the Almighty
our most fervent prayers for the strength to
face that situation?
It is thinking of this kind, it seems to me,
which the West requires today-thinking
which boldly faces the truth, which acts
courageously in the light of that truth, and
which strengthens the resolution to sustain,
whatever may come. We also need thinking
which will lead to greater unity and understanding among us all. Must -we not admitý

SENATE
when facing the question whether there will
be a third world war, that the best way to
prevent it is to be ready to think out and to
do the things which our judgment, our observation and our conscience tell us should
be done, and, in the light of that decision, to
act together?
It is true that Canada is not among the
great powers, but in the world at large and,
for many years, in the council of nations, it
has taken a respected and leading part and
has been the spearhead of many movements
which have greatly helped to maintain peace.
For a considerable time the Honourable
Lester Pearson held with great honour and
ability the important folio of External Affairs
in the federal cabinet. In that forum he covered himself with honour and distinction. His
fine work in the international field received
a well-deserved recognition last fall in the
award to him of the Nobel prize for peace. I
have no doubt that the present head of the
Department of External Affairs will also work
with great competence for the maintenance
of world peace, and I wish him full success
in his serious and responsible activities.
The name of Canada is highly respected
throughout the world. No nation of our size
participated more quickly and strongly than
did we in the last two Great Wars. Our
participation was not influenced by the desire
for any territorial aggrandisement or maritime
expansion. We supported our allies with
the best that we had, for we knew that we
were fighting against barbarism and tyranny,
and on behalf of the ideals which we cherish
most,-freedom, democracy and the Christian
virtues. The same idealism will, I am sure,
continue to guide us in all our actions in
future.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Reid, debate
adjourned.

Motion agreed to and bill read second time.
REFERRED TO COMMITTEE
On motion of Hon. Mr. Howard, bill
referred to the Standing Committee on

Banking and Commerce.
MERCANTILE AND GENERAL REINSURANCE
COMPANY OF CANADA LIMITEDSECOND READING

Hon. William R. Bruni moved the second
reading of Bill S-3, respecting The Mercantile
Company of
and General Reinsurance
Canada Limited.

He said: Honourable senators, I thought
it might be wise to give a word of explanation
in connection with the bill.
Hon. Mr. Reid: The rules of the house
provide for that, anyway.
Hon. Mr. Bruni: The purpose of this bill
is to bring about the passing of a special act
under which the authorized capital of the
Mercantile and General Reinsurance Company
of Canada will be increased from $1 million
to $5 million. In view of the fact that some
honourable senators will not be attending the
meeting of the Banking and Commerce Committee when it is dealing with this legislation,
I thought I would give a further word of
explanation.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Yes, go ahead.
Hon. Mr. Bruni: This company was originally incorporated by a special act of the
Parliament of Canada, Chapter 71 of the
Statutes of 1951, first session with a capitalization of $1 million. Out of the original
capitalization consisting of 10,000 shares of
par value of $100 each, 7,500 shares have
been duly issued, so that the outstanding
capital of the company at the present time
is $750,000.
The company bas 11 directors and each
director holds 10 shares of capital stock
of par value of $100 each or a total value
of $1,000, this being in accordance with the
provisions set out in the Canadian and British
Insurance Companies Act. In all, the 11
directors of the company hold a total of
110 shares of par value of $100 each, having
a total value of $11,000. All the remaining
issued shares are held by the parent conpany, namely, the Mercantile and General
There
Reinsurance Company of England.
bas been paid into the treasury of the
Canadian company for the issuance of the
aforesaid 7,500 shares a total of $1,500,000,
being at the rate of $200 per share, which
is double the par value of the stock. Of
the aforesaid sum of $1,500,000, $750,000 has
been credited to the capital surplus account
of the company and the remaining $750,000
to the capital account of the company.
At the present time there remain unissued
in the treasury of the company 2,500 shares
of a par value of $100 each, having a total
par value of $250,000. The parent company
has made an application to the Bank of
England for the release of $500,000, and
this money will be used to purchase the
2,500 unissued shares which remain in the
treasury at the present time. For the unissued stock the parent company proposes
paying twice the par value, namely, $200
for each share. Of the $500,000 which will
be received by the Canadian company,

MAY 29, 1958
$250,000 will be credited to the capital account and the remaining $250,000 will be
credited to the capital surplus account of
the company.
This company, the Mercantile and General
Reinsurance Company of Canada Limited,
like the majority of fire and casualty companies doing business in Canada, experienced
very heavy losses during the year 1957.
Furthermore, it is anticipated that losses will
continue during the current year, and possibly part of 1959.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Why did they lose
money?
Hon. Mr. Bruni: The companies have found
that the rates were too low for the amount
of protection that they were giving. That
is why all companies in Canada lost considerable money during 1957. I think the total
losses of all insurance companies doing business in Canada during last year amounted to
something like $70 million.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Are most of those
losses attributable to policies covering motor
vehicle accident cases?
Hon. Mr. Bruni: Every type of coverage.
The companies have even lost money on the
insurance of dwellings, which has always
been considered the cream of the insurance
business.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: That is fire insurance,
is it?
Hon. Mr. Bruni: That's right. Actually
very few fire policies are now written. They
write a composite policy, which, in addition
to protecting the insured from loss by fire,
protects him from loss by windstorm, tornadoes, water escape, and so forth.
Hon. Mr. Reid: And aircraft.
Hon. Mr. Bruni: Yes, and riots. Almost
everything imaginable is covered. These companies have really lost money and it is only
of late that they have started to increase their
rates.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Were the losses mostly
caused as a result of automobile accidents?
Hon. Mr. Bruni: I cannot answer that, but
I do know that the losses came from all
classes of business. There is no doubt that
they have had terrific losses in the automobile
insurance business. All you have to do to
realize this is to look at what has happened
to the rates in the past year.
Hon. Mr. Reid: We know that.
Hon. Mr. Bruni: The rates have increased
materially and they will have to go even
higher if the trend of present losses continues.
As a result of losses the Mercantile and

General Reinsurance Company finds that it
is in need of additional working capital, and
provision has to be made to make this available. They feel they need available capital
in addition to the $500,000 which will be
provided to the company by the issuance
of the remaining 2,500 shares that are in the
company's treasury.
Hon. Mr. Barbour: Have they increased
their premiums any?
Hon. Mr. Bruni: Yes, but this increase in
premiums has not directly affected the Canadian public, although it has indirectly. I will
cover this a little later. In addition to having
more capital to cover losses, the company
finds that it should increase its capital stock
so that as the business of the company grows
in future years it will be able to issue additional shares to provide more working capital.
The business of this company has grown
very rapidly since the company was first incorporated in Canada in 1951, with the result
that during the year 1957 the company had
a premium income of slightly over $7,300,000,
the entire premium income being derived
from reinsurance. As the name of the company implies, it is a reinsuring company. It
does not write direct business of any kind.
It has no policyholders, so to speak, but its
business consists solely of reinsuring risks for
companies which do write business on a direct
basis. The company feels that the insurance
rates in this country will be readjusted to a
satisfactory level within the next two years
and that it will be able to operate on a
profitable basis.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Where is the head
office of the company?
Hon. Mr. Bruni: The head office of the
company is in Canada.
In view of the fact that all the additional
capital of the company will be provided by
the parent company in England, this act will
allow additional English capital to be invested
in Canada, with the result that eventually
Canadian dollars will flow back to England
as the company commences and continues to
operate on a profitable basis.
According to the present intention of both
the parent company and the Canadian subsidiary company, none of the additional
capital stock will be offered for sale to the
general public. It is the intention that the
parent company in England will take up any
additional stock that is offered from time to
time.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Are there Canadian
directors?
Hon. Mr. Bruni: Oh, yes; I can give you a
list of the directors if you wish.

SENATE
Finally, I think it should be pointed out
that this bill carries the endorsement and
the approval of Mr. K. R. MacGregor, the
Superintendent of Insurance.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Can the honourable
senator tell me if when reinsurance is written
there is a fixed percentage of the premium
which goes to the reinsurance company, and
a fixed percentage stays with the company
right in the business?
Hon. Mr. Bruni: Yes.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Subject to competition
in each instance?

Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Is that not a matter
of agreement between the two companies?
Hon. Mr. Bruni: Yes, it is a matter of
agreement between them, and any company
can vary it. I mean, the reinsurance is competitive, like direct insurance. You might find
that one company would do it for 40 per cent,
while another company that was not looking
for reinsurance might say, "Well, we will take
80 per cent of the net premium for 50 per cent
of the risk." The percentage of the premium
that passes from the direct company to the
reinsuring company is decided by competition
and by supply and demand.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: The insured person
knows nothing of this reinsurance?
Hon. Mr. Bruni: Oh, no, absolutely nothing
of reinsuring.
Motion agreed to and bill read second time.

Hon. Mr. Bruni: What happens on reinsurance is this, that if you have a large risk and
your reinsure 50 per cent of it, 50 per cent of
the premium that is paid by the assured does
not go to the reinsuring company, because the
commission is paid by the company which

SPEECH FROM THE THRONE
MOTION FOR ADDRESS IN REPLYDEBATE CONTINUED
The Senate resumed from Thursday, May
29, consideration of His Excellency the Governor General's speech at the opening of the
session, and the motion of Hon. Mr. Monette,

seconded by Hon. Mr. Thorvaldson, for an
Address in reply thereto.

SENATE
Hon. Thomas Reid: Honourable senators,
in rising to take part in this debate I should
like first to compliment the honourable senator from Blaine Lake (Hon. Mr. Horner)
who is occupying the Speaker's Chair this
evening. I say most sincerely that this is a
recognition that is due him.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Reid: It is not my intention,
honourable senators, to deal extensively with
remarks which have been made by the various
speakers during this debate, because I am
speaking tonight for a particular reason which
I will develop in the latter part of my
speech. Therefore, I am going to touch upon
only one or two statements made by earlier
speakers.
First, may I say that I agreed with everything said by the Leader of the Government
(Hon. Mr. Aseltine) in his speech, with the
exception of his advocacy of the Government's
intention to proceed with the building of the
South Saskatchewan River dam. Although I
do not come from the province of Saskatchewan, I think it is the duty of every senator
to look over Canada as a whole and take
some interest in its problems. When I read
the report on the proposed dam and saw the
estimated cost of $247,500,000 for irrigating
450,000 acres of land, 75 per cent of which
is grade 2 and grade 3 land-which works
out to a cost of about $500 per acre-I began
to wonder whether, in view of our difficulty
to sell our wheat and other crops, it was
advisable to give this project any priority
or to turn to more urgent needs.
Hon. Mr. Euler:

Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. Reid: I cite one short statement
from the Gordon Commission Report: Canadian agriculture, it said, is able to meet the
demands in Canada for at least the next
ten years.
We were all interested in the statements
with regard to trade and inflation which
were made by the honourable senator from
Shelburne (Hon. Mr. Robertson). When he
mentioned that on the average wages in the
United States are 25 per cent higher than
in Canada, the thought arose in my mind
that it would be useful to know how the
per capita production in the United States
compares with that in Canada. The most
reliable figures I could find indicate that
production in the United States is 27 per
cent to 30 per cent higher than in this
country. I suggest that this is a matter
which could very well be made a subject
of inquiry, for if wages and the cost of living
continue to rise without a parallel increase

of production the time will come when
conditions in this country will be extremely
serious.
Hon. Mr. Quinn: May I ask the honourable
gentleman a question?
Hon. Mr. Reid:

Certainly.

Hon. Mr. Quinn: Would not the cause of
the difference in production be the greater
amount of automation in the United States
than in Canada?
Hon. Mr. Reid: I am not sure. As I say,
it is a subject which would be well worth
going into. I note, however, that in one
European country-Sweden, I think-an
agreement has been concluded between labour
and industry whereby, for the next three
years, labour guarantees that its productive
output will not decline. I think this is well
worth the attention of labour in this country.
I have a word or two to say regarding
proposed Government expenditures, but I
shall not elaborate at this time because there
will be opportunity for further discussion
when the budget is brought down. It seems
that we may expect an expenditure of $61
billion for the year 1958-59, or a billion
dollars more than was spent in the last year
of Liberal Government. The old age pension
security fund is now $200 million in the red,
and this year the total cost may well be $555
million, or $185 million more than last year.
I wonder what the effect on our economy
will be. Honourable senators, particularly
those on the Government side, would do well
to reflect on a statement made the other day
by Mr. Harry Truman. He was speaking at
a banquet, and naturally he was criticizing
the Eisenhower administration. When be had
finished, one man ran up to him, shook his
hand, and said, "You sure gave them hell."
Harry Truman replied, "No, I did not give
them hell: I spoke the truth, but it sounded
like hell." So, when we have to criticize,
let us remember that sometimes the truth
hurts and can "sound like hell".
Loss of trade might well affect Canada and
other great countries. I notice in a newspaper I just received from home that the
Soviets plan a huge economic bloc. Their
first step is to unite communist countries into
a single trading area so as to offer formidable
trade competition to the West. In doing so
they will be carrying out former plans laid
down by Stalin. Russia is now starting to
under-price Western countries on such
articles as aluminum and lumber. As a
matter of fact, lumbermen in British Columbia
tell me that their market for the sale of

JUNE 3, 1958
lumber to Great Britain has beeen practically closed because of the low price that
Russia is quoting on lumber to the British
people.
Honourable senators, I would like to make
a brief comment regarding the splendid
speech delivered on Thurday last by the
honourable senator from Cochrane (Hon.
Mr. Bradette). Those who were not here on
that occasion would do well to read his
speech. It has a lot of meat in it and is
very timely indeed. I will admit that I did
not catch the full significance of his remarks
until I read them, following which I personally complimented him on them. This
warning to Canadians regarding our relations
with the United States was particularly
timely. Too many people are falling into
the communistic groove, shall I say, and are
beginning to look somewhat with scorn at
the United States and to say harsh things
against the country that is our nearest and,
I claim, our best neighbour.
To support what I just said about following
the Soviet line, I wonder how many honourable senators have read a certain article
about Sergei Alexandrovich Vinogradov, who
recently left France after having served
there as Soviet Ambassador for five years.
The article reads in part as follows:
For "Vino", with the gold-toothed grin, is the
man mainly responsible for French hostility to
Washington. He's the man who started the story
that American big business wanted France out of
North Africa so that Uncle Sam could grab its oil.

No wonder Russia is gloating over the
events which have just occurred in France
and Algiers. I wouldn't be at all surprised
if the same kind of propaganda was being
sent out in every country to which a
Russian ambassador is appointed. We should
bear in mind too that we have a lot of fellow
travellers of the Soviet in this land of ours.
In his speech the honourable senator from
Cochrane referred to the last war, and I think
it should never be forgotten and should be
repeatedly told to the people of this country,
and to those who are friendly toward Russia,
that had it not been for Great Britain,
Russsia as a nation might have been nonexistent today. When France collapsed it
was expected by the Germans that Britain
would collapse too. Had that happened it
would have enabled Hitler to concentrate
his entire forces against Russia, and in my
opinion he would have conquered the entire
Soviet.
I don't know just how much attention the
people of the world pay to propaganda, but
I have long come to the conclusion that
Russia is putting it all over other countries

in the matter of disseminating propaganda.
Perhaps I have placed a wrong interpretation
on the recent letter from Krushchev to Prime
Minister Diefenbaker, but I believe I read
in it something that will make Canadians a
little more uneasy, though perhaps a little
more respectful of Britain. In the correspondence Krushchev is endeavouring to
persuade our Prime Minister to put a halt
to aircraft carrying nuclear bombs across this
country, pointing up the danger of such
flights. Many people may express fear of
this so-called danger of nuclear bombs and
so turn hostile eyes toward the United States.
No matter what the views are of each and
every honourable senator, I say that we can
thank God for the armed might of the
United States, for in my opinion it has
been the tremendous power of that country
that has saved the Western world up to the
present time.
Honourable senators, I will leave that
subject now and turn to a more pleasant one:
the British Columbia centennial.
I was
pleased to hear the honourable senator from
Saint John-Albert (Hon. Mr. Emerson) refer
to the B.C. centennial when he spoke
in this chamber recently, and as a
British Columbian I felt I could net let
this opportunity go by without saying a
word or two about it. I am particularly
proud to do so. For those of you who have
not read the history of British Columbia I
would point out that my province was discovered almost entirely by men of Sceottish
birth, who also prevented it from becoming
a part of the United States. I have here
a whole list of Sceotsmen, starting with
Mackenzie who, as a young man of 23, returned to Seotland to study astronomy. This
knowledge later served him well when he
became the first man to cross the entire
continent of North America, and the first of
course to cross the northern part of it.
Canada, as it was then known, ended at the
western boundary of Ontario.
When
Mackenzie crossed the Rockies and finally
came upon the Pacific Ocean he carved on
a tree the words "Mackenzie from Canada,
1793". This long list of distinguished Scotsmen includes such names as Findlay,
McDougall, McLeod, Governor Simpson,
McLoughlin, Simon Fraser, McTavish, Stuart,
Thompson, Ross, Finlayson. All those men
were from the land where I was born.
Hon. Mr. Bruni: What about the Irish?
Hon. Mr. Reid: It is little wonder that
when we hear people from a certain province
in Canada saying we should remove the word
"British" from the name "British Columbia"

SENATE
we reply that if they want to start another
war just let them go ahead and try to do
what they suggest. I say without fear of
giving any offence that the Scottish people
have never taken second place to any other
race in the development of this great landHon. Mr. Bruni: Except the Irish.
Hon. Mr. Reid:-because they have spread
out from Quebec to the Pacific Ocean.
Hon. Mr. MacDonald: Are there any Reids
in that list?
Hon. Mr. Reid: No, although some of my
ancestors died on the Plains of Abraham,
and that is going quite a way back. I a'm
tempted to tell a good story, and I think
I shall do so. When Scotsmen first came to
this land there were no women, and having
come here to settle and people the country,
naturally they needed wives, and so married
Indian women. When I first went to British
Columbia the law of the land was that a
man could not will his property to his wife,
because so many men had married Indian
women. I was relating to an Englishman at
one time how Scotsmen had been obliged
to marry Indian women, and he replied, "You
would not find an Englishman doing that."
I said, "No, the Indians had to draw the line
somewhere!"
Sir James Douglas was the first Governor
of Vancouver Island. When the great rush of
gold seekers came from California, from San
Francisco-some 22,000 at one time-there
was no law, so Sir James stepped in and took
charge without any authority from anyone,
ultimately depending on Great Britain to
send him the necessary authority. It was
his will to take charge, because he knew that
if he did not do so the country would be
taken in the narne of the United States.
Then in 1858 the colony of British Columbia
was founded, not far from where I live. I
believe that Langley, where the colony was
first founded, was the first place that ever
exported fish abroad, but I may be wrong.
In those days, they exported barrels of fish
to the Hawaiian Islands. In 1870 we joined
Confederation, so therefore we celebrate this
year the centennial, 1858-1958; and the good
Lord must be kind to his own people, because
in British Columbia we have been enjoying
the most wonderful weather, with not a speck
of frost or snow.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: The rain falls on
the just and the unjust!
Hon. Mr. Reid: I know, but I am speaking
very much for the just in my own province.
Honourable senators, may I change the subject for a moment? I do not know how many
honourable senators take an interest in stamp

collecting; I do in a small way. We are called
philatelists. Canada used to have wonderful
stamps until about ten years ago, but if you
speak to any philatelist nowadays he will
complain, as I am doing now, about the lack
of colour and poor design of the present
stamps. I would like to show honourable
senators what comes from other countries,
particularly from the British Commonwealth
countries, and especially Great Britain berself. Now here is a Canadian 5-cent stamp
commemorating the British Columbia centennial. A sourdough is supposed to be looking
for gold. But it is all one colour-drab. I
suggest to the Government that another committee be set up, because in the past five
or ten years some of the stamps, in my
opinion, have been just terrible.
Honourable senators, to continue on the
subject of the centennial-and the invitation
to each and every one of you to come and
join in the celebration in British Columbiawe shall in the month of October, commencing about the 10th, have one of the greatest
sights anyone will ever see, and which no
river of any other province can duplicate.
In the Adams River, running 22 miles or so
past the town of Kamloops, we expect there
will be 2 million sockeye salmon spawning
on a five or six-mile stretch. That sight
cannot be duplicated anywhere, because the
Fraser River is the greatest river for salmon
in the world.
This brings me to the subject I have particularly in mind, that is, the story of the sockeye
salmon. In repeating part of the story for
the benefit of honourable senators who may
not have heard it before, I shall, before
closing, draw attention to the great problem
which faces the present Government and the
Sockeye Commission. Five varieties of salmon
frequent the Fraser river, and they are unlike
the Atlantic salmon. Each of the five varieties
has a different life cycle; one variety has a
two-year life, another a three-year life, another a four-year life, and another a five-year.
Differing again from the Atlantic salmon,
when they come back, whether in the second,
third, fourth or fifth year, depending on the
species, they lay their eggs and then die;
their life cycle is complete. The five varieties
are chum, cohoe, spring, pink and sockeye.
The sockeye is the best salmon in a can or
tin, it has a beautiful rich red colour and
therefore is in great demand. Spring salmon,
I think, can equal the Gaspé salmon; it is
one of the best. Yes, and I would like to
challenge those who differ. It is a poor man
that would not stick up for his own province,
you know.

JUNE 3, 1958
Hon. Mr. Howard: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Reid: Now, we are f acing quite
a problem, and before dealing with that
problem I will try to streamline my remarks
and endeavour to keep the picture clear,
particularly for the new senators who have
not heard anything about sockeye salmon.
I repeat that the Fraser River is the greatest
sockeye salmon stream in the entire world.
We met with disaster in 1913 when the contractors building the railway through to
British Columbia blew down part of a mountain into the waters at the place they call
Hells Gate Canyon, and in that year few
fish got through the canyon to spawn. There
is one characteristic of the sockeye salmon
that the others do not have-they will not
lay their eggs in any other gravel bar but
the gravel bar where they were born. So
in 1913, when hundreds of thousands of tons
of rock fell into the canyon, some 90 feet
wide and 190 feet deep, where the Fraser
goes through the gorges of the mountains,
very few salmon got through Hells Gate
Canyon in that year. This may sound a tall
story, but I am giving the facts, which I
know because I happen to be chairman of
the International Pacific Salmon Fisheries
Commission, set up by the two governments
of Canada and the United States in the year
1937. I am now the sole remaining original
member on that commission, so I should
know something of this subject. In 1913
there were canned 2j million cases of sockeye salmon alone, and it was estimated that
10 million sockeye salmon were on the way
to the spawning grounds that year when
most of them were blocked at Hells Gate
Canyon. Two and a half million cases
meant that 25 million sockeye, eight or so
lbs. in weight and of goodly size, were
caught and canned, and 10 million headed
for the up-river spawning grounds.
The department made an attempt to clear
out the rocks but it was not entirely successful. And then we had to wait until we
reached an agreement with the United States
before we could set up the Sockeye Commission now in existence.
Someone might ask, "What has the United
States got to do with British Columbia
rivers?" Well, the situation is that we are
on the rearing end. Those salmon are reared
in the Fraser River and in the lakes, but when
the salmon come back to spawn the Americans are on the catching end and we could
not very well go ahead and spend millions
of dollars trying to rehabilitate the lost runs
of salmon as long as the Americans outside
were able to catch the fish that we had
reared. So in 1937 the two countries finally
signed a treaty, under which we were given

powers to rehabilitate, to extend and bring
back again the once great runs of salmon
of the Fraser River, with the added duty of
dividing the catch equally between the
Americans and ourselves.
And may I say that we are very proud of
the regulating end of it. We have been operating in the dividing of the fish since 1946, but
in the first four years we were not allowed
to regulate, we were limited to investigation
work. We have not been out more than 4
per cent in the division between the two
countries, which I think is extremely remarkable when you realize that these salmon
runs are spread over many, many months.
Now, one could speak at great length on
this, but I am endeavouring to streamline
it, or shorten it, shall I say. We have difficulty
even in British Columbia in getting people
to understand that the sockeye salmon is not
the spring salmon or the cohoe or the pink.
You can do with some of those other species
what you cannot do with the sockeye.
May I say we have had lots of helpbiological, scientific and engineering-and
both the United States Government and the
Canadian Government have been generous,
so if we did not know anything now there
would be something radically wrong somewhere. We have been at the work a long
time and have found many of the answers
regarding the Sockeye and as to what should
be done. At the present time we have reached
the point of rehabilitating the equivalent of
about 56 per cent of the 1913 catch.
The Hells Gate Canyon problem has been
solved. It was solved by building fishways
through it-not fish ladders, but fishwaysat a cost of $2 million, of which $1 million
was paid by the United States and $1 million
by Canada. I might say that the installation
of those fishways forms the basis of a real
story. It took us some years to find out just
why the salmon were blocked from going
through the canyon. What was the reason,
we asked? Well, we found out that when the
water in the canyon was at a height of 140
feet the salmon could go through on their
own, but when it rose above 140 to 152 feet
or more the result was the same as if you
dropped an iron gate across the river-not
one fish could get through. So we built
fishways along the walls of the canyon in
order that when the water rose to 140 feet
and upwards to 152 feet the fish would be
able to find an easy passage through the
fishways. A series of baffles was constructed
so as to cut the velocity of the canyon waters
from roughly some 25 miles an hour to 7 or
8 miles an hour in the fishways.
The fishways are 40 feet high and 60 feet
wide, and one of them is 260 feet long. If

SENATE
any honourable senators visit British Columbia I would be delighted to take them up and
show them the fishways, which are well
worth a visit. We have had visitors from
many countries, including Russia and Japan,
to see these fishways, and of course many
hundreds of our own people and hundreds
of United States citizens as well have come
to see them.
Now, here is the problem: a demand has
arisen in British Columbia for more power,
and it has been suggested that the waters
of the Columbia River be turned into the
Fraser River. I probably may have some
harsh things to say about General McNaughton butHon. Mr. Euler: Is he a Scotsman too?
Hon. Mr. Reid: He does not always act
like one. That may be a right answer too.
Hon. Mr. Bruni: That is an unfair question!
Hon. Mr. Reid: Before the House of Commons Standing Committee on External Affairs
General McNaughton made false and misleading statements and I feel that, he having
put them on the record of Parliament-you
need not shake your head, as I said this outside-that as Chairman of the Commission I
have a duty to correct some of the misleading
statements he made. I have suggested to the
Minister of Fisheries and to other members
as well that if the External Affairs Committee of the House of Commons again meets and
General McNaughton is called as a witness
and the subject under consideration is power
and fish I hope they will be good enough to
request our Director to appear before that
committee too, so that someone who is an
authority and has knowledge of the salmon
fisheries on the Fraser will be there to tell
them the actual facts and give them the right
and truthful answers.
Now, honourable senators, I have all the
records here. I am not just taking this matter
up loosely and merely saying that the General
made false and misleading statements-I have
all the records with me, the record of the
committee meetings, the pages and so forth.
He first of all said, as reported on page 258
of the report of the minutes of proceedings
and evidence of the External Affairs Committee meeting held on December 12, 1957,
that power costs in Vancouver were twice
what they were in Seattle because of the
non-development of the Fraser River hydro
power. I claim of course that that was false
and misleading.
We will never have cheap power around
Vancouver as long as the British Columbia
Electric Company is there, and I am going to
show you why. The British Columbia Electric Power Company runs a bus system and
transit system in the city of Vancouver, and

those of us who pay our electric light billsand we all have to do that-are carrying the
loss on the buses. In eleven years they lost
$40 million in revenue. This figure appeared
in Maclean's magazine a short time ago. I
think I know what I am speaking of now.
Maybe some of you have shares in British
Columbia Electric Company and might not
like it, but the truth must be told, and I am
giving you the whole story. I am speaking
the truth, as Harry Truman said.
Hon. Mr. Bruni: Did you say $40 million
was lost in one year?
Hon. Mr. Reid: No, in eleven years. Maclean's magazine carried that story. I will give
you the date of the issue in which all those
things are shown up.
We do not have to go any further than
Ottawa to observe the difficulties that bus
systems find themselves in. Soon people will
not be able to ride the buses here, if losses
continue.
I am giving you the sources of my information. I thought my honourable friend
or someone else would like to interrupt me
and tell me I was not stating the facts, but
I have a letter from an official of the
British Columbia Electric Company which
says that they are losing money on the buses
and should charge a 25-cent fare instead of
15 cents. That letter is from one of the head
men of the company. If you want to hear it
I will read it. The cheapest power in British
Columbia comes from the British Columbia
Power Commission.
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: The same company?
Hon. Mr. Reid: No. The British Columbia
Power Commission is set up much like the
Ontario Hydro-Electric Power Commission.
These two British Columbia bodies are confusing: one is the British Columbia Power
Commission, the other the British Columbia
Power Corporation.
Then General McNaughton gave an erroneous figure to the committee regarding the value
of the fish. In 1955 the commission of which
I am a member spent a whole morning
with General McNaughton, in this very building, and placed before him the official figures
on the annual run of fish and its value,
yet when he got before the committee he
took some millions off the figure. Indeed, I
have a copy of the official document I
personally handed to him in front of the
then Minister of Fisheries and other officials.
General McNaughton informed the committee
that the problem of dams and fish had been
solved in the United States. At the end of
the record of the proceedings of the Committee on External Affairs there appears a
document from the United States, which
document does not say any such thing. But
General McNaughton told the committee the

JUNE 3, 1958
problem had been solved in the United States
and there was no one there could contradict
him. As you know, the General is quite an
engineer and quite a forceful speaker, and
can put over a good story. In this instance
he did put over a good story, so much so
that those who are out to build dams on
the Fraser River and destroy the salmon
are corresponding with him and he with
them.
The British Columbia Power Commission
is trying to grab the entire Chilko Lake in
the interior. We had some little difficulty
with that body over a letter they sent to
the Minister of Fisheries. General McNaughton
read the entire letter from the Minister of
Fisheries into the record, but he never read
the reply from the minister or the commission to the British Columbia Power Commission. He left that out, and I say he left
it out deliberately, because he came right
out later with this statement: dam the Fraser
River first, and if any sacrifice is to be made,
let it be the salmon.
I quite realize that General McNaughton
may have done some good when he talked
about diverting the waters of the Columbia
River into the Fraser River, because of the
trouble he was having with the Americans.
That matter is so involved at the present
time I would not attempt to discuss it here.
Suffice it to say, the Columbia River commences in British Columbia, goes north for
a distance and then turns south and flows
through the United States, emptying into
the sea at the city of Portland. The United
States has pretty well developed the river
south of the border, but that part of the
country is short of power.
This Columbia River trouble all started
when a man by the name of Kaiser negotiated with the Province of British Columbia
for power rights in certain waters. It was
then that the federal Government intervened and passed a law preventing anyone
from exporting power without the authority
of the
federal
Government.
General
McNaughton, as chairman of the International Joint Commission, was given the
task of having the waters investigated for
hydro-electric power.
I complained, and I still feel a little peeved
about the fact, that the former administration handed the British Columbia Electric
Company some $280,000 to help them find
dam sites for themselves. Think of it! A
firm called British Columbia Engineering
Company, a subsidiary of the British
Columbia Electric Company, was given
$280,000 to help find dam sites. When the
proposal to the provincial Government was
made by the Kaiser interests it was then
the federal Government stepped in and
stopped the proposed deal.
Then the

Americans refused to consider Canada's
rights on the Columbia. Later General
McNaughton proposed to divert the waters
of the Columbia into the Fraser and to build
ten dams on the Fraser. The idea was to
dam the waters of the Columbia River at a
place called Mica Creek, and when the
waters of the Fraser River were low, as they
are at certain months of the year, water
would be let out through a 19-mile tunnel
from the Columbia River into the Fraser
River. Al these proposed ten dams would
generate hydro-electric power.
When this proposal became known to us
we pointed out that its development would
mean the extinction of the sockeye salmon,
if not all salmon. We had discovered that
if the salmon were delayed in their voyage
between the mouth of the river and the
spawning beds for more than 12 days they
were lost. Bear in mind, the sockeye salmon
have a date with destiny: when they enter
the mouth of the river and encounter fresh
water they cease to eat and must live off
their fat. In some instances they travel as
far as 850 miles to reach the spawning bed.
So, as I pointed out, if anything interferes
with them or blocks them they will not
spawn, but die with the eggs in them. This
is what our scientists and biologists learned
when they were investigating the facts about
Hells Gate. Ten dams, of whatever height,
would entirely block the fish and they would
never reach their spawning beds.
We also pointed out that turning the
waters of the Columbia River, which are
glacial waters, and contain no fish food
known as plankton, into the Fraser River,
would also wipe out the spawning beds in
the interior.
May I pause to tell an interesting story
about the experience of the Province of Ontario and the use of plankton for fish. About
four years ago Ontario asked us if we would
hatch one million eggs from the salmon
known as Pink. We hatched the million eggs,
which were to be used as an experiment in
Hudson Bay. Well, that experiment has not
turned out very well. One of the reasons, so
it is believed, for the scarcity of fish in Hudson Bay is the lack of plankton in its glacial
waters. So water is not simply water, nor is
salmon simply .salmon. One bas to know the
variety, and specify the variety rather than
give a general classification, and one has to
consider also the water in which the fish are
to live.
We are often accused of not experimenting
enough. Let me say that we had a three-year
experiment on a 280-foot dam in the United
States, where we found that there was a
mortality rate of 64 per cent among the
fingerlings passing over the dam, and 34 per

hatcheries.
I have referred to the money which has
been spent by the federal department, the
Fisheries Research Board and ourselves. This
year over a million dollars will be expended
in research. When we pointed this out to
some who favour dam-building, one said,
"Why don't you allow the dam to be built
and then find out what happens?" To my
mind that is, I am almost inclined to say,
a foolish question, because if such a dam
were built there would be no sockeye left;
the fisheries would be finished.
You may ask what is to be done to provide
power. My answer is that enough power can
be developed in the eastern and southern
part of British Columbia, without interfering with the Fraser River, to serve six million people. The population of the province
at present is 1,300,000. I dispute the claim

cent among those passing through the turbines. That is something we do know; it is
not a guess. The actual facts which I am
presenting come to us from our biologists and
engineers. So, I repeat, the building of dams
on the Fraser River will wipe out the salmon
fishing industry.
Statements have been made that we are
not doing enough to find an answer for the
problem of dams. Those who are advocating
the development of power on the Fraser
River say, why do you not spend more money
to find a solution? It might surprise honourable senators to know just how much has
been spent: many millions have been spent
both by the United States and Canada in an
attempt to find a satisfactory solution of the
problem. There are at this time some one hundred biologists and other scientists whose task
it is to try to find how best to take salmon
over dams and take fingerlings down, and I
can say without fear of successful contradic-

value?
Hon. Mr. Reid: Manufactured value. There
is of course a difference between what the
fisherman gets and the price paid for what is
sold over the counter,-much the same as the
difference between the price of cattle, and
that of processed beef. Yet there are those
who want to wipe out this production of 150
million pounds, when ample power requirements can be obtained without interfering
with the Fraser River at all.
Bear in mind that, according to an estimate
by the United Nations organization, in 50
years the world's population will have
doubled. So if there is anything of which we
should be careful, surely it is our food supply.
All the food which can be produced will be
required; you can eat salmon, but you cannot
eat a kilowatt.
I could have gone on at greater length, but
my particular purpose is simply to draw attention to the statements; or misstatements, made
by General McNaughton. It makes me a little
wrathful to find him co-operating with interests in British Columbia which are trying
with hyper-subtlety to put over the idea of
having hydro-electric dams in the Fraser
River and so destroying our heritage of
salmon. He is corresponding with these interests and they are using his name to support their plans.
One final warning to the Government and
General McNaughton is that, while it might
have been laudable on his part to try to bring
the Americans to time, it may in the long run
prove rather disastrous. After all, the Premier
of British Columbia is going to have the final
say in this question. As I have repeatedly
said, what the federal Government has been
doing in British Columbia it would never
attempt in Quebec; Duplessis would have been
on its neck at once. I say that without fear
of successful contradiction. The federal Government has been getting away with murder
out in British Columbia. Mr. Bennett is now
doing in his way what General McNaughton
did in his. General McNaughton used the plan
to divert the waters from the Columbia to
the Fraser with a view to bringing the
Americans to time, and now Mr. Bennett has
something else to use as a club. It is almost
certain that the Swedish-based Wenner-Gren
interests will be given the right to develop
all the horsepower in what we call the Rocky
Mountain Trench. We are a little suspicious,
of course, as to what is behind all this; but
these interests claim there is sufficient power
in that area to develop some 4 million horsepower. Because of this, Mr. Bennett feels
he does not have to go and dicker with United

States interests as to power on the Columbia.
Now, all this could result in a very complicated problem.
For some reason or other a report which
was presented to the Government last December was denied us. I don't know why. I
claimed at that time, as I have done on many
occasions with regard to reports, that as a
member of Parliament I had a right to ask
for a copy of the report. After all, the people
of Canada paid to have it prepared. The
Government claimed it had good reasons for
withholding the report and so refused to
divulge its contents.
American engineers have their views on
power development on the Columbia River.
Mr. Bennett has his views and he has given
a straight statement, which I am keeping close
at hand in case he should change it. He says
that as long as he is Premier of British
Columbia there will be no dam on the Columbia River until the fish problem has been
solved.
Honourable senators, in getting this whole
matter cleared up I cannot see how the federal
Government can try to make any headway
with American interests and at the same time
keep ignoring the province of British Columbia. The Premier has felt that he has been
left out so much that he has put his own
engineers on the job and so is not going
to accept General McNaughton's statement.
Just when the whole matter will be finally
cleaned up I don't know. They may never
divert the waters from the Columbia, but
we cannot take a chance on it. It all started
out with General McNaughton wanting to
bring the Americans to time, and there is
no doubt that it did wake them up, but when
he turned around and said to get rid of the
salmon, and when he made false and misleading statements, placing these on the records
of Parliament, I felt it was my duty to get up
and place the truth of the matter on the
official record.

Hon.

J.

G.

Diefenbaker

(Prime

Minister of Canada): Mr. Speaker and members of both houses of the Parliament of
Canada: I welcome the President of the
Federal Republic of Germany on this unique
occasion, unique in that it is the first time
that the Parliament of Canada has been addressed, and indeed it is the first time that
North America has been visited, by a head
of state of Germany.
President Heuss was a member of parliament for seven years. He was been a statesman, a professor of history and political
science, a publicist and editor, a biographer
and author.
Canada is a land of recent immigrants as
measured in the perpective of human
history, and they and their descendants have
learned to live together in amity and brotherhood in this land. While the basic racial
stocks are French and English, Canada is a
land of
many races
who have all
made their contribution to our traditions and
development.
It is of interest to recall that the first of
these races who came in the wake of the
early French and British colonizers were
some 2,300 persons from the Palatinate and
the upper Rhine who betwen 1750 and 1752
were settled in Nova Scotia under a colonization plan of George III. They were followed by
others of your race, sir, who -came to Canada
after the revolutionary war in large numbers
from what today is the United States of
America. Even at the time of Confederation
there were within our country around 200,000
people of German origin. Today that number
amounts to some 800,000 who have come and
have made their citizenship here in keeping
with the traditions of the other races who
have joined together to comprise the people
of Canada.

We meet here under unusual circumstances

indicative of the fact that there is no finality
in history; for that partnership that now exists
among the United Kingdom, France, the
United States, Canada and the other nations
of NATO, including Germany and Italy, is
indicative of those changes that have taken
place in binding together the freedom-loving
peoples of mankind.
During the presidency of our distinguished

guest and under the wise statemanship of
Chancellor Adenauer, the Federal Republic of
Germany joined and is now one of the major
members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. I believe that what these nations
have been able to attain in understanding
and co-operation will in the years ahead, if
our faith is maintained, permit a like development of freedom under law for mankind, a worthy and attainable objective.
We believe with you that the free world
must maintain its defences. We believe that
the subjugation of defenceless nations on

global proportions by force, infiltration and
economic penetration makes it necessary that
nations co-operate. Our experience in the
past, of course, has been that pacts of themselves are insufficient. Deeds are needed as
well as words, and for that reason Canada
maintains the Canadian infantry brigade in
the Soest area in Germany and bases for its

air forces in Germany and France, and under
the mutual aid program we train in Canada
considerable
personnel.

numbers of German air

crew

We believe that further attention and consideration to the principles of economic cooperation inherent in article 2 of the NATO
treaty is necessary if NATO is to meet successfully the changing forms of Soviet influence.

JUNE 3, 1958
We have intensive trade relations with
Germany. We are co-operating in the fields
of atomic energy, taxation and civil aviation.
Believing that the preservation of human
freedom-I know that the members of Parliament have the same view, and that you
share that view-transcends all other considerations, Canadians intend to nurture that
spirit of good will with all like-minded nations. We reaffirm our belief in and support
for the North Atlantic Treaty Organization
as a defensive organization dedicated to peace
and with no offensive objectives. I wish to
make it clear that whatever threats may
be made against those nations which believe
in the mission of NATO and the necessity
for its continuance, Canada will maintain
forces in Europe as long as international
disquiet and justifiable fears require Canadian participation.
My hope is that if the Western world will
maintain its unity of purpose and will not
weary in its pursuit of peace with freedom,
however uncertain and hesitant the steps to
that objective may appear to be, that peace
with justice under law will have been
achieved.
It is in that spirit, sir, that I welcome
you to the Parliament of Canada in this
chamber with representatives of the Senate
and the House of Commons present. We welcome you for the stands you have taken since
assumption of the presidency of Germany
in 1949, for that spirit of understanding and
co-operation which has characterized your
state. It is in that spirit that I welcome
President Theodor Heuss, President of the
Federal Republic of Germany, and now ask
him to speak.
Professor Dr. Theodor Heuss (President of
the Federal Republic of Germany): Mr.
Speaker of the Senate, Mr. Speaker of the
House of Commons, Honourable Members of
the Senate and Members of the House of
Commons: Permit me first to express my
thanks to the Canadian people on my visit to
Canada. I wish them to understand that
my ability to speak English or French is
not indicative of the depth of my feelings.
I am sorry that I have not had practice in
speaking foreign languages, either English
or French, and I must ask your indulgence
to permit me to speak to you in German.
Permettez-moi de continuer en allemand.
(Translation)
I thank His Excellency, the Right Honourable Vincent Massey, Governor General of
Canada, and the Canadian Government for
their kind invitation to visit Canada.
I have asked the Governor General to
convey my greetings to your Queen, Her
Majesty Elizabeth II, and tell her how happy

I am to become acquainted with this important and beautiful country and member
of her commonwealth.
I hold it a great honour to be permitted
to speak in this illustrious house, which is
at once a home and a model of the democratic spirit.
My words are at the same time addressed
to the people of Canada, to whom I wish to
extend cordial greetings from the German
people. May I accompany these greetings
by my sincere thanks for the friendly reception accorded me everywhere since my
arrival in this great country.
Throughout the centuries preceding our
own, which has brought such tragedy to the
peoples of the world, relations between
Germany, whatever her form of government, and Canada were of a peaceful nature.
Then followed the two world wars, the
first brought about by political misunderstanding and ineptitude, the second by evil
and arrogant worship of power.
We cannot ignore these historical events
which claimed so many vicitims and caused
so much bloodshed. I still remember the
war memorial honouring the Canadian
soldiers who fell in Northern France in 1917
and 1918.
Out of these many battles there emerged
mutual respect for soldierly gallantry, and
then the understanding that it would be
better to live with one another, yes! for one
another! For it must not be forgotten that
we have the same spiritual heritage and a
great deal in common both intellectually
and culturally.
Alas! Our generation knows all too well
that campaigns and wars may have been
brought to a victorious conclusion, but that
peace has not yet been won.
The fear lurking in the souls of many
nations is the result of political or military
decisions still prompted by old wartime passions and worries.
We in Germany have many reasons to be
grateful to the Canadian Government and
the people of Canada for their early and
unwavering understanding.
We appreciate what it means for Canada
to maintain soldiers on German soil, to afford
an opportunity to young German pilots to
familiarize themselves with the constantly developing aircraft techniques, and to recognize
and support the German people's demand for
reunification by peaceful, democratic means.
The North Atlantic Treaty Organization,
of which both our countries and peoples are
loyal members, is the political expression of
mutual solidarity.
Due to the times we live in, this Treaty
at first had military and even strategic
aspects. But it is growing out of that stage,

SENATE

and this in itself refutes all Eastern propaganda claiming that it is a kind of aggressors' plot.
The political and economic traditions and
aspirations embodied in this Treaty are much
too diversified for anything like that.
Canada, with her wide-open spaces, and
ber rich resources waiting to be tapped, is
developing her own historical rhythm. But
she nevertheless still remains linked to
Europe through the origin of ber inhabitants
belonging to separate language and cultural
groups and stemming from ber formative
period and through the immigrants who
bravely faced the risks of the new environment or, driven from the soil of their forefathers, established a new home here. What
thousandfold opportunities many of them
found in this land, especially the Germans
expelled from southeastern Europe.
Here, where vast space fashions its own
laws, it will also be appreciated that Free
Europe and, in the not too distant future it
is hoped, the other Europe which, together,
we historically consider as an indivisible
whole, is developing the elements of its unity
in the economic, social as well as the spiritual
and cultural flelds, despite its present division.
These are the questions which find their
expression in concepts such as EURATOM,
Common Market and Free Trade Area, but I
cannot enlarge on their problems at this
time and place. I think that the progress
they represent is also appreciated in this
country.
The psychological and political background
of all this is the fact that the convulsions
which characterized the relations between
Germany and France for centuries have now
been eliminated, after terrible experiences.
German youth has understood this to be
an essential to the future of Europe.
cultivates
Germany,
which gratefully
friendly relations with the United Kingdom
and the countries in the North, West and
South, has given herself authority in ber
Constitution to renounce ber traditional
national sovereignty.
The days spent here have made me richer
in understanding, as I have viewed venerable
and historic Quebec; seen the living present
of Toronto and Montreal and had the incomparable experience of seeing the St. Lawrence
Seaway and Niagara Falls. And I know
you will not mind my quiet feeling of pride
when I think that 60 years ago, when the
Falls were first harnessed to generate power,
it was my native province that supplied the
first turbines.
In closing, allow me to say that this
country offers immense opportunities for all
those who face the future unafraid, and who

humanity in its efforts to give prosperity to,
everyone and to preserve peace among the
nations.
Such is my fervent hope.
Translation:
Hon. Mark Robert Drouin (Speaker of the
Senate): Mr. President, allow me to say toyou, on behalf of the members of the Senate
of Canada, how very pleased we are to have
you with us at this time and to express our
gratitude for the admirable address which
you have just delivered.
We have had, on previous occasions, the
great honour of greeting, in this very chamber, a number of remarkable statesmen,
particularly from the commonwealth, from
the neighbouring republic and from France.
We are happy and proud, at this time, to be
able to add your name to that memorable
list of the best friends of our country and of
the outstanding personalities of the free
world.
The German people could not have chosen
a better ambassador than yourself, Mr.
President. We were already aware of your
qualities of heart and mind, but we had
yet to enjoy your great personal charm and
to enter into bonds of friendship with the
first citizen of that Germany which has
become, not only a true friend but a precious
ally in that gigantic struggle which is being
waged since the end of the last war for the
defence of peace and of freedom. We are
glad of this opportunity which has been
provided by your Government.
Our friendship with your beautiful country
is an established fact. A substantial part
of our population is of German origin.
Naturally, for that very reason, that group
has preserved a deep affection for Germany.
But, moreover, no one can be unaware of
all which your country has contributed
through the centuries and still contributes
today, to science, music, literature, philosophy
and the various aspects of technical knowledge.
In addition, our two countries are solemnly
associated in the North Atlantic Treaty to
face any emergency. They are thus closely
linked within the Western community where
Germany's influence, I am glad to point out,
is increasingly being felt. We are therefore
basically united by our common attachment
to the same ideals and political principles.
In this regard it gives me pleasure to mention your personal contribution to the development and drafting of the democratically
inspired Constitution of the Federal Republic
of Germany, before you were elected first
as a member of the Bundestag and then
President of the republic.

JUNE 3, 1958
While we are already closely bound in the
political, commercial and cultural spheres,
we trust that this co-operation between our
two countries, in facing current problems, will
continue to grow in the future. Your visit, I
am sure, reflects your country's determination to persevere in this course.
Mr. President, please convey our best
wishes to the German people as well as to
the members of the Government and of the
Parliament of the Federal Republic of Germany. Tell them, particularly, on our behalf,
that our most sincere wish is that they may,
very soon, with the help of the other free
nations, raise the iron curtain which now
divides them and prevents them from uniting freely.
Hoping that your visit to Canada will be
enjoyable to you all, we wish you a pleasant
journey home and many more years of fruitful life.
(Text):
Hon. Roland Michener (Speaker of the
House of Commons): Mr. Bundes President:
On behalf of the House of Commons and the
Canadian people whom we are representing,
although not exclusively I should say in the
presence of so many senators, may I express
to Your Excellency our lively appreciation
of the honour which you do us by your visit.
You will appreciate from this second address
of thanks that we are a bilingual country of
English and French origins. After these two
basic groups the third largest element in our
population is of German descent. Many of
these are third and fourth generation Canadians and some, such as those who founded
Lunenburg, already mentioned, have a much
deeper Canadian background.

As you have discovered on your recent visit
to Toronto, this ethnie bond between our
countries has been strengthened in the last
ten years by an influx of many thousands
of your countrymen. These latter, and to a
lesser extent the descendants of the earlier
German settlers, will appreciate your message in the words in which it was spoken; but
all Canadians will welcome, in translation,
the friendly message of greetings which you
have brought us from the Federal Republic of
Germany.
What you have said is not only welcome
but important. Our future, as well as the
peace and -progress of much of mankind,
will be affected in no small degree by the
course which is taken by the German people,
with their great capacities for work, invention and the arts of peace and war.
The world has shrunk since the first German immigrants came here in sailing ships.
With modern transport you have had a
quicker and, we trust, a more comfortable
passage. Nevertheless from Bonn to Ottawa
is still a long journey to be undertaken by
one of your high position and responsibilities.
On that account we are the more grateful
to you for having come.
By your presence you have not only imparted to your message the integrity and purpose which have been exemplified in your
illustrious career, but you have given us the
opportunity of closer acquaintance with one
of the great men of modern Europe.
We wish you happiness in your visit and a
safe return to Bonn. Will you take home
with you the thanks and cordial greetings of
the House of Commons of Canada.
I conclude with words which most Canadians will understand and which all would
wish to apply to your visit: Danke schön und
auf Wiedersehen.

SPEECH FROM THE THRONE
ADDRESS IN REPLY-DEBATE CONTINUED
The Senate resumed from yesterday consideration of His Excellency the Governor
General's speech at the opening of the session,
and the motion of Hon. Mr. Monette, seconded

JUNE 4, 1958
by Hon. Mr. Thorvaldson, for an Address in
reply thereto.
Hon. John J. MacDonald: Honourable
senators, I know that you all are gazing
on me because you realize this is my first
address in the Senate. May I at this moment,
like those who have preceded me, extend to
the Honourable the Speaker my sincerest
congratulations upon his re-election as
Speaker of this house. May I also extend
my heartiest congratulations to the mover
and to the seconder of the Address. Both these
gentlemen, no doubt, are learned in the law,
and could not fail to do full justice to an
occasion of this kind.
I greatly appreciate, too, the privilege of
extending congratulations to the Honourable
the Leader of the Opposition (Hon. Mr.
Macdonald), who recently delivered here
such a fair-minded address. There was an
old friend of mine, now dead, who I know
would have liked nothing better than to have
joined in this expression of appreciation. I
refer to the late W. Chester MeLure, who
spent 12 years as a member of the House
of Commons. It is, of -course, also my
privilege at this time to appreciate the leadership of our present and, I hope, future
Leader of the Government here (Hon. Mr.
Aseltine). He has an amiable disposition;
I know he wants to be fair, and it is his aim,
I believe, to maintain here a happy family
atmosphere, although, no doubt, as in the
best of families, "ruckuses" will strike up
occasionally.
I may recall that on May 12, at the opening of the session here, I was escorted into
the chamber to take the oath and be introduced to the Honourable the Speaker. Afterwards, as I sat waiting for the others to be
introduced, I looked around me and said to
myself: "Heavens, I am gazing at men who
are university graduates, men learned in
law, in business, in medicine, and what have
you. Here am I: the only degree that I can
boast of is a degree from that great university
of hard knocks and experience." I found out
a few days afterwards that I was not alone
in that respect, and in saying so I have in
mind an honourable friend of mine across
the way. And I hope, as a certain timidity
wears off, I shall be able to follow along
with some degree of acceptance.
Perhaps I may be pardoned for saying I
have been around a little bit. I recall back
in 1914, when as a resident of the province of
Alberta I had some flair for local politicsI was not too young then, either-I happened
to drop into the local Legislature during what
was, I believe, the short session which followed the beginning of World War I. There
I listened to a young man seconding the
Address in reply to the Speech from the

Throne; and who was it but our honourable
colleague from Cariboo (Hon. Mr. Turgeon).
So he comes from the West and I come from
the East.
I would like to mention another fact. I
know that this will not be of much interest
to most of you but I am sort of filling in,
building up to the point where I get into the
meat of what I want to talk about. I recall
that the Leader of the Opposition in the
Legislature that day was no less a person
than Edward Michener, who was always busy
advocating the rights and principles of the
party to which I happened to belong. He later
was appointed to this chamber and was probably an associate for some years of many of
you here. Today I find that his son, the
Honourable Roland Michener, is Speaker of
the House of Commons, and I would not be
at all surprised if after a few years he also
is appointed to this chamber.
I suppose it is a little late in the year to
be paying certain compliments, but irrespective of my political affiliations I would like
to pay tribute to the Honourable Lester B.
Pearson, the Leader of Her Majesty's loyal
Opposition in the House of Commons. I am
sure that most Canadians were proud of Mr.
Pearson when he was awarded the Nobel
Peace Prize. I am broadminded enough to
say that although I am not of his political
following I was proud of his achievement. It
was quite a compliment to all of Canada
when Mr. Pearson went to Oslo, Norway,
to receive his award. Incidentally, Oslo is
situated near the 60th parallel, and it is
interesting to know that many densely populated cities such as Stockholm, Helsinki
and Leningrad are located near the 60th
parallel as it crosses their respective countries.
I am just going to leave this topie for
the moment and drift to something else.
Probably you will think I am going to get into
partisan politics. I want to avoid this subject
but at the same time I want to recall that on
March 31 last the party of the Right Honourable John Diefenbaker was elected by a huge
majority. Many Liberal members who sat
in the House of Commons after the election of
June 10, 1957 failed to come back after the
election of March 31, and their supporters,
like many supporters of the C.C.F. party and
the Social Credit party, apparently got behind
the Conservative party. As honourable senators will remember, one of the chief planks
in Mr. Diefenbaker's platform was the pushing back of the frontiers toward the north,
toward the 60th parallel. I want to quote
some figures to honourable senators. Incidentally, I am not yet able to identify all
honourable senators by their constituencies
but I can name them. Men who, like the
honourable senator from Churchill (Hon. Mr.
Crerar), have spent many years in the House

SENATE
of Commons and in the Senate, probably
would not feel it necessary to give figures like
these, showing the growth in Canada's total
population and revenue. I had to do a little
research in this respect, and I am going back
only to 1891. The figures for that year and
for every tenth year thereafter are as
follows:
Total
population
of Canada
4,833,000
5,371,000
7,207,000
8,788,000
10,377,000
11,507,000
14,009,000
16,589,000

Total federal revenues
for fiscal year ending
March 31
$ 38,579,000
52,515,000
117,780,000
436,292,000
356,160,000
872,170,000
3,112,536,000
5,106,541,000

I relate those figures, honourable senators,
because I feel that our population, which is
up to 17 million now, is going to expand so
fast that, when I look back, I think the Right
Honourable John Diefenbaker had the right
idea that perhaps it was about time to start
a move on the frontiers a little farther afield.
While I am on that topic, let me say: May
God help him, give him the best of health
and continued wisdorn to carry on his great
responsibilities.

I listened with a great deal of pleasure, a
few days ago, to the honourable senator from
Shelburne (Hon. Mr. Robertson)-and do not
imagine for a moment that I am criticizing
or going to draw any fire from anywhere, for
I will never attempt to do that-and I think
his main theme was the high cost of living.
Well, I agree with him there, and there is
no difference between us in that respect. I
think-and I suppose the Canadian Press is
represented here-that though there may be
isolated cases where labour is not getting
enough, probably 75 per cent of the labour
population of this country is at its peak, and
I think that they would be well advised to
hold the line. I will make that statement.
However, what can be done about the cost of
living otherwise-just what can be done about
it? That is the crucial problem. Just whether
this Price Spreads Commission can bring up
an answer or not remains to be seen, so I
am afraid I shall have to leave it at that for
the time being.
Honourable senators, I listened very attentively and tried to follow the honourable
senator from New Westminster (Hon. Mr.
Reid) last evening. I am going to throw two
challenges at him. They are not of a political
nature.

I

can well

remember

that

when

World War I ended I took a trip to Glasgow,
and I felt bound to visit the home of Robbie
Burns, to whom we do honour and justice on
January 25. If the honourable senator ever
goes back there and looks back to about the

last of March 1919, he will find my name in
the visitors' book.
Hon. Mr. Reid: I will look for it next year.
Hon. Mr. MacDonald: The honourable senator spoke about salmon. To him I would say,
"You hang on to them, and I will stand by
the lobster."
Hon. Mr. Reid: Or the lobster will hang
on to you!
Hon. Mr. MacDonald: Honourable senators,
I suppose I would be very much remiss in my
duty if I did not mention a certain gentleman
whose name comes down from many generations and centuries ago-a man of wit,
whose name was "Pat". He coined the phrase,
"Everyone for his own country". That is what
I am going to speak about now, and I am
going to ask honourable senators to join with
me and we will get down to Prince Edward
Island.
Prince Edward Island is sometimes known
as the Cradle on the Wave. It is known also
as the little Kentucky of Canada, on account
of its horseracing. It is noted for its lovely
beaches-and any person who wants to spend
a holiday would be well advised to get down
to what we call the north shore and spend
a couple of weeks there-for surf bathing,
good beaches, and anything you want; for its
well-tilled farmlands and, on the whole, wellkept farm buildings. Although we have a
national park there, it was said at one time
that the whole island is a national park.
Honourable senators, that is the rosy part of
it. The economic story is quite different. The
majority of our young men are leaving us,
probably for financial reasons. You probably
cannot go into any nook and corner of Canada
and not find-and I question if this is not
truc also in the United States-men and
women from Prince Edward Island in any
profession you can think of-the law, the
church, and many, many others. That is about
all we are doing in Prince Edward Island,
exporting brains, and the sad part of it is
that the old family farm is let go. Just what
can be done about it I do not know, but it
is sad, let me tell you that.
I want to talk about transportation for a
moment or two, and I will go back for a few
years. I remember that many years ago a
tunnel was being advocated to connect the
Island with New Brunswick. In those days
the member for Prince County in the House
of Commons was a man by the name of
Howlan. My island colleague across the
chamber probably knows more about this
than I do. As I say, Mr. Howlan was advocating a tunnel. That was in the days of the
late Sir John A. Macdonald. Anyhow, he must
have been getting to be quite a nuisance on

JUNE 4, 1958
the subject and Sir John said, "You go down
there and run an election in your own county
and if you win we will probably look into
the matter". Howlan took him up on it, went
back home and ran a by-election, but was
licked. Well, honourable senators, there was
not very much more said about that tunnel.
However, along about 1904 we heard of
another very clever and ingenious politician,
the late Alexander Martin. My Island colleagues know of him, I am sure. Well, he
went for a tunnel right and left during the
four years he was in the House of Commons.
He even went to New York and investigated
the tunnel under the East River there. At
that time it was estimated that the tunnel
could have been built for about $10 million.
Well, heavens above! $10 million was big
money in those days, although now it is only
looked upon as a comparatively small sum.
Anyhow, that tunnel also was lost sight of.
Then came the car ferry and that was a
wonderful moment. We have had three new
car ferries since. There are two of them
now in operation.
But still we are not
satisfied. And that is the subject that I want
to labour, if honourable senators will bear
with me for a few moments.
Our transportation is a sort of bottleneck
at times in this respect, and that is unfortunate, because the tourist industry all over
the dominion is looked upon now as big
business.
On the Island, as we have the
facilities-that is, the climate, and this and
that and everything necessary-we regard
the tourist business as quite a source of income for the province.
But the service
given by our car ferries is not good enough,
and there lies the trouble. For instance, if
a wealthy New Yorker pulls up in his car
at Tormentine and finds the boat has gone
and he has to wait an hour or two until
she comes back again, he becomes disgusted.
He might wait and go across to the Island
and run into the same difficulty when ready
to make the return trip; and, if so, when he
gets across to the mainland he says, "To hell
with that"-excuse the phraseology-"that is
not good enough."
So now we are advocating a causeway and,
as you honourable senators know, you voted
for a grant for a real honest-to-goodness
engineer's survey as to cost, drawings, specifications and everything else. We hope that
when that report is made it will be favourable, and I trust also that this honourable
Senate will be sympathetic to our cause.
Now, honourable senators, I do not propose
to bore you one moment longer. As you
know, when a person stands up and shells off
his first utterances there is a certain amount
of tension, fear and so forth, so I think I will
just leave it at that.
57075-4-9

Hon. A. B. Baird: Honourable senators,
many of you who are here today may
remember the late Senator David. He once
stated in this chamber: "The brain is a
wonderful thing: it starts to function the
moment you are born and does not stop until
you get on your feet to make a speech."
Well, I think that just about fits me.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: You are too modest.
Hon. Mr. Baird: I join with those who
have already complimented His Honour the
Speaker and the new members, and perhaps
more especially the new Leader of the
Government (Hon. Mr. Aseltine) and the
recent Leader (Hon. Mr. Haig), who are
personal friends of mine.
Honourable senators, civilization could be
a wonderful thing; it is too bad indeed that
we never get a chance to try it.
On the hustings we have become accustomed to hear a lot about our wonderful
Canadian heritage, the priceless gift of our
forefathers. One of the traits we inherited
from them was the good old habit of living
within our means, of paying our own way
and paying it as we go, and, if we could not
afford a thing, to do without it. I have always
worried quite a bit about the way we have
been losing this ancient virtue and about the
growth of the habit of trying to keep up with
the Joneses-an idea that seems to have
developed the vicious habit of buying whatever the fancy of the moment would indicate
and putting off paying for it as long as
possible.
But now, to the surprise, I am sure, of the
members of this honourable Senate, our
Government is deliberately and with intention proposing to budget for a deficit.
Surprised? Nay, I should say shocked.
Parliament knows full well that deficit
budgeting has never been the Canadian way,
and to take such unprecedented action, merely
because of the very minority of the Opposition, verges closely upon a veritable dictatorship-something none of us would like to see
in Canada. Of course, it is easy to see that
the Government has placed itself in a very
precarious position as a result of its
egotistical and extravagant
pre-election
promises to cut taxes, to relieve unemployment, to beat inflation, and so on ad infinitum.
Taxes represent the means of paying our
governmental expenses, which must be paid
by us or by our children and grandchildren,
or even by their children. Putting off paying
our debts is a sure way of building up future
grief. There is only one way to cut taxes,
and that is to cut the cost of government.
Now, honourable senators, I want you to
look closely at the publicized proposals of
the Government, as indicated in the Speech

sincere attempt to cut the cost of government? What stands out in my mind is the
raising of all paternal pensions, no matter in
what field-raising, raising, raising, without
regard for who's going to pay, nor how, nor
when!
It seems that for a time we are to be
ruled on the basis of political expediency
promises,
pre-election
extravagant
and
building a great day of reckoning for a
Government probably for the Government
which is due to follow the present one.
There is real danger indicated in the
Financial Post headline of the past week:
"Unemployment Fund gets new $20 million
slap." The Government has again stepped in
and upset the security planned and built
into the Unemployment Insurance set-up on
an actuarial basis. The Government has a
number of similar set-ups where particular
projects are run on an incorporated basis, and
I look for danger ahead if the Government
continues to over-step management in the
operation of these phases of our national
business.
It is very easy for a new management in
any industry or enterprise to cause grievous
damage by hearkening to the pressure within
or without the organization, and so it is with
the business of government in these days of
organized pressure groups. I note with regret
the tendency already indicated by our Government to defer and promise regardlessly
to these pressure groups-particularly to
labour unions-which, heedless of the recession being experienced in business generally,
are still seeking increases in wages and in
benefits.
Higher costs in industry have succeeded
in pricing our products almost out of the export market and have reduced our national
purchases to a large degree. Organized labour
should beware of forcing prices still higher,
where still few buyers will be available.
Higher costs apply to most Government
activities. Planned spending for social welfare is due to raise another $94 million to a
total of over $880 million. Civil Service
salaries are upped $31 million to $701 million.
Public Works estimates are upped $27 million
to $218 million, to say nothing whatever of
the added cost of the South Saskatchewan
River dam, the railway to Great Slave Lake
and other unnamed projects well hinted by
the Government, but not yet publicly
declared.
Al this cannot be financed by deficits. Some
day, somebody, somehow, must pay.
If only the people of Canada could realize
how their pockets are being picked by inflation, I am sure there would be a march on
Ottawa.
Are we beating inflation? No! Building it.

Hon. William M. Wall: Honourable senators, before proceeding with the few observations I wish to make in the general context
of this debate on the Speech from the Throne
I would like to add my felicitations and best
wishes to the Honourable the Speaker on his
reappointment to this position of impartial
trust and high responsibitity, and to the
honourable the Government Leader in the
Senate (Hon. Mr. Aseltine), whose appointment has been so warmly received by all
members of this chamber; and to congratulate
the Honourable Senator Brunt on his appointment as Deputy Leader of the Government;
and to express to the Honourable John T.
Haig, P.C., the sincere sentiments of our
mutual respect and our joint tribute for the
contributions which he has made in this
honourable chamber. We hope for the senior
senator from Winnipeg many more years of
health so that we may continue to benefit
from his experience in public aff airs.
Four new colleagues have joined our ranks,
each bringing to the Senate his contributory
gifts of wisdom, talent and representative
experience, each adding to the sum total of
the representative nature of the personnel of
this chamber so that together we may be able
to perform with greater effectiveness the
legislative and other responsibilities for which
this chamber was instituted. This is the first
public opportunity I have had to bid them
welcome and I do so most warmly and
sincerely.
I regret that it was not my good fortune
to be present to hear the speeches of the
mover (Hon. Mr. Monette) and the seconder
(Hon. Mr. Thorvaldson) of the Address in
Reply to the Speech from the Throne, but
I have read them with diligent attention and
I was deeply impressed by the substantive
arguments which they presented.
(Translation):
May I congratulate them on their truly
remarkable speeches. I wish I had sufficiently
mastered the beautiful French language to
express with fitting fluency my feelings of
admiration and appreciation for the honourable senator from Mille Isles (Hon. Mr.
Monette) and the honourable senator from
Winnipeg-South (Hon. Mr. Thorvaldson).
(Text):
I confess that I was intrigued by this
final statement in the speech of the Leader
of the Government:
All in all, the Government program outlined in
the Speech from the Throne may well be the most
exciting and constructive in Canada's history.

It may, in fact, seem to be so; but "seem"
is not "is", and time will provide us with
more effective judgmental yardsticks. For

JUNE 4, 1958
surely this challenging and partly-provocative assertion must, I submit, be examined
in the historical perspective of the long list
of accomplishments of the former Liberal
administration which were also motivated
by a desire to further a practical realization
of Canadian unity, and liberty, and social
security, and Canadianism, and national
development-even that dealing specifically
with Canada's North. I venture to suggest
that this historical perspective will bring the
present legislative progran into sequential
and proper focus vis-à-vis the many exciting
and constructive programs which formed the
legislative framework for the continued
national development of Canada during the
preceding two decades.
It is not my intention to comment upon
the many interesting aspects of the governmental policies which have been outlined
in the Speech from the Throne. Many of
these are couched in traditional and general
terms, bespeaking from us a wait-and-see
attitude until the projected legislation can
be judged on its specifics. It is interesting
to note that some of these proposed legislative developments are natural and sequential extensions or modifications of public
policies initiated or planned by the former
administration, while a number of measures
and appropriations are to be proposed to
continue and to extend the Government's
program to sustain employment by the acceleration of a variety of public works and
other social capital projects. About these
there may arise some difference of opinion
concerning their timing and the degree of
their usefulness in halting a recession without aggravating the dangers and inequities
of presently accelerating inflationary trends.
All these projects, involving the ostensibly
more massive intervention of the state as
a corrective for some of our present economic
difficulties, also involve very considerable
capital outlays, to be financed through a
great deal of credit financing, and the Government thinks that the climate of the
capital market is such that these needed
funds will be forthcoming. Incidentally, and
significantly, I must add, the Government
does not exclude the possibility of an aggravation of inflationary trends under the
influence of such a heavy mobilization of
capital investment, and it warns us about
the dangers and inequities of inflation. And
well it might, honourable senators, as competent economists contend that there is a
causal relationship between inflation and
public deficit financing on the relatively high
scale which is estimated in the public expenditures as we can now see them.
How are we to solve at one and the saine
time the contradictory dilemma of maintaining
570754--91

full employment in a period of economic recession, without aggravating continuing inflationary trends? This is a national problem
of crucial importance which demands urgent
study; and we are indebted to the Leader
of the Opposition (Hon. Mr. Macdonald) and
to the honourable senator from Mille Isles
(Hon. Mr. Monette) for calling attention to
this problem, and to the honourable senator
from Shelburne (Hon. Mr. Robertson) for his
responsible and constructive analysis of this
grave peril-not only to the orderly development of our national economy but to the
strengthening of our democratic way of life.
I am not an economist, and only a sense
of urgent concern prompts me to make further
observations regarding this controversial and
highly-complicated problem of continuing inflationary pressures. It should be noted that,
paradoxically, we face the dilemma of being
forced to deal at one and the same time with
inflation and with recession, which last, according to the classical theory of economics, should bring lower costs and lower
consumer prices.
As has already been
mentioned during this debate, the consumer
price index has shown the largest annual
increase since 1951, increasing from 120.9 in
April, 1957, to 125.2 in April, 1958, an increase
of approximately 4 per cent in one year.
The overall extent of the continuing inflationary trends may be seen by examining
what, to me, are alarming figures, to be
found, for example, in Table I of the 1957
supplement of the Canadian Statistical Review
of the Dominion Bureau of Statistics.
The general wholesale price index of 1939
is listed at 99.2; in 1956 the wholesale price
index is 225.6. The consumer price index in
1939 was 63.2; in 1956, 118.1; on March 1,
1958, 124.3; in April, 125.2.
Another way of indicating the extent of
this problem is to link arithmetically the
present consumer price index, which is based
upon 1949 = 100, to the consumer price index,
1935-39 = 100, and then to measure the
purchasing power of a dollar based on 1939
100. What do we find? Translated to
this 1939 base, the average 1957 consumer
price index was 196.0, and the average
purchasing power of the Canadian dollar was
51.8 cents, measured by the consumer price
index, and 43.6 cents when measured by the
wholesale price index.
Using the consumer price index as a measure of the price change in disposable income,
a married man with two dependents, and
not qualified for family allowances, with a
disposable income of $2,500 in 1939 would
have to earn $5,225 now to have a disposable
income of $4,830, which last figure would
equal the purchasing power of $2,500 in 1939.
A single man, with heavier income taxes,

SENATE
would have to earn $5,670 in 1957 in order
to equal a disposable income of $2,500 in
1939.
Then, we should relate all this to the effects
of inflation upon Canadians with more static
incomes, dependent upon bond holdings, pensions or annuity fund payments or social
welfare-type payments, etc. Perhaps only
then can we appreciate the full impact of this
categorical statement in the 1956 report of
the Bank of Canada:
Inflation forcibly restricts consumption by exacting the greatest sacrifice from those least able to
bear it.

On page 428, the
this statement:

Gordon Report makes

The people who get hit the hardest in a period
of rising prices are pensioners, people who have
retired, and others with fixed incomes, the seare
called white collar class whose salaries
relatively inflexible, and particularly those who
are not organized in union groups.

These creditors, by and large, are the losers.
They pay for a relatively larger proportion
of the costs of inflation because they are least
able to insulate themselves from its effects,
and tragically, they are much too often the
least able to bear these costs.
And who are the beneficiaries? Are they
the debtors-all levels of government, and
very many of our business and industrial
corporations-and the great and organized
groups of many kinds and characters who
have acquired enough power to insulate themselves from the effect of certain economic
forces which are harmful to them, and
thereby to shift a relatively larger proportion
of inflationary costs upon the creditors, upon
those who have or are making savings in
liquid assets, in equity in insurance companies, in retirement or annuity funds?
Pursuing this problem further, in the context of the Government's somewhat pious
appeal for self-restraint and the somewhat
academic warning about the dangers and inequities of inflation, we might ask ourselves
whether the measures and instruments used
by governments to influence the rate of economic activity and maintain full employment
are inflation-biased, setting up contradictory
pressures which aggravate inflation by pushing up price levels. The Gordon Commission
seems to think that is so.
Furthermore, because there is greater sensitiveness and many more pressures for fostering employment during periods of economic
slowdown than for stopping inflation during
periods of economic exuberance, do our monetary and fiscal policies tend to do less
about curbing inflation and economic overTheoretically, we might fight

as a whole, to restrict or allocate credit, to
do effective cyclical budgeting, to decrease

appear not to be able to agree on the timing
or degree of badly needed counter-inflationary measures.
Certainly, honourable senators, what is
needed is a national declaration of purpose
concerning our determination either to halt
the rising tide of higher prices or to distribute their costs more effectively, just as we
made what in effect was a national declaration of purpose concerning employment and
the national sharing of costs of unemployment back in 1945. Certainly what is needed
is more public discussion, more parliamentary study and debate of this inflationary
problen, so that its dangers and inequities
may be brought to the same high level of
public consciousness as are those of recessions and unemployment.

awareness of the limitation vis-à-vis inflation control of our monetary policies, for
the regulation of a nation's money supply is

about which we have heard so much, for,

Bank of Canada is to regulate currency

monetary policies are not, in fact, blunt and

instruments,
whose effects are apparently unequally and
inequitably distributed among the four regions-we have not a single Canada-but
rather four economic regions-and among
the varous sectors of our Canadian econony.
Certainly what is needed is faith in the
continuing value of our currency, so that
the average Canadian may continue and perhaps increase the present relatively high rate
of savings to meet the prospective needs
of an orderly development of our Canadian
economy.
Certainly, too, Canadians will support
whatever monetary, fiscal or other public
measures are needed, if they understand the
basic issues involved, and if they know that

JUNE 4, 1958
their economic security is protected by sound
unemployment and other social welfare plans
and by the determination of their governments to combat recessions promptly.
Now, who is to give national leadership
to this crusade against inflation? I regard
this problem of inflation to be of such overriding and cardinal importance that I venture to suggest the need of either a special
debate on this subject by honourable senators
or the setting up of a special Senate committee to study inflation, a suggestion already
advanced by the honourable Leader of the
Opposition (Hon. Mr. Macdonald). I would
go farther and suggest to the Government
the desirability of a special joint committee
of both Houses of Parliament on inflation.
Honourable senators, the Speech from the
Throne mentions improvements made by the
last Parliament in federal-provincial financial
relations, which improvements are stated as
having had:
-a
beneficial effect upon our economy by
making it possible for provincial Governments and
their municipalities to proceed with greater confidence upon expanded programs of necessary
services and works.

These improvements undoubtedly refer to
the unilateral and, may one call it, the temporary increase of the provincial share of
personal income tax revenues from 10 to 13
per cent.
I am one who believes that the tax distribution formula involved in the basic agreements evolved in 1956 by the former Liberal
Governments needs continuing study and revisions to meet new and changing circumstances, after joint consideration by federal
and provincial authorities; and I believe that
the 3 per cent increase by the last Parliament was a desirable improvement in view of
the changed circumstances existing at that
time. However, I do not believe that further
changes will not be demanded or that they
are not necessary. May I be permitted to
guess that another federal-provincial conference in 1958 is a distinct possibility?
Furthermore, I believe that the basic general formula for these fiscal arrangements,
evolved after the Dominion Provincial Conference of 1956 is sound, not only because it
permits an option to provinces to use a certain adjudicated measure of their direct taxation rights themselves-or to rent them to
the federal Government, thus avoiding double
taxation problems-but because inherent in
this general formula are the two key principles of equalization and stabilization. The
Liberal Party believes that the time has now
come when the mnre specific definition-and
I am going to keep repeating the word
"definition" often-of equalization should
result in equalization payments up to the

per capitatax return level of the most wealthy
province. I am aware of press reports of
statements by Government spokesmen that
equal treatment would be accorded to al
provinces, but the definitive application of the
specific formula of equality could in fact
bring relative inequality and sequential
relative discrimination to the less prosperous,
less highly industrialized provinces. I regard
it as crucially important that the Government
recognize the importance of making certain
that the definition and specific application of
the equalization principle not only bring no
dilution or diminution of the present level of
redistribution through equalization, but that
it should revise it upward to the tax revenue
yield of the three standard taxes-personal,
corporation, succession duty-of the most
prosperous of our provinces, at present the
province of Ontario.
Before leaving this particular problem, it
may be of interest to honourable senators to
indicate that according to the one year only
13-9-50 formula which resulted from the
present Government's legislation of the last
session, the estimated Province of Manitoba
yield of approximately $20.4 million from the
three direct taxes, when divided by 860,000
people, gives a per capita yield of $23.78.
Note how this compares to an estimated yield
of the three standard taxes in Ontario of
approximately $42.39 per capita. Present
agreements, to bring special equalization payments up to approximately $41.50-the average of the two wealthiest provinces, the basis
of the 1956 agreements- would bring Manitoba's equalization payments to approximately
$15 million; and according to the new Liberal
formula-equal to the yield of the wealthiest
province-to $16 million. Note, please, the
importance of the definition of equalization.
Equalization to the average of four wealthiest
provinces-and there has been a lot of talk
about that particular definition-would decrease this payment to Manitoba to $10.8
million; and equalization to a national average
would reduce this by an additional $3 million,
that is, to approximately $7.5 million. So that
to the people of Manitoba the definition of
equalization means the difference that is
anywhere from $7 million to more or less
whatever the definition may be. Similar calculations could be made to show that the
specific definition of equalization would have
discriminatory effects upon equalization payments to Saskatchewan, Alberta, Newfoundland, Prince Edward Island, Nova Scotia, New
Brunswick and Quebec.
I am going to skip by the problem of
stabilization, which involves a guarantee of
a 95 per cent floor-and honourable senators
know how important that is in a period of
decreasing revenues during an economic

SENATE

recession-and I would like to add just this,
that it seemed important, honourable senators, to discuss this problem of federalprovincial fiscal relations in the context of
the very definite need for a specific definition
by the Government of the principles of
equalization and stabilization. This specific
definition the Government of Manitoba has
apparently not been able to obtain. Why?
Honourable senators, I am unable to resist
the temptation of trespassing upon your
valuable time by saying something about
the national development of our human
resources. As I consider the various proposals concerning the Government's intentions which are directed to the accelerated
and supposedly more vision-oriented plan of
national development, it does appear that
the majority of these projects have to do
with what one may term the more material
and more physical aspects of this development-a railroad, airports, airways, roads,
bridges, harbours, houses and the like. Now,
it may be that these more physical developmental projects rate an immediate and overriding priority, to which basic contention
unfortunately I cannot wholly subscribe.
For what is missing in the Speech from the
Throne is some definite indication of what
more the Government plans to do at the
national level-and without infringing upon
the constitutional responsibilities and competencies of the provinces-in the field of
concerted, national-level action, for the
national development of our human resources,
and, specifically, for the training and educating of our Canadian youth so that they may
more effectively participate in the new vision
of Canada's increased economic development and industrialization.
May I quote the words of the honourable
senator from Mille Isles (Hon. Mr. Monette):

Perhaps it would not be unfair to ask
ourselves these questions concerning projected national level spending for 1958-59:
(1) What are the increases in the main
estimates and the first of the supplementary
estimates laid before Parliament?
(2) What are the probable increases in the
sum total of projected expenditures, with
supplementary estimates still to come and
including capital or other expenditures involved in the legislation which is to be
presented to Parliament?
(3) What is the probable sum total of
anticipated deficit financing?
(4) How much more will be included in
these startingly large increases for national
interest and responsibility for education?

and 301,

gave us returns of federal Government expenditures to March 31, 1957, that is, for one
year, of approximately $421 million for gencral educational purposes.
Unfortunately it is not possible to get the
figures for the year ending March 31, 1958,
so I went into the estimates and I found that
there are changes in the levels of some of
these expenditures over and above the normal

changes we would expect from the growth of

our population and the normal extension of
services. There are changes in the estimates
for Indian education, for vocational and
technical schools, for research grants by the
National Research Council and for National
Research Council scholarships.
Some of these changes are significant and
will be welcomed, and the Government is to
be commended for these extensions. However,

The increases in numbers we anticipate are at
a rate which will double enrolments and graduations in twelve years, and yet there is every reason

JUNE 4, 1958
to believe that the economy will prove capable
of absorbing the increased numbers without
difficulty.

At page 450:
What is being suggested in essence is that a
deliberate effort be made to raise the quality and
standards of Canadian universities to among the
highest prevailing anywhere in the world.

And at page 451:
Fees at the present or at higher levels must
be supported by a combination of scholarships,
bursaries and loan funds, and, to meet the needs
of increasing numbers of students, funds for
student assistance must be steadily augmented.
I should like to pause on this last statement to re-emphasize the contention that I
have previously made in this chamber that
we are urgently in need of further national
assistance to safeguard for higher education
and training very large numbers of intellectually capable and willing and hard-working
Canadian boys and girls who at present are
prevented from proceeding with studies at
institutions of higher learning, mainly because
of financial difficulties. This type of direct
student assistance involves the minimum of
constitutional competency difficulties, being
merely a sequential and needed extension of
the present involvement of the federal Government in scholarships through the Department of National Health and Welfare, the
National Research Council and the Canada
Council. Canada, honourable senators, does
lag behind both the United States and the
United Kingdom in the provision of scholarships to universities, and this national problem
requires bold and vigorous action by private
enterprise, and by Governments at the federal
and provincial levels.
Let me summarize for you these simple and
I believe pertinent facts which we must keep
in mind:
(1) Twenty years ago about 4 per cent of
our college-age group became students in the
universities. We have made great strides since
then, and in 1957-58 8.8 per cent of our
college-age group were enrolled in our colleges and universities. We anticipate that
this rate is going to increase some more,
and within the next ten years it may be 14 or
15 per cent, as the present trend indicates.
But this compares with over 30 per cent in
the United States. Accordingly, in proportion
to our respective populations, the United
States graduates 2.5 times as many from
universities as we do in Canada. In 1955-56,
311,295 students received degrees in the United
States. Approximately 15,000 received degrees
in Canada in 1957.
(2) We need to increase the infiow of
students into universities, colleges and technical institutions. This need has been well
documented by many validated studies. A
committee of the National Conference of

Canadian Universities estimated in 1955 that
the accumulated shortage of university
graduates would reach 190,000 within ten
years, other things being equal.
(3) We estimate that 50 per cent of our
intellectually capable and hard-working high
school graduates do not go on to higher institutions of learning because of financial
problems. We estimate that one out of every
three very gifted students-students with
I.Q.'s of 130 plus-does not go on to higher
education.
(4) The United Kingdom now aids threequarters of all students entering university.
Australia provides national aid for one-half
of all her university students. The United
States provides financial aid to approximately
75 per cent of its university and college students, and just lately the National Education
Association in the United States has asked
the United States Government to set up a
$200 million-a-year national scholarship program to help to bring in an additional 200,000
talented students who drop out and do not
go on to college.
Now, what is the situation in Canada?
Canada's total scholarships, bursaries and
loans amount to around $10 million a year,
roughly one-half of this sum for undergraduates, giving one scholarship to every
four undergraduates. The scholarships average only $325 a year. Some 61 per cent of
our graduate students received aid. The
grand total for Canada is 18,000 students
aided by scholarships from $25 up to $1,000
or more. You have to compare that with our
1957-58 enrolment, which was around 85,000.
(5) The next point in this series of facts:
it is estimated by a survey of the Dominion
Bureau of Statistics that last year it cost
on the average-and that may be more or
less-$1,215 for a student to attend university.
Most universities are raising fees: McGill is
raising its fees by 25 per cent; the University
of Manitoba by 10 per cent. So the cost is
going to go up. If the cost goes up and
approaches $1,300, and if we assume that
a student may by summer employment earn
$500, he has to find another $800 to go to
college. For a family to provide $800 or more
for a student to go to college requires a
certain level of income. How much annual
income do we think a family should have in
order to be able to give a boy or girl $800,
$900 or $1,000 a year while he or she is
attending university? A rough estimate by one
of these studies indicated a family income of
at least $5,000 a year would be necessary.
While we do not quarrel with that figure, let
us consider what the statistics show with
respect to the number of Canadian families
having an income of $5,000, or more. A

SENATE
study carried out by the Dominion Bureau
of Statistics in 1955 on non-farm family
and individual incomes showed that 77.9 per
cent of Canadian families and individuals
ostensibly earn less than $5,000 a year.
In the light of this national need I must
call attention to the fact that the Leader of
the present Opposition in the House of Commons pledged his party to establish, in consultation with the provinces and the National
Conference of Universities, a national scheme
of 2,500 Canada scholarships and 7,500 Canada bursaries valued respectively at $1,000
and $500 annually. Because these scholarships and bursaries would be tenable for
four years, the final total number of scholarships and bursaries would involve some
40,000 students. Our present university enrolment is 85,000, and it is growing more
rapidly than we expected. We are now helping some 18,000 students. So, if we help
another 40,000, by the time the scheme gets
into operation, we would be giving assistance
to approximately half our student enrolment.
It is estimated that the final cost of this
plan, after four years of operation and when
the total load has become established, would
be $25 million a year, and we could relate
this sum to the increased federal expenditures
An additional and
at present envisaged.
important part of this practical program
involves the National Student Loan Fund
from which university students would be able
to borrow interest-free money to continue
their education, with re-payment at 4 per
cent interest to commence one year after
graduation.
I commend this particular program to the
attention of the Government of the day.
I notice that the Honourable Mr. Pearson
is asking the House of Commons to consider
a resolution which would bring into legislative being this national human resources development project of scholarships, bursaries
and loans. I, for one, shall watch with great
interest the acid test involved in the substantive and tactical treatment which will be
accorded to this resolution by the present
Government.
Honourable senators, I apologize for taking
so much of your time, and I am grateful for
the close attention you have given me.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Roebuck, debate
adjourned.

BUSINESS OF THE SENATE
Hon. Mr. Aselline: Honourable senators, I
had expected that a Supply Bill would reach
us from the other place for first reading here
today, but I have just now received a note
saying that sufficient progress has not been
made for that to happen. As it is unlikely
that the bill will reach us before tomorrow,
I have no alternative but to move, seconded
by honourable Senator Quinn, that the Senate
do now adjourn.

APPROPRIATION BILL No. 3, 1958
FIRST READING
The Hon. the Speaker informed the Senate
that a message had been received from the
House of Commons with Bill C-22, for
granting to Her Majesty certain sums of
money for the public service of the financial
year ending the 31st of March, 1959.
Bill read first time.
SECOND

READING

The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators,
when shall this bill be read the second time?
Hon. W. M. Aselline: With leave of the
Senate, I move the second reading now.
Honourable senators, before dealing with
Bill C-22 I should like to refer to section 4
of Appropriation Bill No. 2, the last supply
bill, with respect to which section the Honourable the Leader of the Opposition (Hon.
Mr. Macdonald) made certain inquiries as to
the necessity for it. I have before me a memorandum which is of considerable length.
Would the honourable gentleman be satisfied
if I filed the memorandum, or does he wish
me to deal with the matter now?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Some other honourable senators may be interested in an explanation of the clause and might like to hear
what the honourable leader has to say. For
my part, I would like to hear it.
Hon. Mr. Aseline: Then I will go ahead
with my explanation of that matter now.
I wish to refer honourable senators to section 30 (1) of the Financial Administration
Act, which reads:
No contract providing for the payment of any
money by Rer Majesty shall be entered into or
have any force or effect unless the Comptroller
certifies that there is a sufficient unencumbered
balance available out of an appropriation or out
of an item included in estimates before the House
of Commons to discharge any commitments under
such contract that would, under the provisions
thereof, come in course of payment during the
fiscal year in which the contract was entered into.

With that must be read subsection (5) of
section 31, which provides:
(5) Where the Comptroller
(a) declines to make a payment,

(b) disallows an item in an account, or
(c) refuses to give a certificate required by this
act,
the appropriate Minister of the department concerned may report the circumstances to the
Treasury Board for its decision, and the Board may
confirm or overrule the action of the Comptroller
and give such directions as are necessary to carry
out its decision.

These are the two sections which deal with

this matter. In the period April 1 to May 12,
1958 the many thousands of contracts which
had to be entered into to keep both construction and operating programs proceeding at
a normal rate were entered into without the
usual Comptroller's certificate under section
30(1), which I have just mentioned, but with
the approval of the Treasury Board as required in such circumstances under section
31(5). In addition, while it had not been possible to table the estimates, all the contracts
which were entered into during this period
fall within the terms and amounts of the
estimates which were later tabled on May 13.
The Financial Administration Act in its
present form does not specifically provide
for a situation wherein estimates cannot be
presented to Parliament before the first
day of April. While it was possible to
operate within the strict terms of the law
during this period, it was nevertheless considered desirable by the Government to
draw Parliament's attention to the unusual
course of action which had to be taken during this period. For this reason a special
section was included in the interim supply
bill which was considered by Parliament
three weeks ago.
That section reads as
follows:
4. Contracts entered into, after the 31st day of
March, 1958, but before the 13th day of May, 1958,

That is the period during which no estimates
had been brought before Parliamentfor any of the purposes specified in any of the
items set forth in those estimates are hereby ratified
and confirmed.

That, honourable senators, is my explanation for the insertion in the bill which we
passed some three weeks' ago of the clause
having to do with contracts made between
those dates.
In dealing now with Bill C-22, I would
like to refer honourable senators particularly
to sections 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8. The total
amount now asked for is $624,592,837.43,
made up as follows.
Section 2 of the bill provides for one-sixth
of all the items to be voted in the main
estimates for the fiscal year 1958-59 except
three votes which were authorized in the
supply bill I have just mentioned. I refer

JUNE 5, 1958
to Votes 439, 443 and 502 for which eleventwelfths had already been provided in the
previous interim supply bill. One-sixth of
all these items amounts to $601,131,574.17.
Section 3 of the bill provides for an
additional seven-twelfths of Votes 106 and
108, which appear in the schedule to the
bill. The total amount here provided is
$408,333.34.
Section 4 provides for one-sixth of Votes
144, 182, 185 and 186, the total amount being
$713,336.50.
Section 5 provides for an additional onetwelfth of Votes 10, 70, 111, 152, 197, 198,
199, 201, 203, 207, 211, 212, 291 and 303,
amounting to $2,849,749.75.
The additional amounts are in addition to
the one-sixth. As an example, I might say
with regard to Votes 106 and 108 in Schedule
A, that if this bill is passed we shall have
authority to use eleven-twelfths of the total
estimate for the purposes for which they are
granted. We authorized two-twelfths, that is,
one-sixth, in the last supply bill. The present
supply bill authorizes another one-sixth, or
two-twelfths, plus seven-twelfths. These total
eleven-twelfths. There remains one-twelfth
for consideration at a later date, if anyone
wishes to debate the matter.
Next I go to the supplementary estimates,
which were tabled three days ago, and
amount to some $85 million. Section 6 of the
bill provides one-sixth of all of the items to
be voted in the supplementary estimate for
the fiscal year 1958-59, the amount here being
$14,287,343.67.
Section 7 provides for an additional threequarters-that is, in addition to the one-sixth
-of votes 545, 546, 547 and 627. This amounts
to $5,002,500.
Section 8 provides for an additional onethird of vote 635, namely, $200,000.
The total of all these items is $624,592,837.43.
I would like to say further that the proportions requested in this bill are intended
to provide for all necessary requirements of
the public service during the months of June
and July. The earlier bill made provision for
money to pay for necessary requirements of
the public service for the months of April
and May. In no instance is the total amount
of any item being released by this bill.
Honourable senators, as I stated when I
introduced the previous supply bill, the passing of this bill will not prejudice the rights
and privileges of honourable senators to
criticize any item in the estimates when they
come up for consideration.
Hon. Mr. Reid: That is, if we have time to
do so.
Hon. Mr. Aseiline: The usual undertaking
is given that such rights and privileges of
57075-4-1OJ

members will be respected and will not be
curtailed or restricted in any way as a result
of the passing of this measure.
Honourable senators, subject to the answering of any questions that may be asked, that
is my explanation of this bill.
Hon. W. Ross Macdonald: Honourable
senators, in the first instance, I wish to thank
the Leader of the Government (Hon. Mr.
Aseltine) for giving us an explanation of the
reason for inserting clause 4 in the appropriation bill which was passed by this house on
May 15. It will be recalled that in that bill
there was a clause which I will say legalized
certain contracts that had been entered into
between the 31st of March and the 13th of
May of this year. That clause had not appeared in a prior appropriation bill since
1926, and a number of senators were concerned about the reason for it. Why were
we expressing our approval of these particular contracts when we had not expressed
approval of any other contracts?
The Leader of the Government has given
an explanation today. I have not seen the
document from which he read but I am glad
he did read it. I gather from what he said
that according to section 30, subsection (1), of
the Financial Administration Act the Government cannot enter into any contract for
which funds have not been provided or have
not been included in the estimates tabled.
The estimates were not tabled before the
13th of May because Parliament did not meet
until the 12th of May. I realize that the
business of the country had to go on between
the 31st of March and the 13th of May. Honourable senators will recall that the estimates
for the year 1957-58 had been tabled during
the life of the previous Parliament-they had
been tabled by the former administration, so
after the 31st of March the Government could
not, within the section of the act which the
honourable gentleman has read, enter into
contracts. But the Leader of the Government
read section 31(5), which gives the Treasury
Board certain powers. Well, the Treasury
Board exercised these powers and if it was
within their right to do so it was legally
competent for them to do so. Why then did
they have this clause inserted in the bill?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: It was not within
their right.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: My honourable friend
the Leader of the Government says it was,
but probably some law officers of the Government are of the same opinion as the
honourable senator from Toronto-Trinity
(Hon. Mr. Roebuck). I think they must have
questioned the procedure. Now the honourable Leader of the Government has said that
the clause was inserted in the bill to direct

SENATE
Parliament's attention to this unusual procedure. But if the procedure was legal and
merely unusual it was not necessary to put
the clause in the bill. Did it make it more
unusual to insert in the bill authorization
for something that has been done legally?
Did they want to make the procedure more
unusual than it even was?
The clause to which the honourable senator
referred was either good or not good. I do
not think we in this bouse should be asked
to confirm something that had been done
legally, confirm it by a statute, because once
the bill is passed it becomes a statute of
Parliament. It was a most unusual proceeding. I agree with the Leader of the Government that the payment in the first place
was unusual, and I think he will agree with
me that the procedure of inserting authorization for it in a bill and making it part of
a statute of Canada vas very unusual.
Now, honourable senators, I come to the
bill which is before us. Let me say first
that I am a little disappointed in it. It may
be recalled that I complimented the Government on the form of the previous supply
bill, which was passed here on May 15. In
that bill the Government presented the expenditures very concisely in one clause of
27 lines, and anyone looking at that one
clause got a clear idea of what the expenditures were. I complimented the Government
upon presenting such an excellent bill. But
what do I find today? Apparently the Government does not appreciate compliments
from the Leader of the Opposition in the
Senate. I suppose if I had not said anything
about it this bill would have come to us
in the very excellent form of the previous
bill. But the Government has reverted to
the habit of setting forth the payments in
separate clauses, so that the information given
by one clause in the previous bill is now
spread out in seven clauses which take up
a part of three nages of the bill before us.
Well, I again compliment the Government
upon what it did in the first instance.
Hon. Mr. Bruni:
Why not criticize if?
Then it might change back to the previous
form.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: As the honourable
senator says, if I criticize the Government it
might change back. But I am not quite as
inconsistent as that, and I do hope it will
revert to the previous form.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Would the Honourable
the Leader of the Opposition allow me to
interject? I completely overlooked the compliment which he expressed when speaking
on the previous bill, but after hearing him
today I will see to it at once that his remarks
are drawn to the attention of the minister.

I have an opinion along the same line as my
honourable friend's remarks and at least partially agree with them.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Don't they ever read the
Senate Hansard?
Hon. Mr. Bruni: They haven't the time.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Honourable senators,
this is a usual interim supply bill. Of course
a supply bill is far from a routine or formal
measure: it is one of the most important bills
that come before this bouse.
The present
bill seeks approval of the expenditure of a
very large sum of money, in the amount of
$624,592,837.43.
It is not the amount that I
am referring to at the present time, however,
but the responsibility we take in passing bills
of this kind.
If this bill were not passed
by Parliament the Government would have
no money to spend, notwithstanding section
31(5) of the Financial Administration Act on
which the Government relied between March
31 and May 13.
Therefore, we should not
pass this measure just as a mere formality.
Of course the Government must have money
to carry on the business of the country, and
we are not opposed to giving it money for
that purpose. But I would remind the Government that it recelves this money only
because Parliament votes it, and the Government cannot spend it as a matter of right.
In fact, in my ooinion, the only time when
the Government has a right to spend money
which has not been voted by Parliament is
under the unusual circumstances of a period
between dissolution and a general election,
when money may be obtained by Governor
General's warrants, and I do not think that
expediency should be taken advantage of
until it is absolutely necessary.
The Senate, as one of the houses of Parliament, is now being asked to give the Government money enough to carry on the business
of the country for the next two months. But
if honourable senators will note the title of
this bill they will see that it reads:
An Act for granting to Her Majesty certain sums
of money for the public service for the financial
year ending the 31st March, 1959.

Through this bill we are asked to grant to
Her Majesty the sum of more than $624 million, and if I read correctly the statements
which have appeared in the newspapers we
do not have this money-that is, unless the
Government borrows it. We are now proposing magnanimously to grant this huge
sum which can only be obtained through
loans. Why do I say that? I find that in
April last the Government did not have
enough money to carry on the business of
the country by $10,700,000, not including the

JUNE 5, 1958
deficit in the Old Age Pension account. So
we did flot colleet enough money to pay our
bis.
Honourable senators, this Governrnent
seems to be very much interested in establishing records. It established a wonderful
record when on election day it had elected
more members than any previaus administration, and recorded a greater number of
votes in each constîtuency, and got greater
mai orities. Now it is keeping on making
records with record expenditures and record
deficiencies. How far can this go?
Hon. Mr. Quinn: You are stili asking for
more.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald:
for more.

No, you are asking

Hon. Mr. Quinn: I mean your members in
the other place are asking for more.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: If my friend has
listened to the debates that have taken place
in this bouse he will know that we are very
much concerned about the excess of expenditures over receipts. Indeed, we would be
very much more interested in the Government setting a record in excess of receipts
over expenditures. I say we cannot continue
with these record deficits. For instance, the
Canadian National Raîlways has a deficit of
$29,600,000.
Hon. Mr. Euler: $55 million.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: The reported deficit
for the C.N.R. is $29,600,000, whîch is the
first deficit it has had in four years.
Hon. Mr. Croil: That was a week ago.
Since then it has reached $55 million.
Hon. Mr. Bruni: No, that is the estimate
for next year.
Hon. Macdonald: I amn reading from a
Canadian Press dispatch, a source which I
find reliable, which says that as of May 22
the deficit was $29,600,000. Apparently it has
now reached $55 million. That probably was
what it was yesterday-I don't know what it
is today. It seemed to me to be bad enough
on May 22.
Honourable senators, I am very serious
about this. How long can such deficits continue? How long shall we be content to go
along without paying our way? We do not
have a budget. A budget will be brought
down this session, but in the meantime we
do not know what the state of the financial
health of the country is. We only know that
it is flot good, and that it cannot remain
unhealthy forever. If one of us finds that his
health is flot good he can't just go on and

forget about it; he has to stop and do something to improve it. So it is with the
country.
Hon. Mr. Quinn: Would you say the
country to the south of us is any better off ?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I arn not comparing
Canada with the country to the south at the
moment.
Hon. Mr. Quinn: Or any other country in
the world.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I am only iudging
Canada. Let me remind my honourable
friend from Bedford-Hlalifax (Hon. Mr.
Quinn) that the former administration lef t
this country with the soundest and healthiest
economy of any country in the world. I
arn anxious that the present Governrnent
should see to it that our economny is not
weakened, but is maintained.
My remarks today are made flot so much
by way of criticism as by way of warning;
but if the present practice continues my
remarks will become very critical. I have
no hesitancy in telling the Government that
though these exependitures happen to be
popular-that is, popular for the momentthey are flot sound, and any policy which is
not sound cannot be popular for ever. An
accounting has to be made sooner or later.
I say this to my honourable friend from
Bedford-Halifax: my wish is that this Government will go out of office leaving the country
with as sound an economy as it had when
the Government came into office.
Hon. Mr. Reid: May I ask the Leader of
the Government a question? Why are there
two items, Nos. 111 and 545, both to provide
for the purchase of wheat and flour for
India, Pakistan and Ceylon, one for $10
million and the other for $3 million? Why
should there be two such items for the
same purpose?
Hon. Mr. Bruni: In what schedules do they
appear?
Hon. Mr. Reid: Vote 111 is in Schedule C,
on page 6, and Vote 545 in Schedule D,
on page 8.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: My information is that
Vote 111 for $10 million is to pay for the
delivery of wheat and flour from Canadian
supplies, and has not been completed.
Hon. Mr. Reid: Both are to relieve food
shortages. That is what drew my attention
to them.
Hon. Mr. A.seliine: If the honourable senator will read the estimates carefully he will

SENATE
see that Vote 545 is for a further amount
for the same purpose, to pay for deliveries
of wheat and flour by Canadian suppliers to
be completed shortly.

Hon. Mr. Power: For the expenditure which
is supposed to be completed you are asking
for one-twelfth; for the other one you are
asking for three-fourths.
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa WesI): Vote 111
is in the main estimates and Vote 545 is
Probably that is
in the supplementaries.
why the items are separated.
Hon. Mr. Power: But why do we ask for
three-fourths of the item which is in the
supplementaries, and which presumably as
yet we have not expended, and only onetwelfth of the item in the main estimates,
which presumably we have expended?
Hon. Mr. Crerar: The items we are discussing are No. 111, which amounts to $10
million, and Nos. 545 and 546, totalling
$4,500,000, making in all $14, million. I should
like to ask the honourable Leader of the
Government (Hon. Mr. Aseltine) if these
sums are in addition to the funds voted by
Parliament under the Colombo Plan, or does
the money come out of the grant under that
plan?
Hon. Mr. Aselline: My information is that
these have nothing at all to do with the
Colombo Plan.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: Then they are in addition to the Colombo Plan vote?
Hon. Mr. Aselline: I may be wrong, but
that is the way I look at it.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: That is understandable.
But we hear some talk these days of the
Government taking credit to itself for having
expanded the sale of wheat. Only the other
day I read a newspaper report, originating
with the Minister of Trade and Commerce,
that under the excellent administration of
the present Government wheat exports were
going up and our wheat surplus was going
down,-which rejoices the heart of everyone. But I think it is well to bear in mind
that at least the $15 million paid for these
exports comes from the pockets of Canadian
taxpayers, and probably I should not be very
far astray if I predicted that we shall have
some repetition in future of items of this
kind.

Hon. Mr. Aseltine: I would say to the honourable senator, in that connection, that in
the speech I made last Tuesday I referred
to our satisfactory position with regard to

exports, and that the figures I gave in that
relation did not include the cost of these
gifts of wheat.

Hon. Mr. Crerar: I was not referring to
the remarks made by the honourable Leader
of the Government; I was alluding to a statement conveyed to the public by the minister
through the newspapers.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: The honourable senator from Gulf (Hon. Mr. Power) referred
to certain items of expenditure for which
three-fourths are asked at this time, to provide for the purchase of wheat and flour to be
given to India, Pakistan and Ceylon, and of
four to be given to the United Nations Relief
and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees
in the Near East, as well as for a contribution to the 1958 Fellowship Fund of the International Atomic Energy Agency. I understand that three-fourths of these items will
be spent within the next two months, and
for that reason three-fourths are asked for
now. In respect of most of the items in the
estimates the payment is made in fairly equal
amounts spread over the whole year, from
month to month. For them, there are just
two-sixths required, but on account of the
fact that a large proportion of the expenditure on the special items I mentioned will be
made in the next two months, it is necessary
to have three-fourths included in this bill.
Hon. Mr. Reid: That does not answer the
question.
Hon. Mr. Power: The honourable Leader
of the Opposition is acting as Leader of the
Government. I would like to know whether
Items 111 and 545 refer to the same project,
that is the supply of food to relieve shartages
in India, Pakistan and Ceylon. That question was originally asked by the honourable
senator from New Westminster (Hon. Mr.
Reid).
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I will let the honourable Leader of the Government answer that
one.
Hon. Mr. Asel±ine: The answer to that
question was given, I understand, by the
honourable senator from Ottawa West (Hon.
Mr. Connolly).
Hon. Mr. Power: No; he said that one
item was in the main estimates and the
estimates,other in the supplementary
which is a very logical and reasonable conclusion for him to draw on the basis of the
very slight element of information which
has been given by the Government. I am
now asking if both items are for the same
project.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: I have some information for the honourable senator; I do not
know whether it will satisfy him or not.
Vote 545 is supplementary to Vote 111. That
is understood.

JUNE 5, 1958
Hon. Mr. Power: I learned that from the
honourable senator from Ottawa West. He
gave me that information.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: The total program of
assistance was $25 million, of which $15
million was made available in the year
1957-58; the remaining $10 million was to be
included in the main estimates of 1958-59.
Later, when it became apparent that only
$12 million of the $15 million which had
been allocated had been spent in the fiscal
year 1957-58, the $3 million which lapsed in
1957-58 was reinserted in the supplementary
estimates for 1958-59.

Hon. Mr. Aselline: That is correct. There
was no market for the oats and the board
had to pay storage, and they eventually
had to take a loss on them.

Hon. Mr. Power: May I ask the honourable
Leader of the Government another question?
In the very lucid explanation which he gave
with respect to the insertion of clause 4 in
the previous appropriation bill, he stated
that it was within the authority of the Treasury Board to overrule, under section 31 of the
Financial Administration Act, the Comptroller
of the Treasury in case he refused to give
a certificate that the funds were available,
Hon. Mr. Euler: It is $10 million plus $3 or words to that effect. Now, may I ask if
in fact the Comptroller of the Treasury did

refuse to give a certificate and, if so, in

Hon. Mr. Bruni: That is right.

to be made.

SENATE
Hon. Mr. Power: My inquiry is simply
directed to ascertain what steps were taken
by the Comptroller of the Treasury under
these peculiar circumstances. We are entitled
to know what constitutional procedure was
followed. It was something which had not
happened before, to the best of my historical
knowledge-perhaps that is not very greatfor over 300 years. It has been 300 years
since the Crown has been able to appropriate
moneys of the people of Canada or of any
British country without having to appeal to
the people and without having such moneys
voted by Parliament. So if there is a new
procedure, we want to know what it is. The
last man who did this lost his head.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: I think the same procedure was followed in 1926.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: The Honourable the
Leader of the Government says the same
procedure was followed in 1926?
Hon. Mr. Aselline: That was my information.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Why was it followed
in 1926? We can't go back to 1926, but the
honourable gentleman from Gulf (Hon. Mr.
Power) has asked a question with respect
to this unusual procedure, and I think we
are entitled to an answer. I can understand
that the Leader of the Government may not
have the information today. I do not want
to hold up this bill now, but I feel that before
the next appropriation bill cornes down the
Leader of the Government should obtain this
information. It took a month for us to get
information respecting clause 4 which was
inserted in the last appropriation bill, and
I think the house is entitled to the information now requested by the honourable gentleman from Gulf. As far as I am concerned,
I certainly reserve the right to bring forth
this matter again when the next appropriation
bill is before us, and at that time I will expect
an answer.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: I am sorry that I cannot
give any further information at the present
time, and I will do my best to satisfy honourable members opposite as soon as possible.
Hon. Mr. McDonald: I wonder if the Honourable the Leader of the Government could
give us a statement now as to the financial
standing of the country at the end of the
fiscal year 1957-58. It would seem that before
we pass these or any other estimates we
should have a knowledge of what the financial
standing of the country was at the end of the
last fiscal year. I certainly think all honourable senators would welcome that information.

Hon. Mr. Asel±ine: It is impossible to give it
now. It will be disclosed when the budget is
brought down.
Hon. Mr. McDonald: Could the Honourable the Leader of the Government tell us
when that will be?
Hon. Mr. Aseliine: I would like to say to
my honourable friend that if I knew I would
be very glad to give him the information,
but I do not happen to know.

OF
INQUIRY STANDS

On the notice by Hon. Mr. Robertson:
That he will inquire of the Government:(1) What was the amount paid to the Province
of Nova Scotia for the fiscal year ending March
31, 1958 of a share of income tax collected from
corporations whose main business is the distribution to, or generation for distribution to the
public of electrical energy, gas or steam (Chap.

(2) What year's income tax collections was used
as the basis for determining the amount of the

(3) How was the amount of the above payment
determined?
(4) What were the names of the corporations
from which the above income tax was collected?
(5) As a consideration of the payment to the

corporations concerned in order to reduce their
charges to their customers?

Hon. Mr. Aselline: Honourable senators,
with regard to this inquiry by the honourable

MERCANTILE AND
GENERAL REINSURANCE
COMPANY OF CANADA LIMITEDTHIRD READING

Hon. William R. Bruni moved the third
reading of Bill S-3, respecting The Mercantile
and General Reinsurance Company of Canada
Limited.
Hon. Wishari McL. Robertson: Honourable
senators, I have no opposition whatever to
this bill, but an observation made by its
sponsor (Hon. Mr. Brunt) on second reading
escaped my attention until I read it in
Hansard, and I should like to refer briefly
to it.
Honourable senators will recall that the
bill, which is a very simple one and was very
clearly explained by the honourable senator,
seeks to increase the capital of the company
from $1 million to $5 million, so that it will
have additional capital available to cover
losses and business expansion. A relatively
small number of shares is held by the directors under the provisions of the Canadian
and British Insurance Companies Act, and
the ownership of the remaining issued shares
is entirely in the hands of the parent company, the Mercantile and General Reinsurance Company of England. And the closing
paragraph of the explanation given by my
honourable friend served very definite notice
about the intention in respect to future investment in this company. He said, as reported on page 111 of Hansard:
According to the present intention of both the
parent company and the Canadian subsidiary
company, none of the additional capital stock will
be offered for sale to the general public. It is the
intention that the parent company in England will
take up any additional stock that is offered from
time to time.

In the light of some criticism which has

quarters with respect to the policy of external
capital in Canada, involving the total ownership by parent companies abroad of Canadian
subsidiary companies, and the failure to give
to Canadians an opportunity to invest in these
subsidiaries, would my honourable friend like
to make any comment on that phase in respect to the bill which he has sponsored?
Hon. Mr. Bruni: Honourable senators, there
is no comment I can make. I simply stated
a fact that was given to me by the sponsors
of the bill, who said that that was their
present intention. They may change their
policy in the future, but there is nothing that
I can do to bring about a change. The company determines its own policy, and its
present policy is that the parent company in
England will take up the shares of the Canadian company as offered.

SPEECH FROM THE THRONE
MOTION FOR ADDRESS IN REPLYDEBATE CONTINUED
The Senate resumed from yesterday consideration of His Excellency the Governor
General's speech at the opening of the
session, and the motion of Honourable
Mr. Monette,
seconded by Honourable
Mr. Thorvaldson, for an Address in reply
thereto.
Hon. Arthur W. Roebuck: Honourable
senators, the order for resuming the debate
stands in my name, but I am going to ask
a slight indulgence. I understand that the
honourable senator from Blaine Lake (Hon.
Mr. Horner) has certain engagements which
make it convenient for him to address the
house at the present moment, and if I may
be permitted I would like to yield the floor to
my honourable friend, on the understanding
that I will adjourn the debate at the close
of his speech.
Hon. Senators: Agreed.

Hon. R. B. Horner: Honourable senators,
I know that honourable senators would be
disappointed if I did not have something to
say on the Address in reply to the Speech
from the Throne.
First of all, I wish to join other honourable
senators in congratulating Your Honour on
being reappointed as Speaker of this chamber.
I am sure we are all delighted.
I wish also to congratulate the mover and
the seconder of the Address. In fact I wish
to congratulate all those who have taken
part in the debate. I would mention particularly the honourable senator from Ottawa
East (Hon. Mr. Choquette), who I thought did
a remarkable job. I also wish to offer special
congratulations to the Leader of the Opposition (Hon. Mr. Macdonald), and to thank him
for the very kind remarks he made regarding
the election of my sons to the House of
Commons.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Well merited.
Hon. Mr. Horner: It is not going to be any
political speech that I am going to make on
this occassion. "My cup runneth over", as
everything that I could wish for along political
lines has been granted to me.
However, honourable senators, there are
a few remarks that I wish to make, not for
the benefit of any political party but for the
benefit of the people of Canada as a whole.
I wish to extend my sympathy to the honourable senator from St. John's (Hon. Mr. Baird).
Hon. Mr. Baird: It may be misplaced.
Hon. Mr. Horner: I can well sympathize
with some of the ideas that he expressed,
because we grew up in the school in which
a person saved money to become wealthy, but
today that principle is just as out of date
as the ox is in comparison with the automobile. The idea prevailing today is that
we must spend and spend and spend to get
rich. Going along with that idea, the honourable senator might follow a suggestion of
mine that he pick up a Rolls Royce car and
take me and some other gentlemen on a tour
of Canada, including the Peace River country,
and everywhere we went we would spend and
spend, and everybody would be enriched.
Henry Ford was the first man to come along
with some new ideas about spending, and I
remember a lot of people were amazed at
them. Up until his day fathers taught their
sons to save, they got them a little bank, and
later opened a bank account for them and
encouraged them to save and hold on to their
money. But Henry Ford said he did not want
to teach his sons to save money, he wanted
them taught how to invest it wisely, and that
was a departure from the usual procedure.
Now, honourable senators, let us just stop
and think of the chaos that has taken place

JUNE
in many countries of the world resulting
largely from inflation and money conditions.
And then let us compare the conditions in
Canada, with its total wealth, its per capita
wealth, its rich resources, the numberless
opportunities to make a living, and considering
all these advantages we can only conclude
that we in Canada have nothing to fear. As
the late President Roosevelt said, "We have
nothing to fear but fear". However, the
greatest misfortune, the greatest calamity,
that can befall Canada is to bring about the
ruin of our young men and women by sowing
false ideas of economy in their minds. But,
as long as they are willing to work and our
homes are kept intact, we have nothing to
fear.
Some remarks were made this afternoon by
the Leader of the Opposition about a balanced
budget. But let me point out that during
part of the time he was talking about we had
a terrible war. Thank God, Canada was not
devastated in any way, but it was as a result
of that war and as an aftermath of it that
we had the prosperity that the Liberals
brought to Canada. I certainly would not
wish another such catastrophe for the people
of the world in order to make prosperity in
this country under the Conservatives and
leave a balanced budget.
I do not wish to make a political issue
out of it, but to keep the record straight,
and for the good of the people of the country
as I see it, let me say that during part of
time the Leader of the Opposition spoke
about we had as Prime Minister-I hesitate
to say this-a man whose thought was not
so much of Canada and Canadian familles
particularly, as that he was running a race
with one Walpole of England; he wanted to
extend his term of office as Prime Minister
beyond that of this English statesman.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: You got very good
administration during all his period of office.
Hon. Mr. Horner: You have that opinion,
but I haven't.
We hear some talk today about certain
differences or unpleasantries between Canada
and the United States. But these are just
in the minds of some of the press. After all,
we are one family. I have done some trading
myself, and I never liked to trade with a man
when I had to trade for him as well as for
myself. I liked to trade with a man who
could stand up and take his own part, and
when I did not have to consider whether I
was getting the better of him or not. I like
to see a man able to take care of himself.
That is all Canada is trying to do in her
relations with the United States at the present
time. There is the best of good will between
the countries, and I hope it will continue.

Further, I think we should never forget
that we got immense sums of money under
the Marshall Aid plan-and this helped to
keep a balanced budget-when the Americans
put up billions of dollars to build up devastated Europe. We should be quite grateful for
that help.
Hon. Mr. Euler: May I interrupt my friend?
I hope he is not giving the impression that
Canada received any of the Marshall Aid
money directly.
Hon. Mr. Horner: Not directly, no, but we
sold hundreds of millions of bushels of wheat
under it.
Hon. Mr. Euler: We got nothing directly.
Hon. Mr. Horner: No, I did not intend to
say that.
I should like to touch on another matter,
now that we are starting the summer season.
Perhaps honourable senators read in the
press, as I did, that different countries, such
as Poland, France, and perhaps Germany,
are setting up full-time agents and offices in
this country to secure tourists and travellers
to their countries. A great many Canadians
are spending a lot of money travelling abroad
including, I believe, many Canadians who
have seen but a small part of their own
country. The number of tourists coming
from the United States to Canada has been
falling off at an alarming rate, while the
money being spent by Canadians outside
the country has increased rapidly.
I think it was in the Globe and Mail I read
an article criticizing the restaurants in Canada. On former occasions I have done the
same thing: I have complained that our
people for the most part do not go all out to
welcome American tourists to Canada, and
possibly do not make enough effort to serve
the type of meals these folks like to have when
they are travelling. The same criticism applies to accommodation. In my experience
prices are higher here than in the States. I
would like to see every Canadian an ambassador who would make a point of going out of his
way to extend the hand of friendship to
tourists, no matter what country they come
from. After all, we have a great country to
show them: we have many beautiful lakes,
abundant fishing and a really great country
generally. In the West we have the Rockies,
Banff and Jasper National parks, and in the
Maritimes we have other beautiful parks. I
think we must make a greater effort to welcome visitors.
I am told that the Chateau Laurier bas
one of the finest dining rooms in the world,
and that American tourists would love to go
there but for the difficulty in getting to the

SENATE
hotel. I see now that they intend to do what
I have been advocating for a long time, open
a road in on the promenade in front of the
hotel. That would enable cars to go in and
unload at the side door and then park behind
the hotel. With such an arrangement they
would perhaps fill up that dining room during
the summer months.
Let me refer to an old text that I have
mentioned before, but which bears repeating.
We talk about money as if it were the only
criterion in life. Everybody talks about the
large farm unit, because it bas to be large
to make money, forgetting altogether about
the many great families of Canadians who
were raised on family farms. Men have gone
out from such farms in the West and elsewhere to fil the highest posts in banks and
large companies in the country. I would long
be sorry to see that type of home abolished.
But people talk about money as if it were the
only object in life.
The honourable the junior senator from
Winnipeg (Hon. Mr. Wall) mentioned yesterday the need for large sums of money for
education and to provide scholarships. Well,
honourable senators, perhaps I am not the
one to say it, but I don't believe you can
buy oducation. When a man comes from a
family which is determined that he receive
an education, he will get it in spite of the
scarcity of money. The family will get their
own loans somewhere and will repay them
when the son gets into his job in life. In
other words, you can't buy an education; it
is not money we need. I noticed in the press
a similar statement by an Alberta manwhether an educationist or an ordinary layman I do not know-that money will not
buy an education.
I have only to add my thanks to honourable
senators for their kindly references to the
election of my sons to the House of Commons
and to say how sad I would have been if
they had not run on the grand old Conservative ticket-for instance, if they had run as
candidates of the C.C.F.

with leave of the Senate, I would move that
the names of the Honourable Senators Brunt,
Emerson and Thorvaldson be added to the
list of senators serving on the Standing
Committee on Finance.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I did not receive
notice that these names would be added.
May I ask whether there are three vacancies
on the committee?
Hon. Mr. Aselline: These appointments
would increase the membership to 30. There
would still be several vacancies left unfilled,
in case new senators are appointed who may
wish to serve on the committee.

NOVA

SCOTIA

SHARE OF INCOME TAX COLLECTED FROM
CERTAIN CORPORATIONS-INQUIRY
AND ANSWER

Hon. Wishart McL. Robertson inquired of
the Government, pursuant to notice:
(1) What was the amount paid to the Province
of Nova Scotia for the fiscal year ending March
31, 1958 of a share of income tax collected from
corporations whose main business is the distribution to, or generation for distribution to the
public of electrical energy, gas or steam (Chap.
49 Statutes of 1952)?
(2) What year's income tax collections was used
as the basis for determining the amount of the
payment?
(3) How was the amount of the above payment
determined?
(4) What were the names of the corporations
from which the above income tax was collected?
(5) As a consideration of the payment to the
Province of Nova Scotia of a share of the income
taxes collected from these corporations, is the
province required to refund such amounts to the
corporations concerned in order to reduce their
charges to their customers?

Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Honourable senators,
I have the following answer to the honourable gentleman's question:
1. $400,936.00.
2. Taxation year 1955.
3. Determined from income taxes assessed
in accordance with the requirements of the
statute for the year 1955 with minor changes
in respect of prior years that resulted from
re-assessments. The provincial share is 50
per cent of the tax on the appropriate income
of corporations concerned.
4. Information of this kind cannot be disclosed pursuant to section 133 of the Income
Tax Act.
5. No.

HON. JOSEPH A. SULLIVAN
FELICITATIONS ON APPOINTMENT AS
HONORARY SURGEON TO THE QUEEN

On the Orders of the Day:
Hon. W. M. Aseltine: Honourable senators,
before the Orders of the Day are proceeded
with I would like to call attention of honourable senators to something which I consider
to be quite important. An article appeared
in the Toronto Telegram of June 9 with
reference to an honourable member of this
chamber, the Honourable Dr. Joseph A.
Sullivan, and with leave of the Senate I
would like to read it:
Senator Joseph A. Sullivan, M.D., of Toronto, has
been appointed an honorary surgeon to the Queen
in recognition of his military service, it was
learned here today.
In that capacity he could be called on to serve
Her Majesty or any other member of the Royal
family when they visit Canada.
Government House said the appointment does
not mean Dr. Sullivan will escort Princess Margaret
when she tours Canada in July. He could be asked
to serve when she is in Toronto.
Dr. Sullivan, appointed a senator last October,
is a former Associate Professor of Otolaryngology
at the University of Toronto, and a member of its
Board of Governors.
As well as being chief of St. Michael's Hospital's
hard-of-hearing clinic and auditory research, he
is chief nose and throat consultant for the armed
forces, Defence Research Board and Civil Aviation Division of the Transport Department.
Last fall he was made a Knight Commander of
St. Gregory with distinction, by Pope Pius XII.
He was goalie for the Toronto Varsity team which
represented Canada in the 1928 Olympie Games.

I arn sure all honourable senators join
with me in congratulating the honourable
gentleman on the great distinction which has
been conferred upon him by Her Most
Gracious Majesty.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. W. Ross Macdonald: Honourable senators, I would like to join with the Leader
of the Government in extending hearty congratulations to the Honourable Senator Sullivan on this great honour which has come
to him. All I can say further is that I
hope his duties in this position will not be
so strenuous that he won't be able to join
with the other eminent surgeons and physicians in this house in looking after his
brother and sister senators when they become
ill.

BILLS-THIRD READINGS

JUNE 10, 1958
of an abolition of protective tariffs would be
quite similar, in principle at least, to the
introduction of labour-saving devices and
organization. The introduction of laboursaving devices of various kinds has not,
however, solved the unemployment problem,
nor has it met the difficulty of the rising
cost of living. I admit that the problem is
baffling, and one is rather saddened by the
hazy half-truths in this connection one constantly encounters from both platform and
press.
My purpose, of course, is not to criticize
the honourable senator from Shelburne, but
rather to assist, if I' can, with the utmost
humility, in carrying his thought just a step
farther. First let me discuss this most important question of inflation.
I would remind the house that rising prices
are the corollary of falling money. That
seems to me elementary and self-evident.
The price of an article is the amount of
money it commands in the trading market;
the amount of money an article costs depends
on the purchasing power of the money. One
balances the other. So, I submit, when we
speak of the rising cost of living as expressed
in high prices, we must think of two things:
first, the cost and expense involved in the
production of the article in question-that
is its intrinsic value; and second, the purchasing power of the dollars with which we
acquire it. There is the balance on the one
hand and the other. As I said earlier, I think
free trade would decrease to some extent the
effort and expense required in the production
of goods. It would not, however, affect the
purchasing power of the Canadian dollar. So
the remedy suggested by the honourable senator, in my judgment, would not be complete,
although it would be helpful.
I turn to another subject. If honourable
senators will glance at a dollar bill they will
note that the Bank of Canada promises to
pay the bearer one dollar on demand. Bills of
other values, of course, contain a similar promise to pay the amount of the note on demand.
That is, the Bank of Canada will give you, if
you demand redemption of your bill, another
note of exactly the same kind in exchange.
The issuers of Canadian money make no
promise of redemption and no guarantee of
its value measured in commodities. We use
it in every transaction as a measure of value,
but it is a measure of value without regard
to its own value, in much the same sense, I
suggest, as a measure of distance would be
without regard to length, or a measure of
weight without regard to avoirdupois. Little
wonder, then, that, without any standard of
value, the Canadian dollar, like currencies

in recent years both in the United States and
Great Britain, fluctuates violently.
There was a time, honourable senators,
within your memory, and certainly within
mine, when prices remained almost stationary
from year to year. We used to liken the pound
sterling to the Rock of Gibraltar, and the
Canadian dollar was equally stable. If you
promised a dollar, the dollar you paid later
on was of exactly the same value. But in
those days the pound and the dollar bore a
promise of redemption in gold, and the value
of money could not sink below the intrinsic
value of the gold content. There was no problem then of rising prices, with disastrous
effects on the cost of living, because money
was not constantly falling.
What happened? I suppose all of us here
are old enough to remember what took place
in 1914. We proceeded to pay the bill for the
waging of War No. 1 with governmental promises to pay, and very shortly, as one might
naturally expect, those promises outran our
supply of gold for their redemption. Therefore we decided, as a war measure, to cease
to pay gold in redemption of our paper money,
and as a natural result our money became
literally "scraps of paper", dependent for its
purchasing power on public sentiment only,
subject to violent fluctuations, and influenced
of course by supply and demand. The value
of money is determined by the amount in
circulation in relation to the goods and
other things to be purchased-in other words,
the use to be made of it, the demand there
is for it. With the kind of currency we use
today, if you increase the supply you decrease the value; by decreasing the supply
you increase its value.
Let me cite an illustration from that war
period as throwing light upon the present
situation. As we all remember, the war was,
for those times, exceedingly costly-indeed
all wars are-and we proceeded to pay for
it with governmental promises couched in
Victory bonds. While Victory bonds bear
interest, they are of the nature of money
very much like dollar bills: they are promises by the Government or by some bank to
pay at a later date. We forced the sale of
these Victory bonds in great quantities by
means of patriotic public campaigns. If you
will permit me to reminisce, I remember
being called upon by a committee of eminent
and patriotic citizens, some of them my personal friends, and being assured by them that
my future as a practising lawyer depended
upon my display of loyalty in this crisis, so
that I must, no matter what my situation,
buy a bond of at least $1,000. At that time
the idea of my buying a thousand-dollar
bond would have been, but for its seriousness, a joke. I was a student at the time;

SENATE
I had no money with which to buy bonds.
So I did something which I suppose,
would be obvious to anybody. I saw a friend,
I explained to him my predicament, and in
advance of my purchase of the bond I sold
it to him at a considerable discount, which
I absorbed. I was only one of thousands
who did much the same under similar pressure. What was the result? Of course, money
sagged. The value of it fell.
Let me give another illustration, drawn
from times long past. As a result of the
fall in the value of money, wheat, which prior
to the beginning of the war sold at something of the order of a dollar a bushel, rose
as high as $4 a bushel before the Government's spending spree was concluded.
It is with the changing relationship between the value of money and the value of
commodities that I am concerned at this
moment. Consider now the case of a farmer,
say in the West. He owes money to the
bank, to a mortgagee, to dealers in agricultural machinery for equipment not yet paid
for. Then comes this change in money value,
and he can pay off his indebtedness with the
proceeds of one-half or one-third of the
amount of wheat which it would have cost
him prior to the opening of the war. The
balance he sells as pure profit. I remember
well that that period marked the first time
I heard of farmers spending their winters in
Florida. I am sure it was also the first time
I heard the somewhat humorous but ironic
expression known as the farmer's prayer-a
prayer for a big harvest and a bloody war.
The farmer was not the only one in that
position. Take the merchants in the cities
and towns. Shoes which had been selling at
$5 a pair suddenly became worth $10 a pair;
and I am putting the case moderately, for
the increase was more than double. So, as
a result of the change in money relationships that followed the outbreak of war, the
shoe merchant found that he could pay his
rent with the proceeds of one-half the
number of pairs of shoes it would have
required before the outbreak of war. The
balance remained for profit. Businesses all
over the country from one coast to the other
were similarly affected, and so we had a
boom in business. Business rushed forward
and profits were readily made. Anyone could
start business and make money.
When the war broke out Canada, in my
memory, was in the throes of a terrible
depression. Honourable senators may remember stories about towns that were subdivided for miles into the countryside. No
doubt you will remember stories about
speculators who made fortunes in land
values over night. Land values in cities and

towns, in the country and on farms from
coast to coast skyrocketed. We were just
concluding a period of railroad expansion,
and money in large sums had come to Canada
from United Kingdom investors. With the
shadow of war and perhaps the conclusion
of railroad building, this source of money
dried up, and this check to our economy was
sufficient to burst the land boom.
When I went to Toronto, in 1914, I found
a terrible condition of bankruptcy and unemployment. I remember seeing men lined
up in queues four deep and a block long
waiting for a handout at a soup kitchen
which was supported for the most part by
private charity. By 1915 or 1916 all this
had disappeared. As a result of the change
in money values rents had been cut from
one-half to one-third and all debts, mortgages, bonds, promissory notes, open accounts and everything else in the way of
debts were cut at least in two. That is why
business boomed.
Now let me give the other side of the
picture. Those whose interests were purely
that of the creditor-and they were numerous
and important-lost value in their money.
Their credits remained the same when
measured in dollars but the dollars were
very much less valuable. The creditors were
the ones who put up the price of the business
boom. Those on fixed incomes, such as
pensioners, and those who were paid under an
arrangement whereby they received a certain number of dollars, suffered severely.
The honourable senator from Shelburne, in
his eloquent speech during this debate,
described the conditions that faced the pensioner, and he did not overstate the case.
Wage earners were adversely affected, but
only until new wage rates could be negotiated
or forced by competition or by labour union
action.
Honourable senators, I have told of this
experience because of the light that it throws
upon the principles involved in what we
often talk rather lightly about as inflation.
While I try to understand the effect of
movements of this kind, I do not advocate
this kind of business prosperity. I am for an
honest dollar; that is to say, a dollar which
has the same value today which it had
yesterday and which it will have tomorrow.
I ask for an honest measure of value, a
measure that does not vary and that means
the same when it is paid as it did when it
was promised.
We have heard a good deal of the chaos
that can result from inflation running wild.
It can be a terrible disaster. We all know
what happened in Germany after the war.
I remember a story at the time of some

JUNE 10, 1958
chap who bought a mill and subsequently
paid for it with a bag of flour. Such carryings on in public business are utterly
dishonest. Decreasing money values is unfair
to the creditor, irrespective of the degree of
inflation. Inflation can bring about chaos
when money becomes so unreliable that
business can no longer be carried on.
I have talked about decreasing values in
money. On the other hand, rising money can
be even more disastrous. It may be much
desired by the creditor class but it is ruinous
to debtors. Most people engaged in active
manufacture-merchants, farmers and businessmen-are debtors. You cannot carry on
active business, at least few people can, and
not be in the debtor class. If you increase the
value of money you multiply the debt, with
resulting chaos. It is all right to talk about
lowering the cost of living by increasing the
value of the dollar, but the concomitants of
rising money are epidemics of bankruptcy,
business tragedies, farm disasters and commercial chaos. That is why I say that from
both standpoints-falling money and rising
money-I am for honest money, money that
stays put.
Honourable senators, I submit that it is
most desirable that we in this chamber bear
actively in mind these fundamental principles
that I have tried to make clear and that we
realize the self-interest of the various classes
who urge at different times various courses
of action on the part of government. It is most
important to bear in mind continually that
rising prices are a corollary of falling money,
and that money is the responsibility of government. It is of no use for the Government
to bluff that it cannot handle this question;
the value of money is entirely within its
control.
It is equally important, if we rule out a
shot in the arm in our economy as the method
of getting out of a depression-and I think,
and hope, that we all do so-to bear in mind
that the basic cause of our present depression
-or recession, if you want me to be politeis the skyrocketing of land values and cruelly
exorbitant rents. This is a general condition
prevailing from coast to coast, and which is
figured in tremendous sums of money. This
land value movement has taken a long time
to develop, but it has steadily and relentlessly
progressed until today a slight check in our
economy makes it almost impossible for business to bear the burden. We are experiencing
that stalemate in Canada at the present time.
Further, we should bear in mind that the true
remedy for such a condition is a generous
measure of land value taxation, rather than
monkeying with this buzz-saw of inflation.

There is something rather remarkable
about the present depression in that falling
money-and we have had that, as honourable
senators know-has not yet enabled business
to absorb unemployment. The honourable
senator from Shelburne told us that prices
have advanced to 3.4 points in the year
ending March 31 last; and the honourable the
junior senator from Winnipeg (Hon. Mr.
Wall) gave us some startling percentages of
the increase in prices, which of course means
a decrease in money values. But evidently
money has not yet fallen sufficiently to offset
the stalling effect upon business of inflated
land values and excessive rents. The individual suffering of the unemployed has been
softened in this particular depression by the
social legislation of the former Government,
and the disasters of bankruptcies and forced
reorganizations have not yet reduced the cost
of business to a point where enterprise can
again restore full employment. That, in my
opinion, is where we are at the moment. The
lowering of tariffs would help, I think, in
promoting business activity, by permitting
producers to buy in the cheapest and sell
in the dearest markets; but one can expect
very little help in that regard from the
protectionist Conservative Government now
in office, and the Government's spending
spree is rapidly gathering momentum; the
public debt is rapidly increasing.
These
things are highly inflationary. I submit that
the honourable senator from Shelburne was
absolutely right when he stated his expectation of further increases in the cost of living.
Honourable senators, a very serious situation is facing Canada, and no doubt each
one of you has in his mind to say, "What
are you going to do about it?" Well, I have
some suggestions. First, I think we should
establish an honest dollar in Canada, a dollar
with the least possible fluctuation in purchasing power, and that we should accomplish that by restoring the gold standard.
Secondly, I think that we should seek to
reduce the intolerable burden of excessive
land values and cruelly high rents by a
liberal measure of land value taxation; that
of course may be done either by municipal
or provincial Governments or the dominion
government; I know of no reason why it
should not be done by the dominion Government.
Thirdly, we should increase our
international trade by every means possible,
including reductions or abolitions of tariffs
and other obstructions, trade quotas, and
all restrictions of that kind.
Honourable senators, I am not so young
or so naïve as to imagine that these suggestions will be carried into effect at once,
or will be carried out at all-under the present

SENATE
Conservative Government. I have nevertheless thought it fit to present these thoughts
before you, because here in the Senate the
public good can be discussed without rancour, without undue political bias, and with
an earnest open-minded seeking for that
truth which, we are told, makes men free.
Here in the quiet of a tolerant Senate we
can, perhaps, develop that vision without
which the people perish.

charge of the reference section, wherefrom does
each one come, and what are the qualifications and
duties of each one?
14. Who will decide whether the ninety per cent
of the documents, without any historical or departmental value, will be burned in the Public Works
incinerator or will go to the junk man?
15. Who has already established a proportion of
ten per cent of millions of separate documents with
any historical or departmental value and of ninety
per cent of millions of other separate documents
without any historical value and how and when
was it done?
16. Is the Canadian Government following the
precedent of the United States Government, which
made an operation similar to "Sausage Mill"?
17. Until now, how many of those documents
have been (a) preserved for having a departmental
or historical value (b) incinerated or (c) sold to
the junk man?
18. Is it the intention of the Government to give
back to the Provinces the thousands of bound
volumes containing records of the old Department
of the Interior, "many of which date back to
Confederation and include early land grants,
mining rights, etc."?

That matter is of great importance owing to
the mining rights in the Prairie Provinces
and in the other provinces too.

ADDITIONS TO MEMBERSHIP

Hon. W. M. Aseltine: Honourable senators,

in accordance with the notice I gave yesterday I now move that the names of the
Honourable Senators Brunt, Emerson and
Thorvaldson be added to the list of senators
serving on the Standing Committee on
Finance.
Motion agreed to.
SPEECH FROM THE THRONE
MOTION FOR ADDRESS IN REPLYDEBATE CONTINUED

The Senate resumed from yesterday consideration of His Excellency the Governor
General's speech at the opening of the session, and the motion of Hon. Mr. Monette,
seconded by Hon. Mr. Thorvaldson, for an
Address in reply thereto.
Hon. Sydney J. Smith (Kamloops): Honourable senators, as I rise to participate in the
Throne Speech debate in the Twenty-Fourth
Parliament I am reminded of my early days
in this house, when I had the honour of
seconding the motion to adopt the Speech
from the Throne, during the Twenty-Second
Parliament. I know many of my honourable
colleagues who have joined us in the intervening months will understand me well when
I say that my early activities here were
enshrouded in fear. I received a lot of good
advice from my friends, as no doubt all of you
have, and one admonition that has remained
fixed in my mind was given me by one of

the veterans who was endeavouring to impress me with the necessity of exercising
patience, caution and prudence. In order to
bring his point home he said to me, "You
know, it takes the average member for Parliament the first year and a half he is in Ottawa
to learn how to hang up his hat and coat."
Well, honourable senators, that was about a
year and a half ago and, as a toddler now,
I feel the urge to go exploring. That is the
spirit in which I am going to attempt to tell
you some things today that I feel it my duty
to draw to your attention.
However, before launching into the substance of my address, I wish to associate
myself with the complimentary remarks of
previous speakers directed to the Honourable
the Speaker, the Honourable the Leader of
the Government (Hon. Mr. Aseltine), the Honourable the Leader of the Opposition (Hon.
Mr. Macdonald), and particularly those two
honourable senators who moved and seconded
the motion which is under debate. I wish to
discuss some matters of pertinent import
to British Columbia. While I have the honour
to represent the very best portion of the
province, known as the Interior, I am going
to take the liberty of trespassing on all parts
of the beautiful province of British Columbia.
The people of our province are this year
celebrating a Centenary. There have been
kind references and good wishes expressed
on both sides of this house toward the province of British Columbia in its Centennial
year. This is an indication that there is
nation-wide knowledge of our Centenary
project. I would like to have the gift of
an artist or a poet to give honourable senators a proper picture of the gala program
which is now under way and will be carried
out in every community in our province
throughout the whole year of 1958. Communities are vying with one another in their
local Centennial projects. Some are building
swimming pools, others ice arenas, libraries,
et cetera.
To detail a complete list of
centennial projects under way throughout
the entire province I would eventually have to
refer to every institution that is the pride
and joy of communities every place. This
part of the program, of course, will provide
a permanent and useful monument to the
occasion, but material acquisitions are only
a small part of the overall program. The
arts and crafts and humanities are coming in
for their share of attention. To augment
the whole program citizens of British
Columbia-and when I say 'citizens' I include
corporations and organizations of every kind
-I say the people of British Columbia have
entered into the spirit of Centennial year in
various ways. Some have taken great pains
to have their grounds appropriately laid out

JUNE 11, 1958

and planted. Others have gone to great expense to decorate their premises and, all in
all, British Columbians are conscious of their
responsibility as hosts to more visitors than
have ever holidayed in our province in any
previous year.
I don't think I can better emphasize the
extent to which British Columbia has gone
all out this year than to remind you that
the coming visit of Her Royal Highness
Princess Margaret to Canada is basically for
the purpose of her visiting British Columbia,
where she is going to be our guest for 14 days.
As I have stated, every community in the
province is participating but, naturally, the
larger centres, with varied and extensive
facilities, are going to be the focal points
for the greater activities. In this respect I
want to refer to Vancouver Island. This
island lies off the mainland to the west and
is accessible only by water and by air. It
is almost as large as the province of Prince
Edward Island and has a population of about
150,000. Victoria, our provincial capital, is
located on the southern extremity of Vancouver Island and the very fact that it is our
capital city makes it a magnet that draws a
large percentage of visitors that come to our
province. Although in recent years air travel
has become very common, nevertheless the
basic life-line of Vancouver Island has been
the ferry service between the island and the
mainland. The C.P.R. has played a very important role in this ferry service. It has a
very fine fleet of steamships, numbering 10
in all. These ships have a total gross tonnage
of 44,000 tons, passenger facilities for 11,830,
sleeping accommodation for 1,285, and a
capacity for 498 automobiles.
Everything was going just fine and dandy
in connection with the big Centennial holiday
year until 350 employees of the C.P.R. Steamships-members of the Steafarers International Union-went out on strike on Friday
night, May 16. As a result of this strike the
10 C.P.R. boats are lying idle in harbour at
Vancouver, Victoria and Nanaimo. On May
27 the federal Government announced the
appointment of Eric G. Taylor, of Toronto,
as a mediator who was to make an effort to
get the strike settled. However, Mr. Taylor
returned to eastern Canada last week without
having accomplished anything. Needless to
say, the people of British Columbia, who
were hopeful and patient, are feeling very
discouraged over the outcome, and particularly so because of indications that this strike
may drift into a long-drawn-out battle. This
strike is approaching the end of the fourth
week-the day after tomorrow, to be exact.
During this four-week period the loss suffered by the tourist service industry on Vancouver Island is reliably estimated to exceed

$2 million. More than a week ago it was reported that over 30,000 reservations had
been cancelled. Honourable senators, I cannot
possibly convey to you what an injury our
economy will suffer if this strike is prolonged
indefinitely.
It will be felt worst on Vancouver Island:
it will be just terrible for the province of
British Columbia. But the loss does not end
there. It is a national calamity. Direct losses
will affect every level of tax collections;
unemployment will be increased; building and
capital expansion in the tourist industry will
be cancelled. One province cannot suffer a
setback like this without it affecting Canada
as a whole.
There has been no announcement by the
Government regarding mediator Taylor's return to eastern Canada, but a member of the
Opposition in the other place yesterday asked
the following question:
Mr. Speaker, I should like to direct a question to
the Acting Minister of Labour. Have negotiations
between the federal mediator, the Canadian Pacific
Railway and the Seafarers' International Union,
involving a strike of steamship services on the
west coast, broken down as reported in yesterday's
press? If so what action, if any, is now contemplated by the Government to bring an end to
this costly strike?

The Honourable Acting Minister of Labour
answered this question in the following
manner:
Mr. Speaker, I believe I have the same press
clipping that the hon. member has. It is correct to
say that negotiations have not broken down. The
hon. member will notice in the press release that
the mediator Is quoted as saying, "I am not
abandoning my inquiry, but I am suspending it
for the time being". That is the situation at the
present time.

This question and answer are recorded on
page 987 of the Commons Hansard for Tuesday, June 10.
This answer, naturally, left the impression
that the efforts of Mr. Taylor had not broken
down, which is not according to statements
made by Mr. Taylor himself in press interviews in Vancouver before he left there.
The Vancouver Sun of Tuesday, June 3,
reports as follows:
Federal mediator Eric Taylor warned today the
Canadian Pacifie Railway ship strike "will continue Indefinitely".
"Talks between representatives of the C.P.R. and striking Seafarers International Union broke down Monday". Mr. Taylor
said: "No further meetings have yet been planned
and talks have been suspended for today. All I
can say at the moment Is that the C.P.R. strike will
go on indefinitely."

The Vancouver Daily Province of Tuesday,
June 3, reports as follows:
The first attempt to end the 18-day C.P.R. ship
strike has failed. Special mediator Eric G. Taylor
said Monday after a three-hour parley with both
sides: "Nothing transpired to indicate that the
strike will not continue indefinitely." A spokesman
for the C.P.R. also confirmed the session had been

SENATE
fruitless.

And

he added that no

concerned. The company repeated
fleet was operating at a loss, and
increased grant would have to

arrangements
all the parties
that the coast
said that any

In reporting further regarding the breakdown of negotiations, the Vancouver Daily
Province of June 7 says:
What appears to be the failure of his (Mr.
Taylor's) mission has apparently been brought
about by complications going beyond the Seafarers'
dispute with the C.P.R. Said an informed source:
"The Marine Engineers and the Masters and Mates
have also registered strike votes on the C.P.R.
fleet and on Black Ball. Everyone is waiting to
see what the other will do. That applies to both
the companies and the unions."

In the same article Mr. Taylor is reported
as having said:
Other disputes are having an impact on the S.I.U.
problem.

The article continues:
He stressed his brief extended solely to the
S.I.U.-C.P.R. dispute and that he could take no
official notice of other differences on the waterfront.
No final report would be handed to the federal
Government as yet. This would leave room for
the possibility of further developments.

The foregoing quotations from press interviews with the mediator would indicate,
without doubt, that he has given up hope of
accomplishing a settlement under existing
circumstances.
You will note from this latter statement
by Mr. Taylor that his terms of reference
were too restricted to permit him to bring
about a settlement. The fact that there are
other disputes than the one referred to him
confirms the fact that Mr. Taylor was beaten
before he started in his efforts to bring about
a settlement. If the Government has a
sincere desire to bring an end to this strike
it will extend the terms of Mr. Taylor's commission so that he can deal with all disputes
involved in the tie-up.
Another significant point repeated in press
reports of Mr. Taylor's efforts while at the
coast is te the effect that the C.P.R. has been
losing money on the operation. Perhaps it
has been losing money. Perhaps it has been
saving money during the weeks that its ships
have been tied up and it may not be too
anxious to sec the strike settled. As a matter
of fact it is reported in the Vancouver Daily
Province of June 3, that the C.P.R. is considering a British offer to buy part of its
west coast steamship fleet. This paper quotes
Mr. J. N. Fraine, Vice-President of the
C.P.R.'s Pacific Division, as confirming reports
current in Vancouver and Montreal that some
of his ships are on the block.
Honourable senators, this report is the most
alarming item in this gloomy story of the
steamship tie-up in British Columbia. I am
sure Canada has not yet recovered from the

shock it experienced when the Government
announced that the Atlantic coast fleet of
Canadian National (West Indies) Steamships
Ltd. was being sold. It seems a tragedy to
learn that sale of the Pacific Coast fleet of
the C.P.R. is being considered. It is reported
that the C.P.R. has prepared a statement
which has been in the hands of President
N. R. Crump for some weeks, relative to
their operation of B.C. Steamships, which
belong to the C.P.R. I am wondering if this
report has been made available to the
Government.
Much as I disagree with the general principle of subsidies, nevertheless I would suggest that if on investigation the Government
finds that B.C. Steamships cannot operate a
service between Vancouver Island and the
mainland of British Columbia without a
subsidy, then consideration should be given
to negotiating a satisfactory subsidy in order
to revive the vital service. There is ample
precedent for the Government to pay such
a subsidy. It is now passing out millions of
dollars in subsidies to shipping operations on
the Atlantic coast, operations furnishing a
similar service to that which the C.P.R. boats
have been furnishing in British Columbia.
If, on the other hand, a thorough investigation reveals the fact that the present
fleet of the C.P.R. is obsolete and unable to
compete with a more modern type of ferry,
then the solution would be to negotiate for
a new type of ferry, possibly plying a shorter
course. But in this case provision should be
made for resumption of service by the present
fleet until a new fleet of ferries would be
available.
So much for our province and our problem.
I am not unmindful that British Columbia is
not alone in suffering the results of a labour
tie-up that affects not only the employees and
the employers involved but also the general
public. Our modern economy has become so
complex that there are many incidents of
labour disputes that affect large sections of
When a labour dispute
our population.
causes grievous hardship to members of the
public I am strongly of the opinion that
strikes and lockouts should be prohibited. I
hasten to say I am firmly convinced that
labour should have the right to bargain collectively and, under ordinary circumstances,
the right to withhold its services in order to
induce management to meet its demands. As
long as the dispute involves only labour and
management I would not attempt to restrict
the right to strike to those cases in which some
Government official feels that there is merit
in the demand being made by labour, because
in a democracy a person has the right to be
wrong-as long as he does not hurt innocent

JUNE 11, 1958
people. Nor would I restrict the right of an
employer to lock out bis employees under
such circunistances.
It seems to me that in seeking the dividing
lime between disputes where strikes and lockouts are to be allowed and those where they
are to be prohibited, one niight say that if the
inidustry or service is of such public importance that it is regulated by the Public
Utilities Commission in the provincial field
or the Board of Transport Commissioners in
the federal field, then that industry or service
is of sucb importance to the public that strikes
and lockouts should be illegal, and that any
differences which cannot be settled amicabiy
should be settled by compulsory arbitration
or, better still, by a labour court set up for
the sole purpose of dealing with labour disputes. The terni "'compulsory arbitration" is
offensive to mnany people, and yet the terni
"bînding conciliation," which is only another
way of saying the saine thing, has been accepted by the police and fire unions for many
years without any suggestion having been
made that their nienbers have suffered in
any way as a result of being denied the right
to strike.
As far as the dispute which ties up the
C.P.R. ships is concerned, it is niy specifle
suggestion that Parlianient should take inmediate action to extend the period of the
collective agreenient between the C.P.R. and
the S.I.U. until such tume as the parties can
agree upon the ternis of a new collective
agreemient. This course was successfully followed by a previous administration when both
our transcontinental railways went on strike,
and the railways began to run in a niatter 0f
a few days.
I do not assert that the C.P.R. is right and
the S.I.U. is wrong in the contract negotiations. 1 do not assert that either party has
shown less than the best of faith in the collective bargaining. But I do assert that they
are both wrong when the resu1t of their action
is irreparable damiage to the general public.
I do not believe that the Governnient is
getting any conifort out of the fact that a
lot of people in British Colunibia are suffering heavy losses. Neither do I believe that
this Governent is foolish enough to allow
this strike to continue indeflnitely when the
Government itself stands to suifer heavy
losses during its continuance. But I do believe, along with the masses in British Columibia, that the Governnient has utterly
failed to take this situation seriously. As
evidence of this lack of interest, I would remind you that there are 18 Government
nienbers-including three ministers-froni
British Columnbia and they have shown no
appreciable mnterest. I should not be urging
theni to do their honiework but, on behaif of
British Columbia, I do earnestly do so. I have

full confidence that the Government is going
to face up to this probleni sooner or later.
I earnestly urge it to niake it sooner. I Miost
sincerely hope that the honourable the Leader
of the Government in this bouse (Hon. Mr.
Aseltine) will exert the full weight of his
good offices on bis Government to take some
definite, effective and inimediate action to
bring this strike to an end.
Han. Mr. Lambert: Would tbe honourable
gentleman permit me to ask just one question? Would he tell us what the precise issue
is between the parties to this strike he bas
referred to? If he has already explained this
I failed to hear him.
Hon, Mr. Smith (Kamloops): The Seafarers'
International Union was asking for an increase of 25 per cent in wages. The C.P.R.
had offered theni an increase of 8 per cent.
Wbile the negotiations were going on the
conipany settled with another union involving
700 eniployees on the saine boats, who belonged to the Clerks' Union, for an increase
of 8 per cent.
Han, J. W. Cameau: Honourable senators,
I wisb to join with the other honourable
senators who have spoken, in off ering niy
sincere congratulations to the Honourable
Speaker of the Senate, and also to the Honourable Leader of the Government (Hon.
Mr. Aseltine) and the Honourable Leader
0f the Opposition
(Hon. Mr. Macdonald).
I arn not going to expose their virtues, because I tbink it would be superfluous. The
bonourable senator froni De la Durantaye
(Hon. Mr. Pouliot) did it very well with respect
to the Honourable Leader of the Government
this afternoon; so I will proceed with the
few remarks I have to make. They have
to do with what I know will be a very
dry subject for most senators, for I want to
say a f ew words about one branch of the
fisheries of the Maritime provinces. With
the leave of the Senate I would like to read
an excerpt from the Halifax Chronicle-Herald
of June 5, bearing the caption "Fisheries
Scientists in Session":
Scientists engaged in fisheries research in varlous
parts of the world are comparlng notes in Halifax
this week-jn conjunction with the meeting of the
International
commission
for
the
Northwest
Atlantic Fisheries which opens in Halifax on
Monday.
The biologists and marine research experts began
their talks and panel discussions yesterday at the
administration building of Dalhousie University.
Representatives of il of the 12 member-countries
of the Commission were in attendance.
Russia,
the latest country to join the convention, was not
represented at the openlng-day meetings but the
U.S.S.R. delegates are expected to arrive today.
Dr. Lionel Walford. Washington, D.C., chief of
the Atlantic Oceanographic
Fisheries Research
Centre of U.S. Commercial Fisherles. is preslcling
over the meetings.

SENATE
Conservation of the fisheries of the Northwest
Atlantic is the main concerni of the convention.
Dr. Walford said "We are trying bo develop a
scientifie basis for the rational utilization of the
rcsources of these waters."
Honourable senators, there is one branch
of the fisheries in which I arn very much
concernied, that is, the lobster fisheries. I
started with lobsters myseif about 56 years
ago, and bought them for a great rnany years.
I view with alarm the fact that lobsters
have been gradually decreasing, and I arn
afraid that if il continues that way the lobster fisheries will, within a few years, becorne a thing of the past.
I notice thal the federal Deparîrnent of
Fisheries is experimenting on new ways of
calching lobsters. Il bas developed a new trap
this year. Divers have been sent 10 the west
part of Nova Scotia 10 study how lobsters are
getling mbt the traps, and they have ben
taggirg lobsters during recent years 10 fnd
out how f ast they were travelling. I corrnend the deparîrnent for having done al
those things, but I would like 10 see something donc, if aI ail possible, 10 mnultiply or
10 try 10 restore the lobsters and 10 try 10
increase the catch. Maybe that is hoping for
100 much, but I sec that in Nova Scotia
there arc two fish hatcheries in which Irout
arc hatched 10 rcplcnish the lakcs and rivers
of the province. I really believe il would be
feasible 10 have a lobster hatchery, but I may
be absolutcly \vrong. Howcver, il bas been
rny drcarn for quite a long lime 10 have a
lobster halchery, and since I believe il would
be feasible I would like to sec one startcd.
I do not suggest for a moment thal a large
arnount of money should be grantcd; I believe
thal $4,000 or $5,000 as an experiment would
f11l the bill, and thon if il provcd successful
the deparîmnent could enlarge.
Senalors who corne frorn the Maritime
provinces have sccn lobsters wilh lhousands
of srnall spawns attachcd 10 them. Fishermen
caîl lhem eggs, but they are rcally spawns,
about the size of a turnip secd. If Ihose eggs,
or spawns, were hatched and allowed 10 grow,
one lobster would supply 25 fishermen for a
whole season. At present, in the absence of
hatcheries, I arn afraid thal aftcr the spawns

experiment, perhaps five or six feet long,

or six of these spawn lobsters were put in a
val, the experirnent would be well worlh
while. When fishermen catch them with the
eggs or spawns attached lhey are supposed 10
put thern back in the sea. Well, if five or six
of those were put in a val and installed in

a small building with glass observation windows, then a scientist-a biologist, if you
prefer that terrn-could study the hatcbing
and growth of these lobsters, and I believe
this experiment would be most profitable for
the fishermen. If the young lobsters were lef t
in that vat until they formed their sheli and
grew to two and a haîf inches or three inches
long, and then, as is done with trout fingerlings, if they were to put them back int the
sea, they could take care of themselves and
not be destroyed as they are today.

JUNE 11, 1958

Hon. George H. Barbour: Honourable
senators, I first want to congratulate the
Honourable the Speaker on his reappointment
to the high office which he so eminently
filled during the last session. Also I want
to compliment the new senators. I am sure
they have found in this chamber the friendly
feeling which former senators found when
they first came here. To the mover and the
seconder of the motion for an Address I
extend my warmest congratulations on the
high order and excellent delivery of their
speeches.
To the retiring Leader of the Government
(Hon. Mr. Haig) I would like to extend very
best wishes, and the hope that he will continue to serve in the Senate for many years
to come. To the new Leader (Hon. Mr.
Aseltine) I want to say that if I were asked
what qualifications a man should have in
order to equip him to occupy this position I
could not think of anything better than
service in this chamber and participation in
its deliberations for 22 years under Liberal
leadership. I feel honourable senators will
agree with me that our new leader is well
qualified, and we are glad to see him in that
position.
I turn now to the Speech from the Throne,
one paragraph of which reads as follows:
My Government regrets to have to report that
efforts to avert a strike of firemen on the Canadian
Pacific Railway were unsuccessful.

I am sure all honourable senators will
agree with the Government in that statement.
This country is what it is because people
worked, and worked hard. Honourable
senators who are here in this house did not
come through life along an easy path, but
rather they worked hard and produced for
the country. Now, the Canadian Pacific Railway is a private organization. We also have
a Governrnent-owned railway, the Canadian
National. If you travel from Halifax to Vancouver and observe the trains that you travel
on, go through the different railway stations
and yards-in Moncton, for instance, the
Canadian National is building a freight yard
which covers eight acres of ground-and take
a look at the trackage in Montreal and all
over the country, you cannot help being impressed by the tremendous amount of equipment that is in use.
I believe all honourable senators have
received a copy of the annual report of the
Canadian National Railways. In it I read
that the company is asking for more money
at this time when the cost of living is about
the highest in any period in our history. The
report contains a chart which shows that
employees receive 56.8 per cent of the dollar
that the railway takes in, plus 5.4 per cent
in pensions and health and welfare benefits,
57075-4-11J

making a total of 62.2 per cent. I think it
is time the railwaymen considered the fact
that the railway needs a greater share of
this revenue than it is now getting, in view
of the balance sheet for this year which
shows a deficit of $29,500,000. I have known
quite a few railwaymen who were looking
for jobs, and there always seemed to be a
dozen or more looking for the one job; but
after the men were placed in a job for a
while they began to look for more pay. I
do not think it is always the men themselves
who are seeking higher pay, but that some
of the officials higher up urge them to do so.
Hon. Mr. Quinn: It is the agitators, the
officials of the labour organizations.
Hon. Mr. Barbour: I mean the officials of
the union.
The Speech from the Throne has this also
to say:
You will be asked immediately to amend the
Unemployment Insurance Act in order to extend
for a further six weeks, during the current year,
the period during which special seasonal benefits
may be paid.

I think this Government should have a
very warm spot in its heart for the St.
Laurent administration, the last Liberal Government. When the present administration
came into office, in June 1957, it found during the following winter that there was
more unemployment than there had been in
previous years. It also found that through
wise planning and sound legislation on the
part of the previous administration there was
more than $900 million in the Unemployment Insurance Fund. Now, it did not take
much thought or planning to extend by two
months the period during which unemployment benefits would be paid. That is what
the Government chose to do last session. At
the present. session we have already passed
legislation granting a further extension for
the payment of seasonal unemployment
benefits until June 29.
I am of the opinion that this action is not
going to help the present Government. The
Unemployment Insurance Act was created
for a purpose, namely, to carry people over
the winter months when unemployment
occurred, and the employee, the employer
and the Government contributed to the fund.
The extension of time over which benefits
may be paid will, I think, create unemployment rather than prevent it. If times next
winter are about as they are now I would
not be at all surprised if we have more and
more people looking for unemployment
insurance.
I come next to the housing bill, under
which some $350 million was allocated for
the building of houses. I wonder whether

SENATE

this money was not provided principally
to create work rather than to build houses
for people who need a place to live in. If
the purpose was to create employment, then
I think the Government is getting into a vulnerable position. It is supplying money or
guaranteeing the loan of money to build
houses, and is selling them to the people.
This is a type of class legislation, because
a prospective purchaser has to be earning
so much money be'ore he can buy such a
house.
I do not want to preach blue ruin, but
I would remind honourable senators of the
Farmers' Creditors Arrangement Act which
was brought in to assist farmers by reducing
the principal and interest payments which
they were committed to pay. The terms
of purchase under which many of the first
farms were bought by returned men after the
First World War had to be changed. It is
quite possible that some day something of
that nature may have to be done to assist
the people who are now buying houses with
heavy carrying charges.
Honourable senators, I did not intend to
speak in this debate, and I would not have
taken part in it, but for the fact that I
wished to refer to a measure which Parliament passed last session known as the Agricultural Stabilization Act. On this subject
the Speech from the Throne has this to
say:
Unremitting efforts are being made to sell
Canadian agricultural and fisheries products in the
markets of the world and considerably larger
exports of wheat and cattle have been made.
Support prices have now been established for a
considerable number of products under the Agricultural Stabilization Act to carry into effect, for
the current year, the desire of Parliament that
agriculture should be thus assisted to realize fair
returns for its labour and investment.

Honourable senators will recall that that
legislation named nine commodities which
were to have a floor price of 80 per cent
of the average price for the previous 10 years.
When the bill was before the Senate I asked
why potatoes were not included in the list
of commodities, because they are a very
important item in the economy of Prince
Edward Island. I was told that potatoes
were provided for in another part of the
bill.
During the recent election campaign Liberal
speakers claimed that potatoes were not protected by this legislation, and on the television
and over the radio I heard Government
speakers say that they were protected. Indeed,
I heard one minister say that the floor was
not limited to 80 per cent of the average price
but could go as high as $1.30. As honourable
senators know, the price of potatoes often
fluctuates a good deal in a short time. In
March there were snow storms, the roads

were bad and at one time the cold weather
pushed the price of potatoes up to $2.50 for
75 pounds; it levelled off to $2, and then went
down and down until they are now selling at
50 cents or less for 75 pounds. A delegation
of two representatives of the potato growers
in my province came to Ottawa to see what
could be done about it, but nothing happened.
Then a week or ten days ago the provincial
Minister of Agriculture came up here, bringing with him the President and other members of the Marketing Board. On their return
they said they had met with members of the
Government who were interested in their
problem, but nothing was done about it. The
editor of the Charlottetown Guardian which
is and has been for many years a strong Conservative paper, wrote a scorching editorialI have it in my room, but did not bring it
down to the chamber-asking why the potato
growers were not being taken care of under
the Agricultural Stabilization Act.
Potatoes certainly mean a good deal to the
economy of our people. Last winter, especially
in March and April, there was a lot of snow.
The roads were plowed with snow-plows;
there was no frost in the ground; and people
whose potatoes were stored a few miles from
the railroad, say six or eight miles away,
found it impossible to get them out, while
those who had them in warehouses nearby
were able to sell them. Now these people with
unsold potatoes are in an unfortunate position, and the Government, so far as I know,
has done nothing about it. This week both
the ex-leader and the present leader of the
Conservative party in the province came to
Ottawa about this business, having taken the
trouble to drive all the way. I have known
them for many years, and they are fine men.
They are now on their way back, and so far
as I know, no action has been taken.
Now, potato farmers are not "pikers". If
the Government does not intend to live up to
its contract or do what it promised to do, I
believe they will be quite satisfied to have
potatoes and other vegetables removed from
the Agrieultural Stabilization Act and all the
other measures which were taken to support
vegetable prices. Then they would know that
they would not get any support and they
would be on their own. A good many of them,
in fact, would rather be in that position. But
that is the state of affairs today. I do not
know what will be done about it, but something should be done. Perhaps the honourable
Leader of the Government in the Senate (Hon.
Mr. Aseltine) will take the matter up with
the Minister of Agriculture and get some
action. When the Agricultural Stabilization
Bill was being put through the house the
sponsor told us that the price of certain
named commodities would be set early in

Since there was no authority last year for
the establishment of federal grades for leaf
tobacco, and since Ontario did have the necessary statute, that province established
grades in close consultation with the federal
Department of Agricuture. An inspection
service was provided by that department, consisting of one full-time officer and six seasonal
inspectors for the period of the auction. These
men were designated by the province as inspectors under their legislation.
The passing of this bill will permit establishment of federal grades. These grades will
then be available to growers to use as they
may wish on tobacco moving in interprovincial trade and to serve as a basis to which
provincial grades can be adapted as the need
arises.

Hon. William H. Taylor (Norfolk): Honourable senators, owing to the fact that I operated two tobacco farms for about 15 years,
perhaps I should say a few words with respect
to this bill. As the honourable senator from
Ottawa East (Hon. Mr. Choquette) just
explained, the purpose of this bill is to
amend the Canada Agricultural Products
I
Standards Act to include leaf tobacco.
would point out that we are being asked to
amend an act thas has never been proclaimed
by the Government of Canada. I believf we
can all agree that the establishment of
federal grades for livestock-including furbearing animals raised in captivity-eggs,
poultry, milk, vegetables, fruit, honey and
maple syrup, and the products thereof, have
proven beneficial to the producer, processor
and the consumer of Canada, and by adding
leaf tobacco to the present list we will do
something that will be beneficial to the
tobacco industry.
I would like to inform the honourable
senator who explained this bill that the Ontario
Flue-Cured Tobacco Association has been
grading tobacco by a system of grades set
up by the association in 1936 for the purpose
of determining distribution and price. Since
1936 the tobacco has been graded in crops
according to those standards and then soldI
on the market by crops. This did not provE

establishment of official grade standards so
that they might pack their tobacco and offer
it for sale under those grades. They had to
change the form of selling tobacco from the
crop-sale system to what is known as the
Dutch clock system, under which grades of
tobacco are put up in bales for sale. This
proved so satisfactory to producers that under
the present grading system as used by the
Ontario Flue-Cured Tobacco Growers' Marketing Board approximately 148 million pounds
of tobacco were sold within 98 days of the

can agree it worked very well.
Where grades are established by regulation
I would strongly urge that the regulated
grades be established as near as possible on
the grade basis that the producer and processor have become accustomed to, otherwise
the market would be seriously disturbed.
The honourable senator from Ottawa East
explained the method under which grading
is donc. It is graded by the provincial graders
in Ontario and then inspected by the federal
inspectors. That practice is for leaf tobacco
entirely, and just here I might explain that
the method of marketing the tobacco is that
the producer places in bales of about 70
pounds weight the leaf tobacco in different
grades, and as it is delivered to the sales
barns the graders inspect each bale of tobacco
and label it, subject to federal Government
inspection. As the tobacco is offered for sale
by the Dutch clock system it is important
that every bale of tobacco be properly graded
and labelled. As soon as it is sold it is placed
in large hogsheads of about 500 pounds, and
under certain humidity conditions it is pressed
tightly. This is the condition in which it remains for processing, aging, for one year to
18 months, before being used for the manufacture of tobacco. What I was doubtful about
with respect to the explanation of leaf tobacco
is this. When does it change from leaf tobacco
into manufactured tobacco? Is it when it is
sold by the grower to the manufacturer who
starts to process it? Is it when it goes into
storage with the manufacturer? I might say
that some of the tobacco is already stemmed
before it is put into hogshead containers. I am
in some doubt as to when tobacco is changed
from leaf tobacco into processed or manufactured tobacco.
Honourable senators, I would not expect
this bill to affect the export market greatly
as I would assume all tobacco exported is
processed, but it will affect the interprovincial trade, and the establishment of uniform

JUNE 11, 1958
grades will prove beneficial. The future of
the tobacco industry in that section of Ontario
in which I live is dependent to a great extent on the export market. Of the 160 million pounds produced in the dominion of
Canada, about 148 million pounds are produced in that area, and as a result it has
reached the saturation point, and more, for
domestic use. For that reason it is essential
that the export market be developed. We have
been exporting last year fron 25 to 40 million pounds of tobacco, but I am not sure
whether that is leaf or processed tobacco,
because none of it goes abroad until it has
been put into the processing system. I want
to urge the Government to consider assistance
to the tobacco growers in the foreign market.
A great deal of help can be given by lowering of the excise tax on cigarettes; that would
help the domestic market.
Honourable senators, I think we should
support this bill, and I am prepared and will
be pleased to vote for second reading.
Although the act has never yet been proclaimed, and we are amending it, I believe
the bill would benefit the tobacco growers of
this country.

Maple". Many manufacturers outside the
province of Quebec, as well as many in that
province, use the words "Artificial Flavouring" or "Artificial Maple Flavour" on their
labels. Not only syrup, but various kinds of
chocolates, candy, ice cream and other products are labelled as having a maple flavour,
when in fact they do not contain one drop of
maple sap. We have tried for many years
to arrive at a solution of this difficulty. As
honourable senators know, for many years
the army used the light grade in Quebec.
Some manufacturers bought poor, cheap
maple products, changed the flavour completely, and the product was practically like
poison for the army. Poor maple sugar,
artificially coloured, is sold as "pure light"
maple syrup. I do not know if the experts
can do anything to overcome this, but I
assure honourable senators that if I am asked
for some suggestions I shail be pleased to
give them. I am happy that the Quebec Government grades the products perfectly, but
unfortunately there is not the same control
when the product is shipped to other provinces, and that causes another problem.

asked to extend the act to leaf tobacco. I do
not object offhand to that, but I merely wish
to point out to the Senate that it is a very
strong piece of legislation which can be used
to restrict trading in the articles to which it
refers, very severely indeed, and we should,
I think, be careful before we add more
products to the list of articles that are to be
subject to this act. That is why I would
support reference of the bill to a standing
committee.
Hon. Mr. Asel±ine: That is quite agreeable.
Hon. Mr. Croll: Did I understand the honourable leader of the house to say that he
was agreeable to reference of this bill to
a committee?
Hon. Mr. Asel±ine: Yes.
Hon. Mr. Croll: That makes my speech
unnecessary.
Hon. W. Ross Macdonald: Honourable senators, I agree with the proposal that the bill
should be sent to committee for the reasons
which have aJready been stated. Also I
think we should have an explanation as to
why the bill witich was passed in 1955 and
received royal assent that year has not been
proclaimed. That is, I think most unusual.
There may be other unproclaimed statutes
that have been standing on the statute book
for that length of time or longer, but there
must be some special reason for the delay
in this case. I can imagine the Government
introducing a bill and, after it has been
passed, coming to the conclusion 'that it
would be better not to proclaim it. But in
this instance that is not the case. The
Government says this act is a good one; in
fact, so good that it is desirable to extend its
provisions. Now if that has been the case
for the last three years, why has it not been
proclaimed? I think we should be given a
clear explanation of that. I may be wrong,
and it may have been thought for some time
that it was not a good act. In any event we
should be told why it has not been proclaimed. Was it considered to be bad? And
has it now been decided that it is good and
will be proclaimed?
As I have said, I agree that we should
send the bill to committee. There we shall
be able to see if there is any objection to it.
I followed with great interest the address of
the honourable senator from Norfolk (Hon.
Mr. Taylor). He knows a great deal about
the grading and selling of tobacco and he
has explained that within the last year there
has been a change in the method of selling.
Certain proposals as to grading have now

been made. I recall that when the change
in procedure was first proposed there was a
great deal of controversy among the growers
as to the advisability of making this change.
My recollection is that, when the vote was
taken, there was quite strong support for the
charge, but there was some objection to it.
Now, honourable senators, I think we have
always taken the stand that a minority should
be heard, so if there is a minority which
objects to the proposed methods of grading
we should hear their voice in our committee.
For that reason, honourable senators, I
cannot see the need for any rush in passing
this bill through the house. I do not think
the committee should sit tomorrow and put
the bill through. The act has been standing
for three years, so surely we can wait a
couple of weeks. I would suggest to the
honourable Leader of the Government (Hon.
Mr. Aseltine) that if this bill goes to committee we should not set a date for the hearing on this bill for at least a week or ten days.
Hon. Felix P. Quinn: Honourable senators,

I also am wondering why this act has not
been proclaimed, and I am also wondering
why the honourable Leader of the Opposition
(Hon. Mr. Macdonald) wonders, because no
member of this chamber should be in a better
position to know the reason than he is. He
was a member of the Government that passed
the legislation in 1955 and that same Government held office until June of last year. Now,
why should he not be able to tell us the
reason why it was not proclaimed?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Honourable senators,
I happen to know one reason why it was not
proclaimed but I think we should hear the
officials of the department. This act was a
consolidation of the Canada Dairy Products
Act, the Fruit, Vegetables and Honey Act, the
Livestock and Livestock Products Act, the
Meat and Canned Foods Act and the Maple
Products Industry Act. I understand that
there are regulations under all these acts,
but apparently over all these years the department was not satisfied with the regulations that were proposed in connection with
this act. I do not wish to go into the matter
any further until we get some information
from those close to the responsibility for
carrying out that act as to why it was not
proclaimed.
Hon. W. M. Aseliine: Honourable senators,
I think I could give the explanation but I
do not propose to do so. Like the honourable
Leader of the Opposition (Hon. Mr. Macdonald) I would prefer to have departmental
officials give us the explanation in committee. I suggest that the committee should
meet tomorrow and plan how it is going to

JUNE 11, 1958
handie this bill and how far it wants ta go
with it. Probably a representative of the
Department of Agriculture could be calied in
ta give an explanation, and then the committee could decide whether it wanted ta hold
f urther meetings or flot.
Han. Mr. Macdonald: I think that is a good
idea.
Hon. Arthur W. Roebuck: Honourabie senators, I want ta say just a word about this
bill and ta thank the honourable senator from
Inkerman (Hon. Mr. Hugessen), for recaliing
ta rny mind by his speech sorne of the remarks

In other words the departrnent was taking

interfering with importation into Canada and
exportation out of Canada-foreign trade and
interprovincial trade-putting into the hands
of officiais power ta do things that I said
at that time should be reserved for Parliament only. I did not like that bill. I thought
it was another case of officiais of a department, with the bureaucratic ideas that s0
many of then rnanifest, reaching for powers
which they should not have.
However, the bull was passed, and my guess
is that the members of that department have
wanted it to be proclaimed but found resistance in cabinet circles ta doing so.
Hon. Mr. Reid: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: That is rny suggestion.
I have no knowledge, but I think that is what
it is.
Hon. Mr. Reid: That is a f act.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: They have flot got away

are wishing ta extend these powers stili

ta prociaim the bill.
Hon. Mr. Aseltin.: At the request of the

Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Well, it may be at the
request of the tobacca people, but that is flot a
good excuse for giving such wide powers ta
any department of Governiment.
Sa, hanourable senatars, I am ail for
referring this bill ta comrnittee and not acting
taa hastiiy on it. Let us take aur time about
this matter. Da nat rush it thraugh. The
hanaurable Leader of the Oppasition (Hon.
Mr. Macdonald) pointed out that the act has
stood now for three years, and in my judgment it would nat be a bad thing ta let it
stand for another three years. At ail events,
let us not push it through toa rapidly.
Han. Austin C. Taylor (Westmarland):
Honourabie senators, I would lîke ta say a
f ew words in connection with this proposed
arnendment. We are perhaps iosing sight of
the fact that the bill would not change the act
itself, but provides only for the bringing in
of one comrnodity under the regulations of the
act. This is a product which the producers
want ta corne under the provisions of the
act when it is prociaimed and when the
regulations are passed.
I have had a good deai ta do with the
administration of regulations under variaus
provincial acts, and I know what has been
the practice over the years. In the beginning it was necessary for a provincial Government only ta pass an order in council bringing
certain sections of a particular federal act
into force in that province. Later on, as
a resuit of a test case of one of the marketing
or grading acts, it was found necessary for
the province ta pass an act sîrnilar ta that
passed by the federai Governrnent in relation
ta the marketing and grading of products
which entered into interprovincial and export
trade.
As I understand it, a province has jurisdiction ta enact legislation, ta set up standards
and ta pass regulatians with respect ta any
agriculturai commodity that is sold and consurned within that province, but when that
cornmodity gaes into the interprovincial or
export trade it then cornes wlthin the jurisdiction of the federal Governrnent. Because of
that situation, certain acts have been passed
by the federal Governiment with relation ta
specific products.
In rny province of New Brunswick we passed in each case a sirnilar act and similar
regulations ta those passed by the federal
Governrnent. In that way there could be
no cause for misunderstanding or misconstruing of different standards in the enactments of the federal Governrnent and those
of the province. It was for that reason that
identicai regulations were passed.
I have reaiiy nathing ta say about the act
itseif. It daes, however, contain provisions

SENATE
which are quite far reaching. But the important point in my opinion is that the
producer of leaf tobacco now realizes that
it is necessary for him to improve his product
in order to satisfy the trade, because all
consumers today are quality conscious. It
is for that reason that he wants the act
extended to include leaf tobacco. As I say,
I understand every province has authority
to pass such legislation with respect to any
agricultural product consumed within the
province, but if it is to be sold in the interprovincial or export trade it is necessary to
have the product covered by the general
federal legislation.
I am quite prepared to go along with honourable senators who feel that this measure
should be referred to a committee, but I do
not think we should lose sight of the fact
that it is the producers themselves who want
to sell a better product. The consumers
also have asked for a better product, and
surely we ought to be in a position to help
them to get it.
It is true that the act has not been proclaimed, and that there may be certain
features of it which do not recommend proclamation, but we are not interfering with
the principle of the act. By the passage of
this amendment we shall only be including in
the act a product which the producers want
included. I am wholly prepared to support
the amendment.
Hon. Thomas Reid: Honourable senators,
may I say one word about this measure? I
remember well when the original bill was
before us many of us objected to the handing
over of the powers proposed by that bill.
Many of us felt that the request for the
legislation did not come entirely from the
growers of the products or the producers of
eggs, but from certain officials. The very
fact that the act has not been proclaimed
would lead me to believe that the growers,
or those affected, have not seriously asked
that the legislation be put in force. So far
as I know, no strong representations have
come from the growers or producers. We
have always had legislation providing for
inspection of eggs and poultry, but not with
the powers contained in this legislation. One
has to have the statute before him to realize
the full import of it.
For these reasons I am very glad that this
bill is to be referred to a committee. There
will be more questions asked at that time,
because I for one was not satisfied when the
original bill was before this bouse.
Motion agreed to and bill read second
time.

REFERRED TO COMMITTEE

Hon. Mr. Choquette: Honourable senators,
I move that the bill be referred to the Standing Committee on Natural Resources.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: May I ask the Leader
of the Government whether he would consider having the committee meet to consider
this bill ten days hence?
Hon. Mr. Aseline: I think it would be
better for the committee to meet tomorrow
and decide at that time how far it wants to
go. The committee could adjourn after its
meeting tomorrow to some later date and not
report the bill until it completed its investigation. In that way the public would have
notice of the fact that the committee was
meeting on this bill, and if any representations are to be made by the producers of the
product in question they could make arrangements to come and be heard.
For those reasons, I suggest the committee
should get started on its work tomorrow.
Motion agreed to.

Hon. W. M. Aseltine: Honourable senators,

Leader of the Opposition (Hon. Mr. Macdonald), the following motion standing in my
name:
I

That a Specia] committeo of the Senate bie
appointed to consider and report on land use in
Canada and what should bie dune to ensure that
our land resources are most effectively utilized for
the benefit of the Canadian economy and the
Canadian people and, in particular, to increase
both agricultural production and the incomes of
those engaged in it;
That the committee bie composed of the Honourable Senators Barbour, Basha, Bouchier, Bois,
Bradette, Camcrcn, Crerar, Emerson, Gladstone,
Golding. Hawkins, I-Trner, Ioman, T.eger. Leonard.
MacDoanald, McDonald, McGrand, Methot, Molson,

That the committee have power ta send for
persons. papers and records, to, sit during sittings
and adjourniments of the Senate, and to report
from lime to, time.
That the evidence taken on the subject during
the two preceding sessions bie referred to the
committee.

I do not intend to speak on this motion
today, but I sec that the honourable senator

from Gulf (Hon. Mr. Power), who was chairman of the committee during two sessions, is
here today, and I wonder if he would be

kind enough to give us some information as
to what has been done in the past, and what
the prospects are for carrying on and accomplishing some good work in the future.
Han. C. G. Power: Honourable senators,
I thank the honourable Leader of the Senate
for giving me an opportunity to make some
observations with respect to the comnmittee
on land use. I should like to preface my
remarks by saying that the study which this
committee has undertaken is peculiarly a
work which should be undertaken by this
honourable body. the Senate. It is a longrange study, in that we have perhaps reached
a stage in our Canadian economic development wherein we must begin to take somne
note of the natural resources which Providence has bestowed upon us and of the disappearance through our own negligence of
a large portion of these resources. We have
not, exccpt in some rare instances, reached
what I might caîl a state of emergency; but
it behooves us to be on guard if we do not
want to faîl into the samne condition as that
into which a great many other nations have
fallen, or if we do not even wish other
regions or sections of our country to go
through the exoerience such as has been
had right here in the Ottawa Valley, where
in order to swell the coffers of more or less
piratical lumbermen we have felled practically ail the pine forests. The samne condition exists, pcrhaps to not quite such a large
degree, on the south shore of the St.
Lawrence, where through îll-advised colonization we have denuded a large part of the
land xvhich should have remained under
forcst cover. and alloxved it to become
practically either mar.,inal farmland or farmland that can grow nothing exccpt the rocks
that nature placed there.
Now this Senate is peculiarly, as I said, a
body which should make the study of matters of this kind, and particularly this
matter of the conservation of our natural
resources. There is not much publicity value
in the work, and therefore it is perhaps more
fitting that those of us who have reached
the stage where publicity does not have the
value that it may have had when we were
in active politics should occupy oursolves
with this work. Also there is not much partisan advantaFce to be gained from the work
in one way or the other, so we can study these
questions with the equanimity, the serenity
and the decorum which is peculiarly fitted to
our body.
Further, we have also within our ranks
here persons who are well fitted to undertake
careful consideration of matters of this kind.
I was noticing this morning in the Coinmittee on Natural Resources, where we were
discussing an agricultural problem, that two

JUNE 12, 1958
of our members had been Ministers of Agriculture in their respective provinces, one for
a period of over twelve years. Sitting alongside me here is a gentleman who was Minister
of Agriculture in the dominion Government
many years ago (Hon. Mr. Crerar), and
who later on in the course of his very estimable and exemplary career served this country
as Minister of Mines and Natural Resources.
We have among us men who have taken part
in the development of waterpower, men who
are actually still carrying on farming activities at their own homes; we have others
who have been successful in the commercial
or industrial field and who are endeavouring,
without success, to carry on careers as gentlemen farmers. In other words, we have here,
in a manner which does not exist in any
other body in Canada, both the mental equipment for this kind of work and the manpower and womanpower capable of carrying
it to a successful conclusion.
Now, with respect to the subject itself:
It is so immense, so vast, covering the conservation of all natural resources, that it was
possible for the committee to cover only the
fringes of it. We heard witnesses, many of
them men dedicated to the ideal of conservation, men from federal and provincial
departments, persons connected with associations interested in a peculiar way, some in
agriculture, some in forestry and in husbandry
of various kinds. Perhaps, for information,
I might be permitted to place on Hansard a
list of the witnesses heard by the committee.

That is why I say we have in our work
Committee to visit this establishment at the
earliest possible date. Up to the present reached a phase where we must come down

JUNE 12, 1958
to specific steps, and I would urge the
members of the committee to give some
serious thought to this phase of the work
that is before them. I would also like to add
on my own behalf a word of warning and
perhaps advice that there are constitutional
as well as practical difficulties in the way
of carrying out what might be considered
specific recommendations. We should bear in
mind that in this study, or in any specific
study dealing with land, nearly all of what
we call our natural resources are, under
our Canadian constitution, a matter of provincial concern, and that the federal Government can rarely if ever take any action
without the consent and co-operation of and
consultation and association with the provinces. That is the first point I should like to
make clear to honourable senators.
The second is that a large part of the
lands which might be the subject-matter of
inquiry, improvement or, in some cases,
regulation, is privately owned and cannot or
should not be dealt with without the consent
of individual owners.
My third point is perhaps made out of
deference to some of my friends of the
Manchester school of thought, the light of
which still burns, though more like a flickering flame in this age of electric light. This
third point is that proposals leading to
forcible evacuation of persons or involuntary
control of land, in this country which by
tradition at least is dedicated to individual
freedom and protection of property rights,
are apt, and rightly so, to meet with serious
opposition. This last point deals with certain
proposals which were put before us in all
good faith and, I think, with a great deal
of public spirit and public support behind
them. They would have prevented owners of
some lands from disposing of them as they
desired because, according to the proposals,
it was desirable in the general interest of
the public that they remain as agricultural
lands or be formed into what are called
green belts or things of that kind.
The Niagara Peninsula, which is being invaded by industrial development, is one case
in point. There was another case where one
of our witnesses pointed out to us the danger
of the city of Montreal growing so rapidly
into the suburbs that some measure should be
taken to prevent lands now under cultivation
from passing into the hands of those who
wish to subdivide them into rural dwelling
places.
Before any committee makes recommendations which would run -counter to the views
of a great many people in this country, it
would be well to give serious consideration
to those views. That is the reason why I
have added, on my own responsibility, certain

suggestions or warnings with respect to the
making of recommendations by this Committee on Land Use.
Honourable senators, because of the vast
field of inquiry and because, as I have already
tried to stress, this Senate is peculiarly fitted
for this kind of work, I strongly endorse the
motion made by the honourable Leader of
the Government (Hon. Mr. Aseltine).
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: I thank the honourable
senator from Gulf (Hon. Mr. Power) for
giving us such a detailed and interesting
report on the work of the Special Committee
on Land Use, and also for his suggestions as
to what should be done in the future.
I might interject here that on the trip I
made to India last November I flew over a
large area of apparently barren land which
I was told had at one time been very fertile
country. From the eastern end of the Mediterranean Sea until we came to the Valley of
the Tigris and the Euphrates Rivers I could
see nothing but desert, with scarcely any
habitation of any kind. After we left that
valley, which is said to have narrowed greatly
over the years, until we reached the gulf, and
on to Karachi, it was again all desert land.
In my opinion, this inquiry into land use is
a very important work, and I hope the committee will give it full attention, because we
do not want anything like that to happen
in Canada. I frequently go into the province
of Quebec on fishing trips, and I could show
honourable senators thousands of acres of
land where not one tree has been left, land
on which practically everything has been cut
right down to the ground. The same thing
has happened, to almost the same extent, in
the Madawaska Valley of Ontario. I have
been up there several times, and I can tell
honourable senators that nothing is left in
the way of forest which could be made into
lumber for the building of houses and like
purposes; all one finds is some poplar or
small birch and other small growth. In my
opinion a great many areas in Quebec,
Ontario, Manitoba and Saskatchewan should
be reforested and the wasteland made
productive.
Honourable senators, that is all I wish to
say at the present time, but perhaps someone
else would like to speak on this subject. I
hope that the motion, which is seconded by
the Honourable the Leader of the Opposition
(Hon. Mr. Macdonald), will meet with the
full approval of the Senate.
Hon. W. Ross Macdonald: Honourable
senators, I join with the Leader of the Government (Hon. Mr. Aseltine) in presenting
this motion to the house, and I heartily endorse it. I listened with great interest to the

SPEECH FROM THE THRONE
MOTION FOR ADDRESS IN REPLYDEBATE CONTINUED

The Senate resumed from yesterday consideration of His Excellency the Governor
General's speech at the opening of the session,
and the motion of Hon. Mr. Monette, seconded
by Hon. Mr. Thorvaldson, for an Address in
reply thereto.
Hon. T. A. Crerar: Honourable senators,
what we call the Speech from the Throne

affords an opportunity for a very wide-ranging discussion of our public affairs. The
political landscape is almost illimitable in
its extent. The custom, or rather the practice,
of discussing the Speech from the Throne has
of course a far-reaching significance that goes
back a great many decades-even centuries,
when sovereigns had great authoritarian
power. Parliaments in those days insisted on
discussing grievances before they voted supply to the sovereign, and that, historically, is
the position that we are in today. Of course
customs and conditions have changed, but it
is well to keep within our established practice
this matter of discussing grievances, because
today there are occasional signs of a tendency
for centralization of power in the hands of
the executive. That is true not only here but
it is a common complaint in most parliamentary assemblies, and we have seen only
within recent days a rather striking illustration of the truth of what I have said in the
experience of that great old country of France.
The debate on the Address is a debate on
the Speech from the Throne. A few weeks
ago His Excellency presented to us a speech
-not that he had anything to do with writing
it or preparing it-that was put into his
hands by the Government of the day and
his expression, his reading of the speech to
Parliament was simply an indication of what
the program of the Government is to be for
the present session of Parliament. Now, to be
quite frank, and I am quite sure my colleagues in this house will not be surprised if
I am a bit frank, the Speech from the Throne
to me was a good deal of a disappointment
and that for reasons which I shall presently
endeavour to enumerate.
But if the Speech from the Throne was a
disappointment to me there was no disappointment in the excellent speeches of the
mover and the seconder of the motion to adopt
the Address. They distinguished themselves,
and I say that with full sincerity. Unfortunately, I could not follow the speech
of the mover (Hon. Mr. Monette), but I read
it and it was an excellent performance. The
junior senator from Winnipeg (Hon. Mr.
Thorvaldson), who seconded the address,
spoke with a confidence that I was delighted
to see and his contribution was a very worthwhile one. After all, this country is made up
of diverse elements. There is no part of our
Canadian population that has made any
greater contribution to our culture, industry
and the professions than the people to which
the honourable senator belongs.

I have a word of commendation to say
about my old colleague the honourable the
senior senator from Winnipeg (Hon. Mr.
Haig), who retired from the leadership. He
has served a long and distinguished career
in the public life of his country, first as a
school trustee in the city of Winnipeg, then
for many years as a member of the Legislative Assembly of that province, and in the
Senate since 1935. It is a long and honourable record, and one in which every honourable senator in this house can feel sorne
pride.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: Then I have a word to
say to the new senators. We wish all of

I for one hope
that our Canadian ministers will be able to
make a very considerable contribution to
the solution of these perplexing and difficult
world problems.
I turn to another facet of the Speech, and
I shall read it:
My Government believes that the condition of
international economic affairs is such as to require
major concerted efforts to encourage the expansion
of trade. It is accordingly very gratifying that all
countries of the Commonwealth have accepted the
proposal of Canada that a Commonwealth Trade
and Economie Conference be held in September of
this year in Montreal.

Hon. Mr. Roebuck: And peace.
Hon. Mr Crerar: I am bound to say that
J am not particularly hopeful of the outcome of this conference. I find myself wondering what will happen, should the British
Chancellor of the Exchequer, who will no
doubt head the British delegation, suggest to
our Government, "we are in full agreement

JUNE
with your hopes and ambitions in this
respect, and we suggest that the best method
of carrying it to fruition is that we reach
a condition of free trade between our two
countries within 10 years." That is going
to be a test for the Prime Minister and his
colleagues. How are they going to respond
to it?
Well, I will read another paragraph of
the Speech:
You will be asked to approve a number of
measures and appropriations to continue and extend the program of my Government in sustaining
employment by the acceleration of useful public
works and by encouraging the development and
processing of our natural resources.

Now, what does that mean? How does the
Government propose to encourage the development and processing-particularly the
processing-of our natural resources? How is
that to be carried out? When this conference
takes place in September in Montreal, is the
Prime Minister or his Minister of Finance
going to say to the British Government, "It
was a very fine proposal that you made to us,
but we want to process our own primary
rsources at home." How can that be done?
To my way of thinking there are only two
ways: either by subsidizing industry to produce
our materials at home, or by erecting a tariff
against the outside world, to enable home
industry to thrive under those conditions, and
let the Canadian people pay the shot. That is
a matter which I, at any rate, shall watch in
its developments with a great deal of interest.
The next point in the Speech to which I
wish to draw attention is the proposal to
enact a Bill of Rights to safeguard the rights
of all persons in Canada within the jurisdiction of this Parliament. Here again is an inconsistency. That was not the kind of talk in
which the Prime Minister engaged when he
was advocating in the House of Commonsand, I may say, with a large measure of support from myself-a Bill of Rights. The
measure he proposed was to be dominionwide in its application. There may have been
a question of how far its enactment was
within the constitutional powers of Parliament. It may be that the Prime Minister has
now concluded that that power does not
extend to the preservation of what are known
as civil rights within the provinces. But
before the Prime Minister on earlier occasions presented the views that he did to this
country he should have been certain of the
constitutional ground on which he stood. Personally I am favourable to a Bill of Rights,
but I realize that in this matter a large
measure of jurisdiction is under provincial
control, and in my judgment it will be necessary, in order to achieve this very desirable
end, to enlist public opinion in each province
individually. Quebec has been criticized for

its interference with certain constitutional
rights which the individual should have, but
Quebec is not singular in this respect. The
same situation, with varying circumstances,
has been found in some of the other provinces. And in any event, I repeat, if the very
desirable end in view is to be achieved it is
necessary to carry the public opinion of the
provinces in support of the federal authority.
We shall be asked-in a certain measure
we have already been asked-to make provision for a substantial program of
public investment to be carried out by Government departments and Crown companies and to
provide assistance to provincial Governments for
certain agreed types of projects.

All this is very general and, I am bound
to say, rather vague. We shall see what
will corne out of it.
In particular, a large expansion in the construction and equipment of our system of airports and
airways-

And so forth. There is no doubt, of course,
that some of our airfields need expansion.
The development of this modern technique
of transportation of people and goods by
air is bound to extend further.
But I would draw attention to another
statement in the speech.
My ministers remain mindful of the importance
of financing their large program of expenditures in
such manner as will best safeguard against a recurrence of inflationary dangers in future. They wish
to urge upon all groups in our society

I ask honourable senators to note this closely:
a recognition of the dangers and inequities of inflation and the need to restrain demands which
will give rise to increases in prices and the costs
of production.

Again, a very worthy pronouncement. But
the first thing that struck me in reading the
first part of this paragraph was the statement of mindfulness to "safeguard against
a recurrence of inflationary dangers in future". This implies that there was this danger in the past; and I strongly suspect that
when that part of the Speech was written
the author had in mind the conditions which
existed in this country about 14 or 15 months
ago, when there was a real danger of inflation. Today we find in the estimates supplied to Parliament-figures which will be
confirmed in the budget when it is presented
next Tuesday-the largest public spending
by a federal Government in our history, and
this at a time when there is a definite recession in Canada, with the probability that
the gross national product may fali as much
as $2 billion in volume below what it was
a year ago. That should be a matter of some
concern. Why does not the Government set
an enample? Honourable senators who have
been here for several years will recognize

Take another item. I may say to my honourable friend the junior senator from Winnipeg (Hon.

Mr. Thorvaldson)

that this is

one on which I offered some criticism during
past occasions when the old Government was
in power. Give or take a few thousands,

there are approximately 170,000 Indians and
Eskimos in Canada. Is there any honourable
senator here who knows what the Government proposes to spend in this fiscal year
for the care of these Indians and Eskimos?
You may be surprised when I tell you that
you will find the estimates amount to approximately $53,600,000, which is $6,200,000
over what it was a year ago, when the

Hon. Mr. Crerar: I am opposed to it mainly

on the ground that it is long before its time.
If the province of Saskatchewan had a population of 7 or 8 million people, or even 5 or
6 million people, then there might be a
sound argument for the construction of the
South Saskatchewan River Dam. But anyone who knows anything about the history
of irrigation in western Canada realizes that
it is impossible to utilize irrigation water
for the successful growth of cereal crops,
because the cost is prohibitive. It means
that the cereal industry in the area concerned would have to be subsidized in some
form or other, for it could not pay its way.

JUNE 12, 1958

When you have a locality where there is
increased population, such as in the Lethbridge district of Alberta, it might be practicable to build such a dam and utilize the
water for intensive agricultural production;
but I say that to go ahead with the South
Saskatchewan River Dam at the present time,
in the light of the financial situation that is
facing us, is entirely unwarranted.
Honourable senators, I come now to one
other point. I have already mentioned the
speeches of the Prime Minister, particularly
in the campaign of 1957, and I am charitable
enough to believe that when he delivered
those speeches he did not expect he would
soon have the responsibility of the administration of this country's affairs. Success came
to him, not because of the Harris budget, but
for other reasons which I am not going to
enumerate. However, I support what was
said so well in the admirable address given
by the honourable senator from Shelburne
(Hon. Mr. Robertson) a short time ago.
I want to say a word in defence of the
Harris budget, because in its essence it was
not only a sound but a courageous budget.
Often I felt 'the old administration lacked
courage to ta-ckle some problems effectively,
but it did not lack courage in the case of
that budget. I will endeavour to state briefly
why I hold that view. There is no doubt
that at that time, March of last year, there
was definite evidence of rising inflationary
pressures. That is not now denied. It is
almost indirectly referred to in the paragraph
I read a little while ago, when the Government was warning against a recurrence of
inflation. Now, what did Mr. Harris do? He
had a surplus. He budgeted for a surplus
of $152 million, and, if my memory serves
me, that was after appropriating $50 million
to strengthen the Public Service Superannuation Fund, which today is not actuarially
sound, and another $50 million as a reserve
against any possible liabilities. That was
sound, honest housekeeping. The inflationary
pressures were there. That is why Mr.
Harris did not reduce taxes; that was why
the so-called "tight money policy" was carried out. There was much nonsense talked
about the tight money policy. Our expansion
was at a rate that was threatening to plunge
the country ever deeper and deeper into inflation. I know my statement on that point
may be challenged, but from the evidence
it is crystal clear to me, at any rate.
In the face of that situation Mr. Harris
budgeted, not to reduce taxes, but for a
surplus. It was an austere budget, and a
courageous one. It would have been easy
for him to increase the old age pension to
$50 or $55 a month. He could have reduced

taxes, but he did not do it. And this, honourable senators, was with an election
certainly in prospect. When the right thing
is done I for one will applaud it. On that
occasion Mr. Harris did not bring down a
popular election budget. As a matter of
fact, it was twisted and distorted so that it
was made to appear as a very dangerous
budget, but while it may have helped defeat
the Liberal party it did a service to the
country. I shall give some proof of my
statement. The contrast between the Harris
policy and the policy followed by the present
Government is that Mr. Harris wanted to
conserve and protect the value of our money.
That is beyond question.
The present
Government may profess to want to do that,
but what has been the result of its spending
spree? Well, the cost of living index, which
measures the value of our dollar, is the best
gauge we have.
I pause here to say that few people realize
the inroads that inflation has made on the
savings of the people. For instance, this suit
I am wearing could have been purchased 18
years ago for half of its present price. The
price of a pair of shoes has more than
doubled in the same period. There has been
a steady erosion, a steady wearing away of
the value of savings in life insurance, investments, bonds, and deposits left with banks.
Can we continue this process, and in even
one year from now have a dollar that is
worth the same that it is today? As a matter
of fact, our dollar has depreciated more than
50 per cent in purchasing power in the last
20 years. Are we going to face further decreases in its purchasing power? That will
bring increasing hardship to all our people
who cannot protect themselves against this
grave danger.
If there is one thing that should have the
full consideration and preoccupation of the
present Government today, it is to maintain
the purchasing power of our dollar, to keep
our money at least as honest as it is now.
When Mr. Harris brought down his budget
a year ago the cost of living index, which,
as I have said, is the method of measuring
the value of the dollar, stood at 120.5. When
the present Government came into power last
June the cost of living index was 121.6. In
other words, the proposals of the Minister of
Finance of that day had not yet been in
operation long enough to show their full effect. Well, that policy was put into reverse by
the present administration, with the result
that less than a year later the cost of living
index has gone up almost steadily, and last
April it stood at 125.2. Within one year there
bas been a rise in the cost of living index
of about three and a half points. This bas
resulted in a decrease in the purchasing

SENATE
power of the dollar to the extent of three
and a half points. My honourable friends opposite may smile and think that this is not
very important, but where shall we stand a
year from now, or two or three years from
now? It has been predicted that when the
budget is brought down on Tuesday evening
it will show the largest deficit in the history
of this country. I venture to predict now that
unless the Government changes its program,
its deficit a year from now will be as great
as it is now. If there is one lesson that economists teach us, and experience as well, it is
that deficit financing is one of the sure roads
to inflation of the cost of living.
I think, and I say with all earnestness,
there is no problem facing this country today
more serious in its implications and its possibilities than this problem of inflation. I do
not wish to hold out warnings. Sometimes
the immediate past leader of the Government
in the Senate (Mr. Haig) used to issue warnings to the house. I do not like doing it, but
I would suggest that if the honourable the
Leader of the Government (Mr. Aseltine)
and his deskmate (Hon. Mr. Brunt), who is
a comparatively new member of the house,
have any influence with the powers that be,
they should use il to try to persuade them
on the importance of this matter to the people
of Canada.
I have talked too long, but I have just one
or two things more to say. I am among those
who believe that the surest way to expand
prosperity and happiness among our people
is by trading with the world and I think any
proposals or suggestions to put barriers in
the way of expanrion of our trade are unfortunate and ill advised. After all, 20 per cent
of our gross national product comes from
exports. Shut those off and where will we find
ourselves? There is no greater fallacy than
to think that we can switch a large segment
of our American trade to the British. If we
want to increase trade with Britain, and if
we wish to increase imports from Britain,
let us cut the tariffs off, accept the proposal
that was made by the Chancellor of the Exchequer last fall, then we shall have the sure
way of doing it. But, while hope springs
eternal in the human breast, I am bound to
say that I sec very little prospect of the
present administration doing that.
Of course, trade is of paramount importance to Canada, but there is another
matter that should be giving us some concern, and that is the economic development
of the Soviet state. I think we have been
entirely wrong in our estimate of the Russian
people. They are just as capable and as efficient in production, or will become as capable
and efficient in production, as is any industry
in this country or the United States.

Hon. Mr. Aseltine: I do not agree with that.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: The evidence we get in
increasing measure from Russia, from those
who have visited it, inspected its factories and
its industry, watched its people in their work,
is all to that effect. Already Russian aluminum
is invading the British market, underselling
Canadian aluminum. Already Russian lumber
products are invading our markets in Britain,
a fact which is of particular significance to
Nova Scotia and British Columbia.
It will only be a matter of time until Russia
enters the European market with metals and
grain, a market where in past years we have
sold a large part of our surpluses. What challenge does that bring to this country? That, I
submit, is something to which members of
both bouses of this Parliament should bc
giving some consideration. Otherwise we shall
flnd ourselves limited and restricted, our
trade cut down, and we shall face the rather
doubtful prospect of freezing on our own
iceberg.
On motion of

PRIVATE BILL
BURRARD INLET TUNNEL AND BRIDGE
COMPANY-SECOND READING

Hlon. Stanley S. McKeen moved the second
reading of Bill S-4 respecting The Burrard
Inlet Tunnel and Bridge Company.
lie said: Honourable senators, I would
like to give you just a little of the historv
behind this bill before dealing with the
proposed amendment.
The bridge is a very necessary adjunct to
the transportation facilities of Vancouver,
North Vancouver, West Vancouver and adjacent municipalities.
In 1910 the Burrard Inlet Tunnel and
Bridge Company was incorporated and given
authority to build a tunnel at the First Narrows, the shortest crossing, or a bridge at
the Second Narrows. Nothing was done until
1923. That year the company decided to
build a bridge at the Second Narrows, and
construction was carried on in 1923, 1924
and 1925. Then, authority to build a tunnel
at the First Narrows was withdrawn from
the act and the company's charter limited
it to the bridge. However, the word "Tunnel"
remained in the corporate name of the conpany, although it no longer had authority
to build a tunnel.
The bridge was opened on November 7,
1925. In order to overcome very strong opposition of shipping interests the authority that
was given for the building of the bridge
specified that it must be so designed as not
to be a menace to navigation. Well, the shipping interests said that owing to the way the

JUNE 12, 1958
bridge was constructed it would make navigation very difficult, as at flood tide ships
would be driven against the north side of
the bridge, and at ebb tide against the south
side. The accidents that followed proved this
was true. Captain Johnson, R.N.R., was
named chairman of a committee to see that
the fixed span was removed and replaced
by a vertical lift span in the proper position.
Some weeks later one of his barges got
caught under the fixed span, dumped it into
the water and effectively opened the span
that the shipping interests objected to. A
jocular statement was made in one of the
newspapers that he was going to be awarded
a leather medal for removing the span. As
a matter of fact, to this day some people in
North Vancouver think he did it purposely,
which of course is mere imagination.
After long litigation the bridge was declared
by the Privy Council to be a menace to
navigation, so a special act of Parliament
was passed legalizing the bridge. However,
the accident caused by the barge, which occurred in 1930, put the bridge company in
a rather difficult circumstance, because to
replace the span would cost a million
dollars and it did not have the money. The
municipalities, having guaranteed the bridge
company's bonds, became financially embarrassed as a result of this loss and were
facing bankruptcy. The Right Honourable
R. B. Bennett was Prime Minister at the
time, and the Government came to the assistance of the cities and the municipalities
by lending them a million dollars to replace
the span. The bridge was later taken over
by the National Harbours Board and operated
by it until 1951, when it had its money back,
and the bridge was turned back to the company at that time. It was then turned over
into the hands of a receiver for the bondholders, because the company was in arrears
with its bond obligations. At that stage the
company had a sinking fund of $88,000 and
was in arrears to the extent of several
hundred thousand dollars.
By very good management on the part of
the bridge company that position was reversed, and in the past year the company
paid a dividend of 40 per cent, amounting
to $321,000. It has paid back all its arrears,
and has put in the hands of the trustee just
less than $1 million to take care of the bonds
when they come due and to pay interest in
the meantime. So the company is now in
excellent condition. This condition has been
achieved under the management of the reeves
and councillors who were in charge of the
bridge operation.
The management consists of two directors
from the city of North Vancouver, the major
and an alderman, and two representatives

from the district of North Vancouver. Those
two municipalities own about 60 per cent
of the bridge. West Vancouver and the City
of Vancouver each has one representative.
One private individual bas 25 shares of stock
in the bridge company; how she got it, I do
not know, but when the bill goes to committee
we will find out.
This amendment would permit the shareholders of the bridge company to pay salaries
to the president and directors of the company. The proposed payments are very small,
being limited to $1,200 a year for the president and $500 for each director. These men,
who have the management of the bridge, are
going to have to devote considerable time to
that work. I may say, although the financial
picture now looks very good, there will be
stiff competition next year from a high-level
bridge now being built by the provincial Government alongside this bridge, as most likely
the bulk of traffic will go to the new bridge.
The bridge company will have to make a new
deal with the Canadian National Railways,
which use the bridge; at the present time
the railway controls the rail traffic and the
municipality controls the vehicular traffic.
The proposed amendment to pay salaries to
management is only permissive: it will give
the municipalities permission to pay these
sums, only if the shareholders-which are the
municipalities-so decide.
The company was formed to make a profit,
and it was expected it would pay a dividend. The municipalities now have all their
money back. The trustee for the bondholders
bas more than sufficient money to pay off the
bonds and interest and the bridge company
bas set aside $250,000 for any actual repairs
or replacements that might be needed. So,
financially the company is in very good shape.
If the bill is given second reading, I will
move that it be referred to the Standing
Committee on Transport and Communications.
Hon. Mr. Bruni: Would the honourable
senator permit a question? The amendment
would limit the payments to $500 each for the
directors and $1,200 for the president. If the
bridge company prospers, and if these men
have to devote more and more time to the
management of it, might the company not
have to come back to Parliament later and
ask for an increase in compensation? I am
wondering why the bill does not stipulate
larger amounts.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Why limit them?
Hon. Mr. McKeen: The fact of the matter
is that this request is being made by the
bridge company, which in effect means the
municipalities, and I presume they have decided on the amount they wish to pay. I
should perhaps say that if these men are

HOSPITAL INSURANCE AND DIAGNOSTIC
SERVICES BILL
PIRST READING

The Hon. the Speaker informed the Senate
that a message had been received from the
Hause of Commons with Bill C-30, to amend
the Hospital Insurance and Diagnostic Services Act.
Bill read first time.
SECOND READING
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators,
when shall this bill be read the second tim-e?
Hon. W. M. Aseltine: Honourable senators,
I arn informed that this bill is more or less
urgent on accaunt of the fact that payments
under it commence to be made on July 1
next. Therefore it is very advisable that it
should be considered by this chamber as expeclitiously as possible, so that when it has
received third reading it can be given the
royal assent, on Thursday evening, or at the
latest on Friday of this week. I would therefore urge that I be given permission to proceed with second reading of the bill now.
Some Hon. Senalors: Agreed.
Hon. William R. Bruni: Honourable senators, with leave I move second reading
of this bill.
Hon. T. A. Crerar: Honourable senators,
the last thing on earth that I should wisb
to do is to stand in the way of the second
reading, moved by our honourable colleague
from Hanover (Hon. Mr. Brunt), but there
is a littie bit more involved. It appears to
me it is more than merely accepting the plea
of the honourabie Leader of the Government
in the Senate (Hon. Mr. Aseltine), much as
I esteem, him.
This is the third occasion this session when
we have been presented with a bill with
the plea that it is of great urgency and must
be put through as quickly as possible. I cannot recali that under the previous administration we were asked to give first and second
readings at the same sitting ta any measure
other than an interim supply bill. The
practice, honourable senators, is wrong. We

can easily drift into a slipshod metbod of
dealing with legisiation in this bouse. If
the Government attaches so much importance
to this legisiation, and if it wants ta get
it through Parliament sa that it can enter
into contracts with the provinces on July 1,
why did it not have the measure before us
two weeks ago, or even three weeks ago?
Hon. Mr. Bruni: It was not tbrough the
other place.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: It is the business of the
Government to get its legishation thraugh
the other bouse. Tbis measure was not held
Up in tbe other bouse; tbe delay was in bringing it forward.
I wish ta make an emphatic protest, honourable senators, against this method o! dealing with legisiation.
This bill should be
allowed to stand on our records until
tomorrow at least, so, that we may bave a
chance to study the Hospital Insurance and
Diagnostic Services Act and the effect these
amend.n-ents may bave upon it. I do nat know
bow many honourable senators are familiar
with this act, whicb was passed a year ago,
but quite obviously if these amendments are
ta be considered intelligently we must study
them in relation to the act. Now we receive
the proposed amendments tonight for the
first time, and we are asked to pass them in
time for them to receive the royal assent on
Thursday next.
As far as I amn concerned, honourable
senators, I protest against this metbod of
procedure.
Hon. Mr. Vien: Honourable senators, I rise
to a point of order. If there is nat; unanimous
consent-and it is evident there is not-the
motion for second reading is out of order.
The Hon. the Speaker: The motion is not
out o! order, but without unanimous consent
o! the bouse second reading cannot be given
tonight; it could not take place before tomorraw afternoon.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: Good!
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Honourable senators,
the difficulty is tbat the senator who was ta
bave explained the bill (Han. Mr. Brunt)
cannot be here tomorrow.
Hon. Mr. Bruni: Honourable senators, I
will have anather senator take my place. I
would not want my absence used as a reasan
that the bill shauld not go aver for second
reading tomorrow.
Hon. W. Ross Macdonald: Honourable
senators, as far as I arn cancerned, I arn not;
going ta do anything that would in any way
interfere with putting into farce the amendments contained in this bill by July 1. At
least one province is prepared ta put hospital

and it has flot received royal assent, the
citizens of that province will be deprived of
the benefits under the bill.
Hon. Mr. Farris: Wby flot let it stand until
tomorroxv?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: There is ne reason
why, as the honourable senator from Vancouver South (Hon. Mr. Farris) has said, it
could not go over until tomorrow, and also
become law by July 1. But I certainly urge
ail bonourable senators to support any procedure which will bring the bill into effect
before the first of July. Perhaps, as the
honourable senator f rom Hanover (Hon. Mr.
Brunt) will not be here tomorrow, there
would be no objection to his making his
statement tonigbt. and then the bonourablo
senator from Churchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar)
or sorne otber honourable senator can move
adjournmont of the debate. Personally I see
no objection to that. The bill would net
receive its second reading tonight, but the
explanatory statement would be on the
record, and we would have time to study it
and the bill. That is the suggestion I would
make.

Some Hon. Senators: Yes.
Hon. Mr. Vien: I cannot see any urgency
about it. The bill provides that under the

of the bill provides as follows:
No contributions shall be paid under this act to

So far as I can see, there is no particular
urgency about passage of this bill. The rights

tion to those provinces is in force.

In

At the present time six such provinces
have not entered into an agreement, so in
those circumstances no contributions can be
paid, but the amendment proposed in clause
2 of the bill would permit payment of contributions to a participating province as of
July 1, whether or not at least six provinces,
containing not less than half the population
of Canada, have entered into an agreement
with the federal Government. In other
words, if this amendment passes the plan

1. But unless this amendment carries, the

pelled to provide certain stated in-patient
services, while the providing of what is
known as out-patient hospital services was
made an optional teature of the original act.
Among the statutory requirements of the
Hospital Insurance and Diagnostic Services
Act are provisions which require that the
province make insured services available to
all residents of the provinces upon uniform
terms and conditions; in other words, every
citizen of the province is treated in the same
way. Secondly, the province is required to
make arrangements necessary to ensure that

order to participate, provinces are com-

SENATE
adequate standards are maintained in all
hospitals; thirdly to maintain adequate records
and accounts; and, finally, to make provision
for the recovery of costs in those cases where
third party liability arises.
Honourable senators, a short word of explanation might be in order with respect to
third party liability. If a person, a pedestrian
for instance, through no fault of his own,
was hit by a motor car, severely injured,
placed in a hospital, and provided with hospital services, then the provincial legislation
must make provision for the province to
recover the cost of the hospital services provided to such a pedestrian from the offending
motorist.
The act also requires that the province
make certain specified in-patient services
available as insured services.
In-patient
services, roughly, are those services that are
provided to a person while he is a patient
within the hospital. As the minimum, the
in-patient services include the following: accommodation and meals at the standard or
public ward level; the necessary nursing
service; laboratory, radiological and other
diagnostic procedures, together with the
necessary interpretations for the purpose of
maintaining health, preventing disease, and
assisting in the diagnosis and treatment of
any injury, illness or disability; the providing
of drugs, the use of operating rooms, case
rooms, and anaesthetic facilities, including
necessary equipment and supplies; the providing of routine surgical supplies; the use
of radiotherapy facilities, where the same
are available in any hospital; and, finally,
the use of physiotherapy facilities, where
those facilities are available in any hospital.
All these requirements must be fully met by
every province wishing to conclude an agreement with the federal Government in accordance with the terms of the original act as
passed in April 1957.
In addition to these statutory requirements
under the act, the provinces are allowed to
provide a fairly wide range of optional
services. In addition to in-patient services
over and above those already mentioned,
out-patient services, including diagnostic and
laboratory services, may be included in the
program. Since these are optional, however,
one may find that the scope of provincial
insurance programs may differ widely. Basically the agreements themselves are the same
for all provinces. However, the schedules to
the agreements which contain the description of the scope of the provincial programs
and the methods of administration obviously
differ. The federal Government is required
to make contributions to the province amounting to approximately 50 per cent of the cost

of insured services incurred by the province
pursuant to the provincial act. The formula
under which the annual contribution is made,
as provided in the act, is intended to provide
a higher percentage to the less economically advanced provinces.
Honourable senators, I am going to be
quite frank and admit that I cannot explain
how the formula works, but if any honourable senator wishes that information we can
bring the appropriate officials over from the
Department of National Health and Welfare
to furnish it. The entire federal contribution
will, of course, be paid out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund. The provinces are free
to raise their share of the cost in any manner
which they deem advisable. In effect, the
provinces will be raising the necessary revenue through provincial taxation and/or
through a method of premium payments by
the participants. In the province of Ontario
both methods will be used: a certain part or
percentage of the provincial share of the
cost of this hospitalization will be provided
through taxation, and the remainder of the
cost of the provincial share will be provided
by the participants themselves making
monthly payments to a fund that the provinc'al Government has set up for this particular purpose.
No specified period of residence may be
required as a condition precedent to the
establishment of residence in a province. The
limitation on the definition of "residents of
a province" is contained in section 8, (1)a) of
the Hospital Insurance and Diagnostic Services Act. However, to really find the meaning
of "residents of a province" reference should
be made to the Regulations, wherein it is
stated:
-"residents of a province" means persons legally
entitled to remain in Canada who make their home
and are ordinarily present in that province, but
does not include tourists, transients or visitors to
the province.

Hon. Mr. Reid: What about immigrants?
Hon. Mr. Bruni: Well, if the immigrant is
in Ontario for one day and intends to become
a resident he is a resident of the province
of Ontario.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: There is nothing in
this amendment to that effect.
Hon. Mr. Bruni: No. I am dealing with the
original act. I thought that I should make a
rather extensive statement on the terms of
the criginal act, in view of what has been
said here earlier this evening.
Hon. Mr. Vien: Do I understand that only
residents of the province can benefit under

Hon. Mr. Bruni:
agreement is before the Government at the
present time, and it is anticipated it will
be signed before July 1 of this year and
that the program will commence on that
date.
Saskatchewan: a similar agreement is before the Government, and it is anticipated
that it will be signed before July 1 of this
year and that the hospitalization program
will commence to operate on that date.
The same applies to Alberta.
With respect to Nova Sceotia and New
Brunswick, these provinces are now formulating provincial plans, and it is proposed that
their provincial programs will commence on
January 1, 1959.
Prince Edward Island has declared its intention to participate in the program, and
it is anticipated that the provincial program
may be inaugurated in that province some
time during 1959.
Quebec has not indicated its intention with
respect to the hospital insurance program,
and therefore I cannot make any statement
as te when a hospitalization scheme may be
inaugurated in this province.
In addition to the amendment with regard
to the commencement of contributions, two
additional changes to the act are proposed.
These relate to in-patient services so far as
drugs, biologicals and related preparations
are concerned, and to the definition of "outpatient services".
It is deemed advisable that the legislation
should clearly state that drugs, biologicals
and related preparations as referred to in
the various agreements are insured services
It is
when administered in hospital only.
obvious that if drugs were made available
on a take-home basis the control of expenditure would be very difficult; and this matter
of control is as important to the provinces
as to the federal Government, since both
contribute to the cost of the scheme.
With regard to the amendment concerning
out-patient services-those are the services
provided to a person who goes to the
hospital, is treated and comes home; he
does not go into a room, does not necessarily
occupy a bed, and is not a boarder, so to
speak, in the hospital-it is proposed to
provide such a person with drugs, biologicals
and related preparations, together with
meals while the patient is in the out-patient
department or branch of hospital. No provision was made for this in the original act.
Under the proposed legislation, if a patient
goes into an out-patient department at 8
o'clock in the morning-and he may have to
to stay all day to receive his treatmenthe will be treated with the necessary drugs,

he will be provided with board and lodging
for that day, and will return home in the
evening.
Hon. Mr. Molson: Will my honourable
friend permit a question? Is it not felt that
the matter of providing meals in an outpatient department might lead to any number of abuses? It would seem to me it would
offer a great opportunity to take part of
one's insurance out in board.
Hon. Mr. Bruni: No. It is felt it will
eliminate a very serious abuse, namely, that
a patient becomes an in-patient in hospital
when it is not necessary. There cannot be
any abuse under this proposal, because in
order to qualify as an out-patient a person
must be treated by a doctor, and a doctor
is not going to keep one in hospital all day
and treat him unless it is necessary.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Can the honourable
senator tell me if these amendments have
been approved by the provinces? Has there
been any consultation with the provinces?
Has there been, for instance, a federalprovincial conference with respect to the
matter?
Hon. Mr. Bruni: I must say I am unable
to-yes! I must apologize, honourable senators, for being a little slow with my answer.
I have a very good coach in the gallery,
and I am advised that there have been
conferences and that agreement has been
reached in each case.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Can the honourable
senator tell us the nature of the conferences,
and who were present?
Hon. Mr. Bruni: No, I cannot, but I think
we can get the appropriate official from the
Department of National Health and Welfare
to inform us.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Get him now; he is up
in the gallery.
Hon. Mr. Bruni: As far as meals and
accommodation are concerned, the advisability of these services on an out-patient
basis will, we hope, tend to deter and cut
down on the number of admissions to
hospitals. In other words, it is hoped that
this amendment will have the effect of
keeping the ordinary out-patients from becoming in-patients of the hospital and thus
making beds more readily available for
people who are really ill. Therefore, it is
considered that by expanding the out-patient
services in this manner the extent of inpatient services can be reduced.
Honourable senators, from what I have
stated I think it can be clearly seen that a
majority of the provinces are prepared te

SENATE
Hon. Mr. Bruni: If the honourable senator
will look at the interpretation section of the
act he will find that the services which are
provided to patients in hospitals are clearly
set out, and it is only on that basis that the
dominion Government will make its contributions. The services are defined in the act.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: I see. Offhand, I should
think that the honourable senator's explanation covers the point.
I have only one or two suggestions.
Section 9 of the act provides that:
The minister shal, as soon as possible, after
the termination of each fiscal year, submit a report
to Parliament respecting the operation for that
year of the agreements made under this act and
the payments made to the provinces under each
of the agreements.
What may be a rather superficial reading
of the legislation indicates that the agreements
between the federal Government and each
of the provincial Governments to which it will
give rise will be of substantial importance,
and that the regulations also will play an
important part in the matter. My suggestion,
to which I hope my honourable friend will
give consideration-and perhaps he can consult others who are higher up; for, high as
he is, there are others even more eminent
than he-that an amendment be added to
section 9 to provide that, as is frequently
donc in respect of legislation of this kind,
the regulations will be tabled with the reports. I do not think it is unreasonable to
ask that Parliament shall be informed of the
regulations passed by the federal authority
with relation to administration
of this
legislation.
The only other matter which I had a note
to mention relates to the point raised by the
honourable senator from New Westminster
My experience and ob(Hon. Mr. Reid).
servation over a good many years have led
me pretty well to the conclusion that the
original estimates of the costs of legislation
of this kind are almost always exceeded.
Therefore I would ask that the officials who
corne before the committee shall be prepared
to present in detail the basis upon which they
calculate the amount of the federal Government's contribution. I think that is important. After all, if we had been able to
live within the prognostications when much
legislation of this kind was passed by Parliament we could have reduced our taxes by
probably a quarter of a billion dollars a year.
When Government officials tell us that the
federal cost will be thus and so, I for one
would like to have full confidence that they
know what they are talking about. I have
no objection whatever to the bill going to
committee as soon as possible.

Hon. Mr. Bruni: It cannot be referred to
committee unless we give it second reading.
Hon. Mr. McKeen: The bill has been explained and has been pretty well discussed,
and I would suggest that it be given second
reading now and sent to committee.

Hon. Mr. Aselline: Honourable senators, I
therefore move, seconded by the Honourable
Senator Haig:
That it is expedient that the Houses of Parliament
do approve an exchange of notes constituting an
Agreement between the Government of Canada
and the Government of the United States of
America concerning the Organization and Operation
of the North American Air Defence Command
(NORAD) signed at Washington, 12th May, 1958, and
that this house do approve the same.

Honourable senators, I do not pretend to
be an expert on foreign affairs, but I will
explain the North American Air Defence
Command Agreement, commonly known as
NORAD, to the best of my ability. Honourable
senators will remember that this agreement
was tabled in this chamber about four weeks
ago, and in order to enable honourable members to study it at their leisure the whole
agreement was printed as an appendix to the
Debates of the Senate and the Minutes of the
Proceedings of May 22. I also draw attention

to fear from an attack by air from the north.
In fact, in my opinion, we are in danger of
being attacked also from the Pacific and from
the Atlantic by nuclear weapons discharged
from submarines, and therefore we should
be ready for that possibility, and I believe
this agreement is a step in the right direction.
Honourable senators will no doubt agree
with me that Canada alone does not have
the necessary air power, manpower, and
other resources to defend its extensive territories in the event of any such attack as
I have mentioned. The United States has
these resources in abundance, and therefore
it seems to me that an agreement such as
NORAD is necessary with respect to our
joint defences. We need the help of the
United States, and they also need our assistance.
To accomplish this end mutual
sacrifices are most necessary. Accordingly,
NORAD is a very important agreement, and
our survival may well depend on it. Moreover, honourable senators, our relations with
Soviet Russia have not improved in recent
times. As witness to this we have the recent
unsatisfactory, evasive replies to our own
Prime Minister, which, in my opinion, make
an agreement like NORAD more vitally important than ever. We have also in mind
the executions which took place in Hungary
recently, going to show that there has been
no change since Stalin's death. In fact,
in my opinion, matters are going from bad
to worse.
The honourable senator from Churchill
(Hon. Mr. Crerar), in his remarks the other
day, to which I listened with great attention,
stated that an economic contest is looming up
with Soviet Russia, and he may be correct
in what he said on that occasion. No doubt
we shall have to defend ourselves against that
kind of attack, but let us not be led astray
by the economic threat and neglect our other
defences against a military attack to which
Canada and the North American continent as
a whole would be most vulnerable. NATO,
in my opinion, is still necessary. NORAD, as
an adjunct to NATO, is now more necessary
than ever, and I feel sure that this chamber
will endorse it by giving the agreement its
wholehearted support and approval.
With these introductory remarks, honourable senators, I now come to the NORAD
Agreement itself which, as already stated,
deals with a further measure to be taken
by Canada and the United States of America
in providing for their mutual defence. First,
however, I want to give honourable senators
the historical background leading up to the
agreement.
The defence co-operation between Canada
and the United States of America had its
origin in what is known as the Ogdensburg
57075-4-131

Agreement of August 1940, when a declaration was made by the President of the United
States and the Prime Minister of Canada
regarding the desirability of defence collaboration between the United States and Canada.
As all honourable senators are no doubt
aware, this arrangement was very effective
during the last world war in the political,
military and supply fields.
In November 1945 the United States Government forwarded a request to the Canadian
Government urging that collaboration in defence, which was so effective throughout the
last war, should be continued and that Canada
and the United States should agree to the
continuance of the Joint Board on Defence
and set up military arrangements to ensure
the close co-operation of the defence forces
of both countries in the defence of Canada
and the United States of America. As a result
of this approach, it was agreed that the Joint
Board on Defence would be continued and
that a military co-operation committee would
be set up directly responsible to the Chiefs
of Staff of each country to discuss and formulate joint measures for the defence of
Canada and the United States.
This agreement, honourable senators, was
finalized by a joint statement of both countries, and Parliament was informed of it on
February 12, 1947. Therefore it can be said
that defence co-operation and collaboration
existed between Canada and the United States
without a break and with continued impetus
since 1940.
I would like to say further that in April
1949, when Canada and the United States
signed the NATO Agreement, the arrangements and procedures for defence collaboration were continued under the Canada-United
States regional group as one of the regional
groups of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. I also want to say this, that collaboration in air defence was undertaken soon after
the close of the last war, and a joint effort
was made to develop a comprehensive air
defence system for the common defence of
North America.
This system comprises an aircraft control
and warning radar installation in the southern part of Canada known as the Pinetree
System, which was jointly built and is jointly
operated by Canada and the United States.
This was followed in 1953 by joint agreements for the construction of the Mid-Canada
Line and the Distant Early Warning Line and
a common communication system. For administrative convenience these projects were
constructed separately by each of the Governments mentioned but they are operated
along with the Pinetree Chain as a complete
early warning and interceptor system.

SENATE
In order to work out these intricate air
defence problems of an operational and
scientific nature a joint Canada-United States
study group consisting of service officers and
scientists was set up in 1955.
I mentioned a moment ago that we have
been co-operating with the United States
in developing an air defence system, and
much has been achieved on this basis of
co-operation on an informal level. However,
the high speed of moder aircraft, which now
travel at tice the speed of sound, and the
ranges of air defence weapons, which have
been extended to over 200 miles, require
rapid decisions whieh could not always be
accomplished under our previous arrangements which required consultation of national
commanders. The previous arrangements did
not, therefore, provide authoritative control
of all the weapons which could be profitably
employed against any hostile attacks which
might be made on North America. It was
clear that the whole air defence system must
be planned and operated as one single inUnder our previous artegrated system.

changed by one country without reference
to the other, although one nation's plans are
dependent upon those of the other. For these
reasons there has been a growing recognition in both countries of the need for a more
complete integration of planning and operational functions of air defence.
One of the lessons which came out of the
last war was that in conducting joint operations in war the commanders concerned must
have complete confidence in one another.
This requires them to work together in
peacetime to establish that confidence which
is necessary and desirable, and to practise
with the same set-up that they intend to
use or will have to use in time of war.
These deficiencies in our mnost vital defonen
arrangements were apparent to the Chiefs
of Staff of both countries. Therefore on May
14, 1956 the Canadian and United States
Chiefs of Staff agreed to direct the CanadaUnited States Joint Study Group to study
ways and means to integrate operational
control of the continental air defence forces
of Canada and the United States, and to
bring down recommendations for the implementation of such a plan, including a joint
headquarters.

arrangements were completed in March 1957
for consideration of these proposals at the
Government level, but as Parliament was
dissolved early in March it was not possible
to complete consideration of this arrangement.
In early July this proposal was placed
before the Government for consideration, and
agreement was reached for an interim arrangement for the establishment of a joint
headquarters and for the implementation of
a system of operational control for the air
defence forces of Canada and the United
States, pending the negotiation of terms of
reference for the joint headquarters and
negotiation of a governmental agreement.
On August 1 a joint statement was issued
by the Minister of National Defence for
Canada and the Secretary of Defence of the
United States. This joint statement agreed
in principle to the setting up of a system of
integrated operational control and the establishment of an integrated headquarters for
working out plans and procedures in peacetime to be ready for immediate use in an
emergency. It was essential to secure agreement in principle between the two countries

for me to say with respect to this resolution,
in the light of the very excellent statement
which bas been made by the honourable
Leader of the Government (Hon. Mr. Aseltine). There are a number of aspects of this
subject upon which I would like to speak at a

for me to do now is to move the reference of
this very critical and important agreement to
the committee for consideration, for enlightenment, and the acquisition of such information
as it is permissible to obtain.
Motion agreed to.
PROCEDURE

Hon. Mr. Roebuck: May I suggest that the
proceedings of that committee be reported?
A number of us who will be unable to attend
would like to be able to read a record of
the proceedings.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: I do not know to what
extent considerations of secrecy may be involved. I think it would be well to wait
until the committee assembles.
Hon. Mr. Croll: If secrecy in any respect
is involved, the person who is giving evidence
will simply say that, for reasons of security,

he cannot answer. That is the normal procedure. In that event there will be nothing to
take down.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: I would ask the bonourable senator from Ottawa (Hon. Mr.
Lambert) if it will be possible to have a meeting of the committee on Thursday morning at
10.30.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: I am quite in agreement
with that suggestion. I think it would be
very desirable to have the meeting as soon
as possible.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: I understand that the
witnesses will be available at that time.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: Another committee bas
already been called to meet on Thursday
morning, but I believe it will be possible to
have the meeting of the External Relations
Committee that morning, with ample time to
inquire into such questions as may arise. So
far as stenographic recording is concerned,
that matter is attended to by the Chief Clerk
of Committees, and he will be asked to make
the necessary arrangements.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Honourable senators,
may I ask a question concerning procedure?
We are doing two things: first, we are
adjourning the debate on the resolution of the

honourable Leader of the House (Hon. Mr.
Aseltine); second, we are referring the material of that resolution to the Standing Committee on External Relations for consideration
and report. I suppose that, under these circumstances, resolution No. 2, the resolution
standing in the naine of the Leader, will
have to be held over until the committee has
reported on the agreement referred to it
under resolution No. 1.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: That is so.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: I do not think that is
the way it is.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I would think that

resolution. However, it seems to me most
advisable that a final decision concerning it
should await the report of the External Affairs Committee. A bill, of course, after it

before us, although the procedure which is
being adopted is a little unusual-the bouse
having unanimously passed the resolution
moved by the honourable senator from Ottawa
(Hon. Mr. Lambert)-I see no reason whvy
the motion of the honourable Leader of the
house should not be transferred to the orders
of the day.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: Honourable senators,
may I suggest that in view of the disposition
of this subject, the agreement having been
referred to the Standing Committee on External Relations, the resolution which is on
the Order Paper in my name now automatically disappears.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: That is right.
Hon. Mr. Lamberi: And the resolution that
the honourable Leader of the Government
(Hon. Mr. Aseltine) has presented tonight
on this agreement which has been referred
to the Committee on External Relations will

that committee.
The whole procedure here is for the purpose
of ratifying this agreement just as it was
ratified in the other bouse.
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): Honourable senators, I worider whether this suggestion might help? I make it out of the top
of my head, if I may say so. I wonder if the

JUNE 24, 1958
honourable senior senator from Ottawa (Hon.
Mr. Lambert) might allow his motion to be
dropped in view of the fact that the honourable Leader of the Government in the Senate
has suggested that this agreement will be
referred to the Standing Committee on External Relations?

Hon. Mr. Macdonald: The honourable the
senior senator from Ottawa (Hon. Mr. Lambert) has already suggested that his motion
would now be dropped.

M.P., for the information of Parliament in
connection with the budget of 1958-59. These
Budget Papers were tabled in the House of
Commons and were stated to be for the
information of Parliament. Now, as the Senate
is a very important-if not the most important-section of Parliament, I would suggest
that these Budget Papers be tabled in this
house and I would ask the Leader of the
Government if this can be done.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: I do not think there is
any objection to that being done, if my
honourable friend the leader opposite (Hon.
Mr. Macdonald) wants it.
Hon. Mr. Croll: It would be in order foi
somebody to move that this be done. The
Leader of the Government has no authority
to do it. There needs to be a motion if they
are to be inserted in Hansard.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I am asking not that
they be inserted in Hansard, but just tabled
in the Senate.

Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): I am
sorry.

DIVORCE

Hon. Mr. Aseltine: I cannot amend my
motion. I have to leave it in the same form
as it appeared in the other house.
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Otlawa Wes±): I am
not suggesting that the honourable Leader
of the Government should amend his motion.
He has already said he thought it would be
an appropriate procedure to refer the subjectmatter of his motion to the Committee on
External Relations.

houses of Parliament: I am very grateful
for the invitation which has been extended
to me to address the Canadian Parliament. I
have spent 34 years of my life listening to
speeches in the House of Commons. I therefore know what a high compliment it is for
parliamentarians to add voluntarily to the
burdens they may have to undertake.
I remember very well sitting in the gallery
of the House of Commons in Canada in
Ottawa nearly 40 years ago. At that time I
was a young member of the Governor General's staff, which I joined shortly after the
end of the First World War. I recall in
particular the leading figures on both sides.
Mr. Meighen, happily still with us, was on
one side, and on the other was Mr. Mackenzie King. Those were the heroic days of
parliamentary debate. Being already attracted to politics, I used to spend many
hours listening to these classical masters
of oratory. If I remember right the fashion
of that day was that speakers were not only
very polished but sometimes--dare I say itsomewhat prolix.
I listened to your proceedings as a young
man, and now in revisiting your Parliament
after this great lapse of time I am reminded
of a story of Sir Winston Churchill who is
still, I am happy to say, an active member
of the British House of Commons. On a visit
to America and Canada in the middle of the
last war he was persuaded somewhat against
his will, for he was much pressed for time,
to go to Niagara Falls, which he had not seen
for 40 years. When asked what he thought
about it he made this observation, "Well,
the principle of the thing seems much the
same." So, if I may say so, it is with your
Parliament.
I lived a year in Canada, and I had the
good fortune to travel over the greater part
of the country. In fact, I think I have visited
perhaps more places from coast to coast than
have many Canadians. I took away from
Canada the most happy memories. I made
many friendships which have lasted through
the years. I also took back two precious
gifts: first, the return of my health-for I
was a cripple from war wounds when I
came here; and second-a gift to which you
have made kind allusion, Mr. Prime Minister
-a wife. I am glad to say that I have contrived, in spite of the ups and downs of life,
to preserve both these blessings.
The last time I was in Ottawa was in
November of last year. I had already had
the good fortune, Mr. Prime Minister, to
make a friendship with you in the summer
previous when you came post-haste from a
general election to the Commonwealth Prime
Ministers' Conference. I shall always admire
the way in which you arrived almost at a
day's notice. Nor can I forget that at that
conference by your inspiration and persistence
57075-4-14

there were sown the seeds of the Commonwealth Trade and Economic Conference to
which we are looking forward with such
high hopes. The first stage took place within
a few months at Mont Tremblant last year.
For the second, the preparatory work of
experts and officials is now proceeding. I
earnestly hope that the conference will mark
a great advance in commonwealth co-operation in trade and commerce.
When I saw the Prime Minister and the
cabinet seven months ago we had full and
frank discussions; but if I remember right
it was a position of some political uncertainty. Since then you have had another
election and you, Mr. Prime Minister, have
the satisfaction of being now supported by
a large majority in the house.
Perhaps you will allow me without impertinence to make some reflections upon the
ups and downs of politics. You have had
them in this country, and we have had them
in ours. Great successes are very agreeable
when they come, and defeats are correspondingly disappointing; but both victory
and defeat are in our democratic system part
of the game. We learn to accept them
cheerfully and look forward to the next
time. We recognize that the rights of minorities must be respected as well as the powers
of majorities, and perhaps this is the special
strength of our tradition and our democratic
system. It is based on, and indeed it can
only be preserved by, good humour, common
sense and fair play.
This leads me to venture some observations about the commonwealth as a whole.
I have had in the last few months a most
wonderful experience. I made a tour, much
too rapid to be satisfactory but comprehensive

enough to be inspiring, of five commonwealth
countries in as many weeks. All of them
have their problems-India, Pakistan, Ceylon,
Australia, New Zealand. I hope I may be
allowed some day to make not only these
occasional visits to the capital of Canada,
but a more prolonged visit to other parts
of the country. This tour which I made in
January made me realize more deeply what
I had already known but perhaps had not
fully comprehended, the immense force for
good which the commonwealth is and can
be in the world today.
What is it that binds us together? The
United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, New
Zealand, South Africa-we are, of course,
held together by common origins and tradition.
We feel a deep and personal loyalty to the
Crown, perhaps never more than today. We
are fortunate indeed to have in our Queen
so noble a representative of the royal function. But there are many countries of the
commonwealth which do not share common
origins or common allegiance. We are not,
all of us, bound together by ties of race,

SENATE
colour or religion. In these countries of Asia
and Africa even the Crown itself, so dear to
you and to us, is respected more as a symbol
of commonwealth unity than as a real and
personal object of loyalty.
What, then, is this spirit that breathes
upon this unique community of nations? It
is, I think, closely connected with what I
was trying to say just now about our parliamentary system and how we work it. It is
the idea of free government, freedom of the
law, of law and government separated, the
judiciary uncontrolled by legislature or executive. It is the belief in government by
consent, by debate, by committee, by local
authority, by parliament. Above all, perhaps
it is the conviction that the state was made
for man and not man for the state. People
who believe in these ideals will never surrender to materialism or to tyranny.
Of course the new nations of Asia and
Africa have many problems and difficulties,
but I have been deeply impressed with the
deep impact which our people and our institutions have had upon these peoples of the
East. I am quite sure of this; we do not gain
in their estimation by denigrating the very
real contributions which we have made. I
am not thinking only of the great viceroys,
the famous governors, the conquering generals; I am thinking about the work donc
throughout the subcontinent of India and
throughout many parts of Asia and Africa by
quite simple people-tha district officer, the
doctor, the missionary, the schoolmaster.
These men come from humble homes: the
small squire, the professional class, and above
all from vicarage and manse. The work they
did is not forgotten. It is still fruitful, more
fruitful perhaps than they ever could have
dreamed. All these ideas and examples have
revivified the old societies of the East, and if
now the new vigour and bursting energy of
these lands seems sometimes wrongly directed, let us remember this simple fact. In
the great struggle for the future of mankind
which has continued throughout all history
and is now perhaps more intense than ever,
the ideals of the commonwealth, steadily pursued, have put the commonwealth nations
firmly on the side of freedom.
Military alliances, economic pacts, formal
guarantees; all these are good and necessary
and have served us well. We in Britain are
proud to be the only nation to belong to all
three defensive groupings in the worldNATO, SEATO and the Baghdad pact. Nevertheless these do not of themselves bring us
new friends or win over the hesitant and
doubtful, for this is a struggle partly of power
and partly of ideas. In this struggle it is,
in my view, the ideas and the ideals which
will count in the long run, and in all these
the commonwealth of today has a vital role
to play.

It would be wrong to think that in this
world struggle we can take only a defensive
posture. The steady growth of the commonwealth is, indeed, the best evidence that our
way of life is positive and vital. That is what
we have to show to all the other peoples of
the world who are hesitating to commit
themselves, as well as to those who are at
present under the yoke of Soviet domination.
You may ask how will it all end. I do not
believe that we need fear the future if we
hold firm to our faith and our ideals. In time
even the monolithic dictatorships crumble and
change, for although the free world by its
very diversity often seems weak, in its variety
and above all in its freedom it is fundamentally strong. I do not believe that a purely
materialistic concept of life will forever satisfy men and women; nor do I fear a continuing struggle of ideas. This I think should
be our chosen battleground.
(Translation):
In this large family which is the commonwealth, Canada represents a link of vital
significance. Yours is a special position. I
believe that Canada and Great Britain have
never felt closer than at this time. We hope
and strive to increase that co-operation in
all fields. I have already referred to the
economie conference. It is more than that.
It is the feeling that you and I have Mr.
Prime Minister as members of the same team,
serving the sarne Queen, and humbly dedicated to identical aims.
And to you, French-speaking Canadians
particularly, I can say that you are living
examples of unity in the free world. The
traditions of French civilization were entrusted to your forefathers. In preserving
them with unwavering tenacity, you have
nevertheless successfully transformed and
adapted the traditions of the past. And by
this transformation you yourselves have developed. But other Canadians have changed
too. And from this blend, unique in the
world, rises the splendour of Canada as it
is today.

(Text):
May I with your permission, Mr. Speaker,
add a few words about the Old Country. It
is not too often that the people at home
talk much about themselves, except of course
in self-criticism. If you were to read what
the newspapers say about us, what the Opposition say about us, what the backbenchers
of the Government party say about us, what
the popular writers say about us, what the
television stars say about us, and what the
broadcasting experts and columnists say
about us, you would really think that the
poor Old Country was on the way out. But
this habit of self-criticism in the British
people-I should really say the English people
-can be very misleading.

the democratie world during the dark hours
of the war. In February 1956 we welcomed
the Right Honourable Anthony Eden, who
played such a great part in the administration
of the foreign affairs of his country. Today we
welcome you, the Right Honourable Mr.
Macmillan, who, in these uncertain days,
continue to play the same prominent part
as your predecessors.
To us you are the
personification of the importance and the
greatness of the United Kingdom. This relationship between our two countries is of the
highest order. Owing to our frequent consultations, we have been in a position to work
in perfect understanding for the promotion
of our mutual progress and development.
Has it not been said, and rightly so, that
the commonwealth countries constitute a vital
part of the business world? Although those
countries have evolved and have reached
nationhood, the similarities which they have
preserved create among this group of parliamentary democracies a relationship which
allows them to sprcad their influence throughout the world and to contribute to the establishment of a spirit of understanding and
cohesion.
We are confident, Mr. Prime Minister, that
this relationship will continue to be strengthened with the years.
The whole of Canada welcomes you as an
ambassador of friendship and of peace, two
sentiments which are made especially alive by
your kind presence here today. May I say
to you, sir, how deep an impression you
leave with us? Your visit here has extraordinary importance at a time w'hcn some
international
problems
remain unsolved.
Moreover, it symbolizes the loyalty which
unites our two countries, it is the symbol
of the sustained efforts your country made
after terrible years of hardships. If, at the
most critical time of history, we sometimes
tend to lose faith in the future, we only have
to look upon the glorious past of your country
to find new courage and energy.
We are ail rightly proud to be members
of the commonwealth, this group of partners
who, in a spirit of equality and fraternity,
work for the maintenance of peace and freedom in co-operation with other agencies of
world security. Such is the ideal you represent, Mr. Prime Minister, and in closing my
remarks I should like to endorse the opinion
expressed by one of our French-speaking
newspapers, on the occasion of your visit:
There is no doubt that, as were previous ones,
this meeting between the head of the Government
of Great Britain and the head of the Government
of Canada will be friendly and will afford both
countries a new opportunity to strengthen friendly
ties which are not to be neglected in the Western
world at the present time.

Therefore, I have the great honour, Mr.
Prime Minister, of expressing to you, on
behalf of this assembly which represents the

Canadian nation as a whole, our deep gratitude for your visit, and I should like to
transmit, through you, to ail your fellow
citizens, our sincere and friendly regards.
(Text):
Hon. Roland Michener (Speaker of the
House of Commons): Mr. Prime Minister
Macmillan, on behalf of the House of
Commons I have the honour to add our
words of appreciation to those expressed
by my colleague of the Senate. From our
point of view it is particularly appropriate
that you should have spoken to the Canadian
Parliament and people in this chamber, the
Green Chamber of the Commons. Although
it may look a bit strange to your parliamentary eye by reason of its expanse and
its comfortable armchairs and desks as contrasted with the narrow benches of your
own house, the Speaker's chair, which is an
exact replica of the one in Westminster from
whence it came as a gift of your Parliament,
should fill you with that familiar sense of
uncertain security which this ancient seat
has symbolized for generations of house
leaders.
You will agree, I believe, that in spirit we
are a true House of Commons in which
responsible government is carried on in the
British tradition, with only such variations
as were needed in a federal union of two
races and many regions.
As you have
remarked, these parliamentary institutions
and practices have taken root in ail the selfgoverning nations of the commonwealth, and
bind us together with an understanding of
each other's politics which is certainly a
broader if not a stronger bond of union than
those of language and race. So it has been
in your travels about the commonwealth;
you have been welcomed with pleasure and
understanding by fellow parliamentarians,
Asian, British and French, ahl speaking the
same language of the standing orders and
rules of procedure.
You have been welcomed, of course, for
your own sake; for your friendly charm and
your great personal attainments and, as our
Prime Minister has mentioned, in this case
for the presence of your charming wife. But
this commonwealth welcome is deeper. It
recognizes in you as the Prime Minister of
the original Parliament a personification of
the ancient source from which we have ail
drawn and to which we still look for living
example and inspiration, and through which
we communicate one with the other.
Knowing
your
heavy
responsibilities,
although you do your best to conceal them,
we are the more grateful that you have
found time to speak to us today. We thank
you for your message and your greetings.
We ask you to accept our heartfelt good
wishes and to carry them with you to your
own House of Commons and people.

other records required for the effective administration of Crown lands, mines, minerals,
timber and royalties. All Dominion Lands
Agency field office files and records were
turned over immediately to the provinces
concerned, and in 1931 Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta entered into supplementary
agreements with the federal Government,
whereby both parties agreed to safeguard all
records in their custody. Pursuant to these
agreements, a large percentage of the Department of the Interior Head Office land records,
files and registers have been transferred to
those three provinces. The Province of British
Columbia advised that they were not interested in acquiring similar records for the
Railway Belt and Peace River Block and
would not enter into a comparable agreement
for the safekeeping of any material transferred to them, so these records have been
placed in the Dominion Archives.
General files and policy files concerning
the natural resources of the western provinces
were retained by the federal Government,
and are under continuing examination in
order to ensure that all records containing
information of historical significance are
placed in the permanent custody of the
Dominion Archives. The federal Government
also retained 1,039 bound volumes of letter
press copies of Letters Patent covering approximately 520,000 grants of Dominion Lands
issued by the Department of the Interior
between 1883 and 1930, together with complete geographic and alphabetic cross-reference indices and registers. Each volume
contains copies of Letters Patent covering
lands in all four of the western provinces,
as they were recorded in straight numerical
sequence, chronologically, regardless of the
location of the lands. These volumes cannot
be separated without irreparable damage due
to their construction and antiquity, and the
legal opinion had been expressed that facsimile copies of Letters Patent can only be
considered as acceptable legal evidence for
so long as they remain in the bound books
in which they were originally placed. Therefore, they have been kept intact and are
maintained by the Department of Northern
Affairs and Natural Resources (formerly the
Department of the Interior), which furnishes
certified true copies of these documents to
the provinces concerned on request, in accordance with the terms of the Natural Resources Agreements.

THIRD READING

The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, when shall this bill be read the third
time?

Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Honourable senators,
with leave of the Senate I move the third
reading now.
Hon. David A. Croll: Honourable senators,
before this bill is read the third time, I have
a few observations that I would like to have
made yesterday but did not have the
opportunity.
This is a good bill, and I support it; as a
matter of fact, I support it wholeheartedly.
The honourable gentleman who moved the
second reading yesterday (Hon. Mr. Brunt),
made a very clear and informative statement,
but he neglected to mention that the bill was
Liberal legislation, passed by the Government of yesterday, and amended-and as a
matter of fact improved-today. The bill
permits the dominion Government to make
contributions to any province which has
signed an agreement and has in force a provincial law on hospitalization. It contains
two minor amendments and one major one.
The major amendment is of consequence. The
law as originally passed contained a limitation: in effect it provided that unless Canada's central provinces participated the act
could not go into effect. That was an unreasonable and unjustified veto. I opposed it
in other places and at other times because it
placed the dollar tag on the health of the
people. I urged a change, and so did others,
because a precedent was being created which
we objected to.
Many members of this house will remember that in the early 1920's an old age pension
bill was passed. The precedent then established was to the effect that the dominion
Government said to the provinces: "Come
and get it. If you want to participate you
can, and if you don't want to participate you
need not." Some provinces joined immediately and others took two or three years.
One province took nine years before it got
tired of contributing to the exchequer of
Canada money which was used for pension
purposes in other provinces. But that was a
matter for the province and no one except
the people residing in that province had any
reason to complain.
This hospital insurance legislation varied
that principle to the extent, as I say, of
giving a veto to both the central provinces,
something that was resented in the rest of
the country, for Saskatchewan, Alberta and
British Columbia already had hospital insurance plans, and good ones too. My own view
is that the best plan in existence is in Saskatchewan. That may be a matter on which
there is varied opinion. At any rate, these
provinces are ready to participate immediately, and it is a very healthy indication

SENATE
that Newfoundland too bas been pressing the
Government to bring the bill into effect.
I regret-and I mention here something
that I think should be mentioned-that the
Government did not sec fit to carry the
amendment further so as to make the act
cover tubercular and mental patients. That
is a failure in the act, and it is something
which should be righted as quickly as possible. As was indicated by the honourable
senator from Churchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar),
the act at present bas some shortcomings,
particularly as to uniformity. This can be
easily understood and it will take some time
to iron out the kinks. But it is not enough
for us to say "I told you so". It seems to
me that the people of Canada should pitch
in and make the bill work, and if it bas
deficiencies they will be corrected in due
time.
It is also very noteworthy that the medical
profession accepted the merit of hospital
insurance. They have donc more than that;
today they have accepted an extension of
the hospital insurance principle. So we have
reason to hope that in the not too distant
future they will accept further extensions of
benefits in the field of health. As we deal
with this legislation it takes on new importance because by it we are laying the groundwork for what is inevitable, the establishment of a health insurance plan. Certainly
we need a health insurance plan. The best
model I know of, as I have said on other
occasions in this house, is in Britain. We
need health insurance in Canada and we can
afford it.
I came across an interesting letter which
was published in the Toronto Globe and Mail
on Saturday, April 26, 1958. It was written
by a distinguished Hamilton doctor and as
many honourable senators may not have seen
it I think it would be worth while if I read
it to the house. It is addressed to a doctor,
and I quote:
To my colleague, Dr. Wallace, I would say:
"Look back upon that lonely road from whence
you came, that rough, uneven footpath, for its day
is done. It viii soon bc closed for ever. Sigh if
you must, even shed trars for its rapacious glorie,
but face the truth-the custom todaiy is to build
Glare at these nev
broad four-lane highways.
highways, grimace, nake faces, abuse thein-but
they are the only ones that can adequately meet
today's transportation needs.
"Medicine, too, needs the new look, the fourlane highway, namcly, the national hospital plan
and the national health insurance plan. Let's stop
the foolish beefing and get on with the job. Instead
of bucking this plan, as the doctors in England
did originally, we should get behind it and ofiler
the Government our help in formulating it in
such fashion that it will be of optimum value to
ail parties concerned, namely, the public, the
Government, and the doctors.
"Why make snide remarks about blackmail and
a Welfare State? How can such observations operate in the best interests of public relations? And

why be so frightened? Terrified of change? Unable
to face progress? Longing to go back to the really
rugged no-ceiling-on-hours, no-floor-under-wages
days, the days of sweat shops, child labour, and the
white plague? Prefer this type of hell to the
Welfare State?
Why?
The practice of good

medicine bas its economric as well as its scientific
aspect.
How good a job do we do as doctors
when we make a brilliant physical diagnosis,
prescribe an operation as a cure, then shock the
patient into a psychosis by telling him what it
will cost?"
Hamnilton.
Harry Paikin, M.D.

I cannot improve on that, honourable
senators. I can only say how glad I am to
have the present amendment to the act, with
the hope that before very long there will be
further useful amendments.
Hon. Mr. Sullivan: Will the honourable
senator permit a question?
Hon. Mr. Croll:

Certainly.

Hon. Mr. Sullivan: Would you please repeat the name of the doctor?
Hon. Mr. Croll: Harry Paikin, M. D. He is
a well-known and distinguished Hamilton
practitioner.
Hon. T. A. Crerar: Honourable senators, it
is not my intention to delay third reading
of the bill. Probably I should net have risen,
had iL not been for the remarks of my good
friend the honourable senator from TorontoSpadina (Hon. Mr. Crol). I must say at once
that I cannot share his fervid enthusiasm for
this measure. There are a few facts that I
think the house should know-facts which
were revealed in committee this morning and
are not before the Sonate at this moment.
It is estimated that if this scheme is brought
into effect throughout the ton provinces of
Canada before the end of this year, the total
expenditure required for 1959 will be at least
$430 million, of which the federal treasury's
contribution will be $215 million. With declining gross national product, honourable
senators, and the decline in corporation
profits, together with unemployment, I can
imagine that that is not a particularly pleasing prospect for the Minister of Finance to
face. However, lot that b.
We were further
told in committec that the total cost of $430
million shared equally between the provinces
and the federal Government is net, and cannot be regarded, as the limit of the total
expenditures that may be required. If costs
advance 10 per cent in the next year, we
were told, we can expect the costs under this
bill to increase by an equivalent amount.
Therefore, we must face the fact that this
proposed legislation will project into the
future and we do not know what the total
cost in the end may be.
I would say this, that if this measure is
administered with reasonable efficiency it is

JUNE 25, 1958
not going to depend on the Governments
which are behind it, but on the doctors who
have to look after their patients, because
there will be strong pressure to have the
slightest physical complaint treated in a hospital and come under this measure. The only
restraint on that kind of thing will be the
good faith of the medical men of this country.
They will need courage and plenty of it,
and I might add they may suffer a degree
of unpopularity also if they tell some patients
who desire to take advantage of free hospital
care, "There is no need for you to go to a
hospital." That will be the acid test.
I do not object to welfare legislation, but
I do deplore the easy fashion in which we
rush into expenditures of all kinds. The
essential purpose of Parliament is to protect
the taxpayer's money and to see that it is
wisely spent.
We have had hope that taxation might be
reduced. Honourable senators, we can dismiss that hope-there is no prospect of its
being realized for many years to come. The
only hope we now have is that we can keep
our total expenditures at approximately or
nearly the present level, excepting where
higher costs may be necessitated by growth
in population, and then trust to an increase
in the gross national product to reduce the
individual burden on each taxpayer. The
matter to me is one of great importance. The
country and Parliament, I am afraid, have
sort of become bemused with public expenditures and the notion is widespread everywhere that the spending of public money
will solve every economic question. Now, it
does not solve every economic question.
There is a human equation in all these questions that cannot be solved by the spending
of public money. As far as hospital insurance is concerned, I just wished to place
before the house the estimate of the total
cost of the scheme, and to indicate that we
need not be surprised in future if the costs
rise substantially above the figures I mentioned a few moments ago.
Motion agreed to, and bill read third time
and passed.

The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, when shall this bill be read the third

Hon. Lionel Choquette: With leave of the

Hon. W. Ross Macdonald: Honourable senators, before the bill is read the third time I
would like to mention something that was
brought to the attention of the committee this
morning by the honourable senator from
Ottawa East (Hon. Mr. Choquette): It will
be recalled that a couple of weeks ago, when
this bill was under consideration in the
Senate, we were all quite surprised to find
that the original act had not been proclaimed
and there was considerable discussion on this
point. The honourable senator from Ottawa
East informed the committee this morning
that the act was proclaimed on June 13, so
probably the Government took notice of our
discussion.
Hon. Mr. Quinn: That proves the value of
a good Opposition.
Motion agreed to, and bill read third time

this bill is exactly the same in the operative
section, word for word, as the bill introduced
in this house in January 1957, and which was
passed by this house and sent to the Conmons but did not arrive at the stage of a
vote in that house. The bill is being reintroduced this session.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, when shall this bill be read the second
time?
Hon. Mr. McKeen: Honourable senators,
I have been one of those who wish to see
plenty of time given to honourable senators
to study legislation so that no measure may

SENATE

pass without their full knowledge. But in
this particular case a similar bill has already
been passed by this house, so it hardly seems
necessary to have the usual delay between
the readings of the bill. I do not wish to
suggest any haste in dealing with the measure, but if it is agreeable to the house I
would move that the bill receive second reading today, and then be referred to the
Standing Committe on Transport and Communications-the same committee that considered the similar bill last year-where any
other questions could be answered.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Honourable senators may
I interject a suggestion that the honourable
senator should tell us what this bill contains?
This bill, or one similar to it, was before
the House of Commons early in 1957 and,
if my memory serves me right, it was talked
out.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: I think second reading
should stand until tomorrow.
Hon. Mr. Haig: In this case I think the
Senate should be careful to know what it
is doing. The honourable senator has not
given us the usual explanation on second
reading or told us what the bill is intended
to do. True, it was explained at a previous
session, but there are new senators here
who do not know what was done then.
I can perhaps speak with some authority
about this particular measure, because I happen to be a shareholder in the company.
I do not quite know what I should do;
maybe I should just keep quiet.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: You won't be able
to vote.
Hon. Mr. Haig: That is what you say.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I'il be watching you.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I think as a shareholder
I am more than ever entitled to know the
purpose and content of the bill on second
reading. Of course, all honourable senators
should know and understand what matters
are being passed by the Senate. We have a
procedure laid down and it has been found to
be satisfactory. In a case like this, especially
where the House of Commons bas already
talked out a similar bill, I think it would be
much better for the honourable senator sponsoring the bill to ask that second reading
stand until tomorrow, when he can give us
a full explanation of the principle and purpose of the bill.

PRIVATE BILL
CATHOLIC EPISCOPAL CORPORATION OF
TIMISKAMING-SECOND READING

Hon. Lionel Choqueite moved the second
reading of Bill S-5, respecting The Catholic
Episcopal Corporation of Timiskaming.
He said: Honourable senators, the purpose
of this bill is to change the name of The
Catholie Episcopal Corporation of Timiskaming to The Roman Catholic Episcopal Corporation of the Diocese of Timmins, to modernize its charter, which bas not been revised
since 1910, and to bring its objects, purposes
and powers in line with its present
requirements.
The revised and added clauses are similar
to those now usually included in private acts
incorporating religious bodies.
In 1910 the diocese was known for ecclesiastical purposes as the Vicariate Apostolic
of Timiskaming: it is now known for such
purposes as the Diocese of Timmins. Clause 1
of the present bill gives statutory recognition
to the new designation.
The objects of the bill are to better define the aim, object, rights, powers and
methods of administration of the corporation, to repeal certain sections of the act, the
continuance in force of which is no longer
required or expedient, and for all other
matters.
When the bill has been given second reading I will move that it be referred to the
Standing Committee on Miscellaneous Private
Bills.
Motion agreed to and bill read second time.

NORTH AMERICAN AIR DEFENCE
COMMAND
RESOLUTION FOR APPROVAL OF CANADAUNITED STATES AGREEMENT-DEBATE

CONTINUED

The Senate resumed from yesterday the
adjourned debate on the motion of Hon. Mr.
Aseltine, seconded by Hon. Mr. Haig:
That it is expedient that the Houses of Parliament do approve an exchange of notes constituting
an Agreement between the Government of Canada
and the Government of the United States of

SENATE
America concerning the Organization and Operation of the North American Air Defence Command
(NORAD) signed at Washington, 12th May, 1958,
and that this house do approve the sarne.

Hon. John J. Connolly (Ottawa West): Honourable senators, this motion occasions discussion of a topic as important perhaps as
any that comes before this branch of Parliament, because it is a discussion of an international agreement on national defence. It
deals with defence in thermonuclear times,
the defence of our own territory, the defence
of our way of life, and indeed the defence
of life itself.
We do not have too many opportunities
in the Senate to consider defence problems
and policy, and I for one-and I am sure all
honourable senators join me-welcome this
opportunity, because defence is an important part of our national life, and indeed of
our national economy. One need only look
at the Budget Papers for 1958 to sec that
33.2 per cent of our budgetary expenditures
for the fiscal year 1958-59, or a total of
$1,783,600,000 is to be spent on defence. Perhaps it is significant to compare this figure
with that of 1954-55, when defence expenditures were largest.
In that year they
accounted for 42.8 per cent of the budgetary
expenditures, with a total of $1,908 million.
It might be worth while to report the distribution of present expenditures upon the
various branches of the armed services. For
the Army they will be $387.6 million; for the
Navy, $262.7 million; for the Air Force, $760
million; for defence research, $78.7 million;
for NATO charges and the cost of mutual
aid under the NATO Treaty, $118.4 million;
for pensions and administration in the
armed services, $70.1 million.
Perhaps, while making a short personal
apology for entering upon this discussion, I
may be allowed to mention that for four
years during the late war I had an association
with the Honourable Angus L. Macdonald
when he was Minister of National Defence
for Naval Services; and naturally an experience of that kind does develop in one an interest not only in the armed services but,
generally, in defence policy. The late minister was, of course, associated with two very
remarkable men: one, a colleague who unfortunately is not present today, namely, the
honourable senator from Gulf (Hon. Mr.
Power) who was air minister, and the late
J. L. Ralston, who was Minister of National
Defence during the war. They were outstanding members of an outstanding ministry
which directed an outstanding war effort; and
they enjoyed the confidence of the public, of
our allies, and, certainly, of the servicemen
over whose affairs they were presiding.

After the war, in 1945, Canada joined the
United Nations. In 1948, prompted largely
by the vision of the then Prime Minister, Mr.
St. Laurent, and his Secretary of State for
External Affairs, Mr. Pearson, Canada was
connected with the establishment of the North
Atlantic Organization, and she is one of the
14 members of the NATO group. The NATO
Treaty is Canada's principal defensive alliance; indeed, it is the principal defensive
alliance in existence in the Western world.
I think it is desirable, because of the importance of that treaty, to discuss this agreement
with respect to the North American Air
Defence Command, or NORAD, against the
background of NATO and of the arrangements between Canada and the United States
to which the honourable Leader of the Government here (Hon. Mr. Aseltine) referred
last evening.
Honourable senators will note that NATO
has been described at various times as "the
shield of the West". That, indeed, it is. In
the earlier years of its establishment it was
conceived that Europe was the great target,
and that the purpose of NATO was to establish in the European theatre, on the European
continent, the necessary conventional forces
to offset any threat from bchind the Iron
Curtain. It may be worth while briefly to
refer to the organization in NATO which was
originally set up and which still exists. There
was a Supreme Allied Commander, with
hcadquarters in Europe; and under him, four
major commands-Northern Europe, Central
Europe, Southern Europe, and the Mediterranean area. There was a Supreme Allied
Commander located in the Atlantic area, and
two general districts-the Eastern Atlantic
Command, centred in the United Kingdom,
where there is a naval commander and an
air commander, and a Western Atlantic command in the United States, at Norfolk, Virginia, where there is a commander of the
Western Atlantic air force and a commander
of the Striking Fleet. There is also another
principal segment of NATO, known as the
Channel command, which consists of a Commander-in-Chief at Portsmouth-a Navy man
-and
an Air Commander-in-Chief of the
Channel at Northwood. Finally, there is a
fourth division-and I mention this because
it does bear upon the subject-matter of this
motion-namely, the Canada-United States
regional planning group, which consists of
the Chiefs of Staff of these two countries.
I think it would be appropriate to mention
Canada's contribution to the NATO organization in Europe. Our Army there consists of
some 5,600 men of all ranks. The Air Force
has four wings, each with squadrons of
CF 100s and F 86 jet fighters, one squadron
of CF 100 Mark 4B all-weather fighters, and

SENATE
the establishment on the North American continent of the three defence warning lines to
which the Leader of the Government referred
last night.
I would like to mention at this stage
that the establishment of these lines was
not done within the NATO organization. It
was done as a result of collaboration between
the Governments of Canada and the United
The
States, and it was outside of NATO.
Pinetree line was built and manned partly
by United States and partly by Canada, running from British Columbia through the
Prairies, through the settled parts of central
Canada, up through Nova Scotia to Labrador.
The mid-Canada line is an all-Canadian line

built and manned by the United States air
force and it runs roughly from Midway,
through Honolulu, Alaska, the Arctic region,
across Baffinland to Greenland, and it maintains patrol ships in the Atlantic and Pacific.
These lines were built to assist our air
forces. According to a statement made by
the minister in the Estimates Committee
of the other place, nine RCAF squadrons
of CF-100's are available for the defence
of this country and use these lines for warning purposes. It is said there are similar
aircraft in the United States air force available for this work, plus aircraft of the
Strategic Air Command of the United States
air force, called SAC. These lines will of
course continue to be used for the detection
of aircraft. Just to what extent they are
obsolete for the detection of missiles or are
available for the detection of missiles is
another matter. I think it is something which
could be inquired into when we get to the
committee stage.
What is the threat against which this
defensive establishment is being built? The
minister says that Russia has some 1,500 to
1,700 bombers capable of attacking targets
anywhere on the American continent and
returning to Russian soil. In addition. there
are other Russian bombers, of course, not
capable of such long flights, and further
there is the intercontinental ballistic missile.
What then is the plan of defence against
this threat? The minister again has done a
service to Parliament by describing the military concept of NATO as a deterrent force,
consisting of two elements. First, the Shield
force, stationed at various parts of the world,
to protect NATO countries and give warning
of an impending attack. The other element
is the forces of retaliation, which are called
The minister has said
the Sword forces.
that these Sword forces consist of three elements. First, the SAC of the U.S. air force;

secondly, the medium bombers of th2 Royal
Air Force in the United Kingdon; and,
thirdly, missiles of medium range, which
are now, apparently, being made available
to some of the countries in Europe, at least
to the United Kingdom. From this it would
appear, honourable senators, that Canada
has no Sword forces. Canada is equipped
only with what is described under the NATO
concept as Shield forces, and it would appear
that the four wings which Canada has contributed to the NATO establishment in
Europe are not members of any Sword
force; they are not retaliatory forces, they
are Shield forces. I have no informationand perhaps we should make inquiry, if we
are not going to violate security by doing
so-as to what kind of armaments are carried by the elements of these Shield forces,
particularly by our own aircraft. The minister, on June 16, said that there are no
arrangements whereby Canadian forces may
use atomic weapons made in the United
States. Indecd, I understand from the press
today that in the United States Senate a bill
was passed yesterday, or very reccntly,
which would prohibit any American-made
missile of this kind from being used by an
aircraft of another country. So we do not
know-at least. I do not know-just what
armament a Canadian Shield force operating
either in North America or Europe carries.
On June 10 last, as appears at page 996 of
the Commons Hansard, the Prime Minister
set out what is known as the rules of engagement, which had been approved by the
defence committee of the cabinet on December 12, 1951 and published in R.C.A.F. orders
on June 15, 1957. These rules of engagement
specify the limits within which these shield
forces would operate. I would commend to
honourable senators the reading of those
rules, brief though they are, because I think
they are an attempt to eliminate any irresponsible human action or error in connection
with the work of these air forces. They can
be summarized in this way: The air defence

authorize these approaching aircraft to be

may authorize these aircraft to be forced to
land for identification, or, if they refuse to
land, to be engaged. And of course he may
order them to be engaged if a hostile act
occurs. A hostile act is defined as an attack,
the opening of bomb-bay doors near a vital
area, the dropping of parachutists or the laying of mines. These rules, honourable senators, were drawn in collaboration with the

JUNE 25, 1958
Chiefs of Staff of both Canada and the United
States. I do not know, but I wonder whether
they are the same rules which would apply
to the Shield forces in which we Canadians
through the R.C.A.F. participate in Europe,
and I think we should have some information
on that if it could be made available.
The defence establishment heretofore used
for the defence of North America, has been
based upon the close co-operation of Canada
and the United States, but there has been no
integrated
authoritative
command.
The
NORAD agreement was originally tentatively
entered into on August 1 of last year, and
the agreement dated May 12, 1958 would
make it final when approved.
Again I
say this is a bilateral agreement between
the United States and Canada.
There
is a place in the NATO organization for such
a command. What I ask is whether or not
the making of this bilateral agreement with
the United States in any way weakens the
position of NATO or our position in NATO.
Or perhaps I could put it the other way:
Might it be a strengthening of the NATO
organization, which everybody seems to think
is essential and extremely important, not only
for us but for the whole Western world?
Might it be a strengthening of the NATO
organization if the NORAD command became
part of NATO? The purpose of this command
is to exercise operational control over the
combat units of these two countries. It is
said that the plans and the procedures to be
followed by NORAD in wartime shall be
formulated and approved in peacetime by
appropriate national authority. This is item
6 of the agreement. NORAD apparently does
not do any planning. Last evening, the
Leader of the Government (Hon. Mr. Aseltine) said that there were variations in the
planning done in the two countries at times.
What I ask is, whether or not the establishment of NORAD, which is a command and
not a planning group, will eliminate these
variations in the plans established by the two
groups.
Now, in connection with the NORAD
agreement and the new command at Colorado
Springs, we have at present no information
as to what combat units are to be assigned
by Canada. It is said that as yet none have
been assigned. How many will be assigned
has yet to be determined, and perhaps cannot
be disclosed. But are they the nine squadrons
of the CF-100 defence command which have
been available heretofore for the defence of
this continent? Are they still to be controlled
from St. Hubert where they were formerly
controlled? Are there going to be any new
aircraft, any improved aircraft? What is the
armament to be on the aircraft that will be

used by the Canadian forces in this command? Are there other R.C.A.F. aircraft in
Canada which are not be assigned to NORAD?
In other words, is our whole domestic air
establishment to be assigned to this new
command?
What is the United States contribution? If
we can ask that kind of question I think it
might help us a great deal in understanding
the defence requirement and our own participation in it, and, too, what armament is
to be made available to the aircraft of both
countries.
I come back for just a moment to the
Sword forces in North America, namely, the
SAC bombers of the United States air forces.
The minister has said that none of them are
stationed in Canada, none of them have been
sent to NATO, that they would be sent on
their mission of retaliation on instructions of
the President of the United States only.
I wonder if the same applies to the other
elements of the Sword forces in the United
Kingdom, namely, the medium bombers of
the RAF, and I ask: Is this arrangement in
connection with these forces of retaliation the
most effective arrangement for the defence of
North America?
It is said that these forces are part of a
defensive force, that they are to be used for
retaliation, but if retaliation is not an offensive act it approaches that position very
closely. In other words, is the use of these
Sword forces equivalent to an act of war?
Perhaps it may be for the country against
whom retaliation is carried out to say whether
it is an act of war or not, but if it is
an act of war and if it is launched from
North America what does it do to our position
in NATO? What does it do to our position
in the commonwealth?
I understand that there is a distinction,
of course, between a purely defensive act
and a retaliatory act, an act of war or
a hostile act and finally a declaration of war.
But how far will the use of these Sword
forces involve Canada in war, and how
quickly?
And what happens to the rights of Parliament? We talk a good deal about safeguarding the right of Parliament to declare
whether war shall occur or not. Just what
happens to that Parliamentary position, I
think, is not made clear.
I think this inquiry is an appropriate
inquiry to be made by the Senate. It can
be made in the detached and non-political
atmosphere that prevails in this house, because it is a serious attempt to estimate the
adequacy and the extent of our defence arrangements and commitments. Defence, after
all, must be conducted on the advice of the
chiefs of the armed 3ervices, but its control

SENATE
and the control of foreign policy ultimately
lie with Parliament.
I do say that whether the defence of North
America is done by bilateral agreement, as is
now being done, or whether it is done
through the establishment of NATO, it is
essential that it be done.
In conclusion, I should like to refer to the
satisfaction Canadians must feel that an
agreement of this importance could be
reached by Canada with the United States.
Certainly it is in the interests of the Americans that Canada should co-operate, but it is

also a source of satisfaction that the co-operation of their Government should be giveni
so completely. This co-operation has resulted
from many years of fruitful mutual understanding and endeavour. In a task so perilous it is of paramount importance that
this relationship be preserved and strengthened.

REPORT OF COMMITTEE

Hon. Norman P. Lambert, Chairman of the
Standing Committee on External Relations,
presented the following report of the committee:
The Standing Committee on External Relations,
pursuant to the Order of Reference of June 24, 1958,
has considered the Agreement between the Government of Canada and the Government of the United
States of America concerning the Organization and
Operation of the North American Air Defence Command (NORAD), signed at Washington, 12th May,
1958.
The Honourable George R. Pearkes, Minister of
National Defence, and Mr. Jules Léger, UnderSecretary of State for External Affairs, appeared
before the committee and explained the terms of
the said Agreement and the manner in which it will
operate in the defence of North America.
Your committee wishes to express its appreciation
for the lucid explanations given to the committee
by the minister.
Your committee recommends the said Agreement
to the favourable consideration of the Senate.
Your committee further recommends that authority be given for the printing of 800 copies in English
and 200 copies in French of the proceedings of the
committee with respect to the Agreement.

(NORAD) signed at Washington, 12th May, 1958, and
that this house do approve the same.

Honourable
Hon. W. Ross Macdonald:
senators, it is not my intention to take up
a great deal of the time of this house in
discussing this resolution. There was quite
a protracted debate on the subject in the
other house. Yesterday the Honourable Mr.
Pearkes, Minister of National Defence, appeared before the Standing Committee on
External Relations and, as the honourable
the senior senator from Ottawa (Hon. Mr.
Lambert) has said, gave a very able explanation of the agreement and answered freely
all questions which were put to him. I have
no doubt that this house will certainly give
favourable consideration to this agreement,
as is suggested by the committee.
It is, however, unfortunate that the manner
in which this agreement was presented to

that I can command, that no step whatever will be
taken binding this country-indeed no step can be
taken whatever might be the will of the representative of Canada, which would have force or effect
before ratification by the Parliament of this
dominion.

So, honourable senators, you will see that
I am calling very good witnesses on behalf
of my contention that all agreements of this
nature should be presented to Parliament.
And now I call another witness. A moment ago I stated that since 1926 the practice
of presenting similar treaties and resolutions
to Parliament was decided in the House of
Commons. On June 21, 1926 Mr. MacKenzie
King moved the following resolution:
This House approves of the procedure proposed
for the negotiation, signature and ratification of
treaties and conventions, and considers further that
before His Majesty's Canadian ministers advise
ratification of a treaty or convention affecting
Canada, or signify acceptance of any treaty, convention or agreement involving military or economie
sanctions, the approval of the Parliament of Canada
should be secured.

JUNE 26, 1958
The Prime Minister, referring to this, said
And in speaking in that debate on the same
day Mr. King said, as reported at page 4768 he did not feel that a correct interpretation
had been given to Mr. Spaak's statement.
of the Commons Hansard:
In the report of his remarks which I read
What I wished to make clear, however, was that
the Prime Minister used these words:
all treaties or conventions involving military or
economic sanctions must come before Parliament,
and where military or economic sanctions were
involved I wished to make the terms broad enough
to include agreements so that in referring to treaties
or agreements of any kind we would not have a
difference over the mere use of words.

On April 12, 1928 Mr. Bennett, then Leader
of the Opposition, took part in a discussion of
of the International Sanitary Convention, and
he used these very interesting words, which
will be found at page 1968 of the Commons
Hansard:
The ratification of a convention is, of course, as
the Minister of Justice has said, a prerogative of
the Crown. The Crown acts on the advice of its
ministers, and in this instance the ministers from
Canada will advise the Crown that the convention
is a sound one in which Canada concurs, if the
Canadian Parliament, comprising both the Commons and the Senate, approves of it. I wholly agree
that it is desirable-indeed I have always so heldthat both the Commons and the Senate of Parliament
should be asked to approve of conventions or
treaties that carry international implications or
responsibilities. That, I think, is clear.

Honourable senators, I do not understand
why there was so much delay in bringing
this agreement before Parliament or why
there was any question about it. I have
quoted the views of former Prime Ministers
since Sir Robert Borden; and, as honourable
senators know, during the time the Right
Honourable Louis St. Laurent was Prime
Minister all resolutions and agreements of this
nature were brought before Parliament for
approval. But on this occasion there was
some hesitancy about bringing the agreement
forward; there seemed to be a reluctance on
the part of the present Government in this
respect. I am rather glad there was that
hesitancy, because I think it bas pointed up
for the benefit of future governments the
necessity of submitting agreements of this
nature to Parliament. Surely, in view of
what has been said by our former Prime
Ministers, there will never again be any
delay in bringing an agreement of this nature
before both houses for their consideration
and approval.
I would refer honourable senators also to
the discussion as to whether NORAD is part
of NATO, and the rather contradictory, or at
least conflicting, statements in that regard,
which created an air of mystery about
NORAD. You will recall that Mr. Spaak, Secretary General of NATO, was asked if he
considered NORAD to be part of NATO. In
reply he is reported to have said it was not.
His words were:
It is not under the command of NATO. NORAD
has never been referred to or discussed in NATO.

Mr. Spaak must have had in mind the fact that
NORAD is not strictly speaking a NATO command.
There is no NATO command in North America.
Military planning in the area is, however, reported
States
through the Canada-United
to NATO
Regional Planning Group which is made up of the
Chiefs of Staff of both countries. This group reports to the standing group and through the agency
to the military committee in the NATO council.
Accordingly, the NATO Council is kept informed
of air defence arrangements in the Canada-United
States region.

I say that this discussion as to whether
NORAD was or was not in NATO also
created a feeling among us all that there
must be something mysterious about this
agreement.
Honourable senators will also recall that
about this time there came to Canada the
Commander-in-Chief of NORAD, LieutenantGeneral Earle Partridge of the United States
Air Force, and the Deputy Commander, Air
Marshal Roy Slemon of the R.C.A.F. On
practically all previous occasions when highranking officers have been in Canada an informal session of both Houses of Parliament
has been held in the Commons Railway Committee room, and the visiting officer bas been
invited to come there and talk frankly and
freely to us, not in the presence of the press,
about what is taking place under his command. We were addressed at such a meeting
by General Montgomery, by General Norstad
and by General Gruenther, but, for some
reason or other, General Partridge was not
asked to speak to us. There again, we thought
there must be something very mysterious
about this agreement.
Of course, honourable senators, there is
nothing mysterious about the agreement. If,
prior to yesterday, we thought there was
something mysterious about it, we were told
quite frankly by Mr. Pearkes that it was a
simple agreement, clearly drawn up between
two countries; that it was a straightforward
agreement for the setting up of a system of
integrated operational control for the Air
Defence in the continental United States,
Canada and Alaska, under an integrated
command responsible to the Chiefs of Staff
of both countries.
The agreement, as I have said, is a very
simple one. It is in the nature of a five-page
letter written by the Canadian Ambassador
to the United States, at Washington, to the
Honourable John Foster Dulles, Secretary of
State of the United States, setting forth what
had been agreed upon over a period of some
time. The negotiations were concluded and

SENATE
the agreement was put in words by the Canadian Ambassador, and it was accepted by the
secretary, in a letter consisting of 12 lines.
So it was a forthright, simple, single, integrated system. I agree entirely with the remarks made by the honourable Leader of the
Government here (Hon. Mr. Aseltine) yesterday, which I would like to quote at this time.
They are found at page 195 of Hansard:
-that Canada alone does not have the necessary
air power, manpower, and other resources to defend its extensive territories in the event of any
such attack as I have mentioned. The United
States has these resources in abundance, and therefore it seems to me that an agreement such as
NORAD is necessary with respect to our joint
defences. We need the help of the United States,
and they also need our assistance.

The only other comment I would like to
make is that I am not so sure that NORAD
is able to provide an effective defence against
an attacking force. I often wonder whether
we are not making too much of this organization. The honourable Leader of the Government, in speaking on this motion, stated:
Our survival may depend upon it.

Well, honourable senators, I feel that, if we
are to depend on NORAD for our survival,
our survival is not too certain. The fact is
that NORAD will not defend us. The joint air
forces of both countries could not possibly
prevent all enemy bombers from getting
through, and it would take comparatively few
to destroy both our countries. The forces of
NORAD could demolish some of the enemy
bombers, but the others would get through.
To rely on NORAD is, in my opinion, to
create a false sense of security. General Curtis
LeMay, Vice-Chief of Staff of the United
States air force, is reported in the Toronto
Daily Star of June 12 to have said that not
more than 25 to 30 per cent of any attacking
force could be intercepted. Here is a quotation from the editorial:
Gen. Curtis LcMay, Vice-Chief of Staff of the
U. S. air force, bas estimated that 25 to 30 per cent
is the maximum attrition that either U.S. or Soviet
air defences ight inflict on an attacking bomber
foirce. The Sovits can send thousands of bombers
against us. Anri oiy 50 to 150 of them would need
to reach their targets with thermonuclear bombs in
order to wreak imnnediate catastrophic damage on
North America, according to George W. Rathjens,
Jr.. defence analyst of the U. S. defence department, writing in the current Bulletin of the Atomic
Scientists.

If only one plane got through and dropped
one bomb, it would destroy us. So I do not
think we should rely too strongly on NORAD,
or we may not be here to know the consequences. In 1939 France relied on the Maginot
line. We all know what happened. Shortly
after the Second World War we felt that we
had an adequate defence in the Pine Tree
system, which was built and operated jointly
by Canada and the United States. This was

followed, in 1953, by the Mid-Canada line,
and later, by the Distant Early Warning line.
We now find that this radar warning installation is necessary and helpful, and gives us
necessary information; but, honourable senators, it does not provide the defence for
which it was intended. In my opinion there
is only one adequate form of defence, and
that is offence. The only deterrent to aggression is the fact that the attacking force knows
that the military strength of the democracies,
or, shall I say, of the Western alliance, is at
least equal if not superior to that of the
aggressor, and that the retaliation for any
attack would be as great as if not greater
than that carried out by the aggressor.
I am sure that honourable senators who were
present at the committee meeting yesterday
were shocked, although they had heard it
before, to learn that Canada has no means
of carrying out retaliation. I am not saying
that we are not in a position to have retaliatory forces. But the fact is we have not got
them.
And if the only adequate form of
defence is offence, with the knowledge on
the part of the other side that we can retaliate, Canada must rely for that very
important form of defence on sone other
nation.
There is no doubt as to our position in that matter. In this connection I
will quote from the report of yesterday's
proceedings:
Sncator
lMacdonald: I do net want to press tiis
too far; I do not kxnow whethîer you want to ansver thi
question or not: Who would order
retaliation?
lion Mr. Pearkes: My understanding is that the
only person who can order retaliation at the present time is the President of the United States.
Senator Macdonald: But as far as Ca.nacla is
concerned?
I-on. Mr. Pearkcs: We have no means of carrying out rataliation. We have no bombers and we
have no means at the present time of carrying out
any retaliation or counter offensive. All our air
force can do here is defensive.

laving said all this, honourable senators, it
may appear that, when I say I feel that
approval of this agreement is quite necessary,
I am taling a rather contradictory position.
Although it is not an adequate defence and
I do not think we can rely upon it, I do
feel very keenly that it must be put into
etlect. I could go on at length and refer
to destruction which can come to Canada,
te Arnerica, from sources other than the air,
but I will not take the time of this house to
do se. We must put up every defence possible and at the same time we must cooperate and work together with the United
States.
In this instance, so far as our
defences are concerned, there must be intermeddling by Canada in the affairs of the
United States and by that country in the

JUNE
affairs of Canada. This is a very worthwhile agreement, and as far as it goes it
will at least bring our two peoples together
and make them realize that the defence of
one country is vital to the defence of the
other, that we are standing together in the
defence of the North American continent
and, in fact, of the peace of the world.
Honourable senators, I trust that this agreement will meet with the unanimous approval
of this house.
Hon. Arthur W. Roebuck: Honourable
senators, in contributing a few words to this
debate I would like to compliment my
honourable leader (Hon. Mr. Macdonald) on
the speech that he has just made. However,
there is one particular comment I wish to
make. He stated that the only alternative
to defence is retaliation or aggression, attack
by ourselves. I would like to add one more
thought, that the really successful way of
defeating an enemy is by making him a
friend. I think everybody will agree with me
in that, and also that it is very bad policy on
the part of the Western world to view our
potential enemy-and we all know whom
we are thinking about-as being entirely
evil. It might be that there is as much virtue
among some of the people behind the Iron
Curtain as there is among some of the people
on this side of it, and that the distribution of
good will is not all on our side. In view of
the dangers which we may meet, reliance to
some extent on the good will of our potential
enemy is not to be counted out, and every
effort should be made and all patience
exhibited to take advantage of the peace
party across the line. In our search for
peace we should be as careful as we can
not to appear aggressive, and we should do
what we can to lessen tension between
Western countries and those behind the Iron
Curtain, always bearing in mind that war
is a game in which all parties rise losers.
Both sides in an atomic attack would rise
losers, and the real accomplishment would
be for us to make a friend out of a potential enemy and thus thoroughly defeat him.
It would be a victory for us and a victory
for the others at the same time.
There was one question I asked in committee which I do not believe was answered.
My honourable leader said that all questions
had been freely and frankly answered in
committee. I agree with him that General
Pearkes made a fine statement and that he
was very frank in what he said. He told us
what he knew. But I do not think he had
the answer to my question. I asked if there
was any general arrangement, understanding
or agreement between Canada and the United

States as to how much each should contribute to the cost of carrying out this agreement. General Pearkes had stated that we
are partners in the defence of North America, and that is true. Geography settles that.
We are the joint tenants of one continent and
the facts of geography make it absolutely
necessary that we work together as partners.
Since we are partners in this military enterprise I believe it is most important that there
be a clear understanding as to the cost of
carrying out this agreement. As I stated in
committee, it is the duty of Parliament to
take care of the interests of the taxpayer,
but unfortunately some of my colleagues and
I are under some handicaps in that regard,
for we lack knowledge as to what actually
is going on in our own Defence Department.
It is most important that the taxpayer of
Canada has no opportunity to feel he is
being overtaxed or that the burden which
this small country is bearing is out of proportion to that borne by our bigger neighbour
to the south. It is equally important that the
people and the Government of the United
States have no grounds for supposing that
they are carrying the greater proportionate
burden and that Canada is not playing her
part or carrying her own share. So when I
asked the question as to whether there was
any arrangement, understanding or principle
upon which we were proceeding, I was disappointed when General Pearkes did not
answer me. He did not state whether there
was any principle. It seems to me we are
acting in a haphazard way, making little
agreements on various points rather than
taking a big view of the whole situation.
There should be some formula. It could be
based on population. Another formula could
be based on our national production, and it
seems to me that this is the better basis upon
which to decide what each country should
contribute. But if we do decide on a formula,
it should be clearly stated and understood
what our share of the burden is and what the
United States' share is, and that we are carrying our share of the burden, pulling our own
weight, and that the United States has no
grounds for thinking that it is the superior
partner in the agreement because it is the
larger. I think that feature as between us
should be given very serious consideration.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Honourable senators,The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, if the honourable Leader of the Government (Hon. Mr. Aseltine) speaks now, he
will of course close the debate.
Hon. John T. Haig: Honourable members,
I did not intend to join in this debate at all,
because I felt that our leader (Hon. Mr.
Aseltine) put the case very fairly. However,

SENATE
some words which have been spoken this
afternoon have given me a little trouble, and
as one representing the western part of Canada I wish to say a word or two as to our
position. I am not going to discuss the speech
made by the Leader of the Opposition (Hon.
Mr. Macdonald) as to whether Mr. Diefenbaker's Government did rightly or wrongly
in the manner of presenting this agreement
to Parliament, but if it acted wrongly and
if that is the only mistake it has made, I am
satisfied.
I want to discuss a problem which troubles
me greatly, a problem that was raised by my
honourable friend from Toronto-Trinity (Hon.
Mr. Roebuck). If we are in the difficult position of facing the probability of war with
Russia, I do not think now is the time to
talk about our getting ready to fight that
country. I do not think our small population
of 17 million people, spread over the largest
tract of land occupied by so small a number
of people anywhere in the world, has any
right to suggest that they are going to get
ready to fight a great nation like Russia. We
have to recognize the fact, whether we like
it or not, that the next world war will be
fought between the United States and ber
allies on one side, and Russia and ber allies
on the other. Anybody who knows anything
about the Russians, and anyone who has had
the pleasure and honour of being at the
United Nations, as I had for two or three
months, knows the reactions of the Russian
people, and realizes that they cannot bc
trusted at all. Within twelve hours of reaching a decision they will deny having done so.
That happened in the legal committee on the
definition of what a day is.
Honourable senators, we are very fortunate
that the people of the United States are our
kinsmen in blood, ambition and heritage, in
love of life and freedom, and in the desire
to be fair to other peoples of the world.

for defence. A population of 17 million cannot be expected to meet commitments to the
same extent as a population of 160 million;
that is impossible.
Now, I know that the United States makes
mistakes; I know that we in Manitoba make
mistakes. I know it, but I do not admit it.
The same applies to any other part of Canada.
But the point is this, that fundamentally,
when the chips are down, as we sometimes
say, you can depend on Manitoba sticking
by Canada. In the same way, when the chips
are down you can depend on the United
States to stand on the side of freedom. Make
no mistake about it. That is true, whether we
pay a dollar, a cent, or nothing at all. We
can depend on those men and women over
there to help us to save our freedom if necessary, and the only way to defend our freedom is to stand with them, and they with
us, to the best of our ability. We must say to
them, "We will stand with you and carry
the load to the limit we are capable of, and
you can trust our people the same as if they
were your own people." Only in that way
will the free world bc able to live through
the catastrophe that we may have to face.
The Leader of the Opposition by his very
statements indicated to me that be had in
his mind that such a catastrophe might happen. My honourable friend from TorontoTrinity thinks the same way, and wants to
bring it down to dollars and cents.

great nation is going to be put to the very sweep toward Winnipeg-and Winnipeg will
test of steel to defend freedom in the world, disappear-and Chicago and other great cities
and we must not allow any question to arise of the central part of the United States. The

whether the United States is paying its share, kind of submarines, and New York will be

JUNE 26, 1958
bombed, and Montreal, St. John's, Halifax,
and all the rest of our cities; but by and
large, if we stand one hundred per cent by
the people of the United States and tell them
that we are depending on them, and assure
them that they can depend on us, then, and
only then, shall we be able to stand by the
right as free men, and thus deserve freedom
after the war is over.
Until I came to Parliament this session I
did not realize there was so much feeling of
unrest here regarding Russia as apparently
there is. That feeling does not seem to have
spread through the provinces yet. Unfortunately, it does not appear that we are in
any better position to deal with Russia than
we were a year ago. If anything, we have
lost ground, not to Russia, but in our relations with her. There is a feeling abroad that
something is slipping in Russia, that perhaps
her people are not getting sufficient food and
clothes and are being oppressed. We all remember the recent attack on Hungary, which,
together with other incidents, has led us to
fear what Russia might attempt to do. I recall
that when the former Supreme Allied Commander of the Forces in Europe was here,
two or three years ago, we asked him how
long it would take for bombs to be got ready
and distributed if they were needed. He replied, "I would have to get authority, but I
think it would take half an hour." We knew
what he meant. We knew that just as soon as
the Russians moved, he would move too. We
did not discuss it afterwards and criticize
him for that statement, but we accepted it
as a fact that if the necessity arose Canadians
were prepared to stand with him.
I am not too sure whether it is because of
the machines that are flying through the air
at terrific speed, or what it is, but the confidence of the people of this country has slipped a little when we compare our standing
with that of Russia today. This agreement is
evidence to me at least, and I hope to all of
the Canadian people, that both Canada and
the United States are trying to work out a
system of defence that will be of the greatest
advantage to both countries in the protection
of this part of the world for freedom, when
and if the great struggle occurs.
Honourable senators, I want to thank the
Leader of the Opposition (Hon. Mr. Macdonald) for the manner in which he bas
handled his part in this debate. I congratulate you, sir. I think it has been very fine of
you to permit this resolution to be adopted
today. It will show the American people
that we as Canadians are united, that we
want to do what is advantageous as quickly as
possible, that we all want to stand behind the
word of our Government in this matter. Now,
we may differ as to whether this Government

is a good one or a bad one, but to me it is a
good one. In any event, the fact is that we
as Canadians are united to do the best we
can in the defence of our neighbouring country and of our own country. On my own
behalf-because I have no right to speak for
the Government-I repeat my thanks for the
way in which the Leader of the Opposition
has conducted his part in this debate. It bas
been very encouraging to me. I do not think
that I would have done it as well when I was
Leader of the Opposition; I do not think I
would have been as confident. To me it is
a very fine gesture. It will have the effect of
showing the people that the Senate of Canada
is comprised of men who can differ and yet
agree to do the best thing possible, even
though somebody else may have made some
mistake along the line.
I am glad to have had this opportunity
to express my views and I hope I have not
said anything that will offend anybody. I am
a keen Canadian. My colleague the honourable senator from Winnipeg South (Hon. Mr.
Thorvaldson), in speaking to me about the
new Conservative Government in our province of Manitoba, said, "Jack, are you the
last member of the last Conservative Government that sat in Manitoba?" I said, "Yes,
I am the last living member of either side of
the house of 1914, and I was there when the
last Conservative Government went out of
power." I hope that I will not live to see
the Parliament of Canada go out of power
by reason of a war with Russia. I can say
without fear of contradiction that the boys
and girls of today and the men and women of
our country will stand four-square united for
the freedom of our people and the freedom
of the other people of the world, to help
secure for them a fair deal. We will stand
with the United States no matter what mistakes it may make, because we know the
mistakes it makes are ones that we would
make in the same position. I hope that when
the President of the United States comes here,
within the next couple of weeks, we shall
give him a royal welcome and show him
we are proud to be neighbours of his country.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Honourable senators,
on a question of privilege: I did not say,
either directly or indirectly, that Canada
should make contributions equal to those of
the United States on a dollar for dollar basis
without regard to our 17 million and their
150 million of population. What I said was
that we should contribute in proportion to
population or gross national production. I
was trying to make clear that just understandings make long friends.

SENATE
Hon. R. B. Horner: Honourable senators,
I will just take up your time for a moment
or two. I was very pleased that the honourable senator from Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr.
Roebuck) proposed some other method than
bombs as a possible way of solving the differences in the world today, and I thought I
would like to say a word as one who has
lived for the past 50 years with people who
came from what is now Russia and from
countries now dominated by Russia. Those
people love freedom just as we do. The
Scriptures tell us to gird ourselves for battle.
That means a moral girding for battle. We
have as well to seek the friendship of that
great number of people who we all hope will
some day, when they become educated, elect
a government. The honourable Leader of the
Opposition (Hon. Mr. Macdonald) in his very
able address mentioned the importance of
Parliament endorsing agreements such as this.
Of course that is important in Canada, where
each member of Parliament is responsible to
his constituency but of what effect would it
be in Russia, where there is but one candidate on the ballot, and no Opposition? We all
houe that some day the Russians will have
a different form of government from what
they have today.
There is one thing that I want te say
In my opinion the greatest
particularly.
thing that we in the Western world can
do is to demonstrate our superior way of
life. As I have said before, some day in
many countries which are now dominated
by a single dictator there may be great
changes. In the meantime we should demonstrate on every possible occasion that our
Western way of life is superior to theirs.
Hon. J. W. de B. Farris: Honourable senators, I did not intend to speak in this
debate and what I have to say will take but
a minute or two.
I feel somewhat akin to my honourable
friend from Winnipeg (Hon. Mr. Haig) who
has just described himself as being the last
survivor of the last Conservative Government in Manitoba. I am the last survivor in
British Columbia of the first Liberal Government in that province.
There is just one word that I have to
say as far as the financial features of this

tant, but there are times when things that
are donc are prompted only by an emergency and by the good will of those who
are associated together. It is my feeling that
the basis of this agreement is our common
loyalty and common necessity-that is the
measure of what each country is to do.

The only prospect I see for ultimate peace
is the ultimate preparation for that time,
and the biggest danger we may face is that
the time will come when the sense of urgency
and need of exerting every effort may fail
us. I have been reading a speech of mine
made in 1948-I was reading it for my own
edification, not with the intention of making
it to you again. At that time the Americans
had the bomb and the Russians did not have
it. Proposals were made to Russia for some
method of restricting the development of the
bomb; the Americans suggested that if there
could be some point of agreement all bombs
they had would be turned over to an international control body. The proposal broke up
on the question of inspection, when Stalin
said he would agree but that each country
must do its own inspecting on the honour
system.
On that occasion I told a story which perhaps bears repeating. I said it reminded me
of the Jew who got into a poker game with
a group he did net know, but who knew each
other very well. He was asked the next day
how ho made out in the game, and ho replied: "It was a funny game; it was on the
honour system. Each man declared his hand,
then threw it in with the cards face down."
"How did you make out?" his friend asked.
He said, "Well, I lost the first pot before I
knew the rules."
My speech, if anyone happens to be interested in looking at it, is found in the Senate
Hansard of 1948, beginning at page 151. Not
only did I make the speech in the Senate, but
I made it at an American Bar convention in
the United States, at a Board of Trade meeting in Vancouver, and at the Canadian Club
in Montreal. Finally, I quit making it because
I was accused of being a warmonger. But I
was simply saying that if we could net trust
the Russians to do anything when they did
not have the bomb, what chance would we
have when they had the bomb?
Now, there was net a public man in Canada,
the United States or Great Britain who did
not know as much as, and probably a great
deal more than, I did about that problem,
but they just would not face it. So we got no
discussion on making demands on Russia, at a
time when the United States had a power it
could have cnforced. I was told, "But the
Russians would invade Europe." My reply
was: "How long would such an invasion last
when the Americans had the bombs?" And
too, we then had the recent experience of
what happened in Hiroshima and Nagasaki
and how long those cities lasted against the
use of the bomb.
If the nations of the world on our side had
at that time demanded of Russia that it must
agree te the proposal of international control, that would have met the problem. But

SPEECH FROM THE THRONE
MOTION FOR ADDRESS IN REPLY-DEBATE
CONTINUED

The Senate resumed from Thursday, June
12, consideration of His Excellency the Governor General's Speech at the opening of the
session, and the motion of Hon. lMr. Monette,
seconded by Hon. Mr. Thorvaldson, for an
Address in reply thereto.
Hon. F. Elsie Inman: Honourable senators,
we have recently heard a great many expressions of congratulations in this chamber and
I would like to add mine to them. I wish
to extend my congratulations to the Honourable the Speaker on his reappointment to the
Chair. He has brought dignity and graciousness to the position, and we are delighted
to have him back to preside over our deliberations. I would also extend congratulations
to the honourable the Leader of the Government (Hon. Mr. Aseltine). His appointment
as Government Leader in the Senate is a
well-deserved honour, and I wish him a
pleasant and successful tenure of that important office. We are pleased to have back with
us the former Leader of the Government
(Hon. Mr. Haig), and we hope that he will
be with us for many long and happy years.
May I also congratulate the honourable
Leader of the Opposition (Hon. Mr. Macdonald) on his reappointment to that office.
He has always been an able, courteous and
understanding leader.
To the mover and seconder of the Address
in reply to the Speech from the Throne I
would also offer felicitations. Although I
was unavoidably absent from this chamber
when they spoke, I read their speeches in
Hansard, and I would commend them on upholding the high quality of Senate debates.
To those who have recently joined this chamber it gives me pleasure to extend a warm
welcome and best wishes for a long and
happy sojourn in the Senate of Canada.
57075-4-15j

Now for a few minutes I wish to speak
about some of the matters which concern us
down in the Maritimes, and especially in
Prince Edward Island. I would not like
honourable senators to forget that very important province.
A couple of weeks ago, on a Sunday evening, on television, there was a program
entitled "The Farmer". No doubt many of
you viewed this program, which took the
form of a trial. The farmer in the play was
the defendant, and he was endeavouring to
explain why it was necessary that so much
of the taxpayers' money should be allocated
to farmers in the form of bonuses, deficiency
payments and other forms of assistance. The
farmer worked up a very good case for himself. On the other hand, the prosecution had
convincing arguments. The farmer made one
statement which astonished me: it was to the
effect that the farmers of this country do not
have, nor can they have, much influence on
the Government, as their vote is so small. It
is true they may not have the majority vote
but if I am not mistaken they elected about
60 per cent of the members of Parliament.
That fact should certainly give them quite
an influence with the Government, and they
should receive consideration from Governments if and when required.
It is certainly true that many of our
farmers do need assistance in these days of
high operational costs. There is no doubt
about that, but it is also true that according
to the percentage of members they elect
they do wield considerable influence in Parliament. This power that they have could be
put to good use if it were directed to finding
means of getting our vacant farms rehabilitated and put back into production.
This applies to the Maritime provincesNew Brunswick, Nova Scotia and Prince
Edward Island-but especially to Prince
Edward Island, because we are an agricultural country.
At present there are agricultural surpluses
in Canada, particularly in wheat. At the
same time food prices have reached practically an all-time high, and still the Government is paying farmers deficiency payments,
as they call them, because the prices which
the farmer receives, without these defliciency
payments or financial assistance, are too low
to meet production costs. This to me is an
amazing economic situation. It is realized
that the Government has at the present
time a commission investigating price
spreads in the food industry, and perhaps
we shall have an explanation in the near
future. I am sure the citizens of Canada are
anxiously awaiting this explanation. In the
meantime many once productive acres are
rapidly becoming waste lands. Farms are

SENATE

being vacated and the land is being overgrown with weeds and scrub bush. I am
sure that this is not what our pioneer ancestors envisaged when they worked so hard
clearing the land.
We know that too many of the markets
for our produce have been lost on account
of tariffs and transportation costs. This is
most regrettable. I was pleased to learn,
however, that the Prime Minister intends
to open up again and restore our traditional
agricultural markets. This will be a very
welcome measure. It will mean that our
surpluses will be taken up and our farmers
will be encouraged to remain on their farms.
We need people, especially our young people, back on the land. It is a good life. There
is something that gives one a sense of wellbeing and freedom in the country air, in
the smell of the -earth, the grass and the
trees, and in the sound of a running brook
or the lapping of waves over sand.
Living close to the soil, planting, seeing
things grow, reaping the resulting harvestall the business of producing from the earth
instills in one a feeling of satisfaction, awe,
love and respect for the laws of nature.
It is hard work at times and the hours may
be long. It is not generally a business at
which fortunes can be quickly made. But
money is not all there is to life and it is
a mistake to think it is. I think it was Omar
Khayyam who said:
The worldly hope men set their hearts upon...
Lights but a littie hour and then is gone.

But there are other compensations in farm
life, and our Governments would do well to
promote interest in the business of producing from the soil in order to make this
industry attractive to young people for their
own sake and for the future of Canada. Aristotle said:
Every man was born to be a citizen.

To be a good citizen we must do all we possibly can for the welfare of our country and
our fellow citizens. To accomplish this we
must have faith, for faith is the one big
thing that will bring Canada to full development as a great nation with a great future.
And to quote Samuel Johnson:
Life is not long, and too much of it must not
pass in idle deliberation of how it shall be spent.

before if we are to cope with the changes
and events that happen so quickly due to
new inventions, nuclear energy, and discovcries in medical science and in all other
scientific fields. The old order has passed
away and education that was considered adequate even 20 years ago is now outdated
and inadequate to meet the requirements of
our present civilization. Our young people
must be equipped with a fund of knowledge
in order that they may meet life with the
training and outlook necessary to ensure success in whatever vocation they seek to enter.
It is therefore the duty of Governments to
take whatever steps are necessary to make
available to our young citizens, at the lowest
possible cost to parents and students, educational facilities at all levels. We hope our
present Government will do everything possible to this end.
Health is of course one of the most important pillars upon which we build our civilizations, for without due consideration to the
health and welfare of a nation, it can soon
deteriorate and perish.
I would like to go back to 1919 and reminisce for a moment or two. It was then
that the late Right Honourable Mr. King,
when he was chosen to be the Leader of the
Liberal party, outlined the health and welfare measures that we enjoy today. He even
had the plan for unemployment insurance
and for old age pensions on a contributory
basis. Through the years this program has
been implemented step by step as the need
arose. Now in a short time we shall have a
hospital insurance measure in operation.
Of course, we realize that from time to
time many of these social security and health
benefits were revised, and they will have to
be further revised as Canada grows and
expands nationally. But it is necessary to
plan carefully now, so that we shall be able
to recognize when the time has arrived to
make such changes.
Honourable senators, as I have said on
other occasions, Prince Edward Island produces the best potatoes and the finest oysters.
Now I wish to say that our lobsters are considered to have a better flavour and texture
than any others on this side of the Atlantic,
and I would go so far as to say on any side
of the Atlantic. I once asked a marine biologist
why this should be and he said it was due to
the type of food, water temperature and clean
seabed around our shores. I would like to
suggest, honourable senators, this is evidence
that the sea around Prince Edward Island is
superior to the sea around any other area.

We Canadians are very conscious of our
natural resources, and this is as it should be.
Our whole national economy is founded on
them. Our farm lands, minerais, forests,
fisheries and waterpower are all tied together
in one way or another, and for the full
development of these great gifts of nature
we must have intelligence, knowledge and

enterprise. To have these we must have
Hon. Mrs. Inman: Very good, I can assure
education, and certainly in this day and age
education is needed perhaps more than ever you.

JUNE 28, 1958
Lobsters will not travel unless the sea bottom is clean and free from slime. Lobster
fishing is one of the biggest industries in our
province. Our larger lobsters are shipped alive
and there is always a ready market and a
good price for them; but again transportation
is a factor, for lobsters must reach the market
before they begin to deteriorate. The opening
of the lobster season on the Island is quite
an event and is celebrated by the firing of
cannons, the blessing of boats, and other
ceremonies of interest to those concerned.
There is always a race among the fishermen
to see who can get their boats to the fishing
grounds first and run their lines. Those reaching there first get the choicest areas. Lobsters
frequent the same area year after year, so
the fishermen come to know the best places
to fish.
Now, I would like to say a few words with
regard to lobster hatcheries. The honourable
senator from Clare (Hon. Mr. Comeau) spoke
about this project recently in this chamber.
Between 1891 and 1917 fourteen lobster hatcheries were operated in the Maritimes by
the Department of Fisheries. Three of these
were operated in Prince Edward Island These
hatcheries were very interesting to visit, and
I remember that whenever we had guests we
used to take them there to see the process.
In artificial hatching, the female lobster with
eggs must be taken ashore. The eggs are then
scraped from the swimmerets and conveyed
to the hatchery and hatched out in jars. I
remember that when they went beyond what
we used to call the tadpole stage, they were
returned to the water and were on their own
from then on. But it was found that raising
lobsters from eggs and putting them out to sea
in this early stage created a high mortality
due to predators, the difficulty in finding food
quickly, and other reasons.
After a number of years in operation it
was apparently concluded that this "artificial
hatching" was of little or no value in increasing the population of marketable lobsters,
so the hatcheries were closed. In the 1930's
an "artificial rearing" station was established
in Maine. Statistical studies by Maine biologists seem to indicate that this procedure
could not be of importance to the lobster
fishing industry unless practised on a very
large scale, and it was uneconomic. However,
it does not appear that a really comprehensive
investigation of "artificial rearing" was ever
carried out in Canada. In view of the success
of the Oyster Experimental Station at Ellerslie, P.E.I., in assisting our oyster fishing industry, I suggest that a similar station should
be established in our province to study the
possibility of making lobster rearing profitable.
The conditions of water temperature, salinity
and sea bed are not the same in the Gulf of

St. Lawrence as off the Maine coast. Furthermore, I am sure that marine biologists must
have made great progress in their methods of
studying these things in the last forty years.
In any case, honourable senators, this important Maritime province source of income
should be fostered, and deserves the immediate attention of the department of fisheries.
Apart from the lobster canneries, we have
several fish-processing plants, but we need
more of these. To this the Government might
well give some thought. The Atlantic provinces are famous for the variety and quality
of their seafoods, and fish processing is certainly an industry that could be developed
to a greater extent in Prince Edward Island.
The Canadian housewife spends about one
quarter of the family budget on food, and
there is definitely not the percentage of this
amount being spent on fish that should be
spent. Education of our Canadian people, and
especially the housewife, in the art of properly
cooking and serving fish would undoubtedly
create a greater market for this economical,
nutritious and delicious vitamin-packed food.
Our fishermen catch many varieties of fish,
and there is no reason why our seafoods could
not be processed and placed on the markets
in greater quantities. This industry should
have more Government consideration and
support. It would bolster our economy and
provide employment for many of our people,
as well as improving the nutrition of the
people of Canada.
I feel that I cannot take my seat without
saying a word about tourism. The business
of tourism is one of the major industries in
the Maritime provinces, and in The Garden
of the Gulf it ranks second as an incomeproducing business. In a very few years it
might well be our most important industry.
Indeed, this could be the case in the whole
Atlantic area. Travel, in the name of pleasure,
for the purpose of seeing new places, or
revisiting favourite haunts, brings many
thousands of visitors yearly to our province.
It is not only the resort operators who profit
from the business of tourism. Investigation
shows that only about 17 per cent of the
tourist dollar is spent for lodging; the remainder is spent among all the other types
of businesses and associated services.
Perhaps the Canadian public in the past
has not been aware of, or did not really
appreciate, the value of the tourist industry,
for there has been a lack of interest among
our citizens with regard to its promotion. The
coser we look at the past, in the field of
economic values, the closer we must look at
the present and ask ourselves what the future
holds for Canada's hospitality industry, especially as it applies to the Maritime provinces.

of the tourist industry to our country. Unrest
in other parts of the world, particularly in
Europe, provides the opportunity to make
Canadian tourism into a big business. If we
do not take advantage of the opportunities
presented to us we will find ourselves trailing
sadly behind those countries which have accepted that challenge, and this neglect will
cost us millions annually in lost tourist
revenue.
We must have co-operation at the federal
and provincial levels and find new ways to
build up and strengthen this business if it is
to go forward. We have the natural facilities,
lots of room, diversity in recreation and
scenery.
We need unity; that is the biggest issue
at the moment in this country. In looking
to the future we must approach it as a united
nation, working as one great unit for the
good of Canada in our time and for the
years that lie ahead.

PRIVATE BILL
TRANS MOUNTAIN OIL PIPE LINE COMPANYSECOND READING
Hon. Stanley S. McKeen moved the second
reading of Bill S-6, respecting Trans Mountain
Oil Pipe Line Company.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Explain please.
Hon. Mr. McKeen: Honourable senators,
perhaps if I had not risen so quickly the bill
would have been passed without an explanation. However, since I have been asked to
explain I had better do so.
This is a measure that has already been
explained in the Senate. It is one that I have
every confidence in bringing before this house
because of all the pipe line bills that have
ever been brought forward on the North
American continent this is one that I think
can stand all the light that can be focused
on it and come out with flying colours. This
bill is different from some other pipe line
bills in the fact that it is not a promotion
in the regular sense of the word. The promoters of this pipe line originally were a
group of oil companies who were endeavouring to find cheaper transportation from the
well-head to the refineries or to seaboard, and
they engaged an engineering firm, the Bechtel
Corporation, to carry out an economic and
physical survey of the area to see where the
line should be built.

Honourable senators will remember that at
that time there was a great deal of discussion
on where the pipe line should be built. Many
of the lines in that area were being laid
partly in Canada and partly in the United
States, and then coming back into Canadian
territory. The demand at the west coast
particularly was that this pipe line should be
built wholly in Canada, and after supplying
the needs of Canada the company was to be
free to serve customers across the international border.
May I say that this pipe line complied with
that demand: it was laid in British Columbia
territory, down to the border, and from there
it was extended to serve Washington, Oregon
and California, though as it has turned out the
oil taken by California is being transported
there from Vancouver by tanker.
As I say, this pipe line was built for the
benefit of the oil producers who stood to
get a better price for their oil or sell more
oil because of cheaper transportation. Also,
it would provide a cheaper supply of oil
for processors, refineries and exporters, as
well as giving a return to investors. This
has worked out very well. Just a short
while ago the Merrill Foundation in the
United States made a survey of all pipe
lines on this continent, and it selected Trans
Mountain Pipe Line as the ideal model for
the building and financing of pipe lines.
In some pipe lines the major oil companies
hold control and the throughput is restricted
to their oil. In this particular case the
major oil companies took shares in the company. It allocated 250,000 shares to the
independent oil companies and sold shares
to the general public as well. So the general public, the smaller oil companies and
the major ou companies all participated in
this stock.
I have some figures here which might be
of interest in regard to the shareholdings
of this company. They show that there are
5,396 independent Canadian shareholdersthat is the general publie-as against 618
shareholders among the major Canadian companies. The shareholders in the United States
number only 1,077, representing a total of
only 289,000 shares owned outside Canada.
So out of a total of 1,500,000 shares, it is
apparent that in this particular case there
are large holdings in Canada enjoying the
profits of this Canadian resource.
In promotions of this kind it is usual
for promoters to get a certain amount of
stock at a preferred price, because they are
gambling on the success of the undertaking.
In this case, however, the promoters paid
$10 a share for their stock, exactly the same
price at which it was sold to the general
public. Out of 1,500,000 shares there were

SENATE
only 450,000 shares that did not bring $10
each into the treasury. These were shares
that were underwritten by a group of brokerage houses, which made only 50 cents a
share, an unusually low charge for that type
of promotion. The general public paid $10
and the original promoters paid $10 for their
shares, and there were no shares sold at
a lower price.
Up to the present time another 4,900 shares
have been sold under an incentive plan to
employees of the company, not for $10 a
share but $38.75 a share, because under the
terms of the plan, any shares sold to officials,
officers or employees of the company are
bought by them at the market price on the
day they exercised their option, and when the
options were exercised the price happened to
be $38.75.
Honourable senators, the hour is getting
late and I will not go further into the details
of the formation of the company; but I would
like to say something about this particular
bill, which has for its object a subdividing
of the common stock of the company. The
purpose of the bill is to give the company
authority to subdivide its shares five shares
for one. There was a lot of feeling that this
would give something free to the shareholders. Nothing could be farther from the
truth. There are at present issued 1,500,000
shares, which represent all the common stock
equity in the company. If this bill is passed
the company will have authority to convert
those 1,500,000 shares into 7,500,000 shares,
which will mean exactly the same thing.
May I illustrate what will happen if this
bill passes? If you took a $50 bill to the bank
and said you wanted to change it for five
$10 bills you would in effect be doing the
same thing as the company proposes to do
with its shares, namely, to give five shares
for one with the same total value. If this were
a regular stock deal which did not have to
come to Parliament for legislative permission,
the company would merely apply to the
Registrar of Joint Stock companies for a subdivision of its shares. If I might put it another way: if I give you a $50 note in payment of a debt, and then came along later and
say that I would like to substitute five $10
notes for the one $50 note, you would find it
a little easier to deal with the five notes;
they would be more useful to you than the
one note.
The reason this company wants to subdivide its shares is that it may have to issue
some more equity stock when it is increasing
the capacity of the pipe line. The intention
is to parallel the present 24-inch pipe line
with a 30-inch pipe line. That may mean the
issuing of more equity stock, and it will be
easier for the company to issue stock at $10

a share than at, say, $50 a share; it means
that the smaller investors will be able to
participate. The idea behind the proposal
is to have the investment in this pipe line
divided as far and as widely in this country
as possible, and that is the only purpose of
this bill. There will be no other benefit to the
company than a greater marketability of its
shares. Five new shares instead of one old
share does not represent any greater value;
this is not a stock bonus or the giving away
of free stock. Indeed, this is the most worthwhile promotion that has ever been made,
as far as I know, in the pipe line field. Not
one share is being sold to any of the promoters at a price lower than that sold to
the general public.
With those remarks, honourable senators,
may I say if this bill receives second reading
I will move that it be referred to the Standing
Committee on Transport and Communications.
Motion agreed to and bill read second time.

REMOVAL OF FLAG FROM SENATOR'S
OFFICE WINDOW
QUESTION OF PRIVILEGE

On the Orders of the Day:
Hon. Vincent Dupuis: Honourable senators,
before the Orders of the Day are proceeded
with I wish to raise a question of privilege.
I would like to know from the Law Clerk of
the Senate or from the distinguished Clerk of
the Senate upon what grounds a member of
the Senate is not allowed to display a flag
from the window of his own office in the
Parliament Building. If there is a law that
regulates such action, what is it?
Just before the Senate was called this
evening I went to dinner, but before doing so
I took it upon myself to hang from my window
the model of a fiag that was sent to me by
Mr. Nelson, an officer of the Canadian Army
during the last war. When he arrived on the
continent of Europe in World War II he
wrote me that the Canadian Army,-which,
by the way, had the reputation of being composed of brave soldiers-was not identifiable
by the French civil population, and he asked
if I could not have a fiag designed according to
a description he gave me. This description
specified a maple leaf in the upper left-hand
corner and as many horizontal stripes as there
are provinces in Canada, the stripes being red,
blue and white.
I did exactly what he asked me to do.
Furthermore, I obtained a copyright of the
design. The flag was displayed before the
Commons Committee on the Canadian Flag,
and it was left there as part of the committee's
records. Seeing that there were so many flags
displayed this afternoon on the occasion we
are celebrating today-Canada Day, Confederation Day or, as some of our good friends of
British origin call it, Dominion Day-I
thought I would display that flag from my
office window in the Parliament Buildings.
As a lawyer, and having some knowledge
of Parliamentary laws, I always felt, honourable senators, that a member of Parliament,
either of the Lower House or the Upper House,
when in his office in the Parliament Buildings
was in the county or district which he has the
honour to represent here, so I thought that
57075-4-16

when I was in my own office I was as if I
were in the senatorial district of Rigaud.
I displayed that flag for the purpose of
letting the crowds assembled on Parliament
Hill see it. However, it appears that when I
was at dinner someone removed the flag from
my window. I do not know who it was, but
the flag disappeared and I do not know where
it is now.
I would like to know from the Law Clerk
of the Senate if there is any law which forbids
a member of Parliament from displaying a
flag, not necessarily of his own choice but one
that night or might not ever be chosen as
the Canadian flag?
The Hon. the Speaker: On the question of
privilege raised by the honourable senator
from Rigaud (Hon. Mr. Dupuis), I rule that
a question cannot be put directly to the Law
Clerk and have him answer in the Senate.
Such a question should be put to the honourable Leader of the Government, who I
am sure would take the honourable senator's
rernarks as a notice of inquiry, and perhaps
give a satisfactory answer.
I am, like my honourable friend, a lawyer,
but I am not an expert on constitutional
matters. My friend is perhaps more learned
in the law than I am, but I never heard of
any extraterritorial rights such as he suggests.
I suggest, therefore, that the question be
put to the Leader of the Government in the
Senate, who may accept it as a notice of
inquiry.
Hon. Mr. Dupuis: Your Honour, I am
pleased to have your advice in the matter,
but I do not regard myself as one learned
in the constitutional law of this country. I do
not regard myself as an expert.
I accept Your Honour's advice and I ask
the question of the Leader of the Government by way of an inquiry. I know very
well that in the sanctuary of Parliament a
member of either bouse cannot be charged
with a crime and cannot be arrested, but I
do not know if one can assimilate this with
the question of extraterritorial rights.
SPEECH FROM THE THRONE
MOTION FOR ADDRESS IN REPLY-DEBATE
CONTINUED

The Senate resumed from Thursday, June
26, consideration of His Excellency the
Governor General's speech at the opening of
the session, and the motion of Hon. Mr.
Monette, seconded by Hon. Mr. Thorvaldson, for an Address in reply thereto.
Hon. Calvert C. Pratt: Honourable senators,
I wish to be included among those who, in
speaking to this motion, have expressed their
appreciation of the splendid leadership given

SENATE
in this debate by the mover and the seconder,
and also to record my hearty congratulations,
as others have done, to the Honourable the
Speaker for the fine service he is rendering
to Parliament. I would like also to extend
a hearty welcome to our new members and
hope they may all be able to render, for many
years, valuable service in this Senate of
Canada.
In thinking over what one might usefully
say in the debate on the Speech from the
Throne I always find the subjects of bewildering variety, any one of which is sufficient for one address. Matters of great
importance to the development of Canada
are mentioned in the Speech now under
review. Some of them have been the subject
of legislation and have had close analysis in
committee and in this chamber. The provision for more housing throughout Canada, the
amendment of the Unemployment Insurance
Act, hospital insurance and some other
features of the Speech have already been
dealt with. The indication of a program for
the expansion of trade to be promoted by the
forthcoming Commonwealth Trade Conference is, of course, of outstanding importance.
I hope there will be opportunities in this
bouse for members to deal with the matter
and bring it under a very full survey. Linked
with the policy of commonwealth trade
should be the closest possible consideration of
our international trade position generally,
because, valuable as is the trade of the commonwealth, it will always play a lesser part
in the sum-total of world trade by which
Canadian people have to live. When I say
that, I don't minimize in the slightest degree
the value of commonwealth trade nor the
importance of the effort to promote it in
proper relation to our foreign trade generally.
The Speech from the Throne has reference
to broader efforts being under consideration
for the sale of agricultural and fishery products in the markets of the world. It refers
also to support prices that have been established for a considerable number of agricultural products. I hope that the wide view
expressed of the need for agricultural development will extend in a full measure to
the fisheries also.
I want to use this opportunity to bring out
a matter which is of very great importance,
in fact of vital importance to the province of
Newfoundland. It is that a major branch of
the fishing industry which produces the salted
cod is running up to a crisis. Sometimes
people are apt to look at the importance of an
industry from the point of view of the
relative numbers of dollars recorded by the
Bureau of Statistics. I prefer to place the
first importance in respect to the number of

people who are affected by an industry and
whose living is derived directly from it. The
official records show that in 1957 Newfoundland had 16,400 men employed at the fisheries. Of this number, 4,400 were supplying
the fresh fish plants and 12,000 were what is
termed salt cod fishermen. Actually the salt
fish branch provides the foundation for the
whole fishing industry of our province. It is
that phase of the industry which is very precarious, and it is rapidly declining. I can
truthfully say that in the Newfoundland
economy there is nothing else to take its
place. Apart from its established value, it
acts as a buffer in the ups and downs of employment in other industries. That alone has
immense importance in a land of scattered
population and limited variety of employment. In a moment I shall refer in greater
detail to the problems of this particular industry, but first I would like to make some
reference to the fishing operations generally.
Around the coastline of Newfoundland and
out to the south and east of our province
is one of the most prolific fishing areas of
the world. I say that while keeping in mind
our good friends in this chamber from British
Columbia. Codfish, in varying areas and for
varying periods in the summer, flow in to
the shores in such huge bodies that the quantities caught are insignificant in relation to
the immediate supply. While we have the
production of many types of fish, such as
salmon, lobsters, herring and some others,
the productive value of these is low in relation to the ground fish, which is made up of
cod, haddock and other varities.
This particular industry falls within two
categories. There is the frozen fish, which is
largely fillets exported from Newfoundland
almost entirely to the United States, there
being no other market. I might say here that
the Canadian market is supplied almost exclusively by plants on the mainland. They
can load their product on railway cars or in
refrigerated trucks for distribution to customers. Newfoundland plants would have to
supply their product in much larger unit
shipments by steamship transportation to
cold storage warehouses at the ports of
arrival, and thus run distribution costs up
much higher than those of the producing
plants in the other Atlantic provinces.
When we consider the fisheries of Newfoundland we are compelled to think entirely
in terms of export trade and not of partial
domestic trade such as other operations in
eastern Canada enjoy. This is one of the
considerations which must always be borne in
mind by those in authority when dealing with
the export problems of my province.
I would mention for a moment the subject
of transportation for our fishery products

JULY 1, 1958
and in particular the closing down of the
Canadian National Steamship operations to
the West Indies. The West Indies are now
the biggest markets for these exports. Representation had been made for the diversion
of those boats to a Newfoundland port en
route to the West Indies. The public were
expecting a favourable response when the
stoppage came. With Newfoundland's disadvantage in catering to the domestic trade
of Canada for fish there was no reason why
a public service should not provide Newfoundland shippers with the same rates as
Nova Scotia shippers had for the same product
to the same markets. It is a deplorable fact
that that opportunity has been lost by the
complete cancellation of that service because
of a prolonged strike, and now it appears
that the boats will probably pass out of
public ownership. The Newfoundland fish
export trade, in the circumstances, is certainly
entitled to a direct allowance by the Government which will equalize freight rates to
the West Indies from Newfeundland ports
with those from Nova Scotia.
I, personally, feel there are grounds also
for consideration of a compensation policy
that will offset the freight cost disadvantage
of other branches of the industry as well,
both in the domestic market and abroad.
I would like now to give honourable senators some detailed information concerning
the salt fish industry of my province, and
to deal particularly with its competitive position with other producing countries.
This industry was started shortly after
the discovery of Newfoundland in 1497 and
had been prosecuted by English and other
European fishermen for centuries. In fact it
was the first product of trade from the
Western Hemisphere to Europe. One feature
of the industry is that the fishermen who
catch the fish for salting live in hundreds
of places around the coast, where they are
both the catchers and curers, and if they
cannot cure by salting they simply are
prevented from fishing. I stress that fact
because it is really the basis for some of
the points I shall make later on as to why
this industry needs assistance. It has been
proven time and again, and most obviously
this year, that it is of great importance as
a protection against unemployment in other
industries. For instance, this year there has
been a big falling off of employment by the
paper mills in their woods operations. The
Federated Fishermen's Organization has indicated that chiefly for this reason 1,500
to 2,000 men have come back to the fshery
this year and have thus taken up some of
the vacuum created by lack of employment
in other directions. If that is the case, we

shall have around 18,000 fishermen altogether
this season, of whom possibly 13,000 will be
catching and salt-curing cod. That feature
has a double value, as a matter of fact,
because while it is a natural source of
employment when other occupations fall off,
it at the same time enables fishermen to
continue as fishermen, for it is obvious to
everyone that if our men lose their contact
with the sea, and thereby lose their adaptability to wrestle with the problems of the
sea, they will be ocean fishermen no longer.
Such maintenance of the fishing population
is of the utmost importance for future development of the industry in Newfoundland.
The precarious nature of the salt fish
industry at this time, as I have said, is
causing alarm. The quantity exported in
1949 was 55,800 tons, which was about the
annual average over the previous twenty
years. In 1957 the export tonnage on the
same basis of cured weight was 32,500 tons,
a drop of 23,300 tons in eight years.
Five years ago, when making an address
in this chamber on Newfoundland fishery
problems, I stated that while the world
production of salted cod and other fish similar
to ours had increased in the previous three
years by 30 per cent, the Newfoundland
production had decreased in the same period by 18j per cent. Since that time world
production has further increased, whereas
since 1949 Newfoundland production has
decreased by 42 per cent. There are people
who should know better who adopt a defeatist attitude towards this salt fish industry. They say it is dying, anyway, that
its only customers are the poor of humanity,
and so forth. Nothing is further from the
truth. The industry will die only if we do
not gear ourselves to the competition, as
I shall shortly indicate.
There is a growing demand in the markets
of the world for the salt fish product; and, as
for the class of customers, where is there
better buying power in North and South
America-if we except the United States and
Canada-than in Puerto Rico, Cuba, Jamaica,
Brazil and such countries? And if we except
the United Kingdom, where is there better
buying capacity in Europe than in Spain,
Italy, Portugal and Greece? The salt fish
consumer markets I have indicated are just
representative of foreign trade generally in
the Americas and in Europe-no more, no
less.
Here are some figures that should impress
one as to the world importance of the product.
European and Canadian production of salted
cod and related types has gone up from
306,000 tons in 1948 to 460,000 tons in 1956.
That constitutes a big industry for any group
of countries and shows a total increase of

SENATE
50 per cent in that short time--from 1948 to
1956-while the Canadian portion of that
production, chiefly that of Newfoundland,
dropped by 42 per cent.
While considering this tremendous world
growth of the salt fish trade it will be interesting to know that in 1953 salted fish
of the type I refer to from Canada was 15.2
per cent of the value of all Canadian fish
exports, while in 1957 it dropped to 9 per
cent. All Canadian fish exports showed an
increase in 1957 over 1953 of $28 million,
but the salt fish export value decreased in
that time by $4,360,000.
In this connection I think it will be interesting if I give sorne facts about European
fishery operations for salted fish in waters
adjacent to Newfoundland, and I do not need
to repeat that I am referring to the same
type of salted fish throughout my remarks.
Portugal alone had 54 vessels fishing on the
Grand Banks of Newfoundland this year.
Those boats used Newfoundland ports, chiefiy
St. John's, as servicing centres. It was reported in the press that at one time this spring
there were 2,500 Portuguese sailors in St.
John's. Incidentally, I might say they are
very welcome and they generally prove to
be very law-abiding visitors. The production
of salt fish by the Portuguese fishing fleet
in 1957 was 68,500 tons. This was 70 per cent
of the quantity used in local consumption
in Portugal. They have a program for increasing their production for the years 1959 to
1964 to 85 per cent of their total consumption.
I am giving these facts because I want
to bring out, if I may, the importance that
other countries, progressive countries, put on
this industry, while we in our part of the
world seem to be forgetting about it.
The Spanish fleet of fishing boats in 1956
consisted of 58 units: 28 trawlers and 30 pairs
of smaller boats, operating in units of two.
They produced altogether in terms of dry
weight slightly less than 42,000 tons. The
French fishing fleet in 1957 consisted of 37
trawlers and produced 58,000 tons. French
boats, while serne visit Newfoundland ports for
servicing, chiefly call at St. Pierre, Miquelon,
for their harbouring facilities. While the
waters adjacent te Newfoundland are a chief
fishing area for those fleets, they extend their
operations to the vicinity of Greenland and
Iceland as well. It is an interesting comparison that the total production of salted fish
by the fishermen of Newfoundland last year
was about 32,500 tons, while the Portuguese,
Spanish and French fishermen, who use the
waters adjacent to Newfoundland as one of
their principal sources of operation, produced
150,000 tons. That tonnage figure is calculated
on the same dry weight basis as that of the
Newfoundland production.

Hon. Mr. Hugessen: May I ask the honourable senator a question? Where do these
Portuguese, Spanish and French fishermen do
their salting?
Hon. Mr. Prat: Right on the boats.
I have dealt so far with the production of
three countries, only one of which, France,
is a competitor in our foreign markets. The
other two, Portugal and Spain, produce this
product chiefly for their own consumption,
and, notwithstanding their big figures of
production, are valuable customers of other
producing countries.
I would now like to place on record some
facts concerning the volume of production
and the production methods, as well as the
policy of the Governments of other producing
countries towards their salt fish industry;
and I would state again that when I refer
to salt fish I refer only to fish of types
comparative to those produced by Newfoundland fishermen. The expert volume of this
food, as I said, ranks well up among the
important products of world trade.
The chief competitors of Newfoundland
for this product in the foreign markets are
Iceland, Norway, France and Denmark. The
various forms of assistance given in those
countries is of tremendous interest. While
the forms of assistance vary with each country, the general effect on their industry is
not very dissimilar. If I may, I will give
seme brief details.
France pays an exporting subsidy equal
te about $3.50 per hundredweight.
Norway has various means of assisting,
which includes direct subsidies in units of
production to fishermen, subsidies to processors and exporters, as well as contributions
to cost of fishing gear.
The United Kingdom, whose product is
used mostly for local consumption, has subsidies both for vessels on a daily basis of
operation and on a production basis for cod
and other ground fish, which would approximate $3 per hundredweight on our driedweight basis of calculation.
Those subsidies which I have mentioned
are the equivalent of about 30 per cent of
the average prices paid to fishermen at the
points of production in Newfoundland.
Denmark and the Faroe Islands are in the
process of financing large new fishing boats,
which will be actually freezing and processing
plants, to the amount of 37 million kroner,
half of which, by the way, comes from the
Faroe Islands' Marshall Aid fund.
Iceland, which is one of our leading conpetitors, gives the greatest direct assistance
to their fishing fleets. The Icelandic Government paid to owners of trawlers which operated in the iced fish industry 4,000 kroners,
or the equivalent of £88 sterling per day for

JULY 1 1958
each boat. For each trawler whose product
was locally processed the payment was £110
sterling per day; and for trawlers that produced salted fish which is sold in competition
with our salted product, £133 sterling, or
about $360, per day for each boat. Boats built
since 1949 were given an extra daily subsidy
of the equivalent of £13 because of higher
capital costs. There is also a subsidy toward
fuel costs. Subsidies for motorboat fishermen,
plants and fish as exported went well over
the equivalent of £4 million sterling. The
total subsidies in Iceland for their fisheries
approximated £8 million sterling in 1957. It
seems incredible, but it is a fact, that the
Icelandic Government has announced direct
subsidies for the industry that in 1958 will
bring the total subsidies to approximately
80 per cent of the value of the product. No
one in his senses would advocate that the
Canadian Government follow the extremes
of such a policy, but I think it is only right
and of interest to us all to bring these facts
out, when today we are facing a very acute
problem in the industry.
One naturally asks: How can they do it?
Well, they have American aid which they
divert to the industry. Notwithstanding that,
they have imposed a circle of tariffs and other
taxes to a degree that has caused serious
inflation and may be nullifying to a great
extent the local advantages which had been
anticipated for such trade promotions.
It is very evident that the trade promotion
policies of the various countries which I have
outlined cannot be ignored, otherwise we shall
just be saying to the people of Europe-and,
indeed, to Asia, in time-"Come over and take
the fish from our shores. We in Newfoundland
can do nothing with them, except" and let
me repeat "what we can sell to the United
States of the fresh and frozen product." The
imponderable there is: When will the United
States tariff change again, and when wil
the United States be reconsidering quotas?
A feature of particular interest to Canada
that I would like to mention, and one incidental to all this, although not entirely arising out of it, is a situation in the fish exports
from Canada-principally Newfoundland and
Nova Scotia-to Jamaica. On a previous
occasion I mentioned what appeared to be
an impending break in a continuous trade
relationship over the years. An immediate
contract, however, was made with Jamaica at
the time and a cut-off avoided. In November
of last year the Jamaican Government trade
control authority asked the Newfoundland
Fish Export Organization for a firm contract

price for shipment of all Jamaican requirements of salted fish, from July up to the end
of this year. It may be significant that this
inquiry came to Newfoundland some months
before the new season's production commenced. Deliveries had to be of new production, of course. It was very difficult to guess
at a value for fish still swimming in the ocean.
Anyway, as demanded, a price was submitted
and the result was that the contract went to
Iceland, notwithstanding the fact that the
Icelandic shipments were not to commence
until seven months later. The value of salt
fish exports from Canada, mostly of Newfoundland production, to Jamaica, has been
averaging around $2.5 million per year. Prices
at which sales have been made to Jamaica,
and, of course, to the West Indies generally,
have varied very little for years and have
not gone up in line with the increased cost of
production.
I bring this matter to the attention of the
Senate not by any means for the purpose of
inviting a threat from our officials, but very
definitely to help guide their thoughts in the
matter of trade policy. It is time that such
a country running a very favourable trade
balance with Canada should be more strongly
reminded that trade has mutual considerations. The trading position between Canada
and Jamaica is that in 1956 our imports from
that country were to the value of $24,600,000,
and our exports $17,200,000. In 1957 Canada's imports from Jamaica amounted to $40
million and our sales to that country were
$19,400,000. Surely a favourable trade balance in favour of our Jamaican friends of
$28 million in two years is worth taking
notice of. It is a fact that the livelihood of
a large number of Canadians, whose sole
occupation is fishing, cannot and will not be
ignored in such matters of foreign trade
policy.
Honourable senators, I have not put all
this calculating and tabulating effort into the
preparation of this talk just in order to put
figures on record. I must thank you for
your patience in listening to it. I assure you
that there is a very definite need to provide
more facts on our fishing industry than are
readily available and to give them greater
publicity so as to stimulate an interest in
getting a progressive program. There has
always been a very strong interlocking of
producer interests between the various divisions of our fishing industry, but in the past
the necessary attention has not been given
to a well-rounded-out policy which would
advance its many divisions in proper relation one to the other. As I have already
intimated, the one getting the least attention
but engaging about 70 per cent of the fishermen is the salted fish branch.

SENATE
I might say that in Newfoundland we have
what I consider is a very fine setting for
stimulating improvement if a well laid-out
policy were available. First, there is a well
organized and progressive Federation of
Fishermen Organization, which is most
anxious to co-operate.
There are some
active fishermen's co-operatives. Then there
is an exporters' financing and marketing
body, which is ready to extend and interlock
its activities. Also there are government
fishery departments, both federal and provincial, which are anxious to be of greater
service. With all that there is unfortunately
a lack of well co-ordinated effort between
the various interests.
At this point I would like to mention a
matter which I think is of extreme importance, that of the application of practical
research within the industry. We have the
services of research stations and tremendous
progress is possibly being made in the theoretical field as well as possibly in the practical
field applying to the supply of fish and the
movements of fish in the ocean and such
matters. I like to think of research in its
application to our fisheries as being a major
factor between the producer and the consumer. That calls for devising means not
only for better preservation and improvements in the present day article, but doing
everything possible to appeal to the shopper
in the supermarket as well as to cause increasing demand from the family as they sit
around the dinner table. The world, it is
said, practically lives out of cans, but we
hardly know the appearance of one in relation to any branch of the Newfoundland fishing industry. Industrial research by great
industry in the United States, for example,
bas in the past generation converted the
products of the land and the sea into a
thousand new articles. It is time our government research institutions got down to a program of encouraging industry to create
products that will help the producer and the
processor to make a living.
In respect to our existing salt fish industry
again, the fishermen need encouragement to
take a greater interest in quality and to cure
the types that are most acceptable and will
bring the highest return in the markets. As
that proceeds we need strict enforcement of
practical grading regulations, both at the time
the product changes hands locally and when
packed for export. Unquestionably, the conditions at this time call for the application

of subsidies or floor prices and such forms
of assistance to save the industry as are now
applicable to a large number of agricultural
products. Each one of these subsidies or floor
price arrangements came into being when
the affected industry badly needed help, as
the salt fish trade now does. This assistance
should be in the form that will result in
fishermen getting higher returns for better
quality, and there should be the greatest care
to produce the grades that will command
the highest prices in the foreign markets. In
some foreign countries, for specialized types,
there are prices available that are beyond
anything now being obtained for the product
exported. The greatest effort needs to be
made to keep our product moving in the
traditional markets, such as Brazil and others,
particularly where the balance of trade is
favourable, as it is now with Brazil, but
where exchange difficulties are blocking
sales.
Finally, honourable senators, I might say,
the whole industry needs a forward-looking
plan with a competent supervising agency
which can co-operate fully with all the interests involved, and I am sure that, with a
reasonable measure of direction and encouragement, there will be a loyal response by
the Newfoundland fishermen, and all others
concerned.
Hon. Jean-François Pouliot: Honourable
senators, I understand that the debate on
the Address is about to conclude, and I am
very happy to have the privilege of speaking
in this debate.
Before coming to my main remarks I wish to
congratulate the Leader of the Government
(Hon. Mr. Aseltine) on his appointment,
which he deserves in every way. Up until
now he has been very fair and helpful to
his colleagues, and I have no doubt that
be will continue in that good mood. In that
respect I wish to support very strongly the
suggestion made by the honourable senator
from Cochrane (Hon. Mr. Bradette), that
the Leader of the Government in the Senate
should be called to join the cabinet in the
capacity of a Privy Councillor. It would
be much more convenient for us, because
whenever we had a question to ask the
honourable leader he would be in a better
position to answer; he would have a background for his answers from discussions with
his colleagues within the precincts of the
Council Room.

Canadian Pacific Railway is the only bondholder.
All these railways are under the jurisdiction of the Board of Transport Commissioners, and all are operated by the Canadian

it will not go through the subsidiary companies.
Hon. Mr. Farris: Will this involve legal

legal fees at all.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: Will they write off the

Hon. Mr. Bouffard: They will write off the
capital investment, and increase the properties

Hon. Mr. McKeen: Does this have anything

Hon. Mr. Bouffard: Nothing at all with
cutting out service. The lines will be operated
as before.
Hon. Mr. Taylor (Wesimorland): May I ask
the honourable senator a question? One of
the railways referred to in section 2 of the
bill is the New Brunswick Southern Railway
Company. Could the honourable senator tell
me what railway that is?
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: It is a small stretch of
railway extending from Bay Shore in New
Brunswick to Saint George, a distance of
about 46.1 miles. I have a map here showing
that line which I could show my honourable
colleague either now or after the house
adjourns.
Hon. Mr. Taylor (Wesimorland): As I
understand it, there is a line of railway
running from Saint John to Saint Stephen.
Is the New Brunswick Southern a section of
that line? I am wondering why just one
section of that line is being dealt with.
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: Yes, it is a section of
that railway line running out of Saint Johna small branch line, 46.1 miles long-which
is in operation and will continue in operation
until it becomes unnecessary. If in future it
becomes unnecessary the company will have
to seek permission of the Board of Transport
Commissioners to cease its operation.

The Senate resumed from yesterday consideration of His Excellency the Governor
General's speech at the opening of the session, and the motion of Hon. Mr. Monette,
seconded by Hon. Mr. Thorvaldson, for an
Address in reply thereto.
Hon. Cyrille Vaillancouri: Honourable senators, I address my first words to our most

I also wish to pay my respects to you,

that it is no burden to repeat these compliments, particularly when they are addressed to someone as worthy as you.

slump, the American government asked
Bernard Baruch to express his opinion on
the matter and to propose ways of restoring
the nation's economy. Mr. Baruch explained
his views before the Senate Finance Committee in Washington. The leaders of the
day had their own opinion and they did not
listen to economist Baruch's advice when he
said that, in his view, inflation was the
biggest threat to the nation. Twenty-five
years later, the same Baruch offers the same
advice and he has not changed his mind
about that matter. It is important, he says,
to balance the budget, to reduce public
expenditures, to stop giving right and left
more money than we receive, to refrain
from exhausting revenue sources and thus,
to prevent an inflation that could be disastrous. Mr. Baruch will not be listened to
any more today than he was then; however,
if his advice had been followed in 1933,
the present situation might be quite different.
According to some economists, the Government should, in order to cope with unemployment, undertake large projects; according to others, it should reduce taxes.
Twenty-five years ago, the economists were
of opinion that a depression was no time
for governments to launch large public works
which only increased the public debt. When
you spend more than you make, you go
bankrupt.
The Speech from the Throne mentioned
that the Government will grant $300 million
to speed up the housing program. That,
to my mind, is a practical way of curing
unemployment for it not only requires all
kinds of construction material but also calls
for the services of carpenters and many
other kinds of labour. Important government
projects affect only certain areas where they
are centralized, while housing construction
is spread over the whole country. Indeed,
housing construction, directly or indirectly,
reaches all our trades. As the saying goes:
When construction is thriving, business is
thriving.
I do not claim that those who do not agree
with me are in the wrong; I have simply
stated certain facts, to throw some light on
the situation and to help solve our problem.
I would also like to refer to a matter
which is of particular interest to me and
which I want to draw to the Government's
attention. Last week, I met several Canadians
who had just returned from Brussels. These
businessmen had visited the World's Fair
and, in particular, the Canadian pavillon.
They were a bit disappointed, not so much
with the pavilion itself as with the propaganda which is being dispensed there. A
Belgian friend of mine told me: "Had I never
seen Canada, I would believe that Canada

is a small country, which bas just come into
existence and is just beginning to be known
abroad."
At the sight of the many posters showing
Indians and Eskimos, my Canadian friends
asked the people in charge of the various
booths how many Eskimos there were in
Canada. One young girl replied that there
were at least two million of them. As there
are many more Indians in Canada than
Eskimos, that leaves very little room for
the white people.
"As it was dinner time," said another visitor to the Fair, "my friends and I decided to
have some typically Canadian dishes at the
Canadian pavilion. You might not believe
me, but we were given some adulterated
maple syrup bought from the United States."
Now, I happen to know that some maple
syrup had been shipped from Canada for the
Brussels Fair as early as last February. I
got in touch with Antwerp, and I learned
that that maple syrup had been lying on the
docks for three months.
I wish to draw the attention of the Government to that state of affairs, in order that
they might correct it. Personally, I do not
blame the Minister of Trade and Commerce,
but if he is made aware of the facts, he will
no doubt intervene without delay to remedy
the situation.
The mover of the Address said:
Nevertheless, the most imperative duty of governments is to watch over the physical and moral
conservation of its human capital.

That is why I refer again to a topic on
which I made some comments last year,
namely, pernicious publications. Please note
that I do not simply say obscene publications; I refer to all that filthy literature which
corrupts, kills or teaches how to kill, to
commit rape, and so on. The Minister of
Justice, who dealt with the matter last year,
tells us that the Criminal Code is going to
be amended in order that the word obscene
be clearly defined. So much the better. But
we must first banish that literature which
glorifies gangsters and criminals and which,
I repeat, teaches evil ways. For a long time,
I have worked closely with family social
services and on behalf of our youth who in
the near future will take our place and to
whom we should give a proper education. I
am in a position to assess the terrible harm
which is done by such unwholesome literature. What is the use of spending billions of
dollars to assure our defence against external
enemies if, in the very heart of our nation,
we harbour an even more dangerous enemy
who is undermining its very life?
My colleagues no doubt know that last
week a child was kidnapped in Montreal and
that it was here, in Ottawa, that he was

SENATE

found. But do they know that in the room
of the person who is suspected of having
kidnapped that child, was found one of those
newspapers which teach how to go about kidnapping for ransom?
Apart from those filthy publications, we
must face another danger against which we
cannot even fight and which is an intruder
in our own homes. I refer to those objectionable shows brought in by television. Several
times a day we see on the screen, even in
programs especially intended for children,
some stage performances showing murders,
gangsters, shooting episodes and so on. Is
this a good example for children? A child of
seven, eight or ten does not worry about the
past or the future. He is wholly influenced
by what he sees.
And what about the wrestling and boxing
matches shown on television? Whether they
are faked or not, they glorify the pleasure
derived from the ability to cripple one's opponent. I read in a Luxembourg newspaper,
dated March 19 last, that the Belgian Senate
had unanimously passed a bill to forbid the
showing of wrestling and boxing matches on
television.
We should also prohibit the broadcasting of
such programs on our television network.
Several educators protest, and rightly so,
against such shows where human stupidity
prevails. I do not say that such televised
programs are immoral. However from the
newspaper Le Droit of April 26, 1958, I quote
the following: "By showing human beings
who act like animals, do we not encourage
men to behave like them?"
Coming back to literature, I ask the Minister of Justice if it would not be possible to
insert in the clause concerning obscene literaturc, a paragraph forbidding the publication
of those morbid magazines and literature
where may be found, condensed in eight, ten
or twelve pages, detailed reports of all the
murders, thefts, etc., committed during the
preceding week, showing that a thief was
arrested because of some miscalculation on
his part and that therefore, to succeed, such
errors must be avoided. From a report submitted to me I quote: "Such crime reports
contain really outrageous details. The photographs are unbelievably brutal and realistic,
and cannot be of any value to the reader
except to satisfy a morbid instinct or teach
him the ways of the criminal". In concluding,
may I make a very special appeal to parents,
as they are responsible for their children's
education. They have a strict duty to fulfil
toward their children who did not choose to
be born. Children were born through the will
of their parents and the latter have no right
to make bandits of them. May parents realize
their obligations, may they care for their
children, and I mean really care for them;

may they love them and love them well so
that they may become good citizens and be
in a better position than us-if it is possible
and I think it is-to make our nation stronger,
braver and better.

Hon. L. M.

Gouin: Honourable senators,

like our senator from Kennebec (Hon. Mr.
Vaillancourt) I am glad to begin by paying
my compliments to several of our colleagues.
First of all I wish to congratulate our very
distinguished Speaker on his reappointment
to his exalted position. He exercises his
function with great dignity and with a
praiseworthy impartiality. I believe that
we are all very proud of the senator who
presides over our deliberations.
I wish to congratulate also our senator
from Rosetown (Hon. Mr. Aseltine) on his
appointment as Leader of the Government
in the Senate. I assure him of my sincere
friendship and respect.
I extend my congratulations to the Deputy
Leader of the Government (Hon. Mr. Brunt).
His contribution to our work is already very
important.
To my leader, the Leader of the Opposition, (Hon. Mr. Macdonald), I express my
loyalty and my devotion. I add that in my
opinion he fulfils excellently his difficult
duty.
To the mover and the seconder of the
Address I am delighted to say that their
speeches fully deserve the very great praises
which have been extended to them.
To our new colleagues I add that I am
highly pleased that they have been favoured
by appointment to this chamber. I trust
that they will be happy to be associated with
us here and to serve our beloved country in
this house.
I wish especially to pay my respects to
the former Leader of the Government in
the Senate, our senior senator from Winnipeg, (Hon. Mr. Haig), and to express my
regret that he was unable to continue to act
as leader of his party in this house. He has
always shown a high sense for the prestige
of the Senate and he has done much to preserve and to enhance the dignity of this
chamber. The remarks which I am going to
make on the duties and functions of our
Senate are to some extent inspired by statements I have heard in the past from our
senior senator from Winnipeg. The main
source of my inspiration, however, is the
speech which was delivered in this debate
on May 22 by the honourable Leader of the
Opposition (Hon. Mr. Macdonald).
Honourable senators, in the Speech from
the Throne there is a vague reference to the
improvement of our parliamentary processes.
A rumour was circulated before the opening

JULY 2. 1958
of this session that the Government was to
submit a plan to reform this house. If such
news had any foundation I, of course, do not
know; but, honourable senators, if a day
ever comes when it is necessary to discuss
any change in our procedure, or even in our
structure, I believe that such discussion and
such reform should originate in this chamber.
On this point I beg leave to quote the last
paragraph of an article written by Mr. Clement Brown and published in Le Devoir
May 26, 1958. I translate it as faithfully as
I can:
The true reform of the Senate must be made
from the inside. The senators themselves must
accomplish what public opinion and the country
expect from them. The delicate situation In which
they are placed under the present circumstances
offers an additional reason to require them to give
back to the Senate all its prestige by rising above
parties and becoming again an asset for the nation
at large.

That a second chamber must yield to the
clearly expressed will of the people is shown
by the constitutional history of Great Britain
for more than a century and a quarter. The
Lords strongly disliked the Reform Act of
1832, but under the threat of the creation of
new peers that measure of popular emancipation was adopted. That the Upper House
must yield to the people if the people are
determined, was also demonstrated in the
case of the repeal, during Peel's administration, of the British Corn Laws. On this
occasion the Duke of Wellington succeeded
in guiding the Lords to their true position.
He wrote to Lord Derby a letter which concluded as follows:
My opinion Is that you should advise the house
to vote that which would tend most to public
order, and would be most beneficial to the immediate interests of the country.

I found that extract in Walter Bagehot's
The English Constitution. Immediately after
It is generally admitted that the Senate is referring to the opinion thus expressed by

Thus, the functions assigned to the Upper

Commons.

SENATE
To continue my parallel, I believe, first
of all, that the need or the use of a second
chamber is very generally accepted. At all
events, Confederation would have been simply
impossible if our Constitution had not provided for this Senate with an equal number
of 24 members for each of the three original
sections, namely, Lower Canada, Upper
Canada, and the Maritimes. In spite of unpleasant criticisms launched against us from
time to time, it remains true that Quebec
especially considers the Senate as a cornerstone of our federal system and would condemn as a gross breach of trust any
tampering with this house, even though we
have not yet reached perfection.
Honourable members, the Senate has
always been supposed to secure a certain
equality of representation between the various
regions of our federal union. However, the
Fathers of Confederation did not adopt the
principle of absolute equality by giving to
each province the same number of seats in
the Senate. On this point they did not copy
the American constitution. Neither did they
grant us the special powers enjoyed by the
United States Senate in matters of treaty
ratifications and constitutional amendments.
But it was apparently assumed that we would
be the guardians of provincial rights, that in
a certain sense we would each of us be a
representative of our particular province.
That mission of the Senate is only vaguely
defined, and I would say even more vaguely
applied. Since the day I entered this house,
in 1940, I have heard excellent speeches from
several of my colleagues, defending the rights
and interests of their respective provinces,
yet I know of no instance during this period
when a Government measure was defeated
or amended here because it would have encroached on provincial jurisdiction.
To sum up, since 1867 the main utility of
the Senate has not been to act as a champion
of local autonomy. Let us see precisely, therefore, how we have in fact filled our position.
First of all, the Senate quite rightly has never
striven for domination. I add with pride that
it has never been corrupt. Its debates have
been distinguished, and I think that it has
done and is doing excellent work in its standing committees. When time has permitted it
we have undertaken very successfully the
non-partisan revision of measures sent to us
from the other place.
It should be recognized also that this house
is rich in eminent specialists in agriculture,
finance, fisheries, mining, various industries,
trade and commerce, education, social science,
medicine, law in all its branches, and also international affairs. This list, honourable
senators, does not pretend to be exhaustive.

Except at the end of sessions we have
generally much fuller opportunities, much
more time, for expressing our views than
have the members of the other house.
The remarks I have made are inspired by
Lord Balfour's 1927 Introduction to Bagehot's
English Constitution. Relying on Bagehot
once more, I submit that though it be incredibly difficult to get a revising assembly,
to find a group of respected revisers, our
Senate is independent and efficient. We are
in some respects more independent than the
Commons. Our judgment is emphatically our
own judgment. We have no constituency to
fear or wheedle. We have the best means of
forming a disinterested and cool judgment.
We have also generally the leisure to form
such an impartial and sober judgment. Besides independence to revise judicially, and
the position to revise effectually, save in the
last hours of the session or in exceptional
cases, we have leisure to revise intellectually.
By this last adverb, Bagehot means, I believe,
to revise efficiently, in an intelligent and
enlightened manner.
In my opinion this house forms a
cross-section of our Canadian community.
The part which we have to play is different
from that of the House of Commons. Because
we are appointed by the Crown with a life
tenure, we can give to the bills before us
serious consideration without any undue
spirit of partisanship. We do our job as weli
as we can, and I am convinced that our most
useful contribution is our work in our various
committees, though it is not spectacular and
as a rule enjoys no publicity whatever.
If the press were paying more attention
to our committees and to the debates in this
house, it would render a real service to the
public and it would do better justice to us.
Our people at large would become better
acquainted with our institution and they
would realize our usefulness. We are an
essential part of Parliament, equal in rank
with the House of Commons, "a co-ordinate
estate of the realm", according to constitutional theory. Why are we so often criticized
as being practically useless? Why does a
party even advocate our abolition? Such
criticism takes place, in my opinion, because
our activities are not publicized enough and
thus they are simply ignored.
By way of conclusion, I submit that we
are in a position to discuss here not only
legislative measures, but also great questions
of important interest: for instance, international affairs, commonwealth relations-not
only in their political aspect but also from

JULY 2, 1958
an economic, social and cultural point of
view. I need not remind honourable senators
of the work of our committees on human
rights and on narcotics, of our non-official
committee on world federalism, of the very
interesting contacts which we thus established with some of our American friends.
In the past I tried without success to obtain
joint sittings of our Senate Committee on
External Relations and of the corresponding
committee of the House of Commons. That
committee in the other place sits to discuss
estimates of the Department of External
Affairs. The members of the House of Commons are jealous of their prerogatives in
financial matters. I realize the difficulty of
inviting us to take part in a discussion concerning the vote and the use of public funds,
but I still believe that such joint sittings
could be arranged to hear reports from the
Secretary of State for External Affairs and
the Under-Secretary, also from our representatives to the United Nations or to some
conferences abroad. Otherwise, experience
shows that it is often impossible, in particular, to secure at a convenient time the
appearance before our own committee of
the minister in charge of External Affairs,
who is our ambassador-at-large and obliged
to spend a great part of the session away
from Ottawa.
I remain convinced that we should devote
more time here to international affairs. I
welcome the suggestion recently made to
create a joint parliamentary committee of
representatives of the United States Congress
and of the Canadian Parliament. This is an
excellent idea, because we have everything
to gain by knowing each other better. Thus
misunderstandings may be avoided and occasional conflicts of interests may be settled
reasonably and amicably. It would be a great
privilege for us to be given this occasion to
promote better relations with our powerful
neighbours.
In my last remarks, I wish to appeal to the
Leader of the Government
(Hon. Mr.
Aseltine) so that this house, as much as
possible, may be able to give fuller consideration to all public bills which are sent
from the other house. Every year we have
deplored the fact that in the dying days of
the session measures arrive thick and fastI would say "by carloads"! I do not blame
the Government, for this practice has existed
for 91 years and has become a tradition. It
was denounced with indignation by the Right
Honourable Arthur Meighen, as shown by the
Senate Debates of March 8, 1934, page 140.
After him, it is my duty to repeat that "this
chamber is prepared for work, ready to serve
the people of this country." In Mr. Meighen's
words:

It is little less than a travesty . . . that a plethora
of legislation should be thrown at us in the latter
part of each session, when we have no opportunity
to do what we ought to do in the way of reviewing it, and all that the other house expects of us
is that we shall pass it without thought, without
amendment, and without delay.

Nothing, honourable senators, would do
more to restore prestige to the Senate than
the ending of this irritating procedure which
forces us to rush the adoption of tardy bills.
Let us remember that the essential duty
of this chamber, as described by Sir John A.
Macdonald in the Confederation Debates,
1865, at page 36:
-is to exercise, when thought proper, the right
of opposing or amending or postponing the legislation of the lower house.

Sir John added that our institution:
-would be of no value whatever were it a mere
chamber for registering the decrees of the lower
house.

Yes, honourable senators, our mission is
to be an independent house, to have a free
action of our own. The Senate-I quote
again from Macdonald:
-is
only valuable as being a regulating body,
calmly considering the legislation initiated by the
popular branch and preventing any hasty or illconsidered legislation which may corne from that
body.

Honourable senators, I admire the wisdom
of those remarks, and they are as true today
as they were in 1865. Our duty of revision
is, of course, subject to the limit which I
have already indicated: The Senate "will
never set itself in opposition against the
deliberate and understood wishes of the
people".
Whenever the Government has received
from the Canadian people a clear mandate for
a particular proposal, the Senate is bound,
in my opinion, to acquiesce in the popular
decision. Even if we doubt the wisdom of a
given measure, after the electors have expressed their will without ambiguity we have
but one course open to us. We must then
comply with the fundamental principle of
democracy which requires acceptance of the
decision of the majority. In other words, the
Senate must give good example by acting as
a really democratic institution and, as I
stated at the beginning of my address, by
voting "that which would tend most to
public order and would be most beneficial to
the immediate interests of the country".
The Address was adopted.

The powers given to the corporation are
similar to those given to any corporation of
the same kind. In Quebec a corporation is
permitted to hypothecate its property, both
present and future, on condition that the
act of incorporation permits hypothecation
of future properties. As respects this corporation, that would be the effect of the
amendment submitted by a member of the
committee, approved by the committee, and
accepted with a great deal of pleasure by
the corporation. That is the only reason for
the amendment; to give to the episcopal

NARCOTIC DRUG TRAFFIC

PROPOSED IMPLEMENTATION OF SPECIAL
COMMITTEE'S RECOMMENDATIONS
-DEBATE ADJOURNED
Hon. Thomas Reid rose in accordance with
the following notice:
That he will call the attention of the Senate

to prevalence of narcotic addiction in Canada and
the desirability of introducing legisiation to implement the recommendations of the Special Committee of the Senate on the Traffic in Narcotic Drugs
in Canada, which reported to this house on 23rd
June, 1955.

He said: Honourable senators, in rising to
speak on the inquiry standing in my name,
may I say at the outset that it is not my intention to deal at any great length with the
report itself which was tabled in the Senate
of June 23, 1955. I have one or two particular
reasons for introducing this motion, which I
will reveal before I am through with my
speech. I want to say first, that in spite of
some criticism, particularly by certain individuals in the city of Vancouver, it is my
opinion that the Senate can very well be
proud of that report which was made in 1955.
As a matter of fact, I challenge all who
have criticized the report to tell us on what
point we could add any further witnesses,
or where the committee could have gone to
obtain any further evidence during the time
of our inquiry. There were 23 members on
the committee. Forty-two witnesses appeared,
including the Minister and officials of the
Department of National Health and Welfare,
14 qualified doctors-many of these having
experience in drugs and with drug addicts;

there were representations from France, a
very prominent official representative from
Britain, and two representatives from the
United States. Representations were made by
the Salvation Army as well as by certain
church ministers, and wardens and other
officials of penitentiaries and jails came
before us, as did members of the John Howard
Society, and the Chief Constables of Montreal,
Toronto, Vancouver and Edmonton. There
were also many briefs presented, and a number of private citizens appeared before the
committee. The Department of Justice was
represented, and heads of the R.C.M.P.
appeared, as well as some police magistrates.
Apart frorn that, the committee visited the
Oakalla prison farm and interviewed 150
drug addicts, spending the whole forenoon in
hearing their stories in private. In addition
we held private sessions with drug addicts.
With that beginning, may I say that the
situation as it existed in 1955 and as it exists
today has not materially changed, but I am
pleased to say that it has not worsened. In
1954 there was a total of 3,212 drug addicts
in Canada; in 1955, 3,425; in 1956, 3,241; and
in 1957, 3,315.
One of the strange things to me, in looking
over the number of drug addicts in the
various provinces, is how few there are in the
Maritime provinces. Indeed, it is intriguing
when one looks over the figures, for there
were only six criminal addicts in the province of Nova Scotia last year, and none in
New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island or
Newfoundland. I thought it would be interesting to honourable senators to have the latest
figures, and to point out to those who come
from the Maritimes that they can well
be proud of their provinces in not having
many drug addicts. In the Maritimes and
Newfoundland there was a total of 66, most
of whom were medical and professional
addicts.
Hon. Mr. McDonald: They may have come
from British Columbia.
Hon. Mr. Reid: I wish I had the tirne and
opportunity to debate that. Generally speaking most of the addicts in British Columbia
come from eastern parts of Canada to settle
down, like many others, in our beautiful
province.
Honourable senators, there has been a
great deal of misunderstanding in the minds
of certain citizens in the city of Vancouver,
owing to a report put out by the Chest clinic,
and it is in an endeavour to correct the misrepresentations on that matter that I am
prompted to speak this afternoon. In their
report of 1954 was a statement drawing
attention to what has taken place in Great
Britain. Great Britain has a population of

JULY 3, 1958
45 million, and its records showed a total
of only 305 drug addicts, whereas Canada,
with a population of 15 or 16 million, had
over 3,000 addicts. It is this startling disparity which has interested many persons.
Among the witnesses who appeared before
our committee we were fortunate in having
Mr. Walker, representing Great Britain, who
at the time happened to be in New York
attending the Narcotic Commission of the
United Nations. We particularly asked Mr.
Walker about the system in Great Britain.
Now, the thought in the minds of certain
people in Vancouver and elsewhere in British
Columbia is that Great Britain is giving
out drugs in quantity, so to speak, to drug
addicts, and that if we had a system of
that kind we would cure the addicts here. As
is well known to most of us who have had
anything to do with the problem of drug
addiction, drugs costs anywhere from $2 to
$5 a shot. Some addicts use up to eight
shots per day, and the money has to be found
somewhere. It was natural, therefore, for
people around Vancouver to become disturbed about the great number of addicts
in that city, and it was owing to the resulting
agitation that our committee came into being.
For the benefit of those who still hold to
the belief that we should adopt or try out
the British system, I wish to place on record
the very words used by Mr. Walker, and
surely they will be accepted as the voice of
one knowing the conditions in Great Britain.
Mr. Walker stated:
The continued supply of drugs to a patient, either
direct or by prescription, solely for the gratification of addiction, is not regarded as a 'medical
need.'

To those who advocate giving drug addicts
all the drugs they want, I would say that
one might just as well advocate giving an
alcoholic all the whisky he can drink in
order to cure him. But I am quoting Mr.
Walker, the British authority. He went on
to say:
-the
continued supply of drugs to a patient
either direct or by prescription, solely for the
gratification of the addiction, is not regarded as
a "medical" need.

He said further:
The "criminal" addict, ie., the addict who is a
confirmed criminal quite apart from his drug addiction, is virtually unknown in the United Kingdom.

Here may I point out to those senators who
were not members of the committee or who
have just recently come to the Senate, that the
great distinction between those who take
narcotic drugs in Great Britain and those
who take narcotic drugs in Canada is this,
that in Great Britain they have no such person
as a criminal addict, whereas in Canadaand ample proof of this was given by witnesses who appeared before us-70 per cent of
57075-4-17

those who take drugs are criminals and had
led a dissolute and criminal life before they
ever started taking drugs. So in this country
we have a dual problem when we are looking
for the cure of a drug addict. If one has not
done any work and lived by thieving for the
better part of his life, supposing he is taken
off the use of drugs, the question must be
asked: is he going to commence work and
carry out useful employment from that time
onward? We doubt it. However, I am just
bringing that to the attention of honourable
senators.
Here is a more definite statement by Mr.
Walker.
There are not and never have been in the United
Kingdom drug clinics in the sense in which this
phrase is sometimes misused in North America to
describe an institution where an addict may receive
supplies of a drug either gratis or at a nominal
charge.

Now, surely that statement should be accepted by all Canadians, coming as it did from
one of the highest authorities in Great Britain,
a man who is handling the drug situation over
there. Naturally we were very anxious to
have a definite statement from him in view
of the statement from the Chest clinic in
Vancouver that we should try the British
system here, which was immediately seized
upon by uninformed persons who thought the
British system was to give a person all the
drugs he required. It certainly does not.
I could mention the names of quite a
number of witnesses. One doctor, who also
had practised in London, England, corroborated Mr. Walker's statement that the British
system was not a free clinic system or one
that permitted the giving of drugs to addicts
as they wanted them. As I say, I could place
on the record half a dozen names of witnesses
but I shall not take up the time of the Senate
this afternoon to do so. It is perhaps sufficient
to say that of the 14 medical men who appeared before our committee and gave evidence-men who had experience with drug
addiction-only two, I think, favoured-and
that only to a limited degree-the trying out
of the clinic system, and they qualified their
suggestions by saying, if all other schemes
failed.
One of the particular reasons which
prompted me to introduce this resolution was
a statement which appeared in the press
a short time ago and somewhat perturbed
me. It shows that our press is sometimes a
little keen to read into remarks by cabinet
ministers, or even by the Prime Minister,
what it thinks will attract attention. The
statement purported to be made by the
Honourable Mr. Fulton, the Minister of
Justice, has created a great deal of concern
and controversy. I am not going to quote all

SENATE
the press clippings I have in my hand, but
they accuse him of recommending the trying
out of drug clinies. I can hardly believe he
made any such definite statement. I know
a short time ago he was careful-I would not
say he hedged-to make clear that was not
what ho meant. But when I read a heading
such as "May Give Drugs to Addicts", followed by a whole story about what Justice
Minister Fulton said, and an editorial entitled
'Learning About Drugs", which criticized the
Minister for proposing clinics, I thought it
vell to draw the matter to the attention of
the Senate and, I trust, to the attention of
the Minister, with the suggestion that he
should read over the evidence and the report
if the Senate committee. If he can find any
consensus of witnesses who favour the clinic
system, well, hc must be reading a different
report, because I cannot find any such recommendations other than those of the two
doctors I mention.
Has any country
Hon. Mr. Macdonald:
other than England adopted the system?
Hon. Mr. Reid: No. I am glad you mentioned that, because when the report that
the Minister of Justice was inclined to support drug clinies rcached the United Nations
Narcotic Commission, which at the time was
sitting in Geneva, my information is that
the commission was greatly disturbed because the United Nations has gone on record
as being absolutely opposed to drug clinics.
Now that means that Great Britain, United
States, France, Canada, Australia and other
United Nation countries are against the idea
of drug clinics. Despite the fact that the
United Nations has set its face against it, that
each signatory country is against drug
clinics, certain individuals around Vancouver
still advocate drug clinics, both in the press
and at meetings, and in a few instances
some of them have criticized very severely
the report of the Senate committee. That is
why I challenge thern to tell us where the
committee could have found one more witness
who could have testified regarding drug
addiction. We heard all the witnesses possible. We travelled about the country, and we
invited every interested person to come and
testify. I know of no one other than the
great number of doctors, high officials and
others who did appear before us, and who in
their evidence were mostly all against drug
clinies as such.
Honourable senators will appreciate that I
was somewhat perturbed when the Minister
of Justice came into the picture for at first
blush it looked as if he was favouring a
trial of drug clinics. Having had the honour
of being Chairman of the Special Committee

on the Traffic in Narcotic Drugs, I deemed it
my duty to say something about this question
today.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Were there any reputable doctors who suggested the inauguration
of clinics?
Hon. Mr. Reid: We had two doctors before
us who, while they did not fully support
clinies, went so far as to suggest that for
incurable addicts, if treatment centres failed,
clinics were preferable to imprisonment for
life, as some witnesses had advocated. These
doctors made reference to the British system
of free clinics, at which a drug addict is
given some, but not all, the drugs he needsand therefore it is a systern entirely different
from what they were advocating. To me that
is a preposterous proposal to be put forward
seriously by respectable persons.
Our report was criticized on the ground
that it was one-sided and it recommended
only severe penalties. That criticism is far
from the truth. We went into the question
very thoroughly and we advocated treatment
centres; but we were aware that under the
British North America Act such centres and
hospitalization generally come within the
jurisdiction of the provinces and not of the
federal Government. So, our report and
recommendations were twofold. We recommended what we felt should be done by the
provincial authorities. It will take only a
moment to read our recommendation in that
respect:
After a most careful and exhaustive examination
of the evidence and of all the factors involved in
treatment, the committce is strongly of the opinion
that the recognition of drug addiction as a treatment responsibility, with the provision of facilities
therefor by provincial authorities, is long overdue.
The committee in pointing out the responsibility
of provincial authorities for treatment, does not
minimize the difficulties that are presented nor the
fact that a great number of drug addicts offer little
These
or no promise for successful treatment.
difficulties would not in the opinion of the Committee justify the continued failure to provide
treatmîent procedures and facilities.

That part of our recommendation to the
provincial authorities was directed particularly to the province of British Columbia,
where most of the addicts are located, in and
around the city of Vancouver. Further, in
our report we made proposals as to severe
penalties and what should be undertaken by
the federal authorities.
I do not intend to place any blame on the
federal Government for not having taken
action, because it has only recently come
into great power, but I feel I should suggest
to the Government that it give the matter
some serious thought, if it has not already

JULY
done so, and that it should take up with the
provinces the question of establishing treatment centres.
Under the new hospital insurance legislation British Columbia is going to get between
$12 million and $15 million, which it has
already been spending under its present provincial hospitalization plan. That province now
collects a sales tax, out of which it pays for
the out-patient service and so forth proposed
by the new federal act.
With respect to the $15 million odd that
the province of British Columbia will receive
under the new act, I am suggesting to the
Premier of that province that he could very
well spend some of that money in setting
up trial centres for the treatment of drug
addicts. In fact, I go further: I think that
he should allocate larger contributions toward
the building of hospitals, because, as most
of us know, the burden of hospitalization
today falls largely on the man who owns a
house or other property taxed at the municipal
level. While the provincial Government does
make contributions toward hospital construction and costs I think some additional money
could be directed to the purpose I have just
mentioned. I am therefore placing that suggestion on the record.
As I said at the outset of my remarks, I
rose mainly to speak against the proposed
drug clinics and the support that has been
given to the idea among certain persons
in and around Vancouver; and further, to
draw to the attention of the Minister of
Justice the fallacy of endeavouring to put
such a system into effect. As one newsman
put it: if the Honourable Mr. Fulton puts
drug clinics into effect, the system will be
known for all time as "Fulton's Folly".
Hon. F. W. Gershaw: Honourable senators,
the honourable senator from New Westminster
(Hon. Mr. Reid) deserves our thanks for
bringing forward this subject at this time.
I quite agree with him that the so-called
clinics, which are merely sources of supply,
have not worked out very well. But I am
bound to say that the clinics that have been
established, and perhaps any that might be
established, are not for the purpose of giving
unlimited quantities of narcotics to addicts,
but rather for the administering of control
doses, in the hope of doing something by way
of treatment and at least keeping consumption
down to the minimum required by the addict.
Honourable senators, as I wish to discuss
this question further, I now move adjournment of the debate.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Gershaw, debate
adjourned.

WESTERN GRAIN SITUATION
INQUIRY

Hon. Norman McL. Paterson: Honourable
senators, may I ask the Leader of the Government, (Hon. Mr. Aseltine) if he would
at this time care to make a statement to
the house with respect to the matter which
the Prime Minister brought up in the other
place as to the seriousness of the grain situation in Saskatchewan and Manitoba? I was
somewhat startled to read today that so many
farmers are going to require assistance, and
I wondered if the Leader of the Government
in this house had any information about it.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Honourable senators, I
do not care to make a statement on this
question at the present time. I understand
the situation is being looked into very carefully by the Prime Minister, and that it is
most serious indeed. While I have some information from certain parts of Saskatchewan, I would like to get more complete facts
before I make any detailed reply to the
question asked. I will make a statement at
the earliest opportunity.
Hon. Mr. Paterson: Thank you.
CANADA-UNITED STATES RELATIONS
MOTION TO APPROVE SUGGESTED ESTABLISHMENT OF JOINT PARLIAMENTARY
COMMITTEES-DEBATE ADJOURNED

Hon. Wishart McL.
pursuant to notice:

Robertson

moved,

That the Senate of Canada welcomes the recent
suggestion of the Prime Minister of Canada for the
establishment of joint parliamentary committees
between Canada and the United States of America,
believes it can be of great benefit in improving
relations between the two countries, and offers
our whole-hearted co-operation.

He said: Honourable senators, I personally
welcome the recent statement by the Prime
Minister supporting the idea of joint legislative committees composed of legislators of
Canada and the United States. I have no
knowledge or information as to what particular form such joint committees might take,
but the details are not particularly important
and can be easily worked out. In case, however, the inspiration for the Prime Minister's
remarks came from suggestions of two United
States legislators who recently visited Canada, I think attention should be drawn to the
fact that several years ago the Senate of
Canada was directly and indirectly associated
with the first attempt made in this direction.
I would hope, therefore, that the Senate itself
would welcome the Prime Minister's suggestion and pledge its continued co-operation.
This is but another instance of "What the
Senate thinks today, others think tomorrow."

SENATE
1 am bound to say, though, that sometimes it
may be "the day after tomorrow".
Honourable senators, Canada has always
been conspicuously laggard in providing
facilities for her legislators to come in contact with legislators of other countries. The
one outstanding exception has been our participation as a member of the Commonwealth
Parliamentary Association. This association,
which has been of tremendous benefit to all
concerned, meets every two years. Canada's
delegation generally consists of seven members, six from the House of Commons and one
or two from the Senate. Last year the association met in the Far East, and our distinguished Government Leader (Hon. Mr.
Aseltine) was the Canadian delegate. Two
years prior to that the meeting was held in
Africa, and the honourable senator from
Medicine Hat (Hon. Mr. Gershaw) was our
delegate.
About every ten years it is the turn of
each member country to act as host. Four or
five years ago Canada was the host country
and the deliberations took place in this very
chamber. Except for taking part in the
activities of the Commonwealth Parliamentary
Association, Canadian legislators do not have
the same opportunities as do legislators from
the United States, the United Kingdom and
other European countries to meet with
parliamentarians from other countries. For example, Canada is not a member of the InterParliamentary Union, although she has frequently been invited to join it, and I know
that when I was Speaker of the Sonate this
country was invited to send observers to
meetings of the Union. I understand that at
the present time the Speakers of both Houses
of Parliament hold invitations to the meeting
of this organization which is to take place in
Rio de Janeiro this year.

delegation. They all expressed the value of
associating with legislators of the commonwealth.
The United Kingdom takes a leading part
in the activities of the Commonwealth
Parliamentary Association. In addition she
is directly connected with such organizations
as the Couneil of Europe, the Western
European Union, and the Inter-Parliamentary
Union. Distances are shorter in Europe, of
course, but over the years it has been my
experience that the legislators of those
countries have had far greater facilities than
Canadian legislators have had to meet on a
personal basis and acquire viewpoints of
legislators of other countries.
Some years ago a group of Canadian
parliamentarians, representing both houses
and all political parties, feeling that something should be done about this matter,
established an informal committee under the
joint chairmanship of the honourable senator
from De Salaberry (Hon. Mr. Gouin), who
at that tine was Chairman of the Senate

and Mr. Bradette, now the honourable senator

JULY 3, 1958
later, on the occasion of the first visit of
President Eisenhower to Canada, when it
became my privilege to thank him on behalf
of the Senate of Canada, I referred to what
I felt was the great value in an exchange of
visits by members of the executive of the
two countries, and I pointed out the conspicuous lack of an exchange of visits by
legislators. I recall that afterwards when
we met in the quarters of the Speaker of
the House of Commons the President immediately took it up, and said, "I heartily agree
with this, and what can I do about it?" I
replied, "It is a matter of giving it your
blessing, and then it comes down to the
details." He called his secretary over and
said, "Make a note of it, and make sure it is
donc." However, the President has tremendous responsibilities, and apparently there
are only 24 hours in the day in Washington,
as elsewhere, and it was never done.
Then the committee, reinforced by some
others, decided to approach the matter in
an indirect fashion. We undertook to initiate
a Canadian NATO Parliamentary Association,
thinking that would bring ourselves in and
broaden the base in connection with legislators of the other NATO countries, which
of course included the United States. We had
the idea that after that was once established
a sort of subcommittee would be set up to
bring Canadian and American legislators
closely together. In 1955, or prior to that, the
Canadian NATO Parliamentary Association
extended invitations to the Speakers of the
respective Parliaments and to every one of
the 15 NATO countries. That succeeded
beyond the expectations of the most optimistic.
We expected perhaps 100 delegates might
arrive in Paris, but there were 200, representing 15 different countries. At that time,
although in our enthusiasm we had taken the
lead in interesting the other countries and
had found a very agreeable degree of acceptance to the idea, it was recognized that there
were sone very practical problems to be
faced as to how we were to get to Paris,
because distances were great and there were
no funds in the treasury for the purpose.
However, we prevailed upon the Government
to arrange a trip to take the legislators to see
our defence forces in Europe, and were able
to synchronize that trip with the time of
the meeting with the legislators in Paris.
That arrangement having been made, 20
legislators from Canada, representing all
parties and including among them the present
Prime Minister, went to Paris. This was not
done without some criticism, both outside of
Parliament and within. At this moment I
wish to pay a tribute to those who initiated
this program. I had the pleasure and honour
to be head of the delegation, and when I was

chosen as first president of the association
I had the great honour and privilege of
nominating Mr. Diefenbaker to speak for
Canada on that occasion. Perhaps unconsciously it was a case of coming events casting
their shadows before them.
I want to say another word in appreciation of that committee which originally
invited the American legislators here, and of
those who visited Paris at that time. In the
first place, all the expenses in connection
with the invitation, the entertainment of the
guests here at the hotel, and everything else,
were defrayed out of the pockets of the
members of the committee, by "passing the
hat." The Government provided an aeroplane te take the legislators to Paris, but
every one of the legislators, including the
present Prime Minister, paid his own living
expenses in Paris-and they were the only
representatives of any of the 15 countries
who did so. I say that to the everlasting
credit of those who pioneered the idea of the
legislators meeting together, which I think
is a sound principle.
Honourable senators, coming now to the
specific proposal of the Prime Minister, I
have no hesitation in supporting it. I say
that with some experience of legislators
meeting together. I have never been present
at a Commonwealth Parliamentary Association, but I had considerable experience in
inducing Americans to be interested in the
NATO Parliamentary Association, and in the
events leading up to the formation of the
first meeting which took place in Paris. Of
course, I realize and appreciate that under
our system of government the primary
responsibility for policy rests upon the executive, and the administrative branch of government bas the responsibility of putting government policies into effect. But there is a
curious defect in the parliamentary set-up
when the legislators are left without any
opportunity to hear particular views or ideas
in regard to external relations, except
through whatever medium the Government
wishes to use. I was a cabinet minister for
eight years, and I say without hesitation that
there is no aureole or halo around the head of
any cabinet minister; he is just a human
being, like the rest of us, having duties to
perform.
Ordinarily, a representative of the Government goes to a country and is in contact
with the Government of that country alone.
The great advantage of legislators of all
parties meeting with legislators of different
political views is that they have an opportunity of hearing conflicting viewpoints.
I
think that is of inestimable advantage, and
in my contacts with legislators of the United
States, the United Kingdom and continental

SENATE
countries I found they had a far wider appreciation of the public thought and viewpoint and the currents of public opinion than
would have been possible otherwise. I say
unhesitatingly that the principle of this is
good, and I think that nowhere could it be of
greater aivantage than between Canada and
the United States. I say so particularly because of the form of government which the
United States has. As honourable senators
know, a government of this country must
have a majority in the House of Commons or
it is no longer the government. Quite the
contrary situation exists in the United States.
I believe that there has been a series of
governments in the United States very well
disposed towards Canada and ber interests,
but the body which determines whether its
policies are to be put into effect is the Congress.
For some curious reason, over the years
there has been a tremendous gulf between

executive of each Government, its administrators, business interests, tourists and citizens
generally travel in large numbers between
Canada and the United States, and yet a
personal relationship between the legislators
of the two countries has been conspicuous by
it absence. I never was able to give any
adequate explanation of why this is so. Of
course in recent years members of the American Congress have travelled in large numbers to various parts of the world where they
viewed or inspected the results of the various
large expenditures which the United States
has made there. One of the reasons for not
including Canada in their travels was that,
as honourable senators know, this was the
only country in the world that was not receiving any financial assistance from the
United States. The defence expenditures in
the far north were perhaps something to the
contrary, but they are not in the same
category.
Because there is this conspicuous gulf of
which I speak between the legislators of the
two countries I am glad to have the present
Prime Minister throw the weight of his great
personal influence and his high position behind the idea of a better relationship. It is
difficult to get such a relationship established
on a permanent and continuing basis without
the initial support and backing of the Government, although it is not a matter for the
Government particularly. It is something not
that it can direct, but only that it can make
possible and feasible.
The first reaction to the proposal for an
improved relationship is that great advantage
will accrue from having United States
legislators know more about Canada, but I
suggest to honourable senators that it is not

entirely one-sided. I think we in Canada can
learn a lot more than any of us realize
through being in personal contact with them.
On the few occasions when I have been in
Washington I have been treated with the
greatest courtesy and invariably invited to
take a seat on the floor of the Senate, as
have other Canadian senators. In my personal
contacts with our American confrères I
appreciated more and more what a tremendous country they have, what a great
people they are, what outstanding leadership
they have given the world, what heavy
responsibilities they bear, and what numerous
and difficult problerns they face; and I never
came back from a visit with their legislators
without a strong feeling of confidence as to
how fortunate we are to be living next door
ta such a country and such a people.
Occasionally I have heard of some honourable colleagues referring critically to the
NORAD agreement and the possible part it
may play in the defence of this country, but
I think that before going to sleep at night
every Canadian should realize and appreciate
the tremendous advantage it is to have such
a great power se close to our borders ready
to come to our assistance if and when the
ecaos1on ever arises.
Commercially, and in every way one can
possibly think of, we cannot know too much
about our neighbours. In the past some very
unftrtunate anti-American campaigns have
been carried on, but a lot of what is said on
such occasions does not mean very much,
largely because when we criticize the Americans we are really criticizing ourselves, for
they are as much like us as they can possibly
be. If you were to go to Washington and
argue with them about the imbalance of trade
between Canada and the United States they
would say, "Yes, but that is not the only
place where an imbalance exists; you are
selling a lot more to the United Kingdom
and the Western European continent than
you buy from them." Trade flows in different
directions in that respect. I cannot think of
any Canadian legislator going to Washington
on a regularly arranged trip, meeting the
legislators there and getting their viewpoint,
without benefiting a great deal; and on the
other hand, I am prepared to say that I
think it would be of tremendous advantage
to the American legislators themselves.
I remember very well that after a two-day
discussion in a committee here at which
various questions were discussed, Senator
Gillette and Congressman Johnson came to my
office in the corner of the building where
the present Leader of the Government (Hon.
Mr. Aseltine) has his office now. I can see
them sitting there: they both had been in
Congrcess for upwards of 20 years, and each

JULY
was kindly disposed toward Canada. But they
told me they had learned more about Canada
in the two days they were in that committee
room than in the whole period of their congressional experience, and they hoped it would
become a practice for United States legislators
to visit this country.
I remember one other instance. After the
American legislators returned to Washington
there was some little difficulty in getting a
return invitation. They had suggested one
or two dates which, for some reason or other,
did not seem to be acceptable; and at one
time the committee asked me if at any time
I was in the United States I would approach
someone in authority and try to get something
started along that line. It was a little difficult
for me to go to any person other than one
who might be regarded as my opposite number in the United States. At that time I was
the Government Leader in the Senate and
the closest to my opposite number under their
system of government was Senator Taft, the
majority leader in the United States Senate
during the first Eisenhower administration.
As honourable senators well know, he was
a very influential man.
I wrote to Senator Taft and asked for an
appointment with him and he replied that
he would be very glad to see me. Some time
after that, during an adjournment of our
Senate, I went to Washington to keep my
appointment with him-I think it was at
half-past four of an afternoon. I had never
met the gentleman before and I was a little
terrified; I thought he was a very austere
type of man. I went to his office, and he
simply said, "What can I do for you?" I proceeded to tell him what the committee had
in mind, what its hopes and aspirations were,
and what we would like to see done. The
explanation and discussion took about ten
minutes, during which time he listened with
his eyes fastened on me, without making a
single comment or facial expression to indicate whether he was approving or disapproving. Suddenly he turned around slightly
in his chair and said, "You fellows don't know
how right you are." He added, "Let me give
you my own personal experience: my father
took me to Murray Bay when I was three
years old and I have been going there every
summer since for sixty years". As honourable
senators know, the late President Taft had a
summer place at Murray Bay and he went
there over a period of many years. The
senator added, "I think once or twice I have
met some Canadian legislators, but I am
ashamed to say that I have never been in
Ottawa in my life." He said further, "You
have been working with Senator Saltonstall
and these others; go out and arrange the
details, and I am behind you 100 per cent."

Unfortunately, Senator Taft died a year or
two afterwards, but his foresight laid the
foundation for the proposals which the Prime
Minister is supporting and there is his great
personal and social influence behind it.
If this house feels as I hope it does it will
welcome the suggestion of the Prime Minister,
express the opinion that we believe the establishment of joint parliamentary committees
would improve relations between our two
countries, and pledge wholehearted support
of it.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Honourable senators, if
no other honourable senators wish to speak
at this time, I beg leave to adjourn the
debate.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Aseltine, debate
adjourned.
PRIVATE BILL
CANADIAN WOMEN'S PRESS CLUB-SECOND
READING

Hon. Norman P. Lambert moved the second
reading of Bill S-8, to incorporate Canadian
Women's Press Club.
He said: Honourable senators, having come
to the bottom of the Order Paper on the last
sitting day of the week, it is hardly a
propitious time to attempt to address this
honourable body. But I assure my honourable
friends that what I have to say will be
reduced to as few words as I can possibly
employ appropriately to sponsor second reading of this bill.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: We want to hear
you.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: I should like to emphasize that this bill, if enacted, will represent
a rather unique and historic piece of legislation. So far as I know, or have been able
to ascertain, no other group of working writers
in the Canadian newspaper and journalistic
field has sought to incorporate itself into a
national organization or association.
Many local press clubs exist as voluntary
associations or organizations in the larger
cities in Canada, where both men and women
writers are established on the staffs of newspapers and journals having wide circulation
in the country. For example, the Toronto
Press Club, of which I was a member some
50 years ago, has been in existence for a very
long time. Similar clubs in Montreal, in
Maritime centres, Winnipeg, Vancouver and
in intervening cities of the Middle West, have
also been active for many years.
Apart from the Parliamentary Press Gallery,
which is an institution by itself, there is also
the Ottawa Press Club, embracing members
of the craft from other parts of the country
as well as those connected with publications
in this city. It has remained, however, for
the women members of the press in Canada

SENATE
to identify themselves for over half a century
as a national organization known as the
Canadian Women's Press Club. That voluntary, unincorporated association has been in
existence for 54 years, and it is now felt
that the time has come to secure incorporation,
which is proposed in this bill.
No extraordinary powers are sought. The
club does not engage in any commercial
enterprise, and no powers are sought in that
direction. Under section 6 of the bill new
powers are provided for the purpose of
acquiring and holding property which might
be devoted to the executive functions of the
association, but no active commercial enterprise is involved.
I should point out here the Canadian
Press Association, with its Daily and Weekly
sections, representing the ownership of the
principal publications throughout the country,
has long had its corporate existence: and one
assumes that the petitioners cited in this bill
will have had no difficulty with their influential and powerful bosses in connection with
the proposed use of the word "association"
in place of the amended word "club".
At any rate I can assure honourable
senators that it is a pleasure and a privilege
for me to sponsor this bill, but I do so with
some diffidence, under the scrutiny of my
good friend and colleague the senator from
Victoria (Hon. Mrs. Hodges), who has been
a distinguished journalist and member of
the Canadian Women's Press Club for many
years. She is better qualified than I am to
do full justice to this bill, and unfortunately
she is unavoidably absent today.
My only possible apology for presenting
this bill may rest in the fact that the
pioneer founder of the Canadian Women's
Press Club some 54 years ago was a man.
That distinguished gentleman was the late
George Ham, assistant to the late Lord
Shaughnessy of the Canadian Pacific Railway Company, and known throughout Canada
and the United States as one of the greatest
performers in the art of public relations that
this country has produced. The name of
George Ham will be remembered now by
only a comparative few survivors of his
generation, and I am glad of the opportunity
to revive his memory. He himself was a
veteran newspaperman; and all his life, even
during the years of his association with Lord
Shaughnessy and the C.P.R., he continued
to be one of the craft. He had a remarkable
background in history. He was born in
Trenton, Ontario-or Canada West, as that
section was then known-in 1846. His father
was a doctor who turned lawyer and moved
to Kingston to join a firm bearing the name
of John A. Macdonald. George Ham received
his early education at the grammar school

in Whitby, and as early as 1865 went to
work on the paper there known as the
Whitby Chronicle. He later went to Winnipeg
and in 1875 he joined the staff of the Winnipeg Free Press, then under the editorship
of Mr. Luxton, whose name I am sure is
well known to the honourable senior senator
from Winnipeg (Hon. Mr. Haig). In 1879
Mr. Ham left the Free Press staff and founded
the Winnipeg Tribune. During the Riel Rebellion of 1885 he sent a series of famous dispatches to the Toronto Mail which brought
him much favourable attention, and I think
possibly as a result of that he accepted an
appointment by the C.P.R. in 1891 as advertising manager for that company. Later
he became assistant to the president, Lord
Shaughnessy, in charge of public relations
for the C.P.R.
I have taken time to mention something
of Mr. Ham for the particular reason that
it was on his private car, en route home in
the summer of 1904 from writing assignments
at the World's Fair in St. Louis, Missouri,
that a group of pioneer Canadian women
journalists adopted his suggestion to form
the Canadian Women's Press Club. The first
president was a lady named Kathleen Blake
Coleman, who was known to readers of the
Mail and Empire in Toronto for many years
under the pen name "Kit". George Ham was
elected an honourary member of that club
and was the only man ever admitted to
membership. When he passed away, in 1926,
the club erected a bronze tablet in the Windsor Station in Montreal as a tribute to his
friendship and counsel during 22 years.
The club's second general meeting took
place in Winnipeg in June 1906, when its
formal organization was established. Mrs.
Coleman, the first president, was succeeded
by a Winnipeg woman of some note as a
writer, Kate Simpson Hayes, and in the following years that office was held by these
rather distinguished women whose names
became well-known throughout the country:
Robertine Barry, Ethel Lindsay Osborne,
Marjory MacMurchy-later Lady WillisonJudge Emily Murphy, known to Canadian
readers as "Janey Canuck", Lucy Swanton
Doyle, Kenneth Haig, sister of our respected
senior colleague from Winnipeg, Mae Stuart
Clendenan, Margaret Ellis Lawrence, Elizabeth Bailey Price, Isabel C. Armstrong,
Rosa L. Shaw, Dora Dibney, Wilma Tait,
Winnifred Stokes, Rita Willard Meyers, Marjorie S. Oliver, Dorothy L. Taylor, daughter
of the late Senator J. D. Taylor of British
Columbia and now Madeleine Levason, whose
name appears in this bill.
Many other names of distinction could be
associated with this list of presidents as outstanding members of their profession whose

JULY 3, 1958
services have been recognized throughout all
Canada. I have referred to our colleague
Senator Nancy Hodges. With her name I
would also associate that of the late E. Cora
Hind of the Winnipeg Free Press. Miss Emily
Boswell of the Winnipeg Tribune, Miss MacLennan and Mrs. W. M. Davidson of Calgary,
Maude McKinney of Edmonton, Madge Merton, later the wife of the late J. E. Atkinson,
owner and publisher of the Toronto Daily
Star, Miss Madge MacBeth, now living in
Ottawa, Miss Betty Thornley, Miss Eleanor
Sanderson, Mrs. Mona Cleaver Purser, Mrs.
Forsythe Grant and Miss Jean Graham of
Toronto are additional names which may be
worthily associated with the membership of
this organization, and one apologizes for
overlooking others which might appropriately
be recorded here.
Since the first group of 14 members was
organized in 1904 the club has grown to a
membership of over 600, with 15 branches
from coast to coast. Its national executive
committee consists of 15 officers, including
eight regional directors.
Those seeking
membership must be sponsored by two members in good standing, and each active member must annually submit proof of her continuing eligibility.
The club revises its
constitution to keep pace with changing
times. It now admits women press photographers, and writers in such fields as radio,
TV, screen, information, publicity and public
relations.
The club was received in membership in
the Commonwealth Press Union in 1930, and
is informally but actively allied with women's
press clubs in the United Kingdom and the
United States. Since 1913 it has maintained
a Beneficiary Fund to assist members in
temporarily straitened circumstances.
In
1935 it set up its now nationally recognized
annual Members' Memorial Awards. These,
for which any woman writer resident in
Canada may compete, consist of metals and
cash awards. Several branches also offer
annual scholarships or cash awards to women
showing special aptitude in the writing
profession at local universities.
The clubs objects, as set forth in section
2 of the bill, continue to be: to encourage
women in these professions; to promote and
protect its members' interests and improve
their status; to promote knowledge and love
of their country and a higher standard of
excellence in their profession, and to foster
good will between members and women
similarly engaged in other lands.
I am sure, honourable senators that enough
has been said, even in this rather sketchy
manner, to give the house some idea of the
scope of the Canadian Women's Press Club.
57075-4-18

In conclusion, I think it may be fairly
stated that the contribution to the national
well-being of Canada which has been made
and continues to be made by the women of
the press is another evidence of the stability
of character and the loyalty of service which
have characterized the growing position of
women in so many other responsible activities
in our country's affairs. If the Senate is
disposed to give second reading to this bill
and desires to be enlightened further about
its provisions I shall be pleased to move that
it be referred to our Standing Committee
on Miscellaneous and Private Bills, where
officials of the Canadian Women's Press Club
and their legal representative will be present
to answer questions and supply any information that may be desired.
Honourable senators, I have great pleasure
in moving second reading of the bill.
Hon. Arthur W. Roebuck: Honourable senators, I cannot add anything to what the
honourable senior senator from Ottawa (Hon.
M. Lambert) has just said, but I wish to
compliment him on his able and interesting
address.
I feel impelled to say a word of encouragement to the organizers of the Canadian
Women's Press Club and those who are now
in charge of its affairs, and to wish them all
possible success in the future.
The honourable gentleman mentioned the
Toronto Press Club. It may not be very
pertinent, but I happen to be a charter member of that club, and I have as one of my
treasures a membership card-I think it is
dated in 1902-signed by C. H. J. Snider, as
secretary, who later, as some possibly know,
was a trustee under the will of the late John
Ross Robertson, founder of the Toronto
Telegram. For many years Mr. Snider was
one on the publishers of the Telegram, under
whose charge it prospered. A large sum of
money was donated to the Sick Children's
Hospital as a result of John Ross Robertson's
work and of work that was carried on by his
trustees after his death.
As I have said, I can add nothing to what
the honourable senior senator from Ottawa
bas said, and nothing is needed to be added.
I am grateful for the kindness of my fellow
senators in allowing me to voice these words
of encouragement and approval of the bill,
and my compliments to the senator who is
sponsoring it, as well as my best wishes to
the club for the future.
Motion agreed to and bill read second time.

Hon. W. M. Aselline presented Bill S-11,
to amend the Trust Companies Act.
Bill read first time.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Will the honourable
senator give a short explanation of the bill?
Hon. William R. Bruni: Honourable senators, this bill is introduced for the purpose
of tidying up certain legislation as it exists
today with respect to trust companies. It
contains two important parts.
The bill proposes that trust companies be
allowed to amortize their bonds. This right
which at present is enjoyed by banks, insurance companies and mortgage companies
will, by this bill, be extended to trust companies. Secondly, at present trust companies
may loan up to ten times their capital stock
and reserve fund. The bill proposes that
these companies now be allowed to increase
their loans to 12k times their capital stock
and reserve fund.
The Hon. the Acting Speaker: Honourable
senators, when shall this bill be read the

H.on. Arthur W. Roebuck: Honourable senators, there seems to be some confusion as
to the order of routine proceedings under
which we present bills. In the past we
presented them under notices of motions. I
observe that now, and on a number of other
occasions recently, honourable senators are
presenting them under the calling of Presentation of Petitions. If that is the proper
procedureSome Hon. Senators: No.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: May I ask what order
of business we are under?
The Hon. the Acting Speaker: We are proceeding under Presentation of Petitions now.
Hon. John J. Connolly (Otiawa West): Honourable senators, in view of what the honourable senator from Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr.
Roebuck) has said, it might be just as well
to clear the matter up now. I believe it
can be cleared up by reference to the Forms
of Proceeding of the Senate of Canada. Paragraph 64, on page 32, reads:
A senator may bring in a bill after the reading
of petitions, or later if there be no question before
the Chair; but a private bill can only be brought
in after the petition therefor has been favourably
reported upon by the Committee on Standing
Orders.

CANADA-UNITED

STATES RELATIONS

MOTION TO APPROVE SUGGESTED ESTABLISHMENT OF JOINT PARLIAMENTARY
COMMITTEES-DEBATE CONTINUED

The Senate resumed from Thursday, July 3,
the adjourned debate on the motion of Hon.
Mr. Robertson:
Thrt the Senate of Canada welcomes the recent
suggestion of the Prime Minister of Canada for the
establishment of joint parliamentary committees
between Canada and the United States of America,
believes it can be of great benefit in improving
relations between the two countries, and offers our
wholehearted cooperation.

Hon. W. M. Aselline:

Honourable senators,

I wish to congratulate the honourable senator
from Shelburne (Hon. Mr. Robertson) upon
bringing forward this motion. I think that at
this time, when relations between Canada
and the United States of America are so important, a motion of this kind is very opportune, and I welcome the opportunity honourable senators of saying a few words in support
of it.
The motion of the honourable senator from
Shelburne was inspired by a statement made
by our Prime Minister in the course of a
speech delivered at Wesleyan College, Middletown, Connecticut, on June 8, 1958. I thought
it would be interesting if I looked up that
speech and gave honourable senators the exact words that were used on that occasion.

The Prime Minister is reported to have said
as follows:

One of the most encouraging signs of a desire
to bring about the dissolution of potential difiiculties between our countries was that taken by
the House of Representatives Committee on Foreign
Affairs in issuing a special report on May 5, last
on Canadian-American relations which was prepared by Congressmen Brooks Hays of Arkansas
and Frank N. Coffin of Maine.
Then after dealing with some of these
difficulties which were referred to, the Prime
Minister concluded his remarks as follows:
To meet the problem of the relations of our
nations the Hayes-Coffin Report suggested a Congressional Committee on Canadian Relations. I am
sure that the Parliament of Canada would give
fullest consideration to the setting up of a similar
committee of Canadian parliamentarians who in
periodic visits to our respective capitals would do
much to achieve suggested solutions to recurring
problems. The benefits that would flow from such
joint meetings were very apparent in 1942 when
at a parliamentary conference, at which I had the
honour to preside, members of Congress of the
United States met in conference for the first time
with Canadian and Commonwealth members of
Parliament.

Then, honourable senators, a few days
ago we all heard the Prime Minister answering questions on a television program. In
answer to questions he reiterated what he
had stated at Middletown, Connecticut,
namely, that in his opinion meetings of
Canadian parliamentarians with members
of the United States Congress would be most
beneficial, and further that meetings of the
Canadian cabinet with members of the United
States cabinet should also be increased.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: May I ask the honourable senator a question? When the Prime
Minister speaks of members of Parliament
I presume ho means both of the Commons
and the Senate.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: I think so, definitely.
I have here a report of remarks made by
the Prime Minister on television but I do
not propose to read them. His remarks on
television were pretty well a repetition of
what he said at Middletown when he
addressed the college there.
At this point, while it may have no direct
reference to the motion before us, I would
like to recommend to honourable senators
the reading of a speech made recently by
the Honourable Sidney Smith, Secretary of
State for External Affairs, at the International Kiwanis Conference in Chicago. The
title of his speech was "The Friendly Fonce".
I thought it such a good speech that I read
it from the beginning to end. The Secretary
of State for External Affairs disposed of
questions such as oil, zinc, lead, the marketing of wheat and that kind of thing in a
sentence or two, and devoted the greater
part of his address to the long, imaginary
fonce which extends thousands of miles
along the boundary between Canada and the
United States.

JULY 8, 1958
Speeches such as this, I feel, do a great
deal of good. Just how joint committees
could be set up to accomplish what we have
in mind, I am not sure. True, we have had
some experience in that regard: committees
were set up under the NATO Parliamentary
Association, the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association, and some other bodies
mentioned by the honourable senator from
Shelburne. Although there may be some
difficulty in establishing these committees
I feel sure that the necessary machinery
can be put to work without too much
trouble.
The honourable senator from Shelburne
told us something about the NATO Parliamentary Association. I recall when in 1955
he, then the honourable Speaker of this
chamber, called me into his office and we discussed this subject at considerable length.
The honourable Speaker, as he then was, told
me that up to that time NATO had been
dealing principally with military matters, but
he felt the time had come when something
should be done under Part II of the NATO
Agreement, having to do with the economic
relationships between NATO countries. He
had talks with other senators and with some
members of the House of Commons, which
resulted in the formation in this country
of the Canadian NATO Parliamentary
Association.
When that association was established the
honourable senator from Shelburne took great
pains to arrange for a subsequent meeting
of representatives of the 15 NATO countries in Paris. He went to England, interviewed important parliamentarians there and
convinced them that this was an important
step. Later on it was my good fortune to be
one of the delegates to attend that conference
in Paris, along with some 20 other Canadian
Parliamentarians.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Did not the senator
from Shelburne become president of that
association?
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: I am just coming to
that part of my story.
When the meeting assembled in Paris the
honourable senator from Shelburne was
elected president of the association. He conducted himself so well and made such a fine
presentation in his initial speech that I was
prompted to go to him and congratulate him
on the fine effort he had made and to tell
him how proud we as delegates were of his
performance. I may add that I later told his
wife of our feelings in this respect, and she,
of course, was quite pleased.
The NATO Parliamentary Association has
been meeting yearly ever since. As I said, it
met first in 1955; it met again in 1956 and in

1957. Although the assembled NATO nations
did not agree to form individual NATO Parliamentary Associations, still I believe a lot
of good came from the meetings that were
held. The representatives of the various
countries gained much by sitting around a big
table and talking over their difficulties. A
delegate could attach a headpiece which
would bring him a simultaneous translation
in French or in English of speeches being
made.
Honourable senators, I regard the work of
this association as an advanced step. If
something could be done with respect to the
setting up of joint committees between Canada and the United States along the same
lines on which this association is set up, I
am sure it would tend to solve many of the
difficulties that arise between our two
countries.
That completes my remarks on the NATO
Parliamentary Association, but I should like
to say a few words at this time about the
Commonwealth Parliamentary Association and
the benefits derived from the meeting of
Parliamentarians from the commonwealth
countries every two years.
As honourable senators know, I was a
member of the Canadian delegation which
went to India last November, and with the
leave of the house I propose to say something
about that trip, this being my first opportunity to do so since my return.
The meeting was to be held in New Delhi
in December, and the delegates left Canada
on November 7. The plan was that we were
to go by way of London, England, where
we were to meet delegates from other commonwealth countries who had assembled
there, and proceed with them on to Pakistan,
where we were to spend a week or more visiting with governors, parliamentarians and
businessmen, and discussing problems of all
kinds with officials and the man on the street.
When we had made a tour of Pakistan we
were to go on to Ceylon and spend a similar
week there; then return to India for a week
or ten days before going on to the conference
at New Delhi.
I thought the Canadian delegation was
rather a good one. It was composed of six
members from the House of Commons: two
Conservatives, two Liberals, one from the
Social Credit party and one from the C.C.F.
party, and I represented the Senate-that is,
seven members of Parliament-and a representative from the Legislature of British
Columbia, as well as the Speakers of the
Legislative Assemblies of Saskatchewan, Ontario and Newfoundland, and the AttorneyGeneral for the province of Nova Scotia. This
made a total of 11 delegates in all.

SENATE
Hon. Mr. Reid: Who was the delegate from
the British Columbia Legislature?
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Mr. Tom Bate. I presume
my honourable friend from New Westminster
(Hon. Mr. Reid) is acquainted with him. We
found Mr. Bate to be a very presentable young
man who was of great assistance to us in
meeting other Commonwealth parliamentarians and citizens of the various countries
we visited. We also had a secretary. Mr.
George Doucett, member of Parliament for
Lanark, was the leader of our delegation. I
must say he was most acceptable to everyone
and he did an excellent job in keeping our
delegates in order and seeing to it that they
carried out the duties they were supposed
to perform.
Honourable senators, as I have already said
we left Canada on November 7. We arrived
in London, England, the following day, and
at the airport there we met a great many
parliamentarians from the United Kingdom.
We had a conference with them that lasted
for several hours that same day, and we met
with them again the next day because our
aircraft to Karachi was a little late in departing. During this interval we met the
delegates from Trinidad, Jamaica, the Bahamas, and other commonwealth countries in
the Caribbean, and became well acquainted
with them before we left for Karachi.
We proceeded from London by way of
Rome and Baghdad. We were fortunate enough
to pass over a great part of the Middle East
on a perfect, sunny day, with the result that
we saw everything from the eastern end of
the Mediterranean Sea right through the
Syrian Desert, the source of the Tigris and
Euphrates Rivers, to the Persian Gulf, and
on to Karachi, the capital of Pakistan.
As honourable senators are aware, Pakistan
is a Moslem state which was formerly a part
of the Indian Empire. I think that is the
way I should describe it. We found they had
a big problem in that country. There is West
Pakistan and East Pakistan, which are a
thousand miles apart. The total population
is approximately 80 million, with 35 million
living in West Pakistan and the remainder in
East Pakistan. While they have no monsoons
in West Pakistan, there is an annual rain
fall of 110 inches in East Pakistan. As West
Pakistan is very dry it has to resort to irrigation schemes so as to preserve and store up
every drop of rain water.
Ten years ago the capital of Pakistan,
the comparatively new city of Karachi,
was a small place of a few thousand

thriving centre of 2 million. They have a big
refugee problem there, for when India was
divided a million or so refugees moved into

and around Karachi itself. It is a desert port
and when flying in or out of it one sees little
vegetation for hundreds of miles in any direction. Karachi is developing into a wonderful
city and I believe I saw there the largest
textile mill I have seen in my life. We were
told it consisted of a thousand looms, that
the plant was working around the clock, 24
hours daily, and producing enough textiles,
cloth and that kind of product to supply the
whole country of Pakistan. Karachi is an
ocean port with a splendid shipyard and oil
refineries and other industries, but what I
was most interested in was the written
constitution of Pakistan. I was able to get a
copy of it and I read it from cover to cover.
I was simply delighted with it. If the people
of Pakistan live up to their constitution we
need have no fear of communism in their
country.
The hospitality extended to us was almost
overpowering and we had a hard time living
up to it. When we arrived in Karachi the
temperature was 100 degrees Fabrenhoit and
we were not properly clothed for such hot
weather. I complained a bit about it and I
was told: "It is winter here now. You should
be here in the summer when the temperature
goes to 135 degrees. You shouldn't complain
when it is only 100 degrees. This is quite
nice winter wveather." However, te heat did
give us some trouble, and in particular we
found difficulty in getting to sleep at night
in that temperature. Then we had a certain
amount of trouble with the food. In fact,
we never did get used to it, although we were
told that in time we would. The food was
plentiful and good but it wasn't what we
had been used to. Althougb we had been
inoculated against everything under the sun
except malaria, we seemed to contract dysentery and many other things. Despite this, I
don't believe that for the first three weeks
any of us missed very much. Later on, when
we were in Ceylon, most of us came down
with the Asiatic 'flu and at that time we had
to renege on some of the trips that were
organized for us.
We met very many fine people in Pakistan,
particularly in Karachi; they were fine looking people, and they all spoke English. We
had no trouble in communicating with them
to find out what their difficulties were. Newspapers in English were at our bedroom door
every morning. The bookstalls were full of
publications in English. In fact, we might
almost have felt we were in an Englishspeaking country, except for the slightly
darker complexion of most of the people.
We could even make ourselves understood

about half a rupee, or ten cents. We were
very happy with our visit in Karachi, and
we learned a lot about their Government
and met a great many of their officials. We
met the Canadian High Commissioner and
also the United Kingdom High Commissioner.
Finally, we had to leave, and we went on
to a beautiful place a little farther north,
Lahore. Although Lahore is quite a beauty
spot and the capital of West Pakistan, it was
there that I was bitten by the malaria
mosquito, so perhaps I should not say too
much of a complimentary nature about the
city. In Lahore, where we had a very busy
time, I was allocated to stay with the
Governor of the province.
Honourable senators, on that trip I was
guilty for the first time in my life of keeping a diary, and with your permission
I would like to read one page out of it which
deals with part of the time we spent in the
beautiful city of Lahore. It is dated Saturday, November 16, 1957:
Had a good night's sleep. This is our tenth day
since leaving Ottawa. It seems much longer, and
there will be 31 days more of it. Have taken about
two rolls of movies. Hope they turn out well.
This morning, after tea at seven, had a bath,
shave and breakfast. At eight o'clock we went
for a walk in the park here at Government House.
Took some movies, etc., then drove down in our
Cadillac to join the other delegates at the hotel;
after which we inspected the railway shops, where
17,000 people are employed. The Pakistan railways
are Government owned and this is the centre where
all of the work, repairs, etc. are performed. Everyone seemed to be working very hard. Unskilled
labour in the shops receive 11 rupees per day, about
30 cents Canadian, skilled labour in the shops receive
21 rupees per day, about
70 cents Canadian.
Labour is plentiful and cheap. We were told they
work 48 hours a week, with Saturday afternoon off.
That would make about 81 hours a day. There was
another tour of an engineering works which I
begged off and returned to Government House for
a rest before lunch, which we are having there
by ourselves at 1.30. Hope I can eat something.
At 4.15 we go to University of Punjab for a reception on the University Hall lawns, and at 8 p.m.
we attend a formal dinner given by the Premier
of West Pakistan. Thank goodness I brought my
black bow tie.
It is a glorious day, with temperature about the
same as a fine Saskatchewan September day, much
nicer than Karachi, where it was about 90 degrees
Fahrenheit. I am trying to drink some Lahore
beer but am having a hard time of it--quite flat,
warm and insipid.

I might say here that we were not supposed to drink the water unless it had been
boiled for some hours, and some of us did
not have a good drink of water for six
weeks; we had to drink either Coca Cola
or beer or something of that kind. The diary
continues:
We stay here Sunday, then off by air to Peshawar
and the Khyber Pass-should be interesting.
There are more horses and donkeys here than
at Karachi, which is in desert territory, and where
camels of one and two humps are very plentiful.

It is 10 p.m. Have just come back from the Premier's
dinner at the Gymkhana Club. This is another
very old beautiful building situate in spacious
grounds, with great trees and lawns and flowers.
The people of this country go in for magnificent
buildings. Seems they spend most of their income
on erecting huge, beautiful structures. The law
courts are most artistic and impressive. Hope to
get a picture of them tomorrow. Had a nice
afternoon at the university; talked philosophy,
religion, engineering, law, farming, etc. Met some
nice Americans from New York attached to the
legation here. Had another one of those highly
spiced buffet dinners. Ate very little. Believe I'm
losing weight. Hope to be able to locate a good
beefsteak some of these days; and couldn't I
enjoy one of my wife's roast beef and Yorkshire
pudding dinners!
Even some Red River cereal
would go good. Well, we have a full day tomorrow.
We visit Emperor Jehanrig's Tomb, go to a big
garden party in Shalamar Gardens, horse races,
and finally another dinner at the Falettis Hotel
given by the West Pakistan Commonwealth Association. So I'm off to bed and a good rest, I
hope.

Day after day we carried on in that way.
As I have said, a couple of days later we
left for the far north, which, by the way,
was a little cooler.
Hon. Mr. Paterson: May I ask the senator
if there were any wild ducks there?
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Oh, I saw plenty of
wild things. They have good quail shooting
out of Madras. In fact, the dietitian in the
hospital where I was confined for some three
weeks, an English girl, used to go out in
the mornings and shoot quail and snipe,
and roast one or two of them for me, and
I would have them for dinner in the evening.
But I did not hear of any shooting of ducks.
In any event, I was not in a condition to
do much hunting.
Finally, we left Lahore, where we had
met many fine people and parliamentarians
from all over the country, including Indian
senators who were with the delegates on
the trip. We also met people who were doing
hard work in the shops and engineering
works, and had many, many conversations
with them. One day I got lost and was trying
to find my way back to the bus, when I
met two young fellows and asked them how
to find my way. They showed me around.
During our conversation I found that they
spoke good English and were well informed
on a great many subjects. But how they
did hate the English! I could not understand
it. They did not give England credit for all
the railways she had built, or the beautiful
university, the hard surfaced roads, or the
wonderful hospitals and other buildings.
They were the most ungrateful pair of young
fellows I had ever met in my life. However,
that was more or less unusual.
Under the Colombo Plan, Canada is building an enormous dam, called the Warsak.
It is over 1,100 miles from Karachi. We got

SENATE
on the plane and travelled to within 100 miles
of this dam; then we travelled for 100 miles
by bus and automobile, getting there about
noon. We inspected the dam, having been
taken there by the Canadian engineers. About
150 Canadians were working on the dam,
with 5,000 natives. It will be completed in
about two years time and will cost us about
$60 million. The wages paid on that project
to labourers are one and one half rupees a
day. That is equivalent to 30 cents. But
there are quite a number of experienced
labourers on the project and the average
wage is about $1 a day. That is the equivalent
of five rupees.
We were much impressed by this work.
They had diverted the river through a
mountain and they had tunnelled west for
the irrigation works when the dam is completed. The dam will supply 100,000 horse
power and some 200,000 or 300,000 acres of
land will be irrigated following completion
of the dam. I could see that that would be
a good thing because when we left the dam
site, after we had had a wonderful meal
with the Canadian engineers---ham, spaghetti,
chicken, and everything, a real Canadian
dinner-we travelled some 30 or 40 miles to
the entrance of the Khyber Pass through a
desert area without seeing a tree or shrub of
any kind. At one time it was under cultivation but it bas gone back to nature. That is
the type of territory that will be irrigated
by the water from this dam.
We motored 35 miles through the Khyber
Pass right to the borders of Afghanistan
where we were prohibited from going any
further.
The pass runs through the Hindo Koosh
Mountains. There is a good hard-surfaced
road, and a wonderfully built railroad with
a rock road-bed, and also there is the old
camel trail that was used by Alexander the
Great when he invaded India from the north.
But the mountains there are devoid of
vegetation of every kind. Throughout the
whole length of the Khyber Pass it is still
well fortified. I said the pass was devoid
of vegetation of every kind. Not a tree, not
a shrub, just these little pill boxes built up
on the sides of the mountains where soldiers
were on guard. After taking a few moving
pictures of the border area between Pakistan
and Afghanistan we went back to headquarters at the Warsak Dam, where Mr.
Murphy, one of our delegates, the member
of Parliament for Sarnia, and Mr. Doucett
made certain speeches thanking everybody for
what they had done for us. Then we returned
1,105 miles after dark, all the way, to Karachi.
It was a very profitable day, although a
very fatiguing one, but we wanted to find

out what Canada was doing under the
Colombo Plan for Pakistan in the north.
The next day we took the plane for Ceylon.
I am not going to say much about Ceylon,
except that it is a very beautiful island, a
regular paradise. The vegetation grows right
down to the shoreline of the ocean and
continues to the top of the highest mountains.
The cocoanut palms were loaded with nuts.
There were great rubber plantations, great
tea plantations, banana trees, rice fields
and all that kind of thing.
We found Ceylon very much westernized.
There we saw thousands of buses, both single
and double deckers, hundreds of motorcars,
hard-surfaced roads; the people were well
dressed and looked prosperous, and they
spoke English quite well. The exports of tea,
rubber, cocoa, precious stones exceeded their
imports. Canada has been teaching them
modern methods of fishing, under the Colombo
Plan.
The first level of vegetation is the palm
trees, and they grow to a level of several
hundreds of feet all around the island. Then
on the next elevation are the rubber plantations, and at the very top the tea is grown.
We met very many people in Ceylon that
we liked very much, including the Governors
of the different provinces and the members of
their Parliament. They also have a fine
democratic constitution and we rather regretted to leave that country.
I want honourable members to understand
that all the time we were travelling about
these countries meeting these different people
we were also meeting and communicating
with the delegates from every part of the
commonwealth, finding out what their
troubles and difficulties were and what we
might be able to do for them some time in
the future, with the result that after two or
three days of working and talking with these
people we knew quite a lot about them and
they knew quite a lot about us.
But it was in Ceylon that most of us were
taken ill with Asiatic flu and other ailments,
and some of us had to renege on some of the
trips that had been planned for us. But we
finally left there for India on the 25th of
November, landing in Madras, which is the
oldest English settlement in India. That is
where forces were sent from to relieve the
situation after the prisoners were suffocated
in the "Black Hole of Calcutta". Madras is
where Wellington, the "Iron Duke", learned
how to provision an army and gained experience which helped him in the Peninsular
War in Spain.
At any rate, after arriving in Madras I
attended a wonderful reception given by the
Governor. After the reception I went to

JULY 8, 1958
Mahatma Gandhi's tomb, which is a beautiful structure built in the form of an amphitheatre. After that we attended a theatre
where we saw Indian folk dancing for two
hours. We then returned to the hotel where
we had a big commonwealth parliamentary
dinner. That night I went to bed feeling fine,
to sleep for the first time in an air-conditioned
room. I woke the next morning feeling well,
had breakfast with the Canadian delegation,
went out for a drive, and within five minutes
was struck down with malaria. My temperature went up to 106 and my blood pressure
dropped 100 points. That was when cablegrams
were sent back to Canada asking whether my
body should be embalmed or cremated. Mr.
Doucett was asked to put up $800 for cremation, and a price of $10,000 was suggested as
the cost of everything required to be done
should I pass away. In fact, these people
seemed to take great delight in spending my
money while I was lying on my back in the
nursing home.
I should mention that one of the physicians
I had-and I had four very capable medical
men-has since become the Governor of
Madras. The doctors, the nurses and my
dietitian all spoke English. I am bound to
say this about the Government of India:
they never let us down. If anybody got sick
they cared for them to the limit.
I should like -also to say that the Canadians in Madras were very good to us. The
former head of the Ford Motor Car Company of Canada-which company went out
of business when India prohibited the
importation of cars-and his wife visited
me nearly every day; they wrote my telegrams and sent my letters and messages.
There were also some Canadian people from
Little Current, a town on Manitoulin Island,
who were kind to me. The Canadian High
Commissioner sent a special man from New
Delhi to stay with me; the High Commissioner of the United Kingdom extended the
same favour. With all this care, I certainly
have nothing to complain about in so far as
my treatment in Madras is concerned.
Honourable senators, there are many more
things I could say. I might mention the
type of fuel that is used in that part of the
world: the upper classes use kerosene, but
a very small quantity is required for cooking. The droppings of animals are not allowed
to go to waste, but are dried out and used
as fuel for cooking throughout almost all of
India and Pakistan. In Bombay one of the
biggest industries is the shipping of kerosene
to all parts of the East. Thousands of ships
leave every month loaded with four-gallon
cans of kerosene.
One sees in that part of the country great
salt marshes from which salt is procured.

There are many large -diesel engine f actories
for the manufacture of motors to run the
buses. Two kinds of cars are now being
manufactured, the Italian Fiat and the Dodge,
and India now permits the importation of
parts for the repair of cars sold there before
the prohibition went into effect.
Although I never did get to New Delhi,
I made arrangements that the two or three
speeches that I was to have delivered were
delivered by other members of the party. I
have since read those speeches, and I regard
them as a big improvement on what I had
intended to say.
May I add that throughout the whole trip
we were quite pleased with the progress
that we made in meeting with these people and talking over our mutual troubles
with them. We were of the opinion that the
Commonwealth Parliamentary Association
was a fine institution and should be encouraged.
Hon. Mr. Boebuck: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: All of these agencies for
good will and understanding are in my opinion very important. I wholeheartedly endorse
the suggestions made by our Prime Minister,
and I feel that if they are brought into
effect they will from time to time be the
means of solving any problems which may
arise between Canada and the United States.
I am very strongly in favour of the setting
up of the proposed joint Parliamentary committees so that they may carry on their
deliberations and meet frequently, not just
when there is trouble, but so that trouble
may never arise.
Hon. W. Ross Macdonald: Honourable
senators, 1 do not intend to delay the house
at any length tonight; my remarks will not
be very extended.
I rise to endorse wholeheartedly and without reservation of any kind the motion that
has been so ably presented to us by the
honourable senator from Shelburne (Hon. Mr.
Robertson). I approve of everything he said
in his speech and trust that his motion will
receive unanimous approval by this house.
Honourable senators, we have all listened
tonight with great interest to the address
just delivered by the honourable Leader of
the Government (Hon. Mr. Aseltine). He has
given us a very vivid picture of his trip to
India, Pakistan and Ceylon. In fact, the picture he paints is so vivid that his presentation might be called an illustrated lecture.
But I am sure that what pleases us most is
the fact that, although while on his trip he
had a very grave illness, he has completely
recovered from it and is now with us ta lead
this house.

SENATE
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Honourable senators,
I too have had some association with the
Commonwealth Parliamentary Association. In
fact, I joined that organization when I
entered the House of Commons in 1935. At
that time it was known as the Empire Parliamentary Association; it subsequently had
its name changed to British Commonwealth
Parliamentary Association; then it was
changed to the name which it bears today,
the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association. It includes representatives from all
commonwealth countries. During the time I
have been associated with this organization I
have been one of its joint presidents, and I
have been chairman of its Executive Committee. The splendid work it has accomplished has not always appeared in the form
of legislation; in fact, it has no power as a
legislative assembly. All that the members
can do is gather together from all parts of
the commonwealth to discuss mutual problems in a friendly way, but when they part
they feel they know one another better than
they did when they first assembled. The
National Parliamentary Association is a splendid organization, and I would recommend
that all members here who do not belong
should hasten to join it.
The resolution which is before us reads:
That the Senate of Canada welcomes the recent
suggestion of the Prime Minister of Canada for the
establishment of joint parliamentary committees
between Canrda and the United States of America,
believes it can be of great benefit in improving
relations between the two countries, and offers our
wholehearted co-operation.

I would refer honourable senators particularly to the last part of this resolution, the
words "... believes it can be of great benefit

in improving relations between the two countries..." I am one of those who believe
that our relations have not deteriorated to
any great extent. We have been good friends
for many years. We have, of course, had our
differences but on the whole they have been
more imaginary than real and they have
been grossly exaggerated. We have had
not only close tics of friendship but blood
tics as well. We are members of one family,
and of course there are quarrels in families.
A quarrel does not break up a family; it
often brings the members closer together. The
keeping of our relations on a high plane bas
been the object of our governments over the
years. I will be very glad to read the speech
which was recommended to us tonight by
the honourable Leader of the Government
(Hon. Mr. Aseltine). When he referred to
it I thought he was giving a slight political
tinge to the setting up of the proposed committees. I want to keep away from any

suggestion that I am sounding a political note,
but I would remind the house that over the
years the Liberal administrations have been
maintaining, by their acts, the present high
standard of friendship which exists between
Canada and the United States.
For evidence of this, honourable senators
need only refer back to the attitude which
the Liberal Government took in 1911 to
maintain friendly relations between our
two countries. I would also remind the house
of what Mr. Mackenzie King went through
during the early days of his régime to maintain these same relations, and the efforts
of Mr. St. Laurent's administration to keep
them on a high plane. I mention these things
merely because I thought that too much
emphasis was being put by the Leader of
the Government on the fact that this resolution was based on a suggestion of the Prime
Minister. I give him full credit, but I do
say it is just following the doctrine that has
been a principle of the Liberal party ever
since Sir Wilfrid Laurier came into power in
1896.
Hon. Mr. Howard: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Along with the
speeches recommended to us for reading by
the Leader of the Government, I have no
hesitation in recommending the speeches
delivered recently in the United States by the
Leader of the Opposition in the House of
Commons (Hon. Mr. Pearson) and by the
Right Honourable C. D. Howe, former
Minister of Trade and Commerce. I am
sorry that I have not got the dates on which
those speeches were delivered.
Honourable senators, I make this statement
merely to emphasize that this resolution is
sponsored by a member sitting on this side
of the house and it has no political implications whatsoever. No matter to what political
party we belong, I am sure we are all anxious
that Canada and the United States should
maintain the high standard of friendship
which now exists between them. There are
bound to be differences of opinion when we
have such close trading relations. We are
each other's most important customers. For
instance, 63 per cent of our exports go to the
United States and 73 per cent of our imports
come from that country. The United States
sells more to Canada than it does to all Latin
American countries or to all the countries
on the continent of Europe. Without a doubt
Canada is the best customer of the United
States, and that country is the best customer
of Canada. Little things may annoy us. There
is no doubt we annoyed the Americans when
it was suggested that a certain percentage
of our trade be diverted from their country;
and they annoyed us by their policy of

JULY 8, 1958
disposing of agricultural surpluses and their
constant threat to impose higher tariffs upon
codfish, lead, zinc and plywood, imported
from Canada and to reduce the importation
of Canadian petroleum by 15 per cent. While
these matters disturb and upset us, it is
absolutely untrue to say that Canadians are
becoming anti-American. There is no basis
whatsoever for that. As I say, there are
differences of opinion and we feel in some
respects they should be more generous toward
us; and doubtless they have similar feelings
about us. There have been misunderstandings,
but this resolution seeks for a better understanding between our two countries, and I
am confident that the proposed committees
could do much to create and maintain that
understanding.
Honourable senators, this suggestion for
joint committees is meeting with the approval
of the United States Senate. From reports in
the press it appears that the United States
will heartily approve the setting up of such
a committee. The Senate Foreign Relations
Committee is at present giving consideration
to the proposal, and if there is a favourable
reaction in Canada, as I am sure there will
be, it is likely that a permanent subcommittee on United States-Canada relations will
be set up in the United States.
Harold Greer, a Toronto Star staff correspondent in Washington, reports Senator
George Aiken, Republican, of Vermont, as
having stated that:
If our two countries had reciprocal subcommittees
of Congress and the Canadian Parliament that could
meet and discuss matters of common interest, we
would not only have a better understanding of
legislative matters but could better convey the
substance of that understanding to the American
people.

It appears, therefore, that the setting up
of these committees will be approved by the
Government of the United States and by the
Government of Canada.
It seems to me that there is a definite
limit to what these committees can achieve. I

are, in my opinion, just a little grandiose.
Here are some of the suggestions made for
discussion:
(1) Methods which could be taken up by not
only Canada and the United States but other
western powers to "meet the Communist world
economic offensive".
(2) Means of expanding world trade and particularly to overcome problems between Canada
and the United States developing out of the U.S.
surplus wheat disposal program and U.S. restrictions on imports of Canadian oil.
(3) The need of a change in U.S. laws or regulations which prohibit Canadian subsidiaries of U.S.
firms to deal with Communist China in nonstrategic commodities.

Honourable senators, these are all very
valuable suggestions as to matters on which
the people of both countries should be informed. But are not these matters primarily
problems to be resolved by the cabinets
of the two countries, matters which will
require a certain amount of bargaining and
give-and-take on the part of both? Indeed,
we might consider these things; but the idea
of this committee having legislative authority
is just not so; we have no legislative authority.
I believe that the committee which it is now
proposed to set up would accomplish more
if its aim were not to bring about a better
bargain for the particular country from which
the members of the committee come, but
rather to maintain the sincere spirit of
friendship which now exists between us,
and even to strengthen and develop it so
that our two peoples will always understand each other, and that we will continue
to live in peace side by side with each other
over the years to come, as we have done
during almost the last 150 years. I believe
the committee could do more by the members
of both countries associating frequently
with each other. It should meet sometimes
in Canada so that Canadians would get to
know the American members of the committee better. It should sometimes meet in
the United States so that Americans would
get to know the Canadian members of the
committee better. I believe it should be
primarily a friendship committee to maintain the spirit of friendship which I say now
prevails.
Recently there appeared an editorial in
the Ottawa Journal of June 12, 1958, which
appealed to me very much, bearing the
heading, "Have Them Play Golf Together."
May I read part of that editorial:

this resolution. But I may say at once that
I am not only in favour of the resolution to me, as chairman of our committee, saying
wholeheartedly, but I am also very anxious that he hoped it would be possible to hold
to sec that something is done about it. I the meeting later on in February of the folam interested at the moment in supplement- lowing year. Unfortunately, other important

JULY 8, 1958
and our joint meeting was never held, but
the willingness to do so was there. The desire
to co-operate with us in dealing with problems of common interest was there. I have
often thought that had that contact been followed up, out of it might have developed a
great deal in the way of mutual advantage
to both countries.
There were other occasions after the war
ended when contact between this country and
the United States in matters of mutual advantage, in trade, might have come to much more
if they had been followed up more vigorously
on each side with the object of achieving
actual working relations.
My honourable friend the new senator from
Winnipeg South (Hon. Mr. Thorvaldson)
knows well the possibilities of contact that
have developed out of the joint meetings of
the Chambers of Commerce of these two
countries. I attended a most memorable session of the International Chamber of Commerce at the Seigniory Club in the early
forties, when the whole field that is being
considered in this resolution was under discussion. It seems to me that many of the
objectives were just as sound then as they are
now. But as distance and time separated us
from the urgencies of war years they faded
in their significance and importance. We
were willing to do anything then and we
did do a great deal in the way of co-operation
with the United States in the pooling of our
resources and finances to achieve the successful end of the war. Later other problems
seemed to intervene, and those burning objectives of the times seemed to pale and weaken,
and we have fallen away.
I think that this resolution, so far as it
goes, is a most admirable one, and I trust, as
I said in the beginning, that something concrete and definite will come out of it, because
one is convinced that the feeling of the people
of this country and also those of the United
States is strongly favourable to such contact
and such co-operation.
I do not intend to say any more at the
moment, but there is just one thing that I
want to suggest at this time as a real background for this resolution. It is the definite
data and factual information to back up what
I have said about the mutual desires of the
people on both sides of the boundary to support such rapprochement between the two
countries.
It was my privilege the other day when
presenting the report of the Committee on
External Relations on the NORAD pact to
refer to this general aspect of international
interest. At that time I was sorely tempted to
say more than I di.d, but as chairman of the
committee I felt that my chief duty was to
submit the report.

In the thirties and early forties there appeared a series of very valuable contributions
called, "A Series of Studies Prepared Under
the Direction of the Carnegie Endowment for
International Peace." The American-Born in
Canada, one of the volumes in this series,
which I have in my hand, outlines a longstanding relationship between Canada and the
United States. The editors and the authors of
this book are Dr. R. H. Coats, founder of the
Department of Statistics of Canada, now retired, and his associate at that time, Mr. M. C.
Maclean. This book is the most authoritative
statistical analysis of the relations of American-born citizens of Canada to the economic
development of this country that is in existence anyw'here, and I therefore suggest that
anyone who is truly interested in the proposals
contained in this resolution should have reference to it. The book to which I referred in
a speech a couple of weeks ago, the North
Atlantic Triangle, by Brebner, is equally
worth while. These two books will convince
any fair-minded patriotic citizen of this country of the common interests, aims and sympathies that prevail between the peoples of
these two countries.
I should like to quote one short passage
from this book to show the human and social
background of this resolution. Speaking of the
American-born in Canada, the authors use
these words:
The American-born are spread more widely, that
is, they are found in

more parts of Canada, than

are the native-born of any other country except
England and Canada itself. ... Even such 'unlikely'
regions as the Abitibi District of Quebec, the
northernmost parts of Manitoba and Saskatchewan,
and the Northwest Territories are well represented
by American-born.

There is reason, in view of this investigation, for the statement that the American-born

in Canada is the highest of the foreign-born
populations in this country, in wideness of distribution, in distribution by counties and by
municipalities. Not one of our federal electoral
districts is without a percentage of Americanborn immigrants among its citizens. Added
to that number are those who have been born
as a result of marriages of Canadian-American
parents. More than one million people in
Canada can trace their origin directly to the
other side of the boundary line. On the other
side of the picture, Canada has made its contribution to the society of the United States
and to the economic development of that country, where for more than 200 years the work
of some 5J million people who either migrated
from Canada in the first place, or are children
of those migrants is represented.
With that mutual background of human
interest and importance, it seems to me that
a duty rests upon the representatives of the
Canadian people in Parliament-and I would

SENATE
like to emphasize that a particular duty lies
with the members of this chamber-in relation to this proposal. I think that the opportunity of capitalizing the advantages that may
arise out of this resolution is something
which should particularly concern the Senate
of Canada and the Senate of the United States.
In saying that, I am simply following up in
my own mind the favourable impressions I
received when I had to go to the United States
in 1943 to approach this whole problem of
co-operation in relation to our common
economie problems.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Turgeon, debate
adjourned.

CANADA-UNITED

STATES RELATIONS

MOTION TO APPROVE SUGGESTED ESTABLISHMENT OF JOINT PARLIAMENTARY
COMMITTEES-AGREED TO

The Senate resumed from yesterday the
adjourned debate on the motion of Hon. Mr.
Robertson:
That the Senate of Canada welcomes the recent
suggestion of the Prime Minister of Canada for the
establishment of joint parliamentary committees
between Canada and the United States of America,
believes it can be of great benefit in improving
relations between the two countries, and offers our
wholehearted co-operation.

Hon. Gray Turgeon: Honourable senators,
I do not intend to detain the Senate very
long this afternoon in discussing this resolution, but I do consider it an honour to have
the opportunity of saying a few words on the
motion of the honourable senator from Shelburne (Hon. Mr. Robertson).
As pointed out by the honourable Leader
of the Opposition (Hon. Mr. Macdonald),
there is no question whatever that the relations between Canada and the United States
through many, many years have not all been
excellent. First of all, let me say that it
seems to me there are several other reasons

SENATE
for passing a resolution of this kind and for
carrying it out in all its expectations. So far
as good relations are concerned, naturally
everything has not been definitely perfect.
I want to pay a word of respect to the
President of the United States for his visit
here and for the excellent address which he
gave us this morning. In relation to this
particular motion which is now under discussion I want to make a very short quotation
from the speech made by President Eisenhower this morning. Naturally, like members
of the Senate, he was definitely of the opinion
that conditions were very good, yet this is
what he had to say:
Our forms of government-though both cast in
the democratic pattern-are greatly different. Indeed,
sometimes it appears that many of our misunderstandings spring from an imperfect knowledge on
the part of both of us of the dissimilarities in our
forms of government.

Now, honourable senators, I cannot conceive of any better way of settling a problem
caused by uncertainty of conditions than by
the operation of a committee representing
both the Parliament of Canada and the Congress of the United States, along the lines
proposed to this chamber by the honourable
senator from Shelburne.

In his speech the President went on to
say:
And yet, despite these dissimilarities in form,
our two Governments are developing, and are increasingily using effective ways to consult and act
together. This we do to meet the problens that
confront us in our relations with each other, and
in the relations of both with other nations of
the world.

It appears, therefore, to me, as I am sure
it does to every honourable senator, that this
particular recommendation, based upon the
excellent relations between the two countries,
will at the moment do a great deal of good
not only in settling the difficulties that already exist, but in clearing the way so that
difficulties of that nature will not come into
being at a later date.
I intend to mention one or two of the
main problems which exist; in doing so, I
shall be speaking largely as a British Columbian, though I am sure the feeling on the
part of the citizens of that province are
shared by the citizens of the rest of Canada.
I refer first to the problem of the Alaska
panhandle. This matter is of considerable
seriousness, and I shall deal with it in detail
later.
To come back to the question of good relations between Canada and the United States,
there exist several forms of difficulties. I
have mentioned the Alaska panhandle problem. Another one-and I again speak as a
British Columbian, though the question is
a familiar one in other parts of Canada-is

the development of power on the Columbia
River. As most of us will remember, back in
1909 Canada and the United States-through
the making of the Boundary Waters Treaty
-acted
together in the setting up of the
International Joint Commission, the purpose
of which was to deal with and settle problems arising out of the so-called boundary
rivers.
At this point I should like to quote a short
passage from some remarks I made a few
years ago before an international conference:
The late Mr. Lawrence J. Burpee, one time
Secretary of the Canadian section of the commission, writing of articles 3 and 4 of the Boundary
Waters Treaty said:
"-to
the extent covered by these articles, the
United States and Canada transferred to this International Tribunal a measure of their national
sovereignty."

I believe this is correct, that they did give
up a part of their national sovereignty to the
commission that was set up, representing in
equal numbers the two countries. I then
went on to say:
I endorse Mr. Burpee's statement and say that
this treaty affected certain very important rights
and privileges of each of the two neighbouring
countries. And when we recall that the treaty was
between a very strong and powerful nation, the
United States, and Great Britain, acting for Canada,
a snall neighbour lacking the full sovereign
authority which Canada now has, we find a positive
answer of "false!" to the communist instigated
charges that the United States lias imperialistic
designs upon the rights or possessions of other
countries.

It is of interest to go back in our minds
ta 1909, to a time when Canada did not have
anything like the world position she has
today, and when a country like the United
States decided to enter into a treaty of this
nature it was, as the secretary of the Canadian branch of the Commission said, a giving
away of some of its sovereign rights; and in
turn, we of course gave away some of our

rights. Therefore, there could not be anything but good will in the general feeling of
the United States toward us. That good will
is not only in the minds of the people at
large, but also in

the executive

administra-

tion, and as well in the parliamentary and
congressional groups. Had that not been the

case the treaty could never have been
executed, or ratified by the American
Congress.
I come back to the question of the Alaska
panhandle. I do not wish to go into a
detailed statement with respect to it, except
to say that without any question the panhandle is interfering with the development
of the northwestern part of Canada, and the
time has come when all of Canada, even the
people in the far eastern parts, are looking
forward to that development. I believe it
will be retarded unless and until some

JULY
arrangement can be made with Alaska in
connection with the Panhandle.
As a Canadian I wish to congratulate the
people of Alaska, since at long last they
have been incorporated into the union of
the United States of America and have been
given statehood. I have had experiences
from an international point of view with
some representatives of Alaska, and although
Alaska may not agree that action should be
taken in connection with the Panhandle at
this moment, I feel certain that they are
ready to sit down and discuss matters with
us. They will now have two senators and
a member of the House of Representatives
in the American Congress, and if we could
set up with them a joint committee I feel
certain that we could bring about fruitful
conversations with them.
The honourable senior senator from Ottawa
(Hon. Mr. Lambert) yesterday made reference to an experience he had some years
ago when he was Chairman of the Senate
Committee on Reconstruction. He referred
to the conversation that he and I had when
I was Chairman of a similar committee in
the House of Commons. I should like to read
one of the resolutions that our committee
put forward:
We recommend that an agricultural, industrial,
mineral and tranzportation survey be made of the
northwestern portion of Canada, to prepare properly
for that country's development, which has been
pushed forward by Canadian-United States activities in the war against Japan; and that this survey
be made jointly by the federal Government, the
provincial Governments concerned, and the two
great railway companies.

I believe that surveys of this kind are about
to be made; and if these joint committees
suggested by the honourable senator from
Shelburne (Hon. Mr. Robertson) are set up,
they could review the reports and recommend
that the surveys be carried out in line with
the objectives of the resolution we are now
discussing.
Incidentally, just so that honourable
senators will not think our committee did not
give consideration to the east, we made this
further recommendation:
We recommend further that a similar survey be
made of all the northern portions of Canada for the
reason that the making of a true national economy
demands the utilization of the resources of all our
northland.

Some years ago I had talks with various
people-two of them are United States
senators-about the affairs which I am now
discussing. One of them is Senator Neuberger,
who spent a great deal of time during the
last war in the northern parts of Alberta
and British Columbia and in the Yukon and
Alaska. He played a great part in bringing

about the development of the Alaska Highway and in carrying out the military operations of the United States in those areas.
The other senator is Senator Magnuson, who
for a long time has been interested in highway and railway development through
British Columbia and on to Alaska. Whether
a series of corridors or an access way or
a free commercial port of deep water is
needed to develop mineral and other resources in the Yukon and the northern parts
of Alberta and British Columbia, I know
that when the people of Alaska realize all
the conditions surrounding this work, they
will not object to this committee sitting down
and discussing the matter.
When I first met Senator Magnuson he
was very interested in having an Alaska
Highway running northward through central
British Columbia, starting at a point near
Terrace or Hazelton, B.C., and running into
Alaska.
There is a commission now working in
Washington-and I am bringing this up
because of what I have to say about the
Panhandle-called the Alaska International
Rail and Highway Commission. This commission is studying the need for new rail
and road links between Alaska and the
United States. I have here a press clipping
dated February 6, 1958, which discloses that,
on the preceding Tuesday the commission
asked Congress to bring the province of
Alberta within its scope of inquiry. I might
say that this American commission is studying the use of land and so forth in Canadian
territory, but with respect to a highway
running to Alaska.
No objection has ever been raised by
Canadians to this commission carrying out
its work. There have been several other
commissions making similar studies. Therefore, there should be no objection whatever
to the joint committees, as proposed by the
honourable senator from Shelburne, inquiring
into the matter of the Panhandle. In fact,
if a joint parliamentary-congressional committee decided, for instance, that there should
be corridors or a free commercial port which
could be reached by Canadian transportation,
the Americans would really have no objection, because they themselves are planning
now on the construction of a highway or
railway going over Canadian territory and
into Alaska and they are at present surveying Canadian territory for this purpose.
During the last war, and since that time, we
have permitted the Americans to set up air
bases in Canada under their control. When
we were building the Alaska Highway we
gave full control in connection with everything about the highway to the Americans.
They were running it and nobody objected to

SENATE

this. It was the proper procedure to follow.
We would not have donc so had we not been
certain of the good will of the American
people and of official America in Washington
towards our country. Now we are asking the
same sort of thing in connection with the
Panhandle.
I am not going to delay the Senate, but
I do want to make one suggestion. I see by
this press report that the Alberta Government was represented by one of its ministers,
Mr. Taylor, before this commission in Washington, and he suggested that Alberta be
considered in the survey as well as British
Columbia and the Yukon. I agree with the
suggestion that that commission should give
consideration to Alberta, for the commission
is the body which will have to determine
what is the proper route to follow. Personally, I think the British Columbia route would
be a better one, but the commission will have
to make the decision and it should give consideration to the Alberta portion of western
Canada.
As honourable senators know, during the
last war a joint commission composed of
members from Canada and the United States
was set up to study and make a survey of
northern British Columbia, northern Alberta
and the Yukon with respect to defence activities and the discovery of raw materials in
those areas. The purpose of the survey was
to determine what kind of production could
be brought about and the action to be taken
in connection with it. I am sure the honourable senator from Waterloo (Hon. Mr. Euler)
and his deskmate (Hon. Mr. Crerar) are more
familiar with this work than I am. At any
rate, this work was carried on, but after a
couple of years the United States had to
withdraw and the survey was carried on by
Canada alone.
Honourable senators, as a result of all these
surveys there is a general knowledge that
there could be rich development in the Yukon
and in the northern parts of British Columbia
and Alberta, and that this development could
be brought about and reach its maximum
under proper conditions. To reach that mark
properly it must have access in some form
or another across the Panhandle so that it
can lead to a seaport of some sort on the
Pacific Ocean. That is the general question
I should like to see given serious study by
this committee when it is set up.
I spoke earlier of the good will of the
people of Alaska towards us. Some years ago
I was one of several speakers at a convention
of the Pacific Northwest Trade Association,
whose representatives came from Alaska,
Washington, Oregon, Montana and Idaho and
from the Yukon, British Columbia and Alberta. They passed a resolution for favourable

trade relations, a resolution which at that
moment would not have received approval
from many persons in Washington. But the
convention, where the personnel consisted of
at least three Americans to one Canadian,
passed that resolution, going all out for certain action by Congress at Washington with
respect to trade. The people of Alaska took
part in the debate, and all were just as favourable toward the resolution as were our people
from British Columbia. If I recall correctly,
the first president of that international association was our colleague the honourable
senator from Vancouver (Hon. Mr. McKeen).
He may have been the second president, but
I think he was the first.
In closing, I wish to express appreciation
of the action of the honourable senator from
Shelburne in bringing this motion before us
for consideration. I hope-and I think it is
certain-that there will be unanimous consent
by the Senate. I further hope that the Commons will approve of the suggestion in the
same way, that the Government will take
action immediately, and that this joint committee will be set to work. What form it will
take-whether it will be divided into branches
or into specific committees as needed, is
something I do not know; but whatever form
the suggested committee takes, I urge that it
get to work as soon as possible. There will
be many problems for this committee to deal
with. Still, I hope that before too long it will
inquire into the question of the Panhandle,
and I feel certain that our side will deal with
this question in a friendly manner. I hope
that whatever result is reached, the general
good will toward us will not be impaired in
any way.
Hon. Calvert C. Pratt: Honourable senators,
I am sure we have all listened with a great
deal of interest to the speech of the honourable senator from Cariboo (Hon. Mr. Turgeon).
It has had the value of bringing to our
attention certain matters which would reveal
the practical benefits of such a movement as
is envisaged in the resolution now before the
Senate.
I think the honourable senator from Shelburne (Hon. Mr. Robertson) has donc a very
valuable public service in bringing before us
a motion to give the approval of this house
to the establishment of a joint parliamentary
committee between Canada and the United
States. The measure of sponsorship and leadership which the honourable senator has given
in the NATO Parliamentary Association and
other bodies has earned the gratitude and
satisfaction of us all. He pointed out very
effectively in his speech that Canada has
been backward in getting into some of the
top intergovernmental movements which have

JULY
been in operation. I hope the one now under
consideration with the United States will
materialize and operate in a very effective
manner.
It is particularly appropriate that this important measure is being considered now
while Canada is being honoured by a visit
from the President of the United States. The
cordial welcome he is getting here in Ottawa
is just a reflection of the welcome extended
to him throughout Canada from coast to
coast. The speech of the President at this
morning's assembly of members of both
houses was extremely valuable in defining
the relationships of our two countries. It
certainly gave encouragement in a practical
way for mutual advancement in many spheres
of common interest.
Success of international promotions in
whatever field of endeavour cannot, of course,
be judged entirely by achievements as expressed in resolutions, or indeed by agreements. They can only be adequately judged
in the sum total of the effect of closer associations and understandings and in the
development of increasing desires and efforts
to work together for the common good.
Doubts as to the future displays of energy
and perseverance in making them a success
should never be a deterrent to good promotions. The important thing is to bring the
measures before us, put them into full effect,
and then do everything to make them work.
The resolution brings before us the need
for closer understanding and co-operation
between the United States and Canada at
the level of their Congress and our Parliament. Nothing has become more obvious
than that in recent times. One can cite
instance after instance of annoying circumstances which have resulted in criticisms one
of the other, but actually that is not unnatural as between neighbours. If we were
not so close together in relationship these
annoying circumstances would not occur. One
thing we must watch, however, is to see that
ill will is not created and does not spread
on either side by lack of mutual understanding on the official level which can filter down
to the level of the public on both sides.
To my mind we are very lacking in
imagination and practice in the matter of
public relations with the United States. After
all, it is what the public know and how they
feel that governs legislation in democratic
countries. Last year I made in this house a
suggestion which I now repeat, that as a
beginning of organized effort to disseminate
useful information in the United States about
our country, in relationship with our Department of Trade and Commerce there should be
specially trained information officers attached
to all of the Canadian consulates in the

United States. There are numerous ways in
which competent officers could give leadership toward improving the practical aspects
of our relationship with the American people.
Among ourselves we are constantly hearing of dissatisfaction concerning matters of
American policy, but not until we travel in
the United States, as some of us have done
quite widely, do we learn of any dissatisfaction on the other side. We seem to be looking
in on each other from the outside too much
and not seeing enough of each other on the
inside looking out. I feel that if this resolution is brought into effect and there is an
active intergovernmental relationship right
at the top it should do a great deal to develop
a mutually beneficial policy betweeen our
two countries.
In the matter of national defence, history
has been in the making for a long time
revealing the inevitability of our two
countries acting together. In recent years this
bas fortunately spread to joint and active
effort in the promotion of peace. This unquestionably is a matter of greatest concern
to us now as it is to the whole world.
The changes that have come over the world
in very recent times make our working in
close harmony with the United States, and
definitely with a clearer understanding of
each other's problems, more urgent year by
year. These changes are creating a fast parting of the ways between the old times and the
new. We are ail accustomed to the constant
expression "How times are changing!" but
it is very difficult to realize the full
significance of the great changes that are
affecting humanity throughout the world.
Science in almost every field is changing the
human outlook and methods of living.
Science extended to methods of travel and
communications bas broken down geographical barriers. Political boundaries are
still there and are constantly changing in
their international significance. Industrialization is spreading fast throughout the world,
and international trading operations are shaping up so as to prevent the most highly
developed country from living in a tight
little pocket of its own, hedged in by high
tariff walls and indeed hedged in by
relatively high production costs. Unquestionably of the greatest benefit to Canada and the
United States will be a policy whereby our
trading relations will be drawn closer and
both countries geared to participate effectually in the great economic unions that are
being set up among nations.
The strongest of ail reasons for our two
countries working together, as I have said,
is to face up to the changes that are taking
place throughout the world and be able to
adapt ourselves to them. The greatest of

SENATE
these changes is of course the division of
the world at present into two major secWe
tions, communist and free countries.
shall have to consider without delay what
will happen to us and to the United States
when the nations of Europe create a cornmon market between themselves, in accordance with their present policy. They will
then have no restrictions on the movement
of goods, capital or labour within their united
countries.
At present, as we know, this is the policy
of six of the countries of Europe. There is
a still wider field which is indicated by
Great Britain, whereby a free trade area
would extend to even more countries. Under
such a policy, not only would they have no
trade barriers among thernselves but they
would have a common tariff against the
world. If that comes about, as it probably
will, it will create the largest single trading
area in the world set up as one unit.

of is that the cause of self-protection, and
indeed of national survival, is going to bring
about great changes in international relationships, both political and commercial, in
many parts of the world. We can see such
changes ce:ning right now. I would express
miv firm conviction that no matter what our
inclinations may be to favour one counlry
or another in our trade relations-whether
it be the United Kingdomr or any other nember of the commonwcalli-our trade relations with the United States must always
be closer than those with any other country.
We have in Canada our responsibilities to
help direct a mutual common policy. I once
heard a leading United States citizen express
the view that the political separation of his
country and Canada is a distinct asset to the
free world. Diversity and civilized competition improve a nation's internal economy, he
went on to say, and by being separated the
United States and Canada have been able to
reach a more balanced judgment about the
rest of the world than otherwise would have
been possible. With that I am sure we all
agree.

constantly advocated policy both in the United

tariffs, such as valuations placed by reason

more imaginary than real, create almost a

Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Prat: People become afraid to

attitudes of the interpreters of the customs
acts and countless amendments. Tariffs are a
matter of uncertain policy, for unquestionably
there are times when the overall policy is to
tighten up, and other times when it is the
reverse-to slacken up. This causes tremenda certain
ous irritation. I once heard
expression about our great undefended border,
which is commonly talked of as an example
to the world. That expression, which contains
a good deal of truth, was that it is a boundary
of "4.000 miles of irritation". I repeat, there
is a good deal of truth in that, particularly in
periods oif what I might term "anti-dumping
mania".
It is not ny intention to continue with a
discussion of points of difference, whether
originating on this side or the other. I do
feel, however, there is justification in this
debate for referring to certain of the issues
as I have done, whcthcr they originale on our
side of the border or on the other. The thing
of greatest encouragement, however, in this
matter is that we do have so much in common and that there is such well prepared
ground for closest co-operation in every field.
In a very interesting speech on this subject
last evening the honourable senior senator
from Ottawa (Hon. Mr. Lambert) referred to
sorne aspects of the common background of
Canadians and Americans. I recall having
read somewlhere that there are over one million persons of American birth residing in
Canada and over six million first and second
generation Canadians residing in the United
States. The Dominion Bureau of Statisties
recorded that in the period of 1841-1941:
Canada received by immigration from abroadthe greater number from the British Isles-6,699,000
persons.

During the sarne period the emigrants from
Canada to the United States numbered
6,421,000. From the point of view of integratien of population, there was probably no
such example anywhere else. A great common
similarity also is in the economic field, and by
reason of the fact that both countries are
probably the world's leading examples of high
productivity and high standards of living.

JULY 9, 1958
The biggest consideration of all, however,
is that we are close neighbours. Our economy
naturally interlocks and our international outlook is practically identical, although in
details of policy there are, of course, variations. We differ just as naturally as neighbours always differ, and the greatest care
must be taken that these lesser differences
do not become magnified into breaches.
One of the most high-sounding issues on
this side seems to be what is termed the
preponderance of American investment coming into this country. Where should it more
logically come from? In this connection I
entirely agree with the view expressed by
the President this morning in his address
to Parliament. When investment capital
comes in it builds up our utilities and promotes our industrial growth. It is doing what
the pound sterling did in earlier days over
this whole continent and is still doing in
quite a marked degree. There is no more
natural place for capital to come from than
the United States. It is development capital
-foreign before it reaches here, but after it
arrives it becomes local capital. As the
President pointed out, it is subject to local
laws and taxation just as soon as it gets into
use. We should welcome the billions wholeheartedly-the more the better. One thing
we can be sure of is that before a decision
is made to send it in there is always a
thorough appraisal of its usefulness in the
development of industry in Canada. That is
simply good business. It is also taken for
granted that it would be treated just as fairly
as is capital originating in Canada, and all I
can say is that it will be just too bad for this
country if a critical attitude develops which
will cause our neighbours to doubt our fair
treatment for the portion of their own earning power which they send over here. We
must not forget that with those invested
funds comes a large contribution of the
results of their industrial research, which is
of tremendous value and on which American
industry spends hundreds of millions of
dollars each year.
Such an occasion as this, with a motion
before us emphasizing the mutual benefits
to be derived by improving relations between
Canada and the United States, is particularly
appealing to members of Parliament representing the province of Newfoundland. Let
me say right here that I believe that in no
part of the commonwealth is there a warmer
feeling toward England and a greater respect
for the traditions on which the commonwealth
was built than in Newfoundland. Commonwealth ties and close American affiliations are
not a contradiction and I hope never will be.
By reason of the military bases, the people of
,our province have had in recent years a

very close relationship with Americans serving in, and on behalf of, the armed forces.
In 1941 the Commission of Government of
Newfoundland announced that, in conformity
with the policy of the United Kingdom, areas
of Newfoundland had been granted to the
Government of the United States for a period
of 99 years for the establishment of bases
for their armed forces. For many years past,
in fact for many generations, Newfoundland
fishermen had gone to the United States,
principally the New England area, to carry
on their occupation, sometimes seasonally and
quite frequently to reside there. As a result
quite a close connection was established between our peoples, but not, of course, to any
greater degree than with many parts of
Canada. It was, however, with the establishment of the American bases in Newfoundland
that an intimate relationship was established
which can be taken as an example among
any countries of the growth of good and
friendly understanding, one toward the other.
It is interesting to recall that during the
period when the base construction was being
planned the troops of the first military contingent to come to Newfoundland were drawn
from the oldest regiment of the United States
forces. This selection was made at the time,
so it was officially stated, to recognize the
status of Newfoundland as having been the
first colony of England. It was a thoughtful
gesture and assured a good start for the enterprise. Since the commencement of that establishment in Newfoundland the American
operations have extended to three large bases
employing not only many thousands of army
personnel but also several thousands of Newfoundland civilian workers. The economic
effect on Newfoundland bas been of tremendous value to our people. The good relationships that have developed came naturally
as between our peoples and not primarily
from official action. The dispatch of an aircraft to make a mercy flight, as it is termed,
to some place of isolation where urgent
medical treatment is required, bas become
commonplace.
The participation of these American neighbours, both individually and by organization,
in welfare work has been outstanding. I might
inject here just one illustration of their kindness. Last winter an almost unprecedented
ice condition upset the electrical services in
St. John's for a few days. Thousands of
homes immediately found themselves without
heat and means of cooking. The huge American establishment at Pepperell, near St.
John's, threw open its doors and received
many hundreds of little children, and looked
after them until electricity could be restored
to their homes. The orphanages and other

SENATE

charitable institutions in St. John's and elsewhere have had constant help, both individually and organized, from the American
personnel at the bases.
I feel it is due to those good neighbours
of ours to give this expression of appreciation

by our own Prime Minister and by the two
honourable Speakers of this Parliament.
Everyone recognizes, of course, that if the
proposed parliamentary committees are appointed, another contact will be created
between our two countries on government

level.

more certain that I was conveying the general
feeling of the people of my province than I
am now in making these remarks, and I end
this talk just on that note.

The few remarks I want to make have
regard to the many other contacts and close
associations that we have with our friends
across the border in our daily lives as Canadians. Although it is a fact that contacts on
government level and parliamentary level
between countries are important, the fact is
that the contacts and the associations between
the peoples of our two countries are closer
and greater in scope by far than are the
contacts between the peoples of any other
two countries in the world. I would just like
to put some of those contacts in closer perspective and refer to some of the spheres in
which the peoples of Canada and the United
States come together. Indeed, the honourable
senior senator from Ottawa (Hon. Mr. Lambert) last night referred to one of those
Canada-United States associations which I
have had something to do with in the past,
and which J want to say a word or two about
today. In this instance I refer to the Canadian Chamber of Commerce, to cite only one,
and the Canada-United States Committee of
that organization.
In regard to our relationships with the
United States I think everyone realizes, both
in this bouse and among the public generally,
that the amount of good will and friendship
and understanding between our countries is
really of enormous extent and that whatever
differences we do have are comparatively
small ones. They are very tiny when you
compare them with the tremendous area of
good will and friendship which does exist
between our countries. Sometimes it is suggested to me that there are more misunderstandings between our two countries today
than there were, for instance, one, two, or
three years ago. Sometimes it is said that
there is greater misunderstanding now because of the recent change of our Government. I just want to say that I do not believe
that is the case. These misunderstandings
have simply resulted from the facts of life,
mainly in the business community and in
business relationships between us. Indeed,
the differences are matters of moods. It has
been said, for instance, that there has been
a bit of a change of mood between Canada
and the United States and that we would like
to improve the existing mood.
I want to quote one paragraph from a most
thoughtful speech which was made by Mr.

Hon. Gunnar S. Thorvaldson: Honourable

senators, as a very junior member of this
house I have looked around from time to
time, and a conclusion I came to on the very
first day I was here was that when one
reaches the Senate one should be discreet
enough to look, learn and listen rather than
try to make too many speeches. I hope I
have reasonably followed that precept. Perhaps I might recall the story about a young
member of the British House of Commons
who asked the great Disraeli for some advice.
He said, "Do you think I should speak in
this debate?" Mr. Disraeli looked at him and
replied, "Well, if I were you I would rather
have the members wonder why I did not
speak in this debate than why I did.''
I promise you that I will be brief, but I
am very much afraid that when I have
finished my disjointed remarks you will wonder why I got up to speak on this matter at
all. However, I want to give one reason immediately. It is that I was most intrigued with
the splendid manner in which, I feel, this
matter was brought to the attention of the
house by the honourable senator from Shelburne (Hon. Mr. Robertson).
The proposal to establish a joint parliamentary committee between members of our
Parliament and members of the Congress of
the United States is not something entirely
new. It bas been thought of before and is
one of those gradual developments now coming
to fruition. I might say I was most interested
in the story the honourable senator from
Shelburne related about the Commonwealth
Parliamentary Association and its work, and
his contact with it and the NATO Parliamentary Association, with which he, like so many
other members of our Parliament, has been

associated.
So, honourable senators, even if I feel I
have nothing to add to this debate, I do want to
say just a f ew words. First of all, this is a most
appropriate occasion to speak on this subject,
namely an occasion such as today when we
had the honour of having in the House of
Commons the President of the United States
and the Secretary of State of that country,
and the privilege of listening to the wonderful speeches that were made by the President,

JULY 9, 1958
Livingston Merchant, United States Ambassador to Canada, to the Women's Canadian
Club of Hamilton, Ontario, on January 22
last. The speech was a very comprehensive
review of the differences existing between
Canada and the United States. In reading
the speech over a moment ago I found it very
similar in content to the speech delivered in
the other house this morning by the President
of the United States. Among other things,
Mr. Merchant said this:

It is different in Canada, where our Government is responsible to Parliament and consequently is a part of Parliament. That is
another reason I say there is a gap in our
relationships, because we have had no official
method of communicating directly with the
Congress of the United States.
Our relationships with our friends across
the border, of course, begin with our Ambassador and the diplomatic corps in Washington. The diplomatic corps deals only with

knows, there is considerable integration between the labour unions of Canada and those
of the United States, and they are one of
the means, like very many other contacts, that
help to create, first, a knowledge of each
other, then friendship and understanding.
I wish now to refer to an organization
which is well known here, namely, the Canadian Chamber of Commerce, and which calls
itself, and indeed is, the "Parliament of
Business" in Canada. Since the early thirties
there has been in existence a committee
known as the Canada-U.S. Committee of
the Canadian and United States Chambers
of Commerce. That committee consists of
some prominent and important businessmen,
indeed some of the most knowledgeable
businessmen, of Canada and the United States.
For more than 25 years the committee has met
alternately once a year in each of Canada
and the United States for the purpose of
discussing and dealing with business problems that occur from time to time between
the two countries. One of these meetings
was referred to last evening by the honourable senior senator from Ottawa (Hon. Mr.
Lambert). The work of that committee has
been, to my mind, very important in the
business relationships between Canada and
the United States over the years. In addition, the directors of the Canadian Chamber
of Commerce, a few years ago, started to
have joint meetings with the directors of
the Chamber of Commerce of the United
States, meeting in alternate years in the
United States, generally in Washington, and
somevhere in Canada. In 1955, when I was
president of the Canadian Chamber of Commerce, we met in the city of Washington.
Incidentally, I had an opportunity at that
time of meeting the President of the United
States in his office and having a brief talk
with him. The next year the same body met
in Canada. These things indicate the mass
of relationships between us and the country
on the south side of the 49th parallel. For
instance, the first official duty I had to perform as president was to go to New York to
give a mesage to a convention of La Chambre
de Commerce de la Province de Québec,
which held a meeting, having an attendance of 500 persons, in the city of New York.
On that occasion-I say this very quietly-I
did try to make a speech in French.
Honourable senators, those are some of
the numerous relationships we have across
the border in the business world which are
designed to create the maximum of friendship and good will between us.
Again, in the military field, we have, as
we know, very close relationships. These
can be said to begin with the momentous
meeting between the late Prime Minister of

Canada, Mr. King, and the late President
of the United States, Mr. Roosevelt, at
Ogdensburg in August 1940, and they include all the subsequent defence and military arrangements we have had jointly with
our friends to the south, since that day to
the present time.
We can recall that only a few days ago we
were concerned in this house with one of
these defensive arrangements, namely, in the
ratification of the NORAD agreement. During the debate on that agreement I wondered
why so many people seem to be concerned
about Canada's sovereignty. Well, honourable senators, I suppose ordinarily one
should be concerned about the sovereignty
of one's country, but one can hardly think
of the United States as a foreign country;
at least, I find it very difficult to do so, and
I can never bring myself to worry very
much about this problem of sovereignty
when I think of our relationships with the
United States.
The honourable senator from St. John's
West (Hon. Mr. Pratt) in his speech referred
to another point which I might mention
briefly, and indeed to my mind this is an
important point of contact that Canada has
with the United States. I wonder how many
of us realize that since about the year 1900
nearly as many people have left Canada,
that is, migrated from Canada to the United
States, as have immigrated to this country
from abroad.
The main reason that we have been
groving in population during the last ten
years at a greater rate than we did prior
to say 1940 is the fact that our people have
been staying here in Canada, that they have
not been migrating to the United States in
the same numbers as formerly. One of the
problems of this country in the past was
the fact that we were paying great sums of
money in an endeavour to attract people to
come here but unfortunately we were losing
too many of them across the border. But
in the result, the great numbers of Canadians who have become citizens of the United
States have now become creators of friendship and understanding between our two
countries.
By the same token, of course, it should
not be forgotten that there are areas in
Canada, indeed many in western Canada,
which were settled extensively by people
coming from the United States. The honourable senator from Churchill (Hon. Mr.
Crerar) will recall the considerable number
of farm folks who came from the States of
Iowa, South Dakota and North Dakota into
parts of Saskatchewan in the 1890's and
during the first decade of this century, as
well as other large numbers from Utah,

JULY 9, 1958
Montana and the states south of Alberta
into that province. Large communities of
our western country are inhabited by
American settlers.
And so, honourable senators, that is an
important part of our relationships with our
friends to the south.
Perhaps the greatest source of good will
results from the approximately 27 million
visits made each year in the last few years
by Canadians visiting across the border and
Americans coming to visit us in Canada. The
figure of 27 million, which has been published
by the Dominion Bureau of Statistics,
includes all the people moving across the
border. Some of them would be commuters,
but the point is that no two countries in the
world have the continuous migration of tourists back and forth across their borders as
have Canada and the United States. So,
when my honourable friend a moment ago
referred to the border being 4,000 miles of
irritation, I think by the same token you
might just as well say that it is 4,000 miles
of good will.
Thus. while friendly relationships between
Canada and the United States are maintained between our governmental bodies, we
also have this vast number of contacts and
associations in the various fields that I have
spoken about. Consequently, when I read
this statement made by Mr. Livingston
Merchant at the very beginning of the speech
that I referred to a moment ago, I thought
it was most significant. He said:
I arrived in Canada with certain convictions.
The first was that Canada is more important to
the United States than any other country in the
world.
Since I came here there has been no
alteration in that conviction. It has deepened.

Honourable senators, I think that despite
our relationships within the commonwealth
and other countries we must admit that if
we were asked the question, "What is the
most important country in the world to us?"
the facts would dictate the reply that it is
the United States of America.
I do not intend to detain you much longer,
honourable senators, but I just want to
refer to a conference that was held in New
York two or three years ago by a group of
eminent Canadians meeting with their
counterparts in the United States. The purpose of this conference was to discuss
Canada-United States relations, and this
group tried to answer this question: "Why
should Canada and the United States be
interested in each other?"
Briefly, their reply was in six parts.
It reads:
1. Each country is the other's best customer.
2. We are bound together by a joint interest in
national security and defence.

57075-4-19

3. There is a growing need in ail parts of the
United States for certain vital natural resources
available in quantity from Canada.

Indeed, one wonders what would happen
to the United States industrial machine if
something occurred to prevent the export
to them of the tremendous amount of raw
materials that they get from Canada. I
think it safe to say that such names as
Kitimat, Steep
Rock,
Ungava,
Leduc,
Bathurst, Chalk River, are names which now
and during the past few years have been
nearly as well known across the line as they
have been in Canada.
4. There is
language.

a common

background, a common

That, of course, is too obvious to require
comment; it is so very true. We of course
each live under democratic Governments.
Both of us believe in religious tolerance, in
justice and liberty.
5. It is extremely important that we keep alive
the tradition of good will that has for many years
existed between our two countries.

We are indeed good neighbours over the
back fence. If we can't get along together,
how can it be expected that any other two
countries in the world can get along?
6. We have a common interest as partners in a
free world.

Those, honourable senators, were the six
reasons given by this group as to why
these two countries should be interested in
each other.
So, in closing these remarks I wish only
to say that I heartily support the motion of
the honourable senator from Shelburne (Hon.
Mr. Robertson). Any action which tends to
reduce friction and misunderstanding between Canada and the United States is desirable and important.
Finally, the proposed parliamentary association, if cultivated and developed, and
not allowed to die or to fritter away, will
create yet another landmark in a wide area
of good will, friendship and understanding,
which prevails between these two great
nations of the North American continent.
Hon. A. K. Hugessen: Honourable senators,
we are very much indebted to the honourable
senator from Shelburne (Hon. Mr. Robertson) for having introduced this resolution,
not only on account of its subject-matter,
with which I am sure we are all In the
greatest sympathy, but also on account of
the extremely interesting and able speeches
which his resolution engendered yesterday
evening and again this afternoon.
The resolution refers to the establishment
of joint parliamentary committees. I am not
entirely sure that I altogether approve of the

SENATE

particular phrase, "joint parliamentary committees". I think the basic purport of the
resolution, and the sense in which I take
it, is that it is very desirable that there
should be continuous joint consultation
between the members of the United States
Congress and the members of this Parliament.
That consultation might of course, and very
likely would, take the form of committees,
but I think the basic principle which my
honourable friend had in mind in preparing
his resolution was to make provision for
continuous joint consultation. In that connection I fully agree with what my honourable leader (Hon. Mr. Macdonald) said
yesterday evening. In effect, be said, it is
not the form of these organizations which
is really important, as much as is the fact
that we get the two groups into personal
contact with one another, whether by means
of a committee or otherwise; that is the basic
essential for understanding between men and
between nations. We need this form of
continuous joint consultation.
One instance of the sort of thing we need
was so beautifully exemplified this morning
in the visit which we had from the President
of the United States and the remarkable
address be delivered to us. But it is four
years since his last visit to Ottawa, and four
years is too long an interval between these
contacts.
I always bear in mind the rather striking
phrase that Sir Winston Churchill used some
years ago when be said that in our affairs
between the United States, Canada and Great
Britain, we were inevitably bound to get
mixed up together in quite a substantial
degree. That of course is eminently true,
and it is perhaps even more true as between
Canada and the United States than between
any other countries in the world.
I was most interested in what the honourable senator from Winnipeg South (Hon.
Mr. Thorvaldson) had to say to us a few
minutes ago about the various fields in which
this intimate contact takes place between
our two countries and between the various
groups in our two countries. As he said,
there is of course continuous contact between
the executive branches of the two Governments. Each of us bas an ambassador in the
other country, and there are constant peregrinations between ministers and members
of the executive branch of Government.
Talking about ambassadors, perhaps honourable senators will recall that rather
caustic statement that was made, I think, at
the end of the 17th century by somebody in
England, who defined an ambassador as being
a man who is sent abroad to lie for bis
country. I am quite sure that that definition
does not apply to the Ambassador of Canada

in the United States or to the Ambassador of
the United States in Canada.
Well, there is this pretty continuous contact
between the executive branches of our two
Governments. As the honourable senator from
Winnipeg South pointed out, there is a great
deal of very profitable contact between elements of private business in the two countries,
resulting very largely from what has been
referred to as the enormous investment by
United States citizens in this country. There
is, of course, the most intimate contact on
the widest of scales between individuals in
our two countries. I do not believe there is
a person in this bouse who would not say
at once that some of his or ber best and
most intimate friends are citizens of the
United States.
But there is just this one area in which
there does not seem to be any sort of machinery for joint consultation and discussion, and
that is precisely the area that we are considering now-the area of discussion between
the Congress of the United States and the
Parliament of Canada. I think it is to this
gap that the honourable senator from Shelburne (Hon. Mr. Robertson) bas attempted
to address himself. I was very much struck
with the statement made in this debate
yesterday evening by the honourable senior
senator from Ottawa (Hon. Mr. Lambert)
when be told us of the attempts he made in
1943 to bring about a meeting between
members of the Congress of the United States
and members of the Canadian Parliament in
connection with some particular question
which was then of mutual interest to both
countries, and how for some reason it was
impossible to bring about that meeting,
although there was the greatest of good will
on both sides, and how the matter lapsed
and could never be followed up. That sort
of thing is apt to happen where isolated
problems of that kind may interest individual
members of both bouses but where, despite
the best of good will, the members, being
busy men, are unable to follow up the contacts and see that something active is
achieved.
This brings me to the consideration of
how this desirable interparliamentary consultation between the Congress and this Parliament should be brought about. I feel it is
essential there should be some form of permanent organization charged with the duty
of arranging contacts between the members
of the two legislative bodies, arranging for
visits back and forth between them, and
keeping the members of each body informed
of the activities of the other.
We have a precedent for this sort of thing
-it has been mentioned in this debate-the

JULY 9, 1958

precedent of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association, which exists precisely
for the purpose of maintaining these contacts
between members of the various Parliaments of the commonwealth. It is a modest
organization and operates on a modest
budget, but its great advantage is that it
is a permanent organization and has one or
two officials whose sole duty and responsibility is to see to the maintenance of these
contacts.
I do not need to tell the house that it
was under the auspices of the Commonwealth
Parliamentary Association that the meeting
of the Parliaments of the commonwealth
was held last winter in New Delhi, to which
the honourable Leader of the Government
(Hon. Mr. Aseltine) was a delegate, and about
which he gave us such a fascinatingiy interesting account in his speech yesterday
evening. He emphasized in his remarks the
opportunities which be and his fellow
delegates from this country had to meet
delegates from other Parliaments of the
commonwealth and to discuss and consider
their problems. That is one of the essential
featurce of bringing people tugetiher and
creating mutual understanding, and that is
precisely what we want to achieve between
the Congress of the United States and the
Parliament of Canada.
If I may be permitted to diverge for a
moment or two in the same way that my
honourable friend the Leader of the Government diverged last evening, may I say I
had a minor experience along the same lines
as he did, when I was in London last April.
It happened that the Speaker of the House
of Commons and myself were invited by
the Secretary of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association, Sir Howard d'Egville,
to attend a gathering in Westminster Hall
of about 30 parliamentary delegates from
the parliaments of various parts of the commonwealth, comprising some of the more
recently constituted
parliaments.
These
people had gone to London to take a course
in parliamentary procedure which was being
conducted under the auspices of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association.
The Speaker of our House of Commons
and I found the experience a most fascinating
one. The gathering included delegates from
the Parliaments of India, Pakistan, the West
Indies-Jamaica, Barbados and Trinidadand from the new state of Ghana. Like the
Speaker of the House of Commons and
myself, the Vice-Premier of New Zealand
attended in the capacity of a visitor. I
think it was assumed that neither the
Speaker of the House of Commons, the
Vice-Premier of New Zealand nor myself
needed as much training in parliamentary
57075-4-19

practice as did the members of the new parliaments, so we did not attend the actual
tutorial sessions. However, we did have an
opportunity of meeting the various members
in a social way at tea on the terrace of
the House of Commons. I had a most interesting discussion with a distinguished
gentleman who was Speaker of the Upper
House of one of the Indian states. It was
most interesting to me to hear him talk
about the relations between the Upper and
Lower Houses in that state, and he brought
up questions which struck a responsive
chord in my mind when he said how difficult it was for the Upper House sometimes
to deal with legislation at the end of the
session, when it came in a flood from the
Lower House. So it is quite obvious that
there are common problems in various parliaments of the world.
Honourable senators, that is merely a
diversion to indicate the sort of work that the
Commonwealth Parliamentary Association
does, and perhaps as a footnote to what my
honourable friend the Leader of the Government said yesterday evening.
Now, I think that it is all very weil for us
to adopt this resolution introduced by the
honourable senator from Shelburne. I am
sure that it will be adopted unanimously and
with a great deal of enthusiasm by the
Senate. But I do want to point out that I
think we should go further than that, that
when this resolution has been adopted some
machinery should be set up, perhaps by the
Governments of the two countries concerned,
with modest parliamentary grants, for the
purpose of forming a permanent organization
in order to carry into effect the meaning and
the itent and the purport of what we hope
to
accomplish when we adopt this resolution.
So I conclude with the hope that this resolution will not only be adopted unanimously,
but that it will be followed by practical
measures to bring into being the sort
of
machinery that is needed in order to
ensure
that there shall be the opportunity for continuous consultation between the members
the Congress of the United States and of
members of the Parliament of Canada. the
Hon. Arthur W. Roebuck: Honourable
senators, I have prepared no great address
in connection with this matter, because it
seems to me that advocacy of the passing of
this resolution is no longer necessary after all
the powerful and eloquent speeches that we
have heard on the question; but I have had
some personal experiences which I would
like to lay before the house for the first
time.
Of course, I am intensely interested in
the subject-matter of the resolution itself.

SENATE

It has been the principle of the Liberal
party, and of course some others, but I think
especially of the Liberals, to foster good relations between ourselves and the United States.
The honourable Leader of the Opposition
(Hon. Mr. Macdonald) in his excellent address
referred to a number of arrangements that
had been made between our two countries.
I was in the Commons in 1940 when Mr. King
and Mr. Roosevelt made their historic agreement, with very little legal authority on the
part of either of them, but with the practical
knowledge of the necessities of the occasion.
I refer to the Ogdensburg agreement. It was a
generous agreement on the part of the United
States, and it enabled Canada to carry out her
part in the Great War in which we were
then engaged, without serious financial difficulty-something which could not have been
done had Mr. King not conceived the idea,
Mr. Roosevelt agreed to it, and both nations
endorsed it. We acted as real partners in the
war from then until its conclusion.
My mind goes back much further than the
Ogdensburg agreement. I remember a trip
that I took with Sir Wilfrid Laurier, on his
first journey over the Transcontinental Railway, which came into being because of his
initiative and which I think should be named
after him. That was a year or so after the
election of 1911. At that time I referred with
regret to the decision made by the Canadian
people-not so much the defeat of the Government, but rather the repudiation of the
reciprocity proposal, and I remember Sir
Wilfrid replying with the wonderful eloquence that always characterized him in
private conversation and public speeches. He
looked dramatic; he had the most kindly of
attitudes and expressions. On that occasion
he drew himself up and said:
Why, young man, a commercial warfare between
these two great nations is antagonistic to common
sense.
I treasure that sentence in my memory, and
always will.

As a matter of fact, while we have had a
border of 4,000 miles in length-my friend
from St. John's West (Hon. Mr. Pratt) said
4,000 miles of irritation-for all these years,
we have been able to get along very nicely.
There had been no talk heard publicly of
general diagreement between our two nations,
such as we have heard recently, until the
subject was made a topic of a debate in the
course of a political campaign. That is the
only reason that we are talking about it
today-a proposal to take from the United
States 15 per cent of our trade and give
it to somebody else. It was unfriendly, and
it is the basis of the present feeling of

uncertainty-the deterioration, as some newspapers of the United States have said, of
the relations between our countries. As a
matter of fact, the deterioration has been
violently over-stated. Relations between ourselves and the United States are very good
and I think will remain so. Indeed, I am sure
they will, since I listened to that most inspiring address delivered this morning by the
President of the United States in the Parliament of Canada, an address most hopeful
for our future relations.
That, of course, honourable senators, is
general comment that anyone might have
made. But I want to say something about the
subject-matter that has been dealt with by
three of the previous speakers, that is to say,
the part which the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association has played and will play
in the international relations between ourselves and other countries, including the
United States.
After 1945 I was in the Senate when the
honourable member from Brantford (Hon. Mr.
Macdonald) was the Speaker of the House of
Commons. In those days the parliamentary
association was very active, and remained so
as a result of his patronage, assistance and
encouragement. Somewhere about 1947 I became impressed with the non-democratic
character of that organization at that time.
It had never been really organized, it had
just developed-like Topsy, it just grew. It
grew because of the activity of Sir Howard
d'Egville, who commenced bis services in
that regard at the Coronation proceedings
after the death of Queen Victoria. From that
time he devoted his entire life to the promotion of the organization and the purposes
which it serves, but he did it as a member of
the United Kingdom branch. That is to say,
the United Kingdom organized what was at
that time the British Empire Parliamentary
Association, and Sir Howard formed similar
organizations in various parts of the commonwealth, such as Canada, Australia, New Zealand and elsewhere. But the inspiration and
control was all in England, at Westminster.
The British Parliament paid practically all the
cost, except our little local expenses, and the
secretary of the United Kingdom Branch
managed the whole organization. Sir Howard
was general secretary and he was everything,
almost. We contributed next to nothing and
we had very little voice in the management.
So I moved a resolution in the Canadian
branch deploring the organization as it stood
and advocating a general organization in
which all parties would be equal in status
and bear an equal or fair share of the costs.
That was carried by the Canadian delegation,
and in consequence I re-moved that resolution
at the convention in London in 1948, which

JULY 9, 1958
I attended as a delegate from Canada. It
was a wonderful gathering, just after the war,
of delegates from all over the commonwealth.
Parliaments which had taken part in the
struggles of the war had come through, as
you know, with a very great deal of credit
and we were royally received by the British
and entertained to the very extent of their
ability. They were short of food at that time,
yet when we travelled from place to place,
welcomed by the mayors and heads of state
of the various parts of that great kingdom, we
were dined on chicken, chicken, chicken.
And they had very few chickens. I remember
some good lady speaking to Mr. Fauteux, at
that time Speaker of the House of Commons
and later Lieutenant-Governor of the province
of Quebec, and saying to him. "Don't think
we dine as sumptuously as you do, not at
all; we have not had an egg in the last
two weeks". "Well, no wonder," said Mr.
Fauteux, "we have eaten all your chickens".
They did treat us wonderfully well, and my
resolution that we organize in a general way
was carried and enthusiastically supported
by the United Kingdom delegation.
One of the difficult problems that we dealt
with was the name of the organization. We
were agreed on changing it from the British
Empire Parliamentary Association to Commonwealth Parliamentary Association, but we
were not agreed on whether we should drop
the word "British" as the first word in the
name. I think it spoke well for the common
sense and generosity of the delegates of Canada, Australia, New Zealand and the United
Kingdom that we gave way and did not
insist upon calling it the British Commonwealth Parliamentary Association because,
had we done so, India could not have joined.
And perhaps not only India, for we also had
trouble in Ceylon and in Pakistan and to some
extent in the Gold Coast, in Liberia and
other places. It was much easier to have a
general association if we avoided the word
"British", and we did. And so it is the
Commonwealth Parliamentary Association.
The resolution was carried by that great
convention in London.
May I pause here for a moment to say
that we travelled over England and we saw
a very great deal of the difficulties the British
people faced at that time, the progress that
they had made and the greatness of the
nation. We also went to Germany. I entered
Berlin in 1948 on the airlift, and I looked
down on Unter den Linden, for instance,
and marvelled at the terrible ruin of that
once-magnificent thoroughfare. Berlin was
a sad sight, as were all the other German
cities that we visited. But it was a very
educative trip indeed and I have watched the
progress of the German people from that

time on with interesi and a knowledge
that I could not have had but for that experience. For instance, let me say something along the lines of a pet subject of mine.
During the First World War taxes were
very high, of course, in Germany. Many of
the landowners were unable to carry the
burden of taxation upon their property and
vast tracts of land went into municipal control. They were forfeited to the municipalities for non-payment of taxes, and the
municipalities had the good sense not to put
them up for sale at some miserable price and
let them pass again into private control.
When I was there, just shortly after the close
of the war, I was delighted to see many a
German man and his wife, and sometimes
his children, with a cart loaded with agricultural tools going along the autobahn
toward some little plot that they had secured
from the municipality and upon which they
were growing a magnificent crop of vegetables. Acres and acres of land were made
available in that way, on which the factory
worker after his day at the lathe, or whatever it was, went into the country and grew
food for himself and his family. The worker
thus was given access to mother earth, and
vast quantities of food resulted. That is one
of the explanations of the progress made by
Germany in the intervening years.
Well, that meeting of 1948 was a very fine
one, and in the following year the executive
that was appointed in 1948 in England met
in Canada in this building. I had the honour
to be the chairman of that gathering and,
under direction of the general association,
we drafted with the greatest of care a constitution that we thought would last. It has
lasted to date, and probably will for many a
day in the future. Of course, there were
difficulties. For instance, we could not base
contributions toward the cost of the association on the population of the member countries, because in that case India would bear
an unfairly large share of association costs.
Other countries also would be unfairly
treated. Because we were together in conference as friends and working in harmony
we were able to produce a schedule of contributions and have everyone accept it.
At the meeting of the association representatives in this very building, in 1950, we
agreed that in some manner we should bring
the United States into our deliberations. In
order to accomplish this purpose Sir Howard
d'Egville arranged for the whole executive
te go to Washington. We were received by
the President of the United States, then
President Truman, and I had the honour and
pleasure of introducing the delegates from
these various countries to him. He was most
sympathetic and, I thought, remarkably well

HOUSE OF COMMONS

CHAMBER,

OTTAWA,

on
Wednesday, July 9, 1958, at 10.00 a.m.
Mr. Eisenhower was welcomed by the Right Honourable J. G. Diefenbaker, Prime
Minister of Canada,and thanked by the HonourableMark Robert Drouin, Speaker
of the Senate, and the Honourable Roland Michener, Speaker of the House of
Commons.
Right

Hon.

J.

G.

Diefenbaker

(Prime

Minister of Canada): Mr. President, Mr.
Speaker of the Senate, Mr. Speaker of the
House of Commons, members of the Parliament of Canada, President Eisenhower comes
to us as the renowned leader of a mighty
state, but what is more meaningful today is
the fact that he comes to us as a good neighbour and friend. We are happy that he is
accompanied by his gracious wife and helpmate, for Canadians are very fond of her, too.
(Translation):
I now wish to add a word of welcome in
the French language, and to assure you, Mr.
President, that the warmth of Canadian feeling toward you and our great neighbour is
one that comes from the heart.
To you and to your gracious wife I extend
the most cordial welcome.
(Text):
In visiting us unaccompanied by pomp
and circumstance the President is following
an old and precious precedent in the relations of our two nations.
Although you come to us, sir, as the head
of a powerful state, the intelligence service
informs me after diligent inquiry that you
come bearing no arms and carry no armour
other than a brassie and a putter. May I,
sir, as an aside, express the wish that under
clear skies and on fairways not too narrow
you will be able, while here, to use this
armour and add to your list of victories.
The communist world is waging an intensive economic global offensive of "aid and
trade", an offensive which is not designed
to secure profits in a bookkeeping sense in

order to secure the ordinary values of trade
for its peoples, but an offensive whose success will be measured by the degree to
which the souls and hearts and the freedoms
and aspirations of the recipients will be subverted under communist tyranny.
I think this is a very great occasion. We
say what we have said on occasions in the
past, our countries are united in defence. I
believe, sir, that the Soviet challenge demands
that we can be no less in economic objectives. I believe that each of our nations,
and each of the nations of the free world,
in forming economic policies, while at all
times looking primarily to the welfare of the
individual nations, must as never before take
into account, in the common interests and for
survival itself. the effects of such policies on
the economic welfare and interests of all
other frec nations. And I go even further
and suggest that, to meet the ever-enlarging
expansion of communist economic cold war,
joint action is imperative to the end that
world trade will be expanded and the financial base of liquid resources necessary for
such expansion will be materially increased.
I feel sure I speak for all Canadians when
I say that Canada stands prepared to assume
her full share and to make her full contribution to such a bold policy.
Mr. President, our two lands have a glory
of their own, the glory of two peoples moving forward together, not complacently, but
with a humble pride, and joined in fraternal
association that has extended through a
century of tragedy and storm in different
parts of the world.
We can on this occasion, in the simplicity
of our faith, thank God that our nations

JULY 9, 1958

know nothing of ancestral hatreds or animosities. Above all, we may hope that this
spirit of peaceful and co-operative relations
will in due course become the fortune of all
mankind.
Sir, as you came into our city you drove
by and crossed over a small canal. Few
know today when or why it was built. It
was built more than 100 years ago to help
protect this country from yours. Today it
is a museum piece; it represents a past that
is past.
I would recall to you, sir, on this the
occasion of your visit to our country, one of
the earliest visits by Canadian parliamentarians to Washington. When Abraham Lincoln went to Gettysburg to deliver his
immortal and timeless address, one of those
who accompanied him as his guest on the
Gettysburg platform was the Honourable
William McDougall, one of the Fathers of
the Canadian Confederation. Mr. McDougall
had been in Washington with Mr. Galt on a
small matter regarding trade, and Mr. Lincoln, with that informality which has continued since to characterize our relations,
invited Mr. McDougall to accompany him.
It is of interest, too, sir, that when the next
day Mr. McDougall wrote to his family in
Canada his opinion, so different from many
opinions uttered that day, was that the President's words would live in history.
In the years since there have been many
comings and goings; there have been meetings,
and not all brought satisfaction to both sides;
but there has remained that glory to which
I referred a moment ago, that we can discuss,
that we have discussed, and that we shall in
the days ahead continue to discuss our problems and our differences with the candour of
free men in friendship, understanding and
manly frankness. I have often been asked by
other nationals what is the secret of the
dedication of these two nations to neighbourliness and mutual respect. The answer, we
know, is this. We trust each other in a union
of hearts based on common ideals and the
abiding principles of freedom and the rights
of men. Our peoples are North Americans.
We are the children of our geography, products of the same hopes, faith and dreams,
products as well of those forms of expression
which have been nurtured and enriched in
the traditions and common heritage of Magna
Carta, the Bill of Rights and habeas corpus.
When, thirteen years ago, you were given
the freedom of the city of London, another
great warrior-statesman, Sir Winston Churchill, said of you that you had shown "the
capacity for making great nations march together more truly united than they have been
before". I take leave to quote your noble
reply, in which in part you said:
57075-4-20

Humility must always be the portion of any man
who receives the acclaim earned in the blood of
his followers and the sacrifices of his friends.

Mr. President, it is in your clear knowledge
that it is only by -constructive deeds of living
men that the sacrifices of the dead can have
their proper values that Parliament, yes, the
Canadian people as a whole, give you their
warmest welcome and acclaim. I salute you,
sir, as the wartime commander under whose
leadership the legions of freedom marched
when liberty was under siege and no man
knew where salvation lay. I greet you, sir,
as one whose wisdom, humanitarianism and
prestige are once more humanity's major hope
for freedom and for peace.
Members of the Parliament of Canada, I
have the high privilege of presenting to you
a great and good tribune of freedom in war
and in peace, the President of the United
States.
Mr. Dwight D. Eisenhower (President of the
United States of America: Mr. Speaker of
the Senate, Mr. Speaker of the House of
Commons, Mr. Prime Minister, members of
the Canadian Houses of Parliament, distinguished guests and friends: As I begin, may
I be permitted to speak a few words in
my halting French to my French friends in
Canada. The Prime Minister did this with
great courage. I assure you I do it in abject
fear.
(Translation):
Here, in Canada, you have demonstrated
that differences in speech and manners of
expression need not impair communications
among a free people. So it must be among
all nations of the free world. Though we
may speak in different tongues and accents,
that fact does not weaken our determination
to work for a just and lasting peace. All
of Canada has a great and rich tradition in
the service of this high purpose. Her dedication to it has been staunch and persevering. Her example encourages free men
everywhere.
(Text):
Mr. Prime Minister, I want you to know
of my deep personal appreciation of the
warmth of the welcome you have extended
to me and of the generosity of the remarks
you have just delivered concerning me. Along
that same line, I should like to express my
very great appreciation of the warmth of
the welcome that Mrs. Eisenhower and myself have experienced throughout the city,
along its streets and in every meeting in
which we have had a part. We are truly
grateful.
This is my fourth visit to your beautiful
capital. I recall so well that when your

SENATE
gracious Queen came to Washington from
Ottawa we spoke together of the beauty of
this city and of the greatness of Canada.
It is good to return, to see old friends and
to make new ones.
I came here first in 1946 to congratulate the
Canadian people on the brilliant role played
by the Canadian forces you placed under
my command in the world war which had
then recently ended in victory. My next
visit was made as Commander of NATO
forces in Europe. In 1953 I returned as
President and talked in this house of some
aspects of the relationship between our two
countries.
I then spoke of the St. Lawrence Seaway
in prospective terms. Today it is near completion and next year it will be opened. This
is truly a great joint accomplishment. It wili
open up important regions of both Canada
and the United States to ocean traffic. It will
ever stand as a monument to what can be
achieved by the common effort of two
sovereign nations.
On that same occasion I spoke of the need
to devise ways to protect our North America
from any surprise attack. Since then we have
made great strides. The distant early warning or DEW line has been built and placed
in operation. In the process of its construction I am sure much has been learned which
will contribute to the more rapid development of the northern reaches of Canada and
our new state, Alaska.
Last month an agreement was concluded
between our two Governments to establish a
combined air defence headquarters for this
continent. We have also, both of us, striven,
as we will continue to strive, for the Soviet
Union's agreement to a system of inspection
to protect against surprise attack through the
Arctic. Recent Soviet communications have
strengthened the hope that they will come to
see that by such a system any basis for their
professed fears of an attack across the pole
will be removed. For Canada and the United
States such a system in operation would add
measurably to our security against a sudden
attack. Possibly it might also pave the way
for still further measures of arms control and
permit some reduction of the burden and
danger of modern armaments.
Both of these developments, the Seaway, a
broadened, deepened road for peaceful commerce, and the strengthening of our common
defence of this continent, strikingly illustrate
two things.
The first is that change is the law of life
and of relations between nations. When two
great peoples such as ours, energetic and
optimiistic, live side by side in all the diver-

sity that freedom offers, change is rapid
and brings in its wake problems, sometimes
frictions.
The second lesson that I see in these common achievements in diverse fields is that by
mutual respect, understanding and with good
will we can find acceptable solutions to any
problems which exist or may arise between
us. It is important to remember this. Such
differences as are from time to time expressed
never affect the similarity of purpose which
binds our two countries together.
Of course, each of us possesses a distinctive
national character and history. You won
your independence by evolution, and the
United States by revolution.
Our forms of government-though both
cast in the democratie pattern-are greatly
different. Indeed, sometimes it appears that
many of our misunderstandings spring from
an imperfect knowledge on the part of both
of us of the dissimilarities in our forms of
government.
And yet, despite these dissimilarities in
form, our two governments are developing,
and are increasingly using effective ways to
consult and act together. This we do to
meet the problems that confront us in our
relations with each other, and in the relations of both with other nations of the
world.
We share the basic belief that only under
free institutions, with government the servant and not the master, can the individual
secure his life, his liberty, and the pursuit of
happiness. We are both determined to frame
and follow policies which safeguard the lives
and homes of our people, their peace of
mind, their material well-being and, above
all other things, their ideals. Truc to these
ideals both of our countries, for example,
are deternined that the great decisions of
peace and war will remain always under
civilian control.
Moreover, we both recognize a design of
aggressive communist imperialism which
threatens every free nation. Both of us
face a military threat and political attacks.
Our system of free enterprise is challenged
throughout the world by a state-directed,
state-controlled economic system.
Indeed,
this could well be the area in which the
competition will be most bitter and most
decisive between the free world and communist imperialism. We must never allow
ourselves to become so preoccupied with the
differences between our two nations that we
lose sight of the transcendent importance
of free world co-operation in the winning
of the global struggle.
Acting in accordance with our common
dedication, the two of us, with others, have

JULY 9, 1958
drawn together in collective security arrangements. The most notable of these is the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization in which
both Canada and the United States are equal
partners. We are both determined to maintain what George Washington described as
"a respectable military posture". We are
equally determined to maintain our institutions in good repair and to ensure that our
own economies function well.
Thus we seek not only to meet the expanding needs of our people but also to set an
example of free men's accomplishments which
will encourage and attract those less fortunate. Finally, we are agreed that we shall
never cease striving for a just and lasting
peace to be achieved by negotiation with those
who challenge us. We overlook no opportunity to settle the issues which divide the
world and under safeguarded conditions to
reduce the burden of armaments.
Now, against this background of similarity
in basic factors and policy, let me now point
to some of the matters which it seems to me
are troublesome between us. Among these are
the surplus wheat disposal policies of the
United States, the imbalance of our mutual
trade, certain aspects of United States private
investment in Canada, and Canadian fears of
a trend in the United States away from forward-looking policies in the field of trade.
I am sure you agree that we should talk
frankly to each other. Frankness, in good
spirit, is a measure of friendship. It should
be the practice, I believe, on both sides so to
speak, when either feels that important interests are adversely affected by actions contemplated or taken by the other. Happily,
these instances are rare. In mentioning today specific problems on which we do not see
eye to eye I am doing so, of course, as an
American, expressing an American viewpoint.
I can assure you that your Prime Minister, in
discussing these problems with my associates
and me, most loyally and eloquently expresses the viewpoint of Canada.
It is my conviction, in which I believe he
fully concurs, that for ail of our present problems and al of our future ones we will find
acceptable solutions. It will take understanding, common sense and a willingness to give
and take on both our parts. These qualities
we have always found in our dealings with
Canada. I hope that you have not found them
lacking in us.
First then, in some detail, I should like to
comment briefly on our surplus wheat disposal
policies. I think that no one can quarrel with
our purpose, though some of our methods may
seem unorthodox by traditional standards.
Simply stated, our wheat disposal program
has three aspects.

57075-4-201

In times of local famine or disaster we give
wheat away. We have also bartered it for
strategic materials. Finally, we sell wheat for
local currency to countries which cannot afford
to purchase it commercially. In these cases
our policy is to lend back to the government
in question most of the proceeds for local
economic development. Our intent is not to
damage normal commercial markets, and in
this I think we have been generally
successful.
I know that in the past there was criticism
of certain aspects of these programs and particularly of our barter arrangements. I believe
that the basis for these objections has been
largely removed. Increasingly close consultation between officials of our two Governments
has ironed out many misunderstandings respecting our surplus disposais. Your Government knows in detail what we are planning.
I assure you that it is our desire and intention to keep the doors of consultation fully
open. There must never be a final word
between friends.
In several respects, despite inconvenience
and even occasional damage in the past, Canada stands to benefit from our moving some
surplus agricultural commodities into consumption overseas. First and most evident of
ail, many hungry people around the world
have had food which they otherwise would
not have had. Secondly, had these products
remained in dead storage they would have
had a depressing influence on the world
market and world prices. Finally, the funds
which we have been enabled to make available
to recipient countries should in the long run
help to raise standards of living and create
enlarged markets for ail of us.
I come next to the question of the imbalance of trade between our two countries.
You buy more from the United States than
you sell to us and this fact is of concern
to many thoughtful Canadians. There are
a few basic points which should be noted in
this connection.
First of ail, the United States and Canada
are not state traders. Al the products of
industry manufactured in the United States
and sold to customers abroad are sold through
the enterprise of the private seller. These
articles come to you in Canada only because
of the desire of the individual Canadian
consumer to buy a particular piece of merchandise. The United States Government does
not place goods in Canada as part of a statedirected program.
This aspect of our trade with each other
is the natural consequence of two private
enterprise economies working side by side
and trading with each other.
Then, we should also remember that the
free world represents a multilateral trading

SENATE

community. To try to balance our books
once a month or once a year with every
nation with which we trade would stifle
rather than expand trade. I assume that Canada is as interested as we are in the expansion of world trade rather than in its
artificial redirection. Both our people want
to buy and sell in a climate of economic
vigour and expansion. An imbalance in trade
with one country, in such a climate, is usually
balanced or largely offset by the state of the
accounts with other trading nations.
This is the case with Canadian trade.
Your export deficit to the United States is
offset by export surpluses to other countries
and by the fiow of investments to Canada.
The promotion of healthy multilateral trade,
as opposed to artificial bilateral balancing,
is an important objective of the international
monetary fund and the general agreement
on tariffs and trade, to which both Canada
and the United States belong.
For a moment I want to address myself as
well to the other side of the trade equation,
namely your exports to the United States.
Here you can rightly say that, through quotas
and tariffs, our governments' policies can
either expand or restrict your opportunities
to sell to us. The same is of course true
of actions taken by your Government which
can affect the volume of our exports to
Canada.
Neither of our countries is a "free trader"
in the classifical economic sense. Each of
us feels a responsibility to provide some protection to particular sectors of our economies
which may be in distress or are for other
reasons deserving of governmental assistance.
We have taken some actions of this sort. So
bas Canada.
Oil imports into our country contribute a
case in point. We believe that to ensure
adequate supplies of oil in an emergency,
it is necessary that exploration to develop
oil reserves be carried forward with vigour.
This means a healthy oil industry for the
continent. A healthy domestic oil-producing
industry is vital to our national security.
We recognize that our security and yours
are inseparable. We have been keenly sensitive to that fact in considering the nature
of the voluntary restrictions on oil imports
that have been put into effect by oil conpanies in the United States, and have minimized their impact on your economy.
Our restrictive action with respect to oil
is not in any sense reflective of a change
in the fundamental trade policy of the United
States. Such actions must be viewed in perspective.
For example, since the so-called "escape
clause" was incorporated in our trade agreements legislation in 1951, there have come

from industry in the United States a number
of requests for the imposition of quotas or
higher tariffs. In about a dozen cases presidential approval for some relief bas been
granted. In only one of these cases was
Canada directly affected as an exporter. We
have always conscientiously sought to take
account of your interests as well as our own
in seeking the best remedy to these intricate
problems. I believe that a study of the record
will bear out the truth of this statement.
Next, the flow of investment funds from
the United States into Canada has led to
expressions of concern on your part. These
funds have been attracted to your country by
the business opportunities Canada has offered.
Though they may raise questions in specific
cases respecting control of an industry by
United States citizens, these industries are,
of course, subject to Canadian law. Moreover, these investments have helped you to
develop your resources and to expand your
industrial plant at a far faster rate than
would have been possible had you relied
wholly on your own savings. They have
thereby helped to provide employment, tax
revenues and other direct benefits. These
funds have also helped Canada to finance with
case its recent surplus of imports from the
United States, a fact that is testified to by
the premium of the Canadian dollar over the
United States dollar.
I am confident that if there are some defects in this investment process, ways will be
found to correct them because that is in the
interests of both our countries.
One final word on the foreign trade policy
of the United States. In 1934 the United
States took an historic decision to embark on
a positive policy of fostering trade with the
launching of the reciprocal trade agreements
program. This policy we continue to support
and to practise. The Government of the
United States, after a public searching of soul
at times of renewal of the Trade Agreements
Act, has consistently reaffirmed this policy.
Have no fear that the United States will
abandon a policy so well established. The
problems I have been discussing concern our
economic lives. Our points of economic contact are varied and numerous, as they of
necessity must be under our chosen system
of private enterprise.
Our Governments have a responsibility to
help to compose difficulties, but we must not
forget that thousands of individual citizens
of Canada and the United States must themselves find in their diversified activities the
answers to many of these problems.
Finally, there is no cause to be surprised
or disturbed to discover that occasionally differences arise between us. The distinguishing
character of the peoples of the free world

JULY 9, 1958
lies in the fact that differences between them
can develop, can be expressed and then
amicably resolved.
We in the United States have no more
desire than you have to seek in our relations
with other nations the silent, sullen unity
that elsewhere has been purchased or imposed. The hallmark of freedom is the right
to differ as well as the right to agree.
I have spoken to you today in the knowledge that through you I address a nation
strong in the tradition of freedom and vigilant
in its defence. You and we are alike convinced, by our history, our religious faith and
our common heritage of freedom, that economic well-being and political liberty both
depend upon the efforts of individuals and
on their willingness to accept the responsibilities of freedom. Today, I assure you once
more of the pride and gratification that we of
the United States feel in our long and friendly
association with you, our sturdy northern
neighbour.
We stand together at a pivotal point in
history. All that we Canadians and Americans, and those who went before us, have
built, all that we believe in, is challenged as
it has never been challenged before. The new
horizons of competition range from the polar
areas, and extend to the infinity of outer
space.
It is for us, all of us, to bring to the challenge a response worthy of ourselves and of
our two nations.
As we do, we shall know the satisfaction
of having built, in friendship, a safer and
ampler home here on the earth for this generation and those that shall come after us.
I thank you very much for your kind
attention.
(Translation):
Hon. Mark Robert Drouin (Speaker of the
Senate): Mr. President, it is indeed a privilege to welcome you, on behalf of the Canadian Senate, to a body so dedicated as we
are to justice, to freedom and to a belief in
Canada's future.
Your presence among us recalls those fine
hours when our two peoples made the sacrifices which had to be made if they were to
maintain those great ideals which are still,
today, as precious to them as they were then.
Your visit also focuses attention on the deep
feeling of friendship which binds our two
countries in these difficult times when it is
not easy to draw the dividing line between
peace and war.
Our two countries are, so to speak, family
relations. We freely refer to you as our
cousins to the south, and through the centuries a true family bond has developed
between our two peoples. True, we have

our occasional squabbles, we have our differences, we disagree; but it amounts to
nothing more than the mere family spats
such as are likely to occur in the best regulated families. But once we find ourselves
faced with a common danger, we are quick
to forget these growing pains and, closing
ranks, we join forces, and heartened by our
bonds of friendship, we confront the enemy;
and, with God's help, we have been known
to emerge the victors.
Mr. President, you come as the head of a
powerful democracy in which the peoples
of the free world have, to a large extent,
placed their rightful hopes. This privilege
is not without its heavy responsibilities.
While you must no doubt, on the one hand,
be the guardian of your national interests,
your guardianship, on the other hand, of the
whole of the free world impels you to have
a constant regard for the hopes and the
needs of the nations joined in alliance. Never
must these hopes and needs be confused,
still less brought into conflict; most vital of
all, they must be brought ever more closely
together and reconciled. This heavy task
can only be accomplished through the utmost
clarity, impartiality and strength. In you,
Mr. President, we find embodied ail these
qualities, and we beg of you to rest assured
of our confidence and understanding.
Yet, despite all the crushing burdens which
are your lot, you have accepted to spend a
few days in our midst. Undoubtedly you
have been struck by the many contrasts of
language, tradition and procedure as between
our two countries. Our political institutions
are not built up in the same way; our ties
with the nations are not all identical; our
individual interests do not necessarily call
for a like approach. But you must have
found, in Canada, a spirit indistinguishable
from that which inspires your own countrythat of a free people, vigorous and aware of
the paramount importance of moral values.
What we have, through the grace of God,
we mean to hold; but no longer can nations
do this alone. We feel comforted at the
thought that we have the United States as
our neighbour, and we are pleased to feel
the warmth that comes with the knowledge
that we stand together in face of the common danger.
Mr. President, please allow me to express
to you, as well as to your charming wife,
our hearty congratulations on the occasion
of your 42nd marriage anniversary; and to
wish both of you many more happy years
together. Your union is symbolic of the
bonds of sympathy and of brotherliness
which bless the relationship between our
two countries.

PRIVATE BILL
CANADIAN WOMEN'S PRESS CLUB-COMMITTEE
AMENDMENT CONCURRED IN

Hon. John J. Connolly (Ottawa West), Acting Chairman of the Standing Committee on
Miscellaneous Private Bills, presented the report of the committee on Bill S-8.
The report was read by the Clerk Assistant
as f ollows:
The Standing Committee on Miscellaneous Private
Bills, to whom was referred the Bill (S-8) intituled:
"An Act to incorporate Canadian Women's Press
Club", have in obedience to the order of reference
of July 3, 1958, examined the said bill and now
report the same with the following amendment:
Page 4: after clause 10, add the following as
clause 11:
"11. The head office of the association shall be
at the city of Ottawa, in the province of Ontario,
or at such other place as the association may
determine by by-law from time to time."

The Hon. the Acting Speaker: Honourable
senators, when shall this amendment be taken
into consideration?
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): With
leave, I move that the amendment be concurred in now.

Hon. John T. Haig: Honourable senators,
in committee this morning I objected to this
amendment being made to the bill but my
objection was overruled. The issue involved
is not a very difficult one and I am not going
to press my views on the amendment now,
but I want to record my opposition to it.
The amendment deals with the location of
the association's head office. For the past
54 years that this organization has been in
existence its head office has been at the place
where the president lived, so the location of
the head office changed whenever a new
president was chosen. The bill as originally
drawn and presented to this house for first
and second reading called for no departure
from that practice.
I am not sure what this amendment does
mean. It says that the association's head
office shall be at Ottawa or at such other
place as the association may determine by
by-law from time to time. Now, I do not
see how at its annual meeting the association
can say by by-law that the head office
will be at Saint John, Halifax, Toronto,
Winnipeg or any other place, unless notice
had been given to every member of the
organization that a by-law specifying the
place of the next head office of the association was to be submitted to that annual
meeting. Otherwise, it seems to me another
meeting would be required to determine the
place of the head office. I rather like the
idea of carrying on the old system, namely,
that the head office be at the place of residence of the president. The idea as expressed
in this amendment accords with a provision
that is made in corporation charters. When
a company is incorporated a clause is put in
the bill stating where its head office will be.
Other provisions that are not in this bill are
inserted in such a charter. That is all right
for corporations that the public have to deal
with, but this association is and has been for
all these years a private organization. I think
it is a mistake to put it on a business basis.
I feel sure that there will be trouble about
this
amendment
among the members,
because for the past 54 years they have been
used to having their head office wherever
the president lived. Also the practice has
been to hold the annual meeting in the city
where the president for the year concerned
lives. If this year the president lives in
Montreal, the head office is in Montreal.
When the president resided in Winnipeg the
head office was in that city. Thus in various
years the head office has been in Vancouver,
London, Kitchener, Hamilton, and so on. I
think that arrangement was better than the
one proposed by the amendment to this bill,
but the members of the committee did not
agree with me.

SENATE
Honourable senators, I am not asking that
the house vote on this question; I am merely
registering my opposition to the proposed
amendment, for the reasons I have given.
Hon. A. K. Hugessen: Honourable senators,
as I was the one responsible for the amendment I should perhaps say a few words in
explanation to the house, in view of what
the honourable senator from Winnipeg (Hon.
Mr. Haig) has said.
Incidentally, I may remark that this
amendment was quite willingly accepted by
the sponsors of the bill; there was no contest about it at all.
This is what happened: for 54 years this
association was an unincorporated body, and
as such it did not really matter where its
head office was; it could be changed around
from place to place. But now the sponsors
have come to Parliament and asked for a
bill giving them power to incorporate, to
hold property, invest money and do certain
other things. Under those circumstances it
was felt that this association, like every
other private and public corporation in
similar circumstances, should have some
place as a nominal head office where it can
sue and be sued, make corporate returns
and so forth. That is the whole purpose of
the proposed amendment.
With regard to the annual meeting of the
association, it is true the president changes
from year to year and that it is convenient
to hold the annual meeting in the city
where the then president lives. But there
is nothing to prevent the association from
providing in its by-laws that it may hold its
annual meeting elsewhere than at the head
office of the association. It can take place
wherever the president happens to live. I
assume that the association will continue to
do as it bas done in the past, hold its annual
meeting in the city where the then president
resides.
Motion agreed to.

Rigaud (Hon. Mr. Dupuis) asked the following question:

INQUIRY ANSWERED

Any senator conceiving himself offended, or injured in the Senate, in a committee room, or any
of the rooms belonging to the Senate, is to appeal
to the Senate for redress.

Is there any law which forbids a member of
Parliament from displaying a flag, not necessarily
of his own choice but one that might or might not
ever be chosen as the Canadian flag?

There appears to be no regulation covering the point in question. Therefore, my
reply to this question is that no person
can give a definite legal opinion on a matter
such as this. The honourable senator from
Rigaud, being a prominent and distinguished
practising lawyer in the city of Montreal,
will I feel sure, upon reflection, agree with
me.
Hon. Vincent Dupuis: Honourable senators,
with all due deference to the honourable
Leader of the Government (Hon. Mr. Aseltine), I would say his answer is just a little
different from what he said yesterday.

As

reported on page 279 of yesterday's Hansard
the honourable leader, in replying to my inquiry of a previous date, said:
I am unable to answer the honourable gentleman's question today, but I have a copy of an order
in council, passed in 1945, which I would like to
show my honourable friend, and let the question
stand unanswered for the present.

The leader has given a definite answer
today that there is no legal rule to be applied in a case like this. I am sure that
my honourable colleague will not tax me with

exaggeration or with being hard to satisfy.
I have some knowledge of the democratic
system in this country and I am familiar
with the principle that a man's home is his
castle. This applies to a member of Parliament, even in his office.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: That bas nothing to do
with the question I was asked. I was asked
if there was any law forbidding a member
of Parliament from displaying a flag, not
necessarily of his own choice but one that
might or might not ever be chosen as the
Canadian flag.
Hon. Mr. Dupuis: That is quite correct,
and I am glad that the honourable Leader

JULY 10, 1958
Honourable senators, I am sorry I find it
necessary to talk about myself but it is my
duty to do so on this occasion. May I say
that during my entire life whenever I have
been offended I have never reacted in a spirit
of revenge. I always felt that the person
who had wronged me had done so without
first pondering on his action, and I always
thought that if I insisted that the wrongdoer
be punished, his wife or children or mother
or father might be affected by it. I am
adopting the same attitude in this instance.
I do not care who removed the flag but I
do care about the principle involved in consequence of such removal, and the matter
of redress for the offence which has been
committed, and I would like to have a decision by this honourable body. When things
similar to this have occurred in the British
House of Lords, a member of that house has
been given leave to appeal to his peers for
comment or decision. Perhaps today is not
the proper time to appeal in this way to
this honourable house, but I would like to
submit the whole question to the house,
together with my reason and my motive for
doing what I did. I am sure honourable
colleagues will have the tolerance to listen
to me, and that when they do they will agree
with me that this question involves some
of the great principles which are inscribed
in the Magna Carta; and that it is of great
importance that these principles be preserved
for ever in this country, no matter in what
circumstances they may have been infringed,
even if it be in a trivial event like this one
which occurred-through my fault, I admit
-on July 1 of this year. So, with permission
of the Senate, I would like to obtain the
right to defend and thoroughly explain my
actions at the next sitting of the house or at
any time convenient to honourable senators.

He said in an interview that American and
Canadian delegations visiting Russia are "handpicked, well-briefed by their governments, politically
immature and naturally very biased".
Soviet delegations visiting North America were
"well-received, wined and dined, but they never
get the chance to meet the people they want to
meet, or to see the places they want to see".
"The West should be strong enough not to be
afraid to have comparisons made," he added.
American and Canadian delegations returning
home from Communist countries realized that if
they praised the Soviet system too enthusiastically
they ran the risk of being branded fellowtravellers.
Jung also said that, although he regards himself
as "Canadian first and Chinese second," ho could
"as a lawyer" see no legal reason for the Canadian
Government's refusal to recognize Communist China.
"I can see the moral responsibilities that we have
to the Formosan Chinese," he explained.
"But I would have thought it possible to make
Formosa a United Nations trusteeship for ten or
fifteen years and then to take a plebiscite on its
future."

The question I wish to ask as a result of
this is, does the honourable Leader of the
Government (Hon. Mr. Aseltine) know of
any Government policy whatever by which
delegates to Russia are hand-picked and
briefed to make some biased statement against
Russia in any way?
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: No, I know of no such
regulation or order. I think the question is
not one for this chamber at all; I think it is
a question which should be brought up in
the House of Commons. This man is not a
member of this house.

Hon. Mr. Farris: He is a representative of
the Canadian Government, is he not?
Hon. Mr. Reid: Sure; he is a member of
Parliament.

I presume, the head of this organization that

paid by the Dominion Government? And
just whom does he represent, and what right
has this Chinaman to make these statements
in Paris on behalf of the Canadian people?
Hon. Mr. Aselline: Surely the honourable
senator does not expect me to answer that
question. I have never seen the article at
all, and I do not know if it is correct or not.
If it is a question, let it be put on the Order

JULY 10, 1958
NARCOTIC DRUG TRAFFIC
OF SPECIAL
IMPLEMENTATION
PROPOSED
COMMITTEE'S RECOMMENDATIONS-DEBATE
CONCLUDED

The Senate resumed from Thursday, July 3,
the adjourned debate on the inquiry of Hon.
Mr. Reid calling the attention of the Senate to:
-prevalence of narcotic addiction in Canada and
the desirability of introducing legislation to implement the recommendations of the Special Committee of the Senate on the Traffie in Narcotic
Drugs in Canada, which reported to this house on
23rd June, 1955.

Hon. F. W. Gershaw: Honourable senators,
in 1955 a special committee of the Senate
inquired into the whole problem of drug
addiction in Canada. As the chairman, the
honourable member from New Westminster
(Hon. Mr. Reid), has stated, some very
eminent witnesses were examined, and their
suggestions should not be allowed to pass into
the limbo of forgotten things.
It was pointed out that the illicit use of
drugs has been common in almost every
country and in every age. Five thousand years
bef ore the birth of Christ opium was used by
Helen of Troy to bring on forgetfulness of
pain and evil. On down through the ages
Chinese peasants have used opium to assuage
and dull the pangs of hunger.
Now, the World Health Organization has
inquired into this problem and it has defined
narcotic addiction as a chronic intoxication
with the following characteristics: (1) A compelling and overpowering desire to continue
the use of the drug and to get it by any
means. (2) A tendency to increase the dose.
(3) A mental and sometimes a physical
dependence on the drug. In other words,
it becomes a way of life and it can only be
replaced by a different way of life-a change
that does not happen very often with a
narcotic addict.
Addiction as an avenue of escape from the
troubles and realities of life is a dangerous
thing. It leads to selfishness, poverty, misery
and crime, and the addict loses all respect
for honesty and ordinary morals. He thinks
little of his parents, his wife and children;
he thinks only of how he can get more drugs.
He neglects his person, his health and certainly all his social responsibilities.
In Canada, of course, an addict is not
regarded as a criminal unless he is found
in illegal possession of drugs. And so all
sorts of ingenious devices are contrived for
the purpose of hiding the drugs. Addicts
wrap the stuff in cellophane and if they are
searched by a policeman they swallow it;
they cut cavities in the heels of their shoes
and carry the drug there.
The question arises, why does anybody become addicted to drugs? Well, in the first
place, those who have easy access to a drug

often fall for it-doctors, nurses, chemists
and so on-and sometimes people who were
given an opiate for pain continue to use it
after the pain disappears. But the largest
group of users who cause trouble in this
country are those who get narcotics by illicit
means. They are sometimes normal people
who take a drug as an experiment or for
the thrill it gives them. Such persons are
probably classified often as being a little
below the normal average, or possibly they
have a weak personality. They may be
alcoholics or juvenile delinquents. Many of
them live in miserable tenements or taverns,
in broken homes or slums, where there is
no regularity of meals. Frequently they have
had no special training; they indulge in idleness, and they associate with criminals, some
of whom may be addicts.
The question arises, where do people who
traffic in drugs get them and why do they
engage in the traffic? The answer in part
at least is that the profit on the sale of
narcotics is very high. An ounce of heroin
is worth about $12 wholesale; when it is
divided up and put into quarter-grain capsules it sells at something like $5,000 to
$8,000. So the pusher makes a tremendous
profit on these drugs, and the poor victim
who needs four or five capsules a day has
to rustle up $25 every day in order to keep
his appetite satisfied and to escape the terrible pains of withdrawal. I shall not deal
at length with the pusher or the trafficker,
because he is seldom an addict. I shall
touch briefiy on the question of treatment
of addicts.
The initial step in combating drug traffic is
of course to prevent drugs from getting into
the country by vigorously enforcing the laws.
The R.C.M.P. have been working towards
this end for 20 or 30 years, but still
there are upwards of 3,000 addicts in
the country. Heroin is not manufactured in
this country and it is illegal to import it
for any cause whatsoever, yet it does come
in from secret factories in Europe and other
places. How to prevent its entry into the
country is a very difficult problem.
One means of treatment suggested to the
committee was the establishment of supply
centres, so-called clinics where the poor addict can come and get the supply he needs.
But the great majority of witnesses thought
that such treatment would be a failure. They
feared the addict would get his requirement
of drugs early in the day and spend the
rest of the day looking for more, because
the addiction is progressive.
Somebody else suggested that addicts should
be put in j ail. Well, some of them would like to
be put in jail. They are thin, anaemic, rundown individuals, poorly clothed and poorly

SENATE

fed. When they are sent to jail they have
to go through the terrible suffering that
results from being deprived of the drug, and
after that they usually gain weight. But
that is not very satisfactory treatment. They
become restless and perhaps resentful, and
long for the ecstasy of what they call a
"fix"; they long for the relief that it will
bring-the tranquility, the glow through their
system, and the very beautiful dreams and
visions which they experience. The result
is that when they get out of jail they go back
to their habits.
One girl who came before the committee
had been in jail for three months, yet two
hours after she left the jail she had had
a "fix". Another individual told us that he
had been six or eight years in jail and when
he got out he started to use opium again.
There is a mental craving that continues.
Somebody suggested that addicts be shipped to an island in the ocean and kept there.
Well, that would involve tremendous capital
cost. In the first place, we could never
round them all up, and even if we could the
result would be about the same as if we
put them in jail.
One doctor who had carried out a very
interesting experiment came before the committee. He had taken seven addicts, two
married women with their husbands and three
others, all well-to-do people, and by cooperation and hard work on the part of the
doctor over many months their consumption
was cut down from four to eight grains a day
to one-twentieth of a grain a day, and he
hoped that they would stay at that. But
along came a period of stress, some excitement, some worry, and one by one they
all gradually went back to taking large
quantities of the drug.
Then a Salvation Army officer appeared
before us and pointed out that their officers
had worked for 70 years along "Skid Row".
He told of how they had contacted the prison
population of the large cities and dealt with
the derelicts and dregs of society, and he
made the statement that there can be no
moral or social reformation without a new
moral life. He presented some case histories
that were most impressive. He pointed out
that sometimes magistrates and police officers
treat these people with a great deal of harshness, whereas the Salvation Army treats them
with firmness, kindness and friendship, with
some good results.
A distinguished jurist once said, "There
is no justice without humanity." We heard
the history of one unfortunate man named

habit, had taken treatments in the sanitarium, had been in jail at different times and
had been in and out of hospital, and at the

final stage was practically down and out.
He came to the Salvation Army for some
That was 15 years ago.
Divine help.
Charlie is now a prominent merchant in the
city of Chicago, and two years ago was
voted "The Man of the Year" in that city.
The Salvation Army people are very proud
of that particular case history.
The majority of the witnesses who appeared
before our committee pointed out that prevention of trafficking was the most important
factor in reducing addiction, but of course
it is very difficult to achieve. We are brought
back to the need for better homes-many
of the unfortunate addicts come from broken
homes-and the need for an improved economic condition for everyone.
Witnesses also stressed the necessity of
preventing drugs from coming into the
country, and of effectively dealing with
traffickers. They also pointed out that people with weak personalities, especially
school children, might be helped by being
given special care and instruction. Of
course, no one suggested instruction be given
in schools on the evils of the narcotic habit;
all seemed to consider that a dangerous
thing to do. However, it was felt that drug
addiction should be regarded as a disease to
be reported in the same way as typhoid,
tuberculosis and some other contagious
diseases; they suggested also that it come
under the Mental Health Act, so that treatment would be compulsory.
As a matter of fact, there is no magic
cure for drug addiction; there is no wonder
drug that can take away the awful craving
that an addict suffers. It was suggested that
the treatment practised at the centre in
Lexington, Kentucky, be tried out in Canada.
There the addict is kept in hospital for two
weeks until he gets over the withdrawal
symptoms, when he is given guarded care
for another eight months.
This treatment was not altogether satisfactory and it was felt that there should be
more follow-up care. It was suggested that
addicts should be taken in groups of 20 or
30 to a large rooming house or private hospital where they could be kept under the
care of rehabilitation officers; in that way
their health could be observed, and they
would have companionship and a fair measure of happiness. Above all, they would
have an occupation, which is most essential
to the helping of a drug addict who, so
This isolation
often, has no occupation.
treatment, it was felt, should be continued
as long as was necessary. From time to
time the capabilities of the inmates would
be assessed: some of them might be allowed
out, while others might expect to remain
there the rest of their lives.

JULY 10, 1958
One police officer, who had 26 years' police
experience, testified that he had never seen
a confirmed addict cured. Even at Lexington
the authorities feel they can effect a cure in
only about 13 per cent of those who come
for treatment.
But, regarding drug addiction as a disease,
it is entirely against medical practice and
teaching to give such an individual drugs or
allow him to obtain a given quantity of the
very substance that is bringing about his
ruin. That treatment would be a defeatist
attitude. That is not the attitude that has
created the great advances in medicine and
the treatment of human ills. Great advances
were made by study, research and thought;
and, although the way upward was often
steep and rugged, the summit has been
reached in many fields. The summit, I believe, can be reached with the treatment of
drug addiction. What a blessing it would be
if the 3,000 addicts in Canada had some available means of treatment which would hold
out some cure for them! Indeed, it would be
a great blessing to them, to their friends and
their relatives.
After listening to the evidence that was
produced before the committee, it seems clear
that the situation is serious enough to call
upon those in authority to persevere in finding a cure, to direct the deep reserves of
research into the operation and establishment
of some system which, in the light of the
knowledge we have at present, will hold out
some hope of cure for drug addicts.
Hon. W. Ross Macdonald: Honourable
senators, before this debate is concluded I
would like to repeat to some extent what I
said at the time the committee brought in
its report.
As honourable senators will remember, in
1955 the Senate set up this committee which
was referred to as the Special Committee
on the Traffic of Narcotic Drugs in Canada.
I recall that its members were so selfsacrificing that they gave up their Easter
recess in order to visit certain parts of Canada. They sat for some days in Vancouver
and heard witnesses there. As I say, that was
done at a time when the rest of us were
vacationing at our homes.
They made a thorough investigation of this
very difficult problem and brought in a report
that received most careful attention by both
the Department of Justice and the Department of Health and Welfare.
A few days ago we heard a very interesting
address on narcotic drugs by the honourable
senator from New Westminster (Hon. Mr.
Reid), who was chairman of the committee,
and today we have heard an equally inspiring speech by the honourable senator from
Medicine Hat (Hon. Mr. Gershaw). These

two senators are well informed on this subject. I am sure I speak for all honourable
senators when I express our appreciation to
all the members of that committee for the
fine service they have rendered in this connection to Canada.
As the senator from Medicine Hat has just
said, this is a problem which must be faced
and a solution must be found. I gathered from
the remarks of the senator from New Westminster that it is being proposed by certain
people that drug addicts be treated by way
of administration of drugs through clinics.
As I recall the report of the committee, it did
not recommend such treatnent. I am not
sure that such treatment should be recommended. My understanding is that the whole
question of the treatment of people who are
addicted to this habit is receiving the consideration of the department. Once again
thanking the committee for the splendid work
it rendered, I think I can safely say that no
change will be made without careful reconsideration of this whole report.
TRUST COMPANIES BILL
MOTION

FOR

SECOND READING-DEBATE
ADJOURNED

On the Order:
Second Reading of Bill S-11, intituied: "An Act
to amend the Trust Companies Act"-(Honourable
Senator Aseltine).

Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Honourable senators,
before we proceed with the second reading of
this bill I would point out that copies of it
were placed on the desks of honourable
senators only 10 minutes ago. I reserved part
of my morning for a study of Bills S-10 and
S-11, and when I looked for them on my desk
I could not find them. I had my secretary
search the office for them, and when she could
not find them an inquiry at the Distribution
Office disclosed they had not been printed.
I do not know what Bill S-11 contains, but
according to the Order Paper it received first
reading in this house Tuesday night. For some
reason it has taken almost 48 hours to have
copies printed and distributed to honourable
members. I am certainly not in a position to
discuss the measure now and if it is presented
for second reading today I propose to move
adjournment of the debate in order that I
may peruse the bill. I cannot agree to having
the bill receive second reading this afternoon.
Hon. Mr. Bruni: Honourable senators, I can
only say that no one in the Senate can be
held responsible for the operations of the
Queen's Printer. The bill was sent to the
Queen's Printer after it had been given first
reading on Tuesday evening, and it was only
a few minutes ago that the printing was completed and copies were distributed in this

SENATE
chamber. If any honourable senator can tell
me how to get bills printed more quickly than
they are being printed at present, I will certainly welcome such information.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I was not blaming
the honourable senator from Hanover (Hon.
Mr. Brunt). All I was suggesting was that
in a case like this he should not expect us
to give a bill second reading before we
have had an opportunity of reading it.
Hon. Mr. Bruni: I have no objection to the
honourable Leader of the Opposition (Hon.
Mr. Macdonald) moving adjournment of the
debate but I want this house to realize and
understand that it is no fault of the officials
of the Senate that copies of this bill reached
here only a few minutes ago.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Nobody suggested
that.
Hon. Mr. Bruni: Everything was done to
have this bill printed and distributed as
expeditiously as possible.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Honourable senators,
I want to say a word in support of what the
honourable Leader of the Opposition (Hon.
Mr. Macdonald) has said. I do not think
there is any criticism whatever with regard
to the printing of the bill and I fancy that
if we had the printers here they could explain their action in the matter. Nobody is
calling anybody into question in that regard,
but I do call into question the presentation
of this bill for second reading or discussion
at all today. There are on the Order Paper
a bill to amend the Trust Companies Act
and a bill to amend the Loan Companies Act.
Both are important and would have far-reaching effects. I have not been able to read them
of course, but you may remember that when
the bills were introduced I asked for a
short explanation.
The explanation then
given was helpful, but I should like to
have an opportunity to read the bills before
they are even discussed in this chamber.
I therefore suggest we do not proceed with
any further explanation of them until we reassemble at the beginning of next week.
Hon. Mr. Euler: May I ask a question?
Are the trust companies or the loan companies themselves the instigators of the
bills?
Hon. Mr. Bruni: They are the instigators
of two of the main amendments in the bill
before us, and when the Government decided
to proceed with these two amendments it
added to the bill three amendments that it
desired.
While I am on my feet may I say that I
should like to have an opportunity of making the Government's statement on the bill

today. Then the honourable leader opposite
(Hon. Mr. Macdonald) could move adjournment of the debate and honourable senators
would have ample opportunity to study the
bill and go over my remarks. I think honourable senators would then be better prepared
to discuss the bill on Tuesday night. If the
honourable leader opposite moves adjournment of the debate after I have made my
explanation, I do not see how any senator
could be critical of that procedure.
Hon. Mr. Howard: Honourable senators,
I do not want in any way to delay the bill
and I would like to hear the explanation that
is going to be given. However, representing
as I do not only a constituency but quite a
large district in Quebec, I would like time
to consult the trust companies in my bailiwick
and learn what they think about the bill.
Hon. Mr. Bruni: Does my honourable friend
realize that this bill applies only to 10 trust
companies that have been incorporated under
dominion legislation? It has no application
of any kind whatever to any trust company
incorporated under the laws of any province.
I think my honourable friend will find that
most of the trust companies operating in
Quebec are incorporated under provincial
laws and that this bill does not affect them
in any way.
Hon. Mr. Howard: That is not quite the
fact. There are several trust companies in
Quebec incorporated under dominion charter.
There are also several incorporated under
provincial charter and, because of a deal that
was put through some time ago, I can
appreciate that it is quite a different proposition whether a trust company is incorporated
under a provincial or under a federal charter.
Although I do not believe it would change
my argument, I would first like to make sure
the trust companies in my section of the
country are agreeable to this legislation.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: Would not the honourable gentleman from Wellington (Hon. Mr.
Howard) be in a better position to do what
he has suggested if he heard the explanation
of the bill today? He would then know what
the bill was about and he could discuss it
with officials of the trust companies in his
district. The bill does not have to be given
second reading this week or even next week.
Hon. Mr. Howard: That is exactly what I
said at the outset of my remarks, that I
would like to hear the honourable senator's
explanation before dealing with the bill.
Hon. Mr. Farris: Has the honourable senator from Hanover (Hon. Mr. Brunt) a reason
for wanting to explain the bill on second
reading today?

JULY 10, 1958
Hon. Mr. Bruni: I am here today and I am
prepared to make the explanation today.
Hon. Mr. Farris: That is no reason.
Hon. Mr. Bruni: Well, if that is no reason
then I haven't a reason.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Will the honourable
gentleman be here Tuesday night?
Hon. Mr. Bruni: At the present time I do
not know. In any event, we have to have
a motion for second reading if I am to proceed with an explanation. I therefore move
that the bill be read a second time now.
Honourable senators, Bill S-11 is an Act
to amend the Trust Companies Act. This
particular legislation applies to 10 trust companies in the Dominion of Canada which
have been incorporated under the dominion
statutes or under the authority of Parliament.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Could my friend give us
the names of the companies?
Hon. Mr. Bruni: I was just going to do
that. The following are the ten trust companies: The Canada Permanent Trust Company, The Canada Trust Company, Chartered
Trust Company, Commercial Trust Company,
The Eastern Trust Company, Guaranty Trust
Company of Canada, The Premier Trust
Company, Prudential Trust Company Limited, The Sterling Trust Corporation, and
Investors Trust Company. Honourable senators will find these companies, with one exception, listed on page 19 of the Report of
the Superintendent of Insurance for Canada
for the year ended December 31, 1956, under
the title, "Loan and Trust Companies". The
only change that it is necessary to make in
that list is to strike out "The Western Trust
Company" and substitute "Investors Trust
Company", and the ten trust companies in
Canada to which this bill applies will be
complete.
As I have stated, the bill has no application to any trust company which has been
incorporated under the laws of any province
of Canada.
There are two main amendments contained
in this bill for the benefit of trust companies,
and which have been requested by trust
companies, and these briefly are as follows:
First, the bill authorizes trust companies in
their annual statements to carry dominion
and provincial Government bonds at their
amortization value rather than at their market value. Secondly, the bill extends the
borrowing powers of trust companies from
ten times their unimpaired paid-up capital
and reserves to twelve and one-half times
their unimpaired capital and reserves.
The above mentioned ten trust companies
have been pressing the Government for a
number of years for these two amendments,

and the Government on agreeing to amend
the act as mentioned above decided to include the three following amendments; First,
the act now in existence specifies that the
minimum capital each company was required
to have before it could commence business
was $250,000 of subscribed capital, with at
least $100,000 paid thereon.
Under the
amendment proposed in this bill it will be
left to the special act incorporating each
company to specify the minimum capital
before it may commence business, this being
the same provision as is now contained in
the Insurance Act under which insurance
companies are incorporated. Secondly, the
bill provides that these trust companies shall
now file their annual statements with the
department rather than with the minister, the
minister being the Minister of Finance, this
being the practice as it now exists under the
Insurance Act. This is really an administrative convenience that will assist the department in the administration of the Trust
Companies Act.
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa Wesi): How?
Hon. Mr. Bruni: Well, under the old act
the statements are forwarded to the Minister,
then the Minister's clerk picks them up and
sends them to the Superintendent. That applies only to the ten companies. Under the
Insurance Companies Act I think there are
at least 250 companies that file statements
with the Superintendent. All the statements
come in directly to him, and he has machinery
and facilities set up to deal with them as
they come in.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Are these three additional
amendments proposed on the recommendation
of the Superintendent of Insurance?
Hon. Mr. Bruni: Oh, yes. The third change
relates to the form of the annual statement.
Originally the form of the annual statement
required to be filed by the companies when
the act was passed in 1914 was set out as
Schedule B to that act. However, there was
power in the act whereby the minister might
change the form of the statement in order to
obtain additional information about trust
companies, with the result that over the years
the form of statement has been materially
changed, so that it now bears no resemblance
to the form as set out in Schedule B to
the act as passed in 1914.
I have a copy of the statement here, if
any honourable senator would like to see it.
A great deal of information is required, much
of which was never mentioned in the statement as set out in the original act.
The proposal now is to remove the form
from the schedule altogether by repealing

SENATE
the schedule, and to leave the form of the
statement to be determined by the minister
in the same fashion and manner as under
the Insurance Act.
Now to deal briefly with the bill clause by
clause:
Clause 1. Heretofore "Department" has
never been defined, because it was never
referred to in the Trust Companies Act.
Clause 1 fully defines the word "Department",
and this is necessary more particularly by
reason of the necessity to file statements
with the department rather than with the
minister, as provided in clause Il of this
bill.
Clause 2 makes one simple change in
describing the provisional directors.
The
word "description" has been changed to
"calling" in order to really clarify the occupation of the provisional director, and further to
make this provision consistent with the corresponding provisions in the Loan Companies
Act and in the Insurance Act.
Clause 3 simply sets forth the model of
the bill which in future will have to be
presented to Parliament in order to incorporate a trust company, and such model
bill is set out in detail in the schedule to this
particular bill. Previously there were two
schedules, the first setting forth the model bill,
and the second the form of the annual statement. The latter schedule is being repealed
and will no longer form any part of the act,
and from now on there will only be one
schedule to the act which is the model bill.
Clause 4 sets out certain provisions which
must be complied with before the provisional
directors
can call a meeting of the
shareholders.
Clause 5 sets forth in detail the conditions
which have to be complied with before the
company can commence business.
Clause 6 deals with a description of the
capital stock and sets the par value of the
capital stock at $100 per share. The capital
requirement is being removed since it has
been found that it is entirely inadequate for
this day and age. I believe it was formerly
$250,000. On making a search I found that
during the past thirteen years there have
been three trust companies incorporated, and
in each case the subscribed and paid-up
capital was $1 million. Every honourable
senator will realize that a figure of $250,000
is most unrealistic in this day and age.
Hon. Mr. Power: Could the company be
incorporated with a capital of $250,000 under
the new amendment?

this bill, but I doubt very much if the
Superintendent of Insurance would ever
agree.
Is there anything to
Hon. Mr. Power:
prevent him?
Hon. Mr. Bruni: Not under the act. An
application could be presented to Parliament
for incorporation of a trust company with a
capital of $50,000, if so desired, and if Parliament passed it the company could be incorporated with that amount of capital, but
I doubt if it would ever be able to do
business.
Hon. Mr. Euler: What was the reason for
lowering the amount?
Hon. Mr. Bruni: The only change made
was that the quarter-million dollars was
taken out.
Hon. Mr. Euler: But why take it out?
Hon. Mr. Bruni: Because it is an unrealistic
figure. In the last thirteen years there have
been only three trust companies incorporated,
and in each case the capital was $1 million.
Hon. Mr. Euler: I understand that, but you
are making it possible for a company to apply
for incorporation with a capital of any amount
less than a quarter-million.
Hon. Mr. Bruni: Yes, but I do not think that
Parliament would ever pass it.
Hon. Mr. Euler: I see.
Hon. Mr. Bruni: Well, if you want to amend
it further it can be done in committee.
Hon. Mr. Euler: I would say, put the limit
up rather than down.
Hon. Mr. Bruni: Well, we can do that in
committee. This is one of the amendments
that is being asked for by the department,
not by the trust companies.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: They do not care; they
are already incorporated.
Hon. Mr. Bruni: That is right, they are
in business.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: This would make it easier
to incorporate companies, would it not?

Hon. Mr. Bruni: I do not know whether it
would make it any easier or not, but I do
not think you would ever get a bill through
Parliament with such a provision in it. Would
you approve a bill against the advice of the
superintendent? Would you go against the
advice of officials of the department?
Hon. Mr. Power: I have done that many a

Hon. Mr. Euler: Why make smaller capital
is set out in the model bill, which I will
refer to later and which is the schedule to possible, even if it is improbable?

JULY 10, 1958
Hon. Mr. Power: I was not quite satisfied
with the explanation given by the honourable senator as to why it is proposed to dispense with this floor of $250,000. The
argument of my honourable friend was really
that the floor should be raised, because he
said every company that has been incorporated in the last thirteen years bas had a
capital of $1 million.
Hon. Mr. Bruni: That is correct.
Clause 7 deals with the books of account
which the trust company will be compelled
to keep. I think this is the important part
of the clause: the books of account showing
the liabilities of the trust company to the
public shall be kept separate and distinct
from the other books of account of the
company.
Hon. Mr. Power: That is in the present act?
Hon. Mr. Bruni: Yes.
Hon. Mr. Power: There is no change there.
Hon. Mr. Bruni: There is a change there.
Hon. Mr. Power: Not in the present section.
The only change seems to be the addition of
the words "adequate to enable it to prepare"
in the first part of the clause, so that it would
read:
The company shall keep books of account adequate
to enable it to prepare the annual statement required
by section 72,-

Surely you expect any trust company to
make adequate statements. I do not know
how the addition of the word "adequate"
would strengthen the legislation. That appears
to be bureaucratic.
Hon. Mr. Bruni: I did not draft the bill.
Hon. Mr. Power: But you are stuck with it.
Hon. Mr. Bruni: Well, it is not a bad bill
with which to be stuck.
Clause 8 contains a very simple amendment.
It adds a new court to those specified in the
act, namely, the Territorial Court of the
Northwest Territories. This court has been
set up recently.
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): Before
going on with clause 8, would the honourable
gentleman say, in connection with clause 7,
if there is a section in the act which provides
for the making of regulations so that the
companies concerned would know whether
they were keeping books of account adequate
within the meaning of the word in clause 7?
Hon. Mr. Bruni: I think the answer will
be found in a section further which provides
for inspection of the books of the companies by officials of the Superintendent of
Insurance.

Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Who is competent to
determine whether the books being kept are
adequate?
Hon. Mr. Bruni: I should think the company's auditors would be quite competent to
determine that. In any event, the officials of
the department who make an independent
inspection of the books of all trust companies
which are incorporated under dominion legislation would be competent.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: You think the Superintendent of Insurance could say to a company, "This is not adequate, you must do it
differently"?
Hon. Mr. Bruni: Very definitely. His inspection of the books of any trust company is
a very close inspection and in certain cases
he has uncovered matter that the companies'
auditors let go by.
I come now to clause 9. Ahi trust companies in addition to filing an annual statement were always required to file a copy of
their auditor's annual report. In the past such
auditors' reports have always been filed with
the minister, but from the passing of this bill
the auditors' reports will be filed along with
the annual statement and deposited with the
department.
Clause 10 deals with the first request of
the trust companies, namely, that of increasing their borrowing powers from ten to
twelve and one-half times the amount of
the unimpaired paid-up capital and reserve
of the company. Borrowed money includes in
the main: (1) moneys borrowed from a bank
or a lending institution or an individual;
(2) moneys on deposit in savings and current
accounts; (3) moneys left in trust for investment, the repayment of which is guaranteed
by the trust company.
For such money trust companies issue
certificates which are commonly known as
guaranteed investment receipts and/or guaranteed investment certificates.
In connection with this particular clause
I would like to add the following remarks.
At the present time trust companies are
limited to accepting deposits by way of
guaranteed investment receipts and certificates and savings deposits to a total amount
of ten times their unimpaired capital and
reserve.
Presumably this restriction is in the interest of guaranteeing depositors of the safety
of their moneys and to this extent the theory
is praiseworthy. However, the restriction is
much more onerous in the case of trust companies than in the case of other institutions
accepting moneys from the public. The banks
are not so restricted. For example, the Canadian Bank of Commerce and the TorontoDominion Bank have deposits totalling

SENATE
approximately twenty-six times their capital
and reserve; the Royal Bank of Canada and
the Imperial Bank of Canada are eighteen
times; the Bank of Nova Scotia, seventeen
times; the Banque Canadienne Nationale,
twenty-one times; and the Bank of Montreal, fourteen times. Similarily, in the case
of life insurance companies there is no prescribed ratio between the amount of public
money which they may receive and the size
of their capital. As a matter of fact, the
recent legislation permitting mutualization of
such companies recognized that institutions
of this nature may, with propriety, accept
money from the public for which they have
an obligation to repay without any capital
whatsoever.
Honourable senators will recall that at
the last session amendments to the Canadian
and British Insurance Companies Act were
passed under which stock companies can
now get rid of their stock and become mutual
companies. In view of the excellent record
of the Canadian trust companies for the
security of depositors, it is therefore appropriate that this limit be raised from ten to
twelve and one-half times, as is proposed by
this bill.
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): Would
the honourable gentleman tell us whether
those figures which he gave are for one
specific year or are average figures?
Hon. Mr. Bruni: I would say they are the
figures that existed during the earlier part
of this year when I prepared these remarks.
Clause 11 relates to the filing of the annual
statement with the department, rather than
with the minister. This is one of the amendments which the department asked for.
Clause 12 deals with the second request of
the trust companies.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Before my friend leaves
that point, may I ask a question? The present
law provides that the companies cannot lend
more than ten times their paid-up capital
and reserves. Could he tell me whether with
respect to the provincially-incorporated companies there is any variation in that regard?
Hon. Mr. Bruni: I have no information on
that point, and I think the department in
Ottawa bas little or no information about it.
The inspection of the books is made by provincial officials, and the federal department
has little or nothing to do with them.
Hon. Mr. Euler: I just asked the question
for information.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: I am wondering if this
legislation is for the purpose of putting in
line a company that has already accepted for
deposit more than it bas any right to accept.

Hon. Mr. Bruni: I do not think so. The
companies have for years been trying to get
this legislation through Parliament, and the
department has finally decided to go along
with them. I do not think it is for the benefit
of any one trust company, but for the benefit
of the ten companies which I named earlier.
Clause 12 deals with the valuation at which
companies may carry dominion and provincial
bonds in their annual statements. Previously
such bonds were required to be carried at
the market value. Now the companies will
be allowed to carry such investment at their
amortized value. This method of valuing
bonds for annual statement purposes was
authorized for the life insurance companies in
1950, for the chartered banks and the Quebec
savings banks in 1957; and the Bank of
Canada, of its own accord, without consulting
anybody, used this method for the first time
in the preparation of its annual statement for
the year 1956.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Was that by statute or
by regulation, or how was it?
Hon. Mr. Bruni: Just by the officials themselves; they decided they would make the
change and they did so in the preparation of
their statement for the year 1956.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: That is the last one.
You gave us two or three illustrations. Was
this covered by the Bank Act?
Hon. Mr. Bruni: It was authorized, so it
must have been by legislation. My information is that it was authorized for the life
insurance companies in 1950, so there must
have been an amendment to the Insurance
Act.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Would my honourable
friend get that information for us?
Hon. Mr. Bruni: I will have it for you
when the matter is considered in committee;
Mr. MacGregor will be there and will have
all the information you require in regard to
this.
It might be of interest to many honourable senators to know that several British
banks have adopted the same method for
valuing similar securities. The wording of
this particular clause is based upon a similar section of the Insurance Act.
In connection with the valuing of bonds
on an amortized basis, I would like to make
The showing of
this further statement.
bonds at their amortized value is the
standard accounting method used by financial institutions in dealing with the problem
of acquiring bonds from time to time at
other than their par value. It means, in
effect, that the difference between the purchase price and the eventual par value of

JULY 10, 1958
the bond at maturity is taken into account
in the income of the investing institution,
and this difference is dealt with in equal
instalments over the remaining life of the
bond. For instance, if a bond were acquired
at 95, the difference between the purchase
price and the eventual pay-off at maturity
is added to the income account of the investing institution in equal, usually semi-annual,
instalments. That is to say, in this example,
50 cents would be added to the book value
of the investment in each year of the 10
years; so at maturity the book value would
coincide with the par value, which would
be repaid. Conversely, if such a bond were
purchased at 105 it would be reduced 50
cents each year for the 10 years it was held.
I offer that example for a 10-year bond.
Hon. Mr. Euler: If the market value of
that 10-year bond goes below the purchase
price of 95, what happens?
Hon. Mr. Bruni: I am coming to that.
Hon. Mr. Euler: I am sorry, I seem to be
out of turn.

the purchase price paid by the trust company,
perhaps years before. Am I not right in
that?
Hon. Mr. Bruni: No, the book value has
nothing to do with it. It is either the
market value or the amortized value, and I
have endeavoured to explain to honourable
senators how the amortized value is calculated.
I can see nothing dangerous in this proposal:
the banks are using it, the insurance companies are using it, the Bank of Canada
uses it, and the English banks use it. I do
not think any trust company is going to
become bankrupt because bonds are valued
on an amortized basis instead of at their
market value.
Hon. Mr. Euler: When a bond is purchased
in the first place, as you suggest, at 95, that
is the book value. At that time the book
value and the market value are the same; and
that amount is only increased by the payment,
as you say, of 50 cents each year for the
10-year period?
Hon. Mr. Bruni: Yes.
Hon. Mr. Euler: So the book value and
market value at the time of the purchase
of the bond are the same?
Hon. Mr. Bruni: That is correct.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: But that may not be
so five years from now.
Hon. Mr. Euler: No; the market value may
be lower.

Hon. Mr. Bruni: An amortization schedule
is set up at the time the bond is purchased.
At any given time, the amortized value is
determined and recorded from the schedule,
being the original purchase price, plus or
minus amortization to date.
This will answer the honourable senator's
question: The amortized value does not, of
course, reflect the current market price of
the bond. That is to say, the bond originally

purchased at 95 will have an amortized above or below

Hon. Mr. Euler: And are taxable.
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): -and
become taxable thereby?
Hon. Mr. Bruni: If I may just proceed
with my speech I think it will explain the
matter raised by the honourable senator
from Ottawa West (Hon. Mr. Connolly).
This system of using amortized values
and yields is standard in the bond investing
business and is the basis upon which, for
example, trust companies and other financial
institutions compute their income for taxation purposes.
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Otiawa West): In other
words, they are deemed to be traders for
the purposes of the Income Tax Act?
Hon. Mr. Bruni: That is right. Companies
incorporated under the dominion Trust
Companies Act have been required to use
market values for the purpose of arriving
at the value of the bonds in which they
have invested, and the adverse effect of this
upon their business from time to time may

company with a paid-up capital and reserve
of $2,500,000. Under the existing legislation
such a company can accept deposits from
the public up to ten times its capital; in
other words, $25 million. Assume further
that of these deposit moneys $10 million are
invested in mortgages and $15 million in
bonds. If the market on these bonds declines
5 per cent-and there have been declines
of even greater magnitude within recent
years, owing to changes in fiscal policy and
other circumstances-the market value of
these bonds might decline by as much as

nominally deduct this sum from its capital
and reserve, this would reduce the $2,500,000
to $1,750,000 and hence reduce the total
amount which the company might accept by
way of deposits to $17,500,000.
Hon. Mr. Power: The $17,500,000 would be
guaranteed by something, whereas the $25
million is only guaranteed by fictitious value.
Hon. Mr. Bruni: If the honourable gentleman will just wait I will cover that point.
This would pose an almost impossible situation, in that it would require companies to
refuse to accept deposits and actually to
repay their certificates as they matured.
The argument has always been that if
the companies had to pay off their depositors
at a given date they would only obtain

true if one were to assume that the companies concerned were going out of business;
then they would incur a loss-the difference
between market and amortized value of
their bonds. Even in this eventuality it

should be noted that this loss would be
recoverable against income tax, so that in
effect only half of it would be a loss on
capital account. However, in practice the
trust companies feel that it is perfectly safe
and not unrealistic to assume: (1) that they
will not be required to pay off all their
deposits at any given time; (2) that they
should not be required to set up reserves
against Dominion and Provincial bonds and,
in effect, underwrite changes in market
value brought about by changes in monetary
conditions and policy over which they have
no control.
Trust companies believe that they may,
with propriety, assume that the obligations
of Canada and its provinces will always be
paid off at par at maturity, as has been
the case in the past.
The use of amortized values for Government returns is recognized in the case of life
insurance companies, Quebec savings banks
and chartered banks and the Bank of
Canada. There would therefore seem to be
no reason why trust companies should not
enjoy the same ruling. This change will avoid
unnecessary hampering of trust companies in
their worthwhile efforts to expand their savings activities and thus encourage thrift
amongst the population generally.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Would the senator permit
me to ask another question? It is a business
of trust companies, of course, to be in charge
of various estates. My question, which may
not be germane to the bill, is this: Which
value is taken into consideration for succession duty purposes, the amortized value
or the market value?
Hon. Mr. Bruni: The market value.
Hon. Mr. Euler: I should think se.
Hon. Mr. Prail: I understand that this act
applies only to a certain number of trust
companies registered under a dominion
charter.
Hon. Mr. Bruni: They are incorporated
under the laws of the Dominion of Canada.
Hon. Mr. Prati: Yes. I understand from
you that so far as these companies under
dominion charter are concerned, it is provided under this measure that profits from
buying and selling securities are to be brought
in as income and losses are to be deductible
for income tax purposes. What would be the
position of trust companies incorporated by
the provinces? Would they be brought in
under this measure in that respect?
Hon. Mr. Bruni: It depends; if those companies value their bonds on an amortized
basis they will be treated exactly the same

JULY 10, 1958
as dominion companies. On the other hand,
if they value them on a market-value basis,
that is the basis that will be used for taxation
purposes.
Hon. Mr. Pratt: In other words, with respect
to federal taxation there will not be any
difference between trust companies under
dominion charter and those under provincial
charter?
Hon. Mr. Bruni: Oh, no.
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Oiawa West): We are
not amending the Income Tax Act by this
legislation.
Hon. Mr. Bruni: No.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: For what purpose is the
amortized value being taken? Is it to enable
the department to judge of the solvency of
the trust companies?
I have not read the
dominion Trust Companies Act recently, but
for a number of years I did head the Department of Insurance for the province of Ontario.
The big question in our minds at that time
was the solvency of these trust companies,
for we became responsible for them, and I
think the dominion department is responsible
for the continued solvency of the companies
whom they accept.
Hon. Mr. Euler: I belleve that at the time
my friend refers to the companies were
allowed to fix arbitrary values for securities.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Yes, they did when I
was in charge of the department. We fixed
the value that we would allow for various
investments held by trust companies. We considered very carefully, whether they should
be allowed to carry on or what they should
be required to do to get further capital, and
that sort of thing, before we would allow
them to continue to act as trust companies.
Now, do I understand that this change affects
the value which the department will use in
judging the continued solvency of a trust
company?
Hon. Mr. Bruni: It is quite impossible for
me to attempt to answer that. I do not know
the basis or the theory the department uses
in coming to a conclusion as to whether a
company is solvent or not-I have no idea.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: But I am asking what
is the purpose in specifying the amortized
value? What use will you make of that
valuation?

amount a company could accept on deposit
might be reduced from $25 million to
$17,500,000.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: If that were the only
reason for this change in valuation it would
not be so important, but if there is another
purpose and another use to be made of this
valuation, then I would like to know it.
Hon. Mr. Bruni: Well, we will leave that
until the bill goes to a committee, and Mr.
MacGregor is present to give further
information.
Clause 13 of the bill provides for the
examination of a trust company's books by
the Superintendent of Insurance or any of
his agents.
Clause 14 is a penalty section providing
for the imposition of a penalty for the late
filing of a statement, and under this particular clause such a statement must be filed
by a specific date with the department. If
it is not filed by that date, then a penalty
of ten dollars a day is imposed. Incidentally,
the penalty has been reduced under this bill
from $20 a day to $10 a day, in order to
make the provision consistent with a similar
provision in the Insurance Act.
Clause 15 refers to a schedule in the bill
which sets out the form of the act which has
to be used in future for the incorporation
of all trust companies. The main change in
the model bill is that hereafter the minimum
capital required to be subscribed and paid
before the company may commence business
shall be specified in that company's act of
incorporation. Finally, clause 15 also repeals
schedule B of the present act relating to the
formal annual statement which will be filed
with the department.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Does that make any
reference to clause 13, which says:
The superintendent shall visit personally, or
cause a duly qualified member of his staff to visit,
at least once in each year, the head office of each
company and examine carefully the statements of
the condition and affairs of each company, and
report thereon to the minister as to all matters
requiring his attention and decision.

Does that not indicate that the superintendent
shall examine books, and so on, in order to
judge of the solvency of the trust companies?
Hon. Mr. Bruni: I cannot put that interpretation on it. If the honourable senator
wants to put that interpretation on it, he
may do so, but I cannot.

FOR

SECOND READING-DEBATE
ADJOURNED

Hon. William R. Bruni moved the second
reading of Bill S-10, to amend the Loan
Companies Act.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Honourable senators,
the remarks I made with respect to Bill S-11,
which has just been considered, apply equally
to Bill S-10. I suggest that if the honourable

Hon.

John

J.

Connolly

(Otiawa

moved the second reading of Bill S-13,
respecting the Algoma Central and Hudson
Bay Railway Company.
He said: Honourable senators, I apologize
for having to keep honourable senators here
this afternoon at this late stage, but this is a
private measure, and of course it will have to
wait for a week before getting to committee.
For that reason I should like to explain the
measure now, and I shall do so as briefly as
possible.
The Algoma Central and Hudson Bay Railway Company was incorporated in 1899 by
the Statutes of Canada, chapter 50 of that
year. The head office of the company is in

JULY
Sault Ste. Marie. The company has a main
line of railway 298 miles running between the
Soo and Hearst, and a branch line of some 26
miles running from the Soo to Michipicoten
Harbour.
The charter of this company has been
amended many times since the original incorporation, as the marginal note will indicate.
I understand that the company was part of
a large enterprise that was established in the
Soo area before the turn of the century, and
that the important personage in that enterprise was a man who may be known at least
by reputation to some honourable senatorsFrancis Hector Clergue. He was born in the
United States, apparently. He became a
lawyer, but later on be was more interested
in engineering projects and he began the development of hydraulic power at the Saint
Mary's Falls near Sault Ste. Marie. He built
various factories and transportation lines to
utilize this power. These projects which were
completed at a cost of $30 million, comprised
blast furnaces, steel rail rolling mills, iron,
copper and nickel mines, reducing and refining works, chemical works, pulp mills,
steamship lines, and the Algoma Central and
Hudson Bay Railway. Obviously he was a
man of some partsHon. Mr. Roebuck: He was a master
promoter.
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): -because he was called by newspapermen "the
Cecil Rhodes of Canada", and by the New
York Herald-and this appears to coincide
with the view expressed by the honourable
senator from Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck)-"the greatest word painter in the line
of modern promoters". One of the distinguished members of this chamber said to me
today, "He was a man who was 50 years
before his time." In time, the enterprises be
promoted in the Soo area, which were known
generally as the Lake Superior Corporation
Limited, fell upon bad times, but at present
a good many of them are very thriving
enterprises.
Now, to come to the detail of the bill. At
present the capital structure of the company
consists of equity securities and debt securities. The equity securities consist of common
stock, some 420,755 shares of a par value of
$10 each, and the registered holder of these
shares is the Royal Trust Company in Montreal, which holds them as trustee for the
owners of voting trust certificates. The total
value of this portion of its capital is $4,207,550.
It bas also issued 125,000 preferred shares
having a par value of $4 each, and the total
value of that capital is $500,000.
It also bas first mortgage income debenture
stock and bonds, bearing interest at 5 per

cent, and the total face value of these securities is $10,308,500. There was a second mortgage issue of 6 per cent 50 year gold bonds
having a total face value of $318,800. These
latter have been surrendered and were
cancelled in 1937.
In 1941 there was a scheme of arrangement
agreed upon by the various security holders,
and interest was made cumulative on the first
mortgage income debenture stock and bonds
which I have said have a total face value of
$10,308,500. These bonds mature on December
3, 1959, and the interest due on them on
the 2nd of June 1958 was $5,729,808.
The main purpose of the bill is to secure
funds to retire the principal amount of the
first mortgage income debenture stock and
bonds, some $10 million, plus the accumulated
interest thereon, some $5,700,000; also to retire
the preferred stock, 125,000 shares issued at a
par value of $4 each, and to pay whatever
expenses are involved in this alteration of
capital.
Hon. Mr. Bruni: Would the honourable
senator permit a question?
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): Yes.
Hon. Mr. Bruni: Has the company not been
paying off the arrears of interest during the
past few years, at a rather rapid rate?
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): Yes, I
understand it has made quite a sizeable reduction in the interest that accumulated over
the years, but there still is $5,728,808 of
interest due as of the 2nd of June this year.
Hon. Mr. Bruni: I understand there has
been a protective committee set up in connection with the bonds on which the arrears
of interest are owing, and such being the
case does the protective committee approve
of this bill?
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): Yes, I
am informed it does.
Hon. Mr. Farris: I did not quite understand
my honourable friend when he said the
purpose of this bill was to secure funds to
pay off these bonds and interest. I did not
understand what the miracle was.
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): The
main purpose of the bill is to increase the
capital to enable the company to get funds
to retire these securities.
Hon. Mr. Bruni: Is it the purpose of the
company to pay off the bonds and all arrears
of interest, in cash?
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): I suppose it would be cash for the people who
did not take alternative securities. Perhaps
the answer to that will emerge from what
I am about to say on section 3 of the bill,

SENATE
because the method that is proposed to
be used is set out in that section. It proposes to increase the capital of the company.
At the present time there are 420,752
common shares having a par value of $10.
It is proposed to increase this number of
common shares by the addition of 579,245
new common shares also having a par
value of $10, and they will rank equally with
the existing common shares. When sold the
proceeds will provide $5,792,450 of additional capital for the company.
In addition to that the company proposes
to issue 250,000 preferred shares having a
par value of $50 each. This stock when sold
will provide $12,500,000 of additional capital.
In this way there will be more than
$18 million of new capital made available
to the company. It will enable the company to look after the retirement of the
existing first mortage income debenture
stock and bonds, and the preferred stock,
plus the interest on the first mortgage
bonds, plus expenses, and then some.
Hon. Mr. Bruni: I gather there are no
arrears of dividends on the preferred stock?
It is not cumulative?
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): It is
not cumulative, in any event, and I do not
believe there are any arrears of interest.
That, honourable senators, is the main
purpose of the bill. There are some other
minor points on which I might touch.
By section 1 of the bill the company is
authorized to issue bonds to a maximum of
$11 million, upon the security of the company's assets.
Section 3, subsection 2, authorizes the
company to determine the privileges which
the preferred shares shall carry, authorizes
the company in appropriate conditions to
subdivide the shares into shares of lesser
par value than provided in this measure,
provided of course that two-thirds of the
votes cast at a special meeting of the shareholders affected approve of such a proposal.
Section 4 provides that the redemption of
preferred shares in the circumstances described in section 4-and I am told section
4 is a verbatim reproduction of section 61
of the Companies Act-shall not constitute
a reduction of the capital, if it is done in
the manner prescribed.
There is one further point I must draw to
the attention of honourable senators. An
explanatory note to this bill states that this
matter has been approved by the holders of
the voting trust certificates. That note, I
am informed, was prepared and printed at a
time when it was thought this bill would
be coming to Parliament at a later date than
it has actually come. The meetings referred

to in the note have not been held and will
not be held until a week or ten days from
now.
As I said originally, all of the common
shares of this company are registered in the
name of the Royal Trust Company, which
acts as trustee for the holders of the voting
trust certificates. I am informed, there will
be, an official of the Royal Trust Company at
the committee meeting when this bill is considered-that will be the committee on
Transport and Communications-who will inform honourable senators as to the instructions the trustee has received to approve
the proposals contained in this measure. I
thought it well to draw the attention of
honourable senators to the fact that the explanatory note 'contained a statement that
was not correct.
This is the explanation I have to off er,
honourable senators, and I hope that the bill
will receive second reading today.
Hon. Mr. Bruni: Would the honourable
senator care to comment on clause 5 of the
bill with respect to the payment of commission? Is that provision necessary in a
bill of this kind?
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): As the
honourable gentleman knows, the payment
of commission for the sale of securities
usually bas to be specifically provided for
in a charter granted under the Companies
Act. Certainly the rate is not unusual, and
I think generally companies feel a little
more secure in having specific provision for
the payment of commission. It is there as
an additional precaution.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: May I ask a rather
pertinent question? Is there any assurance
that these securities will be saleable when
they are granted?
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Otiawa West): I am
not at all sure that I can answer that question to the satisfaction of the honourable senator. I should think that the company would
not come here seeking this authority if it did
not feel that it was going to be able to reorganize and do so by selling the proposed
new securities. I think the company, as a
matter of fact, is doing very well. I understand it has progressed very favourably over
the past few years and has every expectation
that the market will absorb what the company proposes to offer.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: By way of explanation
of my question, may I say that I have the
best of good will towards this company. A
little more than a year ago I spent nearly
a week in Sudbury bringing about a very
extensive wage agreement between the

JULY 10, 1958
management of this company and its employees. While there I met a most admirable
man, an intelligent and active gentleman who
had just taken over the management of the
company. I rather fancy that this effort to
clean up the old financing is due to the
progressive attitude of the new management,
and I wish them all possible success.
Hon. Mr. Bruni: I hope the honourable
senator was not too tough in the wage agreement he brought about, in view of the fact
that the company is in arrears on its bond
interest.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: The honourable
senator is noted for his fairness.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: The management agreed
to the terms, at about 3 o'clock in the
morning.
Motion agreed to and bill read second
time.

There are two authorities: the New York
authority incorporated in the State of New
York, and the authority in Canada incorporated by this Parliament. When these
authorities were first incorporated, in 1952,
it was believed that the bridge could be built
for $10 million. In 1956 the authorities were
granted by Parliament the right to increase
the money that they might raise to $15
million. Now it is found that up to perhaps
$25 million will be required.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Is that on account of
a change in the structure of the bridge?
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): I am
informed it is due mainly to the rise in the
cost of materials and labour required for a
structure of this kind.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: The costs have not
doubled in the last few years.

say, they may have been over-optimistic

necessary to make an announcement of this
kind because it notifies the litigants that they
must have their cases completed, if it is
possible for them to do so, by the date specified if they wish to be heard at this session.
It is the custorn to make such an announcement every session. No hardship will be
caused by the committee's decision. We have
been hearing cases now since some time in
May and at any time during that period any
one of these cases that was ready to be heard

STRATFORD SHAKESPEAREAN
FESTIVAL
ENGAGEMENT OF LANGSTON HUGHES

Hon. Felix P. Quinn: Honourable senators,
before the Orders of the Day are called I
wish to draw to the attention of honourable
senators an article which appeared in a publication addressed to me in the Senate this
past week. The publication is called the
Canadian Intelligence Service, and its principal article is headed "Is this Canadian Culture?" It quotes from the Globe and Mail of
June 14 as follows:
Langston Hughes, Negro poet and novelist, will
make two appearances at the Stratford Festival on
July 23. In addition to his reading of some of his
own poetry to the music of Henry "Red" Allen's All

Stars on the regular jazz series, Mr. Hughes will
present a special afternoon program of poetry
reading, called Poetry Born of Music. The latter
will be open only to those who register before July
1 for Vivienne Stenson's two day Folksong and Jazz
session on July 23 and 24. Mr. Hughes classifies his
program for this session as "various of my poems
with a biographical background, describing how in
some cases the poems were written, and stressing
particularly their folk sources in the blues, spiritual
and jazz idioms".
Langston Hughes is the U.S. mulatto whose
"poetry" includes the anti-Christian "Good-bye
Christ". This blasphemous attack upon our Lord
includes these words: "Good-bye, Christ Jesus, Lord
God Jehova, Beat it on away from here now. Make
way for a new guy with no religion at all-A real
guy named Marx, Communist Lenin, Peasant Stalin,
Worker

Me

.

.

.

And

step

on the

gas

Christ!

Move! Don't be se slow about movin'! The world
is mine from now on-And nobody's gonna sell
me to a king or a general, or a millionaire."
Net surprising is the fact that Langston Hughes
boasts a pro-communist record including 70 RedFront affiliations.

Honourable senators, here is the meat of
the article and the reason I am bringing it
to your attention.
The Stratford Festival is subsidized by the Canada
Council, which is spending no less than $100 million
taken frorn the Canadian taxpayers.

I do not subscribe to this publication, and
as it came to me gratuitously in the mail
surely other honourable senators and perhaps
membcrs of the House of Commons also
received copies of it. At any rate, somebody
besides myself should be interested in such
an irreverent thing as this, and that is why
I am bringing it to the attention of the Senate.
If Canada and her taxpayers subscribe to the
likes of this, it is pretty near time that somebody should make a protest, and if I am the
only one to do so I protest with all the vigour
within me against such blasphemy. I appeal
to my honourable leader (Hon. Mr. Aseltine)
to make representations to the proper authorities to have this blasphemous creature's
appearance before the Canadian public cancelled. He is scheduled to appear before the
Stratford Festival on July 23, a week from
next Wednesday.
Hon. Mr. Pouliot: Honourable senators, I
strongly approve of the remarks of the
honourable gentleman from Bedford-Halifax
(Hon. Mr. Quinn). They should be forwarded

Hon. W. Ross Macdonald: Honourable
senators, may I refer to the matter raised
earlier in the sitting by the honourable
senator from Bedford-Halifax (Hon. Mr.
Quinn). The pamphlet to which he referred
did not come to my desk. It is possible that
it may have been delivered to my office, that
my secretary may have read it and concluded

JULY 15, 1958
that it was too blasphemous for my eyes
and for that reason did not put it on my desk.
In any event, I did not see it.
The honourable senator stated that the
Stratford Festival was sponsored by the
Canada Council. May I say that that is not
quite correct. It is true to the extent that
the Canada Council did make a contribution
toward the cost of the erection of the permanent festival building at Stratford, as did
the province of Ontario and many businesses.
But it cannot be said of the Stratford Festival that it is being sponsored by the Canada
Council.
Hon. Mr. Croll: Honourable senators, I read
the sheet to which the honourable senator
from Bedford-Halifax referred. I know the
sheet; it is a hate sheet. In my opinion it
was utter unadulterated garbage, and I gave
it the treatment it dezerved-I threw it in
the wastepaper basket.
Hon. Mr. Quinn: Honourable senators, may
I reply? I quoted the article because it was
said to have been copied from the Toronto
Globe and Mail, which I consider to be a
reliable newspaper. (See pp. 328-9.)

for second reading this evening, namely,
the bill to amend the Loan Companies Act.
I feel that we should hear not only from the
representative of the Department of Insurance, but also from representatives of the
trust companies; I think an opportunity
should be given to them and to anyone else
who desires it to come forward and speak
either in favour of or against the bill. It is
not necessary to hurry the bill through this
week. I suggest that notices be sent out,
that the committee meet tomorrow, and that
we have a full discussion in the presence
of all persons interested in the bill some
time next week.

Hon. A. K. Hugessen: Honourable senators,
I had an opportunity of examining this bill
over the weekend. I was not present at the
sitting of the Senate on Thursday afternoon,
but I read with a great deal of interest the
extremely competent and full explanation
given by the honourable senator from
Hanover (Hon. Mr. Brunt).
This bill, of course, deals only with those
trust companies which have been incorporated under the federal Trust Companies Act,
and the honourable senator enumerated them

No doubt this is a bill which should go to and dominion and provincial guaranteed
committee, and what I say now applies also bonds held by them, not at their then current
to another bill which is on the Order Paper market values but at their amortization value.

SENATE
Well, I discussed both these points with the
officials of the two large trust companies. As
to the first point, the increase in the permitted borrowing powers, neither of them
felt that this was in any way out of the way.
Both of them told me that as far as their
own companies are concerned, under the provincial legislation to which they are subject
they have no legislative limit at all on the
amount that they can borrow. They do have
a self-imposed limit upon their borrowing,
which is roughly of the order of ten times
their paid-up capital, but they pointed out
that so far as these federal companies are
concerned they are more limited in the
classes of investments which they can invest
in than are the provincial companies; and
also they will, of course, be subject to the
control and inspection of the Superintendent
of Insurance.
So I think as far as the first point is concerned we can rest satisfied that that is a
reasonable suggestion. As to the second point,
the valuation by these companies of their
portfolio of dominion and provincial bonds
and dominion and provincial guaranteed
bonds, that again seemed to these gentlemen
to be a reasonable suggestion. They pointed
out, as I think the honourable senator from
Hanover, indeed, pointed out, that the chartered banks at the present time are obliged to
show their dominion and provincial bonds in
that fashion in their balance sheets and that
the insurance companies have the right to
do so if they wish. So as far as these two
main features of the bill are concerned I
think we can rest assured that there is nothing objectionable in them, and that as far as
the two companies whose officers I consulted
with in the matter are concerned, they are
perfectly satisfied with the bill in its present
form.

On motion of Hon. Mr. Brunt, bill referred
to Standing Committee on Banking and
Commerce.
LOAN COMPANIES BILL
SECOND READING

The Senate resumed from Thursday, July
10, the adjourned debate on the motion of
Hon. Mr. Brunt for second reading of Bill
S-10, to amend the Loan Companies Act.
Hon. W. Ross Macdonald: Honourable
senators, what I said in connection with the
bill which bas just received second reading
applies equally to this bill.
The honourable senator from Hanover
(Hon. Mr. Brunt) has mentioned two witnesses who will be called before the Committee tomorrow morning. I am not so sure
that there are not other witnesses who should
be called. However, we can discuss that in
committee. I approve of having the meeting
tomorrow.
Hon. Arthur W. Roebuck: Honourable senators, may I just say a word in connection
with this bill? The gentlemen who are coming
as witnesses will appear for the purpose of
supporting the bill. Personally I am not so
well satisfied as are others who have expressed
themselves to give to these companies the
right to value their assets on an arbitrary
basis rather than upon their market value.

I am not prepared to make an attack on
the bill. When I was minister in charge of
such matters in the province of Ontario I

Dear Mr. Speaker:
Before I leave this lovely city and this friendly
country, I want once again to thank you for the
privilege of appearing before a joint session of
Parliament and, in particular, for the warmth of
the comments you made on my talk. Fortunately
I can understand French a little better than I can
speak it (the latter deficiency I have fully demonstrated) and I was indeed touched by the sentiments you expressed.

For my part this visit has been both valuable and
important. I return to Washington with a renewed
conviction that our countries are strong in our
friendship and that we have the good will and
understanding necessary to work out any differences
that may arise between us.
And, of course, not the least of the pleasure of
my contacts with you was on the golf course yesterday. I thoroughly enjoyed the afternoon, although
I do wish I could have exhibited a little better
game.
With my personal thanks, once again, to you and
to the members of the Senate for the courteous and
cordial reception you gave me, and warm regard,
Sincerely,
Dwight D. Eisenhower

Speaker of the Senate,

STRATFORD SHAKESPEAREAN
FESTIVAL
ENGAGEMENT OF LANGSTON HUGHES

On the Orders of the Day:
Hon. Felix P. Quinn: Honourable senators,
before the Orders of the Day are proceeded
with, I wish to make a correction in my
remarks of yesterday as reported in Hansard
at page 324. In connection with scheduled
appearances of Langston Hughes, a Negro poet
and novelist, at the Stratford Shakespearean
Festival, I read a few paragraphs of an
article in a publication called the Canadian
Intelligence Service. All the paragraphs purported to have been quoted from the Toronto
Globe and Mail, but the fact is that only the
first paragraph was a quotation from that
newspaper and the remainder of the article I
quoted was comment by the Canadian Intelligence Service itself.
Hon. David A. Croll: Honourable senators,
I too had something to say when the honourable senator from Bedford-Halifax (Hon.
Mr. Quinn) spoke on this matter last night.
I, of course, welcome his statement. The
observation I wish to make casts no reflection
upon the honourable gentleman. He did the
right and proper thing at the very earliest
time. I merely wish to repeat that this hate
sheet misled our honourable colleague as it
was intended to mislead him and as it was
intended to mislead others. The honourable
senator made this statement last night:
Ionourable senators, here is the meat of the
article and the reason I am bringing it to your
attention.

He then quoted the following from the
sheet he had received in the mail:
"The Stratford Festival is subsidized by the
Canada Council, which is spending no less than
$100 million taken from the Canadian taxpayers."

The writer of that article wanted to give
the impression that the Stratford Shakespearean Festival was receiving $100 million
from the Canadian taxpayers. That, of course,
is a gross exaggeration. I am sure that most

Hon. Jean-François Pouliot: Honourable
senators, I suggested yesterday that the
remarks of the honourable senator from
Bedford-Halifax (Hon. Mr. Quinn) should
be referred to Father Lévesque, who is supposed to be the chaplain of the Canada
Council. I have no objection to what my
honourable friend from Toronto-Spadina
(Hon. Mr. Croîl) has said about the Stratford
Festival, and I have heard a lot of praise
of that organization. But for me that is not
the question at all; rather, it is whether or
not a man who commits blasphemy, which
is an offence against the Criminal Code,
should be invited by the Stratford Festival
to make an appearance.
Hon. Mr. Quinn: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Pouliot: There is a general
tendency in the C.B.C. and elsewhere to hurt
the religious feelings of our fellow citizens.
For instance, two years ago some blasphemous
verse was read over the whole French network of the C.B.C. I wrote to Montreal, to
the man who was supposed to be in charge
of the program, and asked for a copy of that
so-called poem, and I had to get in touch
with the late Minister of National Revenue,
who was in charge of the C.B.C., to receive
an answer, which took three weeks more.
And finally what was the excuse that I got
from the representative of the C.B.C.? It
was that that man who read the verse was a
bum. Imagine, honourable senators, a bum

SECOND READING

Han. W. M. Aselline moved the second
reading of Bll S-9, to amend the Criminal
Code.
He saîd: Honourable senators will rerenber that when this bll was read the first
time I gave a brief explanation of it. I now
wish to give a more detailed explanation,
and I am of the opinion that in order to
assist honourable senators who are fot
lawyers I should refer briefiy to certain sections of the Criminal Code itself so that
they will understand just exactly what this
Bill S-9 is being initiated for.
Section 719, 720, 721 and 722 of the Criminal
Code are the sections involved and they have
to do with appeals from summary convictions.
Section 719 says that for the purpose of these
sections an "appeai court"l means
(e) in the provinces of Saskatchewan and Alberta,
the district court of the judicial district or subjudicial district in which the cause of the proceedings arose.
In Alberta there are just two judicial
districts, the northern judicial district and the
southern judicial district and this bil does
not apply to Alberta at ail. But Saskatchewan, by chapter 68 of its Revîsed Statutes,
1953, is divided into 21 judicial districts and
an appeal from a summary conviction would
on that account have to be made ta the
district court of the judicial district of
Saskatoon or the district court of the judiclal
district off Prince Albert and so on as the
case may be.

SENATE
Section 720 of the Criminal Code says:

2, reads as

In the provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan
an appeal under section 720 shall be heard at the
sittings of the appeal court that is held nearest
to the place where the cause of the proceedings
arose.

And section 722 reads:
(1) Where an appeal is taken under section 720,
the appellant shall
(a) prepare a notice of appeal in writing setting
forth-

that he is aggrieved by the conviction, and
so on; and under paragraph (c) of that subsection he must file in the office of the
clerk of the appeal court a notice of appeal
and an affidavit of service.
A year or so ago a commission was appointed in Saskatchewan to investigate the
whole judicial system of the province. That
commission made its report, as a result of
which the Attorney General of Saskatchewan
sponsored a bill to amend the District Courts
Act. The bill was duly passed and is now
chapter 72 of the Statutes of Saskatchewan
for the year 1958. However, it has not yet
been proclaimed. If it were proclaimed in its
present form no proper appeal could be
made so long as the provisions of the Criminal
Code remain as they are, and for this reason,
namely, that that amendment to the District
Courts Act of Saskatchewan does away with
the 21 judicial districts in the province and
replaces them by one judicial district. Section 3 (1) of the amending act reads as
follows:

Hon. Mr. Roebuck: May I ask the honourable senator a question? Where will the
appeal be heard, in one of the 21 judicial
centres or at headquarters?
Hon. Mr. Asel±ine: Subsection 2 of section
721 of the Criminal Code still applies. In
Saskatchewan an appeal under section 720
shall be heard at the appeal court sittings
nearest to the place where the cause of the
proceedings arose. There is no difference in
that respect.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: That would be at
the judicial centre?
Hon. Mr. Aselline: Not necessarily. Saskatchewan still has the judicial districts, for
the amending act has not yet been proclaimed.
If the cause of action arose at, say, Rosetown
the appeal would be to the judicial district of
Kerrobert, in which district Rosetown is
situated.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Is that in accordance
with the wording of the bill? My understanding is that under this legislation there
will be just one judicial district, and the
remaining centres will be known as judicial
centres.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: Yes, and each judicial
centre will have a clerk.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I was just wondering
whether the wording of the Criminal Code,
as it now stands, refers to "judicial centre"?
Hon. Mr. Aselline: No. I will try to clear
that point up.

Honourable senators will note that section
722 of the Criminal Code states that the notice
of appeal and affidavit of service shall be filed
in the office of the clerk of the appeal court,
even though it is addressed to the District
Court for Saskatchewan. The definition of
"clerk" is changed; so that "clerk of the appeal
court" would include the local clerk of the
appeal court, who would be the clerk in the
centre. In effect, there is no change

However, I can't help it. The question before us is, are we going to pass this proposed
amendment to the Criminal Code so that if
the Saskatchewan act is proclaimed a person
will be able to appeal from a summary conviction under which he feels he has suffered
a grievance?
Honourable senators will note that the bill
will not come into effect until it is proclaimed,
and I am quite sure it will not be proclaimed
until the Saskatchewan act has been
proclaimed.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: In that connection,
should we not have some assurance as to
what is going to take place? We are being
asked to pass a bill on the chance that the
province of Saskatchewan will proclaim its
bill. We are to assume that if it proclaims
its bill then our own executive will proclaim
the measure now before us. Before we pass
this bill should we not have a definite understanding from the province that it is going
to proclaim its bill?
Hon. Mr. Aselline: The province of Saskatchewan cannot possibly proclaim its act
unless this amendment goes through. It could
not possibly do that, because if it did no one
would have the right to make a proper appeal.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: And vice versa; the
dominion Government cannot proclaim this
act until the Saskatchewan act is passed.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: That is right.

whereby there will be a fairer division of
work among the judges throughout the
province. I live close enough to Saskatchewan to know what is going on there and I
think we should try to help that province.
Some of the judges are overworked while
others perhaps have not enough to do. I
would be all in favour of helping the Saskatchewan Government make this change if
it wants it. I do not believe it would ask
for legislation if it was not necessary, and as
an outsider all I can say is that according to
stories I have heard coming from that province this legislation is badly needed.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Honourable senators,
I do not see how we can possibly control
the province of Saskatchewan and tell it
we will not do something unless it first announces to us what it is going to do. Surely
all we are asked to do is to put the Criminal
Code into such a position that if and when
the Saskatchewan act is proclaimed as law
we shall have protected the right of the
appellant in Saskatchewan to have the appeal
which he has always had in the past. I see
of no objection whatever to the bill.

Hon. Mr. Roebuck: There are people in

Hon. Mr. Haig: This problem is not confined to Saskatchewan. The same problem
exists in Manitoba and Alberta. The difficulty
is this. Judges have been given jurisdiction
over certain districts but, owing to shifting
of population, some of these districts may
have become too large for one judge and
others perhaps too small, and the provincial
government is trying to work out a system

Hon.. Mr. Aseline: The province asked for
it and even sent its Attorney General down
to Ottawa to hold a conference with the
Minister of Justice.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: I suggested a few
minutes ago that the sponsor of the bill should
have been in a position to assure us that that
was the fact. It helps to know that the province asked for this legislation. The province
would not ask for the legislation if not intending to proclaim its own act.

TO ADDRESS

MEMBERS OF BOTH HOUSES

Hon. W. M. Aseltine: Honourable senators,
before the business of the house is proceeded
with, I would like to make an announcement.
I feel sure you have been pleased to learn
that the Honourable Dr. Kwame Nkrumah,
M.P., Prime Minister of Ghana, has accepted
an invitation extended by the Government to
visit Canada. Dr. Nkrumah's visit will take
place immediately before his visit to the
United States. He will arrive in Ottawa on
Saturday, July 19, and will remain until
Wednesday, July 23.
Honourable senators will also be pleased
to learn that Dr. Nkrumah has consented to
address both Houses of Parliament in the
chamber of the House of Commons on
Monday, July 21, that is next Monday, at
11.00 a.m.
As is usual on such occasions, accommodation will be provided on the floor of the
house for our use during the address, and
I sincerely hope that as many honourable
senators as possible will be in attendance.
At the conclusion of the address of the
Honourable Dr. Kwame Nkrumah, that is at
approximately 11.45 a.m., the Prime Minister
of Canada will escort him to the Railway
Committee Room of the House of Commons
where a reception will be held for him so
that he may meet members of both Houses
of Parliament. The reception is expected
to last until 12.45 p.m.

The Hon. the Speaker informed the Senate
that a message had been received from the
House of Commons with Bill C-29, to implement a convention between Canada and
Belgium for the purpose of extending to the
Belgian Congo and the Territory of RuandaUrundi under Trusteeship the convention

Honourable senators will remember that at
the last session of Parliament I moved the
second reading of a bill which was practically on all fours with this one and which
was passed in this chamber, to amend the
Northwest Territories Act. I believe that at
that time I stated a similar bill to amend
the Yukon Act would be introduced at this
session.

NATIONAL PARKS BILL

The Hon. the Speaker informed the Senate
that a message had been received from the
House of Commons with Bill C-36, to amend
the National Parks Act respecting boundaries
of Cape Breton Highlands National Park.
Bill read first time.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, when shall this bill be read the second
time?
Hon. Felix P. Quinn: At the next sitting of
the house.
Honourable senators, I may say the purpose
of this bill is to convey a portion of the Cape
Breton Highlands National Park to the Nova
Scotia Government for the purpose of hydroelectric power development.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: Could the honourable
senator give us a little information as to what
portion of the park is to be withdrawn?
Hon. Mr. Quinn: At the moment I cannot
describe the exact area, but it is in the
vicinity of Wreck Cove. I will obtain the
information and give it to honourable senators at the next sitting of the Senate.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: The part to be withdrawn from the park covers an area of about
10 square miles.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: But where is it to be
taken out of-the north side, the east side,
the west side or the south side?
Hon. Mr. Brunt: Or from the centre?
Hon. Mr. Quinn: It is on the east side of
the park, the Atlantic Ocean side, in that
vicinity.

MOTION FOR THIRD READING-DEBATE
ADJOURNED

The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators,
when shall this bill be read the third time?
Hon. Mr. Brunt: With leave of the Senate,
I move the third reading of the bill.
Hon. Mr. Power: Honourable senators,Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Honourable senators, we
can proceed to third reading of this bill today
only with consent.
Hon. Mr. Brunt: I asked for consent.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: That is unanimous consent, of course. I am prepared to give my
consent to the motion for third reading today
provided that the debate is not closed. I will
be glad to hear what the honourable senator
from Gulf (Hon. Mr. Power) bas to say, but
I give notice that I intend to move adjournment of the debate on both this bill and the
Loan Companies Bill.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Agreed.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Does the honourable gentleman consent?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: I do, but on the understanding that the debate is adjourned today
and that we do not try to push these things
too far.
Hon. C. G. Power: Honourable senators, I
rise to reiterate the objections which were
made to certain sections of Bill S-11 when it
was before the committee.
The bill contains 13 clauses and a schedule.
As has been said, I think in this chamber and
in the committee, only two or three clauses
are of any importance whatsoever; the others
are coincidental, when they are not absolutely
useless.
The first section to which I would object
is section 10, which gives the proposed new
subsection (3) of section 70 of the act, as
follows:
The aggregate of the sums of money borrowed
and of money entrusted to the company for investment, the repayment of which is guaranteed by

SENATE
the company, shall not exceed twelve and onehaif times the amount of the unimpaired paid-up
capital stock and reserve of the company.

Hon. Mr. Bruni: I believe that in 1950 the
honourable senator sponsored a bill on behalf of the Quebec Savings Banks to do
exactly what this bill proposes to do.

I may say in passing that under the act

JULY 17, 1958
the proceedings in the committee one honourable senator said: "What kind of objection can we have to this bill? The men who
compose these trust companies are honourable and respectable men; they are big businessmen. Let us stop all this arguing and
give them what they want."
Honourable senators, that is simply and
solely the reason for my objection. I have
not said that these men are not honourable
and reputable men, or that they won't make
more money if they get the bill through.
They are reputable men but they will make
more money out of this if they get the bill
through. I am not contesting that at all. I
am just asking in the interests of the ordinary man in Canada what his interest is in
this bill. I have not found out. I have
endeavoured to find out and I thought perhaps my honourable friend would be able to
explain it, but it was not explained in the
evidence given to us before the committee.
Far be it from me to endeavour to bring
into a discussion of this kind a man of the
reputation, character, capacity and intelligence of Mr. MacGregor, the Superintendent
of Insurance. I do not want to make him a
party to this case at all but perhaps I could
say without in any way dragging him into
the argument that it was with great difficulty
we were able to get from him anything like
a very cordial assent to these provisions.
The Superintendent of Insurance has been
appointed by the authorities to be the watchdog of the people of Canada on these institutions. He told us that under section 10
the companies asked for power to borrow
up to 15 times their paid-up capital and that
he would have preferred to have it remain
at 10 times but as a compromise he said

to take sides in the matter, but with respect
to the amortized as against the market value
he said on more than one occasion that he
was market-value conscious rather than amortized-value conscious. I think all those who
attended the committee will agree that that
is what he said.
Hon. Mr. Pouliot: Would the honourable
senator permit me to interrupt to ask a
question?
Hon. Mr. Power: Certainly.
Hon. Mr. Pouliot: For the benefit of the
readers of Hansard who are not familiar with
financial technicalities, would the honourable gentleman tell us what the difference is
between market value and amortized value?
Hon. Mr. Power: I don't understand what it
is from reading the bill but as I understand
it in common, ordinary terms-and please
pardon me if I use that language with reference to the eloquent discourse made by the

honourable gentleman from Hanover (Hon.
Mr. Brunt) when he explained the bill-if a
bond is purchased by one of these companies
to be put in its portfolio at, let us say, $95,
then every year the value of the bond is presumed to increase by a certain arbitrary figure, let us say, 50 cents or $1, so that at
maturity, when the bond is due, it will be
worth $100; and even if the bond goes down
to $50 in the second year it will still be
carried in the company's report for that year,
at $96.
Perhaps I am subject to correction in my
explanation but that is how I understand it,
in simple terms. So that the picture given by
these reports is not the true picture. It is
true that somewhere in its report the company is obliged to give the market value, but
what goes out to the public is not the market
value but the amortized value, which in some
cases may be a great deal lower than the
market value and in other cases might even
be higher. I am not discussing that. The point
I am discussing is that it is not a true picture
of the portfolio which this institution bas, and
that is with respect to the securities which
guarantee the borrowings made by these institutions from the public.
In taking this attitude with respect to corporations, I have on consideration come to the
conclusion that one of the functions of the
Senate is to be prudent and to protect the
rights of property. I could go back to the time
of Confederation and perhaps find there that
one of the reasons for constituting the Senate
and for making provision that senators should
have property qualifications was that the
Fathers of Confederation believed it would be
good for Canada to have a body which would
have a stake in the country-a stake which
is now represented not so much by real estate
as by holdings of stocks and bonds-a body
which would be conscious of property rights.
I think evidence of that is clear in their decision to insist that members of this house
hold real estate. But, unfortunately for me, I
was brought up in a different atmosphere, in
the atmosphere of another chamber where
there was not the same respect for or the
same tradition with regard to property rights.
Perhaps I should not be in this chamber at
all if its function is to protect properties, but
I do not feel it is part of my duty-and I am
not alone in this, though perhaps there are
not too many who agree with me-to act as
a bulwark against the demands of the people
or, as was expressed by some of the Fathers
of Confederation, to act as a bulwark against
universal democracy.
Don't forget that democracy wasn't looked
on with very much favour by the people in
those days. I could quote from the most
respected Fathers of Confederation phrases
in which they decried universal democracy

SENATE
as practised in the United States of America.
I think the institution of the Senate was to
prevent that kind of thing in Canada. This
was a bulwark against democracy. Well, I
cannot share that view. I quite understand
that other members of this house may feel
they are carrying on the traditional function
which they were intended to carry on, but
I do not. I have been too long in the other
section of our Canadian public life to have
that same feeling with respect to property
and financial authority, and when it requests
something I do not feel the request should
be readily granted without our making some
inquiry into whether or not the generality of
the public is to be benefited by it. I therefore
raise these objections to this bill.
Hon. A. Neil McLean: Honourable senators,
with respect to sections 10 and 12 of Bill
S-11, I would simply like to repeat now what
I said in committee when the members divided
on this bill. It has been said that we have
given such powers to chartered banks and
insurance companies. We have an Inspector
General of Banks who is accountable to Parliament; we also have a Superintendent of
Insurance, who was before us in committee
yesterday, who is accountable to Parliament
and protects us in a good way. The trust
companies and loan companies, large and
small, all over the country, assume the same
powers as the banks without proper supervision, so what control have we? I do not
think I can remember a time since the hungry
thirties when we had such a poor bond market
as today. Bonds are dropping steadily, and
they are going to drop further. In my humble
opinion, an 8 per cent margin is too low.
We have seen bonds drop four or five points
in one day, and provincial bonds which were
bought at par are down to nearly 80. There
is no provision for reserve.
Now, as far as amortized values go, it is
certainly not sound. The federal Department
of Insurance has always opposed such a
policy, because it means a false balance
sheet as far as values are concerned, and
there is no way out of it. The general public
get a statement and look at what the bonds
are worth. They do not understand amortized
value any more than the senator who just
spoke does or than I do. Now, if a small company goes into liquidation, all that the liquidators get is what the bonds are actually worth,
and the amortized value goes out the window.
If they find a buyer and sell out, the buyer
only pays exactly what the bonds are worth
on the market; they will not pay the amortized
value at all. The market value is all that will
be receved.
Honourable senators, I think the general
public should be protected. We are told that
the purpose of the Senate is to represent the

general public of Canada, but I do not think
we are protecting the general public if we
allow 'balance sheets to go out which are
false. A company's assets should be shown
on its balance sheet at their true market
value, not a false value.
Hon. Calvert C. Prait: Honourable senators, as a member of the committee which
has been referred to, I should like to acknowledge that I am probably the one whom the
honourable senator referred to a moment ago
as having said that as the clause in question
had been agreed to between the trust companies and the overseeing officials of Government it might remain as it is. In that connection I was referring to one item only,
which is the method of valuation in the
annual statement, and that is a matter of
procedure. Any businessman who would take
such a statement without examination and
without breaking down the basis of value
and judging the relative amortized value as
compared with the market value would not
know very much about what he was doing.
The point is that the amortized value has
relation to what was paid for a security, the
period it will be outstanding and what it will
eventually be worth when it matures.
As I stated in committee, I think a great
many irrelevant issues have been introduced
concerning those two terms of value as applying to this bill. It has been argued that the
official valuation in the annual statement
should be the current market value. It would
be entirely deceptive to appraise the financial
position of a company throughout the year
just on the basis of the market values of its
assets at the date of its annual report. Perhaps within one month, or even within a
week, something might happen in the security
markets that would change the situation very
much. We have been discussing really a
matter of procedure. As a matter of fact, it
is the practice, as we know, for business
organizations which submit their investments
for public or official scrutiny to submit a
schedule of market values as well. It does
not make sense to submit an annual statement to the department on the basis of the
value of securities on one particular day of
the year, and to expect that from that statement the policy of a particular trust company, or whatever company it is, is to be
judged for a whole year. The point is that
when men who are heads of important trust
companies with tremendous responsibilities,
and officials of a department of the Government whose duty it is to appraise the companies' actions and procedure, agree on
certain methods of recording values as being
correct, we are only making a mountain out
of a molehill to say their methods are deceptive and might lead people astray.

JULY 17, 1958
Hon. Mr. Bruni: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Pratt: Nothing could be more
deceptive than to submit an annual statement which possibly represents all types of
securities and to show only how they stand
in value on a certain day of a year. Nothing
could be more misleading than to have the
annual recorded values which just reflect
market values at one date in the year. That
is why I think the amortized plan which is
related to both the cost and ultimate returns
is the proper one to use in this case.
Hon. Mr. Isnor: Would the honourable
senator be good enough to allow a question?
Hon. Mr. Pratt: Yes.
Hon. Mr. Isnor: In connection with the
market value, what is the position of a bank
when a merchant, say, enters the bank and
makes application for a loan on a security?
Does the bank take the market value or some
other value at that particular date?
Hon. Mr. Pratt: I do not think that has any
application at all.
Hon. Mr. Isnor: Oh, yes, I think it has.
Hon. Mr. Pratt: We are now discussing the
appraisal of the value of trust companies.
Hon. Mr. Isnor: It is the same principle.
Hon. Mr. Pratt: If what my honourable
friend inquires about is a specific loan against
one specific security, then the value of that
security at the date of application for the
loan would naturally be taken into account.
But to answer the honourable gentleman's
question, I cannot imagine any institution
taking a share certificate at any time of the
year and saying it is going to loan money
on that particular certificate simply because
the value at a certain time-at the end of
last December, or at the end of last Marchwas such and such. The question I do not
regard as very relevant to the case under
review. If, however, the amortized value is
taken, that eventually becomes the actual
value at some time.
Hon. Mr. McLean: Honourable senators,
may I make a correction for the honourable
senator from St. John's West (Hon. Mr.
Pratt)? Yesterday I asked a question of the
Superintendent of Insurance and he told us
that his department had always opposed
amortized values and they were not recommended by his department.
Hon. Mr. Prait: I did not understand that
at all.
Hon. Gordon B. Isnor: Honourable senators,
I have not a great deal to say in regard to
this bill. The ground has been pretty well
covered by the honourable gentleman who

first raised objection to sections 10 and 12.
I am not strongly opposed to section 12,
although I think trust companies are put in a
somewhat different position from the ordinary
businessman who takes a list of securities into
the bank to make application for a loan.
Naturally they look down the list and then
compare the market value at that particular
date when the application for loan is being
made, and it is from the market value at
that date they determine whether the loan is
worth consideration and how much the loan
will be. If a particular bond has dropped
from 100 to 85, and the bank is going to loan
75 per cent of the original price, it will take
75 per cent of the 85, which lowers the value
in dollars and cents of the loan. That is
all I have to say about section 12.
I want to support the honourable senator
in regard to section 10. There bas been a
steady increase in the amount of the borrowing power of trust companies, starting off, if
I remember correctly, in 1914 at five times the
amount of the paid-up capital. A few years
later it was increased from five to seven times,
which meant an increase of, roughly speaking, 40 per cent. Then a few years later it
was increased from seven to ten, which
meant another 45 per cent increase. Now the
trust companies give as their reason for asking
for an increase from ten to twelve and onehalf times the amount of the paid-up capital,
that the life insurance companies and the
banks have this power.
It would appear to me that we are placing
too much money on the market at the present
time.
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): Does
the honourable gentleman think the measure
is inflationary?
Hon. Mr. Isnor: It could be taken that
way but I am not prepared to say it is. I
am not an authority in that respect. However, I do know that if you increase the
amount of money a company may borrow
from ten to twelve and one-half times the
amount of its unimpaired paid up capital
stock and reserve, you are running into many
millions of dollars and it is bound to have
its effect on the market. That is about as
fair an answer as I can give in respect to
your question.
Hon. Mr. Bruni: Surely the honourable
senator does not think this particular section
is going to create any new money?
Hon. Mr. Isnor: I said I did not know
what effect it would have on the market,
but I do know, and I repeat for the benefit
of the senator who asked the last question,
that you cannot put additional millions of
dollars on the market without their having
some effect. And that is what you are doing

SENATE
by this bill, which gives these companies the
opportunity of increasing their borrowing
powers from ten times to twelve and one-half
times the amount of their unimpaired capital
stock and reserve. I am inclined to think,
honourable senators, that it will have some
effect on our financial condition and the
economy of the country as a whole. I hesitate
to agree that this is a good time to increase
the borrowing powers of trust companies,
notwithstanding the fact that I have a great
deal of respect, as I feel all honourable senators have, for the place which trust companies occupy in the economy of our country.
For that reason I hesitate to give full
approval to the bill as it now stands.
There is another reason. Like the honourable senator who raised this question I have
always thought that I represented the man
on the street, if you wish. Perhaps I am
out of the moneyed class, but I do feel that
the other side should have been given an
opportunity. We heard one side only of this
question, we heard from those asking for
this increased power, and I think perhaps
we should have stressed the point to a greater
extent than we did in committee and in the
Senate today that there should be an advertised public hearing so that all could have
the opportunity of making representations.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: That is right.

Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Honourable senators,
I might explain that this is a very minor
technical amendment to one legal phrase in
one section of the bill.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, when shall this amendment be concurred
in?
Hon. Mr. Brunt: Honourable senators, with

Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Honourable senators,
it seems to me we do not need to repeat now
the debate to which we have just listened.
This bill is exactly the same as the preceding
bill, and I would suggest that the honourable
senator ask that it be placed on the Order
Paper for third reading at the next sitting.
Then it could be taken up at the conclusion
of the debate that was initiated this afternoon.

The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, when shall this report be considered?
Hon. Mr. Pearson: I would move that the
report be adopted this afternoon, if that is
agreeable.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: May I ask the honourable senator who presented the report if it
is the intention of the committee to sit at
places other than Ottawa?
Hon. Mr. Pearson: That is the general idea.
There is a possibility that we might have
to sit elsewhere. We have no definite arrangements, but if that contingency were to corne
up we want to have power to sit at some
other place besides Ottawa.

JULY 17, 1958
Han. Mr. Macdonald: It seems to me that
before approving of this report the house
should have some idea as to where the committee proposes to sit. I would prefer that the
chairman allow consideration of the report to
stand over until a number of us have had
an opportunity of considering it.
Hon. Mr. Pearson: That is satisfactory. I
will move adoption at the next sitting.

SUGGESTED APPOINTMENT 0F MR. JOHN
BRACKEN TO PRIVY COUNCIL

While 1 arn on my feet I have a suggestion to make to the Government. In the
past I was not very successful with my
suggestion that the Government should have
printed a million copies of the beautiful
address broadcast by Her Majesty the Queen
on the occasion of her visit here, in order
to distribute it to the school chihdren of
Canada through the provincial authorities.
Nothing was done. I have also suggested that
ail provincial Prime Ministers should be appointed to the Privy Council. There again
I was not successful. But I have another
suggestion to make which I hope the Government will consider favourably. Some years
ago, for the first time that such a thing was
done in the history of Canada, the Honourable George Drew, Q.C., then national leader
of the Conservative Party, was appointed to
the Privy Council by the Liberal Government
of the Right Honourable Louis St. Laurent.
I wonder if the Acting Leader of the Government will convey to the Prime Minister my
suggestion that the only surviving national
leader of the Conservative party who is not
a Privy Councillor, Mr. John Bracken, should
be appointed to the Privy Council.
Hon. Mr. Manette: I will bring the inquiry
of the honourable senator to the attention
of the Leader of the Government.

Average income: Based upon official estimates of the number of fishermen in Canada
and the total landed value, the average gross
income per fisherman ranged from $1,137 in
1952 to $1,425 in 1956. It is generally assumed
that current expenses of fishermen (excluding mortgage payments and interest on investment) are usually about one-third of gross
receipts. On this basis the average net income
of fishermen in Canada varied from $757 in
1952 to $949 in 1956.
It should be remembered, however, that
there are a large number of part-time fishermen earning a very small proportion of their
income from fishing and that the net income
per man-year varies from an average of $250
for a shareman in the small-boat fisheries of
Newfoundland and Quebec to an average of
$5,000 for a skipper on an Atlantic coast
dragger or Pacific coast purse-seiner.

SENATE
LAKE OF THE WOODS CONTROL BOARD
BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. Gunnar S. Thorvaldson moved the
second reading of Bill C-25, to amend the
Lake of the Woods Control Board Act, 1921.
He said: Honourable senators, I am sure
that if you had beffore you a map of the Lake
of the Woods watershed you would be in a
much better position to follow the explanation which I wish to make in regard to this
bill.
The Lake of the Woods Control Board Act
of 1921 established the Lake of the Woods
Control Board. The purpose of the Board
was to regulate the storage in and outflow
from the Lake of the Woods. At that time
the natural resources of Manitoba were
administered by the Government of Canada,
which also had an interest in the navigation
and international aspects of the Lake of the
Woods storage. The board, as established,
consisted of two members for Canada and
two members for Ontario. In 1930 administration of the natural resources of Manitoba
was transferred to the Government of that
province, but the significance to Canada of
the international and navigation features of
this storage has continued and will do so in
the foreseeable future. The international
feature continues to be of primary importance to the Government of Canada, which
has obligations under the Lake of the Woods
Treaty of 1925 for regulation of Lake of the
Woods levels within carefully defined limits.
That, of course, was a treaty between Canada
and the United States.
The navigation feature has become secondary in importance, as navigation on the lake
is limited to tugs and other relatively small
commercial and pleasure craft. The storage
in the Lake of the Woods has continued to
increase in importance to the province of
Manitoba, which has developed for power
production almost the entire reach of the
Winnipeg River in Manitoba downstream
from the Lake of the Woods. I might say
that development consists of approximately
850,000 horsepower, which has been developed on the Winnipeg River throughout the
years by the Province of Manitoba.
In 1928 the responsibility for regulation of
storage in and outflow from Lac Seul on the
English River was assigned to this board by
provincial and federal concurrent legislation,
namely, the Lac Seul Conservation Act, 1928.
Lac Seul is located, generally speaking, to
the northeast of what we refer to as the Lake
of the Woods area.
In 1957 the Hydro-Electric Power Commission of Ontario constructed works to
divert water from Lake St. Joseph in the

upper Albany River basin to Lac Seul, via
the Root River. I might point out that the
St. Joseph basin is located to the northeast
of the Lake of the Woods area and the Lac
Seul area, and it empties into the Hudson
Bay via the Albany River, or, at least, it did
so naturally. In order that the board may
continue to regulate effectively the storage in
and outflow from Lac Seul, it is necessary
that the act be amended to give the board
authority to regulate the operation of the
Lake St. Joseph diversion works when the
level of Lac Seul rises above certain fixed
elevations during particular months of the
year.
I might mention here that certain diversion
works were created for the purpose of having
the waters of Lake St. Joseph flow into Lac
Seul, and eventually through the Winnipeg
River, instead of through the Albany River
to James Bay. Those arrangements, of
course, were all made between the two Governments of Manitoba and Ontario.
Storage in the Lake of the Woods and Lac
Seul provides water essential to the generation of hydro-electric power on the Winnipeg
and English Rivers in northwestern Ontario
and on the Winnipeg River in southeastern
Manitoba. This river system supplies a very
substantial portion of the electric power requirements of these areas for the extensive
mineral and timber industries in Ontariothose Ontario developments are on the English River-and the bulk of the industries
and population of Manitoba, particularly the
city of Winnipeg and vicinity. Those are the
developments on the Winnipeg River that
are referred to.
The additional water made available by
diversion from Lake St. Joseph is of substantial value both to Ontario and to Manitoba in the provision of a greater amount of
hydro-electric power. Ontario and Manitoba
have agreed upon the division of power
generated from the diverted waters and have
interconnected their transmission networks
for most effective operation.
This changing pattern of storage use makes
it most desirable that Manitoba have official
representation on the Lake of the Woods
Control Board, which necessitates the amendment of section 2 of the act to alter the
board membership by the replacement of one
of the two representatives for Canada by one
representative for Manitoba, with Ontario
continuing to have two representatives.
I want to explain here that since 1921
Manitoba has not had official representation
on this board. The board has consisted of
four members, two appointed by the province of Ontario and two appointed by the
Government of Canada. However, to satisfy
Manitoba, that province has had what is

JULY 22, 1958
referred to as unofficial representation on
this board, and indeed I think it may be said
that no action has been taken by this board
throughout all these years which was not
approved by the Government of Manitoba
through its unofficial representative on this
board. The location of all of the reservoirs
in Ontario makes this proportion of membership most appropriate, namely, that
Ontario should have two members, Manitoba
one, and the Government of Canada one.
The amendment required in section 3(b)
(b) of the act will give the board authority
over the Lake St. Joseph diversion works.
This is really the second part of the act.
The first part deals with the membership on
the control board, and the second part deals
with the diversion works that I refer to,
namely, that the act will give the board
authority over the Lake St. Joseph diversion
works when Lac Seul is above certain fixed
elevations during particular months of the
year and so will permit the board to regulate
storage in and outflow from Lac Seul in the
best interests of both provinces.
The other amendments required in the act
cover minor changes necessitated by the
amendment of section 2, which is the amendment regarding the change of membership on
the board.
If any honourable senator desires to ask
questions in regard to this matter further, I
shall try to answer them as best I can.
Hon. Mr. Croll: Is it the intention of the
sponsor to have this bill sent to a committee?
Hon. Mr. Thorvaldson: At the moment I
feel it would perhaps not be necessary for
the bill to go to committee. However, if any
honourable senator desires that it go to committee, I have no objection; and if there is
a reference it should perhaps be to the
Committee on Natural Resources.
Hon. Mr. Croll: I suggest that the honourable senator see that it be sent to a committee.
Hon. Mr. Thorvaldson: That will be quite
satisfactory. If it is so desired, I shall recommend that the bill be sent to committee.
Hon. William M. Wall: Honourable senators,
I am pleased to have this opportunity to make
a few supplementary and I trust helpful observations concerning this legislation which is
intended to make substantial amendments to
the statute, originally passed in 1921, setting
up the Lake of the Woods Control Board.
The task of intervening in the discussion
of this bill is made a little more difficult
because of the comprehensiveness, lucidity,
and excellence of the explanation which we
have just heard from our colleague from Winnipeg South (Hon. Mr. Thorvaldson).

I would feel remiss if I did not express my
support of the two key principles involved in
legislative amendments which give statutory
validation to important co-operative developments between Manitoba and Ontario in the
field of water regulation and control, especially in the field of integrated development
of our power resources on the English and
Winnipeg Rivers.
I recognize that the new provisions are
straightforward and basically non-controversial. I know that they have already been
approved by concurrent, enabling legislation
passed in 1958 by the Province of Ontario,
Bills 141 and 144, and by the Province of
Manitoba, Bill 45.
I hope the bill before us will be sent to
committee for further review of its specific
and technical details. May I add one or two
queries here and there so that the honourable
senator may keep them in mind and have
them answered perhaps in committee.
The substantive amendments show the dual
purpose of the bill. One of these purposes is
to provide for the control of waters through
the Lake St. Joseph diversion-as set out on
page 2 of the bill, in the new paragraph (c) of
section 3 of the act-to regulate and control
the flow of waters only if the waters diverted
into Lac Seul from Lake St. Joseph might be
too abundant, and therefore there is a limitation as to the duty of the board provided the
level of Lac Seul rises above certain lake
levels.
The second purpose of the bill is to provide
for membership on the board for the Province
of Manitoba. Throughout the bill you notice
the phrase, "The Lieutenant Governor of
Manitoba in Council", and you will notice too
that only five of the sections of the original
act of 1921 are being changed, namely, sections
2, 3, 5, 9 and 10; and not being changed are
sections 4, 6, 7 and 8.
I think it would be fair at this stage of the
discussion to pay tribute to the board, which
has done an excellent job within the framework of its assigned duties and competencies.
It is a tribute to the high level of technical
competency and responsible co-operative
endeavour.
I should like to comment first on section
2 of the bill, which is straightforward and
which I support. Here the board gets the
needed statutory authority to control the
amount of water coming into Lac Seul from
the diversion of Lac St. Joseph. It is a fascinating development and it would be very
interesting to discuss some of the features
of that diversion. It adds almost 5,000 square
miles to the watershed and I think increases
the horsepower potential of the English River
and the Winnipeg River by close to 500 million k.w.h. per year.

SENATE
The second main purpose of the amending
bill concerns changes in the technical and
engineering personnel representation on the
board, and to that I would like to add my
comment. Stated simply, the number continues to remain at four, and instead of two
representatives from Ontario and two representatives of the federal Government, we
are now to have two representatives from
Ontario, one from the federal Government
and one from Manitoba. In other words, the
federal Government loses one member and
Manitoba gains one. This gain should probably
have been made back in 1930, when the
natural resources passed into the hands of
Manitoba.
Interestingly too, you will notice that the
bill provides for the first time a statutory
way of having alternate representatives on
the board.
This statutory provision for a Manitoba
representative must be assessed in the context of historical practice to which the honourable senator from Winnipeg South (Hon.
Mr. Thorvaldson) has referred, and that is
that since 1930 Manitoba has had a kind
of unofficial associate representative; and
what is to Manitoba's credit, I am told, is
that Manitoba has shared in meeting the
costs of the board's operation.
Now, although I recognize that Manitoba
has agreed to the membership of four, distributed as explained, I do wish to bring to
the attention of honourable senators the
criteria advanced for this distribution of
representation. On page 2066 of the House
of Commons Hansard for this session, there
occurs this phrase:
The location of all the reservoirs in Ontario makes
this proportioned membership rnost appropriate . . .

drainage and power interests calls for equal
representation from Manitoba and Ontario.

How? There may be two each, with one
representative of the federal Government to
serve on the International Lake of the Woods
Control Board to meet the international obligations, navigational and so on mentioned by
the honourable senator from Winnipeg South,
which date back to the protocol and agreement of 1925.
So I venture to suggest even at this late
stage that in committee we might be given
information concerning the projected distribution of board membership and told
whether Manitoba had asked for additional
rights of representation.
Before I close I would like to point out
that the Manitoba Bill, on page 3, section 3,
paragraph 5() states, as ours does, that the
board has the powers necessary for effectively carrying out the duties vested in it
by this act or by the act passed by the
Legislatures of the provinces of Ontario and
Manitoba. This is substituted for the present
section 5, which reads: "The said board
shall have. . .". The Ontario legislation also
uses the words "shall have". Now the query
that bothers me is: Does this declaration
that the board has the powers, which is an
assertion, instead of the words "shall have"
as in the Ontario version and in our present
act, enable the board as validly to exercise
those powers?
Thon also on page 3, section 5 of the bill,
paragraph 10, there is a provision as follows:
The Governor General in Council may, with the
concurrence of the Lieutenant Governor of Ontario
in Council and the Lieutenant Governor of Manitoba
in Council, make regulations-

The Manitoba Act differs a little in terminology, and I confess that I do not know the
implications of that difference, but I would
like to have it explained in committee. The
Manitoba Act provides that for the purpose

Hon. Norman P. Lambert: Honourable
senators, before this bill is read a second
time, may I say that anyone who is familiar
with the Lake of the Woods and its relation
to International Falls knows that this matter
has been the subject of discussion in the

JULY 22, 1958
past before the International Joint Commission. May I, therefore, ask the sponsor of
the bill whether this legislation in any way
impinges upon the relations between Canada
and the United States as determined by the
International Joint Commission? The question of the levels of the Lake of the Woods,
which are carefully taken and recorded
periodically, allegedly to the satisfaction of
all concerned, is an important one. The
moment the level of that lake lowers, experience of the past tells us that we hear
promply about it from certain quarters at
International Falls.
Has this legislation any effect at all upon
the relations between the two countries as
determined by the International Joint Commission?
Hon. Mr. Thorvaldson: Honourable senators,
in reply to the question asked by the honourable senator, may I say I am informed that
this legislation in no way impinges on the
work of the International Board. That board,
as honourable senators know, consists of two
representatives, one appointed by the Government of Canada and the other appointed
by the Government of the United States.
The International Board has jurisdiction in
regard to two aspects of the Lake of the
Woods system: one is the navigational aspect
which, as I indicated in my previous remarks,
is of comparatively small importance by virtue
of the fact that navigation on this waterway
is largely by small tugs and not by large
vessels. The other aspect is that of lake levels.
Whenever the lake level goes down to a
certain point, measured in feet, the International Board derives power to act in regard
to that situation. As I said a moment ago,
this legislation would not affect the function
of that international body in any way.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: May I suggest to my
honourable friend, who has undertaken to
refer this bill to the appropriate committee,
that he consider calling officials from the
International Joint Commission as witnesses
to deal with this particular point. I would
further suggest that adequate maps showing
the actual location of these bodies of water
be made available for the benefit of those
honourable senators who have not been as
fortunate as my honourable friend from Winnipeg South, and perhaps some of the rest
of us, who have enjoyed visiting that lake
in the summer time. I am sure some information on the geography of the area would be
enlightening to the committee.
Hon. Mr. Thorvaldson: I will see that both
those matters are looked after when the bill
reaches committee.

Hon. Mr. Burchill: Honourable senators,
may I ask a question? Is the chairman of
the board appointed by the board itself or
by one of the governments?
Hon. Mr. Thorvaldson: I am sorry that I
cannot answer that question at the moment.
I think he is appointed by the board, but
I am not certain.
Motion agreed to and bill read second time.
REFERRED TO COMMITTEE
On motion of Hon. Mr. Thorvaldson, bill
referred to Standing Committee on Natural
Resources.
YUKON BILL
SECOND READING
Hon. Gunnar S. Thorvaldson moved the
second reading of Bill C-35, to amend the
Yukon Act.
He said: Honourable senators, the objects of
the present bill are to improve the financial
administration of the Yukon Territory and
to facilitate the administration of justice.
There is also a minor matter relating to liquor
administration in the Territory.
Referring first to section 1 of the bill, the
purpose of the new section 19(1) is to broaden
the purposes for which the Commissioner in
Council may borrow or lend money, and to
authorize the investment of surplus money
standing to the credit of the Yukon Consolitated Revenue Fund.
Perhaps I should explain briefly that the
Yukon Act, which is Chapter 53 of the Revised
Statutes of Canada 1952-53, sets up a commission to govern the Yukon Territory. That
commission
consists of a commissioner
appointed by the Canadian Government, and
four other commissioners elected by the public
of the Territory.
The Yukon Act, as it now stands, authorizes
the territorial Government to borrow money
for the purpose of (a) meeting annual expenditures of the territory pending receipt of
annual territorial revenues, or (b) lending
money to municipalities, for the construction
of roads, waterworks, sewers, or other municipal works.
In the past it has usually been possible
for the Territory to meet capital commitments
from current revenues, which are now running at about $2 million a year. On at least
two occasions, however, it has been necessary
for Parliament, through an appropriation act,
to grant specific authority to the Territorial
Government of the Yukon to borrow money
for major capital projects which could not
be financed out of annual revenues. It is
anticipated that in the next few years the
Territory will be required to borrow further

SENATE
sums on a long-term basis to meet its capital
requirements. The new section will enable

the territorial Government to do this without
requiring the specific authority of Parliament
in each instance.
In order to help give honourable senators
a better understanding of the matters involved
in this bill, I might interpolate here that
the population of the Yukon, according to the
1956 census, was slightly over 12,000 persons.
So when we are dealing with the Yukon
Territory we are dealing with a large land
area and with a very small population.
The present section 19(1) limits the lending
power of the territorial Government to the
lending of money to municipalities. The new
section broadens this power to include the
lending of money to school districts. At the
present time no school districts have been
established within the Territory but it is
hoped that eventually such districts will be
established. The experience in the administration of the Northwest Territories, where there
are two school districts in existence now, is
that the territorial Government is sometimes
called upon to help the district finance major
school construction projects through long-term
loans.
Hon. Mr. Pouliot: Would the honourable
gentleman permit me to interrupt to ask a
question?
Hon. Mr. Thorvaldson: Yes.
Hon. Mr. Pouliot: Where does the Yukon
Territory derive its revenue from, and what
is the approximate amount?
Hon. Mr. Thorvaldson: The revenue of the
Yukon is approximately $2 million and is
derived very much from the same sources
as are revenues of the provinces. Indeed, the
Yukon Act, which I referred to at the beginning, gives the Yukon Territorial Council
approximately the same powers as the provinces have under section 92 of the British
North America Act. If the honourable gentleman wants to know exactly where the
revenues are derived from I think I am able
to give him that information right now.
Hon. Mr. Croll: It may be seen on page
2291 of the Hansard of the House of Commons.
Hon. Mr. Thorvaldson: Yes. I take this
itemization of revenues from page 2291 of
the House of Commons Hansard, which discloses that the revenues for 1956-57 totalled
$2.1 million. They came from the following
sources:

seems apparent, honourable senators, that
is a good thing there is no prohibition
the Yukon, otherwise the Government
the Territory would be bankrupt.
Still another purpose of the new section
19(1) is to enable the territorial Government
to invest money standing to its credit in
the Yukon Consolidated Revenue Fund which
is surplus to immediate requirements. From
time to time the Territory holds funds in
reserve for specific purposes, such as for
the replacement of road maintenance and
construction
equipment, and Workmen's
Compensation funds. It would be to the
financial advantage of the Territory if this
money could be invested.
Subsection (2) of section 1 of the bill deals
with section 19(3) of the act. The old subsection (3) required the approval of the
Governor in Council before the Territory
might borrow or lend money. The proposal
contained in the new subsection is that
authority of the Governor in Council be
required before the Territory may borrow or
invest funds, but that no such restriction
be placed on the lending of money by the
Council. The purpose of this provision is
to ensure that territorial indebtedness is kept
within safe and reasonable limits, and to
ensure that investments are sound. It is
not considered that approval is necessary for
the lending of money, because section 19(1)
limits the power of the Territorial Government to lending money to municipalities and
school districts, both of which are creatures
of the Territorial Council, and, as such, subject to control by the Council.
Honourable senators, I will turn now to
the second section of the bill. The new
subsection (3) which is being added to section
36 will permit the Governor in Council to
appoint deputy police magistrates for the
Territory. This provision has been inserted
on the recommendation of the Minister of
Justice, who is responsible for the administration of justice in the Territory. Subsection (1)
of section 36 now provides for the appointment of police magistrates and subsection
(2) requires such magistrates to reside in
the Territory and to refrain from practising
as barristers and solicitors.

JULY 22, 1958
A similar amendment was contained ini the
bill ta amend the Northwest Territories Act,
approved by the last Parliament, and the need
for this provision is the same in the Yukon.
There is at present only one police magistrate
in the entire Territory and he resides in
Whitehorse where the Territorial Court is
located. There is no one ta carry on bis
work should he be Ml or absent on leave
and, in view of the small number af practising barristers and solicitors in the Territory,
it may not always be possible ta find a
resident who is in a position ta act. The
Government, therefore, considers that in
the interest af prompt and efficient administration of justice, it is desirable that
there be authority for the appointment af a
qualified lawyer from. one af the provinces
who cauld be sent into the Territory as
deputy police magistrate on a temporary
basis.
The purpose af section 3 of the bilHon. John J. Connolly (Ottawa West):
Before the honourable gentleman leaves section 2, may I ask if that section precludes the
appointment of a barrister who is practising
ini the Yukon fromn being appointed as a
deputy magistrate? M*ust these people came
f rom the provinces?
Hon. Mr. Thorvaldson: I believe that the
Department af Justice has at least given its
opinion in that matter ta the effect that a
deputy magistrate may be a resident ai the
Yukon. The section reads as iollows:
The Governor li Council may appoint one or more
persans who are barristers or advocates of at lest
three years' standing at the bar of any of the
provinces of Canada-

Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): Does that
include the Yukon?
Hon. Mr. Thorvaldson: I understand that
the Interpretation Act provides that the Yukon
Territory, for the purposes af the act, is a
province. 1 believe it is for that reason that
the Department of Justice suggests that an
appointmnent can be made from the Yukon
and that no amendment is necessary for that
purpose.
Hon. Mr. Pouliot: What is the salary ai the
Commissioner?
Hon. Mr. Thorvaldson: I do not know; but
as I mentianed a moment ago there is anly
one resident magistrate in the Yukon now.
Honourable senators, as I was about ta say,
the purpose af section 3 af the bull is simply
ta make it clear that the Governor in Cauncil
may appoint judicial as well as administrative officers, as stated in the explanatory notes
ai the bill. The particular judicial officers we
have in mind are the presiding officers ai
small debt tribunals established pursuant ta
the Judicature Ordinance. Paragraph (i) of
57075-4-23

section 16 af the act authorizes the Commissioner in Council ta legislate in respect ta
certain inatters relating ta the administration
ai justice in the Territory but specifically
excludes the power ta appoint judicial officers
ather than coroners. It is the intention that
all judicial officers, other than coroners, be
appainted by the Governor in Councfl.
Section 4 deals with the importation ai
liquor into the Territory. Honourable senatars
will recagnize that from. a taxing point af
view, at least, this is a matter ai great importance, although tis amendment is referred
ta here as a very minor one.
Subsection (1) ai section 47 ai the act
prohibits anyone from bringing liquor into
the Territory unless he has the permission
ai the Commissioner. The Importation ai
Intaxicating Liquors Act prohibits the shipment ai intoxicating liquors into a province
except Io the provincial Government or
provincial liquor board or commission. We,
therefore, now have two federal enactments
governing the importation ai liquor into the
Territory, and it is praposed ta eliminate the
application af one ai them. It is also proposed
that the Commissianer should be empowered
ta authorize same one ta act on his behalf
in these matters.
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): Is the
prohibition against bringing liquor into the
Territory for sale, or is it just against bringing it in?
Hlon. Mr. Thorvaldson: I believe the
prohibition is against bringing it in.
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): In other
words, persans bringing in liquor in their
baggage would be off ending against tis
section?
Hon. Mr. Thorvadmon: I think that applies
throughout Canada, does it nat? I know it
is illegal for me ta buy whisky in Kenora
and take it across the barder into Manitoba.
I believe there is similar law in every
province, s0 notbing new is proposed here.
Section 5 ai the bill, the final section,
deals with tbe legal description ai the
baundaries of the Yukon Territory. The
present description was written bei are the
country was accurately mapped and recent
surveys have indicated that one small change
is necessary.
This involves the mast
southerly portion af the boundary between
the Yukon Territary and the Nartbwest Territaries, which at present is described ta be
the line ai the watershed separating certain
streams. It has been iound that in respect
ta the sauthemnmost 10 or 12 miles the watershed is flot; wbere it was tbought ta be, and
thereiare a straight line bas been surveyed
ta clearly define the baundary in this area.

remarks I hope I have been able to clarify

bill.

PARKS

BILL

SECOND READING

Hon. Felix P. Quinn moved the second
reading of Bill C-36, to amend the National
Parks Act respecting the boundaries of Cape
Breton Highlands National Park.
He said: Honourable senators, I suppose
you will wonder why I am sponsoring a
bill having to do with Cape Breton. There
is a very good reason, namely, that there
is no representative in this Senate from
that part of my province, and I am sorry
that condition has existed since the passing
of our late colleague Senator MacLennan,
from Margaree Forks, some five years ago.
I am informed, however, an appointment
is about to be made, with which I hope all
honourable senators will be satisfied, and
then Nova Scotia will have its full representation. The reason I have been asked
to sponsor this bill is that I am the sole
Conservative from Nova Scotia in this
chamber. This reminds me that recently
our friend the senior senator from Winnipeg
(Hon. Mr. Haig) claimed the distinction of
being the only survivor of the Conservative
members in the Manitoba Legislature of
forty-three years ago. Not to be outdone,
our friend from Vancouver South (Hon. Mr.
Farris) claimed that he was the sole survivor of the first Liberal Government of
British Columbia. Now we have two of our
members in the Senate Hall of Fame, and
I am going to make a claim to be the third
one, for I had the distinction a year ago
of being the only surviving Conservative
senator in all the six provinces east of
Manitoba.
Having finished with that nonsense, I shall
proceed with my explanation of the bill.
Hon. Mr. Pouliot: If my honourable friend
permits me I would like to ask him a
question. In the description of the land to
be deleted from the park mention is made
of an iron post marked "W" and seven
wooden posts, and besides that the other

limits are indicated by points. What I want
to know is, will the Canadian Government
build a fence around or alongside that
property, or will it leave the posts, iron
and wooden, as boundary marks?
Hon. Mr. Quinn: Do you mean of the
whole park or the part to be deleted?
Hon. Mr. Poulio: That property which is
described in the schedule.
Hon. Mr. Quinn: I cannot answer that.
After my explanation I am going to move
that this bill be referred to committee, and
if my honourable friend will come to the
committee he will obtain the information
he wants.
Honourable senators will notice that the
schedule consists of a little more than two
pages. I am not going to weary the house
by reading all of that description.
I may tell my honourable friend from
Churchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar) that I was wrong
when I answered his question the other day
as to the location of this part of the park.
I said that I thought it was on the east side,
but it is in the southerly section, near Lake
Cheticamp. Wreck Cove is on the east coast,
and that is where the hydro-electric development will be. If rny honourable friend would
like to see a map of the area I will send it
over, and he will note the boundary of the
area is marked in blue.
In November 1956 the Nova Scotia Power
Commission requested authority to undertake
a survey of certain lands in the southern
portion of the Cape Breton Highlands National
Park to obtain data on the watershed area
surrounding Lake Cheticamp. This information
was required in planning the Wreck Cove
hydro-electric development which would be
constructed in an area adjacent to but outside
the boundaries of the park.
As there was no authority under the
National Parks Act for such a survey to be
carried out by a private individual, company
or commission, authority was given by the
Treasury Board on January 4, 1957, for the
Minister of Northern Affairs and National
Resources to enter into an agreement with the
Nova Scotia Power Commission to carry out
the survey as a public undertaking.
The agreement in effect provided that if,
as a result of the survey, it became apparent
that the proposed development would benefit
substantially by the use of waters flowing
from the park, and if the Government of
Canada decided it was in the public interest
to delete the affected area from the park so
that the waters could be used, the cost of the
survey would be borne by the Nova Scotia
Power Commission.

SENATE
Cape Breton Island was selected for the
national park. It is a beautiful area, any
way you wish to look at it.
I am pleased that this bill is to be sent to
a committee, because I think it important
that the committee and the house receive
satisfactory assurance that the diversion of
water in the streams for this power development will not in any substantial way lessen
or detract from the beauty and utility of the
park. The map which my honourable friend
sent over to me indicates clearly the portion
of the park that is to be subtracted from the
whole. When the bill is before committee
we can no doubt get further information on
it. However, I wish to emphasize to the
house the importance of Parliament guarding
the integrity of our national heritage in
parks. If we permit ourselves to fall into
the habit, under one pretext or another, of
thinking that the parks may be whittled
down and diminished we shall lose sight of
the initial purpose for which they were
created.
Hon. Mr. Horner: Honourable senators, I
would like to ask the honourable senator
from Churchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar) about a
bill that he sponsored a few years ago which
had the effect of taking a slice off Prince
Albert National Park. I recall that I made
then somewhat the same criticism of his proposal as he is making with respect to this
bill. There was no question of water power
in that instance. I maintained that the portion of the park to be taken away was
natural grazing area for wild animals and
should be maintained as part of the park.
I am surprised that my honourable friend
has become so interested in preserving our
national parks, seeing that he was quite
willing, on another occasion, to allow a portion of the Prince Albert National Park to
be sliced off.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: Honourable senators, may
I have another word? I might have known
that my honourable friend from Blaine Lake
(Hon. Mr. Horner) would bring up the matter
of the Prince Albert National Park. But I
maintain his argument is a very weak one.
The part of that park that was taken out was
only a bill of expense to the park and added
no beauty whatsoever. It was muskeg, a grassgrowing area for wild animals; and, of course,
since it has been taken out of the park the
grass has continued to grow, the trees stihi
stand, and the wild animais stili roar over
the ground.
So I submit there is reaiiy notbîng to the
point raised by my bonourabie friend from
Blaine Lake.
I may say, however, that the Prince Albert
National Park is a park well worth visiting,
if one happens to be in that part of Saskatchewan.

Hon. Gordon B. Isnor: Honourable senators, like the senator from Churchill (Hon.
Mr. Crerar) I too am much interested in our
national parks, largely, I suppose, because
of my connection with the tourist industry
down through the years.
I listened with much interest to the introduction of this bill by the honourable senior
senator from Nova Scotia (Hon. Mr. Quinn),
who told us that he was the one surviving
senator representing his party in the Maritime provinces.
Hon. Mr. Quinn: In this house I was the
one survivor of my party from the whole six
eastern provinces.
Hon. Mr. Isnor: May I be the first to offer
congratulations to my honourable friend, and
to wish him many more years of membership
in the Senate.
My concern as to this bill differs somewhat
from that expressed by the honourable senator from Churchill. I quite appreciate the
position in which the Nova Scotia Power
Commission finds itself with respect to the
development of hydro power. But I was somewhat surprised when the honourable senator
who sponsored the bill stated that this would
give the commission an increase of 28 per cent
in the production of energy. There is another
angle which I, as a Nova Scotian, wonder
if the sponsor has taken into consideration.
I know that he is sincerely interested, as all
members from the province are, in hydro
development and its effect upon our coal
mining situation, and I do not need to remind
him that the situation is serious indeed.
There has been a five-week layoff in the
mines, and unemployment has reached a
peak that we have not seen for many years.
I am concerned about that situation and I
am just wondering what effect this legislation is going to have on it.
Our ability to supply electrical energy is
not as poor as a good many people seem to
think it is. It has been stated on more than
one occasion that industries could not come
to Nova Scotia because we could not supply
them with sufficient electrical energy. That
is a mistaken idea, a fallacy, as was borne
out by recent surveys which disclosed that we
could supply energy for all those who have
applied or intimated they proposed opening
industries in Nova Scotia.
Last year a United Nations survey of hydroelectric rates disclosed that Nova Scotia rates
were in keeping with and were just as low
as those in any portion of eastern Canada and
the eastern section of the United States. In
fact, they were almost as low as the Ontario
hydro rates now being charged.
Honourable senators, I am not opposing
the bill and I am very pleased that it is going
to committee, but I do feel that the sponsor

JULY
should take into serious consideration the
effect this legislation will have on our miners,
and on the employment situation and the coal
industry in general. I would point out that
the greater the amount of hydro power that
is developed, the less will be the demand
for coal to produce energy through steam.
The sponsor of the bill stated that the Nova
Scotia Power Commission made certain representations in November, 1956, and that an
agreement was entered into in January of
1957. I am not sure he told us whether
that agreement was between the Nova Scotia
Power Commission and the federal Government, through the Department of Northern
Affairs and National Resources, or between
the Nova Scotia Government and the federal
Government. Perhaps he would be good
enough to answer that question when he
replies. As a matter of fact, he might be
good enough to table that agreement so that
honourable senators may know exactly what
it provides for.
In looking at this bill I am reminded that
our production of coal in June 1958 declined
by 13 per cent to 692,000 tons, from a total
of 793,112 tons in the same month last year.
These figures are from the Dominion Bureau
of Statistics. I am happy to note that the
landed imports of coal have been considerably
lower, practically cut in half. That is good
news for our part of the country.

Hon. A. K. Hugessen: Honourable senators,
I have only a few words to say on this bill.
I do not propose to enter into the controversy
between the honourable senator from Churchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar) and the honourable
senator from Blaine Lake (Hon. Mr. Horner),
but anyone who has ever travelled in that
part of Canada in which the Cape Breton
Highlands National Park is situated will agree
at once that it is one of the most beautiful
parts of Canada. I do think, as has been said
by the honourable gentleman from Churchill,
we should take very great care when we are
faced with a proposal of this kind to remove
some portion of an area that has been set
aside for a national park. I am glad that the
honourable gentleman who sponsored this bill
(Hon. Mr. Quinn) said he proposed to have
it sent to committee after second reading,
for it is in committee that we shall be able
to get the information which will enable us
to determine whether or not the taking away
of a section from the park as proposed can be
justified from the point of view of the public
interest. According to the map which the
honourable senator has furnished us, it
appears that the section is, as the honourable
senator from Halifax-Dartmouth (Hon. Mr.
Isnor) said, almost in the heart of the park.
But it is in the rather remote centre of the
park; as far as I can see it is an area that
is, at the present time, at any rate, far
removed from any public highway, or public

on
Monday, July 21, 1958, at il a.m.
Dr. Nk'rumah was welcomed by the Right Honourable J. G. Diefenbaker, Prime
Minister of Canada, and thanlced by the Honourable Mark Robert Drouin, Speaker of
the Senate and the Honourable Roland Michener, Speaker of the House of Commons.
Righi Hon. J. G. Diefenbaker (Prime
Minister of Canada>: Mr. Speaker of the
Senate, Mr. Speaker of the House of Commons
and members of the Parliament of Canada:
Dr. Nkrumah, on behaîf of the Parliament
and people of Canada I extend a warm
welcome to you and your ministers who are
associated with you on this occasion, the
Honourable Mr. Botsio and the Honourable
Mr. Baako. I welcome you as the Prime
Minister of the first truly African state to
attain dominion status within the -commonwealth.
I fIrst met Dr. Nkrumah at the Prime Ministers' Conference in London last June, a
few short months after his country had
become an independent nation within the
commonwealth. 1 think the emergence of
Ghana to equal status within the commonwealth is symbolic o! the commonwealth
concept as it develops to meet change and
changing conditions. Canadians have pride in
the role that Canada has played in the evolution of this commonwealth. In this commonwealth, nations, equal and independent, join
together in their dedication to freedom
through the practice of parliamentary democracy in the tradition o! the Mother of Parliaments at Westminster, thereby bringing
peace, progress and prosperity to peoples
everywhere in the world.
It was Sir Robert Borden who in 1919,
following the sacrifices of the first world
war, secured for Canada recognition of her
sovereign status as a signatory of the peace
treaty and as a member of the League o!
Nations; further steps along that pathway
have been taken by suceeding prime ministers of Canada. The commonwealth to me
represents an institution which, in its inherent greatness, gives hope to mankind. A

world organization o! many races, beliefs and
religions, we have no political uniformity
without law or by law; its unity is in the
dedication of its peoples to freedom; its glory
is that ail share in a common heritage; its
purpose, peace for ahl mankind; the bonds
of its unity maintained by the good sense,
good will and good faith of its diverse peoples.
Because o! this principle it does not stagnate in formalism. It is ever growing; it is
living. From time to time in the years ahead
other nations will join its ranks and two -confederations, that of Nigeria and that of the
West Indies, have not long to wait for
membership.
If I might I should like to say a word as
to the constitution o! Ghana, for it illustrates
what I have placed before you, namely, that
there is no uniformity in the political systems
o! the various portions of this commonwealth.
Ghana has a unicameral legislature. Five
regions comprise the state which came about
through the uniting of the Gold Coast with
Togoland. Each region has an assembly with
powers which are not unlike those o! our
provinces. Each region has a House of Chiefs
with power to consider any matter referred
to it by a minister or the national assembly.
Mr. Prime Minister, the achievement of full
sel!-governing membership in the commonwealth to which you led your people was a
swif t, orderly and constitutional. march, a
tribute to your devotion and a credit to the
United Kingdom, which in its finest and best
traditions paved the way for the emergence
o! your nation as a new nation within this
commonwealth. Indeed, in little over half a
century the commonwealth concept, adapted
to the needs of your country, has brought
about the transition of a land o! diverse
peoples with traditional. African culture into

SENATE
a modern state with a new and energetic
economie life whose purpose it is to raise the
standards of its people and develop its resources and the talents of its people.
I betray no state secret, Mr. Prime Minister,
when I say that last June and July I was
deeply impressed by your ability and by
your personal character, and we became
friends. I say that as a foundation necessary to the relationships which prevail as
between those of us who have responsibilities
in all parts of the commonwealth. We have
something in common. We were both born
on September 18, though you were born a
little bit later than I was.
Your life, sir, is an Alger story. Born in a
humble home, educated in your own country,
you went abroad in order to widen that education in the United States of America, were
graduated from Lincoln University and the
University of Pennsylvania, and later attended
the London School of Economics. I know
your philosophy of life from personal conversation with you. However, I prefer to
quote your own words on one occasion, when
you said this: In truth the burden of my life
can be summarized in "The Memoriam"
quoted by Cecil Rhodes-"So much to do, so
little done".
You have done much. You have much
still to do in order to bring about that unity
among peoples, without regard to colour or
race, which has been your life work. It is
thus my pleasure to welcome you to Canada,
and, as a representative of an older partner
of the commonwealth, to welcome your country as one of the latest in the family of
nations within the commonwealth.
I introduce to you the Prime Minister of
Ghana, Dr. Kwame Nkrumah.
Dr. Kwame Nkrumah (Prime Minister of
Ghana): Mr. Speaker of the Senate, Mr.
Speaker of the House of Commons, Mr. Prime
Minister and honourable members of the
Parliament of Canada: It is a great pleasure
for me to address this August assembly today.
I wish to express the gratitude of the people
of Ghana and my own appreciation for the
honour your Prime Minister and his government have done our country by inviting me
to pay this visit to Canada. I wish to thank
you very sincerely, Mr. Prime Minister, for
the kind words with which you have just
welcomed me.
We in Ghana have a strong feeling of pride
in our commonwealth membership. I had
the privilege of attending the commonwealth
Prime Ministers' Conference in London last
year, when for the first time in history the
first African state entered that great and free
association of states stretching across the
world. The meeting provided an invaluable

opportunity for establishing personal relationships with other prime ministers and political
leaders, and I am particularly happy that I
have been able to renew my friendship with
your distinguished Prime Minister, Mr.
Diefenbaker, for whom I have had great
admiration since my first meeting with him.
On attaining Our indepedence we in Ghana
chose to become a member of the commonwealth of our own free will. We enjoy the
same institutions of parliamentary democracy
and the same climate of politics and public
morality as the other members. We have the
same respect for tradition and the same regard
for ceremonial. We place the same value on
the human individual and appreciate the dignity of restraint. We accept the sovereignty
of law and the sanctity of the pledged word.
The family relationship between members
of the commonwealth, which we have already
experienced and which brings together countries widely differing in race, religion and
social background, is an example of international association which we shall always
support so long as it continues to be based on
sound democratic principles and respect for
the sovereignty of the member nations.
Canada is in a sense the founder of the
commonwealth, for it was in the conception
of a free association between Canada and the
mother country that the foundations of the
commonwealth were laid. Canada has made
a great contribution to the world by the successful working of her institutions, her government, the spectacular development of her
national resources, and the constructive initiative taken in international affairs. The
spirit of tolerance and mutual confidence
among peoples of different racial groups that
has evolved in this community is an achievement which is a shining example to all of us.
Canada also serves as an invaluable link
between the great North American continent
and its people and the rest of the world.
We believe that Ghana, as the first truly
African state to join the commonwealth, also
has a contribution to make to the enrichment
of the life of the world community. Just
as you in Canada have given the world the
benefit of your experience and views arising
out of your position on this great continent,
so we in Africa hope that we will also be
able to contribute our views for the common
benefit of the community of nations. We feel
that through us and through other African
nations a general understanding between the
African continent and the various members
of the commonwealth will be developed. We
realize the great responsibilities that this
position imposes on us, but we are ready
and prepared to take up the challenge.
Recently we took the initiative in convening a conference of independent African

JULY 22, 1958
states, a conference which proved to be most
successful. I myseif have recently returned
from a tour of the capitals of the other states
which participated in the conference. We
are endeavourmng to establish among aurselves in Africa a fundamental unity on
domestic and foreign policy which is, I think,
of special significance to the role of the
African nations in world affairs. We are determined to work tagether in the economic
and cultural fields, with the abject of raising
the standard of 111e of our peoples and making a distinctive African contribution to iternational discussions and the achievement
of world peace. We are determined that
through mutual co-operation and collective
leadership we free and independent African
states shail not only safeguard aur hard-won
independence but also use ail the means
available ta us to emancipate those of our
brethren who are still under colonial rule.
I flnd nothing incompatible with our effectiveness as a member of the United Nations
and the commnonwea:Ith in pursuing an African objective and prajecting an African
personality. On the contrary I see in it great
possibilities for good, because we should be
able ta bring to aur deliberatians in the
United Nations and the commonwealth a
better understanding of the African point of
view, and make a distinctive contribution
taward reaching acceptable solutions to aur
many problems.
I should like ta take this oppartunity to
comment an certain aspects of aur foreign
policy. Basically the policy of our government
is one of non-alignment and positive neutrality. I have emphasized on several occasions,
however, that this should not be interpreted
as a purely negative neutralism. On the contrary, we will always adopt whatever positive
pollcy wiil do most to safeguard aur independence. We have a vested interest in peace,
and we will do everything i aur power ta
support the United Nations.
Like many other smafl cauntries we have
appealed ta the great powers ta suspend
nuclear bomb tests. We pray that pragress
can be made ini achieving somie degree of
disarmament, thus permittmng part of the vast
resources naw applied ta the barren task
af praducing strnl mare terrible weapons of
destruction ta be transferred ta the constructive and hopeful task of assisting the peaples
in the less developed cauntries ta eliminate
disease and poverty fram their lives.
I have came ta Canada at a time when
great international tension has been generated
by recent developments in the Middle East.
The attitude o! my gavernment ta this situation was made clear i the statement issued
on July 16, just before I left. We believe
that any attempt ta pass judgment on what
57075-4-24

has happened would at this stage simply
heighten tension, and the task naw is ta
secure a warkable solution for the future.
This, we suggest, could be based on three
principles; the substitution o! a United Nations force for the American traops now in
Lebanon; the halding of free elections in
that country under United Nations supervision, and the subsequent establishment of
Lebanan as a free and independent state
with a status of neutrality, internationaily
guaranteed on the analagy of Austria. As ta
the immediate situation, I am confident that
1 express the views o! the leaders o! the
other independent African states when I say
that ail o! us pray that the leaders of the
great powers will came ta an understanding
which will spare us, wha are nat; parties ta
their disputes, and the rest of mankind from
the unbelievable horrars of modern war.
Today, sa it seems ta me, the fate af mankind rests in the hands of a few men. I
pray that they are fully aware o! their vast
responsibilities.
May I say how greatly we ini Ghana have
been impressed and inspired by Canada's
record i the field o! international aiT airs in
recent years. We feel that camman sense,
decency and reasonableness have invariably
reinforced the admirable attitudes you have
taken in the 'United Nations and the wlse
counsel which you have cantributed ta the
commonwealth.
One other aspect of aur international relations on which I wish ta tauch is that of
economic develapment. Like any other less
develaped country, we wish ta banish disease,
ignorance and poverty f rom. aur land. We
realize that we can only do this i ca-operation with other cauntries and gaverruments.
We are the world's greatest praducer of cacoa,
but lil<e other ane-crap cauntries we are at
the mercy of world prices. As you knaw,
the recessian af the last year has already
had disastrous palitical cansequences quite
apart from its ecanomic effects for several
o! the gavernments of those less developed
areas.
In aur own case I attach the highest importance ta increasing the productivity o! aur
agriculture, and ta starting the industrialization a! aur country. The carnerstone of aur
future development is the successful impiementation o! aur great Volta river praject for
the production of aluminum. Here again the
recessian has affected aur basic plans mast
prafoundly for aluminum producers are now
naturally reluctant ta increase capacity. Like
everyone else, I trust that this recession wil
end very quickly and that the expansion o!
the North American ecanomy, which can sa

SENATE
decisively affect our own hopes for the future
and the hopes of all less developed countries,
will soon be resumed.
It is this situation which to me most
vividly illustrates the community of interest
and common purpose which should exist
between the dollar and sterling areas on the
one hand and the less developed countries
on the other. The sustained development
of the resources of the less developed
countries would not only reduce their economic vulnerability and thus consolidate
their vitally important political independence,
but at the same time raw materials would
continue to be produced for the more
advanced industrial nations, thus ensuring
the maintenance of high levels of employment and the expansion of world trade, a
process which of itself is essential for the
survival of the western economies.
In recent years I believe that the common
interest and identity of purpose between the
wealthier nations and the less developed
areas has not been adequately recognized.
I hope the forthcoming commonwealth economic conference will give adequate consideration to this basic truth, and in particular
pay far greater attention than in the past to
of economic
political implications
the
development.
All of us in our separate ways, both as
individuals and as nations, desperately seek
for a world of peace where men and women
may bring up their children in security and
with confidence in the future. I believe that
apart from general disarmament and the
abolition of nuclear tests nothing could do
more to achieve this hope than that all likeminded countries should gather together and
cooperate in achieving sustained and balanced economic development among themselves, thus expanding world trade and improving the common welfare of all people.
Before I conclude I should like to express
the appreciation of my government and the
people of Ghana to this great country of
Canada for the many manifestations of
interest which you have already demonstrated in our affairs since independence,
and for the very welcome assistance in a
number of fields, economic, social and cultural, which we have received from you.
We can best show our appreciation of this
assistance by ensuring that it is used for the
maximum benefit of all people.
May I thank you once again for the bonour and privilege of addressing this great
assembly. I pray that this occasion will
always be remembered as the beginning of
an enduring friendship between Canada and
Ghana, a friendship based on a common
belief in the dignity of all mankind and in

the right of all people to control their own
affairs, dedicated to the pursuit of peace.
Thank you.
(Translation):
Hon. Mark Robert Drouin (Speaker of the
Senate): It is on behalf of the Canadian
Senate, Mr. Prime Minister, that I have the
great honour of welcoming you to this house
which, in your country as in ours, symbolizes
the respect of our two peoples, Ghana and
Canada, for parliamentary democratic institutions, those pillars upon which, notwithstanding differences in culture and tradition,
rests the close unity of commonwealth
nations.
This union of different peoples under the
banner of parliamentary democracy is no
mere gesture. The Canadian people which, as
you have seen, is made up of various racial
communities, have managed, through democratic institutions in their federal form, to
fashion and pursue a common ideal and to
respect each other's essential characteristics.
It is with an equal respect for their diversity
and an unshakeable faith in their common
ideal that Canada looks upon the nations of
the commonwealth, whether they be African,
like yours, Mr. Prime Minister, Asiatic or
Anglo-Saxon.
You are the head of a new African nation,
independent within the commonwealth and
called to a high destiny, not only on your
own continent, but in the whole democratic
world as well. Heir to the traditions of
ancient Africa's civilization and to British
parliamentary institutions and conscious of
the responsibility implied by that privilege,
your country has already undertaken to give
them dynamic and positive expression. Since
your recent accession to independence, your
government, with astonishing courage, has
already started to develop the natural resources of your beautiful country.
Apart from your great love for Africa and
your deep understanding of that country, you
yourself, Mr. Prime Minister, have brought
to your role of nation builder an extensive
knowledge of the North American continent
gained during your studies in the United
States. It is therefore with very special interest and understanding that Canadians look
upon the unfolding of Ghana's destiny. Just
as each of the two racial groups who inhabit
both our countries are equal partners, enjoying the same rights and privileges, so each
and every one of the nations of the commonwealth are equal partners jointly and severally pursuing objectives of peace and
happiness.
Straightway and by right your country
has become a full member of this great and

JULY 22, 1958
noble commonwealth family. You are welcome into it, and beyond the Atlantic and the
African continent we extend a friendly hand
to all the citizens of Ghana whose beloved
Sovereign, it seems only fitting to point out,
is the same as ours.
The people of Canada appreciate your having made us this visit in spite of your pressing responsibilities. On my own behalf and
on behalf of the Senate of Canada, I ask you
to accept our thanks for your kind words and
to convey to your compatriots the expression
of our sincere admiration and faithful
friendship.
(Text):
Hon. Roland Michener (Speaker of the
House of Commons): Prime Minister Nkrumah, in bringing this memorable session to
a conclusion may I add a word of thanks
on behalf of the House of Commons. I assure
you, sir, that our meeting today has been
all too short, having regard to the significance
of your visit and the interest you have
inspired in us, and in all Canadians, in our
brother country of Ghana. We should gladly
have given you the unlimited time which is
accorded in this chamber to a Prime Minister
or a Leader of the Opposition, as against the
few minutes which you have taken. It would
have been a pleasure, too, to hear from the
distinguished members of your government
who accompany you, and whom we are so
happy to welcome. May I express a personal
regret that we are not able to meet that
remarkable man, Sir Emmanuel Quist, the
former Speaker of your legislative assembly,
whose contribution to the establishment of
parliamentary methods in your new legislature must have been indispensable.
Your visit, in your capacity as representative of the youngest member of the great and
growing family of nations which make up
the commonwealth, is not only appropriate
but it is a touching recognition and furtherance of our fraternal relations. It gives to
your older Canadian brother another opportunity to inspect and dote upon the new baby.
I hope the metaphor will not be offensive.
As Sir Winston Churchill might have said,
"Some baby". In fact your phenomenal
growth in political stature from the cradle to
majority and independence in the last ten
years is in contrast to our own unhurried but
steady evolution over a century from colony
to independence.
From 1791 to 1867 we had three constitutional advances to self-government, and took
another 50 years to excercise independence
in external affairs. In your case, if we leave
out of account the Burns constitution of 1946,
which within 18 months was described as
outmoded at birth, you rapidly outgrew two
57075-4-24J

new constitutions, those of 1951 and 1954, and
reached full stature on March 6, 1957. Then
you donned the constitutional garment which
you now wear with so much apparent comfort and sophistication.
Apart from this contrast in the rate of our
political growth there are many similarities
in our history in the commonwealth family.
As has been said, we gave the lead to the
original four British dominions which, with
the United Kingdom, made up the British
commonwealth. You have given the lead to
the African states. Your democracy, like ours,
is modelled on that remarkable British invention of responsible parliamentary government. As I have said on other occasions, this
common use of parliamentary institutions
which runs throughout the nations of the
commonwealth today gives us all an understanding and a confidence in each other's
policies and politics which is a solid basis
for future friendhip and co-operation.
From what I read, you in Ghana have already mastered the parliamentary art. Your
great speech in the independence debate, with
its understanding of British policy and African
needs, its eloquence and its sincerity, its apt
quotations from Burke, Aristotle and Tennyson, was in the highest tradition. I am told,
too, that if you had any notes on that occasion
they were not the copious notes the Speaker
hears about in some other houses.
Some other of your new parliamentary
practices will endear you to our members.
For example, you are reported once to have
advised an exasperating member to go have
a drink of orange juice. Your ministers, too,
seem to follow familiar patterns in dealing
with questions before the orders of the day.
This example comes from John Gunther:
Mr. Kusi asked the Minister of Agriculture and
Natural Resources(a) what is the estimated population of the
tsetse fly?
(b) Is there any evidence that the number Is
increasing?
Mr. Casely-Hayford: (a) There is no available
record of tsetse fly population.
(b) In view of the answer to part (a) of the
question, the answer is no.

We thank you, sir, for your visit and your
message. It has been said that the darkest
thing about Africa has been our ignorance
of it. You are doing much to dispel this
ignorance. We honour you for the outstanding leadership which you are giving in Ghana.
We honour your country for its assumption
of the responsibilities of self-government. So
much depends in West Africa on its success
and its example. Please bear with you when
you return to Ghana the heartfelt good wishes
of the Canadian Parliament and people for
all your high endeavours.

mittee on Bill S-9.

JULY 23, 1958
Hon. David A. Croll: Honourable senators,
it will be recalled that this bill was introduced in the Senate on Tuesday, July 8,
at which time the sponsor, (Hon. Mr. Brunt)
made a short explanation, outlining the important highlights. The matter was then put
over for second reading until Thursday,
July 10, when the Leader of the Opposition
(Hon. Mr. Macdonald), speaking on the motion for second reading, pointed out that
copies of the bill had not yet been distributed to honourable senators. The fact was
that copies had just been distributed at that
minute but honourable members had had no
time in which to study the bill. The sponsor
then asked for an opportunity to make the
Government's statement on the bill and he
suggested that the honourable Leader of
the Opposition (Hon. Mr. Macdonald) could
then move adjournment of the debate to
give honourable senators ample opportunity
to study the bill and go over his explanatory
remarks. He proceeded to make an explanation, during the course of which he was
considerably interrupted. There was no time
for honourable senators to read the bill and
to listen and give consideration to his statement. As a result we have a somewhat disjointed statement. I think it is well to indicate
that those who make statements when introducing bills in this bouse should in a mild
and kindly manner head off questions from
the floor until they have completed their
statements. We had a good illustration of
this last night when three different bills were
introduced, statements made and questions
asked afterwards. Under such conditions,
when we come to read the record at a later
date it gives us the full story. When a person explains a bill and finds that a
questioner is persistent, I think that under
the rules he can brush him off for the
time being. There is a time for consideration
and a time to ask questions and, in any
event, there is likely to be a committee stage.
On Thursday, July 10, the honourable
senator from Wellington (Hon. Mr. Howard)
said that he wanted time to discuss the
matter with some companies in his constituency. It seemed a reasonable request,
and the debate was then adjourned. On Tuesday, July 15, the honourable Leader of the
Opposition said that he had considered the
bill and gave it qualified approval. The honourable senator from Inkerman (Hon. Mr.
Hugessen) who, by the way, is an eminent
authority on these matters, said that he had
discussed the matter with the trust companies, and he, too, was able to vote for the
principle involved in the bill. At that sitting
the bill was given second reading and the
sponsor moved that it be sent to the Banking
and Commerce Committee the following day,

Wednesday, the 16th. He advised us that he
had already made arrangements for the hearing by the committee of Jules Fortin, Secretary-Treasurer of the Dominion Mortgage and
Investments Association. Mr. Fortin is an
excellent authority on these matters, and he
was to speak on behalf of the trust and loan
companies. The committee was also to hear
from Mr. MacGregor, the Superintendent of
Insurance. Now, that precipitous meeting was
the first mistake. All members of this house
should know that Wednesday is caucus day
for all parties. It bas been traditionally so.
Caucuses are important, not only for the
Government, but also as means of keeping us
aware of what is going on and giving us an
opportunity to meet the members of the
House of Commons at least once a week.
It had always been the custom for the
chairman of the Banking and Commerce
Committee, of which I am a member, to canvass the members to ascertain whether they
will be available for a meeting and if the
meeting time is satisfactory. This was not the
case. I speak only for myself; I was preoccupiedHon. Mr. Aseliine: May I ask the honourable senator a question? Was there not a
meeting in the morning, and another meeting
after the house adjourned in the afternoon?
Hon. Mr. Croll: On Wednesday I was busy
all day, along with six other senators, carrying out duties that this bouse has imposed
upon us; they were not very pleasant, but
we did them-we didn't have any choice
about the matter. I did not object, because I
expected that I would see the record of the
Banking and Commerce Committee and read
the evidence, but, Io and behold! to my
amazement no record of the evidence was
taken. So we have a debate today, not so
much because of opposition to the bill, but
because, owing to lack of information, it
comes to us half-baked.
Hon. Mr. Pouliot: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Croll: We spent a great deal of
energy, but it has been mostly misdirected.
I think we might as well have an understanding now that we cannot ring a fire bell
on originating legislation in this house. This
is a Parliament and not a production line.
Short of repetition and filibuster, it is better
to have more talk than to have less talk, and
it is better to have more consideration rather
than less consideration. These committee
meetings have to be planned in order that they
may not conflict with other committee meetings where members have duties and responsibilities. But what is more important, this
bill is originating legislation-it started in

committee and cornmitted himself very definitely on behaif of this bill after hearîng the
case explained to him. I for one personaily
object to having Mr. MacGregor share any
accusation of having a bill rigged before our
comrnittee.
Hon. Mr. Croli: May I say to the honourable senator from Ottawa (Hon. Mr. Lambert)
that Mr. MacGregor is a highly respected
public servant. He gave his evidence but
he does not vote on the bill. I do vote on
the bill. If I have opinions on itHan. Mr. Lambert: Well, I abide by the

the honourable senator from Gulf (Hon. Mr.

quite agree with ail of what you say about
Mr. MacGregor's evidence.
Now, we can choose any one of three
courses of action. We could ask for a vote
and possibiy defeat the bill. As I have aiready
indicated, I arn not ini favour of defeating the
bill. We could pass the bill today, but if we do
that I think it wiU leave those who are
affected by it under sornewhat of a cloud
because the whole story has not yet been
heard. The third course, and the one which
I suggest to this house, is that the bill be
sent back to cornmittee for a full hearing, and
that the commtttee fix a day weil in1 advance,
send out invitations to the bodies I have
already named and other bodies and persons
who may be interested, and record the
proceedings. I recomrnend to this house that
the bill be returned for a full and exhaustive
study. I say the study must be exhaustive.
If it is nat, there wiil be criticism of this
house outside Parliament and from the other
house.
What we do in this house we pride aurselves upon doing weil. In the past we have
flot been afraid to correct our mistakes. This
is one. And while there is tirne to correct
our mistake it is my recornrendatjon that
we do s0 just as soon as possible. We can
study this bill ail next week. There is fia
special urgency.
These campanies have
already waited five years; they can wat
another two weeks.
Hon. Jean-François Pouliot: Honourable
senatars, this is a bill which I have taken
trouble ta read and tried hard to understand.
A journalist wrote during the electian campaign that members of Parliament were flot
supposed ta be trained seals. That applies as
well ta the Senate, and I do not see why
we should remain here ta say "Amen, amen"
to alI the legislation that cornes before us.

There are two kinds of legisiatian. There is
good, progressive legisiation, conservative
legisiation, and an the other hand there is
bad hegisiation. This is legishatian at its
worst. I arn sorry ta have ta say so, but
it is not the first time that I have had ta fight
bad legisiation. I did it perpetually in the
House of Commons, with some success, although it required a lot of patience at tirnes.
We have for consideratian twa bills, concerning trust and Joan companies. They were
sponsored by the honourable senator from
Hanover (Hon. Mr. Brunt), who I regret is
not here this afternaan. He seemed ta be
reluctant ta sponsor the bis, and when he
was asked some painted questions by a nurnber of his coileagues-by the honourable
senator fram Gulf (Han. Mr. Power), the
honourabie senatar from Churchill (Hon. Mr.
Crerar), the honaurable senator for TorontoTrinity (Han. Mr. Roebuck), the honourable
senator for Taronta-Spadina
(Hon. Mr.
Cr011), by the honourable senator from Waterloo (Han. Mr. Euler) and many others-he
said, "Well this legisiatian is introduced at
the request of the trust and Joan campantes."
Is that an answer, honourable senatars? Are
we here ta please and nat ta displease, or
ta do what is right and not ta do what we
consider wrong? Since when has the desire
of the trust and Joan campantes been the
narrn for legisiation that is brought bef are
Parliament? One must have a higher regard
of Parliament than that, and this kind of
legisiatian is a subi ect that rernains in the
minds of the people.
If yau are gaing ta do samething for the
trust and loan campanies, why not do it for
everybody in every walk of life in Canada?
Then everybody will be able ta corne here
and see members of the cabinet, or any high
officiai of the party in power at the present
tirne, and say, "I wiil be very grateful ta
you if yau pass such-and-such legishation."
I understand that can be done for private
legisiation, but nat for public legislation.
'Public legislation must in the first place be
foar the benefit of the Canadian people, and
nobody can deny that. But this bill is not
for the Canadian people at large; it is for a
smali- group of impartant capitalists, nat for
the interest of the investors in their
campantes.
Foliowing what has been so ably said by
the honourable senator from Toronto-Spadina
(Hon. Mr. Croil), I think I will mave that
thase who came befare the committee in the
first place shail nat be the Superintendent of
Insurance, for whorn I have regard, as everybody has, but the very directors themseives

SENATE
Government to ask for this legislation. They
must be bold enough to defend their position
before Parliament, before the Senate Committee on Banking and Commerce, as well as
the committees of the House of Commons.
At the present time there are in the law
certain provisions to control those people
who consider themselves more important than
the Almighty. I speak of the directors of the
trust and loan companies, all of them. They
think they can make the law in this country.
It is time to stop it, and we are the ones who
can stop it. We are here to act according to
our personal convictions and principles. Why
should we be impressed by money? I admit
that the Christians of nowadays are more
materialistic than the Jews who worshipped
the Golden Calf. There are, nevertheless,
sound principles of legislation which shall
never be forgotten and must always be respected by Parliament.
As I have already remarked, the sponsor
of this legislation (Hon. Mr. Brunt) is not in
the chamber at present, but I would remind
him that the fight by our forefathers for constitutional rights, for responsible government,
must ever be kept in mind. What they did
must be again the inspiration of all of us.
As somebody once told me, the financial
ring could not be broken in the Senate.
My answer was: "There is no financial ring.
I know none of my colleagues would put
personal interests before public interests."
This is a case where I hope the decision of
this house will confirm the good opinion I
have of my colleagues. We ask nothing
more than light; we want clarification of
the request of the trust and loan companies,
and we must get it. How can it be said that
the legislation is for the benefit of the public
and not for the benefit of the trust companies? It is in a very strange way. At
the present time a minimum of reserves and
paid-up capital is required. The honourable
gentleman who sponsored the bill said: "Oh,
it is not enough; what is subscribed and is
paid is much more than that. The act mentions $250,000, but no company has less than
$1 million." And what does he do? He
suggests that the minimum should be dropped, so that we may have many new companies to compete with the banks and other
institutions. There is no protection for their
interests.
What is extremely important is that the
trust and loan companies want to extend
their business from ten times to twelve and
one-half times the amount of their reserves.
Imagine! If they want a larger sphere of
action in business, it is easy for them to get
it. They have only to take the trouble of
subscribing more capital, and then they
would have more money and credit to deal

with. But they do not do that; they want
to have a larger sphere of action with the
same reserves, thereby creating inflation.
Everybody complains about inflation; governments vote hundreds of millions of dollars apparently to stop inflation, but here
is a small piece of legislation which is like
termites that destroy the pillars of the state
and may create inflation. The companies
are asking for a big thing, yet they have
nothing to say. It is most ridiculous and
most absurd. I do not see how it can be
put seriously to my colleagues, who are men
of experience in business and good Canadians. I do not intend to quote everything
that was said by the honourable gentleman
who sponsored this bill, but I would refer
honourable members to Hansard of July 10.
If you read that you will see I have not
exaggerated. There is no single reason for
the adoption of this piece of legislation and
I think it should be sent to committee, where
the various officials can be called to give us
an explanation and all the information we
require before we pass such a bill. If this
is dono the Senate will have rendered a
service of great importance to this country,
a service that is expected of us.
In amendment to the motion for third
reading, I therefore move, seconded by the
Honourable Senator Croll, that the bill be
not now read the third time but that it be
referred back to the Standing Committee on
Banking and Commerce for further consideration.
Hon. Arthur W. Roebuck: Honourable
senators, I did not know that this amendment was to be moved just before I proposed
to speak for a short time on this question.
I really believe there is a better way of
curing the difficulties in which this house is
now involved than by sending this bill back
to committee for further consideration. I
think a method which would satisfy the
mover and seconder of the resolution just
made would be for the sponsor of this bill
to strike out clause 12, which permits the
companies to use amortized values. The rest
of the bill is quite satisfactory. I make this
suggestion because this is just a matter of
business and common sense and it is something
which should not be made a great issue of in
this house. It is unnecessary. We have not
yet heard any really cogent argument in
favour of clause 12. The trust companies
have been able to get along for a great many
years without this method of accounting to
which so serious objection is being taken. It
will not hurt them to go on in the manner
in which they have proceeded and made
money in the past, during which time they
have given great service to the people of
this dominion.

JULY 23, 1958
I think the proposed change in the form
of the statements is a vicious one, not a wise
one. I do not want to be dramatic about this
measure, for I think we should avoid that
sort of thing in this type of discussion. It
should be a prosaic discussion rather than a
heated one. We have not been shown any
necessity for the change, and I for one look
with a very great deal of apprehension on
what may follow this method of accounting.
Honourable senators, I am not speaking
without some knowledge of the subject under
discussion. As most of my colleagues know,
the Insurance Branch of the Attorney General's Department of the province of Ontario

was under my control for a considerable
length of time. I had a great deal to do with
just the type of work that is assigned to the
Insurance Department of the dominion Government. We examined the books and
weighed the assets of the trust companies
against their liabilities and we did our best
to see that the companies justified part of
their name; that is, that they were trustworthy. The problems we faced were not
always easy ones. That statement may recall
to the minds of my colleagues that there
have been in Canada bonds of the character
described here that have fallen in value. As
an outstanding example I would refer to the
drop in market value some years ago of
bonds of the province of Alberta. As I believe
things now stand, as the act seems to imply,
trust companies which held those bonds at
that time would have been forced to value
them, for the purposes of inspection by the
departments, at their actual sales value at
the time of inspection. If you pass this bill
and allow companies to value bonds at their
amortized value, it will be the price at which
the bonds were bought, subject to such payments as have been made in the meantime.
But the essence of it is that it will be the
purchase price of those bonds and not their
true value. In other words, the statements
which will be supplied to the Department of
Insurance in such circumstances will be exceedingly false and misleading and will
vitiate the very purpose for which the examinations of these bonds are decreed.
If I may, let me for a moment make a general statement before I return to a discussion
of the act itself. I listened with a great
deal of interest to the eloquent remarks of
the honourable member from Gulf (Hon.
Mr. Power) during this debate, in which he
intimated, perhaps not in these exact words
but in effect at least, that this .chamber was
in some way the protector of capital and
property. He reinforced his statement by
saying that perhaps he should not be here
at all with the views and attitudes which
he possesses. He said that when the Senate

was organized the idea was that senators
would be protectors of property rights, and
to ensure that end it was provided that all
senators should have property qualifications.
I do not know what attitude senators took
in 1867, and it is not particularly interesting
now, but if the property qualifications specified in the British North America Act
were important in those days, let me say to
my fellow senators that they are not important today. The amount is $4,000, which
in 1867 was a lot of money. Today I suppose
it is a reasonable down payment on the
purchase of a house.
An Hon. Senator: Or a car.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Or on the purchase price
of a car, yes. It seems to me that there are
very few people with the experience and
the years, and usually with the activities,
that precede an appointment to this house,
whose appointment would in any way be
interfered with by those property qualifications. Almost everybody appointed to the
Senate today could qualify as owning property to the extent of $4,000, and therefore
that feature of the qualifications for appointment to the Senate is unimportant. My experience, which is now considerably over a
decade in this chamber, is that the senators
of today are not defenders of property as
such, but rather represent the people of the
dominion of Canada in the same broad way
as does the honourable member from Gulf
(Hon. Mr. Power). In all my adult years I
have been an advocate of workingmen's
causes, but I would not describe myself as
a partisan of workingmen. I am not for workingmen; I am for men, and as I conceive
my duty here it is to hold the balance fair
and square between men, no matter how
much they possess. There is no such thing as
rights of property. There are rights of people
with regard to property, but property itself
has no rights. In this house my observation is
that we hold that balance clearly and fairly
as between all men, be they ever so rich
or ever so poor and humble. I say this because of the general tenor of the remarks of
the honourable member from Gulf, which
might lead to the impression that he at least
thought that we in the Senate are subject to
the dictates of men of large accumulations
of capital, such as the trust companies, that
we are the pliant servants of the House of
Have. We are nothing of the kind. I approach
the question involved in this bill with this
attitude, not as a partisan of one class or
another, but as one who desires the best
benefit to all the people, and I include in
my good wishes for well-being the trust
companies, and all others, be they rich or
poor.

JULY 23, 1958
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: What is the reference?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Section 85 of the Trust
Companies Act. It is not in the Criminal
Code. Of course there are provisions in the
Criminal Code about making false statements,
but so serious were the legislators of the
past with regard to these trust companies
that they put in a special clause against inclusion in any statement of a misleading or
false value that might mislead the people
whose responsibility it is to supervise the
affairs of these important concerns.
Hon. Mr. Lamberi: Are you implying that
the placing of an amortized value on the
securities would be misleading?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Yes, I am. I think it
would be most misleading.
Now, just a comment or two more before
I return to the actual bill. It has been said
in this debate that one of the reasons for
granting this concession to the trust companies is that it is already possessed by the
banks and the insurance companies. Well, I
submit in the first place that the analogy is
not a good one. These trust companies are
not banks and they are not insurance companies. They perform different functions. But
however that may be, how often, fellow
senators, are we to multiply our mistakes?
We may have had reason for giving that
power to the banks, or we may have made a
mistake when we gave it to the banks. One
of the indications that we made a mistake is
the fact that our action is now advanced as
an argument why we should give it to somebody else. Where do we end?
Hon. Mr. Molson: May I ask the honourable
senator a question? Is it not a fact that the
banks did not apply for this power? Is it not
a fact that it was introduced by the Bank of
Canada and then suggested to the chartered
banks?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: I may accept your
statement.
Hon. Mr. Croll: It is the other way around.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: That is correct.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: I do not know. If
that is the way the honourable senator says
it came about I will accept his word for it,
but my judgment as to its advisability is not
in the least influenced by that fact. If we
now grant this power to the trust companies
because we have granted it to the banks, why
not take another step and grant it to all
corporations? If it is sound in this instance,
a most important instance, why not give it
to everybody? That is the effect of a bad
principle. Was it not Shakespeare who said:
The evil that men do lives after them;
The good is oft interred with their bones.

Bad precedents are vital things and may
carry us far, particularly when you allow
corporations to make statements which, under
the circumstances, are untrue.
O, what a tangled web we weave,
When first we practise to deceive!

Let us have the truth, the facts, and the
facts are the sale prices of the bonds at the
time they are being considered. Anything
else in inaccurate. We may describe it in
more drastic terms.
Now, let me come to the act again. I
turn to section 72, headed "Annual Statements". You will notice, honourable senators,
that the whole of section 72 is repealed by
the bill before us.
Subsection (2) of section 72 reads:
The statement shall be In the Form in Schedule
B, and shall be signed and declaration made by
the president or vice-president and by the manager
or secretary as in the Form prescribed.

All right. Now, let us turn to schedule B.
I point out that on the second page of the
schedule, that is page 46 of chapter 272 of
the Revised Statutes, item 5, with regard to
securities, provides:
Particulars thereof with par and market values
and rate of dividend to be given in separate
schedule.

Par and market values are required to be
shown. That is what the schedule says. An
argument was made to me that since this is
in the schedule, the companies would have
to show the market value as well as amortized
value. But what do I find in the bill? I
find that the schedule is abolished. There
is no reference to the schedule in the reenacted clause 72, which reads:
(1) The company shall, on or before the 1st day
of March In each year, prepare and deposit in the
department a statement of the condition and affairs
of the company as of the next preceding 31st day
of December, showing the assets and liabilities of
the company on the said 31st day of December and
its income and expenditures during the year that
ended, together with such other information as the
minister may require.
(2) The statement required by subsection (1) shall
be in such form as the Minister determines and
shall be verified by oath of the president or a vicepresident elected under subsection (1) of section
21 and of the manager or secretary of the company.

No reference, you see, to schedule B. It is
all left in the hands of the minister.
Hon. Mr. Aseline: Has the honourable
senator overlooked subsection 4 of section
12 of the bill, at the top of page 5?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: You are referring to
the amortized value?

people in problems of this
character.
Once again I press upon the administration to drop the objectionable section. It is

Hon. George S. White: Honourable senators,
I wish to make only a few remarks before
this motion passes, and to state on behaîf
of the Government that there is absolutely
no objection to this bill being referred back
to committee.
1 would also like to say that personally I
tbink it rather unfortunate that the last three
senators to speak have seen fit to use, i my
opinion, such strong language as "llack of
'a

"half-baked proposas"~ "
measure that appears to be rigged", "false

remarks were called for in any respect. The
honourable senator fromn Toronto-Spadina
(Hon. Mr. Cr011) reviewed briefiy the passage
of this legislation tbrough our chamber, and
what he said was quite correct. The bill
was mntroduced by the honourable gentleman
from Hanover (Hon. Mr. Brunt), and on the
motion for second reading an objection was
raised by the honourable senator from
Wellington (Hon. Mr. Howard) and bis objection was satisfactorily answered. The sponsor
was permitted to make a statement which,
together witb many questions put to him, by
honourable senators, covers several pages of
Hansard. At the end of bis statement he was
complimented on bis presentation by the
honourable gentleman from. Toronto-Trinity
(Hon. Mr. Roebuck) and the honourable
gentleman from Waterloo (Hon. Mr. Euler).
That was on Thursday, July 10.
The bill came before the Senate again
on the following Tuesday evening, July 15.
The Minutes of the Proceedings show that
those two honourable senators were present
at that meeting. The honourable Leader of
the Opposition (Hon. Mr. Macdonald) spoke
on the resumed debate for the second reading
of the bill and in bis remarks, wbicb are
carried in two columns of Hansard, he expressed approval of the measure. He was
followed by the bonourable gentleman from
Inkerman (Hon. Mr. Hugessen), at the conclusion of wbose remarks the bonourable
senator from Wellington asked that the question be put. As no other senator indicated
be wisbed to speak, the question was put,
tbe bull was read the second time, and tben
on the motion of the sponsor, the bull was

referred to the Standing Committee on Banking and Commerce. There was opportunity
in committee for bonourable senators to obtain
further information, to make statements or
do anything else they wanted ini connection
with the bill, but they did not do so.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: May 1 ask if it is not
a fact that the bill was only distributed that
very afternoon?
Hon. Mr. White: No. I am now speaking
of Tuesday evening, July 15. Copies of the
bill bad been distributed the previous Thursday. The Leader of the Opposition covered
that fact in bis remarks wben he stated he
had had an opportunity to examine tbe
various features of the bill over the weekend.
So the bull bad been in the possession of
bonourable members from Thursday, July 10,
to the following Tuesday, July 15. In any
event, the bill was referred to committee.
Unfortunately I was not present in committee and therefore, as to wbat happened
tbere, I only know wbat my bonourable
colleagues have told me.
The honourable senator from De la Durantaye (Hon. Mr. Pouliot) speaks about a
return to responsible government and asks
whom we are representing in this chamber.
May I say that, being only a country lawyer,
I certainly do not represent any trust companies. I tbink bis remarks suggesting that
any member of the Senate is here as a representative of any body whatever were a
reflection on ahl honourable senators.
As I have said, there is no objection on
the part of the Government to returning this
bill to the Standing Committee on Banking
and Commerce. If other people wish to appear
before the committee it will be all to the good.
Let us have a tborough examination in
committee and let us hear anybody who bas
anything to say either for or against the
measure, and then have the bill come back to
this chamber.
Hon. A. K<.Hugessen: Honourable senators,
I am not normally a very brave man but
this afternoon I amn going to have the temerity to say that I completely disagree with the
rather fervent oratory of the tbree bonourable senators who preceded the honourable
gentleman from Hastings-Frontenac (Hon.
Mr. White) in this debate.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: To rny mind this is
a comparatively simple and innocuous bill,
and I may add, perbaps for the benefit of
the honourable senator from De la Durantaye
(Hon. Mr. Pouliot), that I arn neither a
shareholder of nor do I represent in a legal
capacity any of the trust companies affected
by this legislation.

SENATE

We have heard a good deal this afternoon
from the honourable gentleman from TorontoTrinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck) about this artificial method of valuation which he says is
going to be false and misleading. I want
honourable senators to be quite certain as
to just how false and misleading this information is going to be. The honourable senator from Gulf (Hon. Mr. Power) seemed to
believe that the proposed new section 72A of
the act, which provides for an actuarial
valuation of dominion and provincial securities, will permit these trust companies to
make false statements of their financial
position to the public. I quote from what he
said on July 17:
It is true that somewhere in its report the company is obliged to give the market value, but what
goes out to the public is not the market value but
the amortized value, which in some cases may be a
great deal lower than the market value-

Then section 48 requires the shareholders
to appoint an auditor at each annual meeting,
and it contains the usual provisions that a
director or officer cannot be an auditor. In
other words, an auditor has to be an independent agent of the shareholders.
Section 49 deals with the duties of the
auditor. Subsection (1) says that he has a
right of access at all times to the books and
accounts, and so forth. Then subsection (2)
says:
The auditors shall make a report
(a) to the shareholders on the statement submitted to the company at the annual general meeting; and
(b) to the Minister on the annual statement to
be prepared and transmitted to him in pursuance
of this act.

There is the clear distinction between the
statement the company has to give to its shareholders at the annual meeting and the stateThe honourable senator from Southern New ment the company has to furnish to the
Brunswick (Hon. Mr. McLean) added words Minister, now to the Superintendent of
to the same effect when he said, as reported Insurance, under the amendment to this proon page 340 of Hansard:
posed legislation.
Honourable senators, I think the general public
Then the act goes on to say, in subsection
should be protected. We are told that the purpose
(3):
of the Senate is to represent the general public of
Canada, but I do not think we are protecting the
general public if we allow balance sheets to go out
which are false.
A company's assets should be
shown on its balance sheet at their true market
value, not a false value.

Well, I am sure those honourable gentlemen
were under a misapprehension as to what the
purport of this proposed amendment to section
72 of the act involves. It has nothing whatever
to do with the annual statements which these
trust companies have to make to their shareholders. It is confined solely and simply to the
annual statement which each of these companies is required to make to the minister
under this act, and which in future they will
be required to make to the Superintendent of
Insurance.
This bill does not purport to change in any
way, shape or form the content or the makeup of the financial statements which each of
these trust companies makes to its shareholders annually. That is covered in parts of
the Trust Companies Act which are not being
changed by this legislation.
I would just like to refer to one or two of
them. Section 43 (1) of the Trust Companies
Act declares this:

The report in each case shall state

(a) whether they have obtained all the information and explanations they have required; and
(b) whether in
their opinion the respective
statements are properly drawn up so as to exhibit
a true and correct view of the state of the company's affairs according to the best of their information and the explanations given to them and
as shown by the books of the company.

Now, quite

regardless

of the manner

in

which any of these trust companies might
value their securities in the annual statements which they submit to their shareholders, honourable senators who are shareholders of companies and receive the annual
statements of companies, part of whose assets
consist of marketable securities, know very
well that the auditors always insist that each
company must append to its balance sheet a
note saying "Market value"-so much. So
as far as this bill is concerned we have
nothing whatever to do with the public
statements that these trust companies have
to submit to their shareholders annually, and
I venture to submit that the shareholders are
amply protected by the auditors' report.
That being so, the only person who is apt
or likely to be misled by what my honourable
friend from Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr. RoeAn annual general meeting of the company shall
be held at its head office once in each year after buck) said was a false and misleading statethe organization of the company and the com- ment, prepared by any one of these trust
mencement of the business, and at such meeting a companies and submitted to the Superinstatement of the affairs of the company shall be

Section 72 (a) of the bill, is the SuperinYou will see there is no provision about the tendent of Insurance himself. How absurd
way in which the company shall value its can one get, honourable senators? How can
securities in its statements to its shareholders. the Superintendent of Insurance be misled

JULY 23, 1958
by the fact that dominion and provincial government securities have been shown on the
statements submitted to him by a trust company at their amortized value, when the
amendment itself requires that in addition
to showing the amortized value the company
bas also to show in schedules these same
securities at their market value? That is all
there is to this suggestion and to the-as I
think I must describe them-rather exaggerated statements about the capacity which
this bill gives to these evil trust companies
to make false and misleading statements
about their financial position.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: May I ask a question?
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Certainly.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: Is it not the case that
the amortization values of securities applies
only to federal bonds and provincial bonds
that are not in default?
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: That is right.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: If they are in default
they have to be shown in the statement at
their market value at that time; and all
other securities, industrial and so on, must
also be shown in the statement at market
value?
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: My honourable friend
is perfectly correct; that is the situation.
This permission to show these securities in
this particular form is confined simply to
federal Government securities, provincial
Government securities, and securities guaranteed by the federal Government or by
a provincial Government which have a
term. In other words, they have to mature
at a certain date.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: And they must be
securities which are not in default?
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Securities which are
not in default.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: So the instance of Alberta
cited by my honourable friend from TorontoTrinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck) would not apply
in this case?
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Oh, no.
Honourable senators, I was much impressed, as I think the whole bouse was impressed, by the speech made the other day
by the honourable senator from Gulf <Hon.
Mr. Power). In effect, what he said to us
was this: What is the public interest in
this legislation; how does the public derive
any advantage from this legislation, and
should we not consider the interests of the
public as a whole rather than the interests
of these few trust companies which are to
be affected by this bill? Well, that is a

pretty fair question. Of course, I agree that
the primary consideration of every one of us
is the public interest. But let us be practical
about this. Ninety-nine out of every 100
members of the public have no concern whatsoever with the Trust Companies Act of
the Dominion of Canada. The people who
are primarily concerned with the act, who
are governed by it, and who, as my honourable friend from Toronto-Trinity said, are
subject to severe penalties for infringement
of it, are the trust companies themselves.
So I think that instead of asking the rather
general question which my honourable
friend from Gulf asked as to the publie
interest in this bill, the questions we should
ask ourselves are, first: Is there anything
in this bill which is contrary to the public
interest? and, secondly: If we find nothing
contrary to the public interest, isn't there
something in the bill that the people who
are subject to it are in favour of and which
we can properly grant to them?
Hon. Mr. Power: Will the honourable
gentleman permit a question?
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Yes.
Hon. Mr. Power: Have not the people who
lend money to these companies-that is, the
depositors-any interest in the legislation
which governs the companies?
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Oh, yes.
Hon. Mr. Power: Well, I would say they
comprise a very much larger number of
people than do the people who are interested
primarily in the management of these
companies.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: I quite agree with my
honourable friend from Gulf, and I say that
the interests of the depositors are part of
the public interest which we have to consider, and if we believe their interests are
going to be prejudiced by anything we might
do here, we should not do it.
Hon. Mr. Power: The only reason for this
legislation then, should be to protect the
interest of the general public. My whole contention was that no word or evidence had
been given as to the rights and advantages
the general public is going to get from this
legislation.
That was the whole of my
argument.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Well, after all, I suppose it is only fair to say that if Parliament
bas enacted a Trust Companies Act and set
up an official, as it bas done in the person
of the Superintendent of Insurance, to police
this act on behalf of the general public
who are likely to be affected by it, then
we should be governed very largely in our
consideration of the benefits or otherwise of

SENATE
this measure by what the Superintendent of
Insurance says to us; and I point out to my
honourable friend that we had the Superintendent of Insurance as a witness before
the committee for a period of about four
hours one day last week.
My honourable friend the senator who preceded me (Hon. Mr. White) said that the
Government had no objection to sending this
bill back to the Standing Committee on Banking and Commerce for further consideration.
If that be so, of course 1, as a private member on the Opposition side, would not object
either, though had my honourable friend not
made that statement I was fully prepared
to vote against the amendment moved by the
honourable senator from De la Durantaye
(Hon. Mr. Pouliot), because for the life of
me I cannot see what enlightenment we
could get from a further meeting of that
committee other than the enlightenment that
we did get at a long and quite difficult meeting which extended for two hours one morning and another hour and a half in the
afternoon of the same day after the Senate
adjourned.
I felt after that meeting was over that the
Standing Committee on Banking and Commerce had received all the information that
was necessary to enable it to form an intelligent judgment on the merits or demerits
of this measure. And, as I say, I do not
see what further use can be served by holding
another meeting.
I must here interpose perhaps a word to
my honourable friend from Toronto-Spadina
(Hon. Mr. Croll). He, by implication at least,
criticized the action of the committee when
he said that the chairman of the committee
ought ta have seen that others interested
were invited to appear and give evidence
before it. Well, when the committee met that
morning I attended as an ordinary member,
and much to my surprise I was then and
there elected Acting Chairman, in the absence
of the permanent Chairman. Of course, I had
no opportunity of any kind ta see that further
evidence was forthcoming. And again, I do
not know what further evidence would be of
value or of utility ta the house. My honourable friend suggested that some of the labour
unions might be called. What in the world
could they contribute? Another suggestion
was that perhaps the Canadian Chamber of
Commerce might be called. Well I do not
know that it would have anything much to
say. This to me is primarily a matter between
the Government and Parliament on the one
hand, as represented by the Superintendent
of Insurance, and on the other hand those
trust companies which are subject to the provisions of the bill.

I have no objection to any one else coming
before the Standing Committee on Banking
and Commerce and expressing views on this
bill, but to my honourable friend from
Toronto-Spadina who says that people have
been taken by surprise and that there has
not been sufficient time ta consider the bill
I point out that this is a public bill which
was introduced for first reading on the 8th
of July. There have been practically three
weeks for any person in any part of the
country who had any views to express on
this bill to write to the Chairman of Committees or in some other way to communicate
a desire to express views on this bill. So
far as I am aware there have been no such
communications of any kind.
I am afraid I have taken too much of
the time of the house. In view of the Government's willingness to have the bill referred back to committee, I have no objection
to that procedure, but I take the view now,
which the great majority of the committee
took at the conclusion of the hearing last
week, that it is really a bill of minor importance, that if does confer some slight benefit
on some of these trust companies, and that
there is no valid reason in the world why it
should not be passed in its present form.
Hon. Gustave Monette: Honourable senators, may I add a word on the matter now
before us?
I admit there may be some confusion in
honest minds, but the answer to the question raised lies, I believe, in subsections 3
and 4 of section 7 2 A, quoted by the honourable senator who spoke last. Subsection 4
of that section requires the annual statement
of every company concerned to be deposited
in the department. Thus, a public statement from every one of these companies
would be on deposit with the department.
Subsection 3 of section 72 A reads:
The securities owned by a company or held
in respect of guaranteed trust moneys shall be
taken into account in every annual statement at
values that, in total, do not exceed the aggregate
of-

Let me stop there and say that these securities are to be shown in every annual statement at their values. And what are they?
(a) the amortized values of redeemable securities not in defaut, issued or guaranteed by the
Government of Canada or by the Government of
any province of Canada, and(b) the market values of all securities other
than those described in paragraph (a).

That means that only the securities mentioned in paragraph (a), that is, those guaranteed by the Government of Canada or by
a province, shall be taken at the amortized
value, rather than at the market value,

JULY 23, 1958
provided they are not in default. And being
guaranteed by the Canadian Government or
a provincial Government, they are certain
to be paid. That would seem to be sufficient
to provide a clear and adequate guarantee
for the protection of those interested. But
subsection 4 of the same section goes on
to say this:
Every annual statement required by this act to be
deposited in the department shall show in schedules
the market values of all securities owned by the
company or held in respect of guaranteed trust
moneys at the date of the statement.
That is, paragraphs (a) and (b) of subsection 3 provide that securities guaranteed
by the dominion Government or a provincial
Government shall be shown at their amortized values, and all other securities at their
market values. As a further precaution subsection 4 requires that every statement submitted to the department shall show the
market values of all securities of whatever
kind.
So, honourable senators, anyone desiring
to know the market value of all the securities
owned by a trust company or held by it in
respect of quaranteed trust moneys can
obtain that information from the company's
annual statements. And again I point out
that amortized values shall be taken into
account only in the case of securities guaranteed or issued by the federal Government
or any of the provincial Governments, and
provided they are not in default.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: That is right.
Hon. A. Neil McLean: The honourable
senator from Inkeiman (Hon. Mr. Hugessen)
bas referred to what I said the other day
about false balance sheets. As honourable
senators know, on any balance sheet the
assets are set out and added up, the liabilities
are set out and added up, and what is left
over is the surplus in the company. Now if
the value is taken as the amortized value and
it is beyond the market value, that shows a
false balance sheet. The assets just aren't
there, and they won't be there for liquidation,
or if the company sells out.
I spoke to the Superintendent of Insurance
and asked him what was the policy of his
department. He told me, "We have always
been against amortized values." That was
the policy of his department. Therefore, if we
put through this bill allowing amortized
values, we shall be allowing false balance
sheets. I would repeat that again and again:
you add up the assets, add up the liabilities,
and subtract one from the other if you want
to know the true valuation of the surplus.
But when you put in the amortized value
you get a false valuation. If the amortized

value is higher than the market value, you
cannot sell at the amortized value.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: May I ask my honourable friend if he has reference to the annual
statement that these companies furnish to
the superintendent or to the annual statement they furnish to their shareholders?
Hon. Mr. McLean: Every company I am
connected with gets out quarterly statements,
and revises them when necessary. I happen
to be in the fish business, and if our statement that went out at the end of March does
not coincide with what was shown on the
statement at the end of December, we put in
the true value.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: I am not interested in
the price of fish; I am only informing the
honourable senator that whatever rights these
companies have with respect to the balance
sheets which they furnish to their shareholders and the public are not affected one
way or the other by this bill.
Hon. Mr. McLean: They certainly are. If
a company bas to go into liquidation it is
not going to realize on the amortized value;
it has to realize on the market value.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: The honourable senator
from Southern New Brunswick (Hon. Mr.
McLean) referred to a reply he got to a
question put to Mr. MacGregor, the Superintendent of Insurance. My understanding
of what the superintendent said was that the
departnent over which he is supervisor receives the market value figures as well as
the amortized value figures and therefore is
cognizant at all times of the position of every
trust company that comes under his supervision.
Hon. Hartland DeM. Molson: Honourable
senators, I did not intend to say anything
on this bill, but I feel, with some of the
senators who have spoken, that there certainly is a great deal of confusion.
Like the honourable senator from Inkerman
(Hon. Mr. Hugessen), I attended the meeting
of the committee which dealt with this bill,
and I felt that the bill was quite a reasonable
one. I did not then know that it was a
sinister bill; nor did I know that there were
insiders, perhaps directors of trust companies,
who were spending their time working out
angles so that they could make prodigious
sums of money at the expense of the public.
I take my duties in the Senate as seriously,
I think, as any other senator does. I feel
that I am representing not any group or
class, but a certain small section of the
public. As Parliament creates corporations,
I would assume that Parliament is the only

SENATE

body that can amend the acts under which
these corporations have their existence.
I am fully cognizant that I am following
after some of the greatest and most eloquent
orators we have in this house. I am also
extremely conscious that I am not a member
of the bar, and that therefore my ability
to plead a cause may suffer by comparison.
It seems to me that in imputing motives to
some unknown parties that have not been connected with this bill we are not acting in the
best interests of either the Senate or the
public. In the course of his remarks the honourable senator from Toronto Spadina (Hon.
Mr. Croll) dealt with the amendment which
enabled life insurance companies to become
mutualized. He said that the insiders-I
think that was his term-made a killing. He
named two insurance companies, perhaps
three, whose directors I do not happen to
know. I do not know who the insiders would
be. I do not believe he would imply that
they were the directors of those insurance
companies. But I am a director of one of
the life insurance companies he named, the
Sun Life Assurance Company of Canada,
whose stock he said went up from $205 to
$325 in about four months. The first thing
I have to say in that respect is that I think
the honourable senator is wrong.
Hon. Mr. Croll: I took the figures from the
financial statement. Would you like me to
send the statement to you?
Hon. Mr. Molson: I would appreciate any
information you have, but I still say I think
you are wrong.
Hon. Mr. Croll: I will be glad to send it
to you.
Hon. Mr. Molson: In the second case, I
think the directors of those companies-I
can't speak for all companies-do not make
a practice of putting themselves in jeopardy
by going out and buying the stock of the
companies of which they are directors in
order to make a quick deal. I would like,
therefore, to dissociate myself entirely from
the remark made by the honourable senator
from Toronto-Spadina (Hon. Mr. Croll)
as regards the directors of insurance companies.
Our Canadian insurance companies have a
very good record; they are respected and
have an enviable standing throughout the
world. There should be no implications in
this chamber that these companies are run
by people who coax the Government into
letting them be mutualized in order to make
a quick deal. So much for that.
With regard to the bill itself-and I am
not associated with any of these companies
as a shareholder or director in any way at

all-I would say that the effect of the proposed amendment is to put the companies in
the same position as the insurance companies
and the banks have already been put in by
the Government.
I quite agree with the honourable senator
from Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck)
that because a thing was allowed to be done
once is no argument that it should happen
again. In fact, like the honourable senator
from Gulf (Hon. Mr. Power)-and as I think
the Superintendent of Insurance said about
himself-actually I have always been a
market-value person. I do think that the true
value is better demonstrated by taking securities at their market value rather than at
their amortized value. But a great many of
the members of this bouse have voted for
legislation that made amortized values effective for banks and for insurance companies.
It seems to me that it is rather late in the
day to pick on these trust companies-I think
there were ten of them-which are not the
biggest trust companies in Canada. The bigger trust companies are incorporated under
provincial statute, and, apparently, according
to the Superintendent of Insurance, they are
already carrying out the procedure proposed
in this bill. So unless I am mistaken it would
appear that we are seizing the wrong medium
for trying to re-establish a principle. We are
really locking the door of the stable. After
the proceedings in committee, I personally
could not vote to return this bill to committee. I do not consider it necessary to do
so, but I can assure honourable senators that
if I felt there was any danger to any public
interest I would be most happy to have the
bill referred back to committee for re-examination. Sometimes we may hurry legislation
through, but as a rule legislation gets good
and careful consideration in our committees
and in this house. I do not feel that any
legislation should be hurried. Perhaps this
was handled a bit hastily, but to my mind
the amendments are not important and therefore, the bill having been dealt with by the
committee in what seemed to be a reasonable
way, I will not vote to have it returned to
the committee now.
Hon. William M. Wall: Honourable senators, we have had a very fruitful and brilliant
discussion on the problem of amortized valuation. I must admit that I am concerned with
the principle to the extent that there is a
linear relationship between this change in the
bill and section 10 of the act. As honourable
senators may recall, section 10 has to do
with planned amortized valuation of both a
company's funds and the guaranteed funds
that are received by a company for reinvestment. The amendment to section 10 changes
the multiplier from 10 times to 122 times the

JULY 23, 1958
amount of the unimpaired paid-up capital
stock and reserve of the company. I must
admit I found it difficult to assess the pros
and cons of this change with respect to the
multiplier. In the historical context, when
the federal legislation was introduced in 1914
the restriction was fixed at five times. I have
read the Commons Hansard very carefully,
and in 1931 the restriction was changed to
seven times, which was a 40 per cent increase.
I might say that in the ather house the full
discussion on the amendment of 1931 took
only 25 or 26 Unes of Hansard.
In 1947 the multiplier of seven times was
changed to the present multiplier of 10 times,
and now we are being asked to increase it
to 124 times. If there is an error in the
amortization principle introduced by this bill,
then that error is compounded by 124 times
when we try to arrive at the aggregate sum
of moneys borrowed or moneys entrusted to
either the loan companies or the trust companies for reinvestment purposes.
I understand that the trust companies
requested this relaxation of the 10-times
ratio, and this is also being accorded to the
loan companies, to be effected by bylaw, in
another bill now before the Senate. This will
enable them to receive more deposits or issue
more debenture loans. In other words, it will
enable them to do more reinvestment business
without-and I want to stress this-increasing
their paid-up capital. To me the crux of the
problem is this: has the case been proved
that it is the multiplier that should be
changed? Or should more capital be raised
in order to meet the needs of reinvestment?
A reference to the last annual report issued
by the Department of Insurance on loan and
trust companies discloses the relationship of
the paid-up capital and surplus vis-a-vis the
total amount of business transacted by the
companies. It also shows, for example, that
the paid-up capital of the ten trust companies
in 1956 was about $17.3 million, an increase
of roughly $2 million over what it was in
1955, with a possible authorized paid-up
capital of, I believe, $33 or $34 million. In
effect, one could argue that there is room
for increasing the deposit and reinvestment
business of both the loan and trust companies
by ircreasing their capitalization. The question before me is this: to meet a growing
public need for this kind of service, has a
good case been made to Parliament for
narrowing the existing protective margin by
increasing the 10-times multiplier to 124
times, as opposed to increasing the capital
structure of the trust companies and loan
companies?
Basing their claim on successful responsible
reinvestment experience, I am told that the
trust companies requested-that this multiplier

be increased to 15. This would mean that the
protective margin would be 100 divided by 15,
which gives you 6.67 per cent. When you
realize that the company funds from which
you begin this ratio, and the guaranteed
funds, would both be subjected to a change
in value, the net protective margin would
probably be around 6 per cent.
We were told that the Superintendent of
Insurance felt he was unable to agree to this
15-times multiplier, regarding a margin of
safety of approximately 6 per cent as being
less satisfactory from the public point of view
than the 121-times multiplier that he was
prepared to accept and recommend to Parliament.
This new multiplier gives us an effective
protective margin of about 74 per cent, which
is deemed adequate. I know something about
market value fluctuations of securities in
which these guaranteed funds of trust companies would be invested, and it appears we
must make a judgment concerning the multiplier that will result in a required percentage
protective margin to be maintained by statute.
Is it to be the present 10 times, which gives
a margin of about 9 per cent; the suggested
124 times, which gives a margin of about
74 per cent; or, in fact, the originally
requested margin of 15 times, which gives a
margin of about 6 per cent? We must keep
in mind the apparent fact that what is done
at the federal level by statutory prescription
will have a normative effect upon the operation of provincially-incorporated companies.
I think that is very significant and important.
Quite frankly, there appears to be no effective mathematical yardstick by which one is
able to judge the relative security of this
protective margin. Is 6 per cent to 74 per
cent a good margin? I do not know, but being
cautious I tend to say, "Well, 10 times has
been a good margin, let us leave it at 10,
if we are going to change the principle of
market valuation to amortized valuation."
However, the Department of Insurance has
agreed to the increase, and the Government
accepts its recommendation by advancing the
bill, and through the department the Government accepts responsibility for the effective operation, I think, of this new stated
margin.
Now I come to this final observation, which
I think is pertinent: If Parliament, honourable senators, has an obligation to relax these
particular statutory provisions, to help the
trust companies and the loan companies to
meet what are additional demands and opportunities for reinvestment services, then the
converse of this obligation is equally true,
namely, that the judicious utilization of this
new multiplier by trust and loan companies
should go hand in hand with, and perhaps

Hon. Mr. Aselline: Honourable senators,Hon. Vincent Dupuis: Honourable senators,
I do not intend to say much. As a matter
of fact, I do not wish to discuss the principle
of the bill at all. My only purpose in rising
is to express my opinion as to the advisability
of giving our unanimous consent to the motion to send the bill to committee again for
the purpose of studying it more thoroughly.
I think by so doing we would be proving to
the public that in a case of this kind a great
deal of consideration is being given to the
views of those members who oppose the bill,
such as the honourable member from TorontoTrinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck), the honourable
member from Toronto-Spadina (Hon. Mr.
Croll), my good friend from Gulf (Hon. Mr.
Power) and others. They may be right or
wrong, but their opinions deserve great consideration.
Honourable senators, I think the bill deserves further study, and I would submit
very humbly, as a member of this honourable
house, that we should agree to sending it
to committee again, especially in view of the
fact that the very distinguished member from
Hastings-Frontenac (Hon. Mr. White), speaking for the Government, has said he has no
objection to this course.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, it is moved by the Honourable Senator
Aseltine, seconded by the Honourable Senator
Quinn, that Bill S-11, intituled "An Act to

moved by the Honourable Senator Pouliot,
seconded by the Honourable Senator Croll,
that this bill be not now read the third time,
but that it be referred back to the Standing
Committee on Banking and Commerce for
further consideration. Is it your pleasure to

Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Do I understand
that in Mr. Speaker's opinion the contents

The Hon. the Speaker: Yes.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: His Honour did not
call for contents and non-contents.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: He does not have

The Hon. the Speaker: I asked if there
was a request for a vote and I understood
there was not. Since there is a request for
a vote now, I ask those in favour of the
amendment to rise and say "Content", and
those opposed to rise and say "Non-content".
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Mr. Speaker, I believe the procedure in the Senate is, first,
for Mr. Speaker to ask who are contents
and who are non-contents. He then declares
which in his opinion have the majority.
Then if the house wants to have a recorded
vote it is necessary for at least two senators
to rise and ask for the vote to be recorded.
That has not been done as yet.

The Hon. the Speaker: If there is no
request for a vote, the motion carries.

Supreme Court of Ontario and Her Majesty's

of the close of the session. It is hoped that
this session will end some time early in
August. As I say, in past sessions we have
always passed a motion of this kind. At any
rate, every year during the 24 years that
I have been here this motion has been introduced at about this period of the session. I do
not think I need to say anything further in
regard to the matter, unless honourable senators have some questions.
Hon. Mr. Croll: I was in doubt about the
motion, but on the honourable leader's assertion that the session will end in a couple of
weeks I will vote for it.

Hon. W. Ross Macdonald: Honourable senators, the Leader of the Government (Hon.
Mr. Aseltine) has informed the house that
Parliament is likely to be prorogued within
the next two or three weeks. I see there is
considerable legislation still on the Order
Paper of the other house. Probably the
Leader of the Government here can tell us
before this motion carries whether the Government intends to proceed with all that
legislation and also with other legislation
which was referred to in the Speech from
the Throne and has not yet been brought
down. We should have some information as
to what legislation remains for us to consider, and I think the honourable leader
should give it to us before asking us to pass
this motion on his statement that the house
is likely to adjourn within the next two or
three weeks.
Honourable senators, I would have no
objection to the passing of this motion at
this time, but I am sure the Leader of the

I have two requests of the Leader of the
Government: one is to tell us what legislation we can expect, and the other is that he
do not ask us to pass legislation through this
house hastily.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: I regret that I am unable to answer the first question, other than
to say that I understand that all the legislation which is at present on the Orders of the
Day in the other place will eventually come
to this chamber.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Within two or three
weeks?
Hon. Mr. Aselline: Well, during the last
few days we have received five or six bills,
and I understand that commencing next week
bills will come to us more frequently than
they have in the past. I regret that I have
no further information, but I will make inquiries and try to inform the house at the
next sitting what legislation is in prospect
before prorogation. Of course, I am not
making a definite statement that Parliament
will prorogue on any certain date but I am
hoping it will prorogue within approximately
the time I have mentioned.
Hon. A. K. Hugessen: I wonder if the
Leader of the Government (Hon. Mr. Aseltine)
could inform us when he expects the bill in
connection with the taxation of estates is
likely to come before this house. I understand that it is pretty well through in the
other place.
Hon. Mr. Asel±ine: It is at present before
the Committee on Banking and Commerce of
the other house, but I do not know how
many meetings that committee will hold on
the bill.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: I was informed this
morning that the committee had practically
completed consideration of the bill.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: I understood it would
be about six days from the time the bill
went to the committee until it came to us,
so we shall probably receive it next week.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Honourable senators,
may I be permitted to ask another question?
At the present time the other bouse is considering a bill to provide for the resumption
of the British Columbia Coast Steamship
Service, operated by the Canadian Pacific
Railway Company. Can the honourable Leader
of the Government give us any idea as to
when this house may expect that bill, if it
passes the other house? Also, what are his
proposals as to further sittings of the Senate
this week?
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Honourable senators,
I expect that bill to pass through the other

house in time to be received by us for first
reading some time today. The resolution stage
was passed and the bill received first reading
last night, and I understand it is now in
process of being given second reading.
With respect to further sittings of the
Senate this week, I hope that before we conclude our work this afternoon we may have
information as to when we shall receive the
bill to which my honourable friend referred.
If we do not have information by that time
I will then propose that we adjourn during
pleasure, to meet at the call of the bell at
approximately 6 o'clock. If at that hour there
is no prospect of our receiving the bill today,
I will ask the house to adjourn until tomorrow. The Prime Minister has announced
that it is his hope and that of the Government that the steamships will be brought
into operation not later than Saturday of
this week.
Hon. T. A. Crerar: Honourable senators,
there are a few comments I wish to make
upon the motion now before us.
I suspect that the bringing forward of this
motion is not unrelated to the matter presently being discussed in the other place,
which seems to come into the category of
emergency legislation. I dislike to have to
disagree with my good friend the honourable
Leader of the Government forces in this
house, but we have already, on three occasions since the opening of this session, had
to deal with so-called emergencies, and in
each case we waived certain rules in response to the earnest pleas of the leader in
order that he might proceed with these different pieces of legislation.
I have no objection personally to facilitating in every way possible the bill now under
consideration in the other place. But at this
stage of the session, when we do not know
how long the session may last, when a substantial number of bills are on the Order
Paper of the other place and additional bills
will probably be brought in there, I object
most definitely to the Senate giving the bonourable leader here carte blanche to push any
of these bills through this house in a hurry.
That is not the way this chamber should conduct its business. If the purpose of suspending the rules as proposed in the motion is to
expedite through this bouse the emergency
legislation in respect of the British Columbia
steamship service, I would have no objection
to it; but I do definitely object to giving a
carte blanche for all legislation that may
come along. We may be sitting until the end
of October. We do not know when the session
will end.
It is quite true that in the past motions
of this kind have been brought forward, but
always, so far as my recollection goes, when

JULY 24, 1958
the legisiation te be considered was on the
Order Paper in the other place, and then
when it was of very lirnited extent. In the
past such a motion applied more to financial
and supply resolutions than to anything else.
I do flot like this surrender--and it is a
surender--of the rights cf this bouse in a
state of affairs when we do flot yet know
what legisiation is to corne to us. I protest
against it. I suggest ini ail good temper to
the Leader of the Governrnent that he secure
permission of the house to deal with this
particular piece of legisiation that is coming
through, and I arn sure he will get it without
any reservation. But an open engagement
applicable to ail legisiation, some of which is
cornpletely hldden frorn us and has yet to
be unfolded, is, 1 think, a littie too rnuch to
ask of this honourable house.
Hon. Gray Turgeon: Honourable senators,
as one who cornes from British Columbia may
I say a word on this matter? British Columbians have for sorne time been awaiting action
by the Government in connecetion with the
strike that has new been going on for more
than two months. In the circumstances I hope
that no action will be taken by this house
that might delay for one day, or even haif a
day, the passing of the proposed legisiation
when it reaches this chamber. I arn of the
opinion that, with the unanimeus consent cf
this charnber, this ernergency legislation could
receive three readings here in one day. If
that could be done, perhaps this motion would
net be required. In any event, I sincerely
hope, on behalf of the people of British
Columbia, that ne action will be taken in
this house that will cause delay in the passage
cf this bill.
Mon. Mr. Aseltin.: Henourable senators,
may I say in reply to the remarks made by
the honourable senator frem, Churchill (Hon.
Mr. Crerar) that when I prepared this motion
I did net know about the legisiatien in connection with the British Columbia strike.
Mon. Mr. Crerar: Thon the motion is ail the
more reprehiensible.
Hon. Mr. Aseitine: It bas been the usual
thing to present this motion at this stage of
every session. I discussed the matter with
certain people before deciding te bring in the
motion. If honourable senators do not want
to pass it, that is ail right.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: Honourable senators,
with reference to the remarks made by rny

could possibly give te any legisiation that rnay
come before us this session. Therefore, I
would hesitate very rnuch to commit myself
te any stipulation that the bill would pass ini

and inquiry.

SENATE
The agreement follows the pattern established in the present income tax agreements
which Canada has made with the United
States of America, the United Kingdom,
Sweden, New Zealand, Ireland, Denmark,
France, the Federal Republic of Germany,
South Africa, the Netherlands, and Australia,
and has as its purpose the avoidance of
double taxation and the exchange of information. By these treaties the agreeing countries
codify the rules they will follow in taxing
income earned in one country by persons
residing in the other. This gives a degree of
certainty to business enterprises of one
country carrying on business in the other,
and it helps to remove some of the uncertainty which prospective investors and
business firms considering an expansion of
their field of operations into the other
country might otherwise have.
It is common in these agreements for each
country to bind the rate of tax it will apply
on investment income such as dividends,
interest and royalties going to residents of the
other country. All these agreements contain
a provision by which each country agrees
to limit its taxation of the industrial and
commercial profits-what one might call the
profits from carrying on business-of an

the system obtaining in Belgium and those
under the systern obtaining in Canada.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: I am not sure to what
extent my honourable friend wishes to obtain information. Does he wish to obtain a
comparison of the whole income tax structure in Belgium with our income tax
structure here?
Hon. Mr. Connolly: No, I am only interested in the general lines-for instance, the
comparative corporate rates in the two countries, and some general idea also of what
the personal rates are in Belgium as compared with those in Canada.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: I am not sure that I can
answer the question to the honourable
gentleman's satisfaction, but I will see what

I can do a little later on.
I was saying, honourable senators, that
naturally the wording of each agreement will
vary to some degree because of the difference

The agreement confirms the right of
Canada to withhold a tax of 15 per cent at
the source on dividends, interest, royalties,
and rents arising in Canada and paid to a
resident of Belgium. It also provides that
this rate shall be reduced to 5 per cent on
dividends paid by a subsidiary company in
Canada to a parent company in Belgium
which owns at least 50 per cent of the shares
of the Canadian subsidiary company. This
is in contrast to the general law of Canada
which provides that in order to be entitled
to this reduced 5 per cent rate all the shares
of the Canadian company must be owned
by the non-resident company. The provision found in this agreement covering this
reduced rate on dividends where there is
more than 50 per cent ownership is similar
to the present agreement between Canada
and the United States of America.
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): I wonder if the honourable gentleman is right in
that statement. I thought that under the
present Canadian law the withholding tax is
5 per cent when it is paid by a Canadian
subsidiary to an American parent or to a
foreign parent when 51 percent of the shares
are owned by the foreign parent.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: The information I
received from the officials of the department
is as I have given it, but I shall look into
the matter and I may obtain more information on that point. I have here a summary
of all of the articles in the agreement, a
quite extensive and complicated summary,
which I hope I shall not have to go into in
detail today.
Hon. Calvert C. Prati: I think the information may be found in article VI of the agreement in the bill.
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa Westi: I should
say to the honourable leader that I apologize
for interrupting like this, but sometimes it
facilitates consideration of a bill to have
questions answered as we go along, particularly on a Thursday afternoon, when perhaps we are not so rushed as usual. Now,
my memory may be at fault, and it may be
that I am thinking of one of the earlier
agreements in which the 5 per cent rule
applies, but it does seem to me that within
the last year or so an amendment was made,
to the income tax act whereby as between
parent and subsidiary the witholding tax
was 5 per cent.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: I refer my honourable
friend to article VI, paragraph 2, which
deals with that point. .It reads as follows:

in the tax systems from country to country
and the desire of some countries to cover
certain matters in more detail. However, the
general statement can be made that this
agreement between Canada and Belgium follows the same pattern and principles found
in the agreements between Canada and the
other countries that I have mentioned.
Before I go further, I want to point out
that the agreement to be considered covers
only taxes on income in each country.
The description of the Belgian taxes covered by the agreement will be found in
article I(b). The description may look odd
in an agreement dealing only with income
taxes since these Belgian taxes do not use
the words "income taxes" in any of their
titles. Nevertheless, all these taxes are taxes
which are levied on income in Belgium. The
income taxes in Belgium are known as the
real property tax, the movable capital tax,
the professional tax, the national crisis contribution, and the complementary personal
tax. They are all income taxes.
After listing the taxes to be covered and
providing a number of definitions, the agreement proceeds to provide that a Belgian
enterprise will only be taxed in Canada, with
respect to industrial or commercial profits,
to the extent that these are attributable to
its permanent establishment in Canada. The
same ruling applies reciprocally with respect
to the industrial and commercial profits of
Canadian enterprise in Belgium. Each country is given the right to correct accounts
where associated companies or persons of
the two countries deal with each other on
terms different than would have been the

to a group comprising the said company and a
maximum of three other companies resident in
Belgium of which each owns at least 10 per cent of
the said shares, the rate of Canadian tax will be
reduced to 5 per cent with respect to the dividends
paid in that year by the Canadian company to
the Belgian companies.

Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa Wes±): Yes, I
think so. I think it is also in the Canadian
Income Tax Act, but I may be wrong.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Later on we shall be
able to get that information.
This convention which we hope to ratify
also provides that profits from the operation
of ships and aircraft shall be taxed only in
the country of residence notwithstanding the
fact that part of the profits might arise in
the other country. That applies to the sale
of tickets also. It also says that the income
of a teacher or business apprentice from one
of the countries who is present in the other
for a limited period will be free of tax in
the country where he is temporarily residing.
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): Will the
honourable gentleman say for how long a
period?
Hon. Mr. Aselline: For 180 days, I believe.
That is for the purpose of fostering cultural
interest between the two countries.
Honourable senators, as I have mentioned,
the agreement provides for the avoidance of
double taxation by tax credits or their equivalent. Belgium has no tax credit provision in
its law comparable to that found in Canada,
and so this agreement provides a method by
which tax imposed by Canada is to be taken
into account when computing tax on a resident
of Belgium who is in receipt of income from
Canadian sources.
All the other provisions of the agreement
are very similar to those that are found in
the tax agreements that I have mentioned
with other countries and will be familiar to
honourable members of the Senate.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: Has the honourable
leader any information that would indicate
a comparison of the interests of Canada in
Behgium with the interests of Belgium in
Canada which would naturally be affected
by this convention, that is, in terms of volume
of business? For instance, there comes to
my mind that very enterprising and extensive
industry of which we see evidence along the
highways these days-gasoline filling stations
-and I am wondering if this convention
could in any way be equated as regards the
benefits that accrue to each country. In other
words, is there any measure of equality? If

Hon. Mr. Aseltine: I would have to give
that information on third reading, unless the
bill is referred to a committee, in which event
the officials of the departrnent will be there
to answer any of these questions on matters
with which I am not familiar.
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): Honourable senators, I would like to say just a few
words in connection with this bill and the
treaty which is attached to it as a schedule.
I do think that the general principle embodied in this measure is a particularly good
type of legislation to have in this country.
For many years to come-for many generations to come, I hope-we shall continue to
have natural resources and other resources
to be exploited, and much of the capital for
the enterprises will, I am afraid, have to come
from abroad. Perhaps I should not say that
I am afraid of this, for I think it is a good
thing to have capital from various countries
invested in various enterprises in this country.
Canada is basically a country which must
depend for its continued prosperity upon
expansion of its trade and development of
markets abroad, and the more that we interest
foreign capital in opportunities for investment here, the more solid will be our future
trading relations. For a number of years, and
particularly since the end of the last war,
the tendency has been to enter into conventions like this between Canada and the other
great trading nations of the world, and I hope
the trend will continue, because if it does
it will make investment in Canada more
attractive for foreign capital; and the confidence of foreign investors in Canada will
encourage Canadians to invest their own
savings in the development of our resources.
The questions that I was asking the honourable leader-and I again apologize for
interrupting a speech which, as it deals with
a technical subject, is perhaps difficult to
make-were of the type usually raised on
the consideration of a convention of this
kind. I do not think it is necessary to send
this bill to a committee. Perhaps the honourable leader can get some of the answers from
the Income Tax division of the National
Revenue Department or from the Department

SENATE
CANADA-BELGIAN CONGO INCOME TAX
CONVENTION BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. W. M. Aselline moved the second
reading of Bill C-29, to implement a convention between Canada and Belgium for the
purpose of extending to the Belgian Congo
and the Territory of Ruanda-Urundi under
Trusteeship the convention between Canada
and Belgium for the avoidance of double
taxation with respect to income taxes.
He said: Honourable senators, this is a
sister bill to the one to which we have just
given second reading. The purpose of this
bill is to give legal effect in Canada to the
agreement between Canada and Belgium
extending to the Belgian Congo and the Territory of Ruanda-Urundi, which is held under
trusteeship, the agreement between Canada
and Belgium which we have just been discussing under Bill C-28.
May I say, honourable senators, that the
usual procedure is that a treaty of this kind
will be extended to cover the colonies of an
agreeing country merely by an exchange of
notes. However, the Belgian Constitution
is such that it does not allow this to be
done, and the Belgian representatives made
it clear at the time of negotiations that there
must be a separate treaty for the Congo.
The substance of both agreements is the
same, but to extend the Canadian-Belgian
convention it is necessary to replace certain
provisions contained therein with new provisions which are applicable to the taxes
imposed by the Belgian Congo and RuandaUrundi. The explanation of these amendments is briefly as follows:
Article I to the agreement attached to Bill
C-29 contains specific reference to the
respective taxes to which the extended convention applies. In Canada it applies to
income taxes, including surtax, and in the
Belgian Congo and Ruanda-Urundi it applies
to the taxes on rental income, movable
capital tax, professional tax, complementary
tax, all of which taxes are now imposed by
the Belgian Congo and Ruanda-Urundi and
are in the nature of income tax. It also
provides that the extended convention will
apply to any substantially similar tax that
may be imposed by either Government during the time the convention is enforced.
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): Does
the honourable gentleman know if those
taxes in the Belgian Congo and RuandaUrundi, as provided in article I(b), are the
only taxes by way of income tax that are
imposed in those two territories? In other
words, are these the only tax measures in
the two territories that would tax income as
it is understood in Canada?

Hon. Mr. Aseltine: That is the way I read
article I, section 1, subsection (b).
Article II merely amends certain of the
subparagraphs contained in article II of
the Canada-Belgium Convention, which is
a general definition article, to make certain
that the definitions contained therein will
apply to the Belgian Congo and RuandaUrundi.
Articles VI, IX and XII are required in
order to delete any references to "Belgium"
or "Belgian tax" and replace them by references to "'Belgian Congo and RuandaUrundi" and to "Congolese tax" respectively.
The Congolese tax is referred to in section
1(b) to which I made reference a moment ago.
Article XIX sets out the requirements necessary to determine the convention.
Hon. John J. Connolly (Ottawa West):
Honourable senators, the honourable Leader
of the Government (Hon. Mr. Aseltine) and
I seem to be participating in a private debate
this afternoon. I do think, though, that a
little more attention might be given by the
chamber to the remarks that were made on
the previous bill by the honourable gentleman from Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck). As he said, this is not the first time
he has raised certain points in connection
with measures of this kind.
I believe all honourable senators will agree
that simplification of statute law, particularly of tax statutes, is something that this
chamber can do effective work on and, in
fact, has done effective work on. The Income
War Tax Act was revised on the initiative
of members of this chamber, including the
honourable gentleman from Toronto-Trinity
(Hon. Mr. Roebuck) and the honourable gentleman from Toronto (Hon. Mr. Campbell),
and the benefit conferred upon the people of
Canada by the revision and simplification
of that act was most commendable.
At the annual meeting of the Tax Foundation, held a little earlier this year, the executive director, who is very competent in this
field, said that the time was fast approaching
when the Income Tax Act would again have
to be revised in the interests of simplicity
and clarity. I do not want to engage in a
discussion on that broad problem, but I
do think that a Senate committee could
spend one or two sessions in considering the
problem raised by the honourable gentleman
from Toronto-Trinity, with a view to recommending to the appropriate Government
authorities that some changes be made either
in the method whereby these tax agreements
are negotiated or in the way in which they
are enacted into law by Parliament. A person
with business interests in, say, the United
States, Belgium, Ireland, or Britain, has to

JULY 24, 1958
wade through a great deal of material before
he knows his rights under the various tax
agreements. I do not suppose too many officials in the Income Tax Branch could give a
ready answer to these questions, for probably
not, many taxpayers come within the ambit
of some of these treaties. I do not imply the
treaties are unimportant, for I believe they
are extremely important, but perhaps there
is an opportunity here for a brief Senate committee inquiry to corne up with a recommendation that would go far towards
simplifying the tax law in this country, particularly in respect of these treaties.
Motion agreed to and bill read second time.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, when shall this bill be read the third
time?
Hon. Mr. Aselfine: Tuesday next.
PRIVATE BILL
STANMOUNT PIPE LINE COMPANYSECOND READING

Hon. Gunnar S. Thorvaldson moved the
second reading of Bill S-14, respecting Stanmount Pipe Line Company.
He said: Honourable senators, the Stanmount Pipe Line Company was incorporated
by chapter 78 of the Statutes of Canada, 1955.
The object of this bill is to amend that act of
incorporation in two particulars. Section 5 of
the original act of incorporation reads as
follows:
The company shall have all the powers, privileges
and immunities conferred by and be subject to all
the limitations, liabilities and provisions of the Pipe
Line Act and any other general legislation relating to pipe lines for the transportation of oil or
any liquid product or by-product thereof which is
enacted by Parliament.
The object of the first amendment is to

include natural gas in section 5 of the act. In
other words, it will give the company power
to transport natural gas, in the same way as
it has the power to transport oil under the
original act.
Section 6 of the act limits the operation of
the company to the provinces of Ontario,
Manitoba, Saskatchewan, and outside of Canada. The purpose of the proposed second
amendment is to remove the territorial limitation contained in the original act and to empower the company to construct pipe lines
throughout Canada and also without Canada.
So, honourable senators, the objects of this
bill are comparatively simple.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: May I ask the honourable gentleman if this company, which was
incorporated in 1955, is in operation in any
way?

Hon. Mr. Thorvaldson: No, this company
is not in operation in any way.
I will give very briefly the background of
this company. It was incorporated by the
incorporators whose names are in the original
act in 1955. These incorporators intended to
build a pipe line which would originate south
of the Canada-United States border in either
Montana or North Dakota and then go through
Saskatchewan, into Manitoba, and there connect up with the Interprovincial Pipe Line
Company's pipe line in Manitoba, or close
to the border of Ontario, at which point it
was proposed to transport oil into the United
States, namely, into the Minnesota area. In
other words, the original incorporators of
the act intended to take oil from Montana
through parts of Canada, that is, Saskatchewan and Manitoba, and then re-ship it into
the United States. It was found by these
incorporators that such. a project was not
feasible. As a result, the shares of the company were acquired by Imperial Oil Limited,
which is now the owner of all the shares of
Stanmount Pipe Line Company.
As I remarked in reply to the honourable
senior senator from Ottawa (Hon. Mr. Lambert), this company is not operating at the
present time. However, it is desirable, for
reasons which I will indicate, firstly, to
amend the act to include gas as well as oil,
and also to remove the territorial limitation
contained in the act. First, in regard to gas:
As is well known, gas fields are generally
found close to oil fields, and also gas is frequently found in association with oil. That
is one reason why the company desires to
have the power to transport gas as well as
oil. Another factor, of course, is that in 1955,
when the original act was enacted, gas did
not assume as great importance commercially
in Canada as it does now. That is another
reason for the desire to have the act include
transport of gas as well as of oil.
In regard to the matter of present territorial restrictions contained in the act of
incorporation, the situation with respect to
Imperial Oil Company is substantially as
follows. Recently, for instance, an oil field
was discovered a few miles west of the
Alberta boundary in British Columbia, and
it is thought likely there is an oil field in
Alberta just about ten miles east of the
British Columbia-Alberta border, and a short
distance from this field in British Columbia.
The company may want to connect these two
adjoining or adjacent fields by a pipe line,
and because such pipe line would cross a
provincial boundary they cannot do so unless
the territorial restriction at present in the act
is removed.

SENATE
Another reason for asking for this amendment is that very recently Imperial Oil Limited drilled a deep well in the province of
Prince Edward Island, which well was, however, dry. But a second well is being drilled,
and if that well is successful the company
may for instance, want to build a pipe line
from Prince Edward Island to its refinery
in Halifax. Also the company has recently
drilled five wells, unsuccessfully as it happens, in the province of Quebec, but exploration continues in that province, and if it is
successful there the company may want to
build a pipe line in that province to connect
with a refinery in another province.
Honourable senators, these are briefly some
of the reasons why the owners of this company now desire to have its act of incorporation amended as indicated in this bill.
Hon. Mr. Wall: May I ask the honourable
senator one question? Does the present owner
of Stanmount Pipe Line Company, that is,
Imperial Oil, own any other pipe line?
Hon. Mr. Thorvaldson: Yes. Imperial Oil
Company owns Imperial Pipe Lines Limited,
but I believe the business of that company is
to build what we call gathering systems. In
general, such are not interprovincial in nature;
that is, they do not have to be connected up
across provincial boundaries. But as is well
known, any company that requires to traverse
provincial boundaries must be incorporated
under Canadian statute.
Motion agreed to and bill read second time.

The present delivery quotas at the 2,071
delivery points in western Canada are as
follows: at 1,016 delivery points, 6 bushels
per acre; at 1,023 delivery points, 7 bushels
per acre; and 32 delivery points are closed,
indicating that they received a full quota.
The purpose of the bill before us is to
make some amendments to the original act.
First, as the act now stands, a farmer delivering malting barley cannot receive an advance
on his farm-stored wheat; second, a farmer
wanting to deliver wheat to an elevator with
the idea of changing it for seed grain is not
allowed to do so because that grain has to
be applied to a reduction of his cash advance.
That does not allow the farmer to exchange
any grain for seed grain. These two conditions are being rectified by the amendments
in this bill.
The third major amendment will provide
This
for consolidation of cash advances.
means that if at the end of the crop year,
which is July 31, a farmer through circumstances beyond his own control or for
any other reason is not able to pay off his
cash advance, then the unpaid balance can be
carried forward in his new quota book and
be consolidated with a new advance. He will
thus be able to obtain a full new advance in

acreage and the type of grain he is selling,

PRAIRIE GRAIN ADVANCE PAYMENTS
BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. Arthur M. Pearson moved the second

reading of Bill C-31, to amend the Prairie
Grain Advance Payments Act.
He said: Honourable senators, Bill C-31 is
an act to amend the Prairie Grain Advance
Payments Act. It will be remembered that
the act was brought into existence on November 7, 1957. Under that act farmers could
obtain cash advances on farm stored grain up
to six bushels per specified or seeded acre.
They could obtain this loan at the rate of
50 cents a bushel for wheat, 20 cents a bushel
for oats, or 35 cents a bushel for barley. This
act, apparently, has worked out fairly successfully in the western provinces. There was
a total of some $35,203,217 advanced last
winter and this spring to the farmers, and
on July 18 of this year $32,703,788, or 92.9
per cent, had been repaid.

under a permit book or otherwise, expressed in
terms of a number of bushels per specified or
seeded acre.

This new definition is required for the purposes of the amendment to subsection (2) of
section 7.
Paragraph (c) of subsection (1) of section
4 of the act is repealed and the following is
substituted therefor:

he is entitled to deliver grain;

The requirement in the present act that the

act are repealed and the following substituted

That means that the farmer can deliver malting barley which will not be considered under
his general acreage quota.
Paragraph (a) of subsection (1) of section
5 of the said act is repealed and the following
substituted therefor:

Hon. Mr. Crerar: My understanding is that
the whole country is now on at least a sixbushel quota and that in some districts it is
even higher.

Hon. Mr. Pearson: That is so. When there
is a six-bushel quota in a district and elevator
space is available, the fariner is entitled to
deliver that six-bushel quota and to discharge
his advance payment. But there is a possibility that even though there is a six-bushel
quota at some points there might be such a

Hon. Mr. Pearson: There is a certain camaraderie or understanding between the farmer
and the agent of the elevator to which he
delivers his grain; they understand each other
fairly well. Nobody is going to do anything

In other words, at the end of the crop year
if he has not been able to discharge his
advance under the previous crop year then
the money that remains unpaid will be
charged in his new quota book and will be
deducted in the usual way in the new crop
year.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: If a fariner is unable to
discharge the advance he has received, I assume it would be only because he was unable
to deliver his grain. Is that actually the case
today?
Hon. Mr. Pearson: That is the case.
57075-4-26

Hon. Mr. Pearson: I think I gave those
figures: the total amount advanced for the
three Prairie provinces was $35,203,217, of
which $32,703,788 or 92.9 per cent has been
refunded.
Hon. Mr. McDonald: Would the honourable senator tell us how that amount is
divided among the three provinces?
Hon. Mr. Pearson: The figures which I
have given are as of July 18; the figures I
am now about to give are as of July 11.
There was not quite as much refunded as of
July 11, which was one week earlier. The
figures are: for Manitoba, 11,724 producers
made application for loans; total amount
advanced, $7,112,441, of which they have
refunded $6,655,993 or 93.5 per cent. For
Saskatchewan 28,792 producers made applications for loans, total amount advanced,

application for loans; total amount advanced
$6,268,662; total amount refunded $5,282,423
or 84.2 per cent.
Hon. Mr. Wall: May I ask this question?
How does the experience of the payment of
$35 million of advances to farmers on farm
stored grain compare with the original estimate of the Government when the legislation was first introduced?
Hon. Mr. Pearson: Roughly speaking, honourable senators, I believe it is about onethird of the amount that it was felt the
farmers would use by way of cash advances.
Hon. Mr. Wall: One more question: how
does the net cost to the national treasurywhich is the net help by the Government to
the farmer-compare with the storage payments which, as I recall, amounted to some
$30 million-odd paid for storage over and
above 170 million bushels?
Hon. Mr. Pearson: I am afraid I cannot
answer that question, as I do not have the
figures before me. I may say that the only
actual loss the Government would suffer
under this legislation is the interest on $35
million, which the treasury has agreed to
absorb.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: That was loaned free of
interest, was it?
Hon. Mr. Pearson: Yes.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: May I ask the honourable senator if the amount repaid during the
past year under the Prairie Grain Advance
Payments Act was more or less than the
amount under the previous act when arrangements were made for the farmer to borrow
from the bank with Government guarantee?
I think the honouràble junior senator from
Winnipeg (Hon. Mr. Wall) asked a similar
question, but I did not catch the reply.

because I follow the weekly reports carefully. But owing to the fact that crop prospects have not been good there bas been
a bigger delivery of grain from the country
to the elevators, and therefore the amount
that is in storage and still in the farmers'
hands must be much less than a year ago.
In other words, the financial prospects in
connection with the administration of this
legislation have improved. Am I right in
assuming that?
Hon. Mr. Pearson: There has been a greater
delivery of grain in the western provinces;
in fact, there are more stations with six- and
seven-bushel quotas than there were in the
last year or the year before that. But that
situation is not due to crop failure; it is due
to the greater marketings of grain overseas.
We have got rid of more of our surplus grain
at this end of the line this year than we did
the previous year.
Hon. Mr Lambert: Would you say that at
the end of this month, which is the end of
the crop year, the annual carry-over would
be much less this year than it has been for
several years?
Hon. Mr. Pearson: From my experience,
honourable senators, and from inquiries made
this past week in western Canada, sevenbushel quotas have cleaned out most of the
grain in those areas.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: That is in the farmers'
hands?
Hon. Mr. Pearson: I think the situation is
the same throughout most of the west; there
is very littIe surplus grain in the hands of
the farmers.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: You did not get as far as
Rosetown.
Hon. Mr. Pearson: I was not speaking for
my honourable leader (Hon. Mr. Aseltine).
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: But I agree that what
the sponsor of the bill has said is true in
many districts.

moments ago was that the amount under the

JULY 24, 1958
Hon. Mr. McDonald: In all three provinces?
Hon. Mr. Pearson: In all three provinces.
I do not state that as a definite fact, however.
Hon. Mr. McDonald: Could the honourable
gentleman give us any reason why there was
not a greater demand for advance payments
to help the farmers?
Hon. Mr. Pearson: For one thing, the act
was passed rather late and the farmers had
already made arrangements with their
creditors, so there was no need for them to
go to the elevators and get advances. Another
thing, it is a new act and farmers generaily
are a little cautious and want to find out how
a thing will work out with somebody else
before they will try it themselves. At some
points there wasn't one advance payment
taken even as late as the end of December.
Hon. Mr. McDonald: I take it that considerable money was drawn from the banks
before this legislation was passed.
Hon. Mr. Pearson: I would not know.
Section 6 of the bill provides:
Section 11 of the said act is amended by adding
thereto, immediately after subsection (1) thereof,
the following subsection:
"(la) Notwithstanding subsection (1), no deduction shall be made in respect of grain delivered
by a producer under any permission given by the
board authorizing delivery of grain in order to
obtain seed."
In other words, the producer can deliver
his grain and pick up seed at the elevator.
Section 7 of the bill provides:
Section 23 of the said act is repealed and the

following substituted therefor:
"23. Notwithstanding section 11 of the Prairie
Farm Assistance Act, no levy under that act shall
be deducted from an advance payment, but for
the purposes of that act there shall be deducted
from that portion of the initial payment payable
to the recipient at the time of sale and delivery
of grain to the board a levy of two per cent of
that portion of the initial payment until the
recipient has discharged his undertaking under this
act."
That just clarifies the meaning of the
section.
Hon. T. A. Crerar: Honourable senators, my
comments on this bill will not be extensive.
I think we all know the history of these free
cash advances to farmers who have grain on
their farms, the advances being interest free
and to be repaid when the farmers deliver
their grain. That was one of the strong arguments made by the present Prime Minister
prior to the election in 1957. It was the argument advanced by his party in the House of
Commons in opposition to the method adopted
by the previous Government, which was to
provide cash advances through the banks in
the normal banking procedure, and upon
which the farmers paid interest. I believe
57075-4-261

there was, if memory serves me right, a
provision for guarantee to the banks against
an overall loss beyond a certain small
percentage.
I have never been able to persuade myself
that the plight of the Prairie farmers has
been nearly so serious as many people have
maintained, and particularly a certain school
of thought on the western prairies which
would have you believe the farmers in that
part of Canada are on the very edge of complete failure.
One good test of how farmers get along
financially is how they pay their taxes at
the end of each year. The honourable gentleman who introduced the bill (Hon. Mr. Pearson) nods his head to this statement. From
long observation, particularly in western
Canada, my conclusion has been that if a
farmer is pinched for cash his taxes are
usually one of the last things he pays, for he
knows that he can carry on for a few years
without being in serious trouble. Hope always
springs eternal that the tide will turn and if
he cannot pay his taxes one year he hopes
he will be able to pay them next year. The
test as to how taxes are paid in rural municipalities is a pretty fair one.
Last February I inquired at the Department of Municipal Affairs in the provincial
Government at Winnipeg for information as
to what percentage of the 1957 tax levy in
rural Manitoba municipalities was paid at
the end of December. It is at the end of
December that penalties usually commence
to apply. I am bound to say that I was somewhat surprised when I was given almost immediately information to the effect that the
portion paid at the end of December, 1957,
was 99.81 per cent of that year's levy, which
is almost a complete slate.
Weil, that excited my curiosity, and I wrote
to the Municipal Affairs Departments of the
provinces of Saskatchewan and Alberta.
Shortly afterwards I received a reply from
the province of Alberta that their rural taxes
at the end of December on the same basis
-that is, the levy for 1957-were over 99
per cent paid. The reply I received from the
province of Saskatchewan was that they did
not care to give out information until they
had the auditors' returns from the municipalities. But I will venture the assertion that
if and when this information is available it
will probably be very close to the experience
of Manitoba and Alberta.
Now, I am old-fashioned enough to think
that it is a bad principle to encourage people
to expect they can get something for nothing,
and I still hold that it was a mistake, an
unfortunate mistake, that this system of free
cash advances on farm grain in western
Canada was brought into effect. It was not

SENATE
necessary, except perhaps to create a favourable attitude of mind on a certain event that
took place that year; but on general principles it is unsound, because it is not only
unfair to the taxpayers but very often it has
an unfortunate effect upon the recipients.
I quite understand that the honourable
senator who is sponsoring this bill (Hon. Mr.
Pearson) is not in a position to give the house
information as to what the cost of these interest-free advances will be. Actually, they
are interest-free advances to the farmers, but
they are not interest-free advances so far
as the taxpayers of this country are concerned. The Treasury has to find the money,
and interest bas to be paid to some people,
either to those who subscribe for Government
bonds or to the banks from which the Government may borrow the money to make the
advances. I would assume as a fair guess that
the cost to the Treasury might run into several hundreds of thousands of dollars. Some
day we shall get the information, but I am
quite aware of the fact that we cannot get
it now. It will have to be borne in mind,

however,

that whether it is $200,000 or

$300,000, it is the taxpayers of the country
who pay it. I grew up on a western farm,
and all my interest is in western farming,
but I do feel it is not a sound practice to
encourage this sort of thing.
Honourable senators, if we are to have this
legislation, I think the amendments proposed
here are in order. It is rather gratifying to
know that of the $35 million total advanced,
$32 million has been repaid, leaving roughly
$3 million still outstanding.
I rather detect in the measure the effort
to make this practice even more popular with
the farmers. I do not like section 5 of the
bill, which amends section 8, whereby a
farmer who has received an advance and has
not been able to liquidate it can carry it
forward to another year and presumably get
a new advance on top of it. I suggest to
the house that is not a very wise provision.
I sometimes think-perhaps it is because
I am out of date-that Parliament is becoming
very indifferent-I was almost going to say
"loose"-in its methods of handling public
money. There is one fact that we should not
forget-at least, one that I cannot forgetnamely, that the interests of the taxpayers
of this country are of paramount importance;
and when we fling money around easily, when
we advance money for this and that and
promise it for the next thing, in the end
the taxpayers have to pay it. We are not
true to our responsibility to the taxpayers
unless vre exercise the greatest possible care
in the spending of the money they give us.
That principle is cardinal, and it may well
be that upon the ability of Parliament to do

this successfully will depend in large measure
the degree of political unrest we may have
in this country in future years. We do not
solve political unrest by handouts-it is impossible to do it. Our debt is increasing.
Demands upon the federal Government to
spend money are made everywhere. Only
this morning the mayors and municipalities
were represented at our Committee on
Finance and were asking for federal aid
to service their municipalities. The universities-and I am not criticizing them-are asking for dormitory accommodation to be
provided for university students. Requests
are increasing in number. It seems to me
that we are always spending more and more
money. I just wish to suggest to the house
once more that the matter of exercising the
greatest possible care in the dispensing of
public money should at all times receive the
most earnest consideration of this bouse.
Motion agreed to and bill read second
time.
REFERRED TO COMMITTEE
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, when shall this bill be read the third
time?
Hon. Mr. Thorvaldson: Honourable senators,
unless any honourable senator wishes this bill
to be referred to a committee, I would suggest that the bill be given third reading
at the next sitting.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: Honourable senators, I
do not wish to delay the bill, but I think it
should be referred to the Banking and Commerce Committee. There is no great rush to
get it through, and it may be that some
honourable senators would like to get certain information beyond that which the sponsor of the bill has been able to give.

BRITISH COLUMBIA COAST STEAMSHIP
SERVICE BILL
FIRST READING

The Hon. the Speaker informed the Senate
that a message had been received from the
House of Commons with Bill C-42, to provide for the resumption of the British Columbia Coast Steamship Service operated by the
Canadian Pacific Railway Company.
Bill read first time.
SECOND READING

The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, when shall this bill be read the second
time?
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Honourable senators, I
move, seconded by the Honourable Senator
Quinn, that this bill be read the second time
now.
Honourable senators, this is a very important measure and I will try to deal with it
as fully and as expeditiously as possible.
Honourable senators are no doubt aware
that this bill provides for the resumption of
coastal steamship service by the Canadian
Pacific Railway Company in the province of
British Columbia. The service, which has
been operating for many years, consisted of
eight ships which carried passengers. There
were also a car ferry and other services from
Vancouver to Victoria, and up the coast in
a northwesterly direction from the city of
Vancouver. As honourable senators know,
this service has been tied up completely
since May 16, 1958, when the employees
went on strike. Negotiations have been
unsuccessfully carried on between the company and three unions ever since the fall of
1957 for a revision of collective argreements
which expired at that time.
These unions are as follows: Seafarers International Union of North America, National
Association of Marine Engineers of Canada,
Inc., and Canadian Merchant Service Guild,
Inc. These unions represented respectively
the unlicensed personnel employed in the
services, the engineer officers employed in
the services, and the masters and deck officers
employed in the services. The services and
facilities of the Department of Labour and

the Minister of Labour have been at the disposal of the parties since the beginning of the
dispute.
When all prescribed conciliation proceedings under the Industrial Relations and Disputes Investigation Act were exhausted, Mr.
Erie Taylor was appointed an industrial inquiry commissioner to look into the matter of
the dispute between the unions and the company and try to arrive at a solution satisfactory to all concerned. Mr. Taylor is an experienced and able mediator, and he spent
some six or seven weeks, unsuccessfully, trying to bring the parties together, and finally
recommended to the Government that the
parties submit their disputes to arbitration.
The company and two of the unions agreed
to submit their difficulties to arbitration, but
the Seafarers International Union absolutely
refused to do so. Following that, meetings
were held in Ottawa between the Minister
and the officers of the Seafarers International
Union and the company officials, but in spite
of the fact that every effort was made no
agreement was reached.
However, in the meantime, shortly after
the strike the company concluded a collective
agreement with the Brotherhood of Railway
and Steamship Clerks, representing stewards
and pursers, which comprises more than one
half of the employees in this service that I
have been speaking about.
This strike, honourable senators, dislocated
this steamship service entirely; it greatly inconvenienced the people of British Columbia,
particularly the people on the island and the
people who lived up the coast; it had an
adverse effect on the economy of the province; it resulted in a loss of many millions of
dollars to the tourist industry, particularly
on Vancouver Island, where all reservations
had to be cancelled; and, moreover, the great
centennial celebration in British Columbia
was materially interfered with.
Black Ball Ferries, operated under provincial jurisdiction, carried on some of the services between the mainland and the island but
were only able to partially fulfil the need.
This service was also interrupted by a strike
and an injunction had to be taken out in the
courts of British Columbia, with the result
that the services were partially restored, but
that matter is still proceeding before the
courts of the province of British Columbia.
Every effort made to resolve the disputes
by negotiations and have the services restored
has failed, thus necessitating the introduction
of the legislation now before us.
This bill which I am endeavouring to explain to honourable senators provides:
(a) for the appointment of an administrator
by the Governor in Council to carry on the
British Columbia Coast Steamship Service of

JULY
the Canadian Pacifie Railway Company, subject to any instructions he may receive from
the Governor in Council. For the purpose
of carrying on the service the administrator
is the agent of the company.
(b) The administrator is directed to resume
the operation of the service which has been
tied up by reason of the strike.
(c) Employees who are on strike are required to resume the duties of their
employment.
(d) The company and the three unions
representing the employees who are on strike
are required to resume negotiations and make
every reasonable effort to conclude a settlement of the issues in dispute between them
and to conclude collective agreements to give
effect to these settlements.
(e) The Governor in Council is given
authority to make regulations for the continued operation of the service under the
direction of the administrator and to establish
procedures for effecting a settlement of the
disputes, including a provision for the appointment of a board of arbitration, should the
parties so request or the Governor in Council
reach the conclusion that it is expedient to
do this.
In addition to what I have already said,
I propose now to go quickly through Bill
C-42, copies of which honourable senators
no doubt have on their desks. I would first
call attention to section 2, the definitions
section, which makes clear that the provisions
of the bill apply to al three unions and to
the collective agreements to which they are
parties with the company, and to the employees covered by these agreements.
Section 3 provides for the appointment of
an administrator to carry on all or any part
of the business of the British Columbia
Coast Steamship Service of the Canadian
Pacifie Railway.
Subsection 2 of that section specifies that
the administrator is the agent of the company
for the purpose of carrying on the business
which he is appointed to administer, but
lt makes clear that he has authority to administer the business thus entrusted to him subject to the instructions of the Governor in
Council, but without any interference on the
part of the company. This, I think, is an
important provision.
Subsection 1 of section 4 provides for
resumption of the shipping operations by the
administrator, and requires every employee
on strike to resume the duties of his employment on the terms and conditions of employment in the collective agreement which applies to him and which covers his employment
with the company. For example, in the
case of engineer-officers it would be the

agreement between the company and the
National Association of Marine Engineers of
Canada, Inc., which is described in Schedule
B to the bill. That agreement sets out the
terms and conditions of employment of the
employees at the time they went on strike.
These terms and conditions of employment,
however, are subject to the amendment specified in subsection 2 of this section. Subsection 2 provides a provisional amendment
of the collective agreements which apply
to the employment of employees returning to
work, by increasing the wage rates specified
therein by 8 per cent, effective from the
date this legislation comes into force. This
is, of course, a provisional increase only;
the rates eventually established will be those
negotiated by the parties or arrived at by
any other method of settlement which may be
adopted.
Section 5: the effect of this section is
that the company, the employees and the
union representing them, will continue to be
bound by the collective agreements as
amended by section 4(2) until new agreements are concluded between them.
Section 6 requires the company and the
unions to renew negotiations and bargain
in good faith with a view to reaching a
settlement of the issues in dispute and
concluding a new collective agreement.
Section 7 confers authority on the Governor
in Council to make regulations for the carrying out of the purposes and provisions of the
act. Paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section
are, in my opinion, self-explanatory. Paragraphs (c) and (d) give authority to the
Governor in Council to prescribe appropriate
procedures for effecting a settlement between
the company and the unions in the event the
parties are unable to resolve the matters at
issue between them by further negotiations,
or as the Governor in Council considers expedient. The authority so conferred includes
authority to refer the matters at issue, or any
part of them, to arbitration by a board of
arbitrators appointed by the Governor in
Council.
Section 8 is, in my opinion, selfexplanatory.
Section 9 affords protection to employees
going back to work against discharge by
reason of having gone on strike.
Section 10 requires the officers of the
unions which represent the employees to rescind any strike notices or strike authorizations previously given. This is to facilitate
the return to work of the striking employees.
That, honourable senators, is briefly an
explanation of the reasons for the measure
and what it contains. I request the sympathetie consideration of honourable members of this chamber to this bill, so that it

can be assented to and brought into operation
as soon as possible. The situation in the
province of British Columbia is most serious
indeed, and this would appear to be the only
method by which the services which have
been rendered by the Canadian Pacifie Railway Company can be restored for the benefit
of the people of that province.
Hon. W. Ross Macdonald: Honourable senators, as the Leader of the Government in
this bouse (Hon. Mr. Aseltine) bas said, this
is indeed very important legislation; in fact,
it is very extraordinary legislation. During
his remarks in respect to section 1 he said
it was clear that such and such would result
from the passage of the bill. With all due
respect to him, I think the bill is most
confusing in many sections.
In the first instance, the bill purports to
force the men to go back to work, but one
bas to read to the very end of the bill to
realize that it is completely compulsory
legislation and that the men have to abide
by the decision of the three arbitrators. As
I say, at first reading one gets the impression
that the men will go back to work, and will
then be given time to negotiate their agreements. It is not until the very end of tbe
bill that the vital words come in, which
require the men to accept the decision of
the board of arbitrators.
Honourable senators will note by section
7, paragraph (d), that the first part provides
for the appointment of three arbitrators by
the Governor in Council and so forth to
consider such matters relating to the revision
or amendment of an existing collective agreement as the parties thereto may request.
But here are the important words. They do
not have to consider only such matters as
the parties may request, but also "...as the
Governor in Council may deem expedient."
And as provided in line 13, the Governor in
Council has powers for giving effect to any
decision which has been arrived at. There
is no doubt that this is compulsory legislatien, and naturally we will look into it very
carefully. I recall it was not so long ago
that members of the present Government,
when in Opposition, went so far as to say
that under no circumstances would they agree
to compulsory legislation affecting the
unemployed. But almost as soon as they are
in power they forget their earlier views and
bring in this most drastic legislation. In one
instance this bill would appear to confiscate
the property of the Canadian Pacifie Railway
Company. The representative appointed by
the Government is, on one hand, the agent
of the company; and, on the other hand, he
appears to be acting for the Crown. So it
is very confusing legislation and I think
we should consider it most carefully.

It is interesting to note that this bill was
carried unanimously in the other house
yesterday. There was not one dissenting
voice. We have not much chance of changing the bill when the members of the other
bouse were unanimous in their view, but
I will say at the outset that if I thought it
were possible to persuade them to change
certain provisions of the bill I would do so.
I think that would be a pretty hopeless task,
however.
As the honourable Leader of the Government has said, the purpose of the bill is
to provide for resumption of steamship
service between Vancouver and Vancouver
Island and to many points along the British
Columbia coast. This service is to be resumed under an administrator, who will take
over the Canadian Pacifie Railway Company's British Columbia Coast Steamship
Service and operate its remaining ships.
As we have heard, the strike commenced
on May 16, and the honourable Leader of
the Government bas said in effect that since
then there has been only a trickle of traffic
and supplies between the British Columbia
mainland and Vancouver Island. Before the
employees went on strike a conciliation
board was appointed, the chairman of which
recommended a 25 per cent general increase
in pay. The employer's representative recommend a 17 per cent increase and the employees' nominee asked for a 40 to 50 per
cent increase, to be spread over a period
of two years. Well, the company and the
employees could not agree on any percentage, so the strike took place.
The honourable leader bas told us that
the tourist business in British Columbia bas
suffered because of the strike. One report
that I read disclosed that up to the present
time the tourist business bas declined to the
extent of $200 million, that more than 300,000
tourist reservations had been cancelled, and
that approximately 200,000 people living on
Vancouver Island and in the districts served
by these steamships have been practically eut
off from the mainland for all general services.
There has been an air service, of course. So,
as the honourable leader has said, we are
now faced with a very serious problem.
I am informed that about 930 employees
will be affected by this legislation. Frankly,
I do not know how the figure of 930 is
arrived at. That might have been the number
of employees when the strike commenced,
but, as I will point out later, nobody knows
how many will now be affected. In any
event, of the 930 employees, my information
is that approximately 540 of them, 58 per
cent, have since signed work agreements
with the company and are anxious to resume

JULY 25, 1958
their duties. In other words, nearly 60 per
cent of the employees who went on strike
want to get back to work on the terms
offered by the company, namely, an 8 per
cent increase. The remaining employees, who
represent about 42 per cent of the workers,
have not entered into agreements and the
result is they are preventing 58 per cent of
the employees from resuming work. It is
not a general strike of all employees of the
company. The majority want to get back
to work but the minority say no, and of
course none of them can go back. That is
a very important feature of the existing
conditions, and perhaps it makes this legislation more necessary than it otherwise
would be. In other words, if all the employees
had wanted to stay off the job this legislation might have had a different aspect.
If the bill is passed all the employees,
the 42 per cent group as well as the 58 per
cent group, will be required to return to
work at a wage increase of 8 per cent. The
administrator will remain in charge until
all the agreements have been signed, and I
take it this service will then be returned
to the Canadian Pacific Railway Company.
As the honourable leader has pointed out,
the bill provides that the parties to the dispute can refer any questions not agreed on
to an independent board for its decision.
And a very important clause, consisting of
only a few dozen words, provides that as a
last resort the Governor in Council may refer
any matter not settled to a board of
arbitrators.
When this bill first came to my attention
I was somewhat doubtful of the jurisdiction
of Parliament to pass it. At first I was under
the impression that according to sections 91
and 92 of the British North America Act
matters of this type would come within the
powers which are assigned exclusively to the
provincial Governments. However, after considering the matter a little more carefully I
am inclined to think that Parliament does
have jurisdiction in the matter. I am not
going into the question at great length, because it does not trouble me at the moment,
but it might trouble some other honourable
senator.
I am sure we all are aware that when
British Columbia came into Confederation
that province was given an undertaking by
the Canadian Government that there would
be rail and water service between British
Columbia and the other parts of Canada. No
doubt that undertaking included service
from the east to not only the mainland
of British Columbia but to the island of
Vancouver. That service has been put into
effect. Now we have rail and water services

extending from the eastern border of Canada,
including Newfoundland and Prince Edward
Island, to the western coast and the island
of Vancouver.
There was a reference to the Supreme
Court of Canada on the validity and applicability of the Industrial Relations and Disputes Investigation Act, and the question of
the jurisdiction of the dominion Parliament
in matters of this kind was dealt with in
(1955) Supreme Court Reports, 544. I am
not going to delay the house by reading the
report of that hearing, but I think I can
safely say that the majority of the court
found that Parliament had exclusive legislative jurisdiction in the matter of ships
in Canada. It seems to me, therefore, that
Parliament has the necessary jurisdiction to
pass the bill now before us.
I am somewhat concerned about the great
delay that has taken place since this problen
came to the attention of the Governrment.
In introducing the bill the honourable leader
stated that the strike commenced on May 16.
A board of conciliation sat some considerable time before that. The Government
knew, therefore, that there was a serious
situation in British Columbia. What did the

long to realize that it was completely hopeless

Honourable senators will recall that on
June 11 the honourable senator from
Kamloops (Hon. Mr. Smith), speaking on this
matter in the Senate, brought forcibly to the
attention of the Governrment the condition
existing on the west coast. The Government
entirely ignored what he said. The honourable senator referred to conditions existing
on Vancouver Island, and to the conciliation
which was taking place and the efforts of
Mr. Taylor to get the matter settled. I quote
the honourable senator's remarks as reported
in the first column on page 159 of the Senate
Hansard of June 11:
Everything was going just fine and dandy in connection with the big Centennial holiday year until
350 employees of the C.P.R. Steamships-members
of the Seafarers International Union-went out on
strike on Friday night, May 16. As a result of this
strike the 10 C.P.R. boats are lying idle in harbour
at Vancouver, Victoria and Nanaimo. On May 27
the federal Government announced the appointment of Eric G. Taylor, of Toronto, as a mediator
who was to make an effort to get the strike
settled. However, Mr. Taylor returned to eastern
Canada last week without having accomplished anything. Neediess to say, the people of British
Columbia, who were hopeful and patient, are
feeling very discouraged over the outcome, and
particularly so because of indications that this
strike may drift Into a long-drawn-out battle. This
strike Is approaching the end of the fourth weekthe day after tomorrow, to be exact.

view of the failure of Mr. Taylor to effect a
settlement, they were bringing all the parties

in my initial remarks.

During this four-week period the loss suffered by
the tourist service industry on Vancouver Island
is reliably estimated to exceed $2 million. More
than a week ago it was reported that over
30,000 reservations had been cancelled. Honourable
senators, I cannot possibly convey to you what
an injury our economy will suffer if this strike is
prolonged indefinitely.
It will be felt worst on Vancouver Island: it will
be just terrible for the province of British Columbia.
But the loss does not end there. It is a national
calamity. Direct losses will affect every level of
tax collections; unemployment will be increased;
building and capital expansion in the tourist industry
will be cancelled.
One province cannot suffer
a setback like this without it affecting Canada
as a whole.

The first attempt to end the 18-day C.P.R. ship
strike has failed. Special mediator Eric G. Taylor
said Monday after a three-hour parley with both
sides. "Nothing transpired to indicate that the
strike will not continue indefinitely." A spokesman
for the C.P.R. also confirmed the session had been
fruitless. And he added that no arrangements were
made for further meetings of all the parties concerned. The company repeated that the coast fleet
was operating at a loss, and said that any increased
grant would have to come out of increased charges

wanted ta go over to Victoria ta see the
lovely young lady were forced ta stay in

I say the Governrnent has ignored the
needs of the province of British Columbia
during the last 45 days. Had it taken the
advice of the honourable senator from Kamloops this whole thing would have been
settled six weeks aga. And I say the Governmnent cannot be excused for flot tackling
this problem long before this.
Now, honourable senators I arn going ta
refer just briefiy ta the bull. As the Government must have realized for the last twa
months that eventually it was going ta have
ta bring in legislation for the settlement of
this dispute, I would have expected it ta
present ta us a bull that was quite clear,
instead of one with confusing language, such
as this one contains.
For instance, clause 3 provides for the
appointment of an administrator ta carry on
ail or any part of the business of the company. In subclause 2 of that clause the administratar is described as the agent of the company. He is nat the agent of the Gavernment.
I would flot suppose he could be the agent
of bath parties. Yet the company has no
right ta contrai its awn business through its
own agent although, according ta the same
subsection, the administrator rnay do such
things as he sees fit for the carrying on of
the business of the company.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: And the company wIll
bear the expense.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: That I do not know.
He carrnes on the business of the company
but is subi ect ta any instructions of the
Governor in Council. Does my honourable
friend the Leader of the Government suggest
that those words are there in order that
the expenses and lasses, if any, will be charged
to the company, and if there is any profit
the Government wiil get the advantage of
-it? Is that what I understand rny honourable friend ta say?
Hou. Mr. Assumie: No, no.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I arn sure that is not
-the meaning of the clause, but I may interpret
the clause as 1 see fit and the honourable
Leader of the Governiment may interpret it
as he sees fit. I say that in labour legislation,
especially, the meaning of the words should
'be abundantly clear.

.Clause 4 of the bill provides that every
ernplayee who is now on strike shaîl return
to work. I arn informed-and the Leader
of the Governrnent can correct me if I arn
wrong-that twa ships which were operating
at the time of the strike have since been sold
by the campany. What I would like ta know
is, will the men who formerly were employed
an those ships have ta return ta work?
Here is what clause 4 says:
Forthwith upon bis appointment the administrator
shall resurne the carrying on of the business of the
company that was suspended by reason of the
strike now existing, and every employee who Is
now on strike shail return to the duties of bis
employment in the business of the company on
the terms and conditions set forth In the existing
collective agreement binding on him as amended by
this act.

Weil, now, twa ships have been rernoved
from that service. But the language of this
section could be interpreted ta mnean that
ahl men who are on strike have ta return
ta work, although there is no ship for some
of them ta go ta. My honourable friend may
say that is not what the section means at ail,
and anather member of the house may say
sarnething else. But again I point out that
the bll is s0 canfusing that it would strain
the wits af a Philadelphia lawyer, ta say
nathing of how it would confuse the men
who are on strike.
Why should we pass labour legisiation that
is not; dean and which may result in the
expense and trouble of going to the courts
ta have it interpreted? During aIl the tirne
that a strike was anticipated, and throughout
the strike, the Government has had plenty af
tirne ta bring forward a clear bill which
would not require interpretation by the
courts.
I arn not at ail sure how many men are on
strike at the present tixne.
Mon. Mr. Thorvaldson: Three hundred and
three.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: My honourable friend
says 303. 1 don't know how he arrives at
that figure.
Hon. Mr. Thorvaldson: That figure was
given yesterday by the Leader of the Opposition in the House ai Communs.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I don't know how
the Leader af the Opposition over there
arrived at the figure.
If I understand one of the many interpretations given ta this bill-and I don't say this
is the right one-it is that the men who went
an strike from those two ships which have
been taken out af the service, are no longer
on strike. I arn also told-I do not; have the
autharity for this-by a specialist in this
branch of the law that those men who went

SENATE
on strike and who have since obtained other
employment are no longer on strike. I was
told that originally 930 men went on strike,
but I do not know how many of that number
worked on ships which have been withdrawn from service and how many have
accepted other employment. As I said at the
outset of my remarks, 58 per cent of the men
who went on strike want to go back to work,
but nobody knows how many men are now
on strike, because no evidence has been
brought before this bouse. I am not going to
refer to what was said in the other house in
this respect, but I haven't seen in the press
even an estimate of how many of the 930
men cannot get other employment or whose
ships have been withdrawn, and how many
have other employment and do not wish to
go back.
Hon. Mr. MacDonald: Would the honourable Leader of the Opposition please tell us
why we should worry about how many men
are prepared to go back, if we can get the
ships back into operation?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: My honourable friend
from Queens (Hon. Mr. MacDonald) may not
be worrying about how many men are prepared to go back. I say again that 58 per cent
of the men who were on strike wanted to go
back and apparently 42 per cent did not want
to go back. It may be that now 100 per cent
may be ready to go back. If that be so, they
would probably go back without any compulsion. Let us say that 90 or 95 per cent
are ready to return to work. In any event, we
don't know what the figure is or whether
this legislation is necessary. If we had that
information we could come to a conclusion
much more quickly.
Hon. Mr. Thorvaldson: Would the honourable senator allow me to make a correction
with respect to the figure of 303 men being
on strike? The statement made yesterday by
the Leader of the Opposition in the House of
Commons was that the Seafarers International
Union-a union which has more than once
in recent years been the centre of controversy
-represented
303 employees of the British
Columbia Coast steamships. It seems obvious,
therefore, that there may be more than that
number on strike.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Thank you. But, I am
still as confused as ever, in spite of what
the Leader of the Opposition in the other
house may have said. He has not clarified the
matter from my point of view; I hope he
has for the honourable senator from Winnipeg
South (Hon. Mr. Thorvaldson). I do thank
him for the information.
Honourable senators, I do not intend to
Ielay the house much longer. I wish only to

refer to an apparent amendment which this
bill contains. When the bill was originally
drafted, but was not distributed-although
some members of the Senate, I think, saw
the draft-it proposed the appointment of one
arbitrator to settle this whole matter. According to section 7(d) of the bill now before us
the proposal is to appoint three arbitrators.
I think it is better, of course, to have a board
of three arbitrators than to have only one.
But I fail to understand why the Government
did not go a little further and provide for
establishment of a conciliation board in the
usual manner under the Industrial Relations
and Disputes Investigation Act, setting up
three arbitrators, one to be appointed by the
men, one by the company and one by the
Government. It may be suggested that the
men could not agree on an appointment. Certainly, they could have been given five days
within which to name their representative.
With such a board, I think there would have
been a much greater chance of the parties
coming to a settlement without the force of
law or compulsion.
I am almost persuaded to move an amendment now with respect to the appointment
of such a board of conciliation. But in view
of the overwhelming majority of Government
support in the other place, I am sure such
an amendment would be hopeless and would
only result in unnecessary delay.
For the sake of argument, suppose honourable senators all agreed that this bill should
be amended to provide for three arbitrators,
one to be appointed by the men and one by
the company, and those two arbitrators to
appoint a third or, failing to do so within
five days, the Government would step in
and appoint the third. What would happen if
we passed such an amendment? The amended
bill would have to go back to the House of
Commons, and under its rules the amendment
could not be considered until tomorrow.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Was that procedure
not tried once before, and did it not result
in three different decisions?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I don't know what
was done before; I am thinking of what
would happen at this time. We are now up
against the problem of trying to reach a
settlement of a terrible condition that exists
on the west coast.
I was explaining what would happen if
such an amendment to the bill were made
here. It would go to the other house and
perhaps not be considered before tomorrow.
I am satisfied the other bouse would not
agree to it. A committee from that bouse
would then be appointed to meet a committee from this house. I doubt that they
would agree to our proposals, or we to

JULY 25, 1958
theirs. There would be a stalemate; we
could think about it over the weekend, and
perhaps consider it further on Monday or
Tuesday next. That would cause a serious
delay. But I am not going to propose an
amendment, for, as I have said, I do not
think there is the slightest chance of having
it accepted. I notice the Government did
amend the original bill by inserting a clause
11, which provides:
This act shall expire no later than the thirtieth
sitting day of the next session of Parliament.
If the bill as originally introduced had
been passed the legislation might have
remained in force for ever. Thank goodness this measure will not remain in force
long and will be automatically repealed. The
sooner it is repealed, the better for all concerned.
Hon. Charles G. Hawkins: I would like to
ask the Leader of the Government (Hon. Mr.
Aseltine) who will be responsible for the
financial administration of the company's
property during the time the administrator
is in charge?
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: In my opinion it will
be the company, because the administrator
is the agent of the company.
Hon. Mr. Hawkins: Is there any provision
for reimbursing the company in the event
of a loss?
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: No, I do not think so.
Hon. Norman P. Lambert: Is there any
assurance that this bill, if it becomes law,
will have the desired effect of renewing the
operation of the C.P.R. steamships in British
Columbia?
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: I feel sure that if the
bill is passed today the ships will be in operation tomorrow. It is my understanding that as
soon as this bill receives royal assent the
administrator will be appointed and will immediately take charge.
Hon. Mr. Lamberi: There are two parties
involved, the employer and the employee. Is
there any assurance that the labour organizations, which have asked for a 25 per cent
increase in pay and will be given an 8 per
cent increase by this legislation, will accede
to the suggestions embodied in the legislation
and return to do a job they have refused to
do for the last seven weeks?
Hon. Mr. Aseline: If what I heard over the
radio the night this bill was introduced is
correct, it is pretty well conceded that the
men will go back to work and the ships will
be put into operation immediately, with a
view to the parties continuing their negotiations and reaching and ratifying collective
agreements before the expiration of the act.

Hon. Mr. Lambert: Honourable senators, it
is to be hoped that the prospect outlined by
the honourable Leader of the Government
(Hon. Mr. Aseltine) proves to be correct, but
for the life of me I cannot see any great
assurance of it in this legislation which, to
say the least, is makeshift legislation. It has
an element of compulsion about it, and it
also rides the other horse of encouraging
further voluntary or collective bargaining.
Honourable senators have seen the results in
this case of an attempt at collective bargaining for the last two months. They have not
been very satisfactory. If this legislation is
put into force and expires, say, by January
and nothing further has developed, are we to
assume that the compulsory provisions of the
bill will still apply, and that the idea of collective bargaining will be displaced by a compulsory arbitration feature presided over by
an administrator?
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: I am not assuming anything, but we have got to do something and
give these people a chance to get together.
We have to give the people of British Columbia this steamship service, and if the honourable senator has any other solution to suggest
I would like to know what it is.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: I have one obvious suggestion to make and it is based upon the
traditional and historic functions of this Upper
Chamber. As soon as possible after the honourable senator from Kamloops (Hon. Mr.
Smith), when addressing this house in the
Throne Speech debate on June 11, warned us
of the seriousness of this problem on the
coast, a special committee should have been
appointed by the Senate to deal with the
matter. Surely it is one of the responsibilities
and undoubtedly it is one of the functions of
Parliament to lead and instruct public opinion.
One way to do this is through discussions
such as we have had in committees appointed
by the Senate to deal with subjects which
have a definite application to the interests and
welfare of our people.
As between legislative responsibilities and
administrative responsibilities, the time of
members of Parliament is about evenly divided, but in the last fifteen years or so the
tendency has been to neglect administrative
responsibilities in relation to convincing public opinion and employing the advantages and
usefulness of consolidated public opinion with
regard to conditions that exist at any given
time.
By its constitutional provisions and tradition, the Senate has a big responsibility to
attend to such functional matters as that
represented in this bill, which affects the
life and interests of a provincial area. If
this had been done it would not have been

SENATE
the first time that the Senate had been able
to influence, through one of its committees,
a very important trend of action in a part of
this country. I submit with all the forcefulness I can express that our responsibility
in connection with this situation in British
Columbia has not been met. It is not good
enough to suggest that we should wait for the
inspiration to come from the other house or
from the Government of the country. I think
this body and this chamber is perfectly competent, with its status, its experience and
its appreciation of the country's conditions,
to take action to enlighten public opinion in
Canada as a whole upon the facts that underlie this strike which bas been holding up
the interests and the welfare of the people
of British Columbia. I am quite well aware
that we have these responsibilities, and they
have been exercised in the past to good effect.
I am not going to take up the time of the
Senate by going into detail, but if anyone
wants to refresh his memory or inform his
mind of occasions on which the Senate has
performed usefully in connection with matters
arising in British Columbia, and in several
other parts of Canada, I would recommend
the perusal of what is virtually a textbook
on the Senate, written by MacKay, a very
good Maritime student, entitled, The Unreformed Senate of Canada. It is a mine of
information which I think might stimulate
the imaginations of our present members to
realize that there are great possibilities of
service to this country that we are not rendering at all.
My first experience in this connection was
shortly after I became a member of the
Senate, when the problem of transportation
was being considered and a study was
initiated here through its Standing Committee on Transport and Communications in
relation to a new transport act, which was
aiming at a consolidation of transport interests in Canada and the establishment of what
were called agreed charges. Some of our
friends here will remember that that committee's work led the way to a very useful
anticipation of transport needs in this country. This matter might have been dealt with
in other ways and elsewhere, as for instance
in the other house, but it was first introduced
and discussed and thrashed out in this Committee on Transportation and Communications, and what the committee did was approved in this Upper Chamber. It was in
anticipation of legislation that that committee was authorized by the Senate to conduct the inquiry.
Honourable senators, I submit that before
this bill now before us was brought down at
this late stage, after many weeks of intimation
and of warning, action should have been taken

that might have helped to solve this difficulty
in a peaceful way without this unprecedented
form of compulsory legislation being impressed upon the people of this country. I think
a great deal could have been done if our
Standing Committee on Transportation and
Communications, say, had had the whole
problem of this disturbance at Vancouver
before it. It could have been fully aired
before the committee, with evidence given
by representatives of labour unions, representatives of the railways, and representatives
of the Governments of the province of Britis
Columbia and the municipality of Vancouver.
By so doing the floodlight of public opinion,
which used to be regarded as of some importance in this country, might have been
brought to bear upon this whole situation.
It seems to me that we have something to
learn from the example of similar activities in
the committees of the Senate in Washington,
from which we have had ample evidence in
the past year or two of the beneficial results
that have been conferred in the United States
by the hearing of cases involving irregularities in the conduct of labour unions, for one
instance.
The whole position of labour in relation to
the railway and the operation of these ships
is a most important thing to have settledbecause the question remains unsettled.
This bill leaves the whole question of the
economy involved in operating these ships
entirely unsettled. I have been told on fairly
good authority that those coastal boats have
not operated profitably for some time. Well,
I think we should have authoritative evidence
either to disprove that statement or substantiate it. The same thing applies from the
point of view of labour. If there is a
fundamentally weak economic aspect to this
position at the coast in relation to the operation of coastal steamers, then I think the
public of Canada is entitled to know it. We
had a good example of it on the other coast,
as was brought out in the other house, when
the Canadian National Railways moved their
ships to another country, and they are now
being considered for sale under different registration. We did not have the example of the
Government enforcing any legislation to cover
that situation. If it is unprofitable for the
C.N.R. to operate boats on the Atlantic coast,
and boats to the West Indies, from that coast,
then we have a very good right to know
whether or not a similar situation exists in
relation to the C.P.R. boats on the Pacific
coast.
Honourable senators, I submit that between
now and the expiration of this legislation this
chamber could do no better than to employ
its Standing Comrnmittee on Transportation
and Communications to have full inquiry

JULY 25,1958
made into this problem with a view not only
of enlightening public opinion, but of helping
us to obtain a clearer idea of what we are
about than we have now.
Hon. T. A. Crerar: Honourable senators, by
any measure we apply to it this bill is a
very important one. It is a matter of regret
that the bill did not come to this house
earlier. There is very much merit in the
criticisn just made by the honourable senior
senator from Ottawa (Hon. Mr. Lambert).
This thing is not new. The strike which this
measure hopes to overcome has been going on
since May 16. It was quite evident six weeks
ago that the ordinary methods of settling
these disputes, or of trying to arrive at a
settlement, had been exhausted and were
useless. If the Government had then taken
the steps that it has taken now there would
have been an opportunity for this house
to call in the various parties to the dispute,
secure all the facts, give a measure of information to public opinion, and bring the
great force of public opinion to bear.
That has not been done and now we have
to deal with the matter at this late date. Having in mind the circumstances upon the Pacific
Coast this legislation, or legislation of this
kind, in my judgment, is fully justified, although I am bound to offer a word of
criticism as to the form in which the remedy
is presented to us.
There is something in the criticism offered
by the Leader of the Opposition (Hon. Mr.
Macdonald) that this bill in some respects,
indeed in several respects, lacks clarity. I
suspect that the Governrment has been hoping
against hope that some avenue of settlement
would open up and that it would be relieved
of the increasing pressure to bring in remedial
legislation. Well, the matter was not settled
and so we have this bill. It seems to me it
would have been better if something of the
precedent established in the settlement of
the railway strike of 1950 had been followed
here.
Implicit in this legislation is the compulsory
feature. Let no one be deceived about that.
The objection by the party of our honourable
friends opposite in the House of Commons
In 1950 was to the compulsory feature of
the legislation then introduced to end the
railway strike. Now it is quite clear to
everyone that if there is one characteristic
of all our political parties today it is their
desire not to give offence to labour, and so
the matter of compulsory arbitration in almost
every case has been ruled out. We have al
tried to create the impression that we thought
it was something evil that should be swept
under the rug and kept there.
But on two occasions, in 1950 and again
today, we have to fall back on that principle.

Now, my contention is, honourable senators,
that the public interest, the broad public
interest, is paramount over everything else,
and I hope presently to give a few examples
in support of this view. But our political
parties have shied away from the idea of
using compulsion in much the same way that
the illiterate peasant frorn the hills of Wicklow in Ireland would shy away from a
ghost.
I think the time has come when we have
to take a new look at this matter. It is interesting to note that this principle of the
supremacy of the public interest has been
invoked in several instances in the past. The
first important instance was when the Board
of Railway Commissioners was set up about
60 years ago. The railways of Canada were
then untrammelled, as far as regulation was
concerned. If they attempted to exact freight
rates that were considered exorbitant the
only appeal was to the Governor in Council;
and in those days, honourable senators, that
was a pretty slender reed to lean upon.
Well, 60 years ago, in recognition of the fact
that the public interest required that the
railways be brought under a measure of control, the Board of Railway Commissioners for
Canada was established and by legislation
endowed with certain rather extensive
powers. Thereafter the railways could not
discriminate in freight rates as they had been
doing before that time. They could not
increase their freight rates without holding
a public hearing where the public could come
and make representations. If a farmer's livestock was killed on a railway track the company had to pay compensation. Formerly a
farmer could sue the railway company, but
the company could take him through the
courts to the Privy Council, if necessary, and
wreck him long before they got there. So
this principle of the supremacy of the public
interest was applied and carried through, and
no one today, not even the railways themselves, would want to go back to the old
state of affairs.
Another instance is that of the grain trade
in western Canada. Sixty years ago or more
in western Canada there was no restraint on
the grain trade. Any person could by clever
advertising induce a farmer to sell his grain
to him, or supposedly sell his grain to him.
He could pocket the proceeds realized fron
the sale of the grain and depart, and al he
could be charged with was theft, the farmer
having to lay the information. Well, the Canada Grain Act was passed and again the
principle of supremacy of the public interest
was invoked. A board was set up, known as
the Board of Grain Commissioners. That
board today controls the traders, it licenses
the traders, it lays down regulations under

SENATE
which the grain trade is to be carried on;
and I say to this honourable house there is
today not a grain trader or farmer or businessman who would want to go back to the old
state of affairs that obtained prior to the
passing of the Grain Act.
So we have made progress in these matters.
The banks also are regulated, and this
principle has been carried out in other directions as well.
Well, I sometimes wonder if we have not
nearly reached the time when the principle
of the public interest should be recognized
as paramount in many of these labour matters.
The unions would for the moment reject it,
although I am bound to say that I believe
there would be a surprisingly large body of
support among union members themselves
in favour of some regulation of this kind.
Hon. Mr. Horner: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: In a matter of this kind
the two parties could bargain as to wages;
they could have their collective agreements
and employ all the mechanisms required to
try to reach a settlement. But, failing to
do so, both sides would be compelled to
arbitrate under fair auspices and accept the
results of the arbitration. That, in effect, was
what happened in 1950.
That does not mean that every industry in
the broad dominion should be subject to
this procedure. There are certain classes of
services to the public that stand out and require special treatment. One of them is
transportation service. If you tie up our
railways you not only endanger loss of property, but loss of life. Another class of service
is that given by hospitals. I believe we are
greatly to be congratulated upon the fact
that while hospital workers, including nurses,
often have onerous hours, they have had little
or no labour trouble. The same principle I
am suggesting applies to firemen and policemen. Our military services, as a matter of
fact, cannot organize a union and demand
better working conditions or wages; they are
debarred from doing so.
As I say, there are classes of services with
respect to which it is not too much to require
that, when the ordinary bargaining processes
fail to reach a settlement between two parties,
then in the public interest-which is the
paramount interest-the Government should
step in to create the machinery to settle
those differences. But I would not give that
machinery general application. After all, if
an automobile or implement factory shuts
down because of a labour dispute, the public
interest is not greatly affected by it. The
people who work at the factory may be
affected directly, but not the general public.
But if, for instance, the firemen in a large

city like Montreal make certain demands
through their unions and an impasse is
reached, and if they go on strike and refuse
to work and buildings burn down, I say
definitely the public interest is then affected.
The same is true in respect of the maintenance of law and order by our police forces.
The time is coming, I venture to say, when
we will take a new look at these conditions.
Furthermore, labour unions in their own interests should carefully consider certain
procedures. They would inspire greater confidence in the public if, for instance, they
agreed to a supervised ballot in any large
labour organization before a strike takes
place. The labour unions can no more refuse
to march in step with progressive public
opinion than could the railways or the grain
trade 60 years ago. I venture these remarks
simply because they arise out of the bill.
Now may I make a few remarks about
the bill itself. There is in it, I think, an
element of unfairness. Although I am no
particular friend of the Canadian Pacific Railway, I would point out that the administrator
is given complete control of the operation of
the Canadian Pacific steamships on the Pacific
coast. If he runs them carelessly and piles
up a loss, the railway company has to meet
it. It will not be met by the Government
or any one else; the railway has to bear that
responsibility and carry the loss if any. I
think my honourable friend the senior senator
from Ottawa (Hon. Mr. Lambert) is correct
when he says that the services have been
running at a loss. In any event if this bill
is passed the railway company will have to
carry any loss that occurs, yet it will have
no opportunity to control the expense. That
state of affairs is about as far down the road
to industrial anarchy as we have gone so far.
That objectionable feature in this bill would
have been overcome if the suggestion I made
earlier had been used as a means to reach
a settlement; that is, we could have said
plainly "You are going to arbitrate, you will
accept the results of the arbitration, and no
one is required to work if he does not wish
to." In that way I am sure the matter would
have been settled quickly.
I have another point. Section 4(1), which
orders the men back to work, states:
Forthwith upon his appointment the administrator
shall resurne the carrying on of the business of
the company that was suspended by reason of the
strike now existing, and every employee who is
now on strike shall return to the duties of his
employment in the business of the company on
the terms and conditions set forth-

By what law is he going to be compelled to
return?
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): By this

JULY 25. 1958
Hon. Mr. Crerar: What are the sanctions if
he does flot return?
Hon. Mr. Aselline: As provided by the
Criminal Code.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: What are the penalties?
Hon. Mr. Aselline: There are no specific
penalties in the bill, but the Criminal Code
provides that penalties for infraction of an
act of Parliament will apply.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: That may be. At the
moment I do flot recall what those penalties
are. But this strike has now been going on
for more than two months. Suppose one of
the employees decided six weeks ago that he
was through with this service and went to
Alberta.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: He is no longer on strike;
hie has left the service of the company.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: That is your opinion.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: I will accept that. But in
any case, I think the bill could have been
somiewhat clearer.
I believe the legisiation is necessary. It is,
however, unfortunate that it was flot introduced six weeks ago. Undoubtedly the peopie on the coast have been put to considerable
inconvenience and a great degree of loss by
reason of mhe strike. It was quite apparent
even six weeks ago that this matter was flot
going to be settled; and if the members of
the Government had any remote hope mhat
it might be settled, they should have taken a
dloser look at the ability to carry on a contest
of this kind which has more than once been
manifested by the leaders of the Seafarers
Union.
Hon. William M. Wall: Honourable senators, may I ask the honourable Leader of
the Government how he intends to proceed
after the bill has been agreed to in principle?
Shail we be afforded an opportunlty to asic
questions about specific problems which he
may flot answer in his closing remarks?
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Mfter the second reading
is given I wfll move the third reading, so
that the bill may be given royal assent
presently.
Motion agreed to and bull read second time.
TIIIRD READING

The Hon. lte Speaker: Honourable senators, when shail the bill be rend the third
time?
Hon. Mr. Aseltino: Honourable senators, I
move that the bill be rend the third time now.
Hon. John A. McDonald: May I asic the
honourable Leader of the Governmnent (Hon.
Mr. Aseltine) if hie can tell us who the administrator will be?

Hon. Mr. Aseltine: I amn sorry, I have flot
that information, and if I did have it would
not be possible for me to divulge it, for the
bull is not yet law and it would be unfair to
any person who might have been considered
for the position to disclose mhe fact. A sinxilar
answer to that question was given in the
other house.
Hon. Mr. McDonald: I arn sure honourable
senators will support this legisiation in the
sincere hope that it will accomplish its purpose; and at the same time we trust that the
administrator, whoever hie may be, will be
endowed with those fine qualities of heart
and mind which will enable him to meet with
the greatest possible success and cause the
least annoyance to the parties in dispute.
I cannot all.ow this occasion to go by without asking the honourable Leader of the
Government to bring to the attention of the
Governmnent, and of the Minister of Transport
in particular, the need for doing something,
even at this late date, to have the Canadian
National Steamships service resumed between
Canada and the West Indies. We are losing
valuable trade with the West Indies because
this service has not been in operation for
many znonths, and I do hope that something
may be accomplished toward restoration of
this service.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: I shail be glad to bring
this matter to mhe attention of the appropriate
minister.
Hou. William M. Wall: Honourable senators, I was hoping that the honourable
Leader of the Government would have felt
there was sufficient interest in the provisions
of this legislation to ask that they be examined in Commnittee of the Whole. As he
has not done this I should like to make one
or two comments in the form of an inquiry,
and perhaps he might care to comment upon
them.
This legisîntion is ad hoc and remedial and
to meet a specific situation. The honourable
Leader said the Governiment has been doing
everything possible to meet the situation.
Perhaps yes, and perhaps no; one could argue
this. It is a fact, however, that in essence
this legisiation will establish a rather significant and important precedent. I cannot
help but suggest that Parliament is in effect
entering the field of supposedly free negotiations between management and labour, and it
is doing so on almost a prescribed wage level.
In other words, it does not say to the parties,
"Go ahead and negotiate." It says, "You will
negotiate, but we are going to set a floor on
the negotiations."l This floor is in effect set
out in section 4(2) of the bill, which prescribes the new wage scale to be in effect

SENATE
by statute for a period of time. How long
that period of time is going to run, nobody
seems to know.
I would suggest that the negotiations are
no longer free but are prejudiced to the
extent of this statute. That is a very important precedent. Directly or indirectly,
Parliament, by statutory legislation, is in
effect entering the field of mandatory prescription of immediate wage levels at which
future negotiations are to be continued.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: I would refer the
honourable senator to the decision of the
Supreme Court of Canada in 1955, which
was mentioned by the honourable Leader of
the Opposition (Hon. Mr. Macdonald), wherein
it was held that the Parliament of Canada
has this power under the Industrial Relations
and Disputes Investigation Act.
Hon. Mr. Wall: I know about the ruling
of the Supreme Court, but would the Government Leader care to comment on whether
Parliament has ever exercised that power?
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: I cannot answer that
question.
Hon. Mr. Wall: That is the comment I am
making, that in effect Parliament is now
entering this field, and although it is not
being asked to write a collective agreement
it is taking a new and unprecedented step
by putting a floor in what I think has been
termed a provisional amendment by the
Minister of Justice. It could be an important precedent with respect to future conciliation methods.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Is the honourable senator suggesting that this is a floor?
Hon. Mr. Wall: I am suggesting that in
effect it will become a floor.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: No. That is not what
the act provides.
Hon. Mr. Wall: It is not conceivable that
negotiations could go below that floor.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: For all practical
purposes.
Hon. Mr. Wall: Yes, for practical purposes.
Motion agreed to and bill read third time.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, this bill, originating in the House of
Commons and entitled "An Act to provide
for the resumption of the British Columbia
Coast Steamship Service operated by the
Canadian Pacific Railway Company", has
been read a third time and is now ready to
pass. Is it your pleasure to pass the bill?
Hon. John J. Connolly (Ottawa West): Honourable senators, I do not wish to delay the
house, but before the bill is passed I should

like to make one or two remarks which I
think bear upon this type of legislation, particularly in view of the fact it may be establishing a precedent, and in some respects an
undesirable precedent. Like other honourable
senators, when I first read the bill I was
concerned that perhaps section 4 encroached
upon some of the matters that are given
exclusively to the jurisdiction of the provinces under section 92 of the British North
America Act. I refer particularly to the matter of property and civil rights, because in
section 4 there is a determination of a wage
rate, which I think is normally something
that falls within provincial jurisdiction. However, as both the honourable Leader of the
Opposition (Hon. Mr. Macdonald) and the
Leader of the Government (Hon. Mr.
Aseltine) have said, there seems to be, first
of all, no doubt whatever that Parliament
has the right to enact legislation of this kind.
Parliament alone has that right, and presumably because of the provisions of section 91,
subsection 10, of the British North America
Act, which deals with navigation and shipping. Indeed, that bas been confirmed by the
reference to the Supreme Court of Canada
in 1955, in which the majority of the Court
held that the Industrial Relations and Disputes Investigation Act was within the competence of Parliament. So if Parliament has
the jurisdiction, and if this is the only legislative body that has the jurisdiction in view
of the emergencies that exist, then any legislative action that has to be taken can only
be taken here.
There is, however, one other point which
I would like to mention for the future consideration, certainly of the members of this
chamber, and possibly even of the Government, although I do not think the Government would particularly listen to any views
that I may haveHon. Mr. Aseltine: I wouldn't say that.
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): I do
think that the honourable gentleman from
Churchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar) has made a
point about the possibly temporary character
of this legislation in so far as the employer
is concerned, because that steamship service
on the British Columbia coast is not only an
essential service but, if I may say so, a most
enjoyable service to use. The trip is a wonderful one to take, and it may very well
belong to an essential part of the transportation system of this country.
I understand the Minister of Justice rather
indicated in the other place, when this measure
was under consideration, that from a jurisdictional point of view Parliament was entitled on that score to pass the bill. But
it may be that this company is being forced,

JULY 25, 1958
or will now be forced, to meet the deficits
of this operation for an indefinite period of
time, and particularly if the wage rates are
to increase. So the Urne may corne when
perhaps the whole service will have to be
taken over as a public project in the interests
of the entire country. There would be a
precedent for that, because there is a provision in the British North America Act
whereby Prince Edward Island and Newfoundland were brought into Confederation,
that the ferry services between the mainland
and those two provinces will be maintained;
and while the language of the sections does
not explicitly say so, I think the interpretation
has always been that it is compulsory for
these services to be maintained and that they
cannot be struck, as this one has been.
I would like to mention another point,
arising also out of section 4 of the bill-and I
do not do so in any carping, critical. way.
Section 4 says that every employee who is
now on strike shail return to the duties
of his employment. I should think that
what was in the mind of the framer of this
piece of legisiation was, and probably the
Government people would say so, that the
parties agree they cannot get together on
this strike, but that if a bill of this kind
were passed the service would be resumed
under certain conditions, and that then, in
the normal course of events, the people who
have gone on strike against the company
would return to work. And I think that
will happen. It may have been necessary
to put a section like this in the bill; but I
would draw to honourable senators' attention
the fact that this section does what contract
law cannot do, that is, enforce a provision
for the performance of personal services.
That may not be a desirable precedent for
legisiation, either dominion or provincial-

or competent legisiature said that every
lawyer in Canada shail practîce law for eight
hours a day regardiess of what he might
otherwise be doing. That would be a legal
prescription irnposing conditions as to personal services, personal activity. In the old
days of slavery perhaps that kind of thing
could be done.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I arn sure my honourable friend would flot mind that, for I amn
certain he practises more than eight hours
a day now.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: I was just going to say
that we lawyers work longer hours than that.
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): Well,
what I had in mind in my example was that
if the honourable Leader of the Governrnent
was required to spend eight hours a day in
his law office we would not have the benefit
and pleasure of his company here; and the
sarne comment would apply to other lawyers
in this chamber.
Honourable senators, this section, which
deals with the personal activities of individuals in that it requires them. to return to
their duties of ernployment, may have a very
far-reaching effect. On other occasions, perhaps, we might think about it a littie more
carefully before we solemnly pass it into the
law of this country.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, is it your pleasure to pass the bill?
Borne Hon. Senatars: Carried.

SENATE PRAYERS
REFERENCE TO PRINCE CHARLES AS
PRINCE OF WALES

Hon. W. M. Aseltine: Honourable senators,
before we proceed with the ordinary business
of the day I would like to make a brief
announcement. Had we been in session on
Saturday last I would have announced in
this chamber the very interesting and important information then received to the
effect that our Prince Charles had just been
proclaimed "Prince of Wales" by Her
Gracious Majesty Queen Elizabeth Il.
My mind goes back to the visits to this
country in the early 1920's by Edward Prince
of Wales and the tremendous ovations he
received when be visited western Canada on
the way to his Prince of Wales Ranch in
Alberta. He later became Edward VIII. Now
at last we have another Prince of Wales,
Prince Charles, who is nine years of age, who
will not be invested until he is older, at
which time I sincerely hope that he will pay
us a visit in Canada.
I am sure, honourable senators, that news
of the honour which bas been conferred on
our young Prince will be received with rejoicing in all parts of the commonwealth.
We in this chamber also rejoice in the event,
and desire to express our congratulations and
best wishes to the new Prince of Wales, and
say "God Bless the Prince of Wales".
Honourable senators, last Sunday was the
first time in 22 years that prayers have been
said in the churches for the Prince of Wales.
The wording of our opening prayer will have
to be altered, and I would like to have the
approval of the bouse to the appropriate
change. Therefore, with the leave of the
Senate, I move the following motion,
seconded by the Honourable Senator W.
Ross Macdonald, P.C.:
That the words "Charles Prince of Wales" be
substituted for the words "Charles Duke of Cornwall" where they appear in the 25th and 26th
lines of the prayers said at the opening of each
sitting of the Senate.

young and old, and from every walk of life,
have followed with deep interest and affection his progress from babyhood to boyhood,
and I am sure that our interest and affection
will continue to deepen throughout the
glorious years that lie before him.
We trust that be will grow in strength and
wisdom and that our Heavenly Father will
continue to support him throughout his life.
May I also add that we hope it won't be
too many years before the Prince of Wales
pays a visit to Canada.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I second the motion.
(Translation):
Hon. Cyrille Vaillancour: Honourable
senators, I deem it my duty to express in
French our gratitude and loyalty toward our
sovereign for the great honour she has conferred upon her son in naming him Prince of
Wales.
Both our leaders have recalled the visit
of our former King when he came to Canada
as Prince of Wales. Now it is our sovereign's
son who is the Prince of Wales and thus
symbolizes the union of the commonwealth.
If ever that symbol were to disappear, it
would be the end of the fraternal and peaceful feeling that exists today.
In naming her son Prince of Wales, not
only does the Queen of England confer an
honour upon him, but she perpetuates thereby
that symbol of peace as well as the faith we
French Canadians and all Canadians have
in the peace we strive for and in the royal
family, whom we appreciate and we will continue to admire increasingly so long as it is
represented by as gracious a person as our
present Queen.
My leader has just said that he hopes the
Prince of Wales will soon come to visit us.
I too hope that he will come soon, so that
we may know and appreciate our new Prince,
just as we came to appreciate our present
Queen when she came to Canada as a princess, even though, needless to say, our
admiration for her deepened when she became
our Queen. It is when she visited Canada
that we had an opportunity to meet ber and
to appreciate ber fine qualities as a
sovereign.

CONGRESS FOR WORLD GOVERNMENT
INQUIRY AND ANSWER

Hon. W. M. Aselline: Honourable senators,
on July 22 last the honourable senator from
De la Durantaye (Hon. Mr. Pouliot) asked the
following question:
-Honourable senators, I presumne that anl of you

have received an elaborate invitation £rom the
Seventh World Congress of the World Association
of Parliamentarians for World Government. It la
eiaborate and fiashy. I wonder if that organization
tor world Government has the support of the
Canadian Governmnent and if the Canadian Government is sending delegates to that conference, which
wvill take place in September next. I know that the
Acting Leader of the Government (Hon. Mr. Monette> is not in a position to answer me at once
but I hope that he will be klnd enough to get
In touch wlth the proper authority In order to
let us have that information as soon as possible.

I now have the reply which. is as follows:
1. The Canadian Governmnent has no officiai
relations with the World Association of Parliamentarians for World Government. The
association, I understand, relies on the support of individual members of legisiative
assemblies in various countries.
2. The Canadian Government as such has
not received a formai invitation to attend and
does not expect to send officiai delegates to
the association's conference next September.

PRIVATE BILL

MID-CONTINENT PIPELINES LIMITEDSECOND READING
Hon. William R. Bruni moved the second
reading of Bill S-15, respecting Mid-Continent
Pipelines Limited.
He said: Honourable senators, this is a
short bill, which deals with a Canadian company known as the Mid-Continent Pipe Lines
Limited. This company was originally incorporated under the laws of the Dominion
of Canada by chapter 68, statutes of 1952-53.
The head office of the company is in the city of
Regina, province of Saskatchewan.
This bill is a very simple one and therefore
it will be necessary to give only a short
explanation in connection with it.
Under clause 1 of the bill it is proposed
to change the capital structure of this company. The share capital of the company
originally consisted of 5 million shares without nominal or par value. Of the 5 million
shares, 200,000 shares have been issued, so
that the present proportion between issued
and unissued shares is 2 to 48. Under this
bill it is proposed to cancel 100,000 shares of
the stock already issued and, in view of the
fact that the shares held by each of the
present shareholders of the company are held
in even numbers, no question of fractional
shares arises. Upon cancellation of the aforesaid 100,000 shares each shareholder will
then hold one share for every two now held.
It is then proposed, by clause 1 of the bill,
to create an additional 100,000 shares without
nominal or par value so that the capitalization of the company will remain the same,
namely, it will consist of 5 million shares of
which 100,000 will have been issued, and
4,900,000 will remain in the treasury. Under

this proposed amendment the proportion between issued shares and unissued shares will
be 1 to 49. The company feels that this is a
necessary amendment and will assist it with
the financing of its future operations.
Clause 2 of the bill is of more importance;
it proposes three changes. Under the original
act of incorporation this company was allowed
to construct pipe lines and transport oil and
gas within Canada. The company desires an
extension of its powers so that it may be able
to transport oil and gas outside of Canada as
well as within Canada. To that end the company is now asking that clause (a) of section 6
of chapter 68 of the 1952-53 Statutes be
amended by adding the words "or outside"
after the word "within". If that amendment
is made the company can then proceed to
construct a pipe line, if necessary, outside of
Canada.
The next change relates to the same clause,
and the company is asking that the words
"extra-provincial and/or international" be
added, to the clause, which would then read
in part as follows:
-and
ail interprovincial, extra-provincial and/or
international pipe Unes and ail appurtenances relative thereto for gathering, transmitting, transporting, storing and delivering of natural and arti-

fìcial gas and oil-

Actually this amendment will allow the
company to construct and operate extraprovincial and international pipe lines for
the transmission of gas and oil outside as
well as within Canada, and being in addition to its present right of operating interprovincial pipe lines.
The right to operate interprovincial pipe
lines is necessary if the company is to carry
on a successful pipe line business, and
"extra-provincial" is being added in order
to give the company the right to transport
oil and gas from wells in the Hudson Bay,
which is not located in any province, and
in the Pacific Ocean beyond the three-mile
limit; and it would give greater clarity, so
there would be no doubt that the company
would have the right to transport oil and
gas from wells in the Yukon and Northwest
Territories.
Honourable senators, I come now to the
third change which this company is requesting, namely, that the following words be
deleted from the present act:
Provided that al pipelines for transmission and
transportation of gas and oil shall be located
entirely within Canada.

I am sure all honourable senators realize
that this company can never have the right
to transport oil to the United States as long
as that clause remains in the act under
which it was incorporated.
May I point out to honourable senators
that this company has built and has in

JULY 29, 1958
operation a gas pipe line between the provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan. The
gas pipe line which it now owns and
operates is used to transmit and transport
gas from the Medicine Hat-Many Islands
fields in Alberta and to feed it into the gas
distribution system which is now operated
by the Saskatchewan Power Corporation in
the province of Saskatchewan.
Finally, I think I might advise honourable
senators that all of the directors of this
company are Canadians.
Hon. Gordon B. Isnor: Honourable senators, I am not clear on one question. As I
understand it, under the amendment this
company would be given authority to construct plants in the United States. In that
case, would all the directors of the new
operation in the United States be Canadians?
Hon. Mr. Bruni: Oh, no, I could not give
any such assurance as that, because no doubt
such an operation would be conducted by a
subsidiary company, and I would think there
would be at least some American directors
on its board.

present time? If the honourable gentleman
does not know the answer, I will expect it
in committee.
In addition to that, I am somewhat confused
about section 1 of the bill. I understand these
people are asking us to change the par value
per share. I do not quite know what right
we have to interfere with the rights of shareholders. Just what this section means is not
clear to me. If it means that we are by statute
attempting to cut down the holdings of shareholders, even though the value may appear
to be the same, that is one thing. If we are
giving permission to the company to have
a meeting of shareholders to do it, that is
another matter entirely. The section may
raise a matter that I have not heard raised
in Parliament for a very long time.
Hon. A. K. Hugessen: Honourable senators, with regard to the question raised by
the honourable senator from Toronto-Spadina (Hon. Mr. Crol), it seems to me to be
quite clear from the bill that the company
is proposing to ask Parliament to state that
for every two shares each shareholder now
holds he will in future hold one share. I
think that will be proper, provided the
company can establish to us in committee
that all the shareholders have agreed to it.
Hon. Mr. Croll: That is my point. Watch
out for that!
Motion agreed to and bill read second
time.

Hon. Mr. Isnor: That is the very point that
is raised time and time again in regard to
American companies operating in Canada.
Here the situation is reversed, and I was
wondering if the honourable senator was in
a position to give us an assurance that there
will not be a majority of American directors
in the subsidiary company.
Hon. Mr. Bruni: I am sorry, I cannot give

company.
Hon. Mr. Isnor: I have another question
to ask: Would the Board of Transport Commissioners have control over the issuing of
the licence, and if so how would that affect
the American operation?
Hon. Mr. Bruni: The company would have
to get permission of the Board of Transport
Commissioners to export gas and oil, and
the board would lay down the conditions
under which the exporting could be done. If
this bill passes, that will not give the company the right ipso facto to export gas and
oil. The company would have to go before
the Board of Transport Commissioners and
obtain leave to export, and the board would
impose the appropriate terms.
Hon. David A. Croll: When the bill was
passed, in 1952, why were not these provisions
included in the bill at that time te give the
company the power it is asking for at the

SECOND READING

Hon. R. B. Horner moved the second reading of Bill C-40, to amend the Prairie Farm
Assistance Act.
He said: Honourable senators, although
I am confident that honourable senators
thoroughly understand this measure and the
many good features in the proposed amendments contained in the bill, perhaps it would
be in order to give a short explanation of
it, commencing with a brief history of the
background.
In the great grain-growing parts of western
Canada some areas havt. occasionally suffered drought and farmers have been left
with insufficient return from their crops to
pay taxes and expenses. When this act first
came into being it was hoped that the 1 per
cent levy on all grain sold-I say all grain,
but until now flaxseed and rapeseed were
exempt-would have been sufficient to cover

SENATE
all disbursements. That has not turned out
to be so. In the amendments proposed in
this bill flaxseed and rapeseed are now to
be subject to the levy. This was decided
on because growers of those crops benefit
under the act in a year of crop failure.
Some of the proposed amendments might
result in higher costs but other amendments will probably bring about some
reduction. A 1 per cent levy on flaxseed
and rapeseed will add very greatly to the
grand total because these crops are now
grown in large quantity.
I might mention that there have been a
great many complaints about the size of areas
eligible for award. The complaints were to
the effect that under the act the area to make
a township eligible for award was too large.
These amendments will reduce the area.
I will read section 6 as it will read according to the proposed amendment:
Nothwithstanding anything in this Act
(a) where a section of land, or a settlement or
river lot in a group declared to be a township
for the purposes of this act, or a block of sections
or settlement or river lots in one or more of such
groups, having a side that lies along the boundary
of an eligible township, is determined by the board
to have an average yield of eight bushels of wheat
or less per acre, such section or settlement or
river lot or block of sections, settlement or river
lots is eligible for award as though it were a complete township;-

apart from large mortgage companies and so
on, will receive award payments as though
they lived on the farm.
There have been complaints from farmers
that the minimum area eligible, namely, onehalf of a township, was too large. It is proposed by this amending bill to reduce the
eligible area to one-third of a township. Other
amendments of that nature, it is believed, will
result in smoother operation of the act.
There is another provision in the present
act to the effect that Crown lands acquired
since 1940 were not eligible for an award.
This bill will make Crown lands eligible.
Many sections of land throughout the years
have not been eligible for payments because
a good deal of our land in Saskatchewan not
considered good for wheat growing was transformed into pastures, but a great deal of this
Crown land is really good producing land and
grain grown on it has been paying the levy
all along. This bill will enable awards to be
paid. The thought here is that any additional
costs by way of awards will be offset by the
fact that the appraisers will be relieved of the
difficulty and cost of obtaining information
as to whether the land in question is Crown
land or not. They have had to search titles
and all that sort of thing, so it is considered
that this amendment will not add any cost
and will, on the other hand, make the act
more convenient to administer.
Coarse grains are to be eligible in areas
where less than 10 per cent of the area is
sown to wheat. Oats, barley and coarse grains
are to qualify in the same manner as wheat.
Oats and barley have been paying the 1 per
cent levy, and by this bill flaxseed and rapeseed are to be subject to the 1 per cent levy,
as I pointed out before.
Al the amendments are self-explanatory
and honourable senators will, I think, readily
understand the purpose of them. If there are
any questions honourable senators would like
to ask, I think possibly I have the answers.
I do not know that it is necessary to send
this bill to committee, but it will be all right
to do so if that is the wish of the house.
However, I believe it could very well receive
third reading tonight.
Hon. John T. Haig: I would like to have
this bill referred to committee. Our province
of Manitoba has a little trouble; we are big
payers of this levy and very small receivers.
If it goes to committee we can find out a
little information about that.

So much for the alterations to the areas.
There is one saving feature, that some
money will be saved through these amendments. From time to time a good deal of dissatisfaction was caused by the fact that rain
does not always fall evenly on an area, and
in a particular area that was declared eligible
for an award a farmer might have a 30
bushel per acre crop, but if that entire area
was declared eligible he too received the payment. Now, according to the amendment,
where there is a yield of 12 bushels or more
per acre in a section, the farmer receives no
payment, notwithstanding the fact that he
is within the larger area which has been
declared eligible for an award.
Another amendment in this bill is to cover,
as an example, elevator men who operate
farm's in addition to attending to their duties
at the elevator. Up to the present time owners
of farms not actually living on the farms
were ineligible to receive any payment.
Farmers with other occupations, such as
elevator-operators, who hired workers or themselves worked their farms nights and mornings, during all these years were paying the

and how much it received? How much Saskatchewan paid out and how much it received?
How much Alberta paid and how much it
received?
Hon. Mr. Horner: You want to show your
province in the black. Your province is not
in the red, I can tell you that. The total levy
that has been taken from farmers on their
grain sold amounts to $103,436,470. The disbursements are considerably more than that,
but, as I said, it was hoped in the beginning
that that would not be the case.
Hon. Mr. Croll: Is $103 million a levy or
the total collection?
Hon. Mr. Horner: The total collection of
$103 million comes from the farmers on the
sale of their grain.
Hon. Mr. Croll: Did I not understand the
honourable senator to ask for the total disbursements?
Hon. Mr. Horner: No, the total receipts.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Let me ask this question:
what share of the $103 million did the province of Manitoba contribute, and how much
did it receive out of it? How much did
the provinces of Saskatchewan and Alberta
each contribute, and how much did they
receive?
We in Manitoba are having a little trouble
over this bill. It has been a bone of contention among our farmers for years-I am
not a farmer and I do not pretend to know
all the facts; I only get them second handit has been a bone of contention that Manitoba does all the paying and some other
provinces do all the receiving. Now I would
like to know if that is true or not. I don't
care whether Manitoba pays more than its
share or not, but as a senator from that
province I would like to know the facts, so
that when a farmer comes to me and asks
whether it is true that Manitoba paid in,
say, $40 million and got out $9 million,
whereas Saskatchewan paid in $20 million
and drew $50 million, I want to be able to
answer him intelligently. I think there will
be some questions asked by our farmers over
this legislation.
The farmers of my province believe in
insurance; they know that in any insurance
scheme such as this the man who suffers the
loss gets paid, and everybody pays a basic
premium rate. But that is not quite what
is done here. In this case the money is
taken from each province, good, bad or
indifferent, on the basis of qualifying by
townships. In my province the townships
do not have the right to qualify. If it were
on the basis of sections instead of townships,
we might be better off.
57075-4-27J

These are things I want to know, and
surely I am entitled to ask about them without being joshed and accused of doing something improper.
Hon. Mr. Horner: I will tell the honourable senator.
Hon. Mr. Haig: All I am asking now is that
the bill go to a committee where the officials
can be called to tell me what I want to
know.
Hon. Mr. Horner: I will tell you, if you
will just allow me. The total amount collected from Manitoba is $15,520,884.45; that
province received $1,504,739. But under the
amendments now proposed, as you will see,
you will get benefits for your flooded land.
Let me point out to you that the province
of Manitoba is still part of western Canada,
and this is a co-operative scheme. You in
Manitoba have been fortunate. We in Saskatchewan have had to pay freight across
your province; and even now when we are
shipping grain through Churchill it costs us
15 cents more, and you in Manitoba get the
benefit of that. We give it to you.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: No!
Hon. Mr. Horner: This is a co-operative
business, and the honourable senior senator
from Winnipeg (Hon. Mr. Haig) should consider himself fortunate that he lives in
Manitoba.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I don't object; I am just
asking for information.
Hon. F. W. Gershaw: Honourable senators,
I wish to add a few remarks to the discussion
on these proposed amendments.
I quite agree with the honourable sponsor,
that the amendments are going to greatly
improve the present legislation.
The Prairie Farm Assistance Act was set
up as a relief measure in 1939 and has operated continuously ever since. To put it in
simple terms, it operates this way: the farmer
who has less than three bushels per acre gets
$4 an acre on half of his cultivated acreage
up to 200 acres; on a crop from three to five
bushels per acre, he receives $3 an acre on
half of his acreage up to 200 acres; on from
five to eight bushels, he gets $2. So on that
formula the most he can receive is $800.
The figures given in the other house show
that since the inauguration of this legisIation
some $202 million bas been paid out to the
benefit of the farmers. In that time the
farmers have paid a levy of 1 per cent on
all grains. which amounted to $103 million.
Therefore, about half the benefits received
were paid by the farmers themselves.

SENATE

As I said earlier, this has been a continuing
operation. In 1949, when there was a rather
poor crop, $22 million was paid out. In 1954
some $33 million was paid out, being the
highest amount for any one year. This year
the Prime Minister indicated that it might
run as high as $50 million; he later estimated
it to be probably $39 million. It may now be
even less than that amount, in spite of the
fact that the passage of these amendments
will increase the amount to some extent.
As the honourable senator from Blaine
Lake (Hon. Mr. Horner) has said, this legislation has been a great blessing to many people,
but it still is a cause of a great deal of
frustration and disappointment. Often there
is trouble about delay in getting paid; at
times disputes arise about the exact yield
and about the eligibility of certain areas for
the bonus payments. For instance, a farmer
in an eligible area, with a crop of 9 or 10
bushels per acre, will get the bonus, while
a farmer with two or three bushels per acre
in an ineligible township may not qualify
for payment. These proposed amendments
would put the benefits on a more equitable
basis, by dealing with smaller areas rather
than big townships. For instance, as the
legislation now stands, when a flood condition exists in three or four sections the
farmers in that area do not qualify; benefits
are not paid in areas of less than six sections.
What the farmers cannot understand isand the question was raised here tonightwhy the matter is not dealt with on an
individual basis, so that the man who has
a poor crop can get the dry bonus and the
man who has a big crop does not get it. But
that seems impossible. The previous Government would not allow it, and the present
Government has not proposed it. It should
be remembered that this is not a crop
insurance proposition and never was intended
to be such. It is said that an arrangement
for dealing with each farmer individually
would be too expensive. Perhaps that is
true, although in Alberta and Saskatchewan
the average farm has 537 acres. It has been
recognized all along that isolated cases must
be dealt with by the municipalities.
The minister is hopeful that some system
of crop insurance could be put into effect by
which the farmers would benefit. We in
western Canada wish that could be done,
but it appears to be a difficult proposition.
In the first place, apparently it is ultra vires
of the dominion.

investigations into the whole field, but has
now decided against it. Alberta considered it
from a provincial standpoint, but has done
nothing. The province of Manitoba sent delegates to Ottawa and to the United States to
consider crop insurance, but nothing has
been done about it.
I can understand why Manitoba is particularly interested in this legislation. Up to
1955 that province paid in $13 million and
received back only $8 million; Saskatchewan
paid in $48 million and got out $126 million.
Hon. Mr. Haig: That's what I thought.
Hon. Mr. Gershaw:

We are a little more

modest in Alberta: we paid in $24 million
and got out $42 million. Certainly Manitoba
has paid more than it has received.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Did you include in those
figures the land that the Government put in?
Hon. Mr. Gershaw: Oh, yes. During those
years the dominion Government paid almost
two-thirds, and then three-fifths, and at the
present time it is paying about one-half. That
money goes into a fund, out of which the
inspectors and farmers are paid.
As the record shows, and as this legislation
indicates, crop failures occur in the west from
year to year and bring great poverty and
despair. Food is the commodity that is produced out there, and whenever the food
supply fails the population dwindles and may
even move by mass migration. That has happened in several places. There is nothing
more depressing than the sight of a deserted
farm. Someone has said:
The house that has echoed a baby's laugh,
And held up his stumbling feet
Is the saddest sight when left alone
That ever the eye shall meet.

That has happened in some cases in the
west, where they have what they call black
blizzards, and on account of the drought the
soil becomes powdery and crumbles and blows
away in the dust storms. This results in
drifts of soil and seed and brings very serious trouble. At one time in the 1930's there
was no food for the cattle and half a million
head of cattle had to be moved out of the
west altogether. They were sold for from
half a cent to one cent per pound, and the
result was that the breeding herds disappeared and thousands of cattle were ruined.
The Prairie Farm Assistance Act is one
measure designed for helping the farmers in
the west, but there are other measures that
can be helpful too. For instance, irrigation
has been a great blessing to many westerners.
Hon. Mr. Croll: Did I understand my friend It takes 40 acres of range land to feed one
correctly to say that it is ultra vires of the steer, but if those 40 acres are irrigated they

mile, but when the land, or a portion of it,
is irrigated, the population increases to, say,
48 people per square mile. Under these last
conditions there is a chance to establish
schools, churches, hospitals, telephone communication, and so on, and the people are
able to enjoy some measure of community
life.
There is another advantage. Wheat is the
most drought-resistant crop we have and that
is why many westerners specialize in wheat
farming, but in irrigated areas the farmer
can also grow alfalfa, peas, beans, carrotsvegetables of all kinds-and fruits and
flowers. He can raise livestock and poultry
and have all the protecting foods that anyone
needs.
Then there is another consideration. West
of Alberta are the Rocky Mountains and a
lot of mountain streams flow down the eastern slope of the Rockies: the Red Deer, the
Bow, the Waterton, St. Mary's, the Milk
River and others. Some of the water from
these rivers can easily be dammed up in
reservoirs and used to irrigate much of the
adjacent land. Of course, these reservoirs
cannot irrigate land that is too far away, for
if water has to travel too far in these ditches
there is a tremendous loss from seepage and
evaporation. The St. Mary's River dam, which
is one of the largest we have, is situated 30
miles south of Lethbridge, within the very
sight of the foothills of the Rockies. This
huge reservoir, which irrigates approximately
425,000 acres of land, was built at a cost of
about $40 per acre. The Bow River system,
which irrigates about 180,000 acres, was put
in at a cost of about $22 to $25 an acre. The
Red Deer system, which irrigates some
400,000 acres, cost $10 million, about $25 per
acre, to put into operation. So some of these
schemes have been put in at a relatively low
cost and have been very essential to the life
out there. Some years ago the Meek Report
was published in which it was said that a
farmer could not prosper if it cost him more
than $25 per acre to operate his farm. Since
then a lot of land referred to in that report
has been sold as cheaply as $12 per acre. But
not all the schemes have been successful and
many farmers are still having a pretty hard
time.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Who paid for the
cost of putting in these systems?
Hon. Mr. Gershaw: The dominion Government paid for the main reservoirs and connecting canals, and the money spent for this
purpose is not recoverable. The province distributes the water from the main canals and
recovers what money it can from the farmers.
It is a three-way proposition.

In the early days of the century some
British businessmen invested $14 million in an
irrigation scheme in western Canada. They
never received any dividends and about three
years ago they sold out to the dominion
Government for $2J million, and they were
glad to get out.
Then the C.P.R. irrigated 250,000 acres of
land in the Western Irrigation District. The
farmers didn't think they needed the water
and the ditches gradually filled up, and today
there are 50,000 acres of irrigated land out
there. It has been a tremendous loss to the
C.P.R. The Eastern Irrigation District, which
has been a reasonably successful one, was
put in by the C.P.R. They kept working it
for a long time and were losing money.
Finally they said to the farmers, "We will
give you the whole project" and the farmers
said, "Oh, no, you give us $300,000 in cash
money and we will take the project."
The University of Alberta published a
pamphlet recently on this subject, and they
referred to some other irrigated districts
which have not been successful. They indicated they have read the Prairie Farm
Assistance legislation and they find that some
areas have a crop failure at least threequarters of the time, or in 75 per cent of
the cases, and that irrigation or some other
means should be provided to give the people
in those areas a good living.
What I am urging is that these irrigation
schemes and this Prairie Farm Assistance
legislation have been in operation quite a
while and that the time has come when they
should be re-assessed. There should be a
complete investigation. Perhaps this could be
done by the Senate's Special Committee on
Land Use in Canada. Whatever investigation
is made, the irrigation engineers and the people who actually live in and manage those
districts in the west should be consulted. They
know the difficulties of looking after the
crops out there, and how uncertain conditions are. I refer to men like Ted Salter,
Mr. Main, the Hon. Mr. Taggart, Carl J.
Anderson, and a number of others.
In any review of the situation an estimate
should be made of the amount of water
available for irrigation purposes, just what
land can be profitably irrigated, where the
land can be irrigated by use of gravity, and
where pump lifts must be installed to get
the water onto the land. Then something
must be done about types of land. Some
land needs to be irrigated, some land needs
to be put into community pasture, and some
land should be abandoned altogether. Irrigated land requires a special type of farming
and the farmers who go on the land require
some special training. There should be
some demonstration plots, so that the best

SENATE
farming practices could be tallied up. Perhaps each farmer should have an irrigated
plot and some dry land.
Again, the question of capital cost has to

tioned cost from $25 to $40 per acre, and
even that is pretty high. Then it bas to be
decided what proportions are to be paid by
the dominion Government, by the provincial
Government, and by the farmer, for it has
been well established that in Canada as well
as in the United States the farmer cannot
pay the capital costs of bringing water to
his land.
There is one other problem, and it is the
main one I have in mind. Something has
to be done to obtain markets for the products. Splendid crops can bc produced on
irrigated land, with adequate sunshine, and
when the ditches are put in the district
should not be deserted. It is also necessary,
in order to have the products available all
the year around, to have canning factories,
processing factories, storage factories, and
refrigeration for crops that are grown for
sale.

sugar, yet only 20 per cent comes from
homegrown beets. In this land where there
is so much sunshine and where beets have
so high a sugar content some arrangement
should be made whereby we would use more
sugar produced from beets and less imported
cane sugar. Men and women who live on
sugar farms work long hours and very hard,
and it seems that a reassessment should be
made to enable them to continue to enjoy
the charms and contentment of rural life.
These people should be relieved of the constant fear of disaster and given some assurance against complete failure of crop.

I should point out, of course, that the total

full settlement from the companies. When
that occurs, Manitoba may again be in the
red this fall.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: What are the figures for
Saskatchewan?
Hon. Mr. Horner: The total amount collected from Saskatchewan is $58,416,367.39.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: What is the total amount

Hon. Mr. Crerar: And what were the total

Hon. Mr. Horner: $49,358,157.30.
Hon. Mr. Croll: Honourable senators, may
I suggest that in order that the rest of us
may be able to follow these figures, the tables
be put on Hansard?
Hon. Senators: Agreed.
Sec appendix to today's Hansard, pp. 430-1.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I had one or two questions
to ask, but J was interrupted. I understood
the honourable senator from Blaine Lake to
say that Manitoba paid in $13 million and got
$18 million.
Hon. Mr. Horner: Oh, no.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Let us get the exact figures
from the officials. What is there to hide?
Surely this bouse is fair enough to let the
province of Manitoba know what they are
paying? The figures fron this report are
being given haphazardly. J want exact figures
that I can rely on. If it is net desired to give
the figures, I can get them from the officials.
I think J am entitled to what I am asking
for.
Hon. T. A. Crerar: Honourable senators, I
suspect that a good deal of the information
that is being sought will be found in the last
annual report on the administration of this
act, although I do net know, because I must
confess that J have not looked at it.
There are a few features of this legislation
which probably might be worth consideration.
This act has been in effect for about twenty
years, and was enacted by a Liberal Government, which was generally regarded as a
good government-and I do not deny that,
honourable senators, because I was a member of it at that time. At first the act was
viewed more as a relief measure. Members
of this honourable house who were not
familiar with the conditions in the Prairie
provinces in the black thirties, as they are
now universally called, have little comprehension of the condition of a very large section of agriculture in the west during those
years. Relief was paid out in large measure
by the administration of the late Lord Bennett, when he was Prime Minister of Canada.
After that, consideration was given to finding
a formula, if possible, that would obviate the
need of passing legislation session by session
for relief, and thus this Prairie Farm Assistance Act was evolved. The principle upon
which it was based was that if in any year
crop yields declined below a certain point
over a certain acreage, the Prairie Farm
Assistance Act would come into operation on

JULY 29, 1958
the scale of relief that was worked out. As
is inevitable in all legislation, it is impossible
to see when it is being drafted what the ultimate consequences of it will be. Indeed, I
sometimes think that the real test of statesmanship among legislators is their ability to
foresee what the consequences will be, ten or
fifteen or twenty years from now, of the acts
they do today.
That, to my mind, is the very essence of
statesmanship. Of course I am bound to say
that I for one never expected that this thing
would grow te the degree it has.
The honourable senator from Blaine Lake
(Hon. Mr. Horner), who explained this bill,
told us that the total benefits paid out over
the 20 years was approximately, or a little
in excess of, $200 million. By simple arithmetic that means an average of $10 million
a year.
It is a fact that from 1940 or 1941 down to
the present year crops in western Canada as
a whole have been above average. Indeed,
the degree to which we grew grain successfully over that period of around 15 or 16
years contributed to the problem of the
western farmer from another angle.
It
created surpluses.
Parliament has been
wrestling with these surpluses, and we are
paying out quite substantial sums every year
from our treasury to help carry them. So,
we have this rather anomalous situation, that
if we get big crops and build up surpluses
the federal Government bas to assist in
carrying them, and if we get light crops, or
no crops, the federal Government also has
to pay on that account.
I do not want this to be taken necessarily
as a criticism of this bill, but I do think
the time has come when we should have a
new look, a fresh look, at this whole problem.
It is quite true that you might have a
very good crop over the vast extent of the
western prairies and still find some locality
here, there or elsewhere where the crop
was a partial faiure; but, generally speaking,
-I think my honourable friend from Blaine
Lake will agree with this-that situation has
not obtained in any substantial degree over
the last 15 years during which we have had,
as I said a moment ago, unusually good crops.
I recall the early days. Crop failures are
not something of recent origin. Bear in mind
that for 70 years farmers have been growing
grain in the prairie country, and for the last
60 years in very large and ever increasing
measure. There were occasions in the early
years when we had crop failures, but in
those days we had a little different outlook.
I venture te say there was a little more selfreliance then; there was no fairy godmother
of a Government to come along and pull

farmers or anyone else out of the hole, if
they happened to drop into it a bit. They
had to struggle out of it themselves. However, we are in the modern concept that has
developed over the years. Governments are
now looking after the farmers. I sometimes
think that if I live for another 25 years, as
I think the honourable senator from Hanover
(Hon. Mr. Brunt) will, we may well see
further great transformations from what we
see today.
Hon. Mr. Bruni: I can only hope that you
will be here then.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: Twenty-five years from
now the Government may well be looking
after every one of its citizens and telling
them what they should do, because the
latter unquestionably must follow the former.
But coming back again to the bill: it
extends the benefits. By that I mean that
under this bill we increase the amounts
that will be distributed.
Hon. Mr. Horner: The awards will be
curtailed in some instances.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: In one instance.
Hon. Mr. Horner: That is a very important
one. I think it will make a great difference.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: But I think the general
effect of it will be to broaden the benefits
of the legislation. That may or may not
be a good thing. If we are going to have
legislation of this kind it may be a good
thing.
There is another feature of this bill that
interests me very much. I agree with my
colleague the senior senator from Winnipeg
(Hon. Mr. Haig) that Manitoba has paid
into this fund more than it has received
out of it.
Hon. Mr. Horner: When this year is over
it may be about equal.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: What is wrong with
the farmers of Manitoba paying in more than
they got out of it?
Hon. Mr. Crerar: Well of course, that is
the principle embodied in this law. My
honourable friend the Leader of the Government (Hon. Mr. Aseltine) evidently thinks
that principle should have a wide application, and it certainly has in this bill. But
there are districts in Manitoba that have
never had a crop failure.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: We have some such
areas in Saskatchewan too.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: Well, that kind of a
district pays the shot for the benefits that
go to the farmer who is growing grain in
an area where he should never have been
growing grain at all. If a farmer by his

SENATE

free choice goes to a district where he knows
that the crops may be uncertain, where
drought is liable to strike, is it the fault of
society that he does that, or is it his own
fault?
Hon. Mr. Horner: The honourable senator
knows there are districts where that occasionally occurs, and in some of the best parts
of western Canada.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: I know that and I know
in those particular districts if you get three
good crops you can stand one poor one.
Hon. Mr. Horner: Well, you paid for it in
your levy.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: The levy is paid, of
course.
Well, I am interested in farming in
Manitoba, and when I bought land I tried to
use ordinary good sense in its selection, and
there has never been a complete crop failure
yet on it. But I may remind the honourable
senator from Blaine Lake that I paid for
that benefit in the price I gave for the land.
And after all that, the Government in its
wisdom comes along and in effect says,
"Well,

you must

make your contributions

to this individual who has gone to the sand
plains and is trying to farm on a sand hill."
Now, there is an element of injustice in that.
Hon. Mr. Horner: What is unusual in that?
We do it in other forms of taxation and in
every other line. I can see nothing unusual
about that principle at all.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: Honourable senators, it
grieves me sorely to see the distance down
the socialist road that my honourable friend
from Blaine Lake has travelled.
Some Hon. Senalors: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: When I first came to this

house I thought there was no greater champion of free enterprise than my honourable
friend. How he has changed! It is sad to contemplate.
T come back to the bill. It contains discrimination in another way. Western Canada
is not he only part of the country where
farmers have crop failures from drought and
other causes. I read with interest yesterday
or today that the heaviest rainfall on record
for the month of July has happened in these
regions this month, and this at a time when
farmers are putting up their hay.
Hon. Mr. Bruni: To what district does my
friend refer, the whole of Ontario or the
Ottawa Valley district?
Hon. Mr. Crerar: I am speaking of the district from Ottawa to Montreal, if my honourable friend wishes to be precise in the information he receives.

Now what happens if this hay crop is
lost, as I am sure much of it will be?
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Let Manitoba pay for it.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: I will be kind enough to
say this: whatever measure this Government
may introduce, I do not think it would try
to saddle Manitoba with that loss.
What about the farmers in Nova Scotia
who may lose an apple crop, or the fishermen
in Newfoundland or elsewhere who may have
a bad year? What about the thousands of in-

dividuals in our society who run little businesses and who, because of conditions beyond
their control, operate at a loss? What about
the thousands of bankruptcies that have taken
place in this country over the past few years?
Is the Government justified in saving the
farmer from bankruptcy, and not saving the
small merchant on the corner who has gone
behind and lost all the money he put into
his business?
Honourable senators, I am making this
statement, and I suspect some of my friends
from western Canada will accuse me of being
a traitor to the farmers' interests-which
accusation, I may say, does not bother me the
slightest. I say you can't have legislation of
this kind without discrimination; and, as a
principle in government, discrimination between citizens is an evil thing, wherever it is
found. If we are to maintain what we call
our democratic freedoms, that cannot be done
by following this road.
If we want a crop insurance scheme for the
farmers of western Canada, this has merit, and
is well worth consideration. But if we do
have such a scheme there will be those who
will clamour to have the Government pay the
premiums, and there may be some honourable
members sitting in both houses of Parliament
who will probably support the idea. As I say,
you might have such an insurance scheme,
but I recognize the difficulty of working it
out. It might be a good idea to have the farmers pay the premiums of such a scheme into
a central fund which they themselves controlled, something like a mutual fire insurance
company. In any event, I would hope that
with such a scheme Governments could be
kept out of it. To me it is an amazing circumstance the degree to which our Governments are getting involved in everything.
Soon we will expect them to do everything for
us. We will lose our self-reliance, and then
we will really be ripe for the socialist state.
I do not wish the house to get the impression that I am necessarily opposed to this bill,
in what I have said.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: What?

JULY
Hon. Mr. Crerar: My honourable friend the
Leader of the Government laughs. True, I
have offered some criticism, not so much
of this bill, but of the whole legislation it
seeks to amend. I do feel that the suggestion
made by our honourable colleague from
Medicine Hat (Hon. Mr. Gershaw), that this
whole matter should have a fresh survey, is
a good suggestion. We cannot continue indefinitely paying these benefits out of the
Treasury to western farmers and deny it to
the farmers of other provinces, whose farming operations are of a different kind.
Hon. Mr. Horner: We are not denying it. The
other provinces are getting help. They are
getting the freight paid on our western
grain.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: It is true the other provinces are given help in that way. But I come
back to my point that, in my judgment, you
cannot allow discrimination to continue permanently. That is why I heartily support the
suggestion that, perhaps by a committee of
this house if no other way can be found, this
whole question should be examined afresh
and efforts made to work out something that
is sound in principle and equitable in the
distribution of its benefits.
Hon. W. M. Aseltine: Honourable senators,
I do not intend to speak at any length on
this bill. The honourable senator from Blaine
Lake (Hon. Mr. Horner) and the honourable
senator from Medicine Hat (Hon. Mr. Gershaw) have explained the bill fully and
intelligently.
I am quite sure that passage of these
amendments will not mean that this legislation will cost the country any more than
if they had not been passed. The fact is
that up to the present time flaxseed and
rapeseed growers have not been paying the
1 per cent levy, and there are great acreages
of these crops in western Canada.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: But that acreage will
derive the benefits.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: That acreage has been
getting the benefits up to the present time,
provided it was in a low wheat production
area, but made no contribution. In other
words, the 1 per cent levy was not paid on
the flaxseed and rapeseed marketed. For
that reason, I cannot see why these amendments will mean any greater cost to the
country.
Another point was brought out by the
honourable senator from Medicine Hat,
namely that there was some dissatisfaction
with the manner in which the payments were
made in two instalments, one in December
57075-4-28

and the other in the next year. I understand the bill as presented provides that all
payments will be made in December.
May I say I am in sympathy with the position taken by the honourable senior senator
from Winnipeg (Hon. Mr. Haig) with respect
to Manitoba. If I remember correctly, none
of the land in which I am interested in
Saskatchewan has ever qualified for assistance
under the Prairie Farm Assistance Act;
although we have been paying the levy for 20
years, neither the people who operate the
farms for me nor I have benefited at all.
Hon. David A. Croll: Honourable senators,
it is not usual for me to speak to a bill
headed "Prairie Farm Assistance Act" but I
have enjoyed this debate, particularly the
byplay of the honourable senior senator from
Winnipeg (Hon. Mr. Haig) and the honourable
senator from Blaine Lake (Hon. Mr. Horner).
I realize it is not a private fight and I can
get into it if I want to.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Come on in, the water is
fine.
Hon. Mr. Croll: I rise because of the fall
from grace of my honourable friend from
Churchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar), who took occasion tonight to point to the fall from grace
of the honourable senator from Blaine Lake,
who used to be the great free enterpriser in
and outside of this bouse. But the honourable
gentleman from Churchill, I think, forgot
that it was during the time he was in office,
when he held a cabinet post, that the Prairie
Farm Assistance Act was brought into being.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: I mentioned that at the
outset of my remarks.
Hon. Mr. Croll: Then it merely adds to my
argument that be too has changed his mind.
I made a quick calculation, and from the
figures at my disposal I was able to find
that this assistance to farmers cost the
country $202 million in 20 years. We collected from the 1 per cent levy a total of
$113 million. Thus in 20 years the net cost
bas averaged nearly $5 million a year. That
is the cost of one jet plane, that's all. That
is what we are talking about. We have no
hesitation in spending billions on defence, yet
we quibble about $5 million a year to needy
farmers.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: That was not the
cost 20 years ago.
Hon. Mr. Croll: That is what it is costing
us today, $5 million a year.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: $5 million would
have bought many planes 20 years ago.
Hon. Mr. Bruni: They didn't have jet
planes 20 years ago.

million, and what it was many years ago
wouldn't matter.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: That is the average
over 20 years.
Hon. Mr. Croll: Yes, and it seems to me
that is cheap enough. What troubles meand I would like an answer from the honourable senator from Blaine Lake-is that at
the present time we have hail insurance and
calamity insurance. As a layman I do not
understand why we have not got crop insurance. If a Government can insure household
mortgages why can't it insure crops?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: The householders
pay for the full insurance.
Hon. Mr. Croll: The farmers are paying a
1 per cent levy for the benefits under this act.

protected. If people can come to this Government and ask for business insuranceand that is what a tarifT is-why can't
farmers get crop insurance? Let us all pay.
I don't know what the premium needs to be.
I do not know what it is, and that is why I
would like to hear about it from the honourable senator from Blaine Lake.

Hon. Mr. Macdonald: But the householder
pays the full cost of his insurance.
Hon. Mr. Croll: He may and he may not.
I am not so sure he does. We have not had
calamities such as farmers have encountered.
We may never have them. We have had 10
years of mortgage insurance in this country
and we have had to pay out in only one or
two instances. Consequently we have been
able to build up a surplus fund. There is a
premium that the farmer could pay, even if
it isn't 1 per cent it could be 2 per cent.

Hon. Mr. Aselline: Not wheat, feed grain.

Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Under this bill are
you suggesting that premiums should be
increased?
Hon. Mr. Croll: I am suggesting the pre-

miums should be paid by all farmers. Let
them all pay.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: All over Canada?

Hon. Mr. Horner: I understand that a study
is being made in this respect at the present
time, and the farmers of western Canada
hope to get full farm insurance legislation
in operation as soon as it can be worked out.
Hon. Mr. Croll: That is a promise?
Hon. Cyrille Vaillancourt: The sponsor of
the bill (Hon. Mr. Horner) said that eastern
farmers receive a kind of bonus for transporting wheat.
Hon. Mr. Vaillancouri: For second-grade
feed grain for cattle and hogs farmers in
Quebec, Ontario, and the Maritime provinces
pay 10 cents more than the world market
price for feed grain.
Hon. Mr. Horner: I have never been quite
able to understand that myself, but I merely
remarked that the price of our grain for
feeding purposes will be coming down again.
Motion agreed to and bill read second time.

Hon. Mr. Horner: If it is the wish that this

same way that other parts of the economy are to raise the statutory maximum compensation

JULY 29, 1958
rates for cattle ordered slaughtered in connection with area or herd eradication programs for such diseases as tuberculosis and
brucellosis.
Section 11 of the act reads as follows:
The minister may, from time to time, cause to
be slaughtered animals suffering from infectious
or contagious disease or suspected of being so
affected and animals that are or have been in
contact with or close proximity to a diseased animal,
suspected of being affected by infectious or contagious disease.

This section gives the minister the necessary
authority to order the slaughter of animals.
Subsection (1) of section 12 authorizes the
minister to order compensation to be paid to
the owners of such animals, and subsection
(2) of that section establishes the basis of
compensation. The authorized compensation
to be paid is the market value of the animal
except in the instances of horses and cattle,
for which maximum compensation amounts
are specified by paragraphs (a) and (b).
The amendment, which is to paragraph (b),
limits the exception in the case of cattle
slaughtered pursuant to any area or herd
disease eradication program. The effect of
this will be to permit payment of compensation at market value in such circumstances
as the foot and mouth outbreak in 1952.
While such circumstances are rare, I am
sure honourable senators would agree that
in those instances the owners of cattle which
are ordered slaughtered should receive full
compensation for them.
The most important impact of the amendment will be in relation to compensation
paid under the tuberculosis and brucellosis
eradication program. At the present time the
maximum compensation is $100 for purebred
animals and $40 for grade animals. The
amendment will increase those maximum figures to $140 for purebreds and $70 for
grades.
The restricted area plan for tuberculosis
was introduced in 1922. Areas are established,
usually counties in eastern Canada and municipalities in western Canada, on the recommendation of a provincial minister of
agriculture and following a request to him
by a majority of the cattle owners in the
area. All the cattle in the area are then tested
for tuberculosis, reactors are removed from
herds and if the incidence of tuberculosis
is below one-half of one per cent the area
is accredited. There is also an individual
herd plan, known as the accredited herd
plan, which operates on a somewhat more
stringent basis and which is also entered
into voluntarily by herd owners.
All sections of all provinces are now included in tuberculosis restricted areas. The
57075-4-28j

programs have virtually eliminated tuberculosis from Canadian cattle herds. As an illustration of that, the incidence of tuberculosis in cattle tested has declined from 4
per cent at the start of the program to only
slightly over one-tenth of one per cent last
year.
A similar program for the eradication of
brucellosis, or Bang's disease, was introduced in 1957. Today it operates practically
from coast to coast, and in one or two of
the western provinces the first tests have only
been made this week.
As I have stated, under the amendment
the maximum compensations are raised from
$100 to $140 for purebred cattle, and from
$40 to $70 for grades. The present rates of
compensation have been in effect since 1923.
Everyone will agree there has been a great
change in the price of cattle from 1923 ta
the present time.
I think the last part of paragraph (b) of
section 1 of the bill calls for some explanation. It reads as follows:
-and if the sale of the carcass is unlawful an
additional amount for purebred and grade animals
equal to the value the carcass would have if the
sale were lawful-

As I mentioned earlier, if an animal is
ordered to be slaughtered under the tuberculosis or brucellosis eradication programs
the owner is required to dispose of it for
slaughter and he receives the slaughter value.
All such animals are directed to plants operating under federal meat inspection, where
they are subjected to veterinary post-mortem
examination. When the infection is limited
the infected portions are condemned and the
balance of the carcass is eligible for sale.
The effect of the last part of section 1 is
that if the infection is sufficiently general as
to require the entire carcass to be condemned
an additional compensation may be paid to
the owner to the value the carcass would
have had if it had not been condemned.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Is that in the bill?
Hon. Mr. White: Yes.
Hon. Mr. Burchill: That is in addition to
the $140?
Hon. Mr. White: Yes, in addition ta the
$140.
Section 2 of the bill provides that the
amended compensation rates will become
effective on April 1, 1958. The reason the
amendment is made retroactive to that date,
I am advised by the officials of the department, is that the testing commences generally on April 1, and the veterinarians from
the department move from farm to farm, so
the individual farmer has no control or say
when his cattle will be tested. It would

in my province whereby we could establish
areas having natural boundaries, such as
rivers or forests, where cattle would not be
in close proximity to other cattle outside that
area.
A vote was first taken and if a majority,
say 75 per cent, of the farmers agreed to it,
an area was established and the animals in
that area were tested. Any of them which
reacted to the test were slaughtered and the
farmers bore the expense for the animals so
slaughtered.

hardly be fair that because some farmers
were fortunate enough to have their cattle
tested after the act came into force they alone
should receive the higher rates. The Government felt that, to be fair to all, the amendment should be made retroactive to April 1
of this year, and then it would cover all the
testing for 1958.

The compensation will

Hon. Mr. White: Yes.
Hon. Austin C. Taylor (Wesimorland):
Honourable senators, I should like a little
clarification with regard to the first part of
paragraph (b) in the amendment, but first of
all I will give a brief review of the activities
of the various governments as regards the
disease known as brucellosis. We all recognize
that for many years, under the Animal Contagious Diseases Act, compensation has been
paid in the elimination of diseased or condemned animals, in so far as tuberculosis was
concerned, but as the honourable senator from
Hastings-Frontenac (Hon. Mr. White) said,
brucellosis has been included only as late
as 1957-it was donc by order in council,
I think in April 1957. But before that order
was passed various provinces in Canada had
enacted provincial laws. The one enacted in
my province of New Brunswick was known
as the Eradication of Bang's Disease or
Brucellosis Act. Prior to that, however, an
act was passed for the establishment of
calfhood vaccination areas against brucellosis.
A few years after that a law was enacted

The purpose of the proposed amendment is to
remove the statutory limits on the amount of compensation for cattle slaughtered pursuant to the act,
except when slaughtered pursuant to area or herd
disease eradication programs, in which case the
limits are to be increased.

Am I to interpret that to mean that there
must be other limits, or other compensation,
or the limits would not be removed? I would
ask the honourable senator who introduced
the bill if in the future no testing will be done
except in established areas set up purposely
for
the eradication
of
these
diseases,
particularly brucellosis and tuberculosis?
Hon. Mr. White: If the honourable senator
will look at the explanatory note he will see
that subsection (2) of subsection 12, as
enacted in 1953-54, chapter 12, provides that
the compensation ordered to be paid under
this section for an animal slaughtered under
the provisions of this act shall be the market
value. Now when that was enacted there was
also provision for horses and cattle.
By the present amendment we are taking
out the provision covering cattle, except those
coming under brucellosis and tuberculosis
diseases. Cattle affected by foot and mouth
disease, such as we had in 1952, come under
section 2 of the act, where the compensation
paid shall be the market value. There is no
limit on that. Up until now there has been
a limit of $100 for purebred cattle and $70 for

JULY 29, 1958
grades. That limit will now be eliminated and
ail cattie will be paid for at the market value,
except that the new rates of $140 and $70 will
be paid for cattie slaughtered pursuant to an
area or herd disease eradication program,
which covers only tuberculosis and brucellosis.
Hon. Mr. Taylor <Westmorland): May I ask
if it is the intention of the Government then
to establish the whole country as an area and
do the testing under an area programn in so
far as tuberculosis and brucellosis are concerned?
Hon. Mr. White: 1 arn advised by the
departrnent that the whole country is now
covered as far as tuberculosis is concerned,
and starting this week or within a few days

ail Canada with the exception of Newfoundland will be under the brucellosis test
program.
This program started only last year, and the
figure I gave for April 30, 1957 to April 30,
1958, did flot include Newfoundland, Quebec,
Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta, but
they will ail be in it now, with the exception
of Newfoundland.
Motion agreed to and bill read second tirne.

Routine proceedings.
CANADIAN FARM LOAN BILL
FIRST READING

The Hon. the Speaker informed the Senate

that a message had been received from the
House of Commons with Bill C-38, to amend
the Canadian Farm Loan Act.
Bill read first time.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, when shall this bill be read the second
time?
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Next sitting.
[Later:]
Hon. W. Ross Macdonald: Honourable sen-

ators, earlier today the Senate gave first
reading to Bill C-38, an Act to amend the
Canadian Farm Loan Act. It has been the
practice in the house during this session to
have a short explanation given to bills on
their first reading. We cannot insist upon
this practice being followed, but it occurred
to me that it might be helpful if the honourable Leader of the Government (Hon. Mr.
Aseltine) would give us a brief explanation
of this bill now, if he is in a position to do so.
This would make us more familiar with the
measure when it is called for second reading
tomorrow.
Hon. W. M. Aselline: I am quite prepared
to follow my honourable friend's suggestion
in this case.
Honourable senators are probably aware
that the authorized capital stock of the Canadian Farm Loan Board is now $4 million.
Under the act the Minister of Finance is
authorized to make loans to the board to the
extent of twenty times the par value of the
capital stock, so the total amount the board
can borrow at present is $80 million. The
money is used for long-term loans to farmers,
and as there have been quite a number of
applications the amount now available for
loans is about to run out. By August 15 commitments will probably have been made to
take care of any amount that is then left in
the hands of the board for making loans, and
by October 15 all money for this purpose
will probably be fully expended.

The amendment to the act is a short one
and provides that the capital stock of the
board be increased to $6 million. If this
is done the board will be able to borrow
from the Treasury a total of $120 million, or
$40 million more than at present, for the
purpose of making long-term loans to farmers.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Thank you. I am sure
the statement of the honourable leader will
be most helpful to honourable members when
studying the bill. I am indebted to him for
having given us this information now.

Hon. Mr. Horner: Honourable senators, I

JULY 30, 1958
Hon. John A. McDonald: Honourable senators, before this bill is read the third time
I have an important request to make of the
honourable Leader of the Government in the
Senate (Hon. Mr. Aseltine).
I would ask that between now and the next
session the leader request the appropriate
minister and officials of the Government to
make a study of the Prairie Farm Assistance
Act with a view to having its provisions made
available to the producers of farm products
in the eastern provinces.
As I listened to the discussion on the bill
in committee this morning I was more than
ever convinced that this act could be made
to apply to eastern farmers. I know from
personal experience that they have at times
suffered the loss of their crops and have not
been able to get back anything like their
production costs. I cannot see why the eastern
farmers could not benefit greatly from the
provisions of the act, especially those who
produce apples, potatoes, and other fruit and
vegetable crops. For example, this year the
farmers are suffering greatly with their hay
crop; in some instances the crop is poor
because of drought, and in other instances
the farmers are not able to harvest it in good
condition.
Further, I should like to request that the
act be studied with a view to extending
assistance to eastern farmers in ridding their
lands of surplus fresh water. A good work is
now being done by the Maritime Marshland
Rehabilitation Administration in its reclamation of some of the best land in Canada,
which once was covered by salt water because the aboiteaux and dams had gone out
or were in need of repair. However, the good
work done in this respect does not help
areas in the eastern provinces where the
land is waterlogged with fresh water. I think
the benefits of this act should be made
applicable to eastern farmers.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine:
I shall submit the
remarks of my honourable colleague from
Kings (Hon. Mr. McDonald) to the proper
authorities and ask that they be given careful attention.

ANIMAL CONTAGIOUS DISEASES BILL
THIRD READING

Hon. George S. White moved the third
reading of Bill C-41, to amend the Animal
Contagious Diseases Act.
Hon. Jean-François Pouliot: Honourable
senators, on Thursday I was unavoidably
absent during part of the sitting when a
similar bill was being discussed, and I was
very sorry to have to leave the chamber, but
I had to do so to pay a last tribute of friendship to a very dear friend of mine who
was buried that day. I am not a quitter
and I did not want to desert the battlefield.
Now, there is one thing I want to stress:
it is that I have the highest regard for my
colleagues of the Senate and I would be very
sorry to be misunderstood by them. Some
honourable senators were under the impression that I was pointing my finger at them
when I spoke of the trust and loan companies.
It was far from my mind to do that, and
instead of accusing anybody I took that opportunity to try to defend my colleagues
against all wrong imputations that could
be made. That is very different. Those matters are serious, and I am glad that the
honourable senator from Hanover (Hon. Mr.
Brunt) is back in his seat. I could not very
well understand his argument that some
public legislation should be passed because
it is asked for by private companies. He said
there were many requests from the trust and
loan companies to have the legislation
changed.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Is the honourable senator speaking on the third reading of the
Animal Contagious Diseases Act?
Hon. Mr. Pouliot: Oh, is that it? I thought
the first item on the Order Paper was for the
third reading of a bill to amend the Loan
Companies Act.
The Hon. the Speaker: Oh, no; this is an
act to amend the Animal Contagious Diseases
Act.
Hon. Mr. Pouliot: If it is taken for granted
I will not repeat what I have said. Otherwise, I will have to start again.
The Hon. the Speaker: I am afraid that the
remarks of the honourable senator are very
diseased indeed, but I hope they are not contagious. In any event, I will have to rule
them out of order.
Hon. Mr. Pouliot: There are many sorts of
contagious diseases.
Motion agreed to and bill read third time,

Hon. Jean-François Pouliot:
Honourable
senators, before those bills are passed, I have
a new practical suggestion to make to relieve
my honourable colleagues who sit on the
Divorce Committee. It is impossible to read
ail the evidence taken before the committee.
I realize that the work of our colleagues is
well and carefully done, and their work is
praiseworthy. On the other hand, there is
nothing more similar than the evidence in
each case. It is the same thing-people
found in a room, a half-full bottle, clothes
on the chair, and a sheet that is drawn up.
I am not going to go into any crude details
to shock our lady colleagues. My point is
that I think there would be an easy way to
relieve our colleagues on the Divorce Committee. I suggest that applicants for divorce
establish their domicile or their residence in
one of the eight provinces where there are
divorce courts. It would be so easy for
them; it would be no more trouble for them
than to be in Quebec City or in Montreal,
or anywhere else.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: Would you not have to
change the law of domicile?
Hon. Mr. Pouliot: No. We could try it for
a session, and then we would see how happy
the members of the Divorce Committee would
be. We would gain a lot from that, because
they could give more attention to the public
legislation that comes before us. Now they
are tied in the divorce room listening to
cases that are all alike. Naturally, we
realize that human nature is always the same.
And people do sometimes commit perjury; it
is very hard to prove, but for anyone who has
been attending courts for a few years it is
easy to see. The Clerk could be instructed
to tell petitioners to try their luck in a
provincial court instead of coming here, and
it would be cheaper. The only ones who
would suffer from it would be the investigators, who would have to follow their clients
to another province.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: I do not quite understand
the honourable senator.
What does he
propose, that there be a false domicile alleged
or that these people should reside in some
other province than Quebec and make a new
domicile?
Hon. Mr. Pouliot:

Well, there is no one

who knows better than my honourable and
distinguished friend that some people elect
domicile in the province of Quebec just to
have the privilege of coming here to obtain
a divorce. You have only to see where they

JULY 31, 1958

come from and where they have been married, and so on, and so on, and so on. If the
Senate were to change the rules of the Divorce
Committee and then instruct the Clerk to
notify petitioners that they should try their
luck in another province to have a divorce
we would have the advantage of the full
association of our colleagues, for whom I
have the greatest regard and admiration, and
then we would be able to work together for
better legislation in the Senate Chamber. I
do not say that to depreciate any one of my
colleagues; I want to be clear about that. I
know that what they do is painstaking, ungrateful, tiresome, et cetera, et cetera, et
cetera. I know that. But on the other hand
I think that they would be happier and they
would have the sense of doing their duty
when they would not be required to attend
to that job, which they perform to the best of
their ability.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Honourable senators,
the suggestion made by the honourable senator from De la Durantaye (Hon. Mr. Pouliot)
would not work at all. How could a person
domiciled in the province of Quebec start an
action for divorce in the province of Ontario?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Why select Ontario?
Why not select Saskatchewan?
Hon. Mr. Aselline:
example.

I am just giving an

Hon. Mr. Haig: Let him come to Manitoba
if he would like to.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: How could a person
domiciled in the province of Quebec start a
divorce action in the province of Ontario or
in any other province when the law of every
province that has a divorce court requires the
petitioner to be domiciled in the province
before the court has any jurisdiction to hear
his case?
Hon. Arthur W. Roebuck: Honourable
senators, as far as I can make out, my friend
does not suggest that a false domicile be
secured by anyone, or that the law be
changed to give domicile elsewhere than in
the province of Quebec to people who reside
there. As far as I can follow what my friend
said, it was that people claimed domicile in
the province of Quebec when they did not
properly possess it, in order to present a
petition to Parliament.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: I did not get that meaning out of what he said.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: I think that is what he
suggested.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: That would cover only
the odd case.

Hon. Mr. Roebuck: It would be a very odd
case. I have never yet seen a case where I
doubted a domicile because of the evidence
that was given. No vigilance on our part in
that regard would bring about any reduction
in the number of petitioners, and certainly it
would not be advisable to change the law to
permit a petitioner to claim a domicile other
than his true one, because that would be contrary to all the traditions of our courts.
Furthermore, I do not suppose there is
anybody in one of the provinces where there
is a divorce court who would petition Parliament for a divorce, because it is very much
more expensive to get a divorce from this
jurisdiction than it is from a provincial court.
My friend expresses regard for the work
done by the Divorce Committee, and for that
I thank him. The committee has never had
any reason to complain of the appreciation
of this house, which has been expressed on
many occasions, and I can assure honourable
members that their attitude goes a long way
toward satisfying the members of the committee in the task which they perform. They
highly appreciate the attitude of their fellow
senators in this regard.
My friend attacks the cases as being similar. Well, it must be borne in mind that
every application for divorce is for the same
remedy, and that every one of the petitions
is supported by the same allegation--commission of adultery-so there would necessarily be a similarity between every case.
But if my friend suggests there is a great
similarity between the evidence that is
presented in each case and which the members of the committee are called upon to
weigh, he is in error. My friend has never
sat in the Divorce Committee or he would
realize that each case is separate and distinct, concerned with human beings and all
the complications that may arise in married
life. I can assure him that every case that
comes before our committee or its various
subcommittees is listened to with the greatest
of care and not handled in a routine way at
all. Every case is considered on the merits
of the evidence presented, and the evidence
in any one case is different from that in
every other case. Numerous problems come
before us as we hear these cases, real problems, which we are called upon to solve and
with which this chamber very seldom is
acquainted.
The committee is nearing the conclusion
of its sittings and we have almost reached
the bottom of the barrel. At the last sitting,
which was on Monday of this week, only 13
cases were ready to be heard. We could
have handled a good many more than that.
We are sitting again tomorrow, but I do not

SENATE
know what the program is, other than it
will not be a very large one. The committee's final sitting of the session will be on
the 8th of August, by which time we shall
have heard all the cases that are completed
and ready to be heard. I shall be very glad
to see the last of it.
Of course, I realize the truth of what my
honourable friend from De la Durantaye
(Hon. Mr. Pouliot) says, that the time we
spend on divorce work might very well be
spent on something more worth while. That
is truc. My colleagues all know that this
is a job that is imposed upon the Senate,
and so long as it is imposed upon us we will
do it to the very best of our ability and with
very little complaint. There is pleasure in
the work, quite aside from the ribald and
tawdry stories that we hear. A good spirit
prevails among the members of that committee, a certain esprit de corps, and the
satisfaction of knowing that we are doing
this work to the best of our ability.
So it is net such a penalty to belong to
this committee. There are compensations. I
do hope however, that next session a few
more members will be appointed to the committee, because this session we have been
We

need a little larger conmittee of active,
working members, and I am sure that will
be attended to at the next session.
I thank my honourable friend from De la
Durantaye for the kindness of his attitude and
for his favourable remarks about the members
of my committee.
Hon. Mr. Pouliot: Honourable senators, in
view of what has been said I will have to
work hard to try to find another suggestion
that will be acceptable.
Motion agreed to and bills read third time
and passed, on division.
CANADIAN

FARM LOAN BILL

SECOND

READING

Hon. W. M. Aseltine moved the second
reading of Bill C-38, to amend the Canadian
Farm Loan Act.
He said: Honourable senators will recall
that yesterday I gave the bouse a brief explanation of the amendment which this
bill proposes to the Canadian Farm Loan Act.
Perhaps I should now restate briefly the
reasons for the amendment.
The Canadian Farm Loan Board as at present constituted has only one shareholder,
namely, the Government of Canada. At the
present time the capital stock of the board
amounts to $4 million. Under the act the board

bas power to borrow from the Treasury 20
times the amount of its capital stock for the
purpose of making loans to farmers in the
various provinces. In other words, the board
now has the right to borrow $80 million and
to lend the same amount.
Present commitments will exhaust practically all the money on hand not later than October 15 next. Therefore, this bill proposes to
increase the board's capital stock to $6 million.
Under the act the board will then be able to
borrow 20 times $6 million, or $120 millionnot all new money, because it bas already
borrowed $80 million, but it will have $40
million more with which to make loans to
farmers in the different provinces.
That briefly, covers the principle involved
in this bill, but perhaps it might be interesting to honourable senators if I were to say
a few words with regard to the whole matter
of operations under the Act.
The Canadian Farm Loan Act was passed
in 1927 as a result of reports made by Dr.
H. M. Tory. Dr. Tory, it will be remembered,
was the founder of the University of Alberta,
and later he became the president of the
National Research Council of Canada. He was
very much interested in farm credits and
made a detailed study of them. In the course
of this undertaking he even travelled to
countries in Europe, to Australia, to New
Zealand, to South Africa, to the United States
of America and to other countries.
In January 1929 the Canadian Farm Loan
Board was set up, and it proceeded to make
loans in provinces which also passed enabling
legislation, namely, Manitoba, Alberta, British
Columbia, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick and
Quebec. The federal Government provided
the capital and guaranteed the public borrowings of the board.
That set-up pertained until 1935, at which
time the board was made an agency of the
Crown, with the Government of Canada the
only shareholder. After 1935 loans were made
by the board to all the provinces, not only
those that had obtained loans under the first
Canadian Farm Loan Board set-up.
Prior to the passing of the Canadian Farm
Loan Act mortgage interest rates in eastern
Canada were quite high, 7 to 8 per cent; and
in western Canada they were still higher,
8 to 10 per cent; and the terms of the loans
which were made by the different loan companies were short, most of them being for
five years only. That was one of the reasons
why the Canadian Farm Loan Act was passed,
to provide for longer-term loans and much
lower rates of interest.
The board, honourable senators, bas paid
its own way. It charges reasonable rates of

JULY
interest and makes loans for a term of 25 to
30 years in extent. Since 1952 it has paid
corporation income taxes, in the same way as
any other corporate business.
I might say for the information of honourable senators that the lending powers of the
board have been changed from time to time.

The Canadian Farm Loan Board is a corporation, consisting of from three to five members, of which the Minister of Finance must
be one. The Chairman, Mr. Frank L. Chester,
is a very capable man, and he has informed
me by letter that he will be glad to appear
before a Senate committee to give a detailed

a little less than a year ago. In 1956 a
Royal Commission was set up to study farm
credit with relation to long-term credit, intermediate credit, and short-term credit. In
its report the commission decided that intermediate credit and short-term credit were
pretty well taken care of by the existing
institutions, such as banks, under the Farm
Improvement Loan Act, and credit bureaux
and the like, but it was not at all satisfied
with the facilities for long-term credit. Over
the years there has been a great change in
the requirements of long term facilities. As
a matter of fact, in the east one of our difficulties is in not having large enough loans
to make available to the farmer so that he
can provide for his family the facilities which
the ordinary artisan can provide for his
family. Among the twelve recommendations

rates generally have fluctuated substantially upwards, the Canadian Farm Loan Board has been
able to maintain a steady and moderate rate."
The Nova Sceotia Land Settlement Board now
operates similarly to the Canadian Farm Loan
Board. A difference between the two boards is
that the provincial Government pays the administrative expenses of the Nova Sceotia board and this
is undoubtedly a factor which enables the Nova
Scotia Land Settlement Board to charge the same
rate of interest as the Canadian Farm Loan Board,
namely, 5 per cent, yet at the same time include in
its charge the cost of insuring its loans (one-half
per cent) in the event of the death of the borrower.

Honourable senators, I may say that in
my province there is generally an aversion
to mortgaging farms. It may not be so
today, but I can remember that when I was
a boy it was one of the worst reflections
that could be cast upon a farmer or his
family to say that his farm was mortgaged.
The report continues:
There has been some duplication of the activities
of the two boards in the past, especially during the
post-war period when the Nova Scotia Land Settlement Board reduced its interest charges to 31 per
cent while those of the Canadian Farm Loan Board
remained at 42 per cent.

Hon. Mr. Macdonald: May I ask a question? Is the one-half of one per cent for
insurance charged only by the Nova Scotia
Land Settlement Board?
Hon. Mr. Hawkins: That is right.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: It is not charged by
the Canadian Farm Loan Board?
Hon. Mr. Hawkins: No. At the moment I
am dealing with the Nova Scotia Land Settlement Board.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I just wanted to have
it clear in my mind.
Hon. Mr. Hawkins: The report goes on to
say:
This discrepancy led to complaints from established farmers that they were forced to turn to
the Canadian Farm Loan Board while farmers and
also immigrants wishing to purchase or establish
themselves on farms were able to receive assistance
through the Nova Scotia Land Settlement Board
at lower interest.

I might say that the Nova Scotia Land
Settlement Board was set up and organized
for the purpose of settling farmers on landthat is, farmers' sons or people who had
taken some training in farming-or for settling
immigrants, so when the rate of interest
that they had to pay was lower there was
pretty keen competition for the Canadian
Farm Loan Board.
To meet this situation, the Land Settlement Board
developed the practice of acquiring the farm even
of an established farmer if he wished to borrow,
paying cash to him for it, and selling it back to
him over a period of years under an agreement of
sale. Thus the Settlement Board entered the loan
business under the guise of settlement whereupon
complaints were received from the Canadian Farm
Loan Board with the result that, by agreement In

1955, the Nova Sceotia Land Settlement Board withdrew from lending, as such, and restricted its
activities to the financing of settlers.
The withdrawal of the Nova Sceotia Land Settlement Board from mortgage lending to established
farmers under agreement of sale in 1955 was not
accompanied by a reduction in its volume of new
loans as may be seen with reference to Table XV.
Loans expanded from $353,877 for the year ending
March 31, 1955 to $411,013 in 1956 and to $576,011 in
1957. Loans granted by the Canadian Farm Loan
Board during the same years were $93,353, $116,800
and $225,974 respectively. In the latter year, therefore, loans advanced by the Nova Scotia Land
Settlement Board were 21 times as great as those
of the Farm Loan Board.
While there are both crities and supporters of
both boards among farmers of the province, the
definite impression which the Commission obtained
from persons appearing at the hearings was that
the Settlement Board has made more impact on
the agricultural industry in Nova Scotia than has
the Canadian Farm Loan Board. Whether the
Canadian Farm Loan Board has adequately met
the requirements of farmers in Nova Sceotia for
mortgage credit is to some extent a matter of
opinion. Whether the board can, and will, do so
is determined by the limitations imposed by the
Canadian Farm Loan Act and the board's interpretation of the act. The situation that has arisen
in Nova Sceotia points up in some degree a problem
pertaining to the adequacy of the farm credit
system in Canada. It has been recognized that the
Canadian Farm Loan Act of 1927 was "a halfhearted federal venture into the field of long-term
agricultural credit" and that the Canadian Farm
Loan Board has tended to be conservative.

The board's payment of income tax is a
very good indication of that.
The report of the Royal Commission on Agriculture and Rural Life in Saskatchewan stated:
"The Canadian Farm Loan Board, established in
1929 and operating in Saskatchewan since 1935,
represented an improvement over lending agencies
in Saskatchewan and in other provinces. While a
useful contribution is being made, it has been overly
cautious in its lending policy, first mortgage loans
averaging no more than a third of the appraised
value of land and buildings. Farmers most in need
of fixed capital loans have been unable to get
sufficient assistance from this agency."
Whatever the achievements and failures of either
the Canadian Farm Loan Board or the Nova Scotia
Land Settlement Board may be with respect to
satisfying the demands of agricultural producers
in Nova Scotia for long-term mortgage credit, the
commission has not found evidence of inefficiency
on the part of either board, but as might be
expected, has received evidence of the existence
of both duplication of services and gaps in the
credit system at the same time. In view, therefore, of the submissions presented to it and of the
difficulty both of drawing a clear line of distinction
between a loan for settlement purposes and one for
improvement in so far as both pertain to the
utilization of agricultural resources within the
province and of co-ordinating the activities of the
two boards, the commission strongly favours the
establishment of one government agency for the
supplying of farm credit to agricultural producers
in Nova Sceotia and hereby emphatically recommend:
Recommendation No. 1
(a) That the Government of the province of
Nova Sceotia open negotiations with the Government of Canada for the establishment of one board
(apart from VLA) to serve as the sole government
agency for the supplying of long term credit to
farmers in Nova Scotia;

SENATE
(b) That the majority of members of the board be
appointed by the provincial Government;
(c) That funds be supplied to the board by both
the federal and provincial Governments;
(d) That responsibility for losses be pro-rated
between the two Governments.

There are two reasons for these recommendations, I think, and I am not sure which
is the more impressive. First, evidently there
was great doubt in the minds of the commissioners about the capacity of the province
to have enough cash to continue meeting the
demands from the agricultural communities.
Secondly, one of the difficulties and perhaps
one of the most severe criticisms of the
Canadian Farm Loan Board was the fact
that it was located in Ottawa. I note from
what has been said that some further
authority is being given to the local agencies.
But at one time all applications for loans
had to be sent to Ottawa for processing,
and the time that elapsed between the application and the granting of the loan was
liable to be about the actual lifetime of an
ordinary farmer. Many applicants became
discouraged. Thorefore, the commission felt
it would be better to have a local agcncy;
the commission also thought there would be
greater advantage in gctting ample funds
for the needs of the province.
There is also the question of direction.
There have been some outstanding cases
where
loans
were
denied
to farmers,
probably on fairly sound grounds, but certainly not because of the lack of ability on
the part of the applicant to repay his loan.
Correspondence was submitted to the commission which, while perhaps it was not
impertinent, certainly showed that the Canadian Farm Loan Board gave peremptory
replies. These letters were sent to responsible citizens of the community, and in many
cases were passed around to parish priests
and other community leaders to read. This
was a matter of poor public relations on the
part of the board.
The Nova Scotia Government maintains a
Farm Management Department.
Many of
the farms in Nova Scotia have a considerable
woodland area.
It is perhaps a debatable
subject, but the Canadian Farm Loan Board
and the Land Settlement Board are rather
slow in giving credit for values to timberland in their appraisals. Appraisals are made
on an acreage basis, and they allow as much
for an acre of brush as for an acre with
good timber on it.
The commission thought it would be a
good idea to use the two agencies, the Nova
Scotia Farm Management Department and
the Department of Forestry, to assist in the
granting of these loans.
So the board
decided to make another recommendation,

which is the twelfth and last of their recommendations.
With the permission of the
house I shall read the remarks of the commission leading up to their twelfth recommendation. These observations, which have
a bearing on the recommendation, are as
follows:
Taking into consideration both the position of
the fariner in the economic system generally and
the widespread changes occurring in agriculture
necessitating larger investment outlays per farm,
the Commission was impressed with the need, expressed both by those presenting briefs and those
who appeared individually for purposes of discussion, for the provision of consultative and supervisory or management services to complement and
render more effective the farm credit system. The
contention was that such services would be of
assistance both to borrowers and the Government
lending agency or agencies not only at the stage
of estimating the credit requirements of borrowers
at the time of applying for loans but also later,
once the loans have been disbursed, when borrowers
are utilizing the funds and the production plans
are being. or have been, put into operation. Especially would the supervisory service be valuable,
it was argued, if the supplying of credit is made
a more dynamic aspect of government policy than
at present.

Honourable senators, I want it clearly understood that this recommendation did not
originate with the commission, but with witnesses who appeared before it as the hearings
proceeded.
The report continues:
The mode of operation and role of the consultative and supervisory personnel may be outlined
as follows:
First, repreventatives should familiarize themselves
with conditions throughout the province and explore
the possibility of strenethening the agricultural
industry in the different geographical areas through
the mediuim of farm credit by engagine in informal
conversation with farmers individually or in groups
t
abou their financial position and their financial
reouirements. In this manner the consultative and
supervisory personnel not only would keep abreast
of the needs and the thinking of farmers but also
could assist and advise individual farmers in the
early stages of making decisions that ultimately
In other
will lead to the borrowing of funds.
words, the supervisory personnel will be engaged
in (a) the making of an economic appraisal of
the feasibility of expanding the production of
existing lines generally, especially those lines which
would appear to warrant much more emphasis; and
(b) the advising of farmers how best to manage
their farm units or, alternatively, how to alter the
faim units (e.g. through enlargement) to adapt
them more adequately to the recommended product
or products.
In se far as the government agency (or agencies)
granting long-terni loans is (are) concerned, the
ground work laid by the supervisory personnel in
an informal way would undoubtedly have a bearing both on the question of who submits an application for a loan and on the intended use of the
funds. In other words, through consultation, the

supervisory personnel can give effective leadership and direction at an early stage te the matter
of the channelling of funds into those lines of
production offering greatest opportunity. In view
of the close relation of agriculture and forestry to
one another on so many farms in the province,

what is envisaged with regard to the duties of the

JULY 31. 1958
supervisory service is a broadening of the work now
done by the appraisers of the Canadian Farm Loan
Board and the Nova Scotia Land Settlement Board
to effect a blending where none exists at present
with the activities now falling under the Farm
Management Division and Forestry Services of the
Departments of Agriculture and Marketing and of
Lands and Forests respectively.
Second, because loans to individual farmers can
amount to several thousands of dollars, a member
of the supervisory or management personnel should
review each application and submit a report containing an economic appraisal of the plan to the
lending agency, such report to be filed with the
application for reference at any time to be used
as a guide by the board when considering whether
the loan should be granted.
Third, in view of the fact that economic conditions
can change drastically during the currency of a
loan and that borrowers may decide to fundamentally alter their pattern of agricultural production, the farm management service should be
prepared at all times to express an opinion concerning the wisdom of modifying the production
plan on any farm on which a loan has been granted.
Fourth, with the growth in the volume of Government lending to farmers an increasingly important
function of the supervisory personnel will be to
collect and analyse data on the agricultural and
forestry situation and outlook and to make this
information available in summarized form so that
it may serve as a guide (and a warning) to the
government lending agency.
The research that
may be necessary in this regard undoubtedly will
require some direct field work throughout the
province in addition to the collecting of regular
reports of provincial and federal Governments on
the agricultural and forest industries generally.
In any event, it ls anticipated that the information
so collected will enable the government lending
agency to detect at the earliest opportunity any
deep-rooted changes in the agricultural and forestry
situation and outlook that have a bearing upon
government policy respecting the supplying of
credit to farmers. The utilization by the lending
agency of the services of personnel technically
trained in the fields of agriculture and economics,
farm management, and forestry, is essential to the
development of a well-rounded program of farm
credit.
The question arises, however, whether the services
of the consultative and supervisory personel will
be too costly to warrant their inclusion in the farm
credit program. The answer, of course, depends
on how large a staff is to be built up. The more
expensive the service the stronger is the argument
in support of Recommendation No. 1 which advocates the establishment of one board. For the year
ending March 31, 1956, the administrative expenditures in Canada of the Canadian Farm Loan
Board, which do not include provision for supervisory services, were 7.7 per cent of loans disbursed.
During the same period, expenditures of the Nova
Scotia Land Settlement Board were 8 per cent of
loans. The administrative expenditures in Nova
Scotia during the past fiscal year of the Veterans'
Land Administration which, as outlined in this
report, is a complete system within itself and is
well-known both for the training it provides for
its staff and the nature and extent of the supervisory service it offers, were approximately 18 per
cent of loans disbursed.
As mentioned above, since a Farm Management
Division exists in the Department of Agriculture
and Marketing and a Forestry Service in the Department of Lands and Forests, it is the opinion of the
Commission that the services of sufficient supervisory personnel can be made available either to

the lending agency recommended by Recommendation No. 1, or to the Nova Scotia Land Settlement
Board under Recommendation No. 2 at reasonable
cost-

Recommendation No. 2 was that the Nova
Sceotia Land Settlement Board be permitted
to enter the mortgage lending field, which
is wholly taken up now by the Farm Loan
Board. The report continues:
-especially if there is close co-operation between
the lending agency, the Farm Management Division,
and the Forestry Service. The commission emphasizes, however, that economy in the provision of
supervision should not be carried too far as it is
conceivable that in any year the supervisory personnel together with the agricultural representatives and the members of the forestry service not
only might prevent the loss of a considerable sum
of money as a result of the granting of questionable
loans but also, more importantly, might influence
the course of the utilization of agricultural and
forest resources on farms in such a way that the
incomes of farmers would be increased by several
thousands of dollars.
Therefore, in view of the arguments in favour
of making provision for the inclusion of a consultative and supervisory service in the Farm
Credit Program, the need for greater integration
of forestry and farming on many farm holdings in
Nova Scotia, and the existence of farm management and forestry services within the province, the
commission hereby recommends:
Recommendation No. 12
(a) That in order to provide the consultative and
guidance or supervisory services to agricultural
borrowers both at the time of negotiating for loans
and later during the course of repayment, steps be
taken to relate the work of the Farm Management
Division and of the Forestry Services of the Departments of Agriculture and Marketing and of
Lands and Forests respectively to the work of
whatever lending agency or agencies are retained
or established in relation to Recommendation No. 1
and No. 2;
(b) That when each application for a loan is
received by the lending agency a member of the
supervisory personnel submit an appraisal of the
economic possibilities of the plan proposed by the
prospective borrower;
(c) That such report be filed with the application
for reference purposes and be used as a guide by
the lending agency when considering the granting
of the loan; and
(d) That in addition to collecting and recording
specific and technical information respecting the
individual farm units and operators, the lending
agency collect and evaluate general information
regarding the agricultural and forestry situation
and outlook for the purpose of detecting general
changes in economic conditions that will impinge
upon the agricultural industry of the province and
will have a bearing, therefore, on the policy and
program of supplying credit to farmers.

As I have said, I was disappointed that
there was no mention of these recommendations in this proposed amendment to the act.
I understood that negotiations were opened
between the Government of Nova Scotia and
the Government of Canada with this end in
view, but I have no further knowledge of
it. I noticed that in the committee proceedings of the other place there were representations on the part of some Nova Scotia members to the minister that Recommendation

SENATE
No. 1 of the Commission be implemented, but
I have no knowledge of his reply. I hope that
before long an amendment will be submitted
in this connection, and I will have pleasure
in seeing this recommendation implemented.
Hon. John T. Haig: Honourable senators, I
will keep the house only a few minutes. I
wish to congratulate the Canadian Farm
Loan Board upon having appointed a capable
person as manager of its branch office at Winnipeg. You sometimes wonder whether a
person in a job like that will be moved out
fast if he happens to be on the wrong side
of the fence, politically speaking. I don't
know about this man, but as we have no
Liberals or C.C.F.'ers in Manitoba perhaps he
is a Conservative. On the other hand, his
uncle was a strong Liberal. I know this because we attended the same university and
we used to have some great old talks. In any
event, the manager of the Winnipeg office is
very efficient and is giving extremely good
service. This means a lot to an organization
such as the Farm Loan Board.
Modern farm machinery enables farmers,
particularly those of the three Prairie provinces, to operate a section of land almost
as economically as they used to operate a
half-section. Sometimes farmers have wanted
to buy property adjacent to their own but
in the past they have found it financially
difficult to do so. The new manager of the
Winnipeg office has gone out of his way to
facilitate this sort of transaction. I want to
refer to the case of a farmer who owned
a section of land, three-quarters of which was
in one location and the other quarter about
four miles away. He wanted to sell the
quarter-section and buy some land adjacent
to his larger piece of property. He needed
$11,000 cash and was able to put up $5,500
himself, and the board loaned him $5,500 on
his quarter-section. He then bought the
property he wanted and sold the quartersection that was located four miles away.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Could he not have
the money from a private
borrowed
institution?
Hon. Mr. Haig: No, because private institutions are not willing to lend money at 5
per cent interest. They want 6 per cent, 7
per cent or even 7A per cent. In any event,
they are not keen on lending money on farm
property now. Here is the point I want to
make. It takes a provincial organization to
handle collections on farm loans, just as it
takes a municipal organization to handle
collections on municipal property. A company dealing in municipal loans does not
want to deal in farm loans because, generally
speaking, its personnel are not trained for

the purpose. That is why the Canadian Farm
Loan Board is gradually taking over the
handling of all farm loans in Manitoba. In
the farm loans that I have seen go through
our law office in the last 15 years, the value
of the land being sold has never been mortgaged to a greater extent than 50 per cent.
That is a pretty safe criterion. The board
charges 5 per cent interest and, as I have
indicated, it has facilitated farmers in selling land they don't want and acquiring new
land. The young manager of the office in
Winnipeg is extremely well liked by the
businessmen of Manitoba, and he has rendered the farming community a great service.
Incidentally, I call him a young man; he is
actually 45, but that is young to me.
The honourable Leader of the Government
(Hon. Mr. Aseltine) has given us a clear explanation of the bill. I am not familiar with
the situation in Nova Scotia, but the bonourable gentleman from Milford-Hants (Hon.
Mr. Hawkins) is, and his suggestions may be
all to the good.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Could the honourable
senator tell us whether there is a provincial
board in Manitoba that lends money?
Hon. Mr. Haig: What happens is this. A
farmer applies for a loan and the branch
manager will send an inspector out to make
an investigation. There are three such inspectors for the province of Manitoba. The
inspector furnishes the branch office with certain information and, on instructions from
the branch office, he negotiates a loan for the
farmer. The board would not loan $5,500 on a
quarter-section if it was four miles from the
person who wanted to buy it, but in the case
I illustrated the board was quite safe in loaning the money on the quarter-section because it was adjacent to property of the
intended purchaser.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: Did the board make the
loan on the whole section?
Hon. Mr. Haig: No, just the quarter-section.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: You can't get that sort
of a loan through very often.
Hon. Mr. Haig: That's because you haven't
got good land like we have in Manitoba.
Anyway, this type of activity has brought
the board into high respect in Manitoba. The
tendency has been for insurance companies
and trust companies and other lending institutions to lend money on city property rather
than on rural or farm property. This is
because they are more familiar with city
property. You can't blame them for their
attitude. However, the manager of the Manitoba branch of the Canadian Farm Loan

JULY 31, 1958
Board has done a great deal to help farmers
get loans, and for this reason he has been
a great credit to the board.
I am glad to see that the lending power
of the board is being extended. The old
system that sometimes required a farmer to
give a chattel mortgage was an abomination
because it made him appear to be in financial
trouble. The new basis under which the board
has functioned has been satisfactory, and
speaking for the farmers of Manitoba I want
to say I am highly in favour of this legislation.
Hon. Austin C. Taylor (Westmorland): Honourable senators, it is not my purpose to
delay the bill at all. There is not much
I can add to what has already been said
but I would like to make one or two observations and perhaps offer a few recommendations. I want to thank the honourable
Leader of the Government (Hon. Mr. Aseltine) for the full explanation he gave of the
bill and for the history of the board's operations. I also want to congratulate the honourable gentleman from Milford-Hants (Hon.
Mr. Hawkins) upon his clear explanation of
the situation in Nova Scotia. I can assure
you that no member of this house knows
more about farm loan activities than our honourable colleague. In his modesty be neglected to say that he was chairman of the
Royal Commission on Rural Credit that was
set up in Nova Scotia. That commission did
an excellent job.
A question was asked by the honourable
Leader of the Opposition (Hon. Mr. Macdonald) about branch offices of the board.
I believe there is a branch office in each
province, with a manager and staff. If memory serves me correctly, I believe local advisory committees are set up throughout the
various areas of the provinces. I know that
is the case in my own province.
Honourable senators, I am in full accord
with the amendment before us but I regret
that the Canadian Farm Loan Act is not being
amended in one or two more places at this
time. I feel that the act should be revised and
brought up to date to meet the present-day
needs of our farm population. In my opinion
the act falls quite short of doing that. For
instance, I believe that in 1956 the amount
that any one farmer could borrow from the
board was increased from $5,000 to $15,000.
This applies to individuals, but a partnership
of two or more cannot secure a loan above
that amount; that is the maximum for an
individual or for a partnership of two or more
people. In many cases a farmer with one or
two sons operates a farm and under the act
they are not permitted to secure a larger
loan than a man who is farming by himself.

Another matter that was raised by the bonourable senator from Milford-Hants deserves
attention. I should like to emphasize that
under the present regulations the valuation
placed on a property is based on the cultivated
farm lands together with the buildings. In
all the eastern provinces, particularly Nova
Scotia and New Brunswick, one of the greatest
assets to a farmer is his woodlot, whether it
contains logs, pulpwood or hardwood, but no
consideration has been given to that in the
appraisal in relation to loans.
Honourable senators, I should like to make
one or two recommendations, in view of the
fact that in our province of New Brunswick
we have what we call the Farm Settlement
Act, similar to what in Nova Scotia is called
the Land Settlement Act. The purpose of the
board set up under the act is to purchase
farms for prospective farmers, and in practice
this applies to farmers' sons, although it may
apply to any men up to 45 years of age. In
my experience, and I spent some seventeen
years in administering the Farm Settlement
Act in New Brunswick, the great bulk of the
applications were from farmers' sons, in cases
where there were perhaps two, three or more
sons on the farm, one of whom usually remained with the father while the others
would be on their own. The board would be
given permission to buy such a farm and
re-sell it to the applicant over a term of years
under an agreement of sale, the farm remaining the property of the board until the final
payment was made. I was under the impression, and I think it was confirmed by the
honourable Leader of the Government (Hon.
Mr. Aseltine), that no authority was granted
to the Canadian Farm Loan Board to buy a
farm for an individual regardless of the
length of his experience or how highly
qualified be might be. The act applies to
those men who are already farmers, or who
own a farm for the purpose of securing more
land, buildings or machinery, et cetera. It
seems, therefore, that probably there is not
a complete service provided, and that there
is an overlapping as well.
I suggest to the Leader of the Government
-and he can relay to the Government some
of the things that I believe many of us feel
should be done-that the Canadian Farm
Loan Act be consolidated with the Farm Improvement Loans Act, and be incorporated
together with the terms and conditions of
operations of the provincial boards that are
in existence. In other words, it seems to me
that instead of there being two organizations lending money, one organization could
do the lending, as was suggested by my
honourable colleague from Milford-Hants.
I also suggest that the funds be raised by
the federal Government, because in my

SENATE
opinion they can be secured in that way at
lower rates of interest, at least up to this
point.
I also suggest, and I am not going into
detail, that the provinces separately-because
each province has its separate problemsenter into an agreement with the dominion
Government, and that members of the federal authority and members of the provincial
authority be appointed to make up the provincial board, and that there be advisory
officers in connection with the organization.
I suggest a threefold purpose of the board.
First, it should provide long-terrn loans for
the purpose of securing farm properties or
land, or additional land. I think that is paramount at this time. Most of us will agree
that there is an acute shortage of farm help,
and it is not the disposition of young men
to work or stay on farms. Also, because of
mechanization of the farrm we must have
larger units to operate, and to secure sufficient machinery to operate successfully and
efficiently requires a considerable amount of
money. I do not feel that a maximum loan
of $15,000 is sufficiently large; I think it
should be raised to at least $20,000.
Secondly, I suggest that if there is a partnership of two or more there should be
some arrangement, perhaps on a sliding scale,
whereby the partnership could secure a
larger loan than an individual could secure.
And thirdly, I suggest that in the operation of this board the moneys be loaned to
the farmers at cost to the Government. The
federal Government could raise the money
at a lower rate of interest. My experience is
that not many farms in the country today
can pay 5 per cent on the total investment,
after paying taxes, insurance, and other expenses. As a matter of fact, some years ago
in my province we reduced the interest rate
on loans, under the Farm Settlement Board,
from 5 per cent to 3 per cent, to bring it
more in line with the earning capacity of
the farm, and the rate still stands at 3 per
cent. I am not suggesting that that should
be the figure, but that the rate of interest
charged the farmers under this plan be not
more than the borrowing rate of the federal
Government; but in order that there may be
some responsibility on the part of the provincial authorities for any losses accruing and
for administration expenses, 50 per cent
should be paid by the province and 50 per
cent by the federal Government.
Honourable senators, those are some of
my recommendations. I will not go into the
matter further at this time, because no doubt
there will be an opportunity before long to
study the details. I feel that the Government
recognizes there must be some revision of the

whole borrowing and credit system, and I
hope the Leader of the Government will
bring to the Government's attention the needs
of farmers in respect to credit loans.
It is true, as my honourable colleague from
Winnipeg (Hon. Mr. Haig) said a few moments
ago, that in years gone by there were mortgage
companies which were quite willing to loan
money on farm properties, because that was
all they could loan money on, but the time
has corne when those companies are not interested in farrn properties as security for
loans. I am suggesting that there should be
long-term loans-first for the purpose of
purchasing farms or farm lands and secondly,
for the purpose of farm improvement, such
as drainage, buildings and machinery.
I
think that shorter-term loans also are
required, but at the present time shorterterm loans have been taken care of in part
and will continue to be taken care of in
many areas by local credit unions and various
organizations of that kind.
Honourable senators, I do not want to say
any more at this time. I support the amendment now before us. I am disappointed that
it does not go farther and I hope the Government will give consideration to the revision
and remodelling of the whole credit system
in relation to the farm needs of our country.
Hon. John J. MacDonald: Honourable senators, having been an appraiser under the
Farm Loan Board back in 1935 I feel that
probably I could illustrate to you some of the
difficulties that were met with at that time
by farmers applying for loans. That was the
year when a real honest-to-goodness effort
was made to improve the farm loan business.
I am very glad that the honourable senator
from Churchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar) bas just
corne back into the chamber, because I know
that he was a member of the House of Commons when the Bennett Government revamped farm loan legislation. At that time I
was selected as an appraiser under the Farm
Loan Board.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: May I correct my honourable friend, if he will permit me? I was
not in Parliament from 1930 to 1935.
Hon. Mr. MacDonald: I'm sorry, I thought
you were. I thought you were in Parliament
from 1915 onward.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: No. I was a candidate
in the election of 1930 but I retired from
public life, temporarily, with the full consent
of my constituents.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: And came back with
their full consent.
Hon. Mr. MacDonald: I may say that I was
very well acquainted with what went on with

JULY
the Farm Loan Board, around 1935, and I
just want to describe some of the things
that happened then. Let us suppose that a
farmer had a mortgage debt and also what
is known as unsecured liabilities, and that
his total debt, both mortgage and unsecured,
amounted to $4,000. Well, if he made application for a loan I had to draw a plan of
his farm, to note the size of his buildings
and even to observe what sort of a wife he
had, whether she appeared to me to be an
aggressive person or sort of slack, because all
that helped, mind you, to determine whether
he would be competent in the future to
repay the loan. All these factors had to be
taken into consideration. If I felt that man
would be able to repay the loan, but that
his property and so forth was not worth $4,000,
I probably could recommend him for a $3,500
loan. What then did we do? I would advise
him of what was decided. Now, in 1934
Farmers' Creditors Arrangement Act was set
up and that farmer would have to go before
the Farmers' Creditors Arrangement Board
and make application. He could get a farm
loan of $3,500, but remember he owed $4,000.
And what was he going to do about that?
Well, his creditors were called in and they
probably nipped off a bit here and there and
got his debt down to $3,500.
Hon. Mr. Haig: They sure did.
Hon. Mr. MacDonald: That's the point. But
I believe that the Farmers' Creditors Arrangement Act was the salvation of a great many
people in eastern Canada, through enabling
them to stay on the farm. I only hope that
if this bill goes before a committee I will
have the privilege of attending and finding
out some information on how this farm loan
business is working today. Let us take care
that the day will not come when that same
sort of Creditors Arrangement Act will have
to be brought to life again.
I am not going to say much more. I just
wanted to give you a picture of the set-up
as it was back in the year 1935. What bas
happened since then I do not know, but I
am going to make it a point to find out.
Hon. F. W. Gershaw: Honourable senators,
I heard someone saying something about delays in getting loans from the Canadian Farm
Loan Board. In the part of the province
from which I come, not only are. there long
delays before a loan is processed but the
answer at the end is always "No", and that
for two reasons: one, that some of the applicants are located on irrigated land and
possibly not enough information has been
gathered yet for the board to properly judge
their worth; and secondly, that the rest of
57075-4-29

the applicants are located in a dry area, and
when they apply for a loan they are told
something to the effect that loans are not
being made on farms in that part of the
country, where crop failures occur so often.
I hope that as time goes on those defects
will be overcome and that the board will
perhaps be better informed and a little more
generous so that farmers from all parts may
benefit by these farm loans.
Hon. William M. Wall: Honourable senators, I cannot resist the temptation to comment upon this bill, both upon what is in it
and also on what is missing. Like other
senators, I welcome the legislation because
it meets an apparent and documented need
for more financial funds with which to give
help to farmers, and I wish to express my
intention to support this amendment.
The bill was presented to us as a simple,
clear piece of legislation which was urgent
-urgent because unless it was passed lending would have to stop, as present funds
would be exhausted by October 15 and, as
I understand it, there bas been an accelerated demand for loans within the present
statutory limits and regulations. I notice
that in June of this year loans were 70 per
cent higher than they were in June of last
year. For example, in the first six months
of 1958 there were 106 per cent more loans
than in the first six months of 1957, so that
there is some urgency to this legislation. We
support this amendment, which is akin to
the amendment made back in 1957 when the
Canadian Farm Loan Board's capital stock
was increased from 30,000 shares to 40,000
shares.
I for one hope that the bill will be referred
to committee, because it appears that important changes in methods and procedure have
been made since the last amendment to the
act, and that there is a change of tone and
attitude in the way the board has been
handling this work since 1956. I think that
it probably would be interesting for honourable senators to have more specifics about
these changes.
I must align myself with honourable senators who have spoken before me-the
honourable senator from Milford-Hants (Hon.
Mr. Hawkins) and the honourable senator
from Westmorland (Hon. Mr. Taylor)-in
expressing my disappointment that the bill
is so brief and its contents so far removed
from the comprehensive changes in farm
credit statutes which I was led to expect.
Merely to increase the board's capitalization
by $2 million and therefore its borrowing
power by $40 million, and its lending power
by $40 million or more if a part of the capital is also used for mortgages, is all very
fine. But that is all.

SENATE

Nothing is said about changing the ground
rules or the yardsticks so that improvements
may be made in meeting under this act the
demand for the kind of farm credit which
the present Government spokesmen when in
opposition said was needed and should have
been provided for when the act was amended
in 1956. Hence, I wish to bring these observations to your attention in order that this
bill may be put into its proper context and
perspective. It is to these omissions that I
wish to address a few remarks, to the things
that I thought I would see in the bill.
I submit, honourable senators, that this
bill falls far short of the expressed conviction of the present spokesman of the Government and of the election promises to
which I listened.
I must admit, however, that the honourable minister who introduced this bill in the
other house admitted to the temporary nature
of the changes. At page 2297 of the House
of Commons Hansard the minister is reported
as follows:
At the present time the Government is engaged
in a comprehensive study and review of all three
acts

-that is the Canadian Farm Loan Act, the
Farm Improvement Loans Act and the
Veterans' Land Actwith a view to determining where enlargement
of scope,

I would stress those words:
expansion in function or improvement
methods of operation may be required.

in the

The minister goes on to say:
That study is continuing and will continue for
some time.

1, for one, favour integration of the three
farm credit acts into one comprehensive,
modern farm loan policy. May I add to the
observations of the honourable senator from
Westmorland my hope that the jurisdiction
under which this comprehensive modern farm
loan policy will operate will be in the
hands of the Department of Agriculture.
Let me refer to the promise of the honourable Minister of Finance, that a study is
continuing and will continue for some time.
This promise is basically lame, and I contend
it does not absolve the Government from
making now, at this session, necessary and
sequential changes which its spokesmen
were convinced could and should have been
made in the act back in 1956.
How long is this promised study to take?
Let us assume it will take one year; maybe
it will take two years. By the time the
changes come into the statute two years may
have elapsed. Why should not farmers who
need a specific type of credit benefit now?
I wish to document some of this background. Rising to speak after the motion for

the second reading of the amendments in
1956, the spokesman for the then Opposition said that those amendments-which were
substantial amendments to the operational
aspects of the act, and which did enlarge
its scope a great deal-marked a move in
the right direction but that the changes did
not go far enough to meet the special capital
needs of our agricultural economy. Then the
speaker documented some of the needs as
seen by the then Opposition. He stressed the
need for a relatively higher percentage of
capitalization and for long-term loans at low
interest rates; also, he pointed to the special
need for short-term farm credit. He pointed
to the special needs of farmers now operating on uneconomie farm units and especially
he stressed the needs of the young farmers
who were beginning to farm. Mention was
also made of supervisory services. This
speaker then pointed out, for example, that it
took $35,000 in capital to buy an economical
farm unit, and he documented the specific
items of $13,500 for land, $8,900 for the
buildings and so on, until he got a figure of
$35,000. Then he queried how the new 1956
maximum, which was then set at $15,000,
could meet this need of buying an economical
farm unit at $35,000. Today I have to repeat
this same query: how can the present limitation of $15,000 meet this need? And I ask
why the present bill is so overly short and
why it does not contain amendments which
vould change these operative ground rules
of the board: for example, by increasing the
size of the maximum loans.
I want to point out too that, as reported
on page 3640 of the Commons Hansard of
1956, an Opposition spokesman, the present
Honourable Mr. Macdonnell, moved an amendment as follows:
That clause 6, subparagraph (ii) be amended by
striking out the word "fifteen" and replacing it
by the word "twenty".

This amendment was moved after the bill
had been considered in a standing committee and was on third reading. So I am
disappointed that there is not an additional
item in this bill saying something about
changing the maximum from the $15,000 to
the $20,000 which was then regarded as a
very important and necessary amendment to
the bill.
I regret that the honourable senator from
Hastings-Frontenac (Hon. Mr. White) is not
present in the chamber, for hie spoke in the
other house suggesting that the percentage of
the loan vis-à-vis the assessed value could
and should be increased to 75 per cent. Why
do we not have now a section in the present
bill changing this percentage of the maximum
from 65 per cent, which was then regarded
as inadequate, to 75 per cent, which was then

JULY 31, 1959
regarded as adequate? I was hoping that I
would see a section in the bill amending
section 6 (1) of the act so as to change the
percentage from. 65 per cent to 75 per cent.
Before closing, I should like to point out
that interesting commitmnents were made not
very long ago by the spokesmen of the
present Government concerning long-termi
farmi credit. On March il of this year the
Prime Mînister is quoted in the Hamilton
Spectator as having said:
Long-term credit will be extended ta help farmers
plan for the future.

At the famous Mont Tremblant Conference
the Minister of Agriculture was quoted, on
September 18, 1957, as follows:
A more generous farm credit pollcy and the
diversification of production may limprove Canada's
depressed farm economy, Agriculture Minister Harkness said today. He suggested the type of credit
poicy smiiar to loans accorded under the Veterans'
Land Act may be used ta help farmers.

problem area of farm credit? Is it too late to
suggest that perhaps somehow, by some magic,
additional amendmnents might yet be made by
the Government even at this late date?
Honourable senators will know from reading press reports that there have been statements made running something like this:
Why didn't they do it, when? I must admit
that I amn mischievous enough this afternoon
ta ask: Why doesn't the Government do it
now, when the same need exists, when new
visions of opportunity beckon, when new concepts of responsibility so ordain? I feel that
the Government is secure in its political convictions of needed changes, secure in the
knowledge that the members of this bouse
will not; oppose sensible changes in legislation
dealing with extension of farmn credit, and I
arn sure that the Government is secure in the
overwhelming mai ority that it has in the other
house.
Motion agreed to and bill read second time.

the Veterans' Land Act they will see that

PRIVATE BILL
WESTCOAST TRANSMISSION COMPANY LIMITED
-FIRST READING

Hon. William R. Bruni presented Bill S-16,
respecting Westcoast Transmission Company
Limited.
He said: Honourable senators, the bill is a
very simple one. The company desires the
right to change the number of persons who
shall compose the board of directors, and
they desire to have the further right to set
up an executive committee which will be
composed of part of the directorate of the
company. On second reading I can give a full
explanation.
Bill read first time.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, when shall this bill be read the second
time?
Hon. Mr. Bruni: Thursday next.
DIVORCE
REPORTS

OF COMMITTEE

ADOPTED

Hon. Arthur W. Roebuck, Chairman of the
Standing Committee on Divorce, presented
the committee's reports Nos. 281 to 293.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, when shall these reports be taken into
consideration?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Honourable senators,
it has been the practice for a number of
years, as we approach the close of the session,
ta expedite passage of Divorce Committee
reports in order that the bills resulting therefrom may be sent as soon as possible to the
House of Commons for consideration, and
so that as few as possible may die on the

Order Paper. I think that stage of the
present session has now been reached; and
therefore, on behalf of the Divorce Committee, I would ask that these reports be
considered now.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Agreed.
Hon. Senators: Agreed.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I think the honourable gentleman is rather optimistic in thinking we are near the close of the session.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: I may be.
I now move, with leave, that these reports
be adopted.
Motion agreed to.
DESTRUCTION OF DOCUMENTS
NOTICE OF INQUIRY

Hon. Jean-François Pouliot: Honourable
senators, I beg leave to give the following
notice of inquiry:
(1) Referring to Appendix

"B" of the Senate

Hansard of June 24 ult., who were the representatives named by the Ministers of National Defence,
the Ministers of Labour, the Ministers of Public
Works, the Ministers of Trade and Commerce, the
Secretaries of State for External Affairs, the Ministers of Finance and the Canadian Historical
Association?
(2) How much was paid to each one?
(3) Did the following departments: the Prime
Minister's Office, Veterans Affairs, Transport, the
Solicitor General of Canada, Justice, National
Revenue, Agriculture, Citizenship and Immigration,
Fisheries, P ost Office, Mines and Technical Surveys,
National Health and Welfare, Northern Affairs and
National Resources, and Defence Production have
any representatives on the Public Records Committee since 1945?
(4) If so, who were they? If not, who were the
acting representatives for the said departments?
(5) Since September 20, 1945, what quantity of
official documents from each department has been
incinerated or sold to the junk man?

I could ask a sixth question, as follows:
How many sheets of paper would there be in
a cubic foot of stationery?

The reason why I ask that question is that
in the answer that was given on June 24 in
reply to my inquiry regarding the destruction
of documents there was a statement of the
number of cubic feet of paper destroyed.
CENTRAL MORTGAGE BANK
NOTICE OF INQUIRY

Hon. Mr. Pouliot: I have a second notice of
inquiry, as follows:
(1) After the Central Mortgage Bank Bill had
passed all stages at the session of 1939, were the
Central Mortgage Bank directors named and, if so,
on what date?
(2) Did the said act go into effect, and if not,
why?

My information, which is not definite, is
that directors were appointed but they could
not take up their duties because the act was
not put into effect.

AUGUST 5. 1958
BUSINESS OF THE SENATE
Hon. W. Ross Macdonald: Honourable senators, I noticed in the press the other day a
dispatch to the effect that the Minister of
Justice intends to call a meeting with provincial representatives to discuss the Fauteux
Committee report. I also noticed on the
Orders of the Day of the other house that the
Minister of Justice has a resolution which
reads in part as follows:
Resolved, that it is expedient to introduce a
measure to establish a board to be known as the

National Parole Board-

Honourable senators, the reason I am asking
this question is that I know there are quite
a number of members of this house who are
very much interested in that resolution and
have been giving careful consideration to the
Fauteux Committee report, with a view to
discussing the bill for the setting up of the
National Parole Board, when that bill comes
to the Senate. Could the Leader of the
Government (Hon. Mr. Aseltine) inform this
house whether it is the intention of the
Minister of Justice to proceed with the resolution that I have mentioned?
Also, in view of the optimistic statement
by the honourable senator from TorontoTrinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck) as to the approaching end of the session, could the Leader
of the Government give us some idea as to
what further legislation we can expect before
prorogation?
Hon. W. M. Aseltine: Honourable senators,
the matter which has just been brought to
the attention of the house by the Leader of
the Opposition (Hon. Mr. Macdonald) is Order
No. 17 on the Routine Proceedings and
Orders of the Day in the other house. My
honourable friend told me he was going to ask
this question, so I am not surprised, but
it was rather late in the day when he brought
the matter up and I have not yet been able
to get the answer.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Some notice is better
than no notice at all.

South Saskatchewan Dam, a bill to provide
for the construction of a bridge in New Brunswick-I think at Campobello and connecting
with Maine-a bill to amend the Customs Act,
a bill to amend the Citizenship Act, and a bill
respecting supply for 1957-58. So between
now and prorogation 22 bills will probably
come to this house for our consideration. I
had expected that we would have certain
legislation from the other house by this evening, namely, a bill to amend the excise tax,
a bill with respect to the taxation of estates,
a bill to amend the Customs Act, and a bill to
amend the Income Tax Act, but very little
progress has been made in the other house
on these bills and it may be a day or two
before we receive them. However, on Wednesday or Thursday we shall have an interim
supply bill. That, honourable senators, is all
of the information I have at the present time.
Hon. Mr. Pouliot: Merry Christmas!
Hon. Mr. Crerar: In view of the program
of legislation which the honourable leader has
outlined, may I ask if he can give the house
any idea when prorogation may come?
Hon. Mr. Aselline: I am betting on the 23rd
day of August.
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: We would have to get
the consent of the Senate to win that bet.
Hon. Mr. Euler: What sort of odds, Mr.
Leader?
Hon. William M. Wall: Honourable senators,
I wonder if I may ask the Government
Leader a question arising out of what he has
said about legislation still to come before the
house, and which confirms press reports that
it is the intention of the Government to bring
forward legislation concerning a bill of rights.
I have read some of the debates about the
Bill of Rights, and I noticed in the Commons
Hansardfor 1955, at page 903, that the present
Prime Minister asked at that time what
serious objection there could be to the setting
up each year of a joint committee of the
House of Commons and the Senate to act as
a kind of watchdog over civil and human
rights. Can the Leader of the Government
(Hon. Mr. Aseltine) tell us whether it is the
intention of the Government now to set up
a joint committee before proceeding with
the introduction of the Bill of Rights, which
is reported to be drafted and ready?
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: I have no information
whatsoever other than what I have given to
the house.

Hon. Mr. Aseltine: I may be able to have
the answer tomorrow.
With regard to the question as to what
legislation we can expect to receive in this
house between now and prorogation, I might
say that besides Order No. 17, which has just
been referred to, there are fourteen pieces
of legislation mentioned in the Orders of
the Day and which I understand it was
stated yesterday are expected to be proceeded
with. In addition to those fifteen measures,

Hon. Jean-François Pouliot: Honourable
senators, before this motion is put I would
like to draw attention to a matter of considerable importance. All of you must have
realized that the evidence in the various
cases before the Divorce Committee piles up
much higher than our sessional papers, than
the Hansard of the Senate, and the Minutes
of the Senate, and the reports of the other
committees of the Senate. It would be
interesting to know how much time our
Hansard staff spends in taking the evidence
in shorthand and transcribing it. They
must spend five times as much time in doing
that work as in reporting debates and other
committees. The conclusion is obvious: it
is that at times when very important committees are sitting we cannot have a stenographic report made because the reporters
are held at the Divorce Committee taking
notes in the various cases. It is unfortunate
that the work of the Senate suffers owing
to the number of divorce cases that are
brought before the Senate committee.
We have an experienced Hansard staff;
they work nearly day and night to do the
work of the Divorce Committee. We have
their services here in the chamber for our
debates, but we cannot have them in our
other committees. This is something everybody knows. I wonder if it would not be easier
if the members of the Divorce Committee
took a few notes of the evidence given before
them. For instance, if the evidence was that
the sheets were up to the neck or shoulders,
the note need only show "ditto"; if the
clothes are on the chair, another "ditto". In
this way a lot of time would be saved, we
would have the valuable assistance of the
Senate reporters at our other committees,
and as a result the country would benefit.
Some days ago I said that I would think
hard to offer a suggestion on this subject.
Honourable senators, this is one suggestion.
Nobody would suffer if the honourable
gentlemen who sit on the Divorce Committee
would make a note that they are satisfied
with the evidence; they could say "ditto" for
their decisions too. It does not take long to
write "ditto". It would be a time- and
money-saving experiment, and I submit it
in all good faith, with the hope that it will
be taken into consideration if another more
constructive way cannot be found.
Hon. W. M. Aselline: Honourable senators,
may I say that the honourable senator from
De la Durantaye (Hon. Mr. Pouliot) is absolutely incorrect in what he has said. If

SENATE

he implies by his remarks that on certain
occasions we have not been able to get the
services of our reporting staff to record the
proceedings of any committee, let me say
that in all the years I have been in the
Senate I have never known of an instance
when the proceedings of a committee were
not reported if we wanted them to be reported. We have a staff, they are ready to
work, and we can have them whenever we
want them.
Hon. W. D. Euler: Honourable senators, I
would like to suggest that our friend from
De la Durantaye (Hon. Mr. Pouliot) support
a resolution to relieve this house of the
necessity of dealing with divorce cases entirely by establishing divorce courts in those
provinces that do not have them now and
whose citizens have to petition for divorce
to the Senate of Canada.
Hon. F. W. Gershaw: Honourable senators,
may I say a word on this subject?
It has been suggested that there is considerable expense involved in the reporting
of the work of the Divorce Committee. That
may be true, but it should be pointed out
that the petitioner in each case pays a basic
fee of $210. Occasionally in the case of a
petitioner who is in poor circumstances-for
instance, a servant girl-the amount of the
fee is reduced to perhaps $50; on one or two
occasions I have known the entire fee to
be remitted. A calculation of the cost of
handling these cases indicates that the
printing, translating and stenographic work
amounts to about $125. I am advised that if
a petitioner withdraws his petition, he still
pays $25 to cover the cost of printing and
translation. It is apparent that the work of
the Divorce Committee does not result in
any monetary loss to the Treasury; on the
contrary, the Consolidated Revenue Fund
receives revenue from this source.
However, honourable senators, this does
not detract from the unfortunate fact that
these cases have to be dealt with here.
Every case is a domestic tragedy, and the
members of the committee are most particular to inquire whether there is any hope
of a reconciliation between the parties or
a chance of saving the marriage; the committee also inquires about the arrangements
being made for the maintenance and education of the children.
The honourable senator from De la Durantaye (Hon. Mr. Pouliot) has suggested a procedure by which if the members of the
Divorce Committee were satisfied with a case
they would pass it and that should be the
end of the matter. It is hardly as simple as
that. The reports of the committee in each
case come before this chamber and are sent

to the other chamber where, on some occasions, there has been a good deal of comment
and criticism. Because of this, the honourable
chairman of the committee (Hon. Mr.
Roebuck) has briefed us all on the necessity
of having, before a case is recommended,
strong and convincing evidence and such as
will satisfy the committee in the other house
and the members generally.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: May I add a word? I
am glad that others beside myself have
spoken on this question. But with regard to
interference by the Divorce Committee with
the operation of other committees, may I
point out that as a rule the other committees
meet on Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays, whereas the Divorce Committee holds
its regular meetings on Mondays and Fridays.
This arrangement is rather important in two
respects. For one thing, members of the
Divorce Committee are hearing cases on days
-Mondays
and Fridays-when quite frequently-not always, but sometimes-other
honourable senators are elsewhere, perhaps
at home.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Only those from Ontario
and Quebec.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: That is true, and I
suggest that is why the majority of the members of the Divorce Committee are from
provinces other than Ontario and Quebec.
I happen to come from Ontario, and quite
frequently could spend some time at home
were I not engaged on the Divorce Committee
on Mondays and Fridays.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I believe other honourable senators from Ontario are in the same
position.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Yes, that is so.
The other point I should like to make,
and which has been referred to, relates to
the financing of the work of the committee.
This session the committee has tried more
than 300 cases, representing in terms of
payments received, at say $200 a case, something of the order of $60,000, while the
estimate of cost, as has been said, is $125
a case, so that there may be said to be in
actual profit somewhere around $25,000 or
$30,000. The committee, of course, uses the
reporting staff to a certain extent; and certainly the divorce work interferes with the
freedom of members of the committee, many
of

whom would like to attend other com-

mittees. But I do not like to see the situation
exaggerated and the idea spread that the
Divorce Committee is preventing the Senate
from functioning in the most efficient manner. That is not so.
One word more, and that is with regard
to this "ditto, ditto" suggestion of my friend

AUGUST 5, 1958
from De la Durantaye (Hon. Mr. Pouliot).
My friend, I think, is misinformed or not
sufficiently informed with regard to the
character of the cases we try. It is true
that a certain number of them are of the
"hotel room" kind, but not all are, by any
means. I have given instructions quite recently to ascertain just how many cases
there are of that type, and I believe my
colleagues will be surprised at the percentage
of cases that do not arise from that type of
evidence. I have sat now as chairman of
this committee for the last five years and
I have come to have a greater confidence
rather than a lesser one in the professional
evidence that comes before us. We have
found the men who testify for wages, who
come back over and over again, to be
fairly responsible witnesses and I resent any
charge against them of perjury or fixing up
of cases, and so on, for after considerable
experience I do not feel that these are
frequent occurrences. They occur very seldom and I would not charge any of the
professional witnesses who come before us
with being guilty of an offence in this class.
Any such charge should be thoroughly
backed up with real knowledge and not based
on general statements alone. The taking of
notes by members of the committee would
be quite unsatisfactory. The report of the
committee's proceedings in each case goes
to the other chamber and the evidence must
be thoroughly reported.
Let me say a word of commendation of our
reporting staff. I have occasion to be very
familiar with their work in reporting these
cases, and I am sure all my colleagues on
the committee will agree with me when I
say that the reporting is of the very highest
class.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: They do their work in a
capable and faithful manner.
I am grateful to my honourable friend from
De la Durantaye for his kind attitude toward
the members of this committee. I thank him
for thinking hard, as he says, to find some
solution of the difficulties that face us in
doing this work. I hope he will go on thinking
hard.
Hon. Gunnar S. Thorvaldson: Honourable
senators, it bas been a great pleasure to
listen to a discussion such as this, and I just
want to contribute a very few words to it.
The reason I do so is that I was particularly
impressed by the fact that the debate was
commenced by the honourable senator from
De la Durantaye (Hon. Mr. Pouliot), although
I think it has probably gone off on a tangent
not intended by him. I may have misunderstood the honourable gentleman and if I did
57075-4-30

so I hope he will correct me, but I gather
from his remarks that he does not believe
divorces should be heard by the Senate. Well,
I just want to say that I agree with him
most heartily. A discussion such as this at
least gave the honourable senator from
Waterloo (Hon. Mr. Euler) an opportunity
to make the suggestion lie did, and it gives
me the opportunity to agree with him most
heartily. Perhaps if we had a debate like
this each session for a few years there might
be hope that in due course the honourable
senator from De la Durantaye and those
associated with him in his views, which of
course we respect, would support us in organizing proper courts for the two provinces
from which petitions for divorce now come
to Parliament. Then we could be rid of
what I deem to be a great nuisance to the
Parliament of this country, namely, that
senators are compelled to listen day by day
to divorce cases.
While I have said these things I do want
to pay my respects to the honourable senator
from Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck)
and commend him for the most efficient and
capable manner in which he continues the
work of chairman of this committee. Nothing
I have said is intended to detract from the
very faithful work that he does. However,
I am happy to have this opportunity of adding
my support to the few remarks that were
made by the honourable senator from
Waterloo (Hon. Mr. Euler).
Hon. Mr. Pouliot: When may we expect
the resolution, sooner or later?
Hon. Gustave Monette: Honourable senators,
I excuse myself for rising to speak tonight,
because I have not had time to look a little
more deeply into the question under discussion. I say, first, that all of us, on
both sides, are not very far apart on this
question. There may be a few topics on
which we in Quebec cannot agree with
honourable senators from the other provinces,
although we realize they are very sincere in
their suggestions. This question is very
serious, and I do not think that even the
senator from De la Durantaye (Hon. Mr.
Pouliot) has in mind any criticism of the
work of honourable senators who sit on the
Divorce Committee.
Hon. Mr. Pouliot: No. I said that last week.
Hon. Mr. Monette: On the contrary, lie has
complimented those who sit on the Divorce
Committee. Speaking from what I have
observed in this Chamber-I have not been
here long and I have not had the experience
that others have had in this field-I can say
that I am very gratified and enlightened by
the attention, sincerity and indefatigable

SENATE

work of the members of this house who
dispense justice in the hearing of divorce
cases. I do not think anybody in this house
doubts that.
I go a little further and say that I now
know personally many of the senators who sit
on the committee, and I judge them all by
the chairman, the honourable senator from
Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck). He is
not a young man; ho is not a precipitate man.
In this work his reports are not only always
fair and based on the evidence, but are also
in accordance with the law which allows
this committee to pronounce on divorce
petitions and forces the Senate to consider
them.
I should like to touch on another issue of
importance. It is suggested in some quarters
that Quebec should have its own divorce
courts. However, under the Constitution, that
is a matter left for the provinces to decide,
and we from Quebec do not think we are in
a position to accept such a suggestion. Furthermore, we do not feel that that suggestion
would be accepted in Quebec. Some may
honestly believe this stand on our part is
wrong; others may honestly believe it is
right. However, our religion does not favour
divorces. We do not feel that marriages
should be dissolved by courts, neither do we
believe they should bc broken by the authority of the Senate. Yet, it is the law under
our Canadian Constitution, and we have to
abide by it. I do not think any of us would
dispute the authority of this house in considering petitions for divorce and in relieving the parties after the hearing of evidence.
The framers of our Constitution provided
a remedy for people in Quebec seeking
divorce, by giving authority to the Senate
to hear their petitions, because it was felt
that the province of Quebec should not be
forced to have divorce courts if it did not
want them. Now we are living in times when
hundreds of divorce petitions a year are presented to the Senate and the number is continuing to increase. It has become an onerous
task. I do not think I am wrong when I
anticipate there will come a time when we
shall no longer be able to meet the situation,
and therefore it might be well to think now
of another remedy. The remedy would not
be to have divorce courts in the province
of Quebec, for that would only croate dissensions. I do not think we should be forced
to that solution. However, I am one of those
who do not believe that the hearing of divorce
petitions in either the Senate or in courts
set up in Quebec is the correct solution.
Being a relatively new senator in this house,
I do not think I am qualified to make suggestions. Like those of the Jewish tradition, I
prefer to leave it to a committee of our

elders, who in their wisdom and experience
could study the problem calmly and try to
find a better solution than exists at present.
Now, a suggestion of the honourable senator from De la Durantaye may appear unconstitutional or unwarranted under our
system of law. It was that petitioners from
Quebec and Newfoundland be allowed for
divorce purposes to establish temporary residence elsewhere. I am not in favour of that.
I think what the honourable senator meant
was that a domicile in another province might
be acquired for a time, and that after a
certain number of months of residence there
the petitioner might be qualified in law to
show that his domicile was established for
the time being in that province, whether it
be Ontario, Saskatchewan, Alberta, or some
other province. I am sure that the honourable senator did not mean that such persons
should be allowed to establish domicile illegally, or in a permanent manner, as perhaps
was suggested.
We in Quebec do not want to accept the
idea of a tribunal to pass on divorce cases.
And no doubt the courts in other provinces
would be annoyed if, in addition to the work
already imposed upon them, they were required to pass on divorce applications of
people who might appear to be legally domiciled in their provinces, but who, to all
intents and purposes, remained domiciled in
the province of Quebec or Newfoundland.
What, then, should be offered as a remedy?
I would not say at the moment. But I earnestly think that a committee composed of
members of both sides of this house could be
formed to study this matter, in an endeavour
to find a remedy, because ten years from now
we shall have 500 bills of divorce each session, and perhaps more.
Hon. Mr. Thorvaldson: We have nearly
500 now.
Hon. Mr. Monette: I thank the honourable
senator for correcting me.
I am sorry to say that some people honestly
feel the province of Quebec should be forced
to have divorce courts. This would not be a
proper remedy, for it would cause considerable discussion in Quebec and perhaps some
turmoil throughout the country. I do not fear
there will bo any leglislation of that kind. Let
us in Quebcc be free to think in our own
way, that marriage should be maintained and
should not be dissolved. I am one who feels
that some people live in terrible circumstances; they are tied together for life by
bonds of matrimony, and their plight is very
serious. But I am not going to suggest a
remedy; I am not going to suggest anything
that could be construed in my province as
approval on my part of dissolution of marriage by the courts. Such a conclusion is far

AUGUST 5, 1958
fromr
my mind; but I think I am sincere and
serious enough to admit that we are bound
to have to come in the near future to the
necessity for some modification of our present
system, and that in one way or another we
shall have to face the issue. Why not let us
face it immediately?
I beg honourable senators to accept my
suggestion for the appointment of an investigating committee. I make the suggestion with
profound respect for the opinion of others,
and in particular for that of all the members
of the Divorce Committee who do so great
and important a work. At the same time, I
would add this. It is true, as the honourable
senator from De la Durantaye said, that the
members of the Divorce Committee devote
considerable time to the work, and they are
among the ablest senators we have in this
house. However, when they are engaged in
this work we do not have the advantage of
their ability in dealing with public legislation
which comes before us for consideration. We
do not see these senators on other committees
often enough. I say this without reproach,
but with deep conviction, that among all the
senators here none impress me more than
those who see it as their duty to sit on
divorce matters and do a work which, though
important, is yet very tedious. But I do not
feel it is the right way to deal with the problem. I leave the issue in the hands of honourable senators.
Hon. Calvert C. Prati: Honourable senators,
I hesitate to speak on the subject of divorce,
because I have not participated in the onerous
duties that some honourable senators have
undertaken in this matter. I agree entirely
with what bas been said as to the appreciation we should show, and do show, toward
those who give of themselves unsparingly to
the work of the Divorce Committee. However,
I feel that we should seriously consider the
present systen for dealing with divorce petitions and try to provide one that would be
more generally acceptable. I submit it is not
in keeping with the traditions and duties of
the Parliament of Canada for members of
the Senate to devote so much of their time
to hearing evidence and adjudicating on the
marital troubles of individuals.
Some years ago I made a brief reference
in the Senate to this subject and I shall repeat
the essence of what I said at that time. I do
so because some honourable senators who have
spoken this evening have suggested that the
time has come to present ideas as to how this
problem can be dealt with. We could debate
this subject year after year and get nowhere,
while the work kept piling up until in time
the sheer weight of numbers of cases would
force it out of the jurisdiction of this chamber.
The suggestion I made formerly was this:
57075-4-301

Recognizing that divorce is a matter of parliamentary responsibility, we should set up
a body of paid officials outside the membership of this house to investigate cases, hear
evidence, and present findings to a committee
of the Senate. Parliament would then pass on
the recommendations presented to the committee, and it would not be necessary for
honourable senators to hear the evidence in
each case. The members of such a body would
probably be drawn from the legal profession,
and the fees that are paid now would probably
be ample to cover the cost. A committee of
members of the Senate, instead of reporting
their findings for the consideration of Parliament, would consider the report and recommendations of a paid professional body. The
evidence could be printed for review if necessary and much of the present procedure could
be followed, but individual senators would
be relieved of the burden of hearing evidence
in and passing judgment on hundreds of cases.
That is the suggestion I have to make,
honourable senators. It may not be entirely
complete in all its implications but I trust it
will be regarded as worthy of consideration.
Hon. Paul H. Bouffard: Honourable senators,
I have had the privilege in the past of sharing in the discussion about the proposed
establishment of divorce courts in the provinces of Quebec and Newfoundland. I was
moved at that time by the sincerity of all those
who spoke on this very difficult subject.
I am always a bit uneasy about speaking
on the subject of divorce, knowing, as I do,
of the conscientious work which the members
of the Divorce Committee are doing. I have
great respect for all members of the conmittee, who volunteer their services. I have
great respect for the work done by the former
chairman, the Leader of the Government in
this house (Hon. Mr. Aseltine), and for the
present chairman, the honourable senator
from Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck)
who bas served in that capacity for the past
five years. The work of these honourable
gentlemen deserves nothing but commendation.
The fact that some of us do not help with
the work of this committee makes me
uneasy to speak about it. As the chairman
of the conmittee and as the Leader of the
Government know, this matter has been
discussed very often. I have tried my best to
find some solution of the problem. First, I
attempted to get into a position where we
could help with the work of the committee;
unfortunately, that could not be arranged.
Up to the present time members of the Roman
Catholic Church have not taken part in the
work of the committee.

SENATE
I realize, as do all honourable senators,
that the work of the Divorce Committee is
increasing all the time, and that in years to
come it may not be possible for the committee
to handle the volume of work that will come
before it. A suggestion has been offered by
the honourable senator from Mille Isles (Hon.
Mr. Monette) that we form a committee to
study the matter. That course may have to
be followed in the near future. The honourable senator from St. John's West (Hon. Mr.
Pratt) has suggested that an arrangement
should be made whereby the committee would
be relieved from inquiring into the facts of
the cases by having assessors report findings
of fact. Such a suggestion has its merits
and may well offer a solution. No doubt the
two provinces concerned, Quebec and Newfoundland, would prefer this course to having
divorce courts forced upon them.
I have a suggestion which I would like to
offer to my honourable colleagues. In every
province of Canada-certainly in the province
of Quebec, and I am sure it is true of the
province of Newfoundland-married persons
can be separated as to bed and board for
reasons of adultery. I recall that when we
first discussed the matter of divorce in Parliament I was unable to offer the suggestion
I am now about to make for the reason that
in the province of Quebec a husband could
ask for separation as to bed and board on the
grounds of adultery, but a wife could not,
unless the adultery complained of had been
committed in the common domicile.
The
Quebec Legislature has now amended the law,
and the rights of a wife in this respect are
exactly those of her husband: both may ask
for separation of bed and board for reasons of
adultery. That obstruction has been removed.
My suggestion now is that a study be
made of the possibility, at least in so far as
Quebec is concerned, of requiring a petitioner
to Parliament for a divorce to submit a
judgment rendered by a court in the province
of Quebec granting separation as to bed and
board for reasons of adultery. This judgment,
being a final judgment of the Quebec court,
could not be challenged; the proof that adultery had beeen committed would be complete,
and the divorce could be granted without the
necessity of an inquiry, the judgment of the
Superior Court of Quebec being taken as good
and sound proof of adultery.
Hon. Mr. Moneite: As to the fact of
adultery.
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: As to the fact of
adultery. So an inquiry by the Senate would
be completely unnecessary. I am sure that,
were the proceedings handled in this way,
the committee, being able to dispense with
the hearing of witnesses and all the other

work involved in a court case, could handle
four or five times as many applications in
the same space of time as it does today.
That is one suggestion. It may not be a
good one, but I think it is worth studying.
Hon. Mr. Monette: May I put a question
to the honourable senator? Is it his suggestion that, the moment there is a final judgment in a court of the province of Quebec
establishing that adultery was committed, and
a separation is granted, all that would be
required here would be a mere petition, and
the Senate committee would be relieved from
the necessity of making a new inquiry and
could recommend a divorce?
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: That is what I mean.
The court judgment would be complete
proof of adultery.
Hon. Mr. Monette: I was aware of the suggestion, but I wished to give the honourable
senator from Grandville (Hon. Mr. Bouffard)
the opportunity to explain it himself.
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: I wholly agree that
there would be no reason for any further
inquiry before the Senate committee if a
judgment were rendered in the Superior
Court granting separation from bed and
board because of the commission of adultery.
Hon. Mr. Euler: The senator from Grandville suggests, as I understand him, that the
investigation would be made by some court
in the province of Quebec, which could
grant separation because of an act of adultery;
that the evidence would be brought before
the Divorce Committee here, and a divorce
could be granted on that evidence. Do I
understand him to mean that a divorce so
granted would give the parties the right to
remarry?
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: When a divorce is
granted, the right to remarry civilly is also
granted, irrespective of whether the proof
is made before

the Divorce

Committee

or

elsewhere.
The only obstacle that might
arise to the remarriage of one or other of
the parties is the religion to which he or she
belongs. That is the party's own business.
The fact that a divorce is granted does not
obligate either of the parties to remarry.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: But the honourable
senator suggests that every applicant from
the province of Quebec should have this decree of the provincial court before he comes
to the Senate?
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: Yes. It would be a
rule of the committee that no one from
Quebec could appear before it without producing a final judgment of separation as to

AUGUST 5, 1958
bed and board because of adultery. Otherwise, the petition would be ignored. This
condition would apply, of course, only ta
Quebec and Newfoundland, and the cornrittee
would of necessity accept the judgrnent of the
Superior Court as a deftnite presumaption that
adultery had been cornmitted.
Han. Mr. Thorvaldson: More than a presumption; it would be definite proof.
Hon. Mr. Boufiard: Yes-more than presumption. When I ta]k of presumption 1 arn
referring to a presumption that cannot be
destroyed. It would constitute complete proof
of adultery, following an inquiry which had
been made before the Superior Court, and
the judgment of that court would be produced, duly signed by the judge, before the
Senate. It would be complete proof of adultery; the judge would state in his judgrnent
that adultery has been conunitted.
Hon. Mr. Brunt: Can a similar iudgment
be obtained in Newfoundland?
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: I believe a judgrnent
of separation as ta, bed and board can be
had for adultery.
Hon. Mr. Euler: If a court in Quebec
finds that adultery is a cause for separation,
would divorce not necessarily follow? The
applicant would corne irnrediately ta the
Parliarnent of Canada for relief, and the
right ta divorce would have been really
established by the action of the Quebec court.
You are proposing a roundabout way of obtaining the sarne resuit.
Hon. Mr. Bauffard: I ar n ot of that opinion
at ail. There are many cases in Quebec where,
when adultery bas been cornmitted, separation
is granted as ta bed and board, but you are
far from having as many demands for divorce
as there are for separation as ta bed and
board. However, I do flot want ta discuss
the merits of the whole matter; we are only
considering suggestions for the purpose af
determining whether the cornmittee can be
relieved of rnuch af its work, in having ta
hear witnesses and conduct a fuil inquiry.
We perfectly understand how rnuch work
they have ta do, and are doing; we sympathize
with. thern, and we are trying ta lighten
their burden as far as we can. The honourable
senator frorn St. John's West <Hon. Mr. Pratt)
has made one suggestion, which I think it is
a good one, and I amn making another. I do
flot say it is perfect. I feel it niight be a
good plan ta forrn a committee where ail
these suggestions could be brought forward,
and perhaps during the course of discussionHon. Mr. Aseltîne: There is nothing new
about any of these suggestions. They were
ail made and discussed a couple af years ago

when I introduced a bill ta arnend the Exchequer Court Act with regard ta divorce
jurisdiction. The bill was defeated by a big
mai ority, and I do flot believe we are gaining anything by going into ail this now.
Han. Mr. Tharvaldsan: I think we are
gaining sornething; it is a very worth-wbile
discussion.
Han. Mr. Bouffard: I do not want ta discuss
divorce; I ar nfot the one who brought the
matter Up.
Hon. Mr. Howard: You are just making a
suggestion.
Hon. Mr. Bauffard: Some member ai the
bouse asked if any suggestions could be made,
and that is wbat I arn doing. I ar n ot saying
whether the decision an the honourable
gentlemnan's biil was a good one. I know
we had a clear-cut discussion at the time
and that he was extrernely smncere, as were
ail of us who took part in the debate. But
if we want to do sornething for the Divorce
Cornmittee let us make sorne suggestions, and
perhaps they rnay be better considered now
than they were two years ago. It rnay be
that we are better prepared now ta listen
ta suggestions on lightening the burden of
honourable members wbo serve on the cornrnittee. That is the only reason for my speaking at this tirne. 1 make these rernarks
particularly for the benefit of those rnernbers
who did not bave the privilege of llstening
ta the discussion that took place when the
honourable gentlernan's bill was introduced
here. I have no more suggestions ta make
tonigbt, but if a committee were iormed
perhaps I would present some ta it.
Hon. Mr. Manette: Does the honourable
senator frarn Grandville (Hon. Mr. Bouffard)
bold the view that there is jurisdiction in
Quebec ta separate a man and wife as ta bed
and board on the ground af adultery?
Hon. Mr. Bauffard: Sure there is.
Han. Mr. Manette: But there is no jurisdiction in Quebec ta pronounce divorce at
the same tirne. Is it the suggestion of my
honourable friend that when adultery bas
been proven and separation as to bed and
board bas been granted, the innocent party
could corne ta Parliament with a copy af
that judgment and ifie suit for divorce, Parliament having jurisdiction ta pronounce
divorce on the ground oi adultery? As I
understand rny hanourable friend's suggestion, the proof ai adultery would be made in
the province of Quebec on the occasion af
an action for separation as ta bed and board,
and that proof would be autornaticaily accepted by Parliament. In ather words, the

AUGUST 5, 1958
for divorce, and each year there is a balance
which goes to the general revenue of the
country.
I have been a member of the Divorce
Committee, much against my wishes, ever
since I first came to the Senate. I tried to
be excused, but nevertheless I felt it was
my duty to attend, and have done so faithfully for over eleven years.
It seems to me that this question of divorce
goes back to the time of Confederation,
when the constitution gave Parliament
authority to deal with it. The people of
Quebec-English-speaking as well as Frenchspeaking-did not want to submit their
marital problems to divorce courts in Quebec, and in so far as that province is concerned divorce applications have been dealt
with in the Senate.
Most of the provinces of Canada now have
divorce courts of their own, and the hearing
of divorce petitions by the Senate is limited
to those from Quebec and Newfoundland.
Fortunately, this problem has not affected
Newfoundland very much as yet; we receive
very few cases from that province, and I
believe it does not want a divorce court of
its own.
So far as the Committee on Divorce in
the Senate is concerned, may I as a humble
member of that committee say that I think
it does excellent work. There are lawyers
on that committee who I believe would grace
the bench of any province in Canada. The
recommendations of the committee are very
seldom interfered with by the other house.
Honourable senators, what seems strange
to me is that the people who complain about
the work of the Divorce Committee are not
those who carry out the work. Usually, the
members of the committee do not complain.
They work hard and faithfully and carry
out their duties well. I think we should be
very careful not to disturb the good work
now being done by the Committee, until it
can be shown that there is a better way to
deal with the problem.
The honourable senator from St. John's
West (Hon. Mr. Pratt) suggested that a body
be set up of qualified persons, other than
senators, to hear evidence on divorce, and
report to the Senate. I do not think the
Senate should be expected to pass on divorce
applications without having first heard the
evidence.
The honourable senator from Grandville
(Hon. Mr. Bouffard) made a suggestion to
which I think there are many objections. Not
all the people of Quebec are against divorce.
May I point out that many persons in that
province who come here for a divorce already
have a separation from bed and board; and

although none of the testimony with regard
to the separation comes before us, the fact
that a separation has been granted helps the
committee to dispose of a petition with a
clear conscience.
A great many people say that it is not in
keeping with the dignity of the Senate to
deal with matters of divorce and that the
Senate could be doing better work for the
country. Let me remind honourable senators
that divorce is a human problem, that the
committee deals with serious personal
troubles. Doctors, nurses and other professional people also deal with human problems,
and there must be a great many tasks they
dislike to perform. I think the Senate can
handle divorce cases without losing its dignity.
The fact that the petitions come only from the
province of Quebec is, of course, saddening.
Personally, I am against divorce. I do not
believe in it and, if I could do so, I would
abolish it in this country; but I realize that
we have to be practical, in the light of the
demand for it by certain people. I think it
speaks well of the work of the Divorce Committee that there are fewer divorces in Quebec than in most other provinces of Canada.
My friend from Winnipeg South (Hon. Mr.
Thorvaldson) said there are 500 a year in
Quebec. I think there are only about 400. I
believe the highest number occurred after
World War II as a result of marriages hastily
contracted during those years. Otherwise the
figures are fairly steady. There are more
than 2,000 divorces a year in Ontario, and
it seems to me that the requirement that
petitioners from Quebec must come to the
Senate for relief tends to keep down an evil.
Looking at it from ail aspects, and I have
done so for many years, I think the existing
set-up is a good one.
At one time I was asked by a former Government authority to make a report on what
could be done on the matter of divorce. One
suggestion I offered was that the Senate be
made a final court without recourse to the
other house. If that were agreed upon, of
course, it would be said that the Senate in
that respect was not the Parliament of Canada, and that before it could become a court
of final jurisdiction the other house might
want to have something to say about it. My
own view now is that under the present
arrangement by which the people of Quebec
can apply for divorce through this house,
with the proceedings being reviewed by the
other house, it can truly be said that cases
are being dealt with by the regular processes
of the Parliament of Canada. There is a lot
to be said for that procedure. I was once
speaking to an eminent judge of the Supreme
Court of Nova Scotia, who said that that
province had no particular judge assigned to

SENATE

the hearing of divorce cases but that the
cases were assigned to any of the judges.
Honourable senators, I am against taking
divorce out of the Senate. I took that stand
earlier, and I think I would do so again,
unless someone could show me a better way.
I think it is a matter of the spirit. After all,
in this country no man should be challenged
for the way he wishes to walk humbly before
his God. If the people of Quebec do not want
a divorce court, we should not force one upon
them; but I do think that they should regard
what we are doing as a duty, as a service, and
should not wash their hands altogether of the
work of the Divorce Committee in the Senate.
Also, the Divorce Committee should not have
to face unfair or erroneous suggestions, perhaps based on lack of information. The
committee itself is not complaining; it is getting along splendidly; it is doing a good work
and is following a path that has existed for
a long time. So I say, unless you can replace
it with something that has more merit, that
will not disturb the people of this country,
and that will not make divorces more numerous, we had better go along as we are.
Hon. Cyrille Vaillancourt: Honourable senators, I have only a few words to say and they
will be confined to a question of principle.
We are against divorce in the province of
Quebc, not only because we are Catholics but
because we want to preserve the family, and
we know that the basis of a nation is the
family. If we increase the facilities for getting a divorce the family will quickly be
destroyed.
Morcover, immediately divorce courts were
organized in Ontario and other provinces the
number of divorces increased-they doubled,
trebled and in some cases, even increased to
four and five times what they were before.
According to the figures given by the honourable senator who preceded me, (Hon. Mr.
Kinley) Quebec divorces, except for the period
immediately following the last war, have been
decreasing, and this year there has been a
definite decrease. There are no more than
303 divorce petitions before us this year, while
in previous years there were something of
the order of 500. So I am safe in saying that
the divorce rate in Quebec is decreasing.
Now, if we were to organize divorce courts
in the province of Quebec we would open
the door, and I am sure we would find that
the number of divorces would be doubled,
and might even run to five and ten times the
present number.
Honourable senators, let me relate an experience that I had two or three months ago.
In a certain locality in the province of Quebec
the people asked the Government to license
more liquor outlets in the locality in order to

throttle the activities of blind pigs. The government did what they asked. As a result of
that, now you can get liquor everywhere in
this locality, and the people are consuming
more liquor.
You know, when we open a door we invite
people to enter. If you have only one door
in a house everybody is obliged to use that
door, but if you have five or six doors in the
house many people can come in at the same
time and do what they want.
I put that forward as a question of principle
and, as I said, it is based on protection of the
family. The family is the basis, the foundation, of the nation, and in trying to preserve
the spirit of the family we are doing a very
splendid work for our country. That is an
expression of our principles.
Hon. W. Ross Macdonald: Honourable senators, I do not intend to take much of the
time of the house. I will not add to what has
been said by honourable members respecting
their feelings toward the Chairman of the
Divorce Committee and his committee, all of
whom are doing excellent work. I have
expressed my views in that respect on other
occasions. My respect and admiration for them
bas increased, if that is possible, rather than
decreased.
I cannot agree entirely with the Leader of
the Government (Hon. Mr. Aseltine) when he
suggests that this discussion is a waste of
time. I think it bas been a very helpful discussion and I am sure some good will come
of it. He referred to the fact that when he
presented a bill before this house a number
of years ago these suggestions were brought
forward, but I remind him-and this was
mentioned earlier tonight-that at that time
a woman in the province of Quebec had a
great deal of difficulty in obtaining a separation as to bed and board. It was almost impossible for her to get it. But as we have
heard here tonight, the law of Quebec in that
respect has been changed.
The law had

changed before I brought in my bill dealing
with divorce.
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: Not before your bill
was brought in.

before I brought in my bill to amend the
Exchequer Court Act. My honourable friend
told me so.
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: That is quite right.

to the contrary.
Many points of view have been brought
forward in the discussion tonight. One matter

My associate on my left (Hon. Mr. Vaillancourt) referred to the fact that there are
fewer divorce petitions from Quebec before
Parliament this year than last year.

Hon. Léon Méthot: Honourable senators,
I think we are missing the point. We must
admit that the granting of a divorce is by
act of Parliament. Are we to ask Parliament

NEWFOUNDLAND

FINANCES

REPORT OF ROYAL COMMISSION

Hon. Calveri C. Prati rose in accordance
with the following notice:
That he will draw the attention of the Senate
te the report of the Royal Commission on Newfoundland Finances under the terms of Union of
Newfoundland with Canada.

He said: Honourable senators, last week
there was tabled in this house a report by
the McNair Commission which was set up
to gather facts and make recommendations
with regard to the terms of Union as between
the province of Newfoundland and the
Dominion of Canada. The terms agreement
was signed on December 11, 1948, by six
appointed representatives of Newfoundland,
one of whom was our colleague from
Bonavista-Twillingate (Hon. Mr. Bradley).
There were seven on the committee, but one
refused to sign because he judged the terms
were inadequate for the needs of Newfoundland. The signatories to the agreement on
behalf of Canada were the Right Honourable
Louis S. St. Laurent, Prime Minister, and
the Honourable Brooke Claxton.
The revision of the financial conditions of
the agreement was provided for in clause 29.
The implications of that clause are well known
to the people of my province. Naturally,
they are not so well known here, so I shall
now quote the clause:
In view of the difficulty of predicting with sufficient accuracy the financial consequences to Newfoundland of becoming a province of Canada, the

Government of Canada will appoint a Royal Commission within eight years from the date of
Union to review the financial position of the Province of Newfoundland and to recommend the form
and scale of additional financial assistance, if any,
that may be required by the Government of the
Province of Newfoundland to enable«it to continue
public services at the levels and standards reached
subsequent to the date of Union, without resorting
to taxation more burdensome, having regard to
capacity to pay, than that obtaining generally in the
region comprising the Maritime provinces of Nova
Scotia, New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island.

The general purpose was to defer for
eight years consideration of a permanent
form of federal financial assistance in relation to public services of the new province.
Personally, I think the clause was altogether
too circumscribed, because it just took for
granted that in eight years' time the public
services would be a permanent establishment and on a top-level of development.
Enough thought, I feel, was not given to the
fact that Newfoundland would then have
been only eight years in the federal family,
whereas most of the other members had
lived together for eighty years.
For such a clause as No. 29 to have anything like full and helpful meaning there
should have been provision for reviews and
adjustments well

into

the future.

Union

with Canada has brought many changes.
Some of them, of course, have been very
beneficial, while others, particularly as
affecting some aspects of our foreign trade,
have been adverse in relation to our experiences of former years. Under the signed
agreement a transitional grant of $6,500,000
per year was made but, after three years,
that grant was to be diminished yearly until
it completely petered out in twelve years.
This limitation, I contend, did not reveal
very great understanding and certainly not
generosity nor, indeed, liberality. I won't
say any more about that, but we can each
think up what opposite words we like and
apply them to that remark.
I shall deal later, if I may, with some of
the implications of clause 29 and the commission's report itself.
At this point it might be useful for me
to review some of the circumstances applicable to the promotion of the movement for
the entry of Newfoundland into Canada.
General background of knowledge as well
as awareness of the circumstances currently
prevailing at that time are essential to a
proper evaluation of the case under consideration.
Newfoundland had gone through almost a
century of responsible government, with the
exception of a period of fifteen years during
which it had voluntarily surrendered elected
government for a government by commission. That situation arose out of the financial

AUGUST 6. 1958
difficulties of Newfoundland in the depression following the First World War and
became particularly acute by reason of
world-wide depression in the early thirties.
That depressed condition, as we all know,
was universal, hitting some parts of Canada
just as hard as it did Newfoundland. The
wide expanse and diversification of its economy gave to Canada the advantage of an
averaging out and levelling off of the terrible
difficulties of that time. Newfoundland, as a
small, separate entity had no such advantage.
In 1931 the Newfoundland Government
found it difficult to pay the normal expenses
of administration, as well as to pay the interest on its bonded indebtedness. The British
Government was asked to appoint a commission to survey Newfoundland's affairs and to
make recommendation for future policy.
Resulting from that, a commission of Government came into being in 1934 and the opera.on of responsible Government was suspended from that time until the Union with
Canada in 1949.
I might say that the major issue at the
time of the inauguration of commission of
Government was the inability of Newfoundland to raise funds to pay the interest and
amortization of its national indebtedness. Had
Newfoundland decided simply to default, the
Government might possibly have been able
to raise enough revenue to carry on its
meagre services, but there was almost unanimous approval of a policy to suspend responsible government. It was provided that Great
Britain would guarantee the public debt, most
of which was converted to sterling.
It is, I think, without precedent for a
Government to vote itself out of existencee
to preserve national solvency, but, while the
complete loss of democratic government -vas
regrettable, the procedure, nevertheless, refiected a widespread desire to honour
obligations.
During the Second World War and immediately afterward, many factors came in to
improve Newfoundland's economic position.
Industry, generally, had received a great impetus and, in fact, three years after the end
of the war Newfoundland's import and export trade totalled $147 million, compared
with a total of $56 million just prior to the
war. During that period there was a very
substantial reduction in the public indebtedness.
To sum up this short review of the finances
of Newfoundland at that time, I might say
that immediately prior to Union there was a
net public debt in sterling of about £151
million, which, calculated at the rate of exchange to come into effect shortly after,
totalled about $45 million. This under the

terms of Union was accepted as a liability by
the dominion Government. A portion of the
public debt of about $10 million remained a
provincial liability. There was a cash reserve
accumulated during commission of Government years to the amount of $40 million. This
was retained by the province.
By the acquisition of the major part of the
public debt of Newfoundland, Canada increased its national debt by a relatively insignificant amount. It is not unreasonable to
point out that when Newfoundland became
a province it, naturally, assumed its share of
responsibility for the Canadian national debt
which has its reflection in various forms of
current taxation. Not one dollar of that debt,
however, had, prior to Union, been spent in
the development of the public services of
Newfoundland. As some considerable portion
of the Canadian national debt over the years
resulted from the establishment of public
services in other areas of Canada, this
naturally set up a deferred liability to Newfoundland for the same purpose.
Hon. Mr. Euler: May I ask my honourable
friend a question? By how much, in terms
of dollars, was the national debt of Canada
increased by adding to it the public debt of
Newfoundland when it was taken over?
Hon. Mr. Prati: $45 million.
Hon. Mr. Euler: My friend said an insignificant sum.
Hon. Mr. Pratt: I say it is insignificant in
relation to the total national debt. Don't misunderstand me; $45 million is not an insignificant sum, but in relation to the total public
debt of Canada at that time I say it might be
regarded as insignificant.
I would like to bring out clearly the fact
that Canada did not take over a debt-ridden
province. From some of the newspaper writings of that period, and since, it certainly
appears that that fact had not sunk into
Canadian minds generally. While the living
standards and the public services within Newfoundland were at a relatively low level at
the time of Union and the responsibility was
certainly in the offing for the federal Government to bring about some uniformity of citizenship status, there was no great assumption
of public debt by the federal Government.
As I have said, this assumption of public
debt was not great in relation to the sum total
of the public debt of Canada, or in relation
to, as I shall point out in a moment, the
assets that Canada acquired which, had Newfoundland been a province, would over the
years have cost many times the amount of
the debt assumed.
Continuing with some background information on the movement for Union with Canada,

SENATE

I might point out that with the improvement
in Newfoundland's economy and financial
position in the later years of the 1940's the
United Kingdom was actually under obligation to bring about a restoration of responsible
government. Instead of doing that directly it
had decided that a National Convention would
be set up to examine into the possible forms
of government for Newfoundland, and three
were brought forward for consideration. That
convention consisted of 45 elected members,
each a resident of the constituency which
elected him. In the early days of the convention a resolution was passed to send a
delegation to Ottawa for the purpose of ascertaining "if a fair and equitable basis"
existed for Union with Canada. The delegation was instructed to explore and not to
negotiate, and in fact nothing had been done
about preparing a case in that connection.
As a result of that visit, terms were presented by the Right Honourable Mr. Mackenzie King, then Prime Minister, and were
a major consideration in a referendum by
which people were to choose between restoration of responsible government for Newfoundland of itself and Union with Canada. The
vote recorded a majority of 52.3 per cent in
favour of Union with Canada. It is a matter
of recorded fact that the outstanding cause
of opposition to Union at that time was that
the people were called upon to vote on unnegotiated terms. Actually, it was found that
the teris which had been constructed unilaterally were so ill-considered and deficient
that if they had not been amended after the
vote and before Union came into being, Newfoundland's public finances would have shown
a frightful deficit in the first year, although
for some time previously they had been running with a substantial surplus.
The first presentation of teris was lacking
in understanding, not only of Newfoundland's
needs but of its actual position at the time.
The official statement of prospective revenue
and expenditure as between the federal and
provincial Governments anticipated a deficit
to the Government of Canada of $61 million.
This was stated as being apart from debt
servicing and anticipated railroad deficit. The
important thing here is that it was formally
stipulated that while the general conditions
could be subject to further consideration, the
financial provisions took care of as large a
deficit as the federal Government could
consider.
Just by way of illustration of the confusing
implications of that statement, I might point
out that in the summing up of the anticipated
federal revenue from Newfoundland, as a
new province, consideration was given only
to what would be recorded as direct contribution to the revenue and nothing whatever

to what might flow indirectly to the federal
Government through Newfoundland's relationship with the other provinces. It was
anticipated and provided for in the official
calculations that the swing of trade would be
away from local manufacture and foreign
importations to sales by the other provinces
to Newfoundland.
The application in the submitted teris of
that correctly anticipated situation was simply
incredible. As an example-and I cite this
simply as an example-Newfoundland was
given credit in the listing of the revenue for
$400,000 federal revenue from liquor taxes
and $500,000 federal revenue from tobacco
taxes. Based on the consumption of both
liquor and tobacco at that time in Newfoundland and calculated on the federal rate of
taxes then prevailing, the total contribution
just from that source would be $61 million
instead of $900,000. That difference alone
was almost enough to wipe out the entire
anticipated deficit set out in the statement
that was presented. When officials were
questioned some time later as to the origin
of the $400,000 and $500,000 revenue estimates,
the answer was simply that it was anticipated
that Newfoundland would be turning its
trade for those products to the other provinces from which excise and other duties
would be paid, so that Newfoundland should
not get credit for those returns. There was
no note of explanation whatever in the document. I could go on and explain other misleading

discrepancies

within

that

formai

presentation which would illustrate more
than anything else the opposition of that time
to the approach-and I say "approach"-to
the Confederation movement.
I say again that, had the Newfoundland
position been adequately surveyed and the
terms properly negotiated at the start, we
would probably have had a very heavy
majority for Confederation instead of a favourable vote of just 52.3 per cent. My guess
is that there would have been a favourable
vote of at least 80 per cent. But who knows?
I might mention here that the movement
was a game of chance as far as the working
out of suitable terms was concerned. The
leading advocates thought the chance was
worth taking-and at this stage, who disputes
it?-because two previous approaches to Union
had broken down in 1867 and 1894 for the
reason that terms adequate to Newfoundland's
special needs and conditions could not be
agreed upon.
Ail this has a bearing on the reason for
revision of the terms. It is true that after
Newfoundland voted itself into Union a delegation of seven highly-respected citizens did
carry on a negotiation of terms at Ottawa

AUGUST 6, 1958
before the final consummation of Union. The
adjustment was substantial.
The negotiations were carried on, however,
with Union as an accomplished fact. Personally, I always considered that this was a most
unreasonable circumstance. I had an opportunity of reading the typewritten reviews of
the week-by-week discussions and it was
evident to me that there was a hold-back
attitude by reason of the fact that, for all
intents and purposes, Newfoundland was
definitely a province.
During the first year of Union I was in
Ottawa six times with trade and provincial
delegations trying to get action on exchange
and other difficulties in connection with our
foreign trade. The most frustrating feature
of all, I found, in official circles was a lack
of recognition that many of Newfoundland's
problems were unique or were not common to
other parts of Canada-at least not in the
same degree of importance. There was always
a prevailing fear of establishing a precedent
which might have to be carried into other
provinces. The special circumstances of Newfoundland, living apart from the other areas
of Canada through the centuries, with living
conditions and standards entirely different,
with public services and everything one can
think of on a different plane, should have
caused a far broader outlook than was in
evidence. What was intended to be the saving
factor in the establishment of our relationship
under Union was the insertion in the terms of
clause 29, which I have quoted.
What I have said so far has been largely
historical background-some very recent history, it is true-but such a subject as this, I
feel, requires to be dealt with in the light
not only of the present but of the past and
the future.
I shal now bring to your attention more of
the present-day facts bearing on this issue.
I won't burden you with reading again clause
29, but I would repeat that the purpose of
the Royal Commission, expressed briefly, was
to recommend financial assistance to the province, so that it could continue public services
without resorting to taxation more burdensome, having regard to capacity to pay, than
that obtaining generally in the Maritime provinces. This causes us now to take a look at
some of the factors immediately involved.
The matter of the continuation of public
services, as well as present-day standards,
is the outstanding issue. I can only at this
time give you a few scattered facts.
Let us consider roads for a moment, which
are a first essential to progress everywhere.
It is a recognized fact that the standard of
Newfoundland's roads generally is much
below that of the other provinces. In Newfoundland there are 16.7 miles for each 1,000

of population, compared with 24.7 miles in
the three Maritime provinces. From 1950
to 1954 the registration of motor vehicles
went from about 16,000 to about 40,000. If
the Maritime standard of the number of
vehicles for each mile of road applied to
Newfoundland, the province would have 5,000
more miles of roads, or about double what
it has now. The application of the TransCanada Highway policy, whereby the cost
in the main is shared fifty-fifty between the
federal and provincial Governments, is not
practical in the present condition of the
economy of our province. In view of the
lack of road facilities and the impossibility
of adapting some existing roads to the
Trans-Canada system, there should very
definitely have been special provision for
our province rather than the all-round fiftyfifty application.
I would now mention education. School
accommodation is lamentably lacking. Enrolment per classroom is the highest in
Canada, and in 1955 the schools had an
average of 4.6 more students per classroom
than the schools throughout the Maritime
provinces had. A vigorous effort has been
made by the Government with, I might say,
marvellous public co-operation, to correct this
position, but all one sees is a constant
wrestling with increasing difficulties.
In the matter of public health, while the
hospital facilities in St. John's and the larger
communities have increased substantially
and cottage hospitals have been spread
around many of the outlying areas, there is
still a great deficiency, compared with other
parts of Canada. Newfoundland has 28 per
cent less hospital capacity on a population
basis than have the Maritime provinces.
Infant mortality is considerably higher than
the average for the other provinces, and the
incidence of tuberculosis is more than twice
as high as in the three Maritime provinces.
The disease used to be Newfoundland's worst
plague, and notwithstanding the great progress that has been made in combating it,
there is still need for greater effort.
At this point, when bringing to your attention matters of education and public health
particularly, I might say that the report of
the commission seems to me to be far too
much a battle of statistics. I have reviewed
the case presented on behalf of the Government of Newfoundland to the commission. It
does appear that in the very strict adherence
to the precise terms of reference, matters of
great human concern have not been adequately
provided for in the official report. As an
instance of this, no apparent consideration
bas been given to the fact that 41 per cent of
the population in 1956 was under 15 years
of age, compared with 32 per cent for the

SENATE
whole of Canada. The average number of
persons in a Newfoundland family is 4.6,
compared with 3.8 throughout Canada. As
just one of the many economic implications
of this problem I might mention that the
larger number of children per family places
in a different perspective the application
of the per capita wage earnings. It also has
a pronounced effect on the relative proportion of income which can be applied to the
cost of education and social services and it
affects the taxable capacity of the population.
The development and maintenance of strictly
provincial services in Newfoundland is particularly difficult because of the province's
somewhat fluctuating economy. One of the
measures to meet the difficulty was the
imposition of a sales tax of 3 per cent on all
retail sales throughout the province, applying to food and ahl other commodities. When
we consider higher costs of goods by reason
of freight from the other provinces and distributing charges, the application bears very
heavily on the average wage earner.
Union of Newfoundland with Canada was
not a one-sided deal by any means; it brought
advantages both ways. To the Newfoundland
people it brought the hopes of extension of
public and welfare services, which Newfoundland as a separate entity could not
possibly undertake with any assurance of
continued maintenance. Some of these hopes
are unquestionably in the course of being
realized now.
The union brought to Canada the realization of its national hopes in the extension
of its geographical boundary, as well as distinct material advantages. The established
defence relationship with the United States
in Newfoundland ran into hundreds of millions of dollars of capital expenditure and
tens of millions of yearly expense, some part
of which Canada would otherwise have had
to meet. Then there is Gander airport, which
at the time of Union was-as it still is-one
of the greatest in the world. It was acquired
by Canada without any payment to Newfoundland. The railway of over 600 milesof narrow gauge, it is true, and a most inadequate public service-was transferred
without compensation. Its revenue is less
than current expenditure, but that is true of
many federal public services. The great area
of Labrador, consisting of 112,000 square
miles, will undoubtedly bring tremendous
wealth to Canada as a whole as the years
roll on and as the resources of that territory
with those of the island of Newfoundland,
are developed. The almost complete switch of
purchasing of manufactured goods from other
parts of the world to the Canadian provinces
is a matter of great importance to Canada.

Only one-tenth of the agricultural requirements are produced locally and the secondary manufacturing industries provide jobs
for no more than 3 per cent to 4 per cent of
those gainfully employed.
The report of the Royal Commission has
recommended that the federal Government
pay the province of Newfoundland $8 million
per year as from April 1957, less the transitional grants for which Canada was obligated under the terms of 1948. In other
words, the amounts over the present payments which will be due if these recommendations are accepted will be $6,600,000
for 1957 and running up to $8 million in
1961 and thereafter. The Newfoundland Government had set up an investigating body for
the purpose of studying the case of the
province in this connection, and the recommendations were for $15 million annually.
I am not sure that I can question the
recommendations of the Royal Commission,
though I think that they are somewhat lacking with regard to the amounts required. I
certainly could not question their recommendations from the standpoint of correct
arithmetic and the dictionary interpretation
of each word of the terms of reference. What
I do question is the complete inadequacy of
the whole approach, which it is true was beyond the responsibility of the commission,
but in fairness to the whole issue I think
emphasis in the report should have been
placed on matters of broader significance,
even though for the present the monetary
recommendations might have been the same.
To focus one's mind entirely on the present in planning for the future just invites
failure. In that respect the conditions of
clause 29 are obviously lacking. What has
to be thought into that clause, even though
it could not be written into it in 1949, is
provision for the public services of 1957
which in 1949 were even unplanned. Then
again if the province was behind in development of those essential public services in
recent years, as is the case, why should not
the measure of financial assistance be
extended to continuing expansion instead of
ending with the established services of 1957?
I know that no commission can take care
of everything for the future, but here is a
case where the province of Newfoundland
entered into a new economic world, so to
speak.
There undoubtedly should have been
recommendations for future adjustments in
the financial relationships, bearing in mind
the varying nature of the economy of the
province and the population changes.
When this report has been considered by
the Government of Canada, I hope that a

AUGUST 6, 1958
broader policy, both for the present and for
the future, will be announced than is
envisaged in this document.
If Union with Canada is to be the success
for Newfoundland that it should be and can
be, there has to be a constant recognition of
the many problems that are not common to
the other provinces. Newfoundland needs
close understanding in these days of transition and that need will continue into the
future. That understanding is particularly
necessary in departmental administration of
the federal Government.
As I have said before, Newfoundland
entered into Union with Canada trusting
that it would receive fair treatment, and not
as a result of hard preliminary bargaining.
Personally, I believe, and I am sure the
Newfoundland people generally believe, that
the will for fair treatment exists on both
sides, but to implement that will there must
be provision for close and constant understanding of the vast difference between the
circumstances of Newfoundland and those of
the other provinces.
I think it would be applicable in the circumstances for me to end this talk by quoting the Rowell-Sirois Commission report of
1940, which recommended grants to provinces
designed "to make it possible for every province to provide for its people services of
average Canadian standards and they will
thus alleviate distress and shameful conditions which now weaken national unity and
handicap many Canadians.
They are the
concrete expression of the commission's conception of a federal system which will both
preserve a healthy local autonomy and build
a stronger and more united nation."

LAND

USE

REPORT REFERRED BACK

TO COMMITTEE

The Senate proceeded to consideration of
the second report of the Special Committee
on Land Use in Canada.
Hon. Arthur M. Pearson, Chairman of the
committee, moved, with leave:
That the report be not now taken into consideration, but that it be referred back to the
Special Committee of the Senate on Land Use in
Canada.

Hon. Mr. Roebuck: May we have an
explanation?
Hon. Mr. Pearson: The explanation, honourable senators, is that at the time this
motion was brought in the committee felt
that it should accept an invitation from a
private company to view research work being
carried out in forestry at a place outside
the city of Ottawa. However, the committee
now feels that it does not need to visit
places other than Ottawa, and at present
it is endeavouring to bring in an interim
report. No further meetings will be held this
session.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, is it your pleasure to adopt the
motion?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: I do not understand
it yet.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: I gather that what the
honourable senator means is that the committee now desires to withdraw the report
before the house, inasmuch as it does not
wish to proceed with the recommendation
which the report makes. Is that it?
Hon. Mr. Pearson: Yes.
Motion agreed to.
The Senate adjourned until tomorrow at
3 p.m.

APPROPRIATION BILL No. 4, 1958
FIRST READING

The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, a message has been received from the
House of Commons with Bill C-46, for granting to Her Majesty certain sums of money
for the public service of the financial year
ending the 31st of March, 1959, to which they
desire the concurrence of the Senate.
Bill read first time.
SECOND READING

The Hon.

the

Speaker: Honourable sena-

tors, when shall this bill be read the second
time?
Hon. W. M. Aselline: Honourable senators,

I move that the bill be read the second time
now.
Honourable senators, this is another interim
supply bill. It is intituled "An Act for granting to Her Majesty certain sums of money
for the public service of the financial year
ending the 31st March, 1959".
Some weeks ago, by Appropriation Bill
No. 2, we voted $626,292,380.09 for the
months of April and May, which was onesixth of the main estimates, plus additional
proportions of some 42 items. Later, by
Appropriation Bill No. 3, we voted $624,592,837.43 for the months of June and July, which
was one-sixth of the main estimates, plus
some additional 20 items, plus five items in
the supplementary estimates. By this bill,
which if passed, will be known as Appropriation Act No. 4, we are being asked to vote
$615,999,671.59 for the months of August and
September, being the aggregate of (a) onesixth of the total of the amounts of the items

set forth in the main estimates, plus onetwelfth of four items only, except six items,
of which eleven-twelfths have already been
voted; (b) an additional five-twelfths of
three items; (c) an additional one-quarter
of four items; (d) an additional one-twelfth
of fifteen items; (e) an additional one-sixth
of the supplementary estimates, except four
items, of which eleven-twelfths have already
been voted; and (f) an additional one-sixth
of two supplementary items.
Generally
speaking, the additional appropriations are
required now because of the bulk of the
work having had to be done during the
summer months.
I also want to make a reference to the
form of the bill. It will be remembered that
the honourable Leader of the Opposition
(Hon. Mr. Macdonald) was very pleased with
the form of Appropriation Bill No. 2. When
we received Appropriation Bill No. 3 it was
not in the same form as Appropriation Bill
No. 2, and he made certain objections, which
I conveyed to the proper officials of the
Government. I am pleased to advise honourable senators that we now have a bill in the
form of Appropriation Bill No. 2, which I
believe was considered by honourable members of the Senate to set out the different
items in a way that was an improvement on
the form of previous supply bills.
The proportions requested in this bill are
intended to provide all the necessary requirements of the public service up until September 30, 1958. In no instance is the total
amount of any item, in either the main
estimates or the supplementary estimates,
released by this bill.
The passing of this bill will not prejudice
the rights or privileges of honourable senators
to criticize any item when it comes up for
consideration, and the usual undertaking is
hereby given that such rights and privileges
will be respected and will not be curtailed
or restricted in any way as a result of the
passing of this measure.
Honourable senators, this is a brief explanation of the bill and I have nothing further to
say with respect to the same unless certain
questions are asked.
Hon. A. K. Hugessen: Honourable senators, in the absence of the Leader of the
Opposition (Hon. Mr. Macdonald) my first
task, and it is a very pleasant one, is to
thank the Leader of the Government (Hon.
Mr. Aseltine) for having taken notice of
the observations my leader made on the occasion of the previous supply bill and having
this bill introduced in a more acceptable form.
I do not think any of us on this side of
the house have any criticism of the form of
this bill, though of course we do carry in
our minds the general thought that it is a

AUGUST 7, 1958
bill to provide a part of the financial requirements of the country in a year in which the
estimated deficit of expenditures over income
is a record in the history of this dominion,
having been calculated by the Minister of
Finance himself at something of the order of
$650 million.
That causes some of us, particularly on this
side of the house, some rather painful reflections when we compare the financial position
of the country today with its financial position less than two years ago. Two years ago,
honourable senators, this country was paying
its way. We were collecting in taxes not only
sufficient to pay out all the annual obligations
of the public service but in addition to that
the country was making substantial repayments on the national debt. Moreover, with
all that, we were slowly increasing the legislative provisions of a social character for the
benefit of the people of this country to the
extent that the then Government thought it
was possible to do so.

Compare that position of less than two years
ago with the position in which we find ourselves today when we are faced, as I say,
with a deficit in the current year of $650
million. This estimate, as I have remarked,
was made by the Minister of Finance, but
a number of reliable authorities seem to consider it to be very much on the low side.
I have heard esimates to the effect that the
real deficit for the current year will be of the
order of $1,000 million. That of course will
involve an increase in the national debt; it
will also involve the danger of inflation. I
do not need to remind honourable members
of this house of the sort of thing which inflation will bring about, if it is not checked.
But, honourable senators, this is not the
end of the story. We are faced apparently
with more capital expenditures which do not
appear in these estimates and which, I must
say, I think are to some extent at least very
questionable.
We are expected to find I don't know how
many millions for the South Saskatchewan
River dam. No one has yet succeeded in convincing me that that is an economic proposition. But quite apart from that, we are faced
with another substantial increase in the annual expenditures of this country resulting
from the announcement made recently by the
Minister of Finance with respect to the conversion of outstanding Victory bonds. He
proposes to convert approximately $6è billion
of Victory bonds maturing within the next
few years. It is true that he was faced with
the necessity of paying off Victory bonds to
an amount which, added to the further
amounts that he has to raise this year, brought
up the total of capital financing to something over $3 billion. But he has elected to

adopt a scheme under which the Victory
bonds which do not mature for several years
to come are now to be redeemed. And under
what conditions? He is offering the holders of
the present series of Victory bonds maturing
over the next few years and at present
bearing an interest rate of 3 per cent the
right to convert into a series of bonds of
different maturity dates, of which the latest
is 25 years and which bear interest at the
rate of 4ù per cent per annum. That means
that the present holders of Victory bonds
bearing interest at 3 per cent per annum,
who elect to convert them into the new longterm bonds, will have their income from that
source increased by 50 per cent without a
stroke of the pen on their part.
Looking at it from the point of view of the
budget, it is of course difficult to say just
what effect that will have upon the balance
of ways and means, but I think we can make
some calculations. This offer has been made
to the holders of $62 billion worth of Victory
bonds. I should think that the great majority
of them will take advantage of conversion
into new long-term 4ù per cent bonds. Let
us say that the holders of $4 billion worth
of the present Victory bonds elect so to convert
*into long-term bonds. That means that from
now on this country will have to pay an
extra l per cent on $4 billion, or an additional annual interest charge to the Treasury
of $60 million. Who benefits by this conversion? Of course there is a large number
of individual holders of the present Victory
bonds; but I venture to suggest that the
larger part of the bonds is held by banks,
trust companies, insurance companies and investment companies, and I see no reason why
they should receive this completely unexpected benefit at the hands of the Dominion
of Canada.
More than that: not only is this 4 per
cent, in my opinion, too high a rate for the
Dominion of Canada to pay on its own bonds,
but to my mind the most deplorable feature
of this offer is that these new bonds are by
their terms non-callable. That means that
the Government will not be able to redeem
them during the whole period for which they
are to be issued, so that for 25 years the
dominion Government will be forced to pay
4ù per cent on whatever enormous amount of
these bonds is issued in place of the Victory
bonds from which they are converted.
I have had some small experience-as I
am sure other honourable senators have-of
corporate finance, and my opinion is that it
is an extremely dangerous thing for any
corporation to issue long-term securities which
it cannot redeem, because that means that for
the whole period until the bonds mature it
is "stuck" with the interest it has undertaken
to pay. That precisely is what the Minister of

AUGUST 7, 1958
Hon. Mr. Power: I will do my own arithmetic, but there is something that seems to
be very extraordinary. Al the members
on this side of the bouse must have the same
lack of education as I have, because they
all seem to agree with my figures here.
Hon. Calvert C. Pratt: I think there is a
lot of value in the point brought out by the
honourable senator from Inkerman (Hon.
Mr. Hugessen), and perhaps indeed the
Government is going too far into the future
with the higher rates. It must not be forgotten that these new issues are to take the
place now of 3 per cent bonds which will
be maturing in period after period, the first
one coming very soon.
When will the dominion Government be
able to go into the market and borrow at
the old rates? Perhaps not again, but no
one can tell at this time. First of all, it bas
to redeem the bonds as they mature. At
what rate it will be able to borrow in five,
ten or fifteen years' time, no one can say
now. It is purely a matter of judgment.
We do know the public would not be satisfied to invest in 3 per cent securities at this
time. There is no doubt about that. So the
case is not as simple as it looks when we
say that the present policy is going to cost
so much a year extra for all those years. As
the outstanding loans mature, undoubtedly
there will be some great variation in the
rates of interest beyond the 3 per cent, which
is the rate of the present maturities.
Hon. John T. Haig: I think that my honourable friend from Gulf (Hon. Mr. Power) bas
missed one point. We are not able to sell
bonds at 3 per cent now at all. The late
Government was selling dominion bonds at
more than 3 per cent. It was selling them
at 3a per cent, and it guaranteed payment
at face value on presentation.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Those were Canada Savings
bonds.
Hon. Mr. Haig: They are similar to Victory
bonds and are exactly the same kind of
security. The only difference is that you can
take a Canada Savings bond into the bank
at any time and get your money.
The honourable senator from St. John's
West (Hon. Mr. Pratt) spoke of the interest
rate on Government bonds. That is the crux
of the argument. The Victory bonds will
mature in 1959, 1962, 1964 and 1966-a great
many of them in 1966. What rate of interest
will the Government have to pay then? We
shall have to face a market that has always
been difficult. The United States will be borrowing money like everything. At present
Canada is borrowing money freely because we
have become accustomed to extravagant ways

of living. The Government is spending extravagantly; and of course the previous Government was doing the same thing. The cost
of living index has gone up from 100 to 186
since I came to this house, and it has jumped
up more than 100 per cent since many
senators first came here. I am persuaded that
time will show the conversion deal was a
good one from the standpoint of the Government, because in order to carry on its undertakings this country must do its financing in
the same way as the other countries of the
world are doing.
In the past we have bought far too much
from and sold too little to the United States.
That picture has changed some in the past
six months. I recall the senior senator from
Ottawa (Hon. Mr. Lambert) saying to me in
this house, "Well, it shows that the Government is doing fine-we can buy more from
the United States than we have to sell to
them". But the debt was climbing all the
time. As to the present Government, some
people are judging it before it is half-way
through the course. Let us finish the course.
There is lots of time. There will not be an
election for four years, and in the meantime
the members of the Opposition will have lots
of time to criticize the Government. Honourable gentlemen opposite forget that there was
an election in June 1957. When Parliament
assembled last fall it was said that the election result was just a spasmodic action by the
people and it would not happen again, that
when the people woke up and came to their
senses those "Conservative rascals" would
be kicked out. But in this spring's election
those "Conservative rascals" came back with
the largest majority that Canada has ever
known.
Hon. Mr. Euler: You are not in a campaign
right now, are you?
Hon. Mr. Haig: They did it in Ontario,
Quebec, and the Maritime provinces. We
haven't any Liberals at all in Manitoba; they
have all moved out and we are all Conservatives there. The same is true in Saskatchewan,
except that there they had a C.C.F. member
who "got away with murder".
Hon. Mr. Euler: Honourable senators, I rise
on a point of order. The honourable gentleman is not addressing himself to the subject
at all.
Hon. Mr. Haig: It is a budget debate.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Oh, no.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Yes, it is; we are talking on
the budget.
The Hon. the Speaker: Will the honourable
gentleman kindly confine his remarks to the
subject under discussion?

SENATE
Hon. Mr. Haig: I am glad somebody stopped
me, because I was just coming to the Maritime provinces.
Honourable senators, during the 22 years
that our party sat in opposition it always
amused me that the party in power at that
time looked upon the honourable senator
form Rosetown (Hon. Mr. Aseltine) the honourable senator from Blaine Lake (Hon. Mr.
Horner) and myself the senator from Winnipeg, as the last of the Mohicans. Now, after
that long period in opposition we are on the
Government side, and I would like to say
to the member from Inkerman (Hon. Mr.
Hugessen) that he is making the same mistake that others are making in judging what
the Government has done before it is half
way along the road. Let us study the situation: he has at least four long years ahead
of him in which to do that. I do not know
how long the term will be, but I do know
that the 22 years was a long, long time.
I agree with the honourable senator from
St. John's West that this bond conversion is
a question of financial arrangement. Can anyone tell us why the stock market is so high
just now and yet corporate earnings are
lower? Nobody can answer that question. I
know that I cannot answer it. The bond
market also has made a recovery and 3 per
cent bonds are now selling at par. Those are
the things that we face. After my honourable friends opposite have been in opposition
for 22 years perhaps they will not be so sure
that their prophecies were correct. They
think they will be back in power after four
years. Well, we thought that we might have
got back into power after maybe 10 years
but we did not.
The bond conversion will be all fixed up
and settled this fall. At that time we shall
know what it is costing, and next winter we
shall be able to discuss the cost and everything else that needs to be discussed concerning the matter. Then we shall have the
actual figures and know exactly how many of
the 25-year bonds were sold and how many
of the 14-year bonds.
I think the honourable senator from Inkerman is wrong in his estimate of sales of the
25-year bonds. Personally, I think be bas
overestimated the proportion of long-term
bonds that will be taken up. Financial men
to whom I have spoken seem to think that
more 14-year bonds will be sold than any
others.
My honourable friend from Waterloo (Hon.
Mr. Euler) brought up the question of the
armed forces. Well, I will not discuss that
with anybody. I admit I am not qualified to
do so. I know that we have been spending
on defence billions of dollars every year, and
a lot of the money has been wasted because

new inventions put existing tools and equipment out of date very quickly. But what has
happened in the past may happen again. ln
the last war a certain young man used to
take over the wheel of a big fiying machine
and pull down a lighted runway at 11 o'clock
at night, with his target in enemy territory.
When asked by his dad, "What did you think
about, son, while you were up there?", he
said,"Well, I knew that you and mother were
safe." His father asked him, "Why do you
say that?" He replied, "Well, I knew that I
would probably kill 10 or 12 dads and mothers
before I got back that night and it made me
think." It may happen again that young men
will have similar duties to perform. If it
does we will be ready. We will not permit a
challenge of any kind to prevent us from
being prepared for war, if it comes to that.
That is the way I feel about it. I know that
we are net qualified to judge on these defence
matters. Our military men are as loyal as we
are and they will see to it that our forces are
provided with the best possible instruments.
Surely the United States, Great Britain,
France and our other national allies are as
anxious as we are to be qualified to do the
best that can be done. We want to hold up
our end. Europe, of course, must depend on
Great Britain and France and the United
States to carry it through, but we can do a
little, and what we are doing at the present
time is an encouragement to other nations to
do likewise.
Hon. Cyrille Vaillancouri: Honourable senators, I have a few remarks to make in connection with this $69 billion Victory bond
conversion program. A person holding any
of the various issues of Canada Savings bonds
may at any time turn them in for their full
face value. However, no individual may
hold these bonds in an amount exceeding
$10,000. Formerly the limit was $5,000. The
savings bonds are sold only to individuals,
no bank or trust company can buy them. This
new conversion of $62 billion worth of bonds
is being specially manipulated by the big
organizations, and our organization is in that
field.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: How do you know that?
Who told you?
Hon. Mr. Vaillancouri: Well, I am the
manager of a federation of caisse populaires.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: That statement is a
guess on your part.
Hon. Mr. Vaillancouri: In my organization
we help our Government in that regard because this has to do with the financing of
the country.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Are you speaking of
your own company?

AUGUST 7, 1958
Hon. Mr. Vaillancouri: It is not a company; it is a co-operative.
It bas been mentioned that the interest
rate has been increased from 3 to 4½ per cent.
Furthermore, the Government is paying a
bonus on every bond exchanged; that bonus,
in some cases, amounts to $15 or $17 per
thousand dollars. The amount of the bonus,
plus the increased interest rate, will raise the
figure mentioned by my honourable friend
from Gulf (Hon. Mr. Power).
Hon. Arthur W. Roebuck: Honourable senators, I think something should be said in
defence of our colleague from Waterloo (Hon.
Mr. Euler). He was not talking so much
about the extravagance of our defence as he
was advocating that we take the proper steps
toward making that expenditure unnecessary,
both on the part of ourselves and our assumed
enemies. I see no reason why he should be
criticized for that. Of all things in the world,
a quarrel is the sort of thing that should be
stopped as soon as possible. I have never
thought it proper to vote against military
estimates, but at the same time I do hope
the time will come, and that in the not too
distant future, when military expenditures
will no longer be necessary.
Hon. Mr. Bruni: We al hope that.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Agreed.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Everybody agrees with
me on that, so why criticize the senator from
Waterloo?
I rose not so much to take part in the
debate as to ask a question. I would like to
know from the honourable sponsor of this
bill how much we are paying to the brokers
for the job of increasing the interest rate
from 3 to 4j per cent. That is information
which my honourable friends across the aisle
will have at their fingers' end. I read in a
newspaper-I don't know if there is any truth
in it-that a convention of considerable
magnitude was held with these financial men
prior to the issue of the new bonds and that
some deal was made with the Department of
Finance with regard to the payment which
they would receive for their services. An
item appeared in the press-whether it was
informed or not, I don't know-that it is
costing something like $25 million just for
commissions and underwriting charges of
these bonds. Is that a fact?

will be paid on the conversion of any of these
bonds. In addition, there is a list containing
approximately 2,500 names-what is called a
special names list-consisting of companies,
estates and a few individuals who are large
holders of these bonds. The regular commission is not paid on any of their holdings.
I understand that the commission on longtern bonds is one per cent, and that the
rate goes down as the maturity closes up:
on the really short-term bonds it is, I believe,
a quarter of one per cent. The estimate
which the honourable senator from TorontoTrinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck) has given, of $25
million, is, as far as I can gather, approximately correct, but we shall not know until
conversion is completed, because if large
numbers of bonds are converted into the
long-term issue the commission, naturally,
will be higher, but if everyone who is entitled
to do so converts into the short-term issues
the commission will of course be smaller.
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: Is the cost of advertising included in the $25 million?
Hon. Mr. Bruni: My understanding is that
it is not included.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: This has to do with
commissions?
Hon. Mr. Bruni: Yes, as I understand it.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: I might point out to
the honourable senator from Toronto-Trinity that on the Order Paper there is a
question on the same point in the name of
the honourable senator from De la Durantaye
(Hon. Mr. Pouliot). I have asked for the information he requires, and I assume it will
be presented at the next sitting of the
Senate.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: For how long will the
brokers be working on this?
Hon. Mr. Bruni: I understand that the
closing date is September 16.
Hon. Mr. Vaillancouri: September 15.
Hon. Mr. Bruni: Yes.
Hon. Mr. Power: At the risk of being
considered a nuisance, may I ask how this
control over the 2,500 special names will be
exercised?

Hon. Mr. Bruni: I may be wrong, but I
Hon. Mr. Bruni: Honourable senators, I
can answer that question in part. I cannot understand that the list was prepared by

CANADIAN FARM LOAN BILL
THIRD READING
Hon. W. M. Aselline moved the third reading of Bill C-38, to amend the Canadian
Farm Loan Act.
Hon. William M. Wall: Honourable senators, it is not my intention to delay the
third reading of this bill, but I had hoped
that either the Leader of the Government
(Hon. Mr. Aseltine) or one of the Government
spokesmen would make some sort of statement on third reading in response to the
observations which were made and to the
questions asked in this .chamber concerning
certain improvements or amendments to the
act to meet more adequately some of the
problem areas which were indicated on
second reading. I would not wish to draw
incorrect inferences from the fact that these
observations were not answered by the
Government in the house here or during the
committee proceedings, which I followed with
great interest.
For example, the honourable senator from
Milford-Hants (Hon. Mr. Hawkins), if I understood his remarks correctly, stressed the
problem area of the relationship between the
Nova Scotia Land Settlement Board, the
provincial credit institution for agriculture,
and the Canadian Farm Loan Board. He
spoke at length about that problem and he
made some observations concerning the
problem of consultative and supervisory
services to agricultural borrowers both at the
time of negotiating for loans and later during
the course of repayment. I had hoped that
probably some indication would come from
the Government as to its attitude, either now
or in the immediate future, concerning this
problem.
I wish to bring to the attention of honourable senators what the honourable senator
from Westmorland (Hon. Mr. Taylor) said
the other day. I note that he is not present
in the chamber at the moment. The honourable gentleman raised three very interesting
problem areas, and he is a man of experience,
for if I remember correctly he spent some 17
years administering the Farm Settlement Act in
New Brunswick. He pointed out these problem
areas: first, that a partnership or a private
corporation could not secure a loan above the
amount that was granted to an individual,
and that this was a problem area which is
of serious proportions at the present time;
57075-4-31

secondly, that according to the present regulations the valuation placed on a property on
which the appraised value is obtained is
based on cultivated farm lands and buildings
only, and that this creates a very serious
problem in eastern Canada because woodlots
are not included in the appraised value before
loans are granted.
The honourable senator pointed out also
that the present Farm Loan Board Act almost
precludes a young farmer from getting a
loan. Let us suppose there is a young farmer
who wants to buy a farm. Unless he already
owns a farm he cannot get a loan, and the
Farm Loan Board as such has no authority
to buy a farm and then sell it to this individual. Hence there is a problem area for
the young farmer who has no land, wants to
start operating a farm, and maybe has $5,000,
$6,000 or $10,000 to begin with. If he bas no
land, no holding, I understand he cannot get
a loan.
I also pointed out during my brief intervention that I hoped I might see in this
legislation the kind of amendments that were
stressed-that were advanced as logical legitimate, and necessary-by the present spokesmen of the Government back in 1956. I
mentioned that the two points that were
raised at the time-and as a matter of fact
I agree with them-as necessary, sequential
amendments to meet the kind of farm credit
needs that were becoming more acute were:
(a) changing the percentage relationship of
appraised value to 75 from 65, which was
the proposition, if I may now mention it,
advanced by the honourable senator from
Hastings-Frontenac (Hon. Mr. White); and
(b) that the amount of the loan be raised from
$15,000 to $20,000.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: May I ask the honourable senator a question? Is there anything
in the act or in the regulations which makes
it impossible for a proposed purchaser to accept an offer of sale or to make an offer
to purchase subject to the obtaining
of a loan of a stated amount from the board?
Hon. Mr. Wall: I must confess that I cannot answer that question, but it was a question that was raised by the honourable senator from Westmorland and it was not
answered in committee. I am just raising it or
indicating it as a problem area that appears
to exist and was not taken care of in the
simple amendment to the bill which merely
increases the board's capitalization.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Perhaps we will hear
from the Government on that particular point.
Hon. Mr. Wall: I am hoping that will be so.
Quite frankly, I was tempted even at this
late stage to move arnendments to this bill

SENATE
by adding clause 2 which in effect would
repeal section 7 of the Canadian Farm Loan
Act and change the appraisal percentage to
75 and the maximum loan to $20,000. But I
have a suspicion that such amendments could
be construed or interpreted as being beyond
the competency of the Senate, because although they are of a permissive character
in their intent, if carried out by the board
they could at least potentially increase, not
the over-all charge on the exchequer which
is delineated by clause 1 of the bill and is
Government-recommended and is a Government commitment, but the rate of the charges
on the exchequer in the form of loans. I am
therefore, not pressing my amendments at
this time at all but I do hope that by saying
what I have said some form of a response to
some of the questions and some of the comments concerning the problem are as may yet
be forthcoming at this stage.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: In reply to the honourable senator, I wish to state that there is
nothing at all in the act to prevent a person
doing as was suggested by the honourable
senator from Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr.
Roebuck). A deal may be made subject to
obtaining a loan.
The other matters mentioned by the honourable junior senator from Winnipeg (Hon.
Mr. Wall) are all matters of policy and I have
drawn them to the attention of the Government. The act is constantly under process of
revision and it would be entirely improper for
this house to make any amendments such as
suggested by him, because we have no power
to do so. They would be in the nature of
taxation measures.
Hon. George S. White: Honourable senators,
I only wish to say a word in regard to the
remarks made by the honourable junior senator from Winnipeg. He is entirely mistaken
when he says that a farmer cannot obtain a
loan not become effective only on the closing
I know I am correct in that, because at the
present time two applications have been made
through myself by a farmer to buy a farm.

think when the results of that study come
forward many of the suggestions and criticisms of the present act will be rectified.
Hon. Mr. Wall: May I say that I am fully
aware of the statement made by the honourable minister, and I made reference to it
when I spoke previously in the house.
I would like to add that it would no doubt
be of great interest to some of us in this house
if we could have a study that has evidently
been prepared by Dr. Booth of the Economics
Division of the Department of Agriculture, in
which he tries to give some picture of the
provincial-federal legislation dealing with
farm credit, plus the experiences of some
other countries. If it were possible to have
that document tabled in this house, I would
be very happy to study it.
Motion agreed to and bill read third time
and passed.
PRIVATE BILL
WESTCOAST TRANSMISSION COMPANY
LIMITED-SECOND READING

Hon. William R. Bruni moved the second
reading of Bill S-16, respecting Westcoast
Transmission Company Limited.
He said: Honourable senators, Bill S-16, entitled "An Act respecting Westcoast Transmission Company Limited", is a simple
bill and one which requires only a short
explanation.
The purpose of the bill is twofold: first, to
allow the company to increase the number of
its directors so as to make possible a wider
representation of shareholders on the board
of directors; and secondly, to give the company the right it desires to have, to set up
an executive committee consisting of not less
than three directors, so that the day-to-day
operations of the company may be carried
on and the problems dealt with in an efficient
and expeditious manner.
To deal with the bill clause by clause:
Clause 1 of the bill repeals section 8 of
Chapter 37, Statutes of 1949 (First Session),
being the act under which this company was
incorporated. In place of section 8,
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: May I ask, would the originally
the following is substituted:
loan not become effective only on the closing
Sections 153, 162, 167, 184, 190, 193 and 194 of
of the deal?
Part III of the Companies Act shall not be
incorporated with this act.
Hon. Mr. White: That is correct.
I may state that the only addition which is
In reply to the other matters raised by the
honourable senator I would refer him to page made by this particular clause is the adding
2297 of the House of Commons Hansard, of section 153 of the dominion Companies Act,
where he will find a statement by the Minis- which reads as follows:
The affairs of the company shall be managed by
ter of Finance to the effect that the Canadian

Act and the Veterans' Land Act are all under
Honourable senators will note that under
extensive study at the present time, with the
improve- this particular section of the Companies Act
hope and expectation of making
ments to the Canadian Farm Loan Act. I the number of directors of any company

AUGUST 7, 1958
must be at least three and in no case more
than nine. By inserting section 153 of the
Companies Act in clause 1 of this bill it
means that this particular section does not
apply to Westcoast Transmission Company
Limited, and that the restriction with respect
to directors has no application to this
company.
In view of this, it is then necessary that
the number of persons who shall serve as
directors of this company be fixed, and this
is done by clause 2 of the bill.
Honourable senators will note that, by
clause 2 of the bill, this company must have
at least three directors, and also the company can have as many as 15 directors, the
number being fixed from time to time by
bylaw of the company.
Finally, clause 3 deals with the setting up
of an executive committee to operate and
manage the company from day to day.
I might point out that clause 3 is actually
section 94 of the present Companies Act,
word for word; and under this particular
clause the company, whenever the board of
directors consists of more than six, can set
up an executive committee of not less than
three. Further, such executive committee
shall have the power to fix its quorum at not
less than a majority of its members.
Finally, this committee may exercise such
powers of the board as are delegated to it
from time to time by bylaw, subject of course
to any restriction as contained in any such
bylaw and to any regulations imposed from
time to time by the directors.
That is all I have to say in connection
with the bill. I shall be pleased to answer
any questions.
It is my purpose, of course, to move that
the bill be referred to the appropriate
committee.
Motion agreed to and bill read a second
time.

Hon. Mr. Roebuck: May I ask when this
bill will be distributed? It is not on our desks

Hon. Mr. Aselline: I have received my copy.
The bill will be distributed by tomorrow,
I am sure.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Yes, but that is not good
enough. Will it be distributed tonight?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Is it the intention of
the honourable leader to proceed with this
bill as the first item of business tomorrow?
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: That is the intention, yes.
After second reading it will be referred to
the Banking and Commerce Committee and
it may be some time before it is through
there. I would like on that account to proceed
with second reading tomorrow.
The Hon. the Speaker: Can the bill be distributed tonight?
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: It will be distributed
first thing in the morning.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Will it be distributed

OF COMMITTEE

ADOPTED

Hon. Arthur W. Roebuck, Chairman of the
Standing Committee on Divorce, presented
the committee's reports Nos. 308 to 330.
He said: Honourable senators, I hope to
present on Thursday the committee's final
report for this session. It is now being prepared. Honourable senators will notice that
the reports have reached 330 in number. That
does not mean 330 cases have been tried, for
certain reports have recommended refund of
parliamentary fees, the granting of certain
powers to the committee, and so on. I shall
give complete statistics later, but I may say
now that the actual number of cases tried
was 319.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators,
when shall these reports be taken into
consideration?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Honourable senators,
I move, with leave, that these reports be
adopted now.
Motion agreed to.
CENTRAL MORTGAGE BANK
NOTICE OF FURTHER

INQUIRY

Hon. Jean-François Poulio±: Honourable
senators, as a rule the honourable Leader of
the Government (Hon. Mr. Aseltine) is quite
accurate and helpful in answering questions
of my honourable colleagues. But at page
480 of Senate Hansard, in dealing with the
second part of my question about the Central
Mortgage Bank Act, he did not answer as
well as usual. I have to make inquiries
myself to verify his answer.
The question I asked was this:
Did the said act go into effect and, if not, why?

The answer was "Yes". It may be "Yes"
if one overlooks the fact that the Board of
Directors of the bank was never authorized
to act. I will refer the honourable gentleman to some important clippings. I knew
that the Central Mortgage Bank directors
had been named. On July 12, 1939, in the
Montreal Gazette, there was a dispatch from
that paper's resident correspondent in Ottawa
stating that the act was going into effect
the following Friday, and there were many
difficulties. In the Ottawa Journal of July
17, 1939 there was an article headed: "What
Knotty problem for bank".
is a farm?
There was no definition of the word "farm"
in the Bank Act. And on August 22 the
Central Mortgage Bank was supposed to
begin enrolling loan companies within six
weeks.

AUGUST 12, 1958
Then in the papers of October 7, 1939 there
was a Canadian Press dispatch with the following headline, "Mortgage aids may be
halted", with subheadings reading: "Government ponders whether Central Bank plan
now needed", and "War conditions alter outlook on scheme to discount obligations". The
answer is found not in the Senate Hansard
but in the Budget Speech of the Minister of
Finance on June 24, 1940, at page 1055 of
the House of Commons Hansard:
The Government purchased capital stock of the
Central Mortgage Bank to the amount of $250,000.
On November 13, 1939, it was announced that the
Government had decided that the Central Mortgage
Bank should not commence active operations for
the time being. The existing state of war and the
uncertainties regarding the effect which war might
have on incomes and real estate values, made conditions so abnormal that the Government did not
feel it would be practicable to make, with any
degree of assurance, valuations that would provide
an equitable and permanent basis for sound debtorcreditor relationships. There was the further consideration that the adjustments contemplated by the
act involved the use of the national credit on a
substantial scale, and this also seemed undesirable
in view of the very heavy present and prospective
demands upon the national resources for war
purposes.

What happened was that the gentleman
who was appointed as general manager of
the bank was in charge of a skeleton staff
for many pears, until the Central Mortgage
Corporation replaced the skeleton staff of
the Central Mortgage Bank and the manager
of the Central Mortgage Bank became the
manager of the Central Mortgage Corporation.
Now I have a practical question to ask,
referring to what the honourable senator
from Hanover (Hon. Mr. Brunt) said not
long ago about the trust and loan companies.
He said there was a request from the trust
and loan companies for the public legislation that has recently been before the Senate.
He did not say what were the reasons alleged
by those companies to have that legislationHon. Mr. Aseltine: I think the honourable
senator is completely out of order in discussing all these matters, and that he should
put another question on the Order Paper.
The Hon. the Speaker: He has put a question and he is explaining it. I think he may
proceed.
Hon. Mr. Pouliot: Thank you, sir. I do not
want to take up too much of the time of the
Senate, but I had to work hard to answer
my own question to my own satisfaction,
and I am giving my honourable colleagues
the benefit of my research. But now I come
to my question, which is clear, and which I
will try to make as concise as possible. The
Central Mortgage Bank Bill was the ancestor
of the Central Mortgage Corporation. I cannot find this in the books that I have at my

disposal, but what I want to know is if the
trust and loan companies that insisted on the
passing of the Central Mortgage Bank Bill
in 1939 were the same companies that insisted
on having the recent legislation about trust
and loan companies.
Hon. Mr. Horner: May I point out to your
Honour that, much as I enjoy listening to
the honourable senator, I fail to see what
bearing his remarks have upon a question of
notice of motion.
The Hon. the Speaker: The honourable
senator is speaking on a notice of inquiry.
Hon. Mr. Pouliot: Yes.
Hon. Mr. Horner: I think he is entirely out
of order.
The Hon. the Speaker: I rule that the honourable senator is in order, but that since he
is speaking on a notice of inquiry his remarks
should be brief.
Hon. Mr. Pouliot: Thank you. For the benefit of the honourable gentleman, I will state
my question and then he will not be put to
the trouble of reading it in the Order Paper.
It is to save his time that I am putting that
question now, but I want to be clear, because
if I had not a satisfactory answer in the first
place it was perhaps because my question was
not clear enough. I enjoy having an interruption from the honourable gentleman from
Blaine Lake (Hon. Mr. Horner), because he
gives me an opportunity to complete my question. If he had not spoken I could not have
given all those explanations to tell this honourable chamber what I want to know. But
now probably he will agree with me, as we
agreed together in the most famous debate
which took place in the Senate in years. We
.two alone held the same view, and it was the
first time opposites met in such unison.
But now, here is my question, clearer than
ever-crystal clear: I want to know if the
trust and loan companies which insisted on
the passing of the Central Mortgage Bank
bill in 1939 were the same companies that
insisted, according to the evidence of the honourable senator from Hanover (Hon. Mr.
Brunt), on the passing of the amendments to
the Trust and Loan Companies Bills this year,
and, if so, what reasons did they give in each
instance, and who were those who wrote on
behalf of those companies in 1939 and every
other year, according to our honourable
friend? That is my question. I hope that the
honourable gentleman from Blaine Lake finds
it clear enough, and that the answer will be
just as clear and as concise as my question is.

SENATE
STRATFORD SHAKESPEAREAN
FESTIVAL
ENGAGEMENT OF LANGSTON HUGHESINQUIRY AND ANSWER
Hon. Jean-Francois Pouliot inquired of the
Government, pursuant to notice:
Referring to the remarks of the Honourable
Senator Quinn about the engagement of Langston
Hughes at the Stratford Festival, as reported in the
Senate Hansard of July 15 and 16, 19581. Did the Stratford Festival authorities notify the
Government that they had cancelled Langston

Hughes' engagement?
2. Did the Government get any reaction from the
Canada Council?
3. If so, what was it?

Hon. W. M. Aseltine: Honourable senators,
the answer to the honourable gentleman's
inquiry is as follows:
1. No.
2. No.
3. Answered by No. 2.
CANADA CONVERSION LOAN
INQUIRY AND ANSWER

Hon. Mr. Pouliot inquired of the Government, pursuant to notice:
1. What commission has been allowed by the
Government of Canada for the sale of Canada Conversion Loan 1958?
2. Was it uniform?
3. If not, what was it and why were the commissions granted on a different percentage?
4. What is the total amount of the commissions
granted by the Government for the said loan?

Hon. Mr. Aseltine: I have the following answer to the honourable gentleman's inquiry:

1. Commission: 3 per cent 31 year bonds,
¼ of 1 per cent; 32 per cent 7 year bonds,
à of 1 per cent; 41 per cent 14 year bonds, 3 of
1 per cent; 41 per cent 25 year bonds, 1 per
cent.

No sales commission is payable in respect
of bonds converted by the Bank of Canada,
government accounts or chartered banks for

their head office portfolios. Moreover, there is
a list of about 2,500 names including all the
large corporate investors in Canada who are
being covered on a co-operative basis by the
investment dealers under the direction of a
national

committee. In

the case

of

conver-

sions by these corporate investors, the rate of
commission is one quarter of one per cent
on the three and one-quarter year 3 per cent
bond, and one half of one per cent on all

other maturities.
2. No.
3. It has been customary for many years
on new financing of the Government of
Canada, of provinces and of corporations to
establish selling commissions at rates varying
directly with the period of time for which
money is borrowed. Shorter-term issues tend
to be distributed among fewer investors and

in larger average transactions than longer
term issues of comparable size. The Conversion Loan of 1958 has been designed to produce a significant lengthening in the average
term of the funded debt and the commission
scale provides incentives which support this
objective.
4. Since there is no way of determining the
total amount of conversions which will be
made into each of the four maturities, it is
not possible to indicate what the total commissions will be.
CIVIL RIGHTS
INQUIRY AND ANSWER

Hon. Mr. Aselline: Honourable senators, I
have a reply to a question which was asked
on August 5 by the honourable junior senator
from Winnipeg (Hon. Mr. Wall). He referred
to the legislation concerning a Bill of Rights
and mentioned a statement made by the Prime
Minister in 1955 having to do with the setting
up of a joint committee of both houses to act
as a watchdog over civil rights. He then asked
if it was the intention of the Government
to set up such a joint committee before proceeding with the introduction of the Bill of
Rights.
The answer to that question is: No.
Both houses would have to be consulted.
However, the idea is still considered good and
has not been given up.
NATIONAL PAROLE BOARD
INQUIRY AND ANSWER

Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Honourable senators, I
also have a reply to a question asked last
Tuesday by the honourable Leader of the
Opposition (Hon. Mr. Macdonald). He stated
that in the press the other day he saw a
dispatch to the effect that the Minister of
Justice intends to call a meeting with provincial representatives to discuss the Fauteux
Committee report. He also stated that be had
noted on the Orders of the Day of the House
of Commons that the Minister of Justice has
a resolution to the effect that it is expedient
to introduce a measure to establish a National
Parole Board.
He asked if the Leader of the Government
could inform the Senate whether it is the
intention of the Minister of Justice to proceed
with the resolution during this session and
before the meeting above mentioned.
The answer to that question is that the Government is proceeding with the parole bill.
The explanation of the fact that we are proceeding with the parole bill before the meeting with the provincial ministers to discuss
the Fauteux Committee report is that the
Fauteux Committee report makes certain

my opinion they have a right to have a chance
to do what they are doing well.
The railways in Canada face fierce competition from water and highway transportation. Highway transport bas increased greatly,
and it is increasing all the time. The trouble
with that form of competition is that the
costs of the roads are not paid for by the
people who use them most. The citizens of
Canada pay for the roads, and yet the truckers
get the greater use of them, with just the
payment of a license fee and perhaps a
little extra tax on gasoline.
Hon. Mr. Bruni: The truckers would give
you an argument on that point.
Hon. Mr. Haig: We have to do something
to put the C.N.R. on a fair basis of competition with other forms of transportation.
When the railways go before the Board of
Transport Commissioners, it is always the
C.P.R. that is taken as the yardstick, and
what is given to the C.P.R., the C.N.R. bas
to accept. At the same time we put on to
the Canadian National Railways system railway after railway and ask it to pay the
charges on these roads that cannot physically
be made to pay. No man in his right senses
would ever think of buying this railway
system as a business proposition. So, for
these reasons, I say that we as Canadians
have to recognize the need for doing something that will solve the problem, rather
than have the system come to Parliament
for a vote of moneys every year. This year
they are asking for $307 million.
This situation is one that demands our
attention. I do not know of any body better
qualified to consider a subject like this than
the Senate. We have in this chamber men
and women from every part of Canada; we
are all interested in our country, and in giving the railway that is owned by the people
of Canada an even chance with other systems
of transportation. I am opposed to handicapping the men and women who work for the
C.N.R., and putting them in a position where
they cannot possibly make a success of their
railway operation in the same way as does
the C.P.R.
The bill now before us is the usual bill
that comes before Parliament each session.
By it Parliament is asked to vote so much
money for the year 1958, and an estimated
amount for the first six months of 1959. That
is the way it has always been done. In a
private company you would have to have the
money from the beginning of the year to
make the expenditures and pay for improvements; but with the public-owned railway
the money has to be provided in advance by
Parliament. After taking into consideration
the costs and expenditures for the year 1958,

an estimate is made on that basis for the
expenditures of the first six months of 1959.
The bill further provides that the Government guarantee the bonds issued by the
railway system, or the company can borrow
the money straight from the Government
and give a guarantee for it.
In order that honourable senators may
have a little clearer picture of what takes
place-and I must say I haven't got enough
brains to follow it in every detail-I have
had prepared certain statements which put
the picture in a general way and also in
certain details. With the permission of the
house I should like to place this information
in Hansard. In that way, when we come to
consider this matter tomorrow or at any
other time we will have these facts before
uS.
The first statement, in general, shows the
expenditures for various items in 1958, of
$330 million-odd, less $28 million for uncompleted work, and less depreciation of $85
million, making a net figure of $127 millionodd. The statement also shows the estimated
expenditure for the first half of 1959 of $134
million, less certain other items amounting
to $44 million, leaving a net total of $90
million, and a grand total of $307 millionodd.

These tables explain how the total sum is
arrived at. Most of the money is borrowed
from the public on the guarantee of the
Government. Sometimes, when the expenditure is greater than expected and the Government has approved it, the Government
itself makes the loan and takes security.
One other matter which I have not covered,
and as to which there may be some disagreement, is that the Government has decided to
appoint as auditor not George A. Touche and
Co., who have had the contract for some years,
but the head of another firm which is quite
well known in Montreal, a gentleman who is

take this-perhaps I am to blame that this
was not down three or four days earlier.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Whatever you say
will be held in evidence against you!
Hon. Mr. Haig: But the honourable Leader
of the Government (Hon. Mr. Aseltine) is not
to blame.
I heard in the corridors of the House of
Commons that there was going to be a long
debate on unionism in connection with this
bill and I said "We will never get the bill by
tomorrow." However, about half-past three
the next afternoon the leader of my party
came to me and said, "Your bill will be over
here in haIf an hour", and I replied, "I'm
not ready to go on." I admit I was not ready,
but I had all this detail in mind. That is why
I had to wait until tonight to move second
reading and explain the bill. In the meantime we have promised the C.N.R. officials
that if it is at all possible the bill will be
assented to tomorrow afternoon. That is why
we want the bill to be given second reading
tonight.
Hon. W. Rcss Macdonald: Honourable
senators,-

Hon. R. B. Horner: Honourable senators,
perhaps I can go ahead of my honourable
friendHon. Mr. Macdonald: I always give way to
the honourable gentleman fron Blaine Lake
(Hon. Mr. Horner).
Hon. Mr. Horner: Thank you. Honourable
senators, perhaps the selection of the man to
introduce this bill was an unfortunate one,
for I understand he has received special
favours as a guest of the Chateau Laurier.
He mentioned these seconds in command and
how capable they are. I would like to know
from him if he does not think they should
be placed at the head of the railroad. On an
earlier occasion I attempted to introduce a
bill in this house and the honourable senior
senator from Winnipeg (Hon. Mr. Haig) was
not very kind to me, so I don't feel under
any obligation to be particularly kind to him.
I repeat, his selection was an unfortunate one,
for I happen to know he receives special
favours from the Canadian National Railways
as a guest of the Chateau Laurier Hotel.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Who is that?
Hon. Mr. Haig: Tell them about it.
Hon. Mr. Horner: This legislation affects me
in the freight rates I pay, and I want to
know if he does not think these very capable
men from Winnipeg, who are seconds in command, should be placed at the head of the
railway system.

Hon. Mr. Haig: Let me explain. The
"favours" I received at the Chateau Laurier
amounted to this. When Prime Minister
Diefenbaker held a reception in the Chateau
Laurier for the Queen of Canada the manager
of the hotel found me at the end of a line
of 600 guests who were waiting to be presented to Her Majesty, and he took me
through a back room and placed me fourth
in the line. The result was that I was the
fourth member of either house of Parliament
to be presented. That was the favour. I certainly could not have stood up while 600
people had been presented ahead of me. It
did not mean anything in a monetary sense.
I have been living in the Chateau Laurier
Hotel for a long time, 23 years, and I have
always paid the regular rates and I am still
paying them.
Hon. Mr. Euler: That is nothing.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Fortunately, I have been
able to pay them. I take sorme of my meals
n the Chatcau Laurier, but I think they are

Rost of my meals

n the Pariianentary Restaurant. At any
rate, that is not what I was talking about.
It may be that Mr. Gordon is not a clever
railroad man, but lie is certainly known to
the public as a good businessman. He was
employed as one who gave us great service
during the war. I know whereof I speak,
and no matter what you say about the other
young men I know they are A-1. That is the
only reason I wanted to speak on their behalf,
just the same as I would speak for the sons
of the honourable senator from Blaine Lake
(Hon. Mr. Horner) if they were here. My
honourable friend has two fine young men
in the House of Commons.
Hon. Mr. Horner: Never mind about that.
Hon. Mr. Haig: But I don't think he would
suggest that he should get out of here to let
them take his place.
Hon. Mr. Horner: That is not the argument.
Hon. Mr. Haig: They are very able young
men; of course I am not suggesting the
honourable senator is not an able man.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Does my friend from Winnipeg (Hon. Mr. Haig) suggest that these two
exceptionally able young men are being held
back by their senior?
Hon. Mr. Haig: The point is this. How can
any young man hope to become president of
a great railroad if he cannot show prosperity
in his own company because of the debt load
and other difficulties the railroad faces? I
want to get this out of the way so that these
men will have an even break with their
counterparts in other companies.

AUGUST 12, 1958
Hon. Mr. Euler: Are you suggesting they
are not getting an even break now?
Hon. Mr. Haig: No.
Hon. Mr. Euler: What is the reason they
are not getting an even break?
Hon. Mr. Haig: Because they are paying
interest on money that is not producing any
revenue.
Hon. Mr. Euler: I am referring to the two
young men who are being held back.
Hon. Mr. Haig: They are not being held
back. They are at the top.
Hon. Mr. Euler: I cannot understand the
remark at all.
Hon. W. Ross Macdonald: Honourable
senators, I have comparatively few remarks
to make. I am sure all of us have enjoyed
the debate thus far, but I intend to deal only
with some of the details of the bill.
The sponsor stated that provision is made
for an expenditure of $307 million. Well, I am
glad the bill is going to committee, for I don't
see how that figure, which is quite a sizeable
sum, is arrived at. Paragraphs (a), (b) and (c)
of section 3(1) of the bill provide respectively
for expenditures of $330,623,000, $134 million
and $110 million.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Look at the credits. Get the
credit side of the picture.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: The three items I
have mentioned total $574,623,000. According to the statement tabled by the sponsor
of the bill (Hon. Mr. Haig) there are certain
credits; but even with those credits we are
providing $574,623,000.
I will not ask the
sponsor to give us a further explanation now
but I think this point should be cleared up
in committee tomorrow.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Surely.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: As I understood my
honourable friend's explanation, the credits
are possible ones, but the liabilities might
amount to $574 million.
Now, the honourable gentleman said there
was some urgency in passing this legislation,
and he said it should have been introduced
earlier. Well, I do not know when it could
have been introduced, because I understand
the bill did not pass the House of Commons
until late Thursday afternoon. It was given
first reading in the Senate later the same
day, and unless the house had sat on Friday
or Monday the bill could not have been
given second reading before tonight.
It has been said there is great urgency in
this, that the Canadian National Railways
ran out of money on July 1, and therefore
we are asked to rush this bill through second

reading tonight, deal with it in committee
tomorrow morning and give it third reading
and pass it in the house tomorrow afternoon. Why the rush? The house has been
in session since May 12. If the Canadian
National Railways ran out of money on July
1, I would like to know how it has been
operating until now and why it can't continue to operate until August 14 or 15, which
would give us plenty of time to consider the
bill.
Honourable senators, this is another example of our being asked to rush a bill
through when there is no need to rush it.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: This bill should have
come to us a week ago.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: We have had it since
last Thursday.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I understand it was
received in this house at six o'clock last
Thursday afternoon. This is the first time
the house has met since then.
Hon. Mr. Aselfine: The bill was received
here about four o'clock last Thursday.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: All right, four o'clock.
If the Canadian National Railways ran out
of money on July 1, why did the Government
wait until August 7 to present the bill to this
house, with a request that honourable senators rush it through, because the railway
needs the money? I can see no necessity
whatsoever for rushing it. In addition the Government has taken upon itself the responsibility of calling officers of the railway to
Ottawa tomorrow morning on the assumption
that this house will give the bill second
reading tonight. Well, we may give it second
reading tonight. I am prepared to make my
speech now, for I have no reason for holding
the bill up, but I do protest against our being
asked to rush bills of this kind through this
house shortly after they are received here,
when there appears to be no urgency
whatsoever.
Honourable senators, if the bill goes to
committee I think we should get a full report on the financial condition of the Canadian National Railways. I understand that the
company lost considerable money last year
and that the prospects for next year are just
as bad. I think the honourable senior senator
from Winnipeg (Hon. Mr. Haig) went so far
as to say that the railway is going to continue
to lose money for all time to come. I do not
say this has anything to do with the bill but
I would remind him that when the former
administration was in power the railway did
not lose money every year.
Hon. Mr. Haig: It wrote off $1 billion.

SENATE
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Under the present
financial set-up it made money. Why does
the honourable senator say, just because another administration is in power, that the
railway is going to lose money for all time to
come? I think that is a pessimistic view to
take, and I hope it will not come true.
I think we should also find out, in committee, about the volume of passenger traffic
and of freight traffic which the railway is
now carrying, and if it is anticipated that
both will decrease, temporarily or continuously.
Another matter I am particularly interested
in is the pool trains, of which we have a
limited number, operated by the two large
railways. I would like to know if these pool
trains are making or losing money. I would
also like to know if second-class equipment
is used on them; that is, if the better equipment is used where there is competition
between the two railways and second-class
equipment is relegated to lines on which pool
trains are operated. Honourable senators who
have travelled from Toronto to Ottawa know
what a rough ride it is. Is that because the
equipment is second-class or, in other words,
pool-trein equipment? I arn sure honourable
senators who make that trip will bear me
out, that if one tries to sleep on the night
train it is like taking a rough sea voyage
and one gets a feeling like seasickness.

in a satisfactory manner since 1923, with the
exception of one year, should suddenly be
dismissed, and that one man, not a firm, be
appointed instead. I think we should hear
more about that change in committee.
Again, I protest against a so-called urgency
which does not exist, and I would request the
Leader of the Government (Hon. Mr. Aseltine) net to continue to bring these bills
forwardHon. Mr. Asel±ine: I have been doing my
best. I coud have asked the house to sit on

Hon. Mr. Macdonald: With all due respect
to the leader, I think every honourable senator is prepared to sit on Friday, Saturday and
Monday, if necessary. What I am asking is,
if the Canadian National Railways, according
to the statement made here this evening, ran
out of money on July 1, why is there such a
rush to give it money on August 13? The bill
could have come to us carlier if there is so
much urgency.

Hon. Jean-François Pouliot: Honourable

especially at Riviere du Loup, and at Moncton, Halifax and everywhere else, who have
given the best of their lives to the railway.
Hon. Mr. Monette: May I ask the honourable gentleman a question? Does he know
them all?
Hon. Mr. Pouliot: I know enough of them
to say there are are not only two efficient
employees. Efficient employees are numerous
throughout the railway service. I say to my
honourable friend that I do not treat that
question as a joke, because in my heart I feel
very deeply the sufferings of those men and
their families. What is the life of a railway
employee? It is a life of sacrifice and devotion both for the man who works and for
the family which is anxious about him. They
have tremendous responsibilities. What is lacking in the whole Canadian National organization is the human feeling, the human element.
I do not wish to discuss the merits of Mr.
Dingle, whom I am honoured to consider a
personal friend of mine. I have many friends
in the Canadian National Railways, but they
mostly belong to the rank and file. I served
them to the best of my ability during the
many years I had the honour to represent
them in the House of Commons. I know
their problems as well as anybody here. When
these men come to me and say, "We hope you
will say a good word on our behalf in the
Senate of Canada when the Canadian National
Railways bill comes up", I reply, "Surely I
will do that; I am not going to forget what
you have done for the country by working
as well as you have for the Canadian National
Railways." That is my stand today.
Is it possible to touch Mr. Donald Gordon?
Is it possible to make an appeal to his heart?
Who in the whole country can succeed in
doing that? When he says, "No", there is
nothing that will make him change his mind.
He is known for that. He is a czar. That is
his way of behaving toward other people. He
may be successful and he may be an able
man; I do not wish to discuss his ability.
What I do not like is that it is impossible to
discuss matters with him, and if we do try
to discuss things with him he will admit
nothing. That is what I complain of. I will
tell my honourable friends that when a man
has been working for the railway for 14 years
and several months, doing hard and unpleasant work, and sometimes dirty work, in the
carrying out of his duties, and when he has
only two or three months to go to get his
superannuation, which will ensure his security
and that of his family, and when he has
children who are still at school, and he is
told to go before getting his superannuation,
under those circumstances I regard that treatment as cruel. I do not find it a laughing

matter; I find it cruel. I find it sad and I do
not think that it could happen in any other
company.
I would like to refer to the C.P.R. and its
difficulty about the firemen on diesel locomotives. What did the management of that
company have to say? They said that their
decision to have only a locomotive engineer
in the cab on certain trains would not affect
the firemen who are at present working and
that they would be provided with other jobs.
That is human, sensible treatment. That is
really the way things should be done in this
country. I regret very much, honourable
senators, that in this I have to make a comparison that is more favourable to the Canadian Pacific Railway than to the Canadian
National Railways. I will give you the reason: it is because the Canadian Pacific has
acted with its employees in a manner different from what the Canadian National has
been doing lately.
Some honourable senators who travel on
trains use the Pullman cars and they have
no opportunity there to talk with railwaymen.
When a railwayman comes to you and in confidence tells you about his troubles, it is the
greatest honour that can be bestowed on
anyone, because that gentleman, the railway
employee, has enough trust in you to tell
you about his personal problems, and when
he asks for help it means that he has confidence in the one to whom he speaks. I am
sure that many honourable senators have
heard complaints from the men themselves.
They do not ask for charity-they are too
proud for that-but for fair treatment. What
I say here now applies generally to Halifax,
Moncton, Rivière du Loup, Montreal, and
probably Toronto and even Winnipeg. I say
that on behalf of my fellow citizens, good
red-blooded Canadians who have given years
of service to the Canadian National Railways,
who deserve to be treated better than they
have been by this administration.
Why was Sir Henry Thornton so popular?
Why do we see bronze tablets in every station erected to his memory? There is one
here in the Union station in Ottawa, and
another in Montreal; there are plaques everywhere on the system erected to his memory
because of what he did for the humble employees of the railway.
A great English preacher, Father Vaughan,
who died a long time ago, used to say, "No
job is unworthy of a man who is ready to
fill it to the best of his ability." Naturally,
there are many positions in the Canadian

When I board a train and go to sleep in the

SENATE

berth which I have bought, I do so without
worrying, because I trust the man at the
throttle, and the conductor-I trust the
whole crew of that train. All of you honourable gentlemen do the same thing. These
men deserve our consideration. I do not
speak on behalf of John, Dick or Tom, but
on behalf of men of all rank and file in the
Canadian National Railways; I say, they
are entitled to fair treatment and they must
get it by all means. We never cease to pray,
using the old form of petition; we will never
cease to pray that those men who are
humble, who make no noise, who work
assiduously, should be recognized and treated
as fellow Canadians by all of us in Canada,
especially by the Senate.
Hon. Arthur W. Roebuck: Honourable
senators, just a few words, if I may, please.
I wish to join the Leader of the Opposition (Hon. Mr. Macdonald) in a protest
against the way in which this bill was introduced, and the effort that is being made to
push it through the house without fair and
reasonable debate, or even time to prepare a
debate.
The sponsor of the bill (Hon. Mr. Haig)
tells us that the officials of the railroad have
already been invited to come tomorrow
morning and appear before the committee to
which this bill will be referred. That is to
say, the Government representatives in the
Senate have had the presumption to assume
that this house will pass this bill after a very
short debate, that it will be passed tonight,
in order that these men may be properly
welcomed tomorrow morning.
I have listened to the very complimentary
remarks made about various officials and
members of the staff of the railway, and in
them I most emphatically concur. I would
not for the world present an affront to the
officials of this railway when they come here
tomorrow morning. Were it not for that fact,
I would divide the bouse right now on a
motion to adjourn this debate. But I cannot
do that in the face of what the Government
representatives have already done in inviting
these officials to come on the assumption
that this house will dance to their particular
tune. I protest, but under the circumstances
what can we do? I hope that this kind of
jollying of this house will not continue.
When I asked the honourable sponsor of
the bill a question with regard to the discharge or the conclusion of the long engagement of George A. Touche and Co. as auditors
of the railway, and the appointment of new
auditors to fill their place, he referred me to
pages 3176 to 3184 of the Debates of the
Commons. That is to say, in order to find out
what the sponsor of the bill had to tell us, I

must read some eight pages of the Hansard
of the other house. I have done the best I
could with those eight pages, two columns
to the page, and I have picked out one point
to which I would like to draw particular
attention, since this has been made a portion
of the honourable senator's speech.
A member of the other house asked why
the change in auditors had been made, and
the answer, I think, is very illuminating. I
would like other senators in this house to
know just how old servants of the Crown
are being treated by the present Government.
The Honourable Mr. Hees made this reply:
The firm of George A. Touche and Company have
donc the auditing for the past 23 years. This Government is against monopoly; we are fundamentally
opposcd to it, and believe that in the interests of
the free enterprise system various business firms
should have opportunitiites from time to time to
do work of this kind. It is for that reason that
the auditors are being changed.

Now honourable senators, consider what
that means. The Government is opposed to
the monopoly of those who have served it
well. I would like to know how far this
monopoly goes. Does it extend to all those
who have served the country well for 23
years or some similar term? How long docs
a person have to serve Canada well to make
a monopoly of his services? Does this apply
to civil servants as well as to those engaged
by contract or by statute? Where does it
stop? What about all those able persons who
have managed our Crown companies for the
past 15 or 20 years? Are their services also
a monopoly to be dispensed with on such a
ground as that? Does not long and faithful
service deserve some consideration from those
now in office, or is the very length and quality
of their service a reason for their discharge?
I read further in the statement made in the
House of Commons and I learn that the gentleman who is to take the place of these ancient
and faithful servants was a candidate for the
Conservative party in the last general election.
Hon. Mr. Croll: In 1949.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: As I say, my reading
was necessarily hurried.
Of course, that fact has nothing to do
with the discharge! Certainly not! Polities
would never enter into the actions of the
present Government, and particularly those
of this gentleman, Mr. Hees, who spoke for
the Government in this regard. I protest
against this clause in the bill to change the
auditors for no real reason whatsoever, beyond a phony, miserable statement of the
Government
being in favour of free
enterprise.
I would like to know how long Mr. Hees
will stay in his office before he becomes a
monopoly, and whether it would not be a

AUGUST 12, 1958
good thing for free enterprise to dispense
with his services. I think it would probably
be in the interests of Canada to dispense with
the services of any man who gives an explanation of that kind for the ill treatment of
a faithful servant of this country.
I protest against the manner in which a
bill of this importance has been brought
before this house, with a statement of fact
that makes it almost impossible for us to
give the measure proper reading and attention, or to prepare speeches which a measure
that would hand over millions upon millions
deserves. I am not protesting against the
amounts which the bill would vote; I do not
know whether they are too much or too little.
Before the bill arrives I cannot decide
whether it is or is not a fit bill to be passed.
I would like time to consider and study it.
Honourable senators, I have made my
speech under these difficult circumstances,
and I am not going to move adjournment of
the debate.

my way I would telephone thern not to come
tomorrow. I move adjournment of the debate.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: I am sorry that the
honourable senator bas made this motion,
and I would like him to withdraw it. The
bill was given first reading last Thursday;
and there followed all the rest of that day,
and Friday, Saturday, Monday, and Tuesday
until this evening.
Hon. Mr. Croll: I want the honourable
Leader of the Government (Hon. Mr.
Aseltine) to understand that I have no objection to this bill. I have been a supporter of
the Canadian National Railways and the
principle of public ownership ever since I
was in knee pants. What I am protesting
against is being told that this bill must have
second reading tonight. I am saying "Curfew
shall not ring tonight". And that is my
answer.

He has been co-operative and helpful; he has,
as I stated, an understanding of the feelings
of the house, and he is not guilty of some
of the things which I have called to the
attention of honourable senators. Under no
circumstances would I embarrass him. On
the other hand, I do not want to be in the
position of one who is constantly crying
"Wolf" and having no attention paid to my
protests. I have, however, pointed out my
position; I have made it very clear; and on
the distinct understanding from the honourable leader that this sort of thing will not

AUGUST 12, 1958
APPENDIX
(See p. 486)
REPORT OF STANDING COMMITTEE ON FINANCE
THURSDAY, August 7, 1958.
The Standing Committee on Finance, to
whom was referred the Report of Central
Mortgage and Housing Corporation for the
fiscal year ended December 31, 1957, reports
as follows:On May 20, 1958, the following order of
reference was adopted by the Senate:
"That the Report of Central Mortgage and
Housing Corporation for the fiscal year
ended 31st December, 1957, be referred
to the Standing Committee on Finance
for consideration and report."
Subsequently the Committee held eight
meetings and heard evidence from the President of Central Mortgage and Housing
Corporation, Mr. Stewart Bates, and other
bodies interested in the building of houses.
The evidence adduced was sufficient, in the
opinion of your Committee, to justify the
early adoption of the recommendation set
forth herein.
1. Central Mortgage and Housing Corporation
A study of the evidence given by the
President of Central Mortgage and Housing
Corporation and after witnesses shows that
the position of the Corporation is one of
major importance to the economy of this
country. Your Committee feels that the
creation of conditions which will encourage
a vigorous house-building program is one
of the prime duties of Central Mortgage
and Housing Corporation. At the present
time, this duty is, in the opinion of the
Committee, being fully discharged.
It is evident that attention is being paid
by the Corporation to the requirements of
efficiency and economy in the use of public
funds. Your Committee feels that the reduction in staff, without loss of efficiency
or service, and its consequent saving in
money is singularly praiseworthy.
As the interpreter and administrator of
the Federal Government's housing policy,
under the National Housing Act, Central
Mortgage and Housing Corporation is, in the
opinion of your Committee, diligently discharging these duties.
The Annual Report for the year ended
December 31, 1957, which has been under
study by your Committee, is a full and frank
statement of the housing activities carried
out during the year 1957.
Exhibit 1 shows the various reserves
available for Mortgage Insurance, Home
Improvement Loan Insurance and Rental
Guarantees. From the evidence given on this
subject, there appears to be some doubt as

to whether the reserve fund for mortgage
insurance is adequate or excessive. The Committee feels that a closer study of this fund
is warranted. At the same time, it is the
opinion of this Committee that an adequate
margin of safety must be accumulated before any reduction in the mortgage insurance
fee is contemplated.
Your Committee therefore recommends
that an actuarial study be made of the Mortgage Insurance Fund, with a view to ascertaining the point at which a reduction
in the mortgage insurance fee might be
warranted.
2. Mortgage Insurance on Existing Residential Real Estate
Throughout the proceedings, frequent mention was made of the desirability of providing home ownership facilities for people of
low income (See Exhibit 2). One method by
which this could be partially achieved would
be to extend the facilities of the National
Housing Act to modest existing bouses.
Such an extension does not appear to be
appropriate at the present time. The Committee feels that Central Mortgage and Housing Corporation should keep this subject
under constant study with a view to advising
the Federal Government of a suitable time for
such an amendment. It is suggested that if
and when the time for such an amendment
arrives the facilities be limited to home owner
loans and that a modest loan limit be applied.
3. Loans for University Students' Dormitories
The Committee listened to evidence presented by the National Conference of Canadian Universities of the growing need for
providing accommodation to resident students.
At the present time, the Federal Government is facing increasing demands for financial assistance for various housing purposes.
The Committee is of the opinion that housing
people, particularly those of low income,
deserves the utmost priority. To this end, the
largest percentage of available mortgage resources, both federal and private, are
presently required. The provision of hostel
accommodation for universities is both desirable and necessary. At the present time, however, the federal funds available under the
National Housing Act are fully required for
housing purposes.
While sympathizing with the University
authorities in this problem, your Committee
does not feel that a recommendation for an
amendment to the National Housing Act permitting the use of federal funds for financing
such accommodation is merited at the present
time.

SENATE

However, as the evidence given to the Committee was to the effect that there is now no
source for borrowing money for the construction of university residences, in the further
study of this subject consideration might
well be given by Central Mortgage and Housing Corporation in conjunction with the
educational institutions and the provincial
departments concerned, to a suggestion that
loans on such residences by approved lending
institutions be qualified, subject to reasonable
conditions, for insurance under that part of
the National Housing Act providing for
insurance of loans.

The Committee heard, with interest, of the
plans of Central Mortgage and Housing Corporation to prepare designs for modest dwellings in the remote and outlying areas. It
is to be hoped that this work will be extended
to encourage a better standard of construction
in these areas.
Evidence bas been heard on the need for

AUGUST 12, 1958
Your Committee recommends that Central
Mortgage and Housing Corporation initiate
conversations with representatives of the
approved lenders, in an attempt to influence
the lenders to extend greater lending opportunities to the remote areas than exist at
present.
8. Urban Development
The Committee was impressed by the evidence given of the growing need for slum
clearance in many of our cities. Greater use
of the facilities available under the National
Housing Act will have to be made during the
next ten years if this problem is to be dealt
with.
From the evidence presented, it appears
that municipalities are not taking adequate
advantage of the opportunities for financial
assistance in redeveloping the substandard
areas of our cities.
It is to be hoped that possibly Central
Mortgage and Housing Corporation, in cooperation with the Federation of Mayors and
Municipalities, will provide more detailed
information on the facilities available under
the National Housing Act directly to municipal officials.
9. Co-operative Housing
Evidence was given of the success of cooperative housing projects in many parts of
the country. Inasmuch as this bas provided
economical and worthwhile housing, your
Committee feels that efforts by co-operative
groups to build their own houses should be
encouraged as much as possible.
It is suggested that much wider publicity
be given to the opportunities for co-operative
housing under the National Housing Act. The
Committee feels that the method of disseminating this information should be left to
the discretion of Central Mortgage and Housing Corporation.

10. Research into New Methods
of Construction
Evidence was given of the initiation of research projects by the Corporation (See
Exhibit 5). It is felt that this is to be highly
commended. Your Committee would like to
express the hope that the utmost priority be
given to further research work into finding
new methods of construction which will reduce the cost of housing, new methods of
sewage disposal, and new materials suitable
for construction in the northern areas.
It is hoped that the resources of private
industry will, at all times, be sought and that
the present close co-operation which exists
between Central Mortgage and Housing Corporation and the Division of Building
Research, National Research Council, will
continue.
Conclusion
The Committee bas been impressed by the
calibre of the witnesses heard and the quality
of the evidence given. In such a complex
field as that of housing the present and future
population of the country, it is inevitable
that differences of opinion exist on the best
means of solving the problem.
Nevertheless, your Committee feels that the
various organizations engaged in housing
activities are to be commended for their effort
and enterprise. In Central Mortgage and
Housing Corporation, the Committee is of the
opinion that the Federal Government has a
housing agency of the highest quality. It is
gratifying to note that the private interests
with whom the Corporation co-operates in
housing, building and financial matters hold
the organization in the highest esteem. Your
Committee expresses the hope that this close
liaison and co-operation will continue to
flourish in achieving the common aim of improving housing conditions in Canada.
All which is respectfully submitted.
C. G. HAWKINS,
Chairman.

SIMULTANEOUS TRANSLATION SYSTEM
INQUIRY
Hon. David A. Croll: I wish to direct a
question to the honourable Leader of the
Government (Hon. Mr. Aseltine). I wonder
if arrangements are being made for a simultaneous translation system in this chamber
in order to give effect to the two official
languages here?
Hon. Mr. Aselline: The answer would be
that I know of no such arrangements that
are in contemplation at the present moment.
I think it would be advisable for us to wait
and see how the system works in the other
chamber before we go to any expense of that
nature, but I will make inquiries.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Honourable senators,
I recall that at a meeting of the Internal
Economy Committee this year the matter was
discussed, and it was decided that if the
other house did establish such a system we

would see how it worked first before taking
any action. I think we took official notice
of the matter in that way.
Hon. Mr. Bruni: That is correct. We want
to make sure that they really get the system
in good working order in the other place
before we give consideration to it here. When
the system is installed in this chamber, we
would like to have it perfect.
Hon. Mr. Wall: Is the problem not one of
principle rather than of technicality?

CANADA-UNITED

STATES RELATIONS

PROPOSED JOINT PARLIAMENTARYCONGRESSIONAL COMMITTEES

On the Orders of the Day:
Hon. W. Ross Macdonald: Honourable senators, before we proceed with the Orders of
the Day I should like to call the attention
of the house to a matter in which I am sure
all honourable senators will be interested.
It will be recalled that on July 9 last this
house passed a resolution, proposed by the
honourable senator from Shelburne (Hon.
Mr. Robertson), as follows:
That the Senate of Canada welcomes the recent

suggestion of the Prime Minister of Canada for the
establishment of joint parliamentary committees
between Canada and the United States of America,
believes that it can be of great benefit in improving
relations between the two countries, and offers our
wholehearted co-operation.

Eight days later, on July 17, a motion was
proposed in the United States Senate by
Senator Neuberger, reading as follows:
This resolution shall become effective, and a
joint committee established, upon receipt by the
President of the Senate and Speaker of the House
of Representatives of notification that a committee
with similar functions and terms of reference has
been established by the Canadian Parliament.

I am sure all honourable senators were
pleased to learn yesterday that the Government of Canada proposed to recommend the
setting up of a committee in Canada as suggested by the motion of the honourable
senator from Shelburne (Hon. Mr. Robertson). I understand that the Prime Minister
has referred the whole matter to the
Speakers of both houses, and I am interested
in the representation from the Senate. A
number of honourable senators have had
on international
considerable experience
committees and could render excellent service in connection with this committee. I
think that even before the matter comes to
the attention of His Honour the Speaker the
Leader of the Government (Hon. Mr. Aseltine) should discuss this matter further with
the Prime Minister to make sure that the
Senate has adequate representation. I have
merely glanced at the Congressional Record
and I notice it was proposed in the motion
by United States Senator Neuberger that the
committee be quite a large one, representative of both houses of Congress.

I repeat my suggestion that the Leader of
the Government take this matter up immediately with the Prime Minister to make
sure that the Senate is given adequate representation.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: I agree with the remarks made by the honourable Leader of
the Opposition (Hon. Mr. Macdonald) and I
will follow up the matter as suggested by
him. I was very much interested in the
motion of the honourable senator from
Shelburne (Hon. Mr. Robertson) and I took
part in the debate upon it. I have not yet
had time to read what was said in the House
of Commons. I will certainly do my best to
see that the Senate is properly represented
on any body that is set up for this purpose.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators,
if I may say something on this: I was given
to understand today that four members would
be appointed from the House of Representatives at Washington and four from the United
States Senate. It might be proposed that,
similarly, the Canadian Government appoint
four members from the House of Commons
and four from the Senate. I do not know if
the body is to be bipartisan, but I imagine it
will be.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I do not want to discuss the matter further, but in reading the
Congressional Record report of the debate on
the motion by Senator Neuberger I gathered
his suggestion was that in addition to the
four members referred to by His Honour the
Speaker, who would be the permanent members of the committee, there should be another six members from each bouse, appointed
from time to time.
REPRESENTATION AT UNITED NATIONS
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Honourable senators,
I would also like to point out to the Leader
of the Government that, so far as I am aware,
there bas not been more than one, if indeed
there has been one, delegate appointed from
the present Parliament to the Assembly of
the United Nations. If my memory serves me
correctly, in the past it has been the custom
to have a number of alternate delegates, and
at least one of these delegates bas been a
senator. I think that practice should be continued and that we should have a delegate
from the Senate at the United Nations at
this very important time. May I also remind
the bouse, and especially the honourable
Leader of the Government, that it bas been
customary to have official observers from both
bouses at the meetings of the Assembly. I do
not think observers from either bouse are
there at the present time. Therefore, my
second suggestion to the honourable leader

SENATE
today is that he should take up this matter
also with the Prime Minister in the hope that
the Senate will be represented at the United
Nations by a delegate and by observers.
INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS
PRESS REPORT ON CANADA'S

ATTITUDE

On the Orders of the Day:
Hon. Vincent Dupuis: Honourable senators,
before the Orders of the Day are proceeded
with I would like to call the attention of
this house to an article published in the
Daily Telegraph of London, England, concerning the attitude of this country toward
international affairs. This newspaper's correspondent is Mr. Eric Downton who, I am
told, is a member of the Press Gallery here.
I was unable to obtain the issue of the
English paper in which the article appeared,
but I have a copy of Le Devoir of Montreal,
which carried a translation of it. I don't
intend to go into this matter fully now
because I have not the original text of the
article, although I believe that the translation is quite accurate.
This correspondent says that in the course
of the last few weeks the mind of the Canadian nation has changed altogether, to the
point of discovering that "we could very
well become the Belgium of the Third World
War". He proceeds to say that Canada is
seldom isolationist, except in Quebec-meaning that the Canadians of French origin in
Quebec have always been isolationists. He
said that Canadians have been isolationists
to the point of feeling a kind of egoistic
complacency and of detachment toward international affairs.
To find out the real meaning of the word
"isolationist" I took the trouble of going to the
Parliamentary Library, where I consulted the
Britannica World Language Dictionary. According to that dictionary isolationist means
"one who advocates national self-sufficiency
and freedom from foreign political and economic alliances".
Well, I am sure that this gentleman's views
do not represent the British Government's
opinion about our country at all, because the
British Government knows better. It knows
that we never have been isolationists, that
indeed the fact was very much to the contrary
during the last war and the previous World
War, when this country did its duty to the
full. I am sure that the British Government
and in general the people of the British
Isles were very grateful for our unlimited
contribution to the cause of our allies in
those wars. I would like to ask the correspondent through the honourable Leader of
the Government (Hon. Mr. Aseltine), why
he describes us in this country as isolationists.

Is it because the former Prime Minister of
Canada, the Right Honourable Mr. St.
Laurent, advocated the organization of NATO
to show the other part of the world which
had not our philosophy of life that we were
able to prepare a policy for the maintenance
of peace? Is it because we in this Parliament
have voted unanimously, every year since the
end of the last world war, billions of dollars
for our national defence as well as for aid to
other countries? Is it because the then Minister of External Affairs, Lester B. Pearson,
owing to his wisdom and his great experience,
prevented a Third World War over the Suez
mishap?
I will not say much more at present about
the attitude of Quebec in answer to this
writer. Yet, I would like to ask him why
he considers that as a people we had an exceptional attitude toward the last World War.
Is it because our men enlisted freely, without having guns held at their backs? Is that
why we are called isolationists all the time?
May I point out that in my own family eleven
nephews went to the war, and two of them
paid the supreme sacrifice. Are we in Quebec
called isolationists because of all those Canadians of French origin who did their duty
without being forced to do so? These are
questions I would like to have answered by
this newspaper correspondent.
Honourable senators, generally I do my
best to keep my temper, but such things as
these offend me deeply. I am sure this gentleman will see fit to correct his statements
in accordance with the facts and that in
future he will be more careful.
PENITENTIARY BILL
SECOND READING

Hon Léon Méthot moved the second reading of Bill C-21, to amend the Penitentiary
Act.
He said: Honourable senators, the purpose
of this bill is to remove the statutory provision which makes it automatie for the Commissioner and the Deputy Commissioners of
penitentiaries to retire at the age of 65 years.
The effect of the amendment would make it
possible to extend the terms of office of these
officers, if it is desired to do so.
According to the Act respecting Penitentiaries, Chapter 206, R.S.C. 1952, the Governor
in Council may, by section 4, subsections 1
and 2, appoint a Commissioner and two
Deputy Commissioners of penitentiaries.

Section 1 of the bill proposes that subsection (3) of section 4 of the Act be repealed. The subsection contains two conditions, namely, that these officers shall hold
office during pleasure only, and that they
must retire at the age of 65 years. At first

glance one would think these two conditions
in the present law are being repealed. I
hasten to say that the first condition, that of
holding office during pleasure only, will remain, because after the enactment of the
present bill these officers will be subject to
section 24 of the Interpretation Act, R.S.C.
1952, Chapter 159, which reads:

SENATE
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Commissioner of
Penitentiaries.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Thank you-as Commissioner of Penitentiaries. I recall that I
spoke on the occasion of his appointment,
referred to his experience and capabilities,
and expressed the hope that he would fulfil
to the utmost the expectations which so
many of us had of him. I think he bas done
that. He has been a splendid civil servant,
steady yet progressive in his attitude toward
prison administration. I am glad to see that
the Government is taking action to retain
his services so long as he is capable of performing them, and to retain the services of
his fellow commissioners. I commend the
Government for its action.
Motion agreed to and bill read second time.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, when shall this bill be read the third
time?
Hon. Mr. Méthol: With leave, I would
move the third reading now.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Unless there is some
reason amounting to necessity, let us follow
the regular rules. I cannot see that anything
is gained by giving two readings to this bill
in one day.
Hon. Mr. Monette: A good reason might be
its unqualified approval by the honourable
senator.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Oh, no. My approval
will stand, I suppose, until tomorrow. If it
does not it will be because, during the
interval, I have had reasons to change my
mind. That is very unlikely, but I reserve to
myself and the other members of this house
the right to contemplate the bill during the
next day and, perhaps, find some reason
to change our minds. That is why we do not
put bills through one-two-three, bang and
away. There are occasions when it is necessary or desirable to hurry the passage of a
bill, and in such cases I have no objection
to that being done. For instance, now and
again I have asked for leave to expedite the
first, second and third readings of divorce
bills, but there were sufficient reasons. This
bill, however, can be passed tomorrow just
as well as today, so I suggest that the rules
in this connection be maintained.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: The only reason for
urgency that I can imagine is that General
Gibson or one of these other gentlemen will
reach his 65th birthday tomorrow.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: General Gibson will
not be 65 for some months. There is no
urgency whatever in connection with this
bill; it can stand for third reading tomorrow.

The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, when shall this bill be read the third
time?
Hon. Mr. Méthot: Tomorrow.
INDIAN BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. James Gladstone moved the second
reading of Bill C-24, to amend the Indian Act.
He said: Honourable senators, this amendment has a great deal of importance attached
to it by myself personally and by many other
treaty Indians in this country. Not only does
it remove from the Indian Act certain clauses
which are objectionable, but it is a reassurance to the Indians of Canada that their
treaty rights are not being endangered.
During the weeks that I have listened to
the debates here I have heard two languages
spoken-English and French. To me, and to
other native Canadians, these are foreign
tongues. Therefore I should like to place in
the official Debates a few words in the
language of my own people, the Blackfoot
Indians, as a recognition of the first
Canadians.

My words, translated into English, were
these:
The Indians of Canada are very happy to know
they have someone in Ottawa to represent them in
the Government of Canada. I pray that I will be
able to speak the right words for them.

As this is my first address to the honourable members of this august chamber, I will
take the opportunity to bring before you
some of the history and problems of the
people I have the honour to represent.
It is a great honour to me personally to
be chosen to speak for my people. It is also
an honour to my own nation, the Bloods,
Peigans and Blackfeet. In the few months
since my appointment to the Senate I have
visited many Indians, in Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, British Columbia and the
Yukon, and everywhere I have been overwhelmed by the friendly feeling of the Indians who have received me. The great
regard these people have for the Prime
Minister for carrying out his pledge of appointing a member of their race to the Senate
was said by some to be the biggest moment
of their lives. Now they look forward to seeing some of the things which were promised
to us by our great mother, Queen Victoria.
In this brief time, I cannot begin to tell
you all about the history of my people. There

AUGUST 13, 1958

are more than 165,000 at the present time,
speaking about 50 different languages. Some
people think that if a man knows one Indian
language he knows them all. But this is not
true. For a Blackfoot to understand an Iroquois would be the same as an Eskimo understanding an Arab. Each of our languages is
separate, and their grammars are often more
complicated than English.
Besides speaking different languages, my
people have different problems. Some signed
treaties with the French or English, those
on the Prairies signed with the Canadian
Government, and some have no treaties at
all. In each case they were given different
promises or were governed under different
rules before the Indian Act came into being.
Now, in this modern world, some live by
farming or ranching, some by fishing, logging, trapping or hunting. Some have mixed
very well with their white neighbours and
work off their reserves; others have never
been more than a few miles away from
their own homes.
These are the people I must speak for and
their problems I must learn. It would be
easy if we could find one answer for everyone's problems, but what is good for one
tribe might be a hardship on another.
Tribal customs, treaties, and local needs all
have to be taken into consideration.
On my own reserve we have had many
problems over the years in dealing with
farming and also in holding onto our
reserve, which, by the way, is the largest in
Canada. When we were given our reserve,
in 1883, our head chief, Red Crow, asked
for the land between the Belly and Oldman
Rivers on one side and the St. Mary on the
other, from their confluence back to the
mountains. The Government surveyed the
land at five persons to a square mile, but
the Indians didn't have any idea of what a
square mile was. All they could understand
were the natural boundaries like rivers and
mountains. Since that time, many of my
people have felt that the reserve should have
gone right to the mountains, instead of being
cut off 15 miles from the United States
boundary. It is things like this which have
caused
suspicion
and misunderstanding
between the Government and the Indians.
Since they were given the reserve, the
Bloods have never surrendered any of it,
although we were often under great pressure
from the Government and other people to
do so. I remember our head chief, when
approached some years ago about surrendering his reserve, replied in this way. He bent
down and plucked a handful of grass and,
handing it over, said, "This you can use".
Then, bending down with his right hand, he
picked a handful of earth and pressed it to
57075-4-33J

his heart and said, "This is mine and will
always be mine for my children of the
future".
These words were always remembered by
our tribe, and even though various methods
were used to induce the Bloods to surrender,
our chiefs pleaded and cautioned the people
never to sell. One of the local newspapers
published an account of the attempted forced
surrender in 1907, which the Bloods turned
down. It said that our head chief, Crop
Eared Wolf, was "a particularly pig-headed
Indian who doesn't know what is good for
his people". I mention this incident because
I know of the hardship my people went
through because they were so stubborn.
I cannot pass by the early period without
paying tribute to our first Indian agents. They
toiled day in and day out to teach my people
how to plow and how to drive the yokes of
oxen. The Indians responded very well to
their teachings, and it is a matter of record
in the Indian Aff airs report for 1884 that my
reserve raised seven thousand bushels of
potatoes and also had other garden stuff, as
well as some oats and wheat.
But the Indian Department saw fit to make
regulations for the protection of the Indians,
and one of these was the permit system,
under which no Indian could sell anything
without a written permit from the agent. In
that year, a minimum price of 25 cents a
bushel was set for potatoes, and any Indians
who tried to barter their produce for less
were punished. As a result, by next spring
many of their root houses were still full, so
they felt there wasn't any use planting any
more until what they had was gone. Now,
wouldn't it have been better to let the Indians
dispose of their potatoes, even for 5 cents
a bushel, so they would keep on producing,
instead of discouraging them and .causing them
to quit farming? But the permit system
stayed on and, as years passed, many of the
later agents used it as a whip rather than a
protection for the Indians. Here, I am supporting the permit system for the purpose that
it had in the act, because but for that system
a great many of the Indians would have sold
everything they had, but what I am objecting
to is that many an agent used the system as
a whip. Those who would not co-operate
with the agent had a hard time getting permits to sell their grain, while those who were
the agent's pets didn't have any trouble at all.
A sister reserve of mine, the Blackfeet,
were induced to sell part of their land for
some $2 million, and the money was used for
the welfare of the tribe. But over the years
much of the money proposed for their welfare
turned out to be used for the benefit and
welfare of the Government and the Indian
office. Now this reserve is almost broke and

SENATE
the people are worse off than any of the
Indians who didn't sell their land.
When cattle were introduced to our reserve
many of the Indians did very well in looking
after their own individual herds. But again
the Government stepped in and told them
that the cattle should be handled as a single
herd. The owners reluctantly obeyed, with
the result that, as the years went by, the
only time they knew they had cattle was
when they got a cheque from the agency
office. But when severe losses were caused
by bad winters, the herds dwindled to such
an extent that the individual owners were
told to look after the cattle themselves. Some
of the owners were glad to get them back
and became successful ranchers, but most of
them had lost interest during the years the
herds had been taken away, and so they sold
them to other Indians or let them wander
out on the range.
It has been things like this that have
discouraged many of the Indians and made
them quit farming or ranching. When they
first settled on their reserves most of them
were anxious to work, but the Government
kept taking away more and more responsibilities until they lost their initiative and confidence. Some attempts have been made in
recent years to restore these things, but it
will take time. When a man is treated like
a child for many years, he is naturally slow
to take any responsibility. On some reserves
the Government has donc the Indian's work,
transacted his business, taken his children
away from his home to be educated and given
him no chance to think for himself or do
anything as an individual. And yet he is
expected to show progress.
The great need today is to assist and
encourage our people to work their lands
for themselves so they can support their
families by their own efforts. On reserves
such as mine, where there is good farming,
the young men should be screened before
being located. There are some people who
would never make a success of farming but
might be happier raising cattle or doing
other work. But they should be encouraged
to do these things themselves, without being
under the direction of the agent and being
forced to do things that they cannot succeed in.
I remember that I had no experience in
1929 which illustrates how the agent's control
can kill a man's initiative. I had threshed
about three thousand bushels of grain that
fall and had an operating debt of about $500
which was endorsed by order supplies from
the Indian agent. When the price of wheat
went up to $1.34 a bushel some of us farmers
asked the agent for a permit to sell our grain

so that we could clear our debts. But he
would not listen to us. He said he was holding out until the price rose to $1.40. Well,
the price dropped to about $1.00 and just
before Christmas it rose to $1.23. We felt
sure the agent would sell, but he didn't.
Then came the crash and our wheat was
finally sold for less than 80 cents a bushel
in the spring of 1930.
I was so discouraged that I quit farming
to go to work in the coal mines so that I
could support my wife and family. I didn't
go back to farming for three years. Other
farmers also were getting fed up with having all their business transacted by the agent
and were talking about quitting. It was then
that the Inspector of Indian Agencies asked
me to go back to my farm. I said I would
on condition that I would have the right to
do my own business under his direction, but
I felt I should have the right to sell the
proceeds of my land when I saw fit to sell it.
Those of us who were farming made a better
success of our lives when that right was
given to us.
During my recent travels to the various
reserves in the northern part of the provinces
I have seen that many of their timber

evidence in sawdust piles and stumps to
prove that they had timber, but all that is
left is bush and poplar. Where the land is
suitable it should be cleared and used for
farming or raising fodder for stock cattle,
rather than the Indians living on relief. It
would be much better if they could be put
to work to clear the brush off these lands so
as to make it productive for grain for fodder
and such like.
Most of these areas I have visited also
complain that commercial fishing bas depleted
the supplies and the Indians are having a
hard time catching enough fish to make a
living. But possibly the hardest bit is the
trapping industry, upon which so many of the
northern Indians depend for their livelihood.
Their problem is in not getting a sufficient
price for their furs to make their efforts
worth while. Inasmuch as other industries
are receiving assistance or subsidies from
the Government, it might be wise to
investigate the possibility of assisting the
Indian trappers by a form of subsidy that
will keep these people employed.
All these setbacks in farming, fishing and
trapping have contributed to a deep feeling
of frustration among these people. Many of
them want to work but they are thwarted
by a lack of employment or the lack of a
sufficient education to enter new kinds of
work. This frustration is also present among
some employees and agents of the Indian

AUGUST 13, 1958
Affairs Branch, who can see many means
of guiding the reserves to greater prosperity,
but find they must adhere to all the old rules
and regulations from Ottawa and there
appears to be little room for new ideas or
personal initiative.
I think my own reserve is a good example
of what might be done. Compare it with
the same area to the south of it. My reserve
comprises 540 square miles, and compare
that with the 540 square miles to the south
of it and see the wealth that has been
produced by the settlers who have come
there. It is the same to the east, where
wealth has been produced by the sugar beet
industry; and to the north and to the west,
where there is farming and ranching. Why
is it that our reserve hasn't managed to
produce wealth which would enable it to
be self-supporting? It could be very productive, it could produce a lot of wealth.
I have mentioned my own reserve, but this
situation exists in many places in Canada. It
might be possible to improve the situation
by the employment of farm managers who
could work with Indians in an effort to make
use of the reserves and eventually make them
self-supporting.
I must pause here to mention something
about the health services provided to the
Indians. In my own area, and I think in the
rest of Canada, the interest and attention
given by the Government has saved many
hundreds of lives. When the white man first
came to this continent he brought with him
many diseases that were unknown to the
Indian people. The Indian people had no
resistance to these new diseases and the
balance of nature was seriously disturbed.
Even within the past century many hundreds died from measles, smallpox and influenza. Tuberculosis was always one of the
most deadly killers after we settled on our
reserves. but the opening of sanatoriums,
such as the Charles Camsell Hospital in Edmonton, bas cut the TB rate away down.
The attention of nurses and doctors has also
reduced the infant mortality rate until today
I understand the Indians have one of the
highest birth rates in Canada.
The most important field-and for that reason I have left it until last-is the proper
education of my people. If we are to become
a success in anything today, we must be
properly educated, not only in academic subjects but in learning the life of the white
man of today. If our people are ta compete
in business and industry with the white man
we must be given the kind of education that
will be good enough and broad enough for
this purpose. Others, whose reserves are
located in areas where they must live by
hunting and trapping, should be given the

kind of education which will be of some
practical use to them. The old system of
trade schools, which was abandoned in western Canada many years ago, was one of the
best systems ever used by the Government.
On my own reserve, there are still one or
two persons using the trades which they were
taught more than half a century ago.
I believe it was the intention of Queen
Victoria's commissioners that the Indians
were gradually to receive better education
until they could look after themselves. But
today many of the old-timers have a better
and more practical education than their
grandchildren. From about 1915 right up until
the Second World War education in my area
was sadly neglected. Even after that time it
was almost impossible to send children away
from the reserve to receive a higher education. In my own case, I received practically
no help or encouragement in sending two
daughters away to train as nurses and another as a stenographer. In each case they
were the first from my reserve, out of a
population of over two thousand, to enter
the nursing and stenographic fields. That was
in the 1940's, over sixty years after the Bloods
had settled on their reserve.
Since then more and more children are
leaving their reserves ta get better education,
and the Government is recognizing the value
of this kind of education. In my travels I
have seen Indians trained to be lawyers, bookkeepers, nurses, nursing aides, plumbers and
other trades. Parents are beginning to realize
that their children need better education and
are asking to have them sent out to white
schools so that they can go on ta college or
university.
In my opinion, Indian children who go out
to public or separate schools will grow up
without a feeling of inferiority. As it is, when
many residential school Indians go out into
the world they feel the barrier and will not
mix with the white people. I think that
some of the residential schools could be
turned into trade schools, particularly for
pupils in the sixteen- to nineteen-year age
group. They could obtain their academic education in day or public schools and, at the
age of sixteen, those who wanted to learn
trades could attend these schools while others
continued with their regular schooling.
Always, when dealing with the administration of Indian affairs, it must be remembered
that everything depends upon education. You
cannot expect my people to show progress,
or to take their place in business and industry,
until they have an equal education, not only
in learning the three R's but in understanding
the world around them.
I hope that you will all be patient with
me in the months ahead. This is a new tribe

SENATE

for me and I have much to learn, not only
about the workings of our Government but
of the problems and needs of my people all
across Canada. When I speak for the Indians,
it will be only for them, and not for those
who are trying to tell them what to do. I
want to be their voice in Ottawa until they
all choose to take the federal vote for
themselves.
Honourable senators, may I sum up what
I have already said. The Indian people have
an innate sense of pride, self-respect and
love of this beautiful country of Canada. As
the original inhabitants they want not the
patronage or tolerance of their fellows, but
rather their understanding and help-so that
they may materially improve their lot and
status in the months and years to come, and
so that "equality of opportunity" and "equal
status" will mean something in the future.
If we in Canada can freely grant aid, comfort
and recognition to under-developed and distressed people all over the world, at the public expense, we can well afford to have a
careful and continuous regard to the fulfilment of the legitimate, and indeed, humble,
aspirations of our native population. We must
give encouragement and provide economic,
and in particular educational, aid to the
thousands of our own people who need it,
and who, in a specially Canadian sense, deserve it.

I say this in a completely non-partisan
spirit. The Indian people need the understanding and support and deserve the confidence of all Canadians, regardless of party,
race or creed. This co-operation I now earnestly solicit in the hope and expectation that
it will be freely granted.
Hon. Vincent Dupuis: Honourable senators,
I do not think there is one among us more
qualified than I to congratulate the honourable senator from Lethbridge (Hon. Mr.
Gladstone) on his kind remarks concerning
the interests of his race, the first occupants
of this country. When, in 1929, I actively
entered the field of public life, I was elected
by acclamation in the constituency of Laprairie-Napierville, where the Caughnawaga Reserve of the Iroquois tribe is situated. I had
the great honour of being named one of the
honorary chiefs of that tribe, in a most
memorable ceremony.
My distinguished colleague from Mille
Isles (Hon. Mr. Monette), comes from my old
home town. Incidentally, may I say how
rare it is in this house that two senators
should come from the same parish. It proves
that the town of our origin is a great place.
I am pleased to congratulate the honourable senator from Lethbridge on the beautiful and appropriate language which he used
on this his first occasion to speak in the

Senate. The first occupants of this country
are indeed entitled to great consideration. We
see today in the Middle East the awakening
of the Arab people, a race which feels that
it can now govern itself and that it has a
right to do so, and to develop its own resources. The Western countries are beginning
to understand that situation. In a sense, the
Indians of Canada have similar rights. The
very able speech of my colleague from
Lethbridge shows that the people of his race
realize they deserve some consideration in
this country. I am sure all honourable
senators are willing to do their best to cooperate with the other bouse to give maximum
credit and render justice to these people, the
first occupants of this country.
Hon. Gustave Monette: Honourable senators, I beg your patience while I join my
friend from Rigaud (Hon. Mr. Dupuis) in
expressing a few words on this extraordinary occasion. I was one of the first who
had the privilege to shake hands with the
new senator from Lethbridge (Hon. Mr.
Gladstone) when he was sworn in, and J
share the feeling expressed by the honourable
senator from Rigaud. In doing so, I do not
speak with the voice of an Indian Chief,
but I can perhaps speak for some people
who are not Indian Chiefs.
It is true that in the constituency of Laprairie-Napierville we have the Caughnawaga
Reserve, where the Iroquois Indians live.
At the time the Indians were gallantly fighting against the French, some of them crossed
the border from the United States to Canada,
and in their excursions to Montreal they
settled in that area and established a reserve
at Caughnawaga. Then when Quebec passed
to the English there was already a host of
Iroquois settled at Caughnawaga. They knew
the French race better at that time and,
most of them being Catholic, adopted, as
sometimes happens, the rules of Christianity
according to the church in the community
in which they live.
Although I had not had intensive experience in politics, I had the honour on
one occasion to be a candidate opposing
my honourable friend from Rigaud. He,
being eloquent and experienced in politics
and possibly more resourceful than I, succeeded in retaining the seat. But fortune
has given me the opportunity to be here
and join him in the compliment he has paid
to the traditional tribe of the Iroquois.
The honourable senator from Lethbridge
spoke today of the virtues and the shortcomings of his people. He spoke about the
need for education, not necessarily in the
fields of literature or ancient philosophy, but
in the ways of life of the other people with

AUGUST 13, 1958
whom they are called upon to live. His remarks bring to mind the Indians of Caughnawaga who, living as they do among
farmers and close to industrial Montreal, are
coming nearer and nearer to equality with
other Canadian citizens, even in their industrial and commercial activities and in
the Canadian way of life.
It is for these reasons that I feel the
honourable senator is quite right in his
desire that the Indian people-and this
applies to immigrants, as well-should be
given a chance and be helped to become
integrated into the atmosphere and ways
of life of the country in which Providence
bas called them to live.
It gives me great pleasure to offer my
very best wishes to the honourable senator
from Lethbridge and to congratulate him on
being appointed to this house to represent
the Indians of Canada. I am sure the appointment will mean much to his race, and
I earnestly hope that public men and women
of this country will co-operate to give his
people a chance to make their maximum
contribution to Canada. We have much to
learn from the first inhabitants of Canada
as well as from those who come here as
immigrants.

senator who has just spoken presented to

The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, when shall the bill be read the third

Hon. Mr. Gladstone: Next sitting.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I might remind the
bouse that the Senate passed this bill last
session. It received three readings, and was
subsequently passed in the House of Commons. However, Parliament was dissolved
rather suddenly, with the result that the bill
did not receive Royal Assent. Under these
circumstances honourable senators might be
prepared to give it third reading today.
Hon. Mr. Croll: I thought that, in view
of the importance of this bill and the significance of the occasion, as well as the capable
manner in which it was introduced, we
should leave it on the Order Paper for another day, so as to enjoy it.

As a result of this pressure an investigation
I will say no more, honourable senators was made last October by engineers and
but I wanted you to know that I was very economists of both departments, and it was
happy, as I believe most of you were, to found that the present terminals operated by

SENATE

the Canadian Pacific Railway in Fort William and the Canadian National Railways
in Port Arthur were obsolete; and further,
that there were no facilities there for unloading to motor transport; and finally, that
the seaway depth of 27 feet-which means
that when the Seaway is completed boats
drawing 27 feet will be able to go to Port
Arthur and Fort William-could not be provided at the present wharves owing to the
fact that the foundations of the wharves will
not permit additional dredging. Accordingly,
a recommendation was made that a new
modern terminal be constructed to handle all
types of traffic and that the management of
this terminal be placed in the hands of harbour commissioners.
Incidentally, I might point out that this
proposal was supported by the Governments
of Ontario, Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta, and in addition by the municipal councils of the cities of Fort William and Port
Arthur, and finally by both railroads and all
trucking associations.
There is a relatively large tract of land,
located between the two cities, on Thunder
Bay, which is most suitable for the construction of a proper terminal.
On June 6 last the Minister of Public
Works announced in the other place that a
consulting firm had been retained to carry out
surveys and prepare proper plans for a Lakehead terminal estimated to cost between $3
million and $4 million.
This bill incorporates a body to manage
the harbours of Port Arthur and Fort William as one harbour, and the body is to be
known as the Lakehead Harbour Commissioners.
The bill is a logical forward step in the
development that is expected to take place
on the completion of the St. Lawrence
Seaway.
This bill is similar to one passed during
April 1957, when a corporate body known
as Windsor Harbour Commissioners, at
Windsor, Ontario, was set up. There is a
slight difference between the two bills, in
that both Port Arthur and Fort William will
have representation on this commission, one
commissioner being appointed by the municipal council of each city, and three commissioners being appointed by the Governor in
Council. The commissioners will have complete jurisdiction, of course, over all of the
harbour used by both cities.
The matter of receipts and expenditures
will be dealt with by the commissioners.
However, any revenue which remains in the
hands of the commissioners over and above
the operating expenses of the harbour and
necessary working capital will, of course, be
paid to the Receiver General of Canada. For

the information of honourable senators I might
point out that during the year 1957 there was
collected from all publicly-owned terminal
facilities, as now existing in the cities of
Port Arthur and Fort William, a total amount
of $13,800, made up of harbour dues of $12,000
and revenues from leases of water-lots of
$1,800.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: Would my honourable
friend permit a question?
Hon. Mr. Brunt: Yes.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: Who operates these public
facilities now?
Hon. Mr. Bruni: The two cities. In addition
they have the facilities that are operated by
the C.N.R. and C.P.R. Naturally, with the
change that will be brought about with the
construction of the new terminal, this revenue
will increase greatly.
I should like now to deal briefly with the
bill, clause by clause, commencing with
clause 3, the interpretation clause. Here the
words "by-law", "commissioner", "goods",
"harbour", "minister", "rate" and "vessel" are
defined. All the definitions are self-explanatory, and I do not think anything needs to be
added to any of them.
Clause 4 sets out the metes and bounds
description of the harbours of Port Arthur
and Fort William, located on Thunder Bay.
It is within these boundaries that the commissioners will have the right to control
the operation of ships.
Clause 5 sets up the composition of the
commission. As I have already pointed out,
the city of Port Arthur names one commissioner, the city of Fort William names one,
and the remaining three are named by the
Governor in Council.
Clause 6 of the bill gets us away from
monopolies, which have been before this
house all day, in that it sets out the term of
office of the commissioners. Honourable
senators will note that each commissioner is
appointed for a period of three years only.
It is further set out in clause 6 that no
member of the municipal council of either
Port Arthur or Fort William shall be eligible
to be appointed as a commissioner.
Clause 7, which is brief, provides for each
commissioner to take the oath of office.
Clause 8 deals with the matter of election
of a chairman, sets forth what shall constitute a quorum, and finally decrees that the
remuneration for the services of the commissioner shall be fixed by the Governor in
Council from time to time.
Clause 9 deals with the employment of a
harbour master and other officers and employees necessary for the carrying out of the
terms and provisions of this bill.

AUGUST 13, 1958
Clause 10 deals with the jurisdiction of the
corporation within the harbour itself.
Clause 11(1) gives to the corporation the
right to deal with private lands. Clause 11(2)
gives to the corporation the right to deal with
Crown and city lands. Clause 11(3) gives the
corporation the right to dispose of Crown
lands, with the consent of the Governor in
Council.
Clause 12 is a rather long one. It gives to
the corporation the right to make regulations
with respect to the following matters: (1) the
control of waterfront property; (2) the construction of harbour facilities; (3) the matter
of railways operating on the corporation's
lands; (4) the operation of motive machinery
of every kind and nature within the harbour; (5) any work undertaken by the
corporation affecting the use of navigable
waters, such work being subject to the
Navigable Waters Protection Act.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Has it rights of
expropriation?
Hon. Mr. Bruni: Yes. I shall come to that
a little later.
Clause 13 is another long one. It sets out in
detail matters which can be dealt with by
bylaws passed by the corporation. This clause
further provides that no bylaw shall come
into effect until the following requirements
have been complied with, namely, that: (1)
the bylaw has been served upon the Clerk
of the City of Port Arthur and also upon the
Clerk of the City of Fort William; (2) it has
been published in the Canada Gazette; and
(3) it has been confirmed by the Governor in
Council.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Are these the same
powers that are usually given to other
commissioners?
Hon. Mr. Bruni: Yes. There is a small
difference as to the appointment of commissioners and things like that.
Clause 13 provides also that any bylaw
passed by this corporation shall be accepted
as evidence in all the courts in Canada.
Clause 14 relates to the borrowing powers
of the corporation and gives to the corporation the right to borrow money and to issue
debentures in multiples of $100. No debenture,
however, shall be issued for a longer period
than 40 years. All bonds and debentures are
a charge on the real property vested in the
corporation. Finally, the prior approval of the
Governor in Council must be obtained before
any bonds and debentures can be issued.
Clause 15 deals with finances and provides
what shall be charged against the revenues
of the corporation. It further provides that
any revenue remaining in the hands of the
corporation after the payment of operating
expenses and the setting aside of a proner
57075-4-34

sum for working capital shall be paid to the
Receiver General of Canada within four
months of the end of each fiscal year.
Clause 16 provides for the setting up of a
proper accounting system and for the inspection of all books set up by the corporation. Such books shall be open at all times
for inspection by: (1) the Minister of Transport; (2) the City Councils of the cities of
Port Arthur and Fort William and (3) such
other persons authorized by the minister or
the said councils.
Clause 17 deals with the matter raised by
the Honourable gentleman from TorontoTrinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck). It gives to the
corporation the right of expropriation, and
the same shall be done in accordance with
the terms of the Railway Act. In all cases,
however, the right to expropriate cannot be
exercised without first obtaining the consent
of the Governor in Council.
Clause 18 deals with the matter of setting
up of harbours rates and the settling of disputes in connection with the same.
Clause 19 provides for the seizure of vessels in any case where the harbour dues are
not paid.
Clause 20 provides for the seizure of goods
under the same circumstances.
Clause 21 relates to the detention of goods
seized and the method to be followed in
order to effect a valid and proper seizure.
If honourable senators will look at that
clause they will find there is no provision
for the sale of goods that are seized. On
making inquiries with reference to this I was
advised by officials of the department that
the sale of goods seized under circumstances
such as this is conducted under the terms of
some other act, and they have agreed to give
us particulars with respect to this when the
bill is before the Committee on Transport
and Communications.
Clauses 22, 23 and 24 are of a general
nature, and no explanation of them is necessary.
Finally, clause 25 provides that the bill
shall come into force on a day fixed by the
Governor in Council.
Honourable senators, it is my intention to
refer this bill to the Committee on Transport
and Communications, at which hearing two
or three members from the Department of
Transport will be present.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Are they coming tomorrow?
Hon. Mr. Bruni: If you so desire they could
be here tomorrow morning.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: No arrangements have
been made for tomorrow?
Hon. Mr. Bruni: Not as yet, but we could
have them here on very short notice. These

SENATE
gentlemen would give a much fuller explanation of the bill than I have given this afternoon, and would be prepared to answer questions which might be raised by any honourable
senators.
If there are any questions that honourable
senators would like to ask at this time I will
endeavour to answer them to the best of my
ability.
Hon. Mr. Wall: May I ask the honourable
senator if by the boundaries of the Lakehead
harbour is meant just the part of the harbour
that would be under the jurisdiction of the
commission?
Hon. Mr. Bruni: When this bill is passed
and the new terminal facilities are set up
that will be the only harbour; it will be an
entirely new harbour.
Hon. Mr. Wall: And may I ask, with regard
to the facilities that are projected for this
particular harbour which are going to be
built at federal expense, what are the considerations which led to the choice of
administration by the Lakehead Harbour
Commissioners rather than administration
under the National Harbours Commission?
Hon. Mr. Bruni: I am afraid I do not understand the honourable senator's question.
Hon. Mr. Wall: Well, there is a basic choice.
Some of our harbours are administered under
the National Harbours Board. Here we are
setting up an independent harbour commission. What are the basic considerations that
led to this choice?
Hon. Mr. Bruni: The honourable senior
senator from Ottawa (Hon. Mr. Lambert)
has provided me with the explanation. He
stated that the harbours which are administered by the National Harbours Board are
those that deal with ocean ships only, whereas the harbours on the Great Lakes, which
are inland waters, are all usually under the
jurisdiction of a harbour commission.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: That might change now.
There will be no inland harbours in eastern
Canada.
Hon. Mr. Lamberi: Car. *e honourable
senator indicate how the operations at Port
Arthur and Fort William have been handled
in the past? There is no commission at the
Lakehead, so I presume the operations have
been handled by harbour masters.
Hon. Mr. Bruni: I understand that the
facilities at the freight terminals in Fort
William are operated by the Canadian Pacific
Railway at the present time, and those in
Port Arthur are operated by Canadian
National Railways. That is, the big part of
the terminal facilities consists of these two
terminals operated by the two railroads. In

addition, there is a small public terminal,
which in 1957 produced a revenue of $13,800.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: I think it is surprising
that a harbour commission of this sort for
the head of the lakes has not been operating
before now. There are harbour commissions
in Toronto, Hamilton, Windsor, and also, as
a matter of fact, at Winnipeg. From the point
of view of in-and-out shipping, no point is
more important than at the head of the lakes.
I would think that the management of that
operation by a harbour commission, especially during the heavy movement of grain,
would be very desirable. Just how the harbours of both Fort William and Port Arthur
have been regulated in the past is more or
less of a mystery to me. Offhand I should
know more about it than I do, but I fancy
that the municipalities of both cities have
had control of the harbour operations through
an appropriate commission.
Hon. Mr.

Hon. Mr. Roebuck: There is one point that

of the bill says:

Section 22

Where, by or under this act, a person is required
to take an oath, it may be administered by a commissioner, the secretary of the corporation, the
harbour master or a justice of the peace.

That seems to be all-inclusive. I think it

should be made clear-and perhaps it is as
well to mention it now so that it may be
considered prior to the appearance of officials

before the committee-that others are quite
capable of swearing affidavits-for instance,
commissioners for the taking of affidavits, and
notaries public. Also, it will be seen from the
Evidence Act that a certain status is given
to persons abroad who take affidavits which

are sworn out of Canada. I think that should
be made clear. It may be that the Justice
Department would say this is only granting
additional powers, but it certainly is not clear
that that is so. I think that section 22 as it
stands would be misundersood as limiting the
right to those who are enumerated, and
excluding the right of those who are not.
Hon. Mr. Bruni: I might say to the honourable senator from Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr.
Roebuck) that the purpose of this clause, as
I understand it, is to extend the right-that

if this clause was not in the bill, then unless
a commissioner was one of the persons now
qualified to take an oath he would not be
allowed to do it.

AUGUST 13, 1958
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Yes, but you are including here a justice of the peace. He is already
able to take an affidavit.
Hon. Mr. Bruni: Yes. I do not think those
words are at all necessary.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: This is distinctly
limiting, I should think.
Hon. Mr. Bruni: No. If it were limiting,
the clause would say "shall" instead of "may".
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: As the honourable
senator from Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck) has said, a justice of the peace can take
an affidavit. A commissioner also can take one.
Hon. Mr. Bruni: "Commissioner" refers to
a harbour commissioner, not the ordinary
commissioner who takes oaths.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I presume "commissioner" means a commissioner of the Supreme
Court.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: I would think it means
a commissioner under the act.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: All right. Then affidavits could be sworn before only those who
are mentioned in the section.
Hon. Mr. Bruni: The clause could not
possibly be limited to that interpretation.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Well, as the senator
from Toronto-Trinity pointed out, it includes
a justice of the peace.
Hon. Mr. Bruni: If the clause was intended
to have a limiting effect, the word "shall"
would have been used instead of "may".
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Not at all. That is not
necessarily the correct interpretation. Why
does the section not say a justice of the peace
and a notary public?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Or a commissioner for
taking affidavits.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I agree with the
honourable senator from Toronto-Trinity
that the matter should be cleared up in
committee.
Hon. Mr. Bruni: We will have to have
someone from the Department of Justice to
clear up that particular point.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Who ever drew up the
bill?
Hon. Mr. Croll: Be sure you
lawyer to explain it.

bring a

Hon. Mr. Bruni: Why not just make it
read "a barrister or solicitor"?
Hon. Mr. Wall: Honourable senators, may
I ask a question arising out of the one that
I already asked, also connected with what
57075-4-34j

the sponsor of the bill said concerning pressure from modernized facilities. Some of
this came from Manitoba I know, resulting
in an investigation by departmental engineers and economists, and I have asked for
a report so that I could see what has been
looked into. Although this is not stated in the
bill, the sponsor mentioned that there is
going to be a new modern terminal, complete with wharves and other appurtenances,
and built at public expense. Is that then to
be turned over to the Harbour Commissioners, so that they will begin operations
with a modern port equal to the kind of
demands that are going to be made on it
in a harbour which is going to be a rather
unique one because it is going to funnel so
much trade into the west? The reason I
asked earlier why it was decided to set up
an independent board of harbour commissioners instead of placing this harbour under
the National Harbours Board was that I
think this port is going to be unique. Is it
the intention of the Government to have
this commission begin its operations with a
modern port which in effect has been gifted
to it by the federal Government?
Hon. Mr. Bruni: Honourable senators will
remember that at the last session I sponsored
a bill which dealt with harbour facilities in
the city of Hamilton. That bill gave the
Harbour Commissioners there power to borrow $4 million to improve their facilities.
Under the present bill it will be necessary
for the Lakehead commissioners, as I understand it, to issue debentures and borrow
money to create the harbour facilities. They
are not going to be built by the dominion
Government and then presented as a gift
to the Harbour Commission.
Hon. Mr. Wall: That modern terminal, to
be built at a cost of around $3 or $4 million,
is to be then purchased by the Harbour
Commission?
Hon. Mr. Bruni: No. The land will be
conveyed to the Harbour Commission and it
will proceed to have this terminal built
and will issue bonds to pay the cost of this
terminal harbour.
Hon. Mr. Wall: I see.
Hon. Mr. Hayden:

Can the honourable

senator tell us why it is that pecuniary dealings only between the corporation and the
members are prohibited? Why is there a
limitation to things that can be bought and
sold?
Hon. Mr. Bruni:
kind of deals?

Are there any other

Hon. Mr. Hayden: I would think so.

SENATE
Hon. Mr. Brun±:

I think those are all the

dealings one would have to cover in a bill.
Hon. Mr. Hayden:

I do not know what

the commission has to sell other than services.
Hon. Mr. Lamberi: The commissioners must
not have any property interest.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: I would think that is so.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: I suppose one commissioner could marry another commissioner's
daughter.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: I would think that is
so too.

Hon. Mr. Monette: May I ask the honourable senator from Hanover (Hon. Mr. Brunt)
a question? Who is to be the owner of
property subsequently acquired? In clause 17
of the bill provision is made for the corporation to expropriate but it is not stated whether
the fact of expropriation will make the property the property of the Government.
Section 10 provides that:
Subject to this act, the corporation has jurisdiction within the limits of the harbour, but nothing in
this act gives the corporation the rigbt to enter
upon or to deal with any property of Her Majesty-

I understand the property is at present
standing in the name of Her Majesty.
Section 11 speaks of expropriation, in these
words:
(1) The corporation may purchase, expropriate or
otherwise acquire and hold, lease, sell or otherwise
dispose of such land, buildings or other property,
real or personal, within the harbour as it deems
necessary-

But the bill does not state that any property once acquired by expropriation or otherwise becomes definitely the property of the
corporation as distinct from the Government
of Canada. Is there anything to show that
any property owned at any time by the
corporation would be the property of Canada?
Maybe I have overlooked many things, for
I read the provisions of the bill a little fast,
and if the honourable senator prefers I could
wait until tomorrow for the answers.
Hon. Mr. Brunt: The only answer I can
give to the honourable senator is that nowhere
in the bill is there any reference to the
Government of Canada acquiring property at
any time. The one body that shall have the
right to purchase, acquire or expropriate
property of any kind is the corporation. I
think it is to be presumed that if the corporation goes out and purchases land it will
become the owner of the land.
Hon. Mr. Monette: So land that is bought
or expropriated by the corporation becomes
the property of the corporation exclusively.
Motion was agreed to and bill read second
time.

ESTATE TAX BILL
MOTION FOR SECOND READINGDEBATE ADJOURNED

Hon. Gunnar S. Thorvaldson moved the
second reading of Bill C-37, respecting the
taxation of estates.
He said: Honourable senators, the federal
Government first introduced legislation to
tax estates of deceased persons in 1941. The
name of the legislation was the Dominion
Succession Duty Act. Prior to the year
mentioned all the provinces of Canada had
made use of estates of deceased persons as
a source of revenue. It is interesting to note
that the first province to tax estates or successions, in Canada-that is to apply death
duties, as we generally call them-was the
province of Ontario, which did so in 1892.
It is interesting also to note that the preamble of the Ontario legislation referred to
the necessity for the tax to raise money for
charitable purposes.
Although the dominion legislation in this
field was dictated by wartime necessity,
nevertheless the Honourable Mr. Ilsley, then
Minister of Finance, made it clear that the
federal entry into this field of taxation was
not temporary but was to be permanent.
In 1947 all the provinces, with the exception of Ontario and Quebec, by agreements
with the federal Government vacated this
field of taxation. These agreements have
been twice renewed for five-year periods so
in the result Ontario and Quebec are the
only provinces that now levy succession or
death duties.
Bill C-37, called "An Act respecting the
taxation of estates", is intended to replace
the present Dominion Succession Duty Act.
The proposed law is designed to overcome
as far as possible those features of the present law which seem unfair, or severe, or
impose inconvenience on the taxpayer, or
leave the way open for tax avoidance.
The outstanding features of this bill are
(1) its greater simplicity-although I think it
must be admitted that no fair or adequate tax
legislation can in this day be simple-and,
(2) its generally lower tax burden, particularly on small estates and on estates where
the deceased leaves a widow and dependent
children.
This tax relief is accomplished with an
estimated loss of revenue of about 10 per
cent of the present normal annual revenue
from estates, which amounts to approximately
$60 million.

AUGUST 13, 1958
The main change in the principle of the
new act can best be described by comparing
the methods of imposition of tax under the
two acts.
Hon. Mr. Euler: May I ask my friend a
question? He spoke of the loss of revenue
being 10 per cent, and then hie mentioned
the arnount of $60 million. Does hie mean the
total annual revenue is now $60 million or
$600 million?
Hon. Mr. Thorvaldson: The computation of
the department, I believe, is that the expected
revenue under the new act will be about
10 per cent of $60 million, whîch amount is
approximately the annual revenue from the
Dominion Succession Duty Act.
Han. Mr. Bruni: In other words, $6 million?
Hon. Mr. Thorvaldson: Yes, $6 million.
However, while we refer to a contemplated
loss of revenue in regard to estate taxes or
succession duty taxes, I think all honourable
senators are aware that revenue from taxes
of this kind fluctuates very greatly from year
to year. If a person of very considerable
means dies in a certain year, the revenue
from estate taxes in that year will rise
greatly. For instance, some two or three
years ago two very wealthy Canadians died
within one year, and consequently the revenue from the Dominion Succession Duty
Act for, I believe, two years was greatly in
excess of the normal amount. Such facts
must be borne in mind in regard to possible
revenue from taxes of this kind, year by
year.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I suppose the calculation of 10 per cent would be taken on
an average over a 10-year period?
Hon. Mr. Thorvadson: I would think that
is the only way one could be at ail accurate
in making such an estimate.
The present Succession Duty Act imposes
a tax on the succession to property on its
devolution to successors or beneficiaries.
Hence the expression "succession" duty. It
is sometimes alternatively called a tax on
inheritances. Under the present act the tax
varies according to several factors, narnely,
the value of the total estate, the value of
the individual bequests or inheritances, and
the degree of relationship between the deceased person and the person to whom
property is transmitted. Under the present
act, there being four classes of successors,
there are five different rates or classifications
of duty, and the tax fails on the beneficiary
successor. The reason I refer to there being
five different rates of duty is that there is,
firstly, one known as the initial rate, and

then there are four classes of differing consanguinity, each of wbich bears a different
tax rate.
Han. Mr. Roebuck: You are setting aside
that recognition of the family, are you not,
in this bill?
Hon. Mr. Thorvaldson: In the respect in
which I arn speaking now, that may be so,
but I think it will appear from my further
remarks that that feature is being taken
care of by other provisions of the measure
which protect the dependents of deceased
persons. 1 will come to that point in a
moment.
The proposed Estate Tax Act, on the other
hand, imposes a single tax on the aggregate
value of the estate, and the rate of that tax
is not affected by considerations of the relationship between the deceased and the beneficiaries; that is to say, the identity of the
successors is ignored and the tax falîs on
the estate. Under the present act the primiary
liability for payment of tax rests upon the
successors; under the new act this primary
liability will be placed upon the executor.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: But in actual fact, wblle
the prirnary responsibility is on the beneficiary, it is paid by the estate, is it not?
Hon. Mr. Thorvaldson: That is right. Under
the present act there is a secondary liability
on the executors.
Han. Mr. Raebuck: The final effect of if is
that the executor, or the person representing
the estate, has paid it, because hie has had to
protect bimself.
Han. Mr. Thorvaldson: That is correct. But
in the proposed law that situation is reversed,
and the primary liability for payment of tax
is placed upon the executor, with a secondary
liability irnposed on the beneficiary. I will
corne t0 that point in a moment.
This formi of tax avoids to a great extent
the whole range of difficuit problems involved
in deterrnining who are the beneficiaries
of an estate and how rnuch each receives.
As I said before, this change in assessrnent
approach is the most fundamental difference
in principle as between the two acts and
At is what has made possible much of the
simplification that has been achieved in the
new act.
Let me here give one example to indicate
a difference in the effect of the application
of the new act and the present act in a particular instance. Under the present acf, take
the case of an employer wbo bas an estate
valued under $50,000 and leaves a bequest
of $5,000 f0 bis cook. In that case the cook
would get the $5,000 clear. But if the employer
left a taxable estate of, say, $1 million, the

SENATE

cook would find that her bequest was subject
to a duty of nearly $1,000. Under this bill,
however, with the shifting of the tax from
the succession to the estate, and the executor
paying the duties as a testamentary expense,
the cook in the second instance would get her
whole legacy in the same way as in the first.
Hon.

Mr.

Macdonald:

Hon. Mr. Bruni: The preferred one, prob-

ably.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: It is a debt against the

estate.
Hon. Mr. Thorvaldson: Yes, the tax under

the proposed act is a debt against the estate.
Of course, it must be remembered that a
testator can do various things in a will, one
of which is to impose the tax directly on a
successor or beneficiary, if he chooses to do
so. The example which I gave was of course
in the case of two wills which said nothing
in regard to who should pay the tax. Here the
Dominion Succession Duty Act applied as
it did without anything having been said in
the will about payment of the tax or duty
that might accrue.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Is it not a fact that you

are proposing to change all the wills that
contain a provision such as you have just
now referred to, where the will is so drawn
that the testator intends the beneficiary to
pay the succession duty? When you change the
act, are you not in effect changing these wills?
Hon. Mr. Thorvaldson: I would ask the hon-

ourable senator to allow that point to stand
until later, when I will come to it and read a
statement which was read in the other place
yesterday on that very point.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Thank you.
Hon. Mr. Thorvaldson: I come

now to a

point that was referred to by the honourable
senator

from

Toronto-Trinity

(Hon.

Mr.

Roebuck) a little earlier, in regard to protecting the element of dependency of a decedent. That is being done under the proposed
act by a method of exemption or a deduction
from a tax liability of a certain portion of the
estate. Hence, in the case of the death of a
husband, leaving a widow, the net estate up
to $60,000 is completely exempt from tax.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: If he does not leave
the money to the widow-?

Hon. Mr. Thorvaldson: I think this will
become clear as I go on, and if not I will
return to it. If there are dependent children
under 21 years of age, additional exemption
of $10,000 for each child is provided. Hence,
if a husband leaves a widow and four dependent children, his estate up to $100,000 is
wholly exempt from tax.
An Hon. Senator: It might not go to the
wi

winu

Hon. Mr. Croll: I am trying to follow the
speaker, but I am losing the continuity. He
should be allowed to finish his speech.
The Hon. the Speaker: I agree. I understood some time ago that honourable senators
had decided to let the sponsor of a bill complete his explanatory statement. I have had
only a short experience here, but it is
enough for me to say that what often happens is that questions which, in the earlier
stage of a speech, honourable senators propose to ask, will be answered before the
speech is finished. So I suggest that the
agreement I have mentioned be observed,
that the preliminary statement be made by
the sponsor, and that any questions be put
afterward.
Hon. Mr. Thorvaldson: Apart from these
every
dependency,
regarding
provisions
estate having a net value of $50,000 or less
is excluded or exempt from tax. That is the
same exclusion from tax as is contained in
the old act.
I would like to refer here for a moment
to a provision which may cause confusion in
the minds of honourable senators. That is the
provision in the bill for a basic exemption
of $40,000 for every estate. I say that this
is confusing because I have just said that
every estate having a net value of $50,000 or
less is completely exempt from tax and every
estate left by a decedent husband to his
widow is exempt up to $60,000. Let me therefore explain the reference to the $40,000
basic exemption in this way. Suppose there
is an estate amounting to $100,000 net. The
law looks to see if it belonged to a married
man, namely, a decedent leaving a widow.
If so, the $60,000 exemption applies. But if
not, the $40,000 exemption applies; that is,
tax begins at $40,000. What I have tried to
make clear is that every estate of $50,000 or
less is tax exempt. But if an estate is over
$50,000 there may be circumstances at which
tax begins at $40,000. The point is that the
exemptions previously mentioned
larger
apply in the case of a small estate or in the
case of a dependency.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I do not want to ask

a question, but I wonder if the honourable
Hon. Mr. Bruni: The exemption still applies. senator would clarify the matter of the three

AUGUST 13, 1958
amounts at which taxation may occur. He
referred to $40,000, $50,000 and $60,000.
Hon. Mr. Thorvaldson: I recognize that
matters of estate taxation are somewhat confusing and technical, but I think that if the
honourable senator defers this question until
he reads the report in Hansard the written
record will make it easier to understand than
any oral explanation can. If I attempted an
explanation at this point I would merely repeat what I have said. So if I may carry on
I should like to do so.
Another basic change in the bill is the
decision to tax all property of the decedent
wherever situated in the world. In the past,
real estate situated in a foreign country and
owned by a person domiciled in Canada was
not subject to Canadian succession duty. That
is now being changed and appropriate provision is made in the act to include such
property in the estate for purposes of taxation.
I have said that an attempt has been made
to simplify the law. I think the greatest
simplification has been effected in respect to
calculation of the tax payable. In this respect
it follows the graduated system applied in the
Income Tax Act. After the application of
certain exemptions and deductions, as, for
instance, exemptions in regard to widows and
dependent children and deductions for, say,
charitable donations, the balance of the estate is taxed under a single schedule of graduated rates, irrespective of whether it goes to
a widow or to a stranger. When I refer to
graduated rates I mean, of course, that the
whole taxable estate is taxed at a certain
percentage on the first $10,000, a higher percentage on the next $10,000, and so on.
This system is similar, indeed identical in
principle, to our graduated rate of tax under
the Income Tax Act. In this regard I may say
that in the lower brackets the rate of tax
is almost always considerably lower under
the proposed act than under the present law.
As we come, however, into the higher
brackets of larger estates, the amount of tax
under the new measure is approximately
equal to the amount of duty levied under the
present Succession Duty Act.
Another difference refers to the question
of property in Canada of a person who at the
time of death is domiciled outside of Canada.
Under the present act the duty levied in
Canada is computed with reference, not only
to the value of property in Canada, but also
to such matters as the total estate value, the
bequests to individual successors, their relationship to the decedent and so forth. Under
the proposed act the tax in this case is levied
with reference only to the Canadian property,
and at a flat rate. That rate is specified at 15
per cent of the net value of the Canadian
property.

The scheme of the proposed act closely
parallels the concepts found in the income
tax law and thus has the advantage of being
well known to tax practitioners and the general public. For example, tax is payable on
the world estate of a person domiciled in Canada just as tax is payable on the world income of a person resident in Canada. Tax
is payable on the Canadian property of nondomiciled persons just as it is payable by
non-residents on their income from Canadian
sources. "Aggregate net value" and "aggregate taxable value" correspond to "net income" and "net taxable income". That is,
they correspond to those terms in the Income
Tax Act.
The general exemption and the special exemptions for widows and dependent children
and for charities follow the pattern of the
Income Tax Act, as do the rate structure and
the tax credit and tax abatement provisions.
Not all of these features embody changes in
basic concepts from those in the present succession duty law, but all of them do use very
different methods of determining the tax and
they are presented in a simpler and more
logical sequence.
Honourable senators, I suggest placing upon
Hansard two tables. The first is a rate
schedule for estate tax under the proposed
act and includes also a general summary of
the deductions provided in the bill. The
second is a schedule giving a comparison of
duty and tax payable under each act in the
case where a husband leaves one-half of his
estate to his widow and one-quarter of it to
each of his two adult children.
Hon. Senators: Agreed.
Hon. Mr. Thorvaldson: Then I would ask
that they be placed on Hansard at this point.

It has been understood that at some point the

some persons to change their wills if the act is not
to result in a frustration of their testamentary intentions. The last opportunity for this would be at
the third reading of the bill and, at Mr. McEntyre's
request, I have drafted a suggested statement which
follows. I might say that I read my original draft
to Mr. Smith before he left and the following
suggestion incorporates the changes suggested by
him:
"At this time I would like to make a statement
about the effect of the new tax in relation to existing wills. Under the Succession Duty Acts, provincial and federal, the liability for duty falls on
the successor. Many testators provide in their wills
for such duty to be paid from the mass of the
estate as a general charge, like a debt. Such wills
should require no change."

THE LATE SENATOR HAWKINS
TRIBUTES

Hon. W. M. Aseltine: Honourable senators,

this is another one of those sad occasions
which happen all too frequently in this
chamber.
When I entered the building this morning,
a little before 9 o'clock, I learned for the
first time, to my great sorrow and regret, of
the sudden demise of my dear friend and
associate the Honourable Charles G. Hawkins
of Milford-Hants, Nova Scotia. I had been
talking to him as late as 6.30 o'clock last
evening about the report of the Finance
Committee on housing. At that time he appeared to be in robust health, and we arranged for him to speak on the adoption of
the report of that committee after the debate
on the Estate Tax Bill. Life, honourable senators, is an uncertain and fleeting thing but,
in view of what I have just said, the honourable senator's death was more of a shock to me
than if he had been ill for some time.
Senator Hawkins came to this chamber in
1950, and during the last eight years endeared himself to all of us. He was a man of
exceptionally good judgment. He took a very
prominent part in the work of the Senate.
For several years he had been Chairman of
the Standing Committee on Finance, and in
that capacity he took a very prominent part
in its work. I remember that last May, when
this session opened, and before the chairmen
of the different committees were selected, I
went to him and asked if he would consider
continuing as Chairman of the Finance Committee, and he said that he would do so for
this session only. He was chosen, and he did
act in a very capable and efficient manner. I
would not want to think that the strenuous
work he did in that committee did anything
to bring about his early demise.
Senator Hawkins started out on his own,
at 18 years of age, and by hard work, diligence and ability became one of the most
prominent businessmen in the province of
Nova Scotia. He was chiefly concerned with
lumbering, but was active in other lines of
business as well. I will not take time to enumerate them but I would like to say that in

1956 he was Chairman of a Royal Commission which was set up in Nova Scotia to consider farm credits-long-term, intermediateterm and short-term farm credits-in that
province.
We all know Mrs. Hawkins, who is a very
fine woman. I am also well acquainted with
his son George who is a lawyer and who was
for some time Executive Assistant to the
Honourable Wishart McL. Robertson when he
was Leader of the Government in the Senate.
George is a fine young man and highly
thought of by everyone. Senator Hawkins
was a good friend of mine and I am going
to miss him very much. I am sure honourable
members of this chamber also will miss him
very much, as will his widow, his family, his
relatives and numerous friends.
We all wish to extend to Mrs. Hawkins and
her family our most sincere regrets at the
loss of a good husband and father; but they
will have many happy memories of him to
sustain thern in the difficult days that lie

and a prominent Canadian.
Hon. W. Ross Macdonald: Honourable
senators, I would like to join with the Leader
of the Government (Hon. Mr. Aseltine) in
expressing sympathy to Mrs. Hawkins and
the members of her family, her son, daughter,
and grandchildren, in the great loss which
has so suddenly come to them.
Senator Hawkins was especially well
qualified to sit in this chamber. He had a
distinguished background. As a young man
he worked in lumber camps, and had been
a lumberjack. Eventually, by reason of his
industry, integrity and reliability, he became
the head of a large lumber enterprise. His
life history should be recorded in more
detail, for it would be an inspiration to all
young Canadians to strive to establish for
themselves a place in this country and to
contribute to the welfare of their fellow
citizens. I have said that Senator Hawkins
was noted for his industry. No member of
this house worked more intensely than he
did: he was here every morning at eight
o'clock and commenced his tasks early in
the day, and he did not leave this building
until they were accomplished. His integrity
was beyond question; he was a man of whom
it could be truly said that his word was as
good as his bond.
Senator Hawkins was a reliable man. When
he said he would undertake a task we knew
he would do so. If be were asked to assume
a responsibility, he would assume it and we
knew that he would carry out his duties to
the best of his ability.
I stated that as a young man Senator
Hawkins started to work in lumber camps.

AUGUST 14, 1958
I think some of his accomplishments, as set
forth in the Canadian Parliamentary Guide,
wherein he is described as a lumberman,
should appear on the records of this bouse.
He was president of the Riversdale Lumber,
Limited; a partner in Hawkins & Zwicker;
a director of Minas Basin Pulp & Power
Company, Limited; a director of Fairey Aviation of Canada Limited; a member of the
Board of Governors of University King's
College; a director of Nova Scotia Trust
Company; a director of Canada Forestry
Association; a director and past-president of
the Nova Scotia Forest Products Association;
a director and past-president of the Maritime
Lumber Bureau; a director of the Canadian
Lumbermen's Association; a member of the
Nova Scotia Marketing Board; and a member
of Gypsum Lime and Alabastine, Canada
Limited. I arn sure honourable senators will
agreee with me that Senator Hawkins led
a very active life. His abilities were recognized by the University King's College,
which conferred upon him the honorary
degree of Doctor of Civil Laws.
Honourable senators, we have lost a man
who served his country well. Yesterday he
was in the full bloom of health, in the
vigour of manhood. Today he is with us no
longer.

with a wonderful understanding and a remarkably sympathetic feeling for the needs
of others. To me his passing will mean a
real loss.
In the book Postscript ta Adventure the
late Dr. Charles W. Gordon, better known ta
our western senators, particularly those from
Winnipeg, as Ralph Connor, started to write
a tribute ta his frîend Dr. Clarence MacKinnon, of Pine Hill Theological College, Halifax,
who had just passed ta the Great Beyond.
Dr. Gardon, who was ill and weak at the
time, underwent an operatian the next day
and the tribute was neyer completed.
It
was the last thing that Ralph Connor wrote,
and I arn using thoughts there expressed as
a tribute ta the late Senator Hawkins. Part
of the tribute reads:
A common sorrow, a common loas, dearly loved

had a keen mind and a fine sense of sympathy and appreciation of the principles of
justice. I speak, I am sure, for all members
of that committee, as well as for myself,
in saying that his place there can scarcely
be filled from the membership of this house
as it now stands. His wisdom, his willingness, his ability and his keenness of mind
will be hard to duplicate, if not impossible.
We of the Divorce Committee do regret his
passing, not only because we have lost a
valued friend and colleague, but because his
place will be so hard to fill.
On behalf of the members of my committee
I wish to join with other honourable senators in extending our fullest sympathy to
his widow and family.
Hon. Wishart McL. Robertson: Honourable
senators, in the passing of Senator Hawkins
Canada has lost an outstanding public figure;
Nova Scotia, one of her most prominent
citizens; the Senate, one of its most diligent
and useful members; and I, personally, have
lost my best friend.
From his earliest days, it was inevitable
that his great energy and qualities of mind
and heart should have been attended by
marked success in the fields of business and
industry, yet he never lost the common touch.
He was a wise counsellor and government,
business and individuals alike sought his
counsel. He had a deep sense of responsibility
and public spirit. He gave unsparingly of his
great talents for the benefit of all measures
and activities affecting the public weal.
When, eight years ago, he was summoned
to the Senate he brought to this chamber
all of the fine qualities that had made him
so outstanding in his native province. I need
hardly remind honourable senators of his
faithful attendance at our gatherings, of the
keenness with which he appraised all matters coming before us, of the skill he displayed in presiding over the meetings of the
Standing Committee on Finance. He had
attained the allotted span of three score
years and ten, and it was characteristic of
his whole life of activity that he presented
his report on the Central Mortgage and
Housing Corporation a day or two ago. But
for his untimely passing, he might well have
been moving adoption of that report at this
very minute.
There is little I can say of sympathy to his
widow and children in their great bereavement. To his widow may I say that, in the
passing of her husband, we have lost a most
highly respected and esteemed colleague; and,
to his son and daughter and their families,
that his name will long be remembered and
revered by Nova Scotians of all walks of

life, as one of her most gifted and patriotic
sons.
For my part I have lost my best friend.
Our friendship has been long and intimate.
I, too, frequently sought his advice, always
cheerfully given. Many long hours of pleasant
and happy association are now only a memory. But I pay my personal tribute to a great
character, a loyal friend and a happy companion. I shall miss him more than I can say.
(Translation):
Hon. Cyrille Vaillancourt: Honourable senators, it seems fitting that a French voice
should join with all those who have just expressed their condolences over the sudden
demise of our colleague.
Yesterday, at the end of the sitting, he
adjourned the debate on the report which
he had tabled in this chamber a few days
ago.
I have known Senator Hawkins during the
eight years he spent in the Senate. He was
fair, generous, magnanimous and devoted to
duty. He never accepted any task without
being sure that he could do it and especially
that it would be of use to his fellow citizens.
Yesterday, I sent a copy of the Finance
Committee's report on the Central Mortgage
and Housing Corporation to the General Manager of our housing co-operative. I told him
that if he had any suggestion to make in
connection with the report, Senator Hawkins
would support him. This morning, when I
arrived at the office, I was told of the demise
of Senator Hawkins.
I feel very deeply the loss of a great champion of co-operatives. But I trust that the
spirit which inspired him will survive. The
best tribute to the departed is to keep their
memory graven in our hearts and minds.
Senator Hawkins was an example of
straightforwardness, of faithfulness and of
hard work. After hearing the tributes just
made, I hope that we will always remember
Senator Hawkins and that we will endeavour
to follow the example he set before us of
trustworthiness and of willingness to serve
our fellow citizens and our country.
I would like to offer my most sincere condolences to Mrs. Hawkins and to her children.
May they be comforted by the thought that
greater glory awaits us in the Great Beyond
that can be found in our short stay on earth.

extensive knowledge of medicine and mankind, and his sympathetie nature and keen
mind have been a real help in carrying out
the work of the committee. I express the hope,
on behalf of all of us, that his strength will
increase and that he will be with us again
at the next session.
The absence of these two members, and now
of our dear friend who has just left us, Senator Hawkins, presents a real difficulty. The
absence of the two members I first mentioned created a considerable difficulty in the
carrying on of our work during the present
session. It was only recently I warned the
house and the Government that we simply
must have new appointments to the committee
next session, appointments of persons who
will realize the responsibility that the whole
house has, and not any one person, in carrying on the work of this committee day by
day, not in spurts. No one is exempt from that
responsibility; it rests on the shoulders of all
members of this house. I am sure that after
this warning we will meet the committee's
requirements next session.
Honourable senators, perhaps I would not
be charged with tooting our horn too much
when I say that on account of its membership
the Divorce Committee has been a remarkable
body. I justify this statement by saying
that in the last five years, during which time
I have presided over the committee, we have
tried something in the order of 2,000 cases.
I am proud to be able to say that in not one
single instance have we divided: in every case
we have made a unanimous report. That is
very remarkable. It has not been due to
any pressure, or indeed any attempt, to bring
about unanimity. It has been due merely
to the fact that we have had a common-sense
and well-informed committee who knew the
rules and knew their work, and whose
thoughts consequently have run together.
On no occasion has any member been asked
or urged, or even had it suggested to him, to
join with the majority in order to make a
unanimous report. Yet, I repeat we have
made a unanimous decision in every one of
these 2,000 cases. I should add that not only
have we been unanimous in our reports to
this house, but our subcommittees, in their
reports to the general committee, have never
yet brought in a divided report.
Honourable senators, there is one point
I would like to deal with, because it has
been discussed here several times. My honourable friend from De la Durantaye (Hon.
Mr. Pouliot) recently referred to the so-called
"ditto" cases. He had in mind the common
understanding and impression which so many
people have as to the kind of cases that come
before us. The general thought is that the

respondent and co-respondent go to a hotel
room, and that two professional witnesses,
who are there to see what happens, later
present the story to us. Knowing that this
is not true in the main, I had some statisties
prepared with regard to the so-called hotel
cases. Incidentally, when I say "hotel" I
include the motel, the rooming-house and
similar accommodation. In other words, the
hotel cases are those where the room in the
hotel, motel, rooming-house or what-haveyou has been obtained for the specific purpose
of the act in question. These are outside
what I might describe as the private-dwelling
cases, where the alleged act has been committed in private houses, apartments or
similar accommodation which is the normal
abode of one or both parties. Here is the
count for this session. Of 314 cases which
we examined in order to get this information
-nearly
all the cases we tried-79 were
hotel cases and 235 were private-dwelling
cases. So roughly 25 per cent of the cases
that came before us were these hotel cases.
I think it should be borne in mind by our
fellow members that we do not spend our
time in trying miserable routine cases where
perhaps the evidence presented to us has
been manufactured.
In this connection, let me say a word in defence of the professional witnesses. It is easy
to malign these men but I resent that attitude. In all the years I have sat on the committee we have had no reason to suspect
the bona fides of these professional witnesses.
My own thought at the moment is that they
are perhaps more reliable than the run of
ordinary witnesses who come before us. I
say that because if at any time one of these
men gave us good reason to suspect that he
was making up evidence, not telling the
truth or in any way trying to mislead us,
he would no longer be acceptable as a witness
before our committee. These men are doing
this work day after day, and they come
before us continuously and expect to do so
session after session. I have in mind a professional witness who was convicted of some
offence of this nature, and he came before us
on a case in a subsequent session. I made
the report on the case, with the reservation
that it did not depend at all upon the evidence of that particular man, which was
completely disregarded. He came to see me
later on and wanted to know if we could not
put up with him in some way-if he could
not continue in the work, because it was his
profession. I said to him: "I don't see how I
can do anything, or how this committee can
do anything. So far as we are concerned, you
are all through". He never appeared before
the committee again. Every one of these professional witnesses is subject to exactly the

AUGUST 14, 1958

same policy. If we ever find one of them
making a false report, his usefulness before
the committee will be at an end. In all my
experience I have had very little reason to
suspect that manufactured cases were being
brought before us.
Honourable senators, may I now read the
formal report made by me on behalf of all
the members of the committee:
The Standing Committee on Divorce make their
331st report, as follows:
For the present session of Parliament 424 petitions
for bills of divorce were presented to the Senate
and dealt with by the Standing Committee on
Divorce, as follows:
Petitions heard and recommended ......
319
Petitions heard and rejected ..............
6
Petitions withdrawn .......................
4
Petitions not disposed of ..................
95
(Last session 134 cases remained undisposed
of)

T otal

.......................................

424

I may say it is usual for a certain number
of cases to remain undisposed of at the close
of every session. In this instance, as in others,
we have tried every case that was ready to
be tried, and which we were asked to try.
The remaining ones which must go over to
the next session are those in which the petitioners have not come forward or are not in
a position to be heard because they have not
completed the routine that is required to be
completed before the actual hearing.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Do such petitioners
lose their deposit?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: No. Their cases can be
transferred to the next session without any
question as to the deposit.
The report continues:
Of the petitions recommended, 312 were from
petitioners domiciled in the province of Quebec
and 7 were from petitioners domiciled in the
province of Newfoundland.
0f the 312 petitioners domiciled in the province
of Quebec, 104 were husbands and 208 were wives.

Of the 7 petitioners domiciled in the province
of Newfoundland, 4 were husbands and 3 were
wives.

Of the petitions heard, 12 were opposed at
the hearing.
In that connection-and I see my seatmate, the Honourable Senator Croll, is not
here-I would like to pay him a compliment,
as I did in presenting the last report, for
volunteering to act as chairman of the committee that heard a number of these contested
cases. I think he heard about 8 of the 12
opposed cases. The Honourable Senator
Farris, as chairman, heard one, and I, as
chairman, heard two or three. Senator Croll's
generosity in taking over these trying and
troublesome cases is really worth mentioning; he did it for the very purpose of relieving me of that burden, which was rather
too much for me to carry.
The main or general committee met 34 times
during the session on 34 separate days. The
general committee divided into subcommittees for
the hearing of evidence in support of petitions,
and these subcommittees held 84 meetings.
In 7 cases, where the petitioner pleaded hardship
on account of straitened circumstances in respect
to the payment of the full parliamentary fee, the
committee recommended a partial remission.
The fees oaid to Parliament for bills of divorce
heard and recommended during the present session
amounted to $66.215.
Assuming that ail bills of divorce recommended
by the committee, now in various stages before
Parliament, receive the royal assent, the comparison of dissolutions of marriage granted by
Parliament in the last ten sessions is as follows:1950 ..................................

They are: 15 in 1953, 8 in 1954, 7 in 1955,

balance of about $25,000 or $30,000-I have

not worked it out-above cost.
Now, I want to say a word, and I feel I
must do it, about the faithful and efficient
contributions in work by our staff. Honourable senators who do not sit on the commit-

tee or are not very familiar with its work
will perhaps not realize how much work
the staff does in preparing cases and getting
them ready for hearing. There is the publication of the notices in the various papers and
so on, the payment of fees, the reading of
the petition in order to see that it complies
with the requirements, and so on; and later

on there is the actual calling of these cases
and the constant

discussion with

the sol-

licitors in charge in bringing them to trial

AUGUST 14, 1958
at certain times. There is a vast amount of
detail involved, and the preparation and conclusion of 300 cases and more in one session
is a task of unbelievable detail.
There is no place in this work for slovenliness or inaccuracy. The work must be well
done and it has been. Under the direction of
Mr. Armstrong, chief of the Committees
Branch, the work has been done with meticulous care. The general management and the
calling of these cases, the handling of them
prior to hearing afterwards, has fallen upon
the shoulders of Mr. John Hinds, a careful
and well-informed officer of this bouse. I pay
tribute to them both.
I think all the members of the Divorce
Committee will join with me in paying tribute
to the three registrars or clerks of the court.
Hon. Mr. Howard: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: I thank you for that
"Hear, hear".
They exhibit intelligence, courtesy, faithfulness and good nature, and they have
carried on this work so smoothly and well
that that is perhaps one of the reasons why
we are always unanimous in our findings,
for we are under no tension. Those three men
are Mr. J. D. MacDonald, Mr. A. Fortier and
Mr. G. Lemire. There are others on our staff
who are not so much in evidence as the three
registrars but whose work nevertheless is
important, and it also has been well done.
One is always tempted both in this house
and in the committees to take for granted
the work done by the Hansard staff under
Mr. Lake. In the Divorce Committee it is
particularly noticeable to those who understand what is going on. The reporting service is unobtrusive and, according to my
memory at the moment, has never been
called into question. Here in the bouse we
sometimes ask for a correction to be made
in the record, but I cannot remember a
single case where anyone bas asked for a
correction in the records of this committee.
You may say the work passes unobserved,
but it does not. These reports go out to
the parties interested, and were they not
accurate we would hear about it, I can
assure you. For that excellent work, painstaking and requiring a considerable amount
of industry, I would like to pay tribute to
Mr. Hagen, Mr. Shelton, Mr. Hubbard, Mr.
Lemire, Mr. Crockett and Mr. Lawrence,
all of whom attended our sittings.
One further word and I shall be through.
I wish to thank the Leader of the Government (Hon. Mr. Aseltine), the Leader of the
Opposition (Hon. Mr. Macdonald) and many
other members of this house who have paid
tribute to the industry which the committee

bas exhibited, and who have spoken so
kindly on so many occasions of the work
we have done. I assure you, my honourable
colleagues, that your approval has been a
real factor in the carrying out of this work.
Hon. W. M. Aselline: Honourable senators,
I feel I should say a word at this time
because I know something of the work of
the Standing Committee on Divorce, having
been a member of that committee for more
than 20 years, and a chairman of it for
longer than I care to remember, in which
time I had something to do with the disposal of some 4,000 cases of the kind the
present honourable chairman has referred to
this afternoon.
May I say that we appreciate very much
having a man of his ability, qualifications
and energy as the chairman of the committee.
I for one do not know how we would get
along without him. I hope that he will find
it convenient to carry on again next session
and for longer than that if Parliament is
still required to dispose of divorces. I also
join with the honourable chairman in thanking the staff of the Reporting Branch, the
staff of the Committees Branch, and all the
other persons he has mentioned, for the
diligent and faithful work they have done,
and for the assistance which they have
rendered the chairman, the committee and
Parliament as a whole.
Hon. W. Ross Macdonald: Honourable
senators, the Chairman of the Divorce Committee has presented a most complete report
on the work of the committee this session,
and he has related that work to the granting
of divorces by the courts throughout the provinces of Canada. His report is, I am sure,
a very valuable one, and the bouse is indebted to him for having given this
information.
I join with the Leader of the Government
in commending the chairman and the members of his committee for the work they
have done. It is not an easy task to be a
member of the Divorce Committee. I take
this opportunity to point out to the bouse
that this committee sits five days a week;
when many of us leave on Thursday night
to go to our homes, not to return until
Tuesday, the members of the Divorce Committee stay behind and sit on Friday, and
again on Monday and Tuesday. They surely
do their share of the work of the Senate, and
we should all be very grateful to them. They
do a necessary work, which will have to be
done until, if ever, there is a change in the
procedure for the hearing of applications for
divorce from the provinces of Quebec and
Newfoundland. The number is not lessening, and it is not likely to lessen in future

SENATE

years; but we know we have a competent
chairman and an able committee to carry on
that work, and I congratulate them.

ESTATE

TAX

BILL

SECOND READING

The Senate resumed from yesterday the
adjourned debate on the motion of Hon. Mr.
Thorvaldson for the second reading of Bill
C-37, respecting the taxation of estates.

AUGUST 14, 1958
Hon. Salier A. Hayden: Honourable senators, the bill before us is a very important
piece of legislation, as, indeed, any statute
imposing a tax would be, and particularly
one of this kind, because of its far-reaching
effect, entering as it does, directly or indirectly, into the lives and operations of most
people, affecting them in a rather personal
way, in respect of the estates which remain
after satisfying all the demands of the cost
of living and the infinite variety of taxes
to which people are subject during their lifetime. So when a man who has been able to
survive the onslaught of all the arms which
reach out for a share of his earnings passes
on, there remains, depending on the amount
he has left, a problern in more or less degree,
to which those who survive him have to give
attention. And when I look at this tax, which
in its nature is a capital levy on a great number of people, I find it difficult to appreciate
why, when testators have conducted themselves in compliance with the law and have
paid all the carrying charges of living in this
country, what comes to them by way of savings must undergo a further reduction by
way of a well-defined and usually substantial
percentage thereof in the interests of the
Government and the Canadian people in
general.
However, there it is, and since it provides
a source from which fairly substantial
amounts of money can be expected to flow
each year, it seems idle to speculate on the
possibility that within the foreseeable future
succession duties or estate taxes will be
abandoned
by
provincial
and federal
authorities.
Before turning to some aspects of the bill,
upon which I intend to speak for a few
minutes, I want to acknowledge the valuable
contribution which the sponsor of the bill
(Hon. Mr. Thorvaldson) made yesterday in
dealing with some of its main features. I
hasten to suggest, however, that when in his
opening remarks be stated that the law as
contemplated in this bill is designed to overcome as far as possible features of the present
legislation which seem unfair or severe, or
impose in convenience on the taxpayer, I
cannot admit that the millennium, taxationwise, has been reached, that all those features
which may be regarded as constituting unfairness, severity and inconvenience, have
been removed, and that we have here an
ideal bill in its most acceptable form. Should
any honourable senator have such an idea, I
believe be will soon be convinced that it is
an illusion, because in some respects, in my
view, the absence of desirable changes is
continuing a situation which, certainly in respect of the valuation procedure, is completely unrealistic. In fact, I do not believe

that, wherever one searched, one could find
a more fantastic, fanciful and fictional
formula for valuing an estate than the one
you find in this bill.
Having said that, there are one or two
premises I want to state before I proceed
with the several points to which I intend to
address my remarks. We must not assume,
because on the right-hand page of the bill
the words "no change", referring to some section of the present act, are inserted, that one
may immediately pass on without reading the
clause. My concept of a bill of this kind is
that a new bill is before us. The fact that
some condition in the present law is perpetuated is no reason why we should take it
for granted. We should consider it in the
same sense and with the same manner of approach as we would give to any other elements of the bill.
That brings me to the first point I want to
make. From the explanation given by the
sponsor yesterday it would appear that, so
far as exemptions and taxation are concerned,
the bill proceeds on a basis which is purely
impersonal. I have in mind the matter of
degrees of consanguinity, on which the tables
in the present statute are based, where more
consideration is given to closer relationships,
and the degree of consideration is reduced
as one moves further along the line of
I may be olddegrees of relationship.
fashioned, but I am a little concerned when
I look at a question which affects the family,
the continuity of family interests and family
estates, and the position of family assets from
generation to generation. I cannot feel impersonal on the subject. I feel that there
must be some method by which the same
result could have been achieved by recognizing the principle of degrees of consanguinity and blood relationship, and granting
more concessions on rates as they apply to
close relatives such as the wife and the
immediate family, and making up for whatever increase is granted there by taking or
levying higher rates in relation to the gifts
which are made to those further out along
the line. I am not alone in having that
approach to the question. I know that in
the statute law of Ontario, and certainly in
some of the other provinces, it is provided
that if a person dies without leaving a will
the law writes a will for him, and the law
writing that will for him provides a basis
for the distribution of the estate, and recognizes very clearly this matter of blood
relationship and degrees of consanguinity,
by providing for the distribution in certain
percentages to the widow and the children,
with rates of tax which recognize that closer
relationship. If there are no persons in this
category to receive benefits, and distribution

SENATE

of the benefits is made in an area which is
farther out, containing no persons in that
situation of close relationship, the present
law imposes a higher rate of tax. To me
that seems reasonable and understanding and
is not getting away from just the little touch
of humanity that we should try to get into
a taxing statute. I would have felt much
better had that principle been retained in this
statute.
It may be said that other countries are imposing taxes on a percentage basis as is
proposed here. I have not made any particular study of the matter, but I think you will
find, for instance, that the United States
statute recognizes in some greater degree the
marital aspect in the accumulation of property which subsequently becomes an estate.
In that way they give recognition to close
degrees of relationship before they come
down to the business of taxing.
Hon Mr. Bouffard: And the tax is much
lower.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: Yes.

Having said that I do not know what more
I can say on the point. The Government
has presented us with a bill which proceeds
on a certain basis or principle for imposing
tax. It does not recognize at all the question
of such personal relationships. There may be
a widow and there may be childrenHon. Mr. Thorvaldson: Those things are
recognized in this act.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: I am glad my honourable
friend made that interruption. I was going
to say something later on about the point,
but I might as well do so now. My honourable
friend says that the bill does recognize these
people. All the bill provides in this respect
is that if a man dies and leaves a widow
there is an exemption of $60,000; in other
words, $60,000 of the estate that he leaves is
not taxed. The law does not say that he
has to leave the $60,000 to his widow. It
merely provides for this exemption because
he has a spouse who survives him. The law
might just as well provide for an exemption
of $60,000 if the Prime Minister of Canada,
say, has red hair, and for an exemption of
only $40,000 if he hasn't got red hair.
The point I am trying to emphasize is just
how impersonal the approach to all this bas
become. Let us go a little further. When the
position is reversed and a deceased wife
leaves an estate, the exemption will be
$60,000 if the surviving husband is infirm
and if there is at least one child under 21,
or one child over 21 who is infirm and who
is dependent on the surviving husband or
wife or on both of them at the time of the
wife's death. If that is not impersonal I

don't know what is. It does not proceed on
the basis that any part of the estate bas to
be left to an infirm husband or infirm child
under or over 21; but simply on the basis
that there is a husband who is infirm.
The definition of "infirm", in section 58,
presents some interesting aspects too. According to this definition an inflrm person is
one who is incapable ordinarily of pursuing
any substantially gainful occupation. I don't
suppose it would be much of a problem to
reach a conclusion with respect to a child
under 21. All I can say is that we should be
thankful that the word "substantially"
precedes the words "gainful occupation".
But what do the words "incapable ordinarily
of pursuing any substantially gainful occupation" mean? Do they mean incapable in the
ordinary way of pursuing some substantially
gainful occupation as a matter of day-to-day
application by a person to some particular
duty or task? What of a situation where a
professionally trained man becomes incapacitated to the extent that he cannot
follow his ordinary occupation any longer
but is able to carry out the duties of an
attendant in a cloak room or something of
that kind? Does it mean that he is not infirm
for the purposes of this section? There is
some saving, of course, in having the word
"substantially" in the clause, and for that I
am very grateful. However, it seems to me
there was a very simple way, if any thought
had been given to this section, of dealing with
this situation.
The same exemption should have been provided in the case of a husband surviving his
wife as in the case of a wife surviving her
husband. I don't know why there should be
any difference. The bill could also provide
a special exemption if at the date of death the
surviving husband or surviving wife was infirm, or if there was an infirm child that was
dependent. It would seem to me that this
would be the human, natural and reasonable
way of dealing with this phase of the law.
In the face of these considerations the sponsor
of the bill still tells me the statute recognizes
degrees of consanguinity. All I can say is
that it is the strangest, oddest and most unusual kind of recognition I have ever heard of.
Hon. Mr. Thorvaldson: I did not say that
it recognized degrees of consanguinity. It
doesn't do that, but it does recognize dependent interest.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: All I say is that it makes
use of the wife, the husband and the infirm
child solely as a measuring stick to determine
whether something shall be this, that or the
other thing. If that is exercising any personality or humanity touch, then my conception
of it is completely wrong.

AUGUST 14, 1958
I come now to several aspects of the bill
with which I wish to deal. The first one is
this. Something has been said about the provincial credit which this bill continues. What
is meant by a provincial credit? The federal
authority taxes an estate, and the provincial
authority-now Ontario and Quebec-also tax
the same estate. Under the existing law there
is an abatement in the federal tax to the
extent of 50 per cent of the tax that relates
to the property taxed in Ontario or Quebec.
So it is based on the provincial taxes paid.
Under the concept of the bill there are two
categories of taxpayers at large. In one group
are the persons domiciled in Canada at the
time of death, and in the other group are
persons who are not domiciled in Canada at
the time of death. The first group is covered
in Part I of the bill and the second group in
Part II of the bill. When people domiciled in
Canada die, there arises the problem of taxation both federally and provincially. So far
as a tax credit is concerned, the bill now
provides that such a person's estate in Ontario
or Quebec is entitled to a credit or abatement
of 50 per cent of the tax payable in respect
of property of that person dying situate in
Ontario or Quebec. What does that mean? It
means that less than 50 per cent abatement
measured in terms of provincial tax is granted,
for the reason that if a person in Ontario has
property in Alberta, Saskatchewan and British
Columbia or Prince Edward Island, and it
comes into the Ontario taxation because there
is a transmission of that property to some
person living in Ontario, and then Ontario
taxes, but the 50 per cent exemption obtainable under this bill does not extend to include
any of the taxes payable because of the
transmission in Ontario of property situate in
another province. Therefore the federal
authority gives less than 50 per cent credit
and less than is given now. I find it difficult
to understand this, for when we come to Part
II, which deals with the estates of nondomiciled persons, the 50 per cent exemption
or abatement is based on the property on
which provincialb taxes are paid.
Now, if you can do it for a non-domiciled
person, I would like to know what good
reason there is for not proceeding on the
sarme basis for a domiciled person. So much
in relation to that aspect of the matter. If
there is going to be a change in the law I
suggest that it should not be a change which
has the possible effect in some cases of lowering the amount of the exemption-abatement
in taxes, is a better expression-and imposing
a sum total, a larger amount of tax, than
would be imposed under the present legislation.
There is another matter to which I wish to
.call attention. The language of the bill,

in section 9, deals with a "prescribed province"; that is, this allowance or abatement is
in relation to property that is situate in a
prescribed province at the date of death of
a person domiciled in Ontario. Then if you
go to the definition section you will find that
the word "prescribed" is something that is
prescribed by the Minister. If you look at the
explanatory note on the right-hand side of
the page, of course, they tell you that this is
intended to apply to the provinces which
have not vacated the field of succession duty
under the tax rental agreements. But I say
there is a looseness there, because nowhere
in the statute is there prescribed how you
determine what is a prescribed province,
other than that it is at the discretion of the
minister. The section says you are entitled to
the abatement of 50 per cent in relation to
property situate in a prescribed province at
the date of death of a person domiciled in
Ontario; and it says what "prescribed"
means, and who prescribes; but as to how
he prescribes, and to what extent, the statute
does not say anything. Surely, if the statute
is going to be complete there should be some
definition or someHon. Mr. Bruni: They can also prescribe
by regulation.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: That is right, but what
I say is that if you can prescribe by regulation how do you know to what extent? What
rules are going to govern?
The second item I wish to deal with is tied
up into the question of taxation of insurance
policies, superannuation, pensions, death benefits, voluntary payments on and after
death. I want to consider those in a group
and to indicate just what the state of the
law is. I think it is time we had a very
serious look at the whole situation so far as
the taxation of pensions is concerned. So far
as insurance is concerned, of course, the
ordinary course is that if a person who dies
has a policy on his life which is payable
to his estate or his wife, the proceeds are
brought into the estate. It is difficult to
raise an objection to that. Or if he has a
policy payable to a trustee and the trustee
has certain directions as to how to dispose
of the money at any time during the lifetime of this man who subsequently dies, and
the deceased could in his lifetime alter the
terms of that trust, again it is difficult to put
forward any basis of sound reasoning that
is not part of a man's estate at the time
of his death.

Also, under the present law in the case
of personal corporations, if a personal corporation carries insurance on the life of the
chief shareholder, then whether the proceeds

SENATE
are payable to the shareholder or to the
zorporation or payable in any other manner, for purposes of arriving at the amount
of the estate the proceeds of the policy are
brought into the estate. Frankly, I would
have difficulty in trying to raise a solid
argument that would satisfy me that those
proceeds should not go into the estate. But
the bill goes further and provides that where
a policy of insurance is taken out on the
life of a man by a company that is controlled
by him-not a personal corporation, but by
a company that is controlled by him; and
"control" is defined as meaning a company
that is controlled-the man himself does
not have to hold a majority of the shares
so long as lie and persons related by blood,
by marriage or adoption, or by any other
method of agreement hold in all a majority
of the shares; and in those circumstances
if that company takes out a policy of insurance and the proceeds are payable to the
spouse or to the child of this chief shareholder, it forms part of the assets of the
estate. I have a little more difficulty in accepting that. So long as it is a personal
corporation I have no difficulty. But when I
go further and envisage under a controlled
company, that these shareholders may not
be speaking acquaintances, and, secondly,
that the control may subsist only because
they have 51 per cent, and it is manufacturing business, in which 49 per cent is held
by other people, and it may be to their
interest, too that this insurance should be
provided, I can make a little better argument for excluding all the proceeds of such
a policy where a controlled company is not
a personal corporation.
The case where I think I could make a
solid argument is the next one, where you
have such a controlled company, and the
policy of insurance is taken out on the life
of the chief shareholder, who may not be
the majority shareholder himself, and the
proceeds of the policy are payable to the
company itself, not to his estate, not to his
widow, not to his children, but payable to
the company itself and the proceeds are to
be taken into the assets of the estate.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: That is, to the man
who paid the premiums?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: And the company has
paid the premium. The only connection of
the company with this man is that lie himself may be the majority shareholder, or lie
or his blood relatives, or some relatives by
marriage or by adoption, or by some other
agreement, may control the company to the
extent of 51 per cent. Then it says those
proceeds come into the estate. Fortunately,
they put a limitation on it which takes some

of the sting out, and the limitation is this,
that they say that in those circumstances
you take the profits of the business of that
company for the year in which the man
died, and for the four preceding years, and
you deduct from that the losses and you
arrive at a figure-it may be $200,000 or
$500,000, whatever it is-and then you look
at the amount of the insurance. If the
amount of the total profits less the losses
is greater than the amount of the insurance,
then there is nothing to bring into the man's
estate.
In other words, they adopt that
formula to demonstrate that the company
had an insurable interest. But my concept
of the insurable interest of a company does
not depend upon that result being achieved,
because the man may over a period of years
have made very substantial contributions to
the company, which may have fallen on evil
days. Therefore, I say that by the broadening of the definition, getting away and moving much farther out than in the field of
personal corporation, I have difficulty in
following and accepting this principle of
taxation of the proceeds of such insurance.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: What are the provisions under the present act with respect to
those matters?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: It only relates to proceeds of a personal corporation. In other
words, personal corporations as we ordinarily
understand them.
Hon. Mr. Bruni: The present act does not
refer to controlled corporations, I understand?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: No, it refers to personal
corporations.
Now, moving on from that, since the question of pensions and death benefits enters
into this picture, I should like to say something about that. If this becomes law, any
man who may find himself in the position
where lie or his relatives have as much as
51 per cent of the stock of a company would
be very, very smart if he màde a present of
1 per cent to a complete stranger.
Hon. Mr. Howard: Yes.
Hon. Mr. Hayden:
would not apply.

Then the provision

Hon. Mr. Thorvaldson: But in doing so lie
would lose control of his company, would lie
not, and that might be important?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: He would not lose effective control by reason of the 1 per cent, I
would say. I do not think that would be a
serious trouble at all.
The real point in all this, I think, is the
provisions in relation to pensions under the

AUGUST 14, 1958
present law and as perpetuated in this bill
under section 3 (1) (k), which says:
-any

superannuation, pension or death benefit-

The words "death benefit" are new.
-payable
or granted
(i) out of or under any fund or plan established
for the payment of superannuation, pension or
death benefits to recipients, or
(ii) out of the revenue of Her Majesty in right
of Canada or a province or under or subject to
any act of the Parliament of Canada or of the
legislature of a province,
on or after the death of the deceased in respect
of such death.

The pension that accrues to the widow of
a civil service employee, to the widow of a
judge, to the widow of an employee of a
manufacturing company, that whole range of
pensions is valued as determined by a method
of capitalizing the value. They get out their
mortality tables in that strictly impersonal
way and they will take the age of the widow
who may be entitled to the pension and they
determine her life expectancy, they take the
amount of the pension and they capitalize
that, I think at 4 per cent interest, and they
say that is the capital value of the pension.
That amount is then brought into the estate
as an asset of the estate, increasing the
capital value of the estate and therefore, if
the estate is taxable, increasing the rate of
duty or tax payable on the estate.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Do they not do that now?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: Yes. But what I said
earlier, Senator, was that in my view this
is one of the two most important aspects of
this bill and of the present law. I said
before and I repeat, that whether the pensions
are built up over a lifetime of contribution
by a deceased person and by a corporation
for which he is working or whether there is
a voluntary payment by the employer after
the employee's death, that whole field should
be examined at this time. My reason for
saying this is that it appears in the ordinary
way to be the most available and possibly
the only way in which people in ordinary
circumstances can assure themselves that
if and when they pass on there is something
there in the way of income for the widow
after their decease, and by imposing this
capitalized value and making it an asset
of the estate, if the man leaves any other
assets they may be subject to estate tax, imposing very heavy burdens.
Now, honourable senators, that is my approach, that is why I am developing the
point. As I said in the beginning, I am not
concerned that that is the present law. We
are reviewing what shall be the future law
in Canada in relation to federal inheritance
taxation, and I say that at this time we
should look at this field because it is an

important field.

Now, in addition to these

pensions being valued and taken into the
assets of the estate there is also this provision in section 3 (1)(i) of the bill, on page
3, dealing with the property that is included
when computing the aggregate net value
of an estate:
-property disposed of by any person on or after the
death of the deceased (i) under any disposition
made voluntarily in recognition of services rendered
by the deceased as an employee of that person or
as an employee of any other person, or (ii) under
the terms of any agreement made by the deceased
for valuable consideration given by him providing
for the disposition of such property on or after
his death

. . . etc.,

and so forth.

What that means is that even in the case
where an employer may after the death of
his employee say, "This man has been a
faithful employee for a great many years and
I am going to make a special grant or confer
pension"-and, honourable senators, there are
a great number of places in industry where a
pension plan is not available to the employees
or where the pensions are not very great and
the employer decides he is going to supplement that-well, if he supplements that,
under this section it is a payment which
must be valued and capitalized and brought
into the assets of the estate.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Is that new?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: That is not new, no.
The only phase of these two sections is the
question of death benefits.
Now, here is what I have to say on this
subject: so far as valuation is concerned, and
it must necessarily come into what I am
saying about pensions, I say that the basis
of capitalizing and determining the value as
I have indicated is completely unreal and
is completely unfair. And let me tell you
why: because, first of all, as that payment
goes out each year thereafter to the widow
it is subject to income tax. Why should there
be capitalized in the value of a pension the
element of tax that is charged against that
in each year in which the widow survives
and receives a pension? I cannot appreciate
it as being of any benefit to her or as having
been of any benefit to the deceased. The only
explanation that was given in the other place
when this question was raised was: Well, this
is a capital tax which is irnposed once and
for all, and income tax is something entirely
different, so let us not mix the two of them.
But I say the two of them are mixed, they
are inevitably and inextricably mixed in that
amount of pension, and when you take a
widow's pension which is usually related in
some percentage to what the husband would
be entitled to getHon. Mr. Bruni: The widow usually receives one-half of her husband's pension.

SENATE
Hon. Mr. Hayden: Then if there are any
other assets it does not take a very big pension, especially if the widow happens to be
relatively young and has quite a life expectancy, to capitalize into a very substantial
amount of money. I say the whole concept
of it in the circumstances in which we now
live is completely wrong. We have been encouraging the creation of pension plans under
our income tax law, we have encouraged
the setting up of pensions, and even recently
in the last year or so we permitted a broader
scope for pensions whereby a self-employed
person can create a scheme of pension for
himself, and we permit deductions from income, and the basis of income tax is that
when that money is paid out in the form
of pension benefits they take their place in
the category of income and are subject to tax
in the ordinary way.
This scheme of pensions we have encouraged, and it is a form of thrift that is highly
commended and is highly desirable, people
being thrifty and providing for themselves
rather than saying, "We are going to spend
as we go and spend ourselves and our country
into prosperity", as I have heard it stated in
this chamber once or twice in the last year,
"and then at the end of the road whatever
will be, will be." Surely as against those
two concepts there is no question of the one
that we should favour in the interest of
having the best kind of social and national
outlook and thought. It is the thrifty people
who give some thought to tomorrow and the
next day as well as to today. There are a
number of things we should do, in my
opinion, in dealing with pensions. I think
we should draw the line and establish a
minimum pension that is exempt-say $75
or $100 a month-and if the pension that
falls due on the death of a person does not
exceed that it should not from any part of
the assets of the estate. If it exceeds that,
I suggest we should have a formula to apply,
which would make some allowance in the
capitalization of the value for the element
of income tax. In working out such a formula
possibly they should take a look at the
survivor to see whether he is the healthy
man on which the tables are based, or is a
very sick man; unless he is a healthy man
the Government will end up by collecting
a lot more money than it would in the
ordinary way. The situation is this: where
an estate is subject to taxation on the basis
of capitalization of the value on a mortality
or life expectancy basis, if the survivor does
not prove as healthy as the tables are drawn,
the Government bas been paid more money
than it should be paid, and after the death

of the beneficiary there is no way in which
that money can be reclaimed.
I know what the answer will be to such
a suggestion. It will be to look at the other
side of the picture, at people who live longer
than the mortality tables indicate. My reply
would be that I would be perfectly prepared
to let the acceptance or rejection of my
suggestion depend on a calculation prepared
in two columns, one in which you put the
number of survivors who live longer than the
life expectancy that was attributed to them
in the capitalization of the pension under
mortality tables, and in the other column
you put the number of those who died earlier
than the life expectancy attributed to them.
I would venture to say that those who survive
the life expectancy of the mortality tables
would be in the minority.
There is one more significant thing I wish
to draw to the attention of the bouse, and
then I shall be through with this phase of
the bill. I refer to the use of the words "on
or after the death of the deceased". I try
not to be suspicious, but the use of the word
"after" rather intrigues me. A man dies, his
pension is payable on his death to his widow,
or there is a superannuation plan, or a death
benefit plan, but why then should the department reach out with the word "after", which
would cover voluntary payments where there
was no agreement or understanding before
death. This is the situation where an employer was so moved by reason of the death
of the employee, or the conditions in which
the widow was left, or because of the high
regard he had for the employee, to want to
do something more beyond what aIl the
documents and trust deeds provided. I am
afraid the word "after" there gathers that
up and makes it part of the estate on which
the capitalized value is determined. I am
afraid that is the intended significance of
the word "after". Frankly, I do not think
the word "after" should be there.
If an employer is generous after the death
of an employee, over, above and beyond ail
the things written out in the trust documents
we, as the federal taxing authority, should
not reach out and say we want our share of
that as a capital levy. It must be remembered that we still get a share of it each
year that it is paid as income. Let us not
be too greedy on that point, I suggest, because there is a larger principle involved,
namely, that pensions, voluntary payments,
superannuation and the like, are such a good
thing, and encourage people greatly to make
provision for themselves in this fashion by
instalments during the years when they are
working and earning, that we should not do
anything to raid those accumulations by a
capital levy and thus decrease the amount

AUGUST 14, 1958
that would pass on to the beneficiary, without giving it most serious consideration, or at
least, I suggest, without establishing some
minimum level below which the federal
authority would not seek to impose any tax.
I think the province of Ontario has such a
minimum level. I do not speak with any
authority on that point, but something stirs
my recollection that there is such a provision.
Hon. Mr. Bruni: In the province of Ontario
there is provision whereby, if under a document entirely outside of your will you set
up an annuity for your widow, the amount
requiring you to provide an annuity for $100
a month will be exempt.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: Thank you.
May I summarize this point? I think we
have reached the stage in Canada, in relation
to the whole subject matter of superannuation, death benefits, voluntary payments-call
it by whatever name you like-and recognizing the well-intended purpose of such things,
that a parliamentary committee should be
established to review and study the impact
of taxation, not only federal inheritance or
estate tax, but also income tax, in relation
to the sums of money and pensions and
purposes involved.
The flight of money into that field in large
amounts can be prevented by establishing
limits that are sacrosanct and cannot be
encroached upon by taxation, especially by
capital levy. There is no difficulty in that
regard at all. It is not an argument to say
that if that field were left open all the
money would flow into it. You can remedy
that situation by establishing reasonable
limits.
On the question of valuation, which I
stated to be my second point, under this
bill-and indeed I think under the present
law-it is stated that valuation must be
made without regard to the element of income tax. The point is that if you are valuing stocks which are listed you take the
closing quotation on the day on which the
person died; and if the stocks are not listed,
you try to find a financial report, or a broker
who has made a bid that day, which could
be considered a closing bid for that day, and
that is the price you take as the value of
the shares.
But the bill goes on and refers to "controlled company". Now, this "controlled
company" must be an awful thing. Whoever
drafted this bill must at some time in his
earlier li'e have been frightened by a controlled company, because it is the bugbear,
the terrifying monster, that rears its head at
various places in this bill. Any layman reading the bill would wonder what sort of
creature was a controlled company, that it
57075-4-35

must be singled out and especially dealt with
in this particularly severe way in various
sections of the bill.
On the question of valuation, reference is
again made to the controlled company. It
may be a manufacturing company, a financial
company, or a closely held personal corporation, but it is a controlled company if it is
controlled by a combination of people related
by blood, marriage or adoption. In such case
the stock may be listed, but you cannot
take the listed price. There may be a price
in a financial journal of that day, but you
can't take that; or there may have been a
bid from a broker that day, but you can't
take that. All those avenues are closed, and
you are back to the question of fair market
value. But how, in that context you are going
to arrive at fair market value, I don't know,
especially when you consider one or two of
the other things that are put in this bill.
This is what the bill says: if a deceased
person and his relatives have 51 per cent of
stock of a controlled company-he himself
may have a minority interest, or less than
51 per cent, but if he dies under those conditions, having associated with him some
blood relatives or persons related by marriage or adoption, whose holdings total 51
per cent, then, lo and behold, the magician
on the stage does nothing in comparison with
the magic of the provisions of this section
of the bill, because it says in those circumstances a minority becomes the majority.
Fancy that! All they do is say some magie
word and the minority shares become the
majority shares.
Take a deceased person who has died
holding a minority interest; you treat his
share holdings on the same basis as if they
were a majority holding and you value
them on that basis. Now, tell me where in
common sense would you be able to sell a
minority interest on the basis of a majority
holding? In order to make the majority
holding you would have to go and make a
deal with those other shareholders. You can
well imagine, if they feel you want to get
control, what kind of deal persons holding
2 to 5 per cent of the shares that would
provide a majority would want to make.
When a man dies in those circumstances,
how you can say some magie words and in
those circumstances the minority shares
become the majority shares, passes my
comprehension.
In the committee of the other place they
attempted to bring in an amendmentHon. Mr. Howard: At what page, please?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: I refer to section 28,
page 27, lines 19 to 21.

SENATE
In the committee of the other house an
attempt was made to amend section 28 at
lines 19 to 21 by striking out those words
dealing with the valuing of minority shares
in the fashion which I have outlined, by
adding the words:
it is established that the deceased and
-unless
such one or more other persons were persons
dealing with each other at arm's length.

So the old "arm's length" theory comes up
again.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: I think you introduced
those words into the Income Tax Act, did
you not?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: I thank my honourable
friend very much for his suggestion that my
views could have had any effect on the
introduction of such a provision, but I assure
him that I had absolutely nothing to do with
anything of the kind, and I have been at all
times a violent protester against any such
measure for determining relationship. In
my opinion, as the years go by, these
expressions "arm's length" or "net at arm's
length" have become more and more impossible to deal with. The estate must establish
that it was dealing "at arm's length" with
blood relatives and those by marriage and
adoption. How do you do that? I suppose
the simplest way would be to establish that
for a considerable time before this man
died he did not even speak to his relatives,
or that be hated them, or that, although
he had adopted a child, he did not speak to
him. That, I take it, is one way in which
it could be established that the dealing was
at "arm's length". Frankly, I find it a most
baffling sort of thing to be presented as
supposedly softening the severity of the section, and why the bill is cluttered up with
a solution of this kind is difficult to fathom.
For the definition section indicates what is
meant by blood relationship and relatives
by marriage or adoption. However, it seems
that that is not enough, because in subsection
2 of section 28 language is used which, at
the risk of imposing on honourable senators
for one minute longer on this point, I will
read to you. See if you can tell what it
means:
(2) For the purposes of this section, a corporation that, immediately prior to the death of a
was controlled, whether directly or
deceased,
indirectly and whether through holding a majority
of the shares of the corporation or in any other
manner whatsoever, by the deceased, by one or
more persons connected with him as described in
subsection (1). by the deceased and such one or
more other persons or by any other person on his
or their behalf shall be deemed to be a person
connected with the deceased as described in
subsection (1).

Of all the mumbo jumbo! But I think I can
see what they are trying to say. In the first

subsection they establish how parties may
be said to be connected; that is, shareholders
connected by blood, marriage or adoption.
But they feel that maybe there is left some
kind of a way of escape so they had better
define in the second subsection how it is
possible for the company to be connected
with the shareholders in a certain way. It
presents some problems, but it does not add
anything to my understanding of the situation.
One thing which is added has to do with
the case of a controlled company, of an
individual as well, in certain circumstances
of outstanding debts at death. If there was
money owing by such company at the time
of death, or if some person was identified
with you in this relationship, and, say, you
advanced money two years before you died
to such person or such company on a fixed
basis, for instance a time note payable in
five years, and there might be two or three
years to go after the man's death, we have
to put this awful controlled corporation, or
anybody who happens to be connected in any
way, in a special category, and in such case
it is net permissible to establish the present
value of the debt on the basis that it has
two or three or five years to run, but only
on the basis that it is immediately payable.
Talk about a fantastic and fanciful formula! I think if I had time I could find a
lot more adjectives beginning with "V' for
that formula, to cover the kind of treatment given to this awful entity known as a
controlled company.
I have tried not to labour this too much,
but my suggestion is that the method of
valuation is unrealistic. In the United States
they permit optional methods, and if there
is any sale meanwhile, the price establishes
the value.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Who has the option of
selecting the method?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: The estate. For our
purposes a year may be too long. We make
the tax payable within six months after
death. I am sure the revenues would not
suffer, and the persons involved in the estate
would feel they were more fairly dealt with,
if this optional basis of valuation were
permitted; because the one thing-usuallythat a man or woman cannot control is the
date of death; that is, unless he has suicidal
tendencies. From my own experience in
dealing with estates I could mention cases
where the date of death provision has been
most unfortunate. The death occurred when
the market was at the peak, and the market
kept going down; the tax was based on the
value of the securities at the date of death,
and a substantial part of the estate was
eaten up by taxes because, since a valley had

AUGUST 14, 1958
developed in the market, the price recovered
from the sale of shares to meet the payment
was much less. My suggestion for ironing
out this difficulty is to have optional dates
-the date of death, or six months afterwards, or the price realized from a sale
meanwhile.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: For all kinds of
property?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: Yes.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Everything?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: Yes. What better test of
true value could there be? Surely we are interested in the true value. Surely the federal
authority is not interested in getting any
higher figure than the true value. We do not
need all these fanciful and fictional values.
The duty must be paid in six months; meanwhile estate assets must be sold to realize
the money. What better or fairer test of the
value could there be than the amount realized
from the sale to pay the duty? That seems
to me the fairest and simplest way.
I have stated the method which is followed
in the United States, and I do not need to
elaborate on it. Possibly I have taken more
time on these points than I should have done.
However, there is just one other thing I want
to speak about. It is the provision that income
tax cannot be a factor in the determination
of value. That is the present law and you
will find it in section 26, on page 26 of the
bill, which reads:
For the purposes of this part, in determining the
value of any property no allowance or deduction
shall be made for or on account of Income tax.

The market always takes into account the
possible tax liability. In other words, if a
company has a possible exposure to tax
liability its shares will sell for less. But how
can you say you can arrive at a fair value
if you ignore the factor of income tax? You
have an income tax liability, and I have
described how that works in relation to pensions and how it continues each year. I cannot see how in relation to an asset on which
income tax may be payable you can ignore
that as a factor of value. It seems to me
that income tax is an element just the same
as anything else. I am not saying it is an
exclusive element but I say there should not
be a prohibition against determination of the
fair market value, taking into consideration
the possible impact of income tax.
The only other thing I want to point out is
that when this bill becomes law the executors
will certainly need to consult their lawyers
very, very carefully. They have a very
serious liability imposed on them. For
instance, you will find under section 3 of the
bill that property which is part of an estate

57075-4-35J

for tax purposes may never come into the
hands of the executors. It may be something
that the deceased person gave away two years
before he died; but anything he gave
away within three years of his death
is part of the estate for tax purposes.
That is the present law. The executor
may not know that such a gift has
been made but if he goes ahead and distributes the estate and distributes some part of
it to the person who may have been the
recipient of a gift, then he is liable for that
tax unless he can show that he exercised all
due diligence and took reasonable precautions to ensure that the amount payable
by him was payable in full, because his
obligation is not to pay anything to any
person who may be liable for tax otherwise
in relation to the estate without retaining
money to pay that tax. If it is demanded of
him he also has an obligation to pay the tax
on these amounts which may never come
into his hands. It is certainly making more
onerous the position of an executor. I think
it was suggested somewhere in the course of
the consideration of this bill "Well, the
executor can go to work and make inquiries."
But when does he know he has reached a
stage where he has exercised all due diligence
and taken all reasonable precautions? Is
there any place he can ever get a release?
Is there ever a time when he can go to the
department and the department will say to
him, "Yes, you have done all that can be
expected of you. You have exercised all due
diligence and we acquit you."
Hon. Mr. Bruni: There is the four-year
period.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: I know there is a limitation period except in the case of fraud, but
there is no provision for the executor ever
being released or discharged from his responsibility. It may be that these words are the
best ones they could get, but I suggest that
careful thought should be given to this. There
should be some provision under which the
executor should be able to get a release and
discharge. A trustee in bankruptcy or even
a debtor can get a discharge so why should
the executor have to wait until the statute
has run out? Mind you, the statute may not
run, because in some other aspect of the
estate quite unknown to the executor there
may be an element of fraud that keeps the
time from running. We should be careful
about the revenues of the country, for the
country needs these revenues, but we
should also be careful that we are not
making the duties being imposed upon executors too onerous. We should provide them
with some method in which, after a reasonable time, they are through. The federal

SENATE
authority can always pursue a person who
has got money improperly.
Honourable senators, there are many other
things in this bill that I have not dealt with.
I have deliberately not done so because I
feel in all this enumeration of what constitutes property of an estate on death involves
items that are difficult and particular. The
only principle you could find running through
them is getting as much into an estate as
possible, and it is pretty hard to debate that
principle. This seems to be an aspect of the
legislation that might more properly be considered in committee than in a discussion on
second reading when we are trying to keep
more broadly to the field of principle. When
I talked about the approach to pensions and
insurance values I felt I should do so to the
extent I did as a matter of exposing what I
think the law is and what this bill does. I
think there should be some change in it and
that honourable senators should give serious
consideration to these points before we permit this bill to pass into law.
Hon. Arthur W. Roebuck: Honourable
senators, it is not my intention to engage
in a general discussion of this bill. That will
be taken care of by the honourable gentlemen
who have already spoken and by others who
follow me. I wish to make just one point,
and in a non-controversial way. I wish to call
it to the attention of the authorities and
others concerned for correction, I hope,
later on.
It has already been said that this bill is
not the last word. I am sure this is true and
that there will be revisions and amendments
from time to time. In this country there are
a great many branches of charitable institutions, such as churches, with headquarters
across the international line in the United
States, and some in England and in other
countries. When a member of a church makes
a bequest to his church which has its headquarters abroad, his donation is not exempt
from taxation in the valuation of his estate.
However, if his donation is to a charitable
institution within this country, then the value
of the donation is exempt. That has been the
law in the past and it will still be the law,
according to this bill. I direct the attention of
honourable senators to section 7 (1) (d) of the
bill at page 10, which provides for exemption of:
(d) The value of any gift made by the deceased
whether during his lifetime or by his will. where
such gift can be established to have been absolute,
to
(i) any organization in Canada

I draw attention to the words "in Canada".
-that at the time of the making of the gift, was
a charitable organization operated exclusively as

such and not for the benefit, gain or profit of any
proprietor, member or shareholder thereof,-

If that charitable organization is in Canada,
the value of any gift to it is deducted from
the taxable portion of the estate.
Honourable senators, it has been held that
churches are charitable organizations. As we
all know, a number of churches in Canada
have headquarters across the international
line. The point that I wish considered is the
fact that the rule is different in the United
States, where if a testator makes a gift to a
charitable organization whose headquarters
is in Canada the gift is exempt from succession duties. I have authority for what I say.
The latest estate tax regulations in the
United States provide for the deduction from
the estate of a decedent who was a citizen
or a resident of the United States, of
charitable provisions regardless of where the
charity operates or spends its money. These
are exempt. This applies to the United States
federal tax. Some of the various states follow the federal provisions; some confine the
exemptions to charities operating in the state,

and others provide for a reciprocal treatment
as between the state imposing the death tax
and the state in which the charity is organ-

ized. However, most of the states have an
additional provision whereby the total tax
imposed by the state is brought up to 80 per
cent of the federal tax, so that in these cases
the adjustment, would, in effect, allow a
deduction for foreign charitable bequests.
The provisions under the Dominion Succession Duty Act of Canada ever since its
passage in 1941 have allowed exemptions only
in respect of amounts passing to charitable
organizations in Canada.
We have a certain sense of reciprocity as
between Canada and the United States. What
they do there is, as a rule, not more generous
than what we do here. The fact that the
United States, both federally and in most, if
not all, of its states, grants exemption to
charitable gifts to organizations without the
borders of the United States, or to be spent
without the borders of the United States is,
I think, a very good argument why we should
extend the same benefits to people making
bequests in Canada to churches and other
charitable organizations whose headquarters
are outside of Canada.
Hon. William R. Bruni: Honourable senators, in my opening remarks I would like to
repeat what has already been said, namely,
that this bill replaces the present Dominion
Succession Duty Act and provides for a tax
on property passing or deeming to pass on
the death of any person. The tax, of course,
is computed by a reference to the property
comprising the estate of the deceased rather

AUGUST 14, 1958
than the property passing in the various bequests from the estate to the various
beneficiaries.
The bill as originally introduced in the
other house has had a number of its clauses
amended by the Banking and Commerce
Committee of that house. However, I do feel
that certain additional amendments are required to correct a number of ambiguities and
inequalities as are now contained in the bill,
which will make the act one that is much
fairer and more just and equitable. One cannot, of course, go through the bill clause by
clause, as that would take a great deal of
time. Therefore I propose to deal with only
a few sections. I am not going to deal with
general principles-the honourable senator
from Toronto (Hon. Mr. Hayden) did that in
a magnificent manner-but I will deal with
a few specific sections which I believe might
well be amended.
I beg to refer honourable senators to clause
2, paragraph 1, Part I, which provides that
an estate tax shall be paid on the value of all
property passing on the death of every person
domiciled in Canada at the time of his death.
The use of the word "domicile" in any taxing
act immediately creates a great deal of confusion. The law of domicile, at least in the
province of Ontario, is one of the vaguest and
most complicated conceptions in our law.
Many persons now resident in Canada have
no clear conception as to the place of their
domicile, and before any lawyer could advise
them with any confidence he would have to
institute a far-reaching and expensive inquiry which would generally lead to no firm
or definite decision. To further complicate
matters, there is at present no such thing as
a Canadian domicile at law. What, therefore,
is the position of an emigrant to Canada who
intends to spend the rest of his life in Canada
but for one reason or another moves from
province to province every little while? As
his sojourn in each province is purely temporary, such an emigrant would never acquire
a domicile of choice in one of the provinces,
and his domicile might well perhaps for ever
remain his domicile of origin, which would
be the country-perhaps in Europe-from
which he emigrated to Canada. Of all the
countries in the world Canada should be the
last one to make any distinction based on the
place of birth between its citizens, as we have
probably one of the highest of foreign populations of any nation in the world today. Why
could not the draftsmen of this Estate Tax
Bill have used the same text as is now used
in our Income Tax Act, i.e., "resident or
ordinarily resident in Canada", so that any
person liable for income tax in Canada would
also be liable to pay estate tax under Part I
of this new act?

Hon. Mr. Howard: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Bruni: Part II of the bill, commencing with section 34, deals with the tax
which is imposed on estates of all persons
who are domiciled outside of Canada and
leave estates within Canada. Such persons
pay a tax at a fiat rate of 15 per cent of
the aggregate value of the property left.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: Would the honourable
senator permit a question on that point? In
dealing with Part II would you agree that
the 15 per cent tax represents a substantial
reduction as against the rates that might
apply at present?
Hon. Mr. Bruni: I am coming to that; I
have an example dealing with that very
matter.
Clause 35, paragraph 1, sets forth the method
to be used in computing the aggregate value
of an estate. This section, of course, could
lead to grave injustices. For example, supposing a person domiciled in the United States,
although a resident of Canada, purchases a
large tract of land adjacent to one of our
large cities for the price or sum of $1 million,
and supposing he has paid cash for the said
parcel, that is, paid out the whole $1 million.
Of the purchase price of $1 million let us
suppose the person contributed $100,000 of
his own money and borrowed the remaining
$900,000 from one of our chartered banks. A
deed of the property is taken in the name
of such a person. There is no encumbrance
against the property, and under clauses 35
and 36 an estate tax of 15 per cent on the
total value of the land, namely, $1 million,
would be imposed. Such tax would amount
to $150,000, even though the equity of the
deceased person in such land would actually
be only $100,000.
However, if the $900,000 of the purchase
price was secured by or was a charge on
the property, then such person would be
taxed on only $100,000. To me it would appear to be much fairer and more equitable
to allow such person to deduct the total
amount of his indebtedness in Canada used
for the purchase of the said property from
the aggregate value of the property left,
whether or not such indebtedness was secured
by a charge against the property.
Now, it is a well-known fact that a wife
upon marriage acquires the domicile of her
husband. Therefore, let us take a hypothetical case where a Canadian woman marries
a man domiciled in the United States, and
such woman dies and leaves an estate having
a net value of $1 million. Even though the
woman and her husband resided in Canada
from the day of the marriage, if the husband
had not given up his American domicile the
wife's estate on her death could only be

SENATE
taxed 15 per cent since she would be considered as a person domiciled outside of
Canada. If this tax was based on residence
rather than domicile the estate of such a
woman would be taxed at the rates as set
out in the act for persons domiciled in
Canada.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: Resident in Canada?
Hon. Mr. Bruni: No, domiciled in Canadathat is the wording used in the bill and that
is what we have to go by. On a $1 million
estate such tax would amount to $331,500.00.
Under the bill using the word "domicile"
the tax amounts to only $15,000.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: Might that not account
for some of the estimated reduction in revenue from this tax when the new bill becomes
law?
Hon. Mr. Bruni: It well might. There are
other things that will cut down the revenue
which I do not think should be included in
this bill.
The honourable senator from Toronto (Hon.
Mr. Hayden) referred to exemptions, and I
would like to say a word or two regarding
these.
Clause 7, paragraph 1, provides an exemption or deduction of $60,000 where the deceased is a male person survived by a spouse.
A somewhat surprising result of this particular provision is that this deduction may be
claimed whether or not the widow or spouse
derives any benefit from the estate. In the
case of a male person dying leaving a wife
surviving, and leaving all or substantially all
of his property to a stranger, the deduction
of $60,000 still applies. This treatment, to
my mind, is altogether too generous, and
any estate of $60,000 passing to a stranger
should not, under any circumstances, be
exempt from the payment of an estate tax.
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: Très bien.
Hon. Mr. Bruni: Other inequalities can
arise as the result of the exemptions set out
in clause 7, paragraph 1, of the bill. Supposing a person dies leaving a widow and 15
dependent children under the age of 21. Some
of you may smile and say it is impossible,
but it is not impossible. Clause 7 provides for
an exemption of $60,000 for the widow and
$10,000 exemption for each dependent child
under 21. In such a case the total exemption
would be $210,000-$60,000 for the widow
and $150.000 for the children. If the deceased
person, however, did not leave a spouse, the
exemption for each dependent child under 21
years would be $15,000 and the total exemption would be $225,000. This does not appear
to be fairHon. Mr. Hayden: It does not make sense.

Hon. Mr. Bruni: -since surely a widow
with 15 children is entitled to a larger exemption than in the case where there is no
widow and there are 15 children surviving
the testator.
In neither of the above mentioned examples is it necessary for the testator to leave
his estate to his spouse and children. The
entire estate could be left to a stranger and
no estate tax would be payable. Now, I realize
we will be faced with this situation, that
each province now has a Dependants' Relief
Act and a widow -can go to court and obtain
a share of the estate. But think of the case
where the testator may have provided for
his widow in his lifetime.
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: We have no law like
that in Quebec.
Hon. Mr. Bruni: Now, clause 9 can produce
some very peculiar results. This clause deals
with the deduction from the dominion tax
by virtue of some part of the duty paid by
a decedent domiciled in a prescribed province.
For the purpose of presenting this argument
I am going to take two provinces as the
prescribed provinces in Canada, namely, the
province of Ontario and the province of
Quebec. Let us take a specific example. A
man dies domiciled in Ontario with all his
assets s'ituated outside the prescribed province. Let us assume that these assets have
a situs in the province of Manitoba by reason
of their being fully registered bonds of this
province. Under these circumstances, while
the full duty will be paid to the provincial
Government of Ontario there will be no
rebate on the dominion tax, because the
bonds are presumed to have their situs in
the province of Manitoba due to the fact
that they are registered bonds. However, if
instead of being registered bonds of the
province of Manitoba, the decedent had
exactly the same securities but in bearer
form, situated in the prescribed province,that is, Ontario-then the assets would be
considered to be in the prescribed province,
and there would therefore be the proper
proportion of the Ontario duty deducted as
rebate on the dominion tax. I do not think
this is fair.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: What do you suggest
by way of a change?
Hon. Mr. Bruni: You could take the actual
physical location.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: Why not simply eliminate the section and provide that the common
law rule shall apply? Then the province and
dominion would be in agreement.
Hon. Mr. Bruni: That is one solution to it.

AUGUST 14, 1958
Another even more startling and peculiar
result is produced by clause 9 of this bill,
in that if the bonds issued by a foreign
corporation-for instance, a corporation in the
state of New York-are among the assets
of an estate, and they are fully registered,
any tax which is paid to the foreign country
or state-in this case the United States and/
or the state of New York-can be deducted
from the tax which would be payable under
clause 9 of this bill. I would strongly
recommend that there be no distinguishment
of situs on property anywhere in Canada.
Also, the rules of situs as set out in the act
are not necessarily the same as the principles
laid down by the courts over long periods
of time, and this will be very confusing and
perhaps a source of unnecessary litigation,
which should be avoided at all costs.
I would like to say a brief word about
annuities and pensions. Clause 3(1)k provides for an estate tax to be paid on any payments made by an employer to an employee on
the death of the employee.
The Hon. the Acting Speaking (Hon. Mr.
Choquette): Honourable senators Rule 13 of
the Rules of the Senate of Canada reads as
follows:
If, at six of the clock in the afternoon, the
business be not concluded, the Speaker or the
Chairman of the Committee of the Whole leaves
the Chair until half-past seven of the clock; the
Mace being left on or under the table, as the case
may be.

Pursuant to this rule, I now leave the Chair.
The sitting will be resumed this evening at
7.30.
At 7.30 p.m. the sitting was resumed, Hon.
Lionel Choquette, Acting Speaker, in the
Chair.
Hon. Mr. Brunt: Honourable senators, at six
o'clock I had reached the point where I
proposed to deal with the tax on annuity
payments, premiums and commission funds.
Under clause 3 (1) (k) it is provided
that estate tax to be paid on any payments
made by an employer to an employee on the
death of the employee. The honourable
senator from Toronto (Hon. Mr. Hayden)
referred to this. If an employer out of the
goodness of his heart, or its collective heart
if it is a company, sees fit to make provision
for the dependants of one of its deceased
valued employees, and the provision is made
entirely voluntarily-there is no contribution by the employee, he has nothing to do
with it-surely it is enough for the Government of Canada to subject the provision
to tax as income in the hands of the dependant as a death benefit without seeking

also to impose an estate tax. It has been
suggested that this clause 3 (1) (k) should
be omitted frorn the bill and if necessary
subclause (i) could be expanded somewhat
so as to place the burden upon the estate to
establish that the deceased did not directly
or indirectly purchase or provide for the
payment which the company makes to his
widow and/or dependants. In such a case
no estate tax would be paid.
An illustration of the combined impact of
estate taxes and income taxes on a death
benefit from a pension plan is as follows:
If A and B are in the same tax bracket and
each uses $100 of his income, A to contribute
to a pension plan and B to buy bonds, this
will be the result: A's entire $100 will go
into the pension plan because tax is deferred
on contributions to such plans, but B will
pay tax on his $100 and have left only, say,
$80 to invest in bonds. If both die a year
later and A's heirs receive as a death benefit
from his pension the $100 contribution, they
will pay an income tax of $20-without taking into account the special basis of income
tax provided by section 36 of the Income
Tax Act-leaving $80 for themselves, but
estate tax will be not levied on $80, it will
be levied on the full $100. On the other
hand B's heirs will have the $80 bond free
of further income tax and will be liable for
tax only on $80.
If the estate taxes on a death benefit
from a pension plan amount to 50 per cent
of the benefit and the recipient of the benefit
is in a 60 per cent income tax bracket, one
can readily see what will happen. Both
taxes being levied on the gross amount of
the benefit, the combined taxes are obviously
in excess of the benefit. So any recipient
would be well advised to say, "I don't want
any part of it".
Section 17 provides for the paynent of a
tax on an annuity by a successor but no provision is made for the payment by instalments on a life estate created by the will as
was provided in section 29, subsection (1)
of the present Dominion Succession Duty
Act. While there is provision in section 17
for the exercise of a discretionary power in
the minister to defer the time for payment
of duties, it should be pointed out that section 17 requires payment of interest in the
event of such deferment. A fair recommendation would be that provision should
be made for the payment of tax by the
executor on annuities and life interests by
instalments.
Recently the American Government has
dealt with this matter. What they have
done is to enlarge from 15 months to 10
years the time for payment of estate taxes
where the estates involved are closely held.

SENATE
I think that our Government might give
serious consideration to extending in a case
such as this the time for the payment of
estate tax, and to accepting it in instalments.
The combined impact of succession duty
and income tax on surplus of companies,
lump sum payments of annuities on the
death of the annuitant, premium commission
funds of life insurance, agents, and so on,
involve double taxation. You can't avoid it,
it is there. I have in mind a company that
bas a total worth of, say, $1 million, made
up of $200,000 capital stock and $800,000
surplus. This company is owned by an
individual who has very few outside assets,
and on his death it will be necessary to
realize on the assets of the company to pay
estate tax on, say, $1 million, of which
$800,000 will be subject to income tax at a
high rate, so that in effect the surplus of
$800,000 will only net $400,000. I feel that
if the taxes were levied at a value of, say,
$600,000 with respect to this particular company, instead of $1 million, the Government
would be receiving all it is entitled to and
the estate would be treated in a fair and
just manner.
Mention was made earlier of foreign real
estate, and here we find another change in
principle in that foreign real estate comes
into the computation of the aggregate taxable value of all estates. The foreign real
estate attracts an estate tax. Under our present Succession Duty Act the value of
foreign real estate is included only in computing the initial rate, but does not form
part of a dutiable succession.
This bill makes a concession in that it
provides for a deduction from the tax applicable to the real estate situate in a foreign
country, the amount of inheritance tax levied
on such property by a foreign country.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: Or the lesser of?
Hon. Mr. Bruni: That's right. The practice
of acquiring real estate in a duty-free
jurisdiction will be hard hit by this amendment.
This change is a radical departure from
the former accepted practice in which real
estate is subject to taxation on death only
in the jurisdiction where it is situate. The
general rule, which appears to be almost
international, is that real estate bears its
own burdens, including death taxes and
duties. The United Kingdom does not aggregate what is not taxable, so that real estate
situate in the United Kingdom is taxed as an
asset by itself, the resulting tax being low.
Hon. Mr. Howard: That's right.
Hon. Mr. Bruni: This proposed legislation
may well cause other countries to adopt
similar measures to our detriment, as foreign

capital bas made ana is making a major
contribution to the development of real estate
in Canada. If for no other reason than that,
this section should be considered again very,
very carefully and, in my opinion, should be
amended.
Now we come to the liability of an executor.
I don't think it is quite as bad as my honourable friend from Toronto (Hon. Mr. Hayden)
made out. There has been a little relief
given to the executor. Clauses 12 and 13 of
the present bill deal with the matter of
assessment of estates, payment of tax and
the liabilities of an executor. The wording
of these sections gives to the minister the
right to reassess an estate within four years
of the original assessment or, which is very
important, within four years of the issuance
of a notice in lieu of an assessment. As the
act was originally worded the four years ran
from the period when the assessment was
made. This meant that in any estates where
no assessment was made, the estate not being
dutiable or taxable, the four-year limitation
period did not apply, and the Government
very properly has seen fit to arrange that a
notice will be issued in connection with all
estates not dutiable on the information filed
with the Government, and that the fouryear period will run from that time. Thus
an executor in theory cannot completely
distribute an estate until the lapse of the
aforesaid period of four years, because within
that four-year period the taxing authority
can come back at any time and reassess the
estate and possibly impose further taxes.
The sections further state that the Minister may re-open for additional taxation, at
any time, if further taxable assets are discovered, even by way of gifts, during the
three year period. The effect of these two
clauses is to place an intolerable burden on
an executor for four years, because during that
time he can never distribute the estate with
safety.
The executor, however, is not held liable,
provided he can establish satisfactorily that
be has exercised all due diligence and taken
all reasonable precautions to ensure that the
amount of tax so payable by him was paid in
full. Now, to be perfectly fair, I do not think
that is quite as difficult to do as my honourable friend from Toronto suggested it was
this afternoon. However, there is still one
very serious omission: no provision is made
for the issuance to the executor of a Certificate
of Clearance. Surely such a certificate should
issue automatically after the lapse of the
four-year period referred to in clause 12 of
the bill.
In conclusion, honourable senators, I say
that while this bill contains many changes
made which are quite satisfactory and in
order with respect to the taxation of estates,

AUGUST 14, 1958
still, however, as outlined above, there are,
in my opinion, a number of clauses which
should be amended, not only to bring about
the just and equitable imposition of an estate
tax on estates, but also from the point of view
of the taxing authorities of the Government.
In certain Cases I do not think the Government is getting the taxes to which it is
entitled, and we have to look at the Government's rights and try to come up with
something fair and equitable to both.
Hon. Mr. Howard: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Bruni: Honourable senators, I
would not want the remarks which I have
made to be construed in any way as criticism
of Government policy with respect to the
taxation of estates. Rather I would ask honourable senators to consider my remarks as
having been made on a basis that, in my
opinion, they constitute what is commonly
known as "constructive criticism" of this bill.
The taxation of estates in Canada by an
Estate Tax Act is something that is entirely
new in this country, since in the past it has
always been the policy of all governments,
both dominion and provincial, to levy succession duties rather than an estate tax. In
fact, the provinces of Ontario and Quebec
will continue to levy succession duties and
will not impose estate taxes. In view of
this, it is only natural that the bill-

view of this it is only natural that the bill
as now presented in this chamber is not
perfect in every respect.
I know that the junior senator from
Winnipeg (Hon. Mr. Thorvaldson) will be
moving that the bill be referred to the Committee on Banking and Commerce. However,
I feel that he should go further than that,
and when moving the reference to committee
he should suggest that a public hearing be
held, witnesses called, and, if necessary, that
the committee be authorized to retain the
services of counsel and to employ such
technical and clerical assistance as may be
required by the committee from time to time
in order to properly review in detail all the
provisions of this bill.
It has been stated by a number of honourable members in the other place that the
Government will collect less money in taxation under this bill than the amount which
is now being collected under the Dominion
Succession Duty Act. For this additional
reason I can see no necessity for this bill
being rushed through committee; in fact, I
feel that the committee should take al the
time necessary to consider the bill in its

the bill, and I hope that they will view my
own dealings with the bill in a similar
manner.
Let me first of all congratulate the Government upon having introduced the bill in the
House of Commons last session and made
advance copies available to facilitate a careful study of the bill by interested people,
including Government experts, who could
examine it in detail and thus be able to make
their own suggestions and recommendations
for amendments to it.
As a matter of fact everybody knows that
quite a number of people have taken advantage of the opportunity to recommend
amendments to the bill. The only thing I
regret is that these recommendations and
suggestions have not borne more fruit, and
that the Government has not decided to
amend the bill in a proper way before its
presentation to the House of Commons and
to this house. The few amendments that
have been made to the bill are not very
important, and have not in any way settled
all the difficulties, all the doubts, and all the
inequities that the bill carries with it.
Succession duties in one form or another
have existed since time immemorial. As a
matter of fact, they existed at the time of
the Egyptians and Romans. In our own country, in France, in England and in the whole
of Europe during the feudal era the lord imposed some kind of succession duties upon
his vassals; and here in Canada the seigneur
imposed some kind of succession duties on
his tenants, and when one of them died his
heirs had to pay a certain amount, which was
of course small compared to succession duties
today. That amount was paid in recognition
of the fact that the seigneur still had an interest in the ceded property.
Everybody knows that the seignorial rights,
for a long time objected to in France and
in Canada, were at that time considered a
heavy burden, but compared to the present
time, evidently they were very light. In one
form or another succession duties have
existed in most of the Canadian provinces
since 1892. I know in Quebec they were imposed in that year, and I think that is also
true of Ontario. They have become part of
our federal statutes only since the Second
World War. If war could serve as a motive
for such federal taxation, when we were
faced with a struggle for freedom and had
to resort to most drastic measures, it seems
to me that once hostilities ceased special
amendments could have been made to such
confiscatory legislation.
The heavy provincial succession duties
were motivated for a long time by the ever
increasing responsibility placed on the
shoulders of each province, and the small

amount of income that the provinces could
collect in the face of those continually increasing obligations.
The inconveniences brought about by provincial succession duties were not as bad as
those caused by the federal succession duties,
because the changes brought about by provincial succession duties affected only provincial
prerogatives, such as property, marriage, the
family, matrimonial conventions, civil contracts like sales and donations; in other
words, matters falling under the exclusive
jurisdiction of the province.
Such is not the case with the federal
taxation of estates, where the federal Government has, as an ancillary power, the
right to encroach upon matters of exclusive
provincial legislation, and of course it does
do so. It is unfortunate that our federal
authority did not withdraw from this field
of taxation to give free access thereto to
the provinces in conformity with their demand, which appeared quite well founded,
as the provinces seem to have, for 40 years,
been exercising exclusive jurisdiction in this
field.
I would not go so far as to claim that the
legislation is at the present time unconstitutional. However, here was an occasion on
which it was hoped that the federal Government would deem it opportune to abandon
that field of taxation which had for over 40
years been exclusively provincial. The provincial tax, however, was already so high
that the intrusion by the federal Government
in that domain made that mode of taxation
detestable and, in the result, confiscatory.
Three basic arguments have been invoked
in favour of federal tax on estates. First it
furnishes a means of finding out whether in
his lifetime a taxpayer has duly paid his
income tax. Weil, this is absolutely childish,
because a taxation of one-tenth of one per
cent on an estate would be just as effective
as a tax of 50 per cent to find out whether a
man has paid his income tax. A nominal tax,
if a tax is necessary at all, would be sufficient.
I do not believe that a tax is necessary to find
out whether a man has paid his income tax
or to permit the federal authorities to look
into his estate for that purpose. But, I repeat,
if a tax were necessary, one-tenth of one per
cent would be quite adequate. This argument
for the tax is so childish that I do not think
it is necessary to consider it any further.
The second argument invoked to justify
federal taxation of estates is as follows: The
federal Government is a factor of progress,
aiding the progress of national and international industry and trade, and through the
aid which it brings to some enterprises citizens
are enabled to exploit opportunities and receive a certain amount of benefit, so that the

AUGUST 14, 1958
owner is legitimately bound to pay succession
duty to the benefactor Government. In other
words, if in your trade or business you benefit
from the fact that Confederation exists, and
if, owing to the fact of the existence of
Canada, you have accumulated a fortune, it
is only fair that you should pay to the government a part of the amount it has permitted you
to accumulate. Well, it seems to me that we
already pay sufficient taxes to enable the
Government to protect our trade, commerce
and industry; and my feeling is that, in affording some kind of benefits to its citizens, the
Government does no more than its duty. The
fact is that if there were no trade or industry
in Canada, Confederation would not exist.
Secondly, it is my opinion that even though
in some cases Government action affords
benefits to national, international or interprovincial trade, these cases are exceptional.
Most of our small fortunes have been accumulated locally; they have not sprung from
the existence of Canada. Very few Canadian
citizens have national or interprovincial trade
on a scale which permits them to accumulate
large fortunes. One person who talked to me
on this matter cited large stores having mail
order business, and he was scandalized because the owners, when they die, do not
contribute anything to Canada but that all the
money due from them by way of succession
duty goes to the provinces. As may be realized, these people are extremely few, and the
argument does not touch local trade. The
small trader, the owner of a small enterprise
who has made a little money, has been successful because of local laws, local police, local
organizations. So, I submit, apart from the
few big fortunes which have been accumulated through the existence of Confederation,
small fortunes should be subject only to local
conditions, that is to say to taxation by the
province to whom they owe the benefits they
have derived in the course of their business
life.
The third argument which was put to me
on behalf of the federal tax is that the federal Government needs the money to balance
its budget. This plea does not convince me,
for various reasons, of which I will mention
only two. First, succession duties produce
such a small amount that they cannot have
any influence worth mentioning on the federal Government.
In fact, where small
estates are concerned, the revenue so derived
does not exceed a few million dollars per
year. There is no doubt in my mind that a
constriction of administrative expenses-and
there must be many places for the exercise
of economy-would save the Government
from having to impose this type of taxation,
which bears hardly not only on families but
on almost everybody. From 1948 to 1955

the revenue branch collected on account of
succession duties an amount of between $31
million and $40 million per year. That sum
does not represent even one per cent of the
income of the federal Government; and
small estates, namely, estates below $200,000,
do not represent more than two-tenths of
that one per cent. That is why it is surprising that there should be imposed, through
this legislation, a burden which affects so
many people of comparatively small means.
It is not to be supposed that the owners of
the large fortunes are the ones who are most
affected by this tax. Wealthy people can
find so many ways and means to avoid it
that they are not much concerned; it is the
small man, the man operating a small industry in Canada, the man who has to live his
life and make his fortune here, who is
really affected. A wealthy man, in spite of
taxation, always retains a sufficient amount of
money to be able to carry on with his family obligations. The poor man does not pay.
It is the middle-class who carry all the
burdens, who are affected by this legislation.
I was told by a man, whose name I will not
divulge but who is a very important member of the Government, that in 1955 estates
of the value of $100,000 did not yield the
Government more than $4 million. At that
time the succession duties were to a certain
extent amended so that no duty should be
paid on estates of $50,000 or less.
In concluding this part of my argument
I want to say that I am in favour of granting total relief to modest estates and being
more generous to our Canadian families, although I consider that the taxation of large
estates should remain on a reasonable basis.
I am going to talk about this a little later
on. That large estates should make their
contribution to the federal budget, I do not
object. That is only fair. I feel that those
who have accumulated large fortunes should
not, however, be discouraged. Often they
have worked pretty hard and assumed tremendous risks. Our young country of Canada
needs men of such ability and courage, men
who can assume risks which are especially
necessary for the development of our natural
resources. These men should not be discouraged by taxation so high it could be
considered confiscatory.
One amendment I am going to propose is
that the tax should not exceed 50 per cent.
It seems to me that when a man has paid
50 per cent of what he has accumulated
during his lifetime he has paid enough, if
the tax is not to be considered confiscatory.
If every wealthy man were to disappear from
Canada and we had no one to take the risks
that they usually assume for the development of this country, we would miss a very

SENATE
important section of our economy. But the
modest, ordinary prosperous businessmen, the
industrial and commercial operators, constitute the most important section of our economy. This section of our economy should be
a permanent one, and I am sorry to find that
the present act encroaches on such a precious
asset. The law depletes small fortunes and
will go a long way to discourage the most
willing of our citizens from economizing.
Many of our citizens have worked during
their whole lifetime to create their trade or
industry. They have sacrificed many pleasures to save for their old age or accumulate
enough money to secure the permanency of
the enterprise they have founded, and to
provide more than the mere necessities for
their families. Faced with the spectre of
this legislation-not only the present bill but
the act as it now stands, which is just as bad
-they are forced to sell their business either
to large corporations or to strangers, in order
to secure the necessary funds for the purpose
of paying succession duties. You would be
surprised to find how many in the last 15
years have had to sell their own or their
family business in order to realize enough
money to pay these taxes.
I propose to suggest several amendments
which will help to avoid the disastrous consequence of the policy actually in force now
and which this bill intends to continue.
I wish to be well understood and, therefore, I repeat that large estates should pay
succession duties, but the duties should not
be confiscatory. Small estates should be given
much more protection. The disappearance of
modest fortunes and family businesses would
destroy one of the most important sections
of the Canadian economy, and Canadians
would lose all stimulus to reasonable individual ambitions. Work and sacrifice should
be encouraged instead of discouraged. This
is the mission of the state, and it seems to
me that in this bill it is not fulfilling such
mission very well. It is doing the very
opposite.
The right to acquire property is not a
favour granted by the state to an individual.
The right to own property is the result and
the fruits of labour. It is a natural right
that he has and, I may say, it is the guarantee
of individual freedom and the independence
of his family.
I do not stand for those who preach
state paternalism, that sort of administration
under which all the citizens are dependent
upon the Government and rely on its paternity
to carry out their own existence. Clémenceau
said once: "The state has too many children
to be a good pater familias."
If it is now possible to conceive a country
from which poverty disappears, so much the

better and I am all for it. The purpose of
social laws which have gained so much
favour during the twentieth century is to
make sure that more and more citizens will
enjoy the welfare necessary to their development. Poverty inculcates neither virtue nor a
sense of responsibility in citizens, and if our
social laws are going to help take away excessive riches or divide them among those
who have none, it would be to misunderstand
the economies of a country, to weaken the
notion of acquiring property and to submit
all the citizens to a despotic power and a state
of general poverty. Private property is necessary in a democracy, and its development
cannot be pursued unless free contribution of
its operation is guaranteed against all exOur citizens should
orbitant restrictions.
not be at the mercy of the state. Property
must be a prerogative of free man. It is
not because some citizens have abused the
ownership of property that it should be
abolished or restricted in such a way that it
does not count any more in our economy.
The right of property, as the right to dispose by will of one's assets, has always
been recognized as an intrinsic freedom of
individuals. This is only natural. Its suppression is surely an artificial invention of the
modern state. It is contrary to the dignity
of man. The state must preserve these essential freedoms, these inalienable rights. It is
not its mission to take them away or expose
them to compromise. If it were to follow
that road to error it would come close to
the most obvious communism. The state must
unofficially help the development of property
rights and should not reduce them to the
rank of simple privileges. But this is what it
does when it submits estates to a régime of
excessive assessments. It crushes by high
taxation the right of the citizen to accumulate property freely and without fear that
his estate might be divided upon his death.
The citizen must retain the right to transmit
most of his property through his last will
and testament. Men like to enjoy freely the
results of their work. It is a serious mistake
to deprive them of such precious property
that reflects their efforts, or to impose upon
them a malevolent division of their property
with the public treasury. Men keep their zeal
for work and they persevere to economize in
proportion as they are guaranteed the benefits
of their work and their right to transmit them
to their family. To suppress that perspective
is to kill their energy and stifie their ambition. The right to property and its corollary,
the right to dispose of it by will, are the
necessary elements of social order placed
upon two bases: respect for the human being

AUGUST 14, 1958
and respect for bis family. It is the duty of
the state to do ail within its power to maintain such a social order.
The present law, by penalizing labour, by
reducing the freedom to dispose by will,
seems to contradict the ideal toward wbich
ail well-organized countries must tend and
to misunderstand democracy in its basic
principles.
Before analyzing certain aspects of this
proposed act, I will summarize what I have
just said:
(1) Estate taxes and succession duties,
except in case of war, should be mostly lef t
to the provinces, and so federal taxes should
be limited to a nominal figure for the control
of income tax payments and to large estates
where, however, such taxation should not be
considered confiscatory.
(2) Modest successions, if they are to be
taxed, should be taxed moderately, in order
to encourage Canadians to work to keep their
ambition to create family enterprises and to
economize.
Let us now examine the terrible taxation
results that flow from this legislation: (1)
concerning the wif e; (2) concerning the chuldren; (3) concerning the residence; (4) concerning the high taxation on descendents;
(5) concerning family businesses; (6) concerning annuities and pensions; (7) concerning insurance policies; (8) concerning the
valuation of the estate; (9) concerning the
gifts.
I do not want to expand at any very great
length on each of these items, but I do want
to express my opinion on the most important
matters which the Canadian people have to
deal witb every day, and which form the
foundation of the life of our country. We
cannot expect a great development of Canada
in the next century unless we stop breaking down the family and get away f roma extravagances in taxation which are imposed
upon our people.
Concerning the wif e: I do not think anybody will question the help that a wife gives
ber husband in accumnulating the savings
that he leaves when he dies. If the act
recognizes at least ini part the obligations of
the husband toward his widow and cbildren,
it will help in only a small way in leaving
the family in a position identical to the one
in which it was before the death of the
husband. It is only the legal obligation of
the husband which. la recognized, flot the
work of the wife, or what she has earned;
it is only a recognition that the husband when
he died owed bis wife and children a natural
obligation, as 'well as a civil obligation, inposed by the laws of every province in Canada. As the honourable senator froin Toronto
(Hfon. Mr. Hayden) said this afternoon, it is

flot regarded as a debt of the husband to his
wife; it is merely an amount of $60,000. The
husband can leave bis whole fortune to bis
mistress, and she would get the benefit of the
$60,00OO exemption. In other words, in Canada the mistress and the wife are considered
on the same level in that regard. The money
could be left to a perfect stranger, who
would have to pay no taxation on the $60,000,
the amount of the estate supposed to be exempted for the benefit of the widow. I
repeat, the exemption of $60,00O is recognized
only as the obligation of the husband to bis
widow, and no recognition is given to the
work that she has done during their
married life to help ber busband accumulate
a fortune.
Hon. Mr. Thorvaldson: Will the honourable
senator agree that under tbe present act
a man can leave $50,000 to bis mistress
witbout any tax, as well as to bis widow?
Is tbat not a fair statement?
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: I say that bis mistress
is treated in the saine way as bis wife.
Hon. Mr. Thorvaldson: But that is not a
criticisin of the proposed measure, because
is it not true that under the present act a man
can leave $50,000 to a mistress without tax,
if bis estate is $50,000 or less?
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: Tbe present act does
not tax successions below $50,000, to wbomever or wberever tbey may go.
Hon. Mr. Thoîvaldson: Tbat is wbat I
mean.
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: But in the proposed
taxation it is not that at ail. An exemption
of $60,O00 is granted if the man is married.
It is because the man is married that tbe
amount is set at $60,000, but the amount can
go to bis widow or mistress without making
any difference as far as the exemption is
concerned.
Hon. Mr. Thorvadmon: But tbere is a
$50,000 exemption, wbether tbe man is
married or not.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I rise on a point of
order.
Yesterday at the request of the
bonourable senior senator fromn Winnipeg
(Hon. Mr. Haig) it was decided that questions should not be asked while an honourable senator was making a speech and I was
forbidden to asic a question. Are we going to
change the rule today?
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: I must say that I do not,
mind being asked questions at ail-I rather
like it.
Hon. Mr. Thorvaldson: I knew the bonourable senator would rather like questions to
be asked.

SENATE
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: In answer to the hon-

ourable senator from Winnipeg South (Hon.
Mr. Thorvaldson), I may say this $50,000
exemption applies generally whether the man
is married or not, and regardless of whom
he leaves his estate to. An estate valued
at less than $50,000 is not taxed. The reason
for that is that the Government was shy about
taxing successions below $50,000; it felt that
it was not worth while to do so, as collection
costs would probably exceed the amount of
tax on such estates. In every country there
is an amount which is exempt from taxation.
That is true of the United States and all the
provinces of Canada. In the province of
Quebec, for instance, the exemption is $20,000,
and I think it is the same in Ontario. I
believe that in most of the states of the
United States the exemption is $50,000, while
in other states it runs as high as $75,000.
My point is that the amount of $60,000
which is exempt from taxation under this
bill because a man is married is not the
exemption given to the wife only, but it is
given to anybody. It is not owing to the
fact that a man is responsible to his wife
that $60,000 is exempt from taxation, but on
account of the fact that he is married.
Whether she receives it or not does not
matter. Well, in that respect I say that the
capital allowed to the family is barely
sufficient to provide enough revenue to eat
three times a day. I would like every member
of this house to make a calculation of the
amount of capital that would be allowed to
a poor widow who has nothing at all, who
worked all her life with her husband to accumulate a certain amount, maybe $60,000,
$75,000 or $100,000. Just consider what will
be left after payment of the estate tax.
Include in the calculation the value of the
deceased's home, which I am going to talk
about in a minute, and include the value of
the movable effects garnishing the house, both
of which go to make up the taxable amount
of the estate.

on a proper level. Let us take this opportunity to discard these inequities which exist
in the act at present, maybe in the worst
way.
On that point let me refer to something
that does not appear in the bill. The present
act recognizes ties that exist between a
husband and his wife, between a man and
his children, and between a man and his
grandchildren. All these tics are recognized
in the act in force at the present time but
they are not recognized in the bill before us.
If honourable senators were to make the
calculation I suggested they would find that
the capital left after taxation would allow
barely enough revenue for three meals a
day, and maybe decent clothing; and if some
of the children of the family are to be
educated the rest of the family will have to
go to work. In most cases the poor wife has
to go to work after her husband dies, otherwise she cannot make ends meet.
Hon. Mr. Howard: That is right.
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: And out of the estate
do you know how much is going to the state,
what amount is being taken away from that
poor woman who has barely enough capital
allowed to her to earn income sufficient to
provide three meals a day, and to feed and
clothe her children decently and have them
educated?
On $100,000 taxable the tax
amounts to $19,000, and on $200,000 it is,
$44,000. That is what is taken away from
the wife and the children.
Hon. Mr. Thorvaldson: But, that is not as
bad as it is under the present act, is it?

Hon. Mr. Bouffard: No; I admit that.
Hon. Mr. Thorvaldson: You admit that the
bill is more lenient than the present act?
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: I have made no calculation as to what is taken away from the wife
and children under the present act. I am
looking at the bill that is before us and
what it proposes to do. I repeat, on a
$100,000 taxable asset the taxation is $19,000,
Hon. Mr. Thorvaldson: Would the honour- and on a $200,000 taxable asset it is $44,000.

Hon. Mr. Bouffard: They will pay whether
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: Of course, but I am they have the cash or not.
That is the way the Canadian family is
of the same opinion as the honourable
senator from Toronto, that while we are treated at the present time. It is horrible.
It is confiscation. It is much worse in the
discussing the bill we are also discussing the case of the average-sized fortune than
it is

to put the whole system of estates taxation case of a $1 million or a $2 million estate,

AUGUST 14, 1958
if 55 per cent or 56 per cent of it is taken,
what remains will be enough to educate the
children of that family and to permit the
family to live as they were living before.
But when you take away nearly 25 per cent

of an estate of $100,000 or $200,000 that is
left to the wife and children, I say that is
confiscation; it is taking away capital that
the family needs to live on. And for what
purpose is it taken away?
It seems to me that if the Government
would be willing to make a wee bit of
effort, not a big one, it could save $10 million or $11 million in the course of a year,
which would be all that is needed to abandon
all taxation on estates except the large ones.
Then the poor people who have worked
all their lives to create a modest estate would
be relieved of all the expense and confiscation that the state now applies to them. If
the Government would only look around and
save $11 million a year somewhere, that
could be done. I am all in favour, honourable
senators, of the gifts Canada makes to
people, whether they live in Canada or not,
who are in need of money, clothing, flour or
wheat. I am glad that we can do it, but it
seems to me that charity should begin at
home. If the giving of gifts means putting
Canadian families into difficulties, as we
are doing at the present time by taxing the
estates, we should stop making these gifts.
The country is in a position to make gifts
abroad when it has the means to do so, but
when it has to exercise serious confiscation
in order to do so it seems to me that the
making of such gifts should be stopped.
What can we do? I am not going to push
the matter to the extreme, but can we not
do something to recognize the work of the
wife in helping her husband during the
course of their married life? What can we
do to minimize the effect of these heavy
succession and estate taxes?
Well, honourable senators, I have a
suggestion to make. I would say that the
work of the wife in a family, the contribution
that she has made to the accumulation of the
family fortune, varies greatly in different
families. For instance, if a man has amassed
$1 million I do not think it can be said that
his wife, except in rare circumstances, worked
toward the accumulation of it to the degree
that she should get half without being taxed.
But I do say that in the case of a modest
estate-let us say up to $200,000-the wife
should get at least half of it without having
to pay any tax, if her husband left her that
amount. In that way she would receive
$100,000 exempt from taxation. Where an
estate is left to a stranger I am not asking
that any portion of it be made non-taxable.
But in the case of a $200,000 fortune, I
repeat, it seems only fair to recognize the

work that the wife has contributed to its
accumulation and that one half of it should be
exempt, in her hands.
The province of Quebec recognizes the
principle of community of property. Under
the régime of community of property-which
is the ordinary régime of marriage in the
province of Quebec-when the husband dies
the widow receives half of the estate without
paying a cent of tax. Now, is that because
she has worked more than a woman who
married under the régime of separation of
property? They both work the same. When
the husband and wife married, perhaps at
the age of 21 or 22, they did not realize the
consequences of the matrimonial régime.
Hon. Mr. Monette: Will the honourable
senator allow a question?
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: Yes, of course.
Hon. Mr. Monette: The honourable senator
has referred to the case of a married couple
having a fortune of about $200,000.
In
Quebec, when the parties are married under
provisions of community of property, is half
of the estate transmitted to the wife on
the death of her husband, or is it her own
property?
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: It is her own property.
Hon. Mr. Monette: There is no transmission
at all.
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: No transmission. And
I am not asking that any change be made
in that regard. I am not asking for any
change for the man who has a fortune of
$200,000 and was married under the régime
of separation.
Hon. Mr. Monette: It is not exempt from
taxation; it is her own property.
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: It is her own property.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Is she taxed under
the present dominion law?
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: Not for half the property. I am requesting that for estates up
to $200,000 the widow, whether she is married under the régime of separation or under
the régime of community of property, shail
have her work recognized by the taxation
authority and inherit half of the estate without paying any tax. That is what she should
get for the work she has done. After all,
the Government would not lose anything by
that, for when the widow dies her heirs
will have to pay the succession duty on what
she got from her husband.
Women's organizations from across Canada
have made a tremendous appeal to the Government to have it acknowledge in some
form or other that the work a wife does in
her husband's lifetime should be recognized

SENATE
from a taxation standpoint. At a meeting
of the Banking and Commerce Committee
of the other house this proposal was submitted to the minister, and he refused to
accept that point of view because he did rot
want to encroach upon provincial rights.
Well, if there is any encroachment upon
provincial rights it is not because the minister proposes to reduce the tax, but rather,
it seems to me, because the tax is imposed.
What is he going to change by allowing a
married woman to receive a share of what
she, with her husband, has earned in her
lifetime, without having to pay tax on it?
What is going to be changed with respect
to what belongs to the Civil Code? I say,
nothing at all. There is no matrimonial
régime change; it remains exactly the same.
It is the husband's right to will his estate
as he chooses; and, as a matter of fact, if he
does not bequeath the property to his wife
she does not benefit by the tax exemption. If
the federal Government has a right to impose
the tax it also has the right to allow any
deduction that is necessary or convenient.
After all, the Government has already decreed
that the first $60,000, in the case of a married man, will be deductible. All we are
asking for, in the name of the women of
Canada, is that this amount be increased to
one-half of estates of $200,000. Does the
minister encroach upon civil rights in allowing a deduction of $60,000? Why should there
be an encroachment upon civil rights if he
extends that right to $100,000 or more. The
minister's answer on this point, I suggest,
was not a very serious one.
I wish to deal next with the position of
children, and in that regard I have only one
suggestion to make. The estate enjoys a
deduction for a child of 21 years and under.
All I am asking in this respect is that the
age of the exempted child be extended from
21 to 25 years, provided the child is following a regular course at a college or
university. It seems to me that is the most
expensive time of a child's life. This fact is
recognized by the income tax law. If we
follow the income tax law so closely with
respect to making the avoidance of tax law
more difficult, and protect the right of the
Government to go in and take away books
and seize other articles, why then should
the same rights not be extended to children
affected under estate taxation? Therefore, I
suggest that for a young man or young
woman between the ages of 21 and 25 who is
following a regular college or university
course a deduction of $15,000 be allowed.
I have a few words to say concerning the
family residence. The Government has done
many things to encourage people to build and
own their own residences. We have many

Crown companies which up to the present
time have spent a lot of money and have
guaranteed mortgages ranging from 25 to 30
years, and in some cases longer; we have
reduced the amount of interest payable on
mortgages and have done many other things
to encourage Canadians to own their own
homes. Therefore, it seems to me that, subject to certain limitations, people who have
been encouraged to own their own homes
should not be discouraged from doing so by
the imposition of an estate tax every time
the house changes hands within members of
the family. I would propose that a residence
left by a husband to his family, where they
resided with him before he died, and the
furnishings of that house, be exempted up
to $25,000. I do not go so far as to suggest
that very fine, princely houses be exempted
from succession duty. I only say that to
exempt a house with its movable effects to
the value of $25,000 seems extremely reasonable. I would move, therefore, that the
residence occupied by the deceased and his
family at the time of his death be exempt up
to $25,000.
I should like to say a few words about the
application of estates taxation to the portion
of an estate bequeathed to the family, and
that bequeathed to strangers. I do not intend
to dwell long on this question, because the
honourable senator from Toronto (Hon. Mr.
Hayden) in his speech this afternoon made a
statement on that point which seems to me
very clear. The honourable senator from
Hanover (Hon. Mr. Brunt) also touched on
that point.
It makes me sad when I think that the
wife, the children and the grandchildren of
a man, for whom all the work of his life
is devoted, would carry the same application
of estate taxation as that which applies to
total strangers. With the excessive rates of
taxation that are imposed by this act, it
seems to me we should make a difference
between that portion of the assets left to
the children and that left to strangers. After
all, honourable senators, the law which we
are now studying exempts from taxation
gifts to charitable or educational institutions.
But if a man dares make a gift to his wife,
his son or his grandchild, it immediately
becomes taxable by law. It seems to me
unreasonable that this should be so. Is it
not true that you give to a charitable or
educational institution, only after you have
provided for your own?
It is a surplus
amount which may or may not cause some
sacrifices in the family; for instance, you
may give up a trip or a new automobile in
order to make a donation to a charitable or
educational institution, but you do not do so
if you have not enough for your own family.

AUGUST 14. 1958
Therefore, if we are to provide for exemptions with respect to gifts to these institutions, should not the same exemptions apply
to gifts made by a deceased husband to his
wife or descendants?
I intend to propose that the rates on the
first $500,000 taxable shall remain on the
same basis, but that if the bequest is to the
wife or the children the tax shall be cut in
half. The main reason for the existence of
an estate tax is the facility with which the
amount can be calculated. The amendment
I have in mind will not make that more
difficult. The tax will be calculated in the
same way as before, and the only change
which would have to be made is to cut the
amount in two. No classes are taken into
account except the wife and the descendants.
At the same time I do not take the view
that, if the tax were more difficult to calculate, that would be a good reason why
children should not be treated better than
strangers. In any event that difficulty is
avoided. The children and the wife will have
better treatment than strangers, and a more
difficult calculation will not be imposed upon
the officers of the department.
I come now to the position of family businesses. I do not want to spend much time
on this, because it has already been discussed.
I believe all honourable senators realize that
throughout Canada, and perhaps more particularly in Quebec and Ontario, there are
a tremendous number of family businesses.
A man founds a small business or industry
and carries it on all his life, with the idea of
leaving it to his children and their successors.
Quebec has a tremendous number of these
family businesses. It seems to me that they
are an important part of the backbone of our
economy. A man is furnished with ambition
to work; he works for himself, and especially
for his family; he wants to leave to them an
industry or a trade which is in good financial
position. All his life he makes sacrifices. He
takes practically no dividends from the earnings of the business because he wants to
retain the money to have the business in good
financial condition, when he dies, for the
sake of his children. Ail this is good for
Canadians and for the country, so why break
or damage it? At the present time it is corporations of this kind which are most badly
treated. To my mind they should be supported
so far as possible. The proposition I would
make in this respect is a very simple one. I
do not wish to reduce the amount of taxation
in favour of such family businesses, but I
want to give the owner or the successor of
the family industry five years to pay his tax
with interest.

Hon. Mr. Bruni: The same system as in the
United States.
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: Exactly-where they do
encourage these businesses, and it is a good
thing they are encouraged. One of the important elements of ambition is the incentive
to a man to work for his wife and his family.
I repeat that this is not a proposal to reduce
the tax, simply that the heirs shall have five
years to pay, in equal instalments, carrying
interest. It is impossible for a man owning
a family business to sell it in the course of
six months. If he must get rid of it in that
time he will sacrifice it-dispose of it for
nothing, or in many cases he will not be able
to sell. So let us not try to force sales. Give
the heirs five years to pay the tax, with
interest, and if they sell the business sooner
they will pay at once. As has been said, this
is the principle which is adopted in the
United States; it is a good one, and the one
I am going to propose in this connection.
Concerning annuities and pensions: this
matter, I think, has been sufficiently discussed
by the two honourable senators who preceded
me. My point of view-and it is the only
difference between those who spoke before
me and myself, on that point-is that I believe the tax should be imposed only on the
capital, not on the interest. The capital which
is necessary to produce the annuity is deposited with an insurance company. The same
principle is followed by insurance companies
in relation to pensions, annuities, and the rest.
The insurance company, before the annuity
becomes due, receives the capital and the
interest: it calculates how long the man is
going to live. It calculates the interest that
the capital will produce until the annuity is
payable, the interest it will produce after the
commencement of the annuity, and the cost
of administration. Is it proper that the total
amount should be subject to estate tax? I
say that just the capital should be included,
because after all on the interest produced
there is already tax on income, and that is
double taxation.
Hon. Mr. Bruni: I think that under the
terms of the present Income Tax Act you
can set up for yourself an annuity out of
funds upon which no income tax has been
paid.
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: Yes.
Hon. Mr. Bruni: Well then, I take the
reverse position, that the tax should be paid,
because this money is going to come out of
the annuitant, and no income tax has already
been paid on ilt.
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: I do not object to thatas it comes out. But there should be no
estate tax on the interest, because it did not

SENATE
exist at the time of the death. No interest
had yet been produced. It did not exist at
the time of the death, so in capitalizing the
interest that is going to be paid over a 10or a 15-year period you tax something which
does not exist. It is not capital. This amount
of interest, when it becomes due and payable, is going to carry an income tax payment with it.
Hon. Mr. Bruni: That is right.
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: Take the example that
was given this afternoon of a man who
leaves his widow a $4,000 annuity. Let us
say for the purpose of discussion that this
annuity is going to be valued at $50,000.
Incidentally, an annuity of $50,000 usually
carries about $12,000 by way of succession
duties. The widow has six years to pay,
say, at the rate of $2,000 a year. After she
has paid the full income tax and succession

duties in six years there will not be much
left for her. And, mind you, if she should
die in the first year, after she has been
paid only $100 or $200, her estate is left
with an indebtedness of about $12,000, of
which she has not received a cent. That is
what happens in our taxation of annuities
at the present time. It is simply horrible.
My proposition is this. I don't want to
change the tax on annuities, but I say that
we should distribute the amount of the tax
to be paid during the expected lifetime of
the widow, and if she dies before having
attained the expected age, let the tax stop;
otherwise, the estate will pay tax on something the widow has not received. I don't
want to go any further into this aspect of
the bill, because it has already been treated
quite fully by the other members.
The matter of insurance policies has also
been talked about. There is only one point
I want to add. I believe insurance policies
made payable to the Minister of Finance for
the purpose of paying succession duties should
not be added to the succession. It seems
to me that a man paying income tax and
saving a premium which cost him 150 per
cent, if you calculate the income tax, has
paid enough for his insurance; and if it is
turned over to the Minister of Finance for
the purpose of paying succession duties it
seems to me that the amount of money so
provided for the payment of tax and retained
by the minister should not be added to the
capital of the estate and taxed over again.
As a matter of fact, it is a tax on a tax,
because the amount has been accumulated just
for the purpose of paying the tax. The premium be paid has already been taxed as
income.
As to valuation of an estate, I do not think
I need say much on that, for the honourable

gentleman from Toronto has made the suggestion that I was going to make. I was
going to suggest that the period for valuation of an estate be extended to one year
after death, but I am satisfied that six months
would be all right. That is, the valuation
should not be considered at the date of death,
but over a period of six months.
Let us take the case of an estate which was
entirely composed of federal, provincial,
municipal and school bonds. Most of them,
if the death occurred in April 1957, would
have been valued very highly-at par, if
not above par. Two months afterwards the
same federal bonds would have lost between
5 per cent and 10 per cent in value; the
provincial bonds would have lost between
10 per cent and 12 per cent in value, and
the municipal and school bonds of the best
category would have lost anything up to 25
per cent. But the calculation of the tax
would have been made according to the value
on the day of death, which seems to me
totally unjust and unreasonable. Sometimes
the tax is paid on a fictitious value which
exists at the time of death, which is about
par. Well, the estate is the loser. Let us
say that the man, instead of investing his
money in bonds invested it in mining stock
-and
we must have individuals who will
invest in mining stocks, if we are to develop
our natural resources. Well, in April 1957
he was a wealthy man, but in June 1957 he
was a poor man.
Hon. Mr. Bruni: The worst example is
that of the man who died on October 28,
1929, the day before the big crash. One
day his stocks had an extremely high value
and the next day they were not worth 50
per cent of that.
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: And his estate was
ruined.
Hon. Mr. Bruni: That's right.
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: It is reasonable that
a person should pay taxes, but I say there is
a mode of valuation which is exorbitant and
which only means that a man is taxed on a
fictitious value.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Supposing the stocks
go up during the six months?
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: Well, he will pay higher
taxes.
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West):
necessarily; he is given a choice.
Hon. Mr. Bouffard:

where succession duties are extremely high,

Hon. Mr. Howard: Yes, in the United States
it is 12 months.
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: In England it is 12
months too, and he can make a choice. Here
in Canada you find people in the position of
having to pay a tax on a valuation that does
not exist; whereas in England and in the
United States they realize this is not a practical way to do it. I would suggest that a
similar choice be given to the taxpayer in
Canada.
Honourable senators, the last point I wish
to make concerns gifts. I feel the gifts which
have been made by the deceased, and which
are permitted by the income tax law to be
made without payment of gift tax should also
be considered as gifts under the Succession
Duty Act and not taxable if made within
three years preceding death.
For instance, a man can give away $1,000
as many times as he wants to in the course
of one year without having to pay a donation tax. If this money has been given to
his wife, children or grandchildren within
three years preceding his demise it is added
to the succession and the estate has to pay
succession duties on it. I propose that the
value of these gifts should not be added
to the amount of the succession unless they
exceed 25 per cent of his total estate. If
we have the right, as I said a moment ago,
to make gifts to the charitable institutions
without paying a cent of tax, it seems to
me that we should have a chance to give
part of our fortune to our family within
three years preceding our death, without
paying any tax. In other words, a man
can give the whole of his assets to charitable
institutions without paying a tax, but the
same law does not permit him to give even
a small portion of his fortune to his children
without paying tax.
Honourable senators, I have one more comment to make. Let us say a foreigner not
domiciled in Canada deposits money for any
purpose in a bank in Canada. If he dies
outside of Canada this money is going to
be taxed as a succession duty. Incidentally,
I can assure you that a lot of wealthy
Europeans wish to deposit money in our
banks, which would earn interest and help
develop our country. Well, with the taxation that we have at the present time that
will be impossible, because they will not
deposit here if they are going to be taxed
for succession duties in the event of death.
They can deposit it in any bank in the
United Sates and succession duty is not imposed. Why can we not permit the same

thing in Canada? If we do not do so we
shall lose all of these deposits, which will
mean losing money that can be loaned by
the banks for the development of our country.
Honourable senators, thank you very much
for having listened to me for such a long
time. I have spoken longer than I had intended, but I feel that I would not have done
my duty toward the Senate and the progress
of Canada if I had not make these remarks
in respect to this legislation. I hope that in
the Senate we shall be able to make reasonable amendments to the bill to the advantage of Canada and its people. That is
all I ask.
Hon. George S. White: Honourable senators, I wish to make a few brief remarks
before this bill is sent to committee.
I commend the honourable senator who
introduced the bill (Hon. Mr. Thorvaldson),
as well as the honourable senators from
Toronto (Hon. Mr. Hayden), Hanover (Hon.
Mr. Brunt) and Grandville (Hon. Mr.
Bouffard).
It seems to me that this bill presents an
opportunity and a challenge to this chamber,
because in the short time that I have been
here this is by far the most important bill
that has come before us. In this house there
are many members of the legal profession
from the two central provinces, each of which
has at present a provincial succession duty
act. I feel that the Senate is now presented
with a glorious opportunity, not only to do
a great job for all the people of Canada but
to answer in a fine, creditable way much of
the criticism of the Senate in the press.
An honourable senator said today that perhaps he was old-fashioned. Well, I am very
old-fashioned, because I have always been
opposed to the imposition of succession duty
by any government. I do not think this is
an occasion to discuss whether we should
uphold the old act and compare it with the
new one, but if we must have this legislation
we should certainly remove the many injustices, the inequalities, and the things that
are unfair in the bill now presented to us.
The one good feature of the proposed new
act, if one can call anything in it a good
feature, is that at last there is a basic extension of the exemption.
Comments have been made in the other
place, both in the house and in committee,
as to the simplification of the proposed new
act, and how easy it is going to be to administer. All I have to say on that is that if
any honourable senator who has read Bill
C-37 carefully and attempted to digest it
can say that it is a simple bill, he deserves
a medal of some kind. I think it is going
to be much more expensive to administerHon. Mr. Howard: Hear, hear.

SENATE
Hon. Mr. White: -both from the point of
view of legal fees and, as the honourable
senator from Hanover (Hon. Mr. Brunt)
pointed out, of difficulties of the executor
over the four-year period. If that is followed
further, and the executor has to keep certain
assets under his control, or if there is a
question of a bond, of audits, of income tax,
and other things, I think there will be a
tremendous amount of extra expense in the
administration of the proposed act, which
bas been held out to us as a very simple one.
The first act was brought in as a war
measure, in 1941-at least, I considered it as
a war measure-when the country needed
the money. At that time the rate was very
high, estates over $5,000 being taxed. Prior
to World War II there may have been some
justification for succession duty, because up
to that time income tax, as we know it today,
simply did not exist. But today any assets
in an estate represent, except in the case
of capital gains, the energy, work and industry of a man and his wife, and to gain
them the husband has already paid a very
high and, in my opinion, often an excessive
income tax.
The honourable senator who sponsored the
bill stated that Ontario was the first province
to introduce succession duty. The honourable
senator from Grandville said that his province introduced succession duty in the same
year. Whichever province introduced it first,
it is no credit to it.
Honourable senators, we talk much in Parliament about our freedom, how much it
means to us and how it has to be preserved.
We all pay great lip service to private enterprise. Yet when a bill like this one comes
before us perhaps we realize how much the
individual in Canada today is controlled by
the state. Not only has he very heavy income tax to pay, but in many cases be must
pay tax on gifts to his family, and when he
dies his estate is subject, at least in Ontario,
to both provincial and federal succession
duties.
Succession duty has been described as a
tax that robs the dead. Another definition
describes it as legalized robbery. Members
of the legal profession who have had a great
deal of experience in administering estates
know only too well just how heavily the
two succession duties, along with income tax,
bear on an estate. There is much comment
in the briefs that were sent to members of the
Senate and of the other place as to the
benefit that is going to accrue in having what
is called an estate tax instead of the tax as
we now know it, paid by the beneficiary of the
successor. I wonder if the present way is
not much the better way, because both in
Ontario and under the present dominion tax

the degree of relationship is recognized, and
it is evidenced by the various degrees in
which the tax is levied.
At the present time in Ontario there is
no tax up to $50,000 if the property goes
to husband or wife, or son or daughter, and
other beneficiary in that class; but in Ontario
if an estate of over $10,000 goes to brother,
sister, niece, or anyone in that class, it is
taxed. If it goes to a stranger,itis taxable on
the amount over $5,000. It is quite true there is
a different set-up under the present Dominion
Succession Duty Act, but I would emphasize,
honourable senators, that in both the Ontario
act and the dominion act there is recognition
of the degree of relationship in setting the
amount of the tax. I for one cannot quite see
how you can justify the proposed method of
the same rate of tax for every degree of
relationship. Surely no one is going to argue
that a husband or wife, or son or daughter,
has not the right to expect more from their
parents than a total stranger; yet a total
stranger, a nephew or niece, on any legacy
is taxed at the same rate as a closer relative
to the deceased.
The honourable senator who introduced the
bill mentioned the fact that there would
be no tax on any estate up to $50,000. Then
he explained the basic exemption of $40,000
in the estate that is taxable; but yet if you get
up an example of an estate of $60,000 going
to sons and daugthers who are over the age
of 21 years, you find you are taxed on $20,000.
Well, in an estate of $50,000 going to sons
and daughters all over 21, or going to anyone,
there will be no tax. Now, I think there is
an inconsistency there. To correct this the
basic exemption should be at least $50,000.
Hon. Mr. Thorvaldson: Is the honourable
senator referring to the proposed act or to
the present act in regard to these figures he
has given?
Hon. Mr. White: Under the present act
$50,000 is exempt, but under bill C-37 you
said yesterday that any estate up to $50,000
was not taxable.
Hon. Mr. Thorvaldson: Oh, no. An estate
of $50,000 or less is exempt from taxation,
but that is an entirely different thing from
saying that there is a complete exemption.
Hon. Mr. White: Under this bill C-37 I
cannot see that any estate up to $50,000 is
subject to tax.
Hon. Mr. Thorvaldson: That is $50,000.
Hon. Mr. White: On $50,000 or less there
is no tax.

Then in an estate of $50,000 going to anyone there is no tax; in an estate of $60,000
going to anyone, or going to sons or daughters

AUGUST 14, 1958
over 21 years of age, there is a basic exemption of $40,000, and it is then taxed on
$20,000.
Hon. Mr. Thorvaldson: No.
Hon. Mr. White: To anyone over 21 years
of age.
Hon. Mr. Bruni: Who dies without spouse.
Hon. Mr. White: Now, that is inconsistent
and I think it should be corrected. It has
already been mentioned that there is an exemption of $60,000 for the widow and $10,000
for the children and so on. There certainly
is no misunderstanding about it, because the
explanatory note that appears opposite page
9 states that the new deductions are not
specific as to the persons concerned, and are
applicable whether or not these persons receive a benefit from the estate.
Now, I do not wish to add anything to the
very capable remarks that have already been
made by other honourable senators covering
that point, but there is another example
where it is different from the present provincial act and the dominion act. There, if
the money goes to the widow she has a
certain exemption, and there is a certain exemption for the children. Take the case of
an estate of $105,000, all going to the widow,
and deduct debts amounting to $5,000. She
has an exemption of $60,000; so, she is taxed
on $40,000. The federal tax is $6,200, subject
to whatever adjustment there may be from
the provincial tax.
Now, the honourable senator who just
took his place (Hon. Mr. Bouffard) dealt
with the next matter that I wish to refer to,
having to do with the value of the family
residence. It seems to me that in allowing
an exemption of $60,000 for a widow,
sufficient consideration has not been given
to the enormous increase in the value of
real estate, such as summer cottage property,
etc. In 1951 the figure was raised to $50,000,
and it was provided that no estate up to that
amount would be subject to duty. Well, if
that was a fair figure in 1951, I do not think
anyone would argue that that amount would
be fair today.
In my opinion if the provisions in the
present federal act were retained as to the
degree of relationship, the exemptions to
the widow and to the children should be
greatly increased; then there could be a
graduated scale of exemptions for the other
degrees of relationship and for strangers,
along with a graduated scale of tax, and in
the end I think the department would collect
more money than they will collect under Bill
C-37.
The honourable senator who introduced the
bill (Hon. Mr. Thorvaldson) stated that the

reduction in taxes to the federal Government
would run about 10 per cent, of present
collections. I have a statement of the duty
collected by the dominion Government in the
years 1948 to 1957. In round figures, the
following amounts were collected: in 1951,
$34 million; 1952, $38 million; 1953, $38
million; 1954, $39 million; 1955, $44 million.
In 1956 and in 1957 there was a big increase,
but I think that most honourable senators
realize the increase in those two years was
due to the collections from two large estates.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: What were the
amounts in those two years?
Hon. Mr. White: In 1956, $66 million, and
in 1957, $79 million.
So, if you take the average year as running
from $38 million to $40 million, the decrease
in revenue would amount to only $4 million
annually, which is a small amount when
spread over all the estates in Canada.
Section 3 (1) (f) of the bill reads as follows:
There shall be included in computing the aggregate net value of the property passing on the
death of a person(f) Property held jointly by the deceased and
one or more other persons, to the extent of the
beneficial interest therein arising or accruing by
survivorship or otherwise on the death of the
deceased.

And on the opposite page the explanatory
note reads:
The deceased's share of the joint property is to
be determined according to the extent of his
interest in it and not the extent of his contributions
te it as required under section 3 (1) (e).

In his testimony before the Banking and
Commerce Committee of the House of Conmons, as reported in that Committee's Minutes
of Proceedings and Evidence, pamphlet No.
1, at page 17, the Minister of Finance stated
that joint property would not be included
in the estate. It is rather hard to imagine
this provision being included in the bill in
view of the minister's statement.
Section 43 of the bill provides for the
placing of a lien for taxes on property situated in Canada, and it reads:
-the minister may cause to be registered in the
appropriate land titles or land registry office a
caution of lien in prescribed form specifying the
amount of such lien claimed under this act.

It does not say that be shall cause a lien
to be registered. When this matter was discussed in the House of Commons the Minister of Finance went to some pains to
draw attention to the great importance to
be attached to section 43.
At page 3404 of the House of Commons
Hansard the minister is reported as follows:
-because
of the existence of this statutory lien
created by clause 43 it will be the responsibility of
persons dealing with property in which a deceased
person had an interest, where his successors or

listen to this:
the purchaser will have the same responcast upon him for his own protection-of
sure that the estate tax bas been paid-

Of course the best evidence of that would

be the production of the estate tax release
in respect of that particular estate.
Now, the minister did not say that the
production of the estate tax release would
be sufficient or conclusive-he did not go
that far-for the wording of section 43 is
very plain, that there is a lien on all land
in Canada until all the taxes are paid. I
wonder how the average solicitor is going

to satisfy his client who purchases realty
from an estate, that he is getting a clear
title, free of any succession duty taxes that
may come up.

Hon. Mr. Euler: You can't be sure of it
for four years, anyway.
Hon. Mr. White: No, you can't be sure for
four years.

Treasurer issues a certificate for registration

seems to me that it would not be very diffi-

cult to have some similar system under the
The federal release states,

"Consent is hereby given to the delivery,
assignment, transfer, or payment of . . .",
and then follows a description of the asset.
On the face of it this release would appear

to be sufficient, but I cannot see how it can
be accepted as sufficient in view of the provisions of section 43. That is one of the few
things which, in my opinion, are going to
cause difficulty in the transfer of realty and
will add considerable expense to the admin-

how far you would get in that respect. As
I read section 43 there is no loophole in it,
release or no release.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: What does the section
say?
Hon. Mr. White: It reads:
Any amount payable as tax, interest or penalties
under this Act by a person as the successor to any
property passing on the death of a deceased shall,
where the property to which that person is the
successor consists in whole or in part of land
situated in Canada or any estate or interest in any
such land, be and continue to be for as long as
that amount or any part thereof remains unpaid
a lien upon such land or such estate or interest in
favour of Her Majesty, and the Minister may cause
to be registered in the appropriate land titles or
land registry office a caution of lien in prescribed
form specifying the amount of such lien then
claimed under this Act and shall thereupon by
registered mail notify each person appearing by
the records of such office as having any estate
or interest in such land of his action.
I think that section is very plain. If it
said the minister shall within a certain reasonable time file a caution in the registry

office, then you would have some protection
in the registry office.
Honourable senators, there is also the ques-

tion of interest. These are small points. There
is a 5 per cent penalty charged by the Government, but it pays only 3 per cent on
over-payments; yet, where there is a decision
by the nlinister or by the court, interest is
allowed on over-payment at 5 per cent. Surely
that is inconsistent.
The act specifically sets out that no change
has been made by way of allowing deductions
for executors' fees or legal fees in the administration of estates. Certainly the beneficiary

does not receive that part of the estate.

apply?
Hon. Mr. White: No, I would not take that
at all. You have had enough experience in
dealing with Government officials to know

Hon. Mr. Aselline: The filing fee.
Hon. Mr. White: So the provincial and the
federal Governments have shown some
recognition in this respect. They recognize

AUGUST 14, 1958
that the deceased must be buried, and they
allow those expenses; they also recognize that
the estate must be administered, and they
allow a very small part of that cost. In Ontario
we call it the Surrogate Court fees.
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): Of how
much?
Hon. Mr. White: The actual court fees on
the issue of probate.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: The Surrogate Court
fees.
Hon. Mr. White: Yes. I am saying that they
recognize that the estate must be administered.
There are certain expenses, and they allow
that item.
My contention is that if it is proper to
allow court fees, it is just as proper to allow
all other expenses in connection with the
administration of the estate, including all legal
expenses, disbursements and executors' fees.
These should be deducted before computing
succession duties. Now, in Ontario-and no
doubt the same applies in all other provinces
-we have a tariff set by the court for the
legal fees in the administration of an estate.
On the audit the court sets the amount of
the fee to be allowed to executors. I cannot
see any great difficulty in working out a flat
rate as a deduction for executors' fees and
legal fees, based on the value of the estate.
Quite true, in some cases the amount allowed
can be a little high, and in other cases it would
be low, but I think a fair and accurate basis
can be arrived at.
The honourable gentleman who spoke
before me indicated that he was satisfied with
the six-month period allowed for the payment
of duty without interest. Every lawyer knows
of some incidents where certain assets have
had to be sacrificed in order to obtain money
to pay duty before interest was charged on
it. The honourable gentleman was speaking
about what could happen in computing the
value of estates, and he mentioned that in
April or May of 1957 there was a considerable
drop in the value of bonds. I recall that I
had an estate in my office at that time which
had an asset of 650 shares of International
Nickel. Unfortunately, on the day on which
the deceased died that stock closed at a
value of $109 and some cents a share; by
the time the estate was in shape to be
administered the stock was down to $70; it
has gone as low as $69, and is at the present
time around $80 a share. This is another
illustration of the fact that if an executor is
forced to take the valuation of the estate on
the day the deceased dies, it is not always
fair.
I have heard it indicated that this bill is not
to come into force until January 1, 1959.
It was indicated yesterday by the honourable

senator who introduced the bill, when he read
a statement from someone in the Department
of Finance, that a very singular change would
be made when the bill comes into force, as
the duty would be a debt against the estate.
Now it is all very well, honourable senators,
to say that an individual should know the
law.
There are tens and hundreds of
thousands in Canada who will not see Hansard
and who will not know the significance of
this bill in relation to their wills. It is not
unusual for a father to give specific legacies
to his children and grandchildren and leave
the residue to his wife. Now, if he did not
change that will, it seems to me that the
grandchildren who are to get specific allowances will be paid in full, and the widow,
who gets the residue of the estate, will have
to pay all the succession duty. In that
respect the present system is not too bad.
I would point out that with the exception of
an amendment in 1951, it bas taken 17 years
for this act to be revised. It seems to me
therefore, that now we have the opportunity
we should scrutinize this bill very carefully
indeed.
In conclusion I wish to summarize a few
suggestions I have outlined.
1. Basic exemption for preferred beneficiaries, $100,000.
2. A graduated scale of exemptions for
other relatives and strangers, the graduation
being according to degree of relationship.
3. Extension of time for payment of duty
to at least twelve months.
4. Rate of interest on overpayment to be
at the same rate as charged by the
department.
5. A flat rate to be worked out for executors
and legal fees, and to be allowed as a
deduction from the value of the estate.
6. Provision for the protection of both the
executor and the purchaser in the sale of
realty.
7. Provision for advertising in the daily
press of the importance of the changes in
the act.
8. Provision to limit the personal liability
of the executor and to give him the right
to obtain a certificate of discharge.
9. Some provision as to the valuation of
the estate, with some option of continuing the
right to choose a date other than the date
of death.
Hon. W. Ross Macdonald: Honourable senators, I do not intend to take much of the
time of this bouse in discussing this bill. It
is, without doubt, one of the most important
measures which have been presented to us
this session, and I think I can say that the
present debate is one of the best that has
taken place in the house this year. The discussion has been very informative. I read

SENATE
daily reports of the debate in the other
house, and also the report of its committee
meetings, and so far as I am concerned I
have found the discussions here much more
informative, and presented in, shall I say,
a most judicial manner. No animosity bas
been evident, and no partisanship shown. I
thought the honourable senator from Winnipeg South (Hon. Mr. Thorvaldson) introduced the bill in the manner in which legislation such as this should be presented, and
set forth the main features without going
into too much detail. Every honourable senator who followed contributed greatly to the
debate. One thing I have noticed, and which
I think other honourable senators must have
observed, is that no one has come to the
rescue of the honourable senator who introduced the bill, by supporting it.
Hon. Mr. Bruni: We supported it with
changes which were thought necessary.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: No, no one has come
forth in support of this bill. I am not going
to heap more coals of condemnation on it.
Honourable senators must have been impressed with the fact that not only has it
received, apart from the honourable senator
who introduced it, no support from anyone,
but it has not even been damned with faint
praise. All speakers wholeheartedly condemned it. That is a most unusual situation.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: I would not say that
that is so. They mentioned certain things
in the bill which they did not like, but mostly
they talked about the old act.

ever sat has refused to hear anyone who
wanted to come forward and express his
views.
I feel that in this case it is more important
than ever we should hear these representations. Why do I say that? It is because upon
reading the reports of the committee meetings
held in the other house I see that no one was
permitted to present his or her views in
person. It is true the representations which
had been put in writing were distributed
amongst the members, but they were not
included in the committee's reports.
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): Some
were read into the record.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I think the honourable
senator from Ottawa West (Hon. Mr. Connolly)
will agree with me that very few were read
into the record, and this was only done after
a persistent demand by a member of the
committee.
Honourable senators, that is not good
enough for Senate committees. I hope that
when the committee does meet it will agree
to hear representations from all who want to
come forward and express their views. This
is an extremely important bill and should
receive our very careful consideration. In
conclusion I again wish to congratulate the
honourable senator who introduced the bill
(Hon. Mr. Thorvaldson) and all those who
have taken part in this very worth-while
debate.
Hon. W. D. Euler: Honourable senators,
this debate has been very refreshing, so far
as I am concerned. Those of you who have
been in this chamber for a good many years
know that I have advanced on more than
one occasion the theory or idea that when
a man or woman enters this chamber be or
she should forget party affiliations to a great
extent and that all questions should be decided here pretty much on their merits alone.
It is for this reason that I say the debate has
been a most refreshing one. We have heard
supporters of the Government being just as
free in their criticism of the bill as those on
this side. Up to now the debate has been
carried on entirely by members of the legal
profession, but I understand that my good
friend from Wellington (Hon. Mr. Howard),
who like myself is not a lawyer-

Hon. Mr. Macdonald: When the discussion
was through they had left very little for the
promoters to rejoice about. I repeat that
almost everyone seems to be wholeheartedly
against the bill. For my part I shall not take
up the cudgels on behalf of the introducer,
nor am I going to attempt to support the
bill. No doubt it contains some good features
and, without doubt, some very bad features.
One thing I like about this debate is that
honourable senators have now given notice
of the objections-and there are many-to
the bill. One honourable senator bas particularized the amendments which he proposes
to put forward when the bill gets into committee. Others have set forth clearly their
objections. So we know what we are going
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): He

As to the procedure in committee, I think

possible and we should hear representations some comments. I have an advantage over
there from all organizations and individuals him in that I am the first layman to speak

is traditional with Senate committees. I do discuss the bill itself but merely to make one
not believe that any Senate committee which or two suggestions. I think everyone will

AUGUST 14, 1958
agree with me that succession duties are entirely too high. As the honourable gentleman
from Grandville (Hon. Mr. Bouffard) has said,
in many respects they have been confiscatory
and have had a great deal to do with suppressing the enterprise of ordinary persons.
They feel that what they accumulate will
very largely go to the Government.
I was impressed and surprised by the fact
that the average annual revenues from succession duties in the past five or six years
have been just about $38 million, barring
those two years when the big estates were
distributed. Now, $38 million is a rather respectable sumHon. Mr. Bruni: Be careful. That is quite
a sum.
Hon. Mr. Euler: I say that it is a
respectable sum, but it is a relatively small
one when you think of the $4 billion or $5
billion spent every year; in fact, when you
consider all the difficulties and objections to
them, it is hardly necessary to have these
succession duty revenues at all. I have no
personal objective, in this matter but I think
it would be well to wipe out succession
duties entirely, because the revenues are
small, considering the difficulties of raising
them.
From the proposals that have been made
today I gather it is felt that there should
be public hearings. I agree wit hthis. The
objections to the bill are so many and varied
that I do not see how it is possible to get
the bill through this session if it is going to
close within any reasonable period. I think
the bill is so important that public hearings
should be held, at which anyone who desires
to do so may express his or her views, so
that a new bill may be prepared that will
remedy not only the defects of the bill before
us but also the defects of the present act.
Those are the thoughts I wanted to express
now: first, that I think this legislation is
hardly worth while, because of the proportionately small amount of revenues collected;
and secondly, that if we must have the
legislation, it should make the right kind of
provisions-and we cannot put such legislation through this session.
Hon. Charles B. Howard: Honourable senators, I had intended to make some extended
remarks on this bill but, as I am entirely
in favour of its going to committee as soon
as possible I will be brief so that the sponsor
may be able to close the debate tonight.
This is the most important bill I have
heard debated by either the House of Commons or the Senate in my 34 years in Parliament. It is generally realized to what extent
this legislation affects the people of Canada.
Most think it affects only a few, but it has

a tremendous impact on all Canadians. If
it goes through in its present form it will
do more to hold back our country than any
single piece of legislation I have seen put on
our statute books. Like my honourable friend
from Waterloo (Hon. Mr. Euler) I believe that
we should go into the matter properly and
hold the bill over for another year. It has
been stated that the legislation would not
go into effect anyway until January 1,
1959. We will have a session next year, and
if the Senate takes over the job of making
this bill into a good piece of legislation,
following out the suggestions that have been
made by those who have spoken to the bill
today, we won't be doing anybody any harm.
I was much impressed by the remarks of
the honourable senators from HastingsFrontenac (Hon. Mr. White), Hanover (Hon.
Mr. Brunt), Grandville (Hon. Mr. Bouffard) and
Toronto (Hon. Mr. Hayden). I agree with
everything they said, and my only hope is
that when the bill gets to committee it will
be held over until another session so that we
can deal with it properly. Possibly we can
get an Estate Tax Act that will displace the
present Succession Duties Act and render a
better service to all Canadians.
Hon. John T. Haig: Honourable senators,
I want to say a word or two on this matter.
I was amazed at the remarks of the honourable Leader of the Opposition (Hon. Mr.
Macdonald), who bas been here for a good
many years now. He said be was surprised
to find some opposition on the Government
side to a Government bill. Well, he will see
more of that before he is through, for some
of us over here would like to have our own
opinion and if we don't agree with what the
Government is doing we want to say so.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Good for you.
Hon. Mr. Haig: However, my point is this:
I have served in this bouse for 23 years,
I served in the Manitoba Legislature for
16 years before coming here, and I have
never yet seen anyone come before a committee to speak in favour of a bill the purpose of which is to put a tax on somebody.
You can hold all the meetings you like from
now until next January, and I venture to
say that you will not get anybody to come
and advocate the taxing of estates. Of course,
you may find some queer fellow who is in
favour of it, but that is all. It may be that
an exemption of $50,000 is not very much
to a man in Montreal, Toronto, Hanover, or
places like that, but I am from a part of the
world where an exemption of that kind is
pretty big, and where $50,000 is considered
quite an estate. A very few have left estates
bigger than that, and when they did their
names were published in the newspapers,
along with a story of what they did and how
they got their money.

SENATE
The great difficulty with calling officials
of Government under any party to give
information to a committee is that they seem
to be set apart to protect the state and do
not realize that the ordinary men and women
who have to pay taxes are citizens who want
to pay their debts and are seeking consideration. It may be that such citizens don't quite
understand the tax or their liability and they
raise an objection.
In our province of Manitoba-and I think
this applies in Saskatchewan as well when
a man dies the wife can take a third of
the estate without touching the will at all.
The will does not bind the wife, she can
take that third by right.
It bas been said that the Minister stated
the purpose of the bill was to reduce the
succession duty tax by about 10 per cent.
My honourable friend said it amounted to
only $39 million. No doubt he recalls that
some of the provinces pay taxes the one
to the other, as in the case of Ontario and
Quebec. In Manitoba we pay taxes to
Ontario from estates in Manitoba. For
instance, if you own stock in Ventures
Limited, or such a company, you have to
pay taxes on that stock in Ontario, and
they are exempted in Manitoba.
The Government claims that it is trying
to reduce the tax 10 per cent. If it can
be shown that they are not doing so, that
part of the bill can be criticized. But no one
has shown me yet that the reduction is
not correct.
On the question raised by the honourable
member from Toronto (Hon. Mr. Hayden),
I feel very strongly. I like legislation that
states clearly what the law is, so that the
man who runs may read. I do not object
to the bill; in fact, I think it is an improvement over the present act, because it seeks
a reduction in tax of 10 per cent. Whether
the tax could be reduced further or not I
do not know, but at least it is a step in the
right direction.
I can see no good purpose for sending
the bill to committee if we are likely to take
six months to deal with it. I think the
Leader of the Government (Hon. Mr. Aseltine) should consult with the Minister of
Finance and tell him that there is a feeling
among some of the members of the Senate
that this bill should be further considered
by the Senate, as was done in the case of
the Income Tax Act, and that we would
like until next January, or perhaps March,
to consider the whole matter, and to draft
a bill in such a way that all will understand
it and the people will be in favour of it.
If anyone wants to make that suggestion, I
am all for it, but I do not believe any
purpose would be served by sending the bill
to committee for a two- or three-day discus-

sion. We would never reach agreement. The
honourable members from Hanover (Hon.
Mr. Brunt) and Toronto (Hon. Mr. Hayden)
put forward suggestions that would take a
great deal of drafting by good lawyers. I
am not saying there are not good lawyers
in this house-there may be, but I am not in
that class. Even good lawyers would have
trouble redrafting this bill, but that is the
way it ought to be done.
I feel bound to say, however, that having
listened to the criticisms of the bill, I still
feel that it was drafted with good will and
in an attempt to reduce the taxes ten per
cent. It seems to me that it is my duty as
a senator from Manitoba to try to reduce
taxes every place I go. This is a start in
the right direction, and I am in favour of
the idea. I will go further and say, rather
than to be misunderstood, that I think the
Senate can perform a duty here that no other
branch of Parliament can perform. We can
help the Government of the day by drafting
legislation that is clear to the public, that
will do what it proposes to do, and that will
not lead to lawsuits and misunderstandings
later on. The men and women of this house
who were engaged in drafting the legislation
of the Income Tax Act will remember that
in committee we spent weeks and weeks at
the task, and the Government of the day
finally adopted the bill, which is now still
the law of the land and works very well.
Honourable senators, I am convinced that
if this bill goes to committee it will end in
a deadlock. If a delegation attended the
meetings we would be listening to them for
I understand that it is hoped to
weeks.
prorogue Parliament by the end of August.
I do not care if Parliament continues longer
than that, but I am sure there would not be
sufficient time to discuss this bill thoroughly
in committee. I think we should try to contribute the one thing that the Senate is
specially capable of doing better than anybody else, and I say that without conceit or
boasting. We have the facilities, the personnel
and the time. We have no political battles
to fight, because that is all over. Al that it
is necessary for us to do is to sit down and
take time to listen to the people who want
to make representations, and then draft the
legislation, consider it as if we were a court
of law, and make it say exactly what it
means. Then I believe it will be accepted by
the people of this country.
Hon. Mr. Euler: May I ask the honourable
member a question? He says how it should
be done. Does he want the work to be done
by a special committee? He bas already
said be does not want it referred to a standing committee.

AUGUST 14, 1958
Hon. Mr. Haig: It could be done by a
standing committee. However, it might be
most inconvenient for some members to
come.
I would prefer that preliminary
meetings be held to get the organization
under way this fall; that could be done
before we leave Ottawa for our homes. Then
we could meet in January. The honourable
senators from Toronto (Hon. Mr. Hayden),
Hanover (Hon. Mr. Brunt), and HastingsFrontenac (Hon. Mr. White) have made
statements and recommendations
which
could be prepared for drafting, and then
we could tell the Government what we want.
We could hear delegations when we meet in
January, or whenever the new session
begins, and then have the draft ready. That
is what I would prefer to do.
I would
send it to any committee you like, even to a
special committee, depending on what the
house wishes. We did it before. At one
time we had a special committee on which
50 senators were members. I would be in
favour of such a committee in this instance.
What I want to do is to get 50 members of
this house into an organization that will
hear delegations, that will consider the
legislation, and will then decide if the bill
does what it is supposed to do. I don't say
that the committee will adopt the legislation.
But whatever they decide upon can be submitted to Parliament.
Hon. Norman P. Lamberi: Honourable senators, I want to say one or two words by
way of appreciation of the offerings that
have been made in this debate. Personally
I am under a debt of gratitude to those who
have spoken, such as the honourable senator
from Grandville (Hon. Mr. Bouffard) the
honourable senator from Toronto (Hon. Mr.
Hayden), and the honourable senator from
Hanover (Hon. Mr. Brunt). What has been
said has certainly clarified my mind with
respect to this legislation.
My honourable friend from Winnipeg
(Hon. Mr. Haig) well remembers the work
that was done on a piece of legislation that
may be regarded as comparable to this. That
was in connection with the change of the
income tax law from the Income War Tax
Act to the present Income Tax Act. Now,
honourable senators, if as much work had
been done on this measure before it was
submitted to Parliament at all as was done
on the Income Tax Act by the special committee appointed by the Senate prior to 1949,
I think we would have a very much clearer
idea of the rather complicated provisions
of this bill.
I would suggest, if I am in order, that in
view of the lack of urgency in bringing the
legislation into effect at the present time,

sufficient time should be taken for full study
of this matter by the Senate through the
operation of a special committee, if necessary, if that should be considered more
suitable for the purpose than the Banking
and Commerce Committee.
Hon. Mr. Euler: You mean a special committee?
Hon. Mr. Lambert: Yes. Then we could
have a job done on it comparable to the
one that was done in connection with the
revision of the Income Tax Act prior to 1949.
If that were done I am quite satisfied we
would not only render a worth-while service
to the people of Canada as a whole, but we
would certainly be fulfilling the function for
which this chamber exists.
Now, in the other house, with all due
respect to the debate there, its committe did
not begin to deal with this legislation in a
way that was comparable to any of the discussion that was contributed here this afternoon and evening. For that reason I certainly
would like to see this bill held over for a
while. Let it go to the Standing Committee
on Banking and Commerce on Monday, if
necessary, and watch developments.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Don't you think we had
better let that committee decide what to do,
rather than tell it now what to do?
Hon. Mr. Lambert: I am not attempting to
instruct the committe at all; I am just suggesting the line that might be followed in
order that we and the public might make
a more thoroughgoing examination of the
purpose of the bill.
Hon. W. M. Aseltine: Honourable senators,
I have always been very much interested in
succession duty matters because we have a
great deal of work to do in that connection
in the province I come from. When the House
of Commons introduced the draft bill last
January, gave it first reading and then sent
copies of it all across Canada, I took several
copies home to Saskatchewan, distributed
them and had meetings with lawyers and
others with respect to the same. They were
all of the opinion-not only lawyers, but
laymen and others who came in to ask questions about the bill-that this was a great
improvement over the present act. They
liked the increase in the exemption in cases
where there was a widow and where there
were surviving children.
It has been said here today that if the
testator did not leave his widow and children
anything, there would be no duty at all if
the estate went to somebody else. I would
like to point out that in the province of
Saskatchewan, and in most of the other provinces I know of, there is legislation to the

SENATE

effect that no person can make a will leaving
his widow less than she would get if he did
not have a will. Under the law in force in
the province of Saskatchewan in this respect,
a widow can make application to the courts
within six months or so of the death of her
husband, and the courts have power to allow
her the whole estate if they think it is
required to keep her and the children. They
do that quite frequently.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: That is, if she is
a dependent widow. What if she has means
of her own?
Hon. Mr. Aselline: That is taken into
consideration.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Not at all. Under
this bill, if she has means of her own the
husband can leave his estate as he wishes.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: I mean to say that what
property she has is taken into consideration,
but in the case where a widow is left without
much property she can make an application to the courts and possibly get the whole
estate.
Honourable senators, I think the proper
thing to do is to have the bill referred to
the Standing Committee on Banking and
Commerce for consideration, and it will
be up to the committee to decide whether it
will hear those who are in favour of the bill
and those who are opposed to it. I myself
think this is a good bill and a big improvement on the present act.
Much ef the debate this afternoon and
evening has been with respect to the deficiencies in the bill. I do not say that this
bill or the present act, or any other succession duty law, is perfect. I might like
to see things changed considerably, but I
do not think that we should say that just
because this bill is not satisfactory to everybody we should not deal with it and pass it,
if Parliament thinks it should be passed.
I would like to see the bill referred to the
Standing Committee on Banking and Commerce, where we could hear a statement from
the minister.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: The committee bas to
decide that, as you just stated a moment ago.
Hon. Mr. AselIine: Yes. If the committee
agrees, I would like to hear a statement from
the minister and also what some of these
other people have to say.
The debate today has been a good one.
I appreciate the fact that we have had some
fine addresses, and features have been pointed
out that should be considered carefully and
weighed. I do not know just what power
the Senate has to make amendments to bills
concerning taxation such as this, but that
can all be threshed out at the proper time.

So I think that when the debate on second
reading is concluded the bill should be
referred to the Standing Committee on Banking and Commerce for consideration.
Hon.

J.

Wesley

Siambaugh: Honourable

senators, perhaps the house should hear from
another layman. I am not interested in this
bill from a lawyer's point of view, but rather
from the angle of an executor, in which
capacity I have served on several occasions.
My main purpose in rising at this time
is to compliment all honourable senators
who have discussed this bill. It has been the
most reasonable and most informative debate
I listened to from both sides of the chamber
since I came to this house. I believe if the
members of the Banking and Commerce
Committee show the same reasonableness as
bas been shown in the debate in the chamber,
no difficulty will be encountered in arriving
at a satisfactory solution to the problems.
As a layman, I compliment ail those who
have taken part in this most informative
debate.

Hon. Gunnar S. Thorvaldson: Honourable
senators,The Hon.

the

Acting Speaker

(Hon. Mr.

Choquette): Honourable senators, if the honourable senator who moved second reading
of this bill speaks now, he will close the
debate.
Hon. Mr. Thorvaldson: In closing the debate I shall keep the house for only a few
minutes, for the purpose of making one or
two cursory remarks.
First, may I thank honourable senators
most sincerely for the very kind references
they have made to the manner in which this
bill was introduced in the Senate. I know
they do so because of their very great generosity to a new member of the Senate. But
despite that, I heartily thank them for their
courtesy to me in my performance of this
task. Honourable senators, as the session
draws near to a close may I say this courtesy
to which I refer is in conformity with every
action of the older senators towards the
newer members of this house. That is one of
the characteristics of this chamber which
makes life here very pleasant for a new
senator.
With respect to the bill, may I say that it
has been under consideration by the Department of Finance since about 1954. Although
the bill is Government legislation, it apparently was under consideration before the
change of administration in 1957.
With respect to the very able and capable
debate which has taken place on this bill in
this house, may I say that I do not believe
the main principles behind the measure have

HOUSING
REPORT OF FINANCE COMMITTEE-MOTION
FOR ADOPTION-DEBATE ADJOURNED

The Senate proceeded to consideration of
the report of the Standing Committee on
Finance on the report of the Central Mortgage
and Housing Corporation for the fiscal year
ended December 31, 1957.
Hon. R. B. Horner moved that the report
be adopted.
He said: Honourable senators, as ViceChairman of the Standing Committee on
Finance, it falls to my lot to perform a somewhat unusual duty. On the evening before
he passed away, the late Senator Hawkins,
Chairman of the committee, prepared in writing the remarks he intended to make in the
house when moving concurrence in the committee's report. His roorn-mate passed them
along to me, and I think it would be the wish
of honourable senators that I simply read the
same. Honourable senators will have no doubt
at all as to who prepared the remarks for
in them is reflected a plain picture of our
late colleague.
In asking you to concur in this report I do so
with considerable confidence. Since the war there
has been a tremendous advance made in providing
housing for our people. The report of the Central
Mortgage and Housing Corporation, which bas been
under review by your committee, gives us a pretty
clear indication of the achievement in the housing
field in recent years.

The corporation, I think, has made a most
valuable contribution in its effort to provide not
only houses and homes but bouses which are
structurally sound, whose facilities are adequate
for comfortable living and capable of serving for
the maximum length of time, with proper care
and attention from their owners.
One of the other accomplishments of the corporation is that they pretty well assure the buyer
that he is getting what he pays for. Sometimes
I do not think the contribution they are making
in this field is fully appreciated. Of course, the
main responsibility assigned to the organization
was the arranging for mortgage money for home
building at reasonable rates of interest and for
longer terms than is usual practice. I am sure
you will agree that their success in this phase of
their endeavours has been commendable.
There is a concept of government with which
I most heartily agree and it is that, after the
maintenance of law and order, their next responsibility should be the creation of conditions
wherein each citizen would have an opportunity
to help himself, improve his own position and
a

better demonstration of the principle I have just
mentioned than the achievements of the Central

owner who bas secured a house under the guidance
and facilities of the corporation can not only
enjoy the satisfaction of owning his own home,
but the almost greater satisfaction of knowing he
bas paid for it himself-or is paying for itwithout any handout from the taxpayers of this
country.
Now, I would like to refer to the subject of
The economic health of a
home ownership.
country is measured by its housing, but I will
not digress today to discuss the economic aspect
of housing. However, I would earnestly draw the
attention of honourable members to the benefits
which can and do accrue to this country by
virtue of a large number of home owners. Many
of us will recall with happy memories our early
days in our old homes, and I am sure that almost
all honourable members will agree that, in this
atmosphere in which we were brought up, the
sense of stability and of belonging to the community has granted us a benefit which bas been
with us most of our lives.
It is a matter of pride to me as a Canadian to
learn that almost two-thirds of the housing units
of this country are occupied by their owners.
While this is a good thing for the country as a
whole, in my opinion it is particularly good for
the home owners themselves. The circumstances
and state of mind of our citizens is a matter of
concern to all who are dealing with the affairs of
Any Government, regardless of
this country.
its political hue, cannot fail to derive advantages
if this high proportion of home ownership continues.
What are these benefits that I speak of? First, I
would suggest that an added sense of responsibility is given to a man who acquires a home of
his own. This pride of ownership, this knowledge
that he bas a stake in his own country, must of
necessity give a sense of belonging to the community in which be lives. The very fact that
he is the owner of a piece of property, however
small, is enough to make an owner more conscious
of civic affairs and more alive to the needs of the
district in which he resides. With the acquisition

of a house comes a greater resourcefulness.
normal man of modest means is going to pay for
things he can do himself. This sense of resourcefulness and creation is a great character builder.
However modest a home may be, it can always

AUGUST 15, 1958
be improved, and there is no greater satisfaction
than having done it with one's own hands. This
applies not only to the dwelling but to its surroundings, its garden and its part of the immediate
neighbourhood.
More than any of these things is the influence
on the children who are brought up in a home
of their own. No family can feel as stable as the
family which is living in a house of its own.
From early childhood, through adolescence, on to
adulthood, the young human being can develop
its sense of belonging to the neighbourhood,
being one of a group of people who, by their
own efforts, are part owners of the community.
The natural development of a child is imperative
to good citizenship.
This development, while It
can certainly take place within an apartment
dwelling, is, nevertheless, under such circumstances,
more restricted than to a child who, when he says
he is going home, can really mean that he is in
fact going to his own home and not to some
rented dwelling, from which he will be removed
every few years.
As we all know, this is a young and spirited
country, and it is good that our young are content
to travel to where the opportunities are best.
Nevertheless, a stable population is also necessary
for the natural development of the country. Houses,
like good wine, improve with age, if they are
looked after. I would suggest that people themselves improve after a period of living in homes
of their own.
They are proud of their homes,
they are proud of the development of the children
as part of the community, and, as I have said,
there is a much greater consciousness of civic
affairs, of religion, and the many activities originating in a well-established and stable community.
I realize, of course, there are many people who
will never own their own homes. I also realize that
it will always be necessary to provide rental
accommodation.
I would suggest, however, that
the main resources of our housing legislation,
whether it be federal or provincial, should be
directed to assist, or maybe I should say provide,
opportunities to citizens to own homes of their
own. We live in a free-enterprise system. Such
a system can only thrive if its citizens are
resourceful, imaginative and self-reliant, and I
would suggest that there is no better method of
increasing these attributes of our citizens than
assuring that there are adequate facilities for them
to acquire homes of their own.
Prom the national point of view it is obvious
that such people will be better workers, better
employers and better all-round citizens, from the
standpoint of developing communities in which
they and their neighbours live happily and
harmoniously, and thus contribute ta the building
of a nation which could well be a model of selfreliance, stability and good living.
You will notice that I have in this talk avoided
any definite reference to the economic value
to the individual citizen of home ownership, but
I should like to direct your attention to the
fact that the stabilizing influence of home ownership tends to strengthen the economic position
of a nation.
And now, ta conclude, I wish on behalf of the
committee ta express our appreciation and thanks
to the many persons who appeared before us.
Almost without exception, their contributions indicated their earnest desire to add to the information of the committee and also to have a part
in assisting the corporation and all concerned with
it ta make an even greater contribution to better
housing. Also, to the staff of the Committees
Branch, a well merited thanks for their excellent
co-operation during the hearings of the committee.

pf

Honourable senators, that completes the
readings of the text prepared by the late
Senator Hawkins. In the normal course of
events I perhaps should have something to
say about the report. Suffice it to say, I
entirely agree with it.
Perhaps it is an opportune moment to add
a few words of appreciation to the Central
Mortgage and Housing Corporation and in
particular to Mr. Stewart Bates, its President,
for the very valuable information he gave
the committee. I have in my hand a press
clipping from this morning's Globe and Mail
concerning the increase in house-building
permits of this June over last June. It reads:
Value of building permits issued by Canadian
municipalities were 36.7 per cent greater in June
at $235,000,000 compared with $172,000,000 in June
last year, the Dominion Bureau of Statistics reports.

Of course that is all to the good, because
many trades are helped by the house-building
program.
Hon. Donald Smith (Queens-Shelburne):
Honourable senators, it was indeed a fine
tribute to our late beloved colleague, Senator Hawkins, that the honourable senator
from Blaine Lake (Hon. Mr. Horner) saw fit
to read to us what were, in all probability,
the last written words of one of the wisest
of us all. This was not a difficult choice, I
am sure, for the honourable senator from
Blaine Lake, because no doubt he has found
ready acceptance of the philosophy so well
expressed.
It seems to me as though the late Senator
Hawkins may have had a premonition of
the shortness of time that was to be his, and
in that short time he called upon his many
years of experience and reflection to produce
this most valuable exhortation to us all to
realize more fully the meaning and value of
a home, not only to the individual, but to
the community and the nation. I hope that
his words of truth and wisdom will be read
by many of our fellow Canadians, so that
they may reflect on and consider their
individual attitudes regarding the real values
of home ownership.
Honourable senators, at the outset of my
remarks I wish to say that the members of
the Finance Committee, after having examined thoroughly the operations of the
Central Mortgage and Housing Corporation,
could have nothing but the highest compliments for Mr. Bates, the President of the
corporation, and his officials and employees.
All of us are in agreement with the report
in this connection. During the examination
of the subject the committee was greatly
assisted, indeed, by representatives of
organizations outside the Government service, and we are grateful for their help. For

SENATE
the information of those who are not members of this committee, and so that they may
realize the scope of the examination, the
names of these organizations should be
recorded. They are: Canadian Construction
Association, The National House Builders
Association, Community Planning Association, Dominion Mortgage and Investment
Association, Canadian Bankers Association,
National Conference of Canadian Universities,
and Canadian Federation of Mayors and
Municipalities.
In beginning my remarks on the housing
problem which faces the Canadian people
today, I can do no better than to quote what
was said by Mr. Bates, as recorded at page
224 of the Proceedings of the Standing
Committee on Finance:
I know that we have almost 4 million houses
in Canada and that we have 6 million children at
school. It will not be too long before they are
going to marry and they will require at least
3 million homes. I don't know how you gentlemen
felt in the twenties or thirties, but the fact is
that the housing stock in Canada must almost
double in the next 15 to 20 years. This you must
accept. Whether it will be Toronto that will grow
to that extent or whether there should be three
new cities of a million population each, I don't
know. That is not my problem.
I believe the
most important consideration confronting Canadians
is that we have 6 million children at school, and
3 million families to be housed in the future.
We are educating them now. There is a housing
stock of 4 million, of which a very large percentage
is over 50 years of age. Some are decrepit and
rat-infested, and on top of this we have 3 million
new families that will have to be housed very soon.
As I have said, this is the essence of the national
problem.

I only wish that I could quote these words
in the dramatic and forceful manner in which
they were delivered, and with such effect, by
Mr. Bates. This statement seemed to
straighten out the thinking of the committee
in so far as the dimension of the housing
problem is concerned. It is clear, then, that
if housing is to be made available at least for
these 3 million new family formations, houses
must be constructed at an average rate of
150,000 per year. This figure is the expected
rate for 1958, which is the highest, by a
large margin, in Canadian history. To state
the complete problem we must also consider
the question of the supply of houses for
immigrants, of whom there have been 1l
million since the war. We must have a place
in our calculations for the necessary replacement of losses by fire and deterioration. We
must consider slum clearance, urban redevelopment as well as replacement of houses
which have to be torn down for new arterial
highway construction. I think it will be
readily agreed that the rate of 150,000 new
homes per annum is really a minimum one
and that the whole problem is not one to
prepare for in the future, it is before us now.

Since the war there has been a gradually
increasing influence of national housing legislation on the growth of the house-building

industry. During that period almost half of
all new housing has been built with some
form of federal participation, and in general
all this has been done without cost to the
taxpayers. It is evident that during these
post-war years the development of the very
many phases of the nation's housing legislation and its implementation have been carried
out in an excellent and far-sighted manner by
the former minister and his advisers. It was
indeed gratifying to me, as it was to many
others who were his former colleagues, to
read in the record of Parliament the high
compliment paid to the Honourable Robert
Winters by his successor in office-and a
very worthy one-the present Minister of
Public Works.
As well as having a vital role in the social
structure of Canadian life-as was so well

pointed out by the late Chairman of the
committee-the house-building industry bas
a tremendous part to play in the Canadian
economy. We are inclined to think-and
rightly so-of the automobile industry as
being of first-rate importance in our economy,
but it must take an inferior position when
compared with the housing industry. Figures
which have been recently published show
that the highest annual production of the
automobile industry in Canada, which was
in 1956, had a value of $838 million. In comparison it is estimated that in this year of
1958 the value of the residential construction
in Canada will be of the order of $la billion, or more than twice the value of the
production from the automobile industry. To
this $l billion worth of residential construction a large figure must, of course, be added
for the cost of new electrical equipment,
furnishings, et cetera, which are going into
these new houses and the average expenditure on which has been estimated, as a result
of answers to recent questionnaires, to be in
the vicinity of $1,500 per housing unit. This
makes an addition of another $1 billion, a
total value for 1958 of $2 billion for new
residential construction and furnishings.
To continue to meet the minimum objective
of 150,000 houses per annum and, eventually,
to increase this rate, three immediate problems must be solved: There must be: (1)
more lower-cost housing, (2) adequate supply
of serviced land, (3) a steady and sufficient
flow of mortgage money. All these problems
are closely related and more or less
interdependent.
May I refer first to the problem of the
provision of more lower-cost houses. When
it is pointed out that the average annual
income of N.H.A. borrowers is $5,700, it is

AUGUST 15, 1958
obvious that the benefits of housing legislation are not reaching into the lower onethird group of wage-earning and salaried
Canadians. There is therefore a great need
of a lower-cost type of house, acceptable in
construction by municipal standards, and acceptable as well to those in the lower income
group.
The National House Builders Association
has already designed a low-cost type of bouse
which meets these requirements and on which
Central Mortgage and Housing Corporation
will approve loans. A model of this bouse
bas been built at a total cost of $8,000, including land, on which the down payment would
be $800. The total monthly payments would
be $60 and the income requirements of applicants for such a loan would be $2,700
a year or $52 a week. For interesting details
of the plans and specifications of this low-cost
type of bouse, may I refer you to the February
issue of The National Builder, a publication
of the National House Builders Association.
An adaptation of this particular house bas
already been built in the Halifax area and
has attracted a great deal of attention. Such
bouses can only be built within an $8,000
limit when there is reasonably priced serviced
land. Where the lot is more than $500 the
cost goes up accordingly. Low-cost housing
is simply not feasible on high-cost land.
There is also a demand for an even more
modest type of bouse in remote or rural
areas, a house that would be priced in the
$5,000 range and which would also qualify
for N.H.A. loans. The members of the committee were glad to learn that architects of
C.M.H.C. are presently working on the plans
and specifications for such a bouse. It would
be a stripped-down bouse, built without
specialties. It could be designed, for instance,
with bedrooms directly off the living space,
doing away with halls or corridors. It could
contain plain kitchen, shelves, not fancy
modern cabinets. There could be a simpler
substitute for clothes closets. It could contain softwood floors-not birch or expensive oak. There could be provisions for
"do-it-yourself" in connection with storm
windows and screens. There could be one
or more unfinished bedrooms, lending further
opportunity for "do-it-yourself" which seems
so popular and even essential these days.
In other words, this type of bouse could
take the form of an improved summer cottage. We understand that the plans and
specifications will soon be published and
be available for those living in areas in which
such a house would be suitable, and we have
been told that C.M.H.C. will lend directly or
approve loans on it. I believe this will fill
quite a gap in areas in the part of the country
from which I come.
57075-4-37

Before leaving the subject of low-cost bousing I should like to make brief mention of
the unique co-operative housing plan in my
province of Nova Scotia, under which many
low-cost houses have been built. This plan
operates under section 36 of the N.H.A., assisted by the services of the Nova Scotia
Housing Commission, the only organization
of its kind that I know of. This scheme is
the latest manifestation of that pioneering
spirit of co-operation that built the first homes
by the sea and elsewhere and manned the
fishing vessels, and which to this modern day
is still carried on in the system of sharing
in the catch. It is regrettable that there are
not more general manifestations of this spirit
of working and sharing together, not only in
this country, but in the entire world.
I would like to say a few words on the
second problem, that of having an adequate
supply of serviced land at reasonable costs,
which must be found, in order to make it
possible to have more low-cost housing.
The committee was informed that the average cost of a serviced lot, which was $500 in
1947, rose to $1,600 in 1954 and then to $2,500
in 1957. Since this average figure includes
the lower cost in many small towns, it is
evident that in most metropolitan areas the
average cost of lots at the present time is
well in excess of $2,500. A typical case in
a metropolitan area was brought to the committee's attention where the cost of the serviced lot was $3,600. The details of the breakdown of this cost were contained in the brief
presented to the committee by the Toronto
Metropolitan House Builders Association. I
can summarize the breakdown by stating that
in round figures the raw land costs $1,100;
roads, curbs, sidewalks, sewer and water connection $1,900; municipal fees and contributions, plus overhead and miscellaneous costs
amounted to over $600. In other words,
whereas the land itself cost less than onethird of the total, the cost of the municipal
services to the home owner was more than
one-half of the cost of the serviced lot. Some
few years ago the cost of these services was
paid for over a long period of years by means
of local improvement taxes, but now the
municipal bond debt is being replaced by the
mortgage debt of the homeowner. The municipalities now are either unwilling or unable
to assume the responsibility which bas always
been theirs. The unwillingness of all the
taxpayers of a metropolitan area to share the
long-term capital cost of the "big pipes"-as
they are often referred to--serving these
great housing developments may or may not
be a factor of importance. On the surface, it
does appear to me that, having regard to the
respective average incomes, municipal taxes
in some of these metropolitan areas are not

conditions without embarking on a longterm national plan to get rid of them must
pay a price far greater than the price in
dollars which may be involved.
In this connection you may be interested
to learn that of the 50 cities in Canada with
populations in excess of 25,000, only 14 have
taken advantage of the federal grants for
urban renewal studies. I am happy to note
that three of these 14 are the Maritime cities
of Halifax, Saint John and Moncton. It is
of real concern that there are only four cities
which at present are embarking on a program
of slum clearance. I am glad to report that
two of these four are the cities of St. John's,
Newfoundland, and Halifax, Nova Scotia. It
is certainly to be hoped that the program
of assistance available from C.M.H.C. with
respect to urban renewal and slum clearance
will soon be extended to many other centres
where the need is indeed great.
Now, I come to the third and last problem,
which I mentioned previously, and which is
a very important one, namely, the problem of
providing a steady and sufficient flow of
mortgage money.
It is well known that when the demand
for long-term money by governments and
private corporations is high, the supply of
mortgage money becomes tight. For example,
during the year 1957 the rate on National
Housing Act mortgages was not competitive,
and lending institutions used alternative
types of investments. N.H.A. mortgages
yielded six per cent, whereas conventional
mortgage loans yielded from 6a to 71 per
cent, and it was natural that the preference
should be given to those investments on
which the higher rate of return was available. On N.H.A. loans, legislation restricts
the interest rate to a ceiling composed of
the current yield on federal 20-year bonds,
plus 21 per cent. The rate on the new conversion loan bonds of long term being 4,
per cent, this ceiling during 1958 could be
42 per cent, plus 21 per cent which equals
6¾ per cent. Certainly if the yield on conventional loans and other investments continues to be higher as a result of the
conversion bond rate, N.H.A. mortgages will
not interest the lending agencies. The number
is rapidly growing of those who believe that
dominion - provincial - municipal conference it was unnecessary to give such a generous
with the serious intention of making an bargain to the holders of Victory Bonds, a
exhaustive study of all its aspects, and above very large proportion of which were in the
all to make definite decisions, the least of hands of financial institutions. It is felt by
which should be direct low-interest loans to many that a successful conversion could have
municipalities with provincial approval and been made at lower rates of interest, thus
participation. If municipalities cannot finance having the beneficial effect of holding the
"big pipes", how can they be expected to rid line in interest rates on N.H.A. loans as well
themselves of the slum sores which continue as for other purposes.
to ooze the infection of juvenile delinquency,
Since there are a great many demands for
crime and disease, of both body and mind? financing the development of Canada, of
Any nation which continues to tolerate such

at present equal in burden to those living in
smaller communities. I wonder also whether
the industries which are locating in these
metropolitan areas are assuming their full
share of municipal tax responsibility. This
is a phase of the problem which should b
examined more fully.
Be that as it may, evidence given to the
committee suggests that there are, however,
real difficulties involved in obtaining the required municipal financing through the usual
bond issues, and that the present tax and
financial structures are becoming increasingly
inadequate when mounting costs of education
and other necessary expenditures are taken
into consideration. This problem of an adequate supply of serviced land at a reasonable
cost to the home owner is of real importance
and has been referred to as the key to the
housing problem, and particularly to the problem of building low-cost houses.
I regret that the committee gave this
important subject such short treatment in
its report-I believe it occupied only one and
three-quarter lines in the report. This is a
big subject and something more should have
been said on it. The problem is not only a
local but a national one. When two-thirds
of all the houses built in Canada are being
built in the metropolitan areas-from Halifax
to Victoria-and when 30 per cent of the
metropolitan houses are being built in
Toronto, 25 per cent in Montreal, 15 per cent
in Vancouver, the problem of financing
serviced land certainly extends beyond metropolitan or provincial boundaries, from both
social and economic viewpoints. Although I
could suggest a happy alternative, having in
mind the many opportunities for better living in those provinces in the Atlantic area,
if the concentration of industrial development
must continue in what are already large
centres of population, then the problem which
that concentration creates must be met.
We are informed that a federal-municipal
conference is to be held in the fall of this
year, but it appears that this will be a
courtesy conference only, since it has been
stated that no decisions will be made. The
solution of the problem I have discussed,
it seems to me, requires the calling of a

AUGUST 15, 1958
which housing is but one, this should be a
time for restraint and careful planning by
the Government as well as the people of
Canada. There can be no increase in the
number of jobs to provide employment for
the six million young Canadians now starting to flow into the labour stream-and
thereby in the circumstances of being potential home owners-without substantial resource and industrial development. This
necessary development will require immense
supplies of capital funds. Neither can employment opportunities be maintained without
a continually healthy economy. To me, this
means that we must continue to increase our
level of trade, which can only be brought
about by gradual freer trade policies. To
continue and expand world trade, prices must
be competitive, and this cannot be done if
the printing presses roll on recklessly to keep
political promises, thereby bringing on a
bigger dose of inflation and high prices.
Adequate supplies of mortgage money for
housing and these other important purposes
cannot be made available if we must find
the money to make some of these "visions"
we heard about become a reality immediately. For instance, I am sure the Canadian people, at this time, prefer that adequate
financial resources be made available for
houses, slum clearance and urban re-development, rather than for the construction of
transportation facilities to new mineral resources at a time when there is no market
for the production from mines already developed. I have in mind particularly those
mines in the Bathurst area of New Brunswick
where production of base metal ore has
stopped, and for which a railroad was recently built, but where no train now operates.
There is serious doubt, as well, that this is
the time to use much-needed financial resources for the enlargement of the productive
acreage in the west, in view of continuing
marketing difficulties.
To the end that the orderly and constant
development of Canada may proceed on all
fronts, it seems to me that a special inquiry
should be made on the subject of availability
and best use of financial resources. The
means to accomplish a fair regional distribution of capital requirements should also be
explored.
If a thorough examination of
this subject were made by an independent
body, serious mistakes might be avoided by
both private enterprise and government,
mistakes for which the Canadian people in
the future would pay a high price. This
may well be an appropriate subject of
inquiry for the Senate Committee on Finance,
and it certainly is an important one.
In conclusion, may I express the hope that
what I have had to say on this important
57075-4-37j

matter of housing, with all its social and
economic implications, will serve to underUne some of the problems and stimulate my
more experienced and able colleagues in
this chamber to give serious consideration
to them.
Hon. William M. Wall: Honourable senators, I am sure we are indebted to the
honourable senator from Queens-Shelburne
(Hon. Mr. Smith) for his very able analysis
of three important problem areas in this
whole problem area of providing houses for
Canadian people-and by "bouses" I mean
housing in the wide sense.
I should like to make a few observations
concerning one specific item which perturbs
me a great deal. Although I am not a member of the Standing Committee on Finance
I hope that these few observations concerning the report we are now considering, and
whose main features I subscribe to, will be
accepted from one of my standing in this
bouse.
I should say, by way of introductory
explanation, that I attended all the meetings
of the committee and I did try to share in
the consideration and discussion of the many
problem areas which were unfolded-by
conscientious and competent and publicminded witnesses-as we considered the
report of Central Mortgage and Housing
Corporation.
The committee's
report is somewhat
unique and exemplary in its excellent
presentation of the main problem areas in
housing and these are indicated very clearly
in items 1 to 10. This group judgment on
the 10 problem areas considered is presented
with very commendable brevity and refreshing clarity. Although I am not in agreement
with some of the recommendations or some
of the omissions, one of which I wish
especially to speak of and object to, I do
feel that the report is a very good report
because it puts our joint index finger on
very important problem areas as we all in
Canada continue to wrestle with the continuing and changing problem of providing
housing for Canadians-old, middle aged,
just newly married and the young.
Honourable senators will understand why
I am being motivated to say that a very
large share of the credit for the excellence
of this report rests with the committee's
chairman, the late Senator Hawkins, that
hard-working and ever courtly gentleman
whose honest impartiality, whose organizational ability, whose sincere humaneness
and love of his fellowman made such an
impression upon me in the short space of
time in which it was my privilege and deep
honour to know him; and I know we were
all jointly moved by the directness and the

SENATE

clarity of the late senator's beliefs and basic
concepts of government and citizenship as
epitomized in this statement which was so
ably presented by the honourable senator
from Blaine Lake (Hon. Mr. Horner) this
afternoon.
As I think of the contribution which this
report is likely to have both upon public
opinion generally and, may I hope, of upon
our
some reformulation of some aspects
Government's housing policies specifically,
and as I think back to the vigorous and excelent analysis-nay, analyses-made by our
distinguished colleagues yesterday afternoon
and evening of the-what shall we call them
uncertainties, the still existing
-apparent
anomalies and unsolved injustices of the new
legislation concerning the taxation of estates
which, I agree, is better than the present
legislation but which is still not good enough
and which would have benefited much, honourable senators, by prior Senate study and
consideration, I am more than ever convinced
that this chamber has a singular and challenging contribution to make to the protection
and the safeguarding of the welfare of the
Canadian public by undertaking the study of
the consideration of, and the reporting on
other Governmental problem areas, one of
which was mentioned by the honourable
senator from Queens-Shelburne (Hon. Mr.
Smith); and my hope is, my desire is, my
prayer is that at the next regular session of
Parliament the Senate may make more such
investigations as this one on housing.
Now, the honourable senator from QueensShelburne very ably assessed the general
problem of providing for Canadians in the
next 15 or 20 years new homes at the rate
of 150,000 per annum and at an overall cost,
other things being equal, of about $2 billion
be
a year. And within that overall context
brilliantly described the problem, the gnawing problem, the problem that, it appears, has
never really hit us in the face hard enough,
and that is the problem of providing low-cost
housing for people who have not the money
to buy the kind of houses that are being
built at the present time. And item 5 of our
report is basically significant in its implications, for it points out just that very problem
in that general context of housing-how do
we provide a family with a relatively low
income a good functional house which the
husband and the wife can afford to purchase?
Exhibit 2 of the printed proceedings of the
committee, volume 9, at page 252, pinpoints
that problem rather dramatically, for it says
that people earning an income of under
$3,000 in 1954 had homes built under the
National Housing Act of not even one per
cent of all the houses built. In 1955 we did
better-we reached one per cent. But in 1956

we were down to less than one-half of one
per cent, and in 1958, if I extrapolate from
the non-agency and the agency loans for the
first quarter, we are doing about one-quarter
of one per cent.
And then the question can be still more
adequately pinpointed, honourable senators,
if you ask, "Well, how many people are
there in Canada who are earning $3,000 or
less?" And then the chickens, if I may be
brutal, come home to roost. For, according
to the latest available figures of income,
liquid assets and indebtedness of non-farm
families of Canada, 1955-and that is the
latest available data-43.9 per cent of all
families and unattached individuals earn
$2,999 or less per year. And for this 43 per
cent of our population, if you could be just in
saying it in that very way, we are providing
one per cent, one-half of one per cent or onequarter of one per cent of houses under the
National Housing Act. Here is one of the
crucial, the basic, problems that somehow we
have to face.
Putting it in another way: Questions were
asked during our committee proceedings as
to how many homes have been provided
in toto since we have started this imited
dividend plan for providing low-cost housing
for rental accommodation and so on. If
my memory serves me correctly, we were
given a figure of around 7,000 or 8,000. When
that is related back over four or five years and
compared with the total number of houses,
how woefully, pitifully small that number is.
Or, as was given to us in evidence-and I
checked it today-about one per cent of the
total housing was of this low-cost rental type
housing last year. Out of 120,000 units one
per cent is 1,200 units. What are 1,200 units
among so many people in Canada who earn
$3,000 a year or less. If the figure is further
related to the number of people who are
earning $4,000 or less, that problem becomes
desperately acute.
Therefore I personally welcome, as I am sure
all honourable senators do, the committee's
emphasis on the importance of home ownership for the low-income group, and its request
that the fullest possible resources-and I
stress those words-of Central Mortgage and
Housing Corporation be directed to solving
this problem. I say "Amen" to that.
Next I should like to deal with item 2
of the report, having to do with the problem
of mortgage insurance on existing residential
real estate. The problem arose as to whether
it would not, in fact, be a good thing somehow to change the National Housing Act so
that I, or anyone, could purchase an already
existing house at probably not as high a price
as that of the average new house. You
will notice that the committee felt, and

AUGUST 15, 1958
our statement in the report is, that an extension
of the National Housing Act does not appear
to be appropriate at the present time. But
we did not close the door altogether on that
issue.
Now, honourable senators, I fail to see why
the present time may not in fact be the
most suitable time, a time perhaps long
overdue. It would be my hope, in the interest
of accelerating and extending the present
existing opportunities for home ownership by
people with lower incomes, that a study of
this problem area by C.M.H.C. be expedited,
and that this sequential amendment involving
the extension of the National Housing Act
to allow the purchase of existing homes by
home-owner loans be finally recommended to
the Government for necessary legislative
action.
Hon. Mr. Bishop: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Wall: Now I should like to direct
my comments to what the Standing Committee on Finance chose to do concerning one
aspect of the housing problem area, that of
university dormitories. Honourable senators
will find this subject dealt with under item
3, page 248 of the committee's report of
proceedings.
I make this choice because all problem
areas having a direct or indirect connection
with education are of special interest and
concern to me, and because comprehensive
comment has already been given to some of
the other thorny and important problem
areas in this field of housing. I make no
apology for pleading the cause of education
in this one specific aspect, and I shall continue to do so, because the cause of education
is crucial in its significance to the national
development of our human resources. I must
confess that I am deeply disappointed-and I
am sure all young people share that disappointment with me-but not undaunted, not
disillusioned, by what in essence is a noncommittal, a somewhat apathetically sympathetic, and certainly more negative than
positive, response on the part of the committee to what was in effect a restrained
and modest plea for assistance on the part
of the National Conference of Canadian
Universities to meet the rapidly developing
housing problems at our universities and
colleges.
I had hoped that the committee would
recommend the amendment of section 16 of
the National Housing Act permitting loans by
Central Mortgage and Housing Corporation
for long terms at reasonable rates of interest,
on terms similar to those accorded to limiteddividend companies or, at least, make some
definite recommendation that the Government
should make it possible for the universities

and colleges to get the kind of loans they
need on an insured or guaranteed basis.
Honourable senators, before I examine with
you more closely what our report does say
in this respect, let us think briefly about the
general problem area facing colleges and
universities. It seems vitally important to
remember that this student residence problem
is just one aspect of a greater problem which
the universities and colleges face, a problem
which has been described as a continuing
and rapidly unfolding crisis of higher education in Canada. "Crisis" is a harsh word,
but it causes us to stop and think, for it
embraces the problem of providing the democratic youth of Canada with the quantity and
quality of higher education needed.
It is not my purpose to discuss this overall
context of what are the needs and problems
of higher education in Canada, in the light
of the growing need of our economy, in the
light of our national needs as we compare
our performance with that of other countries,
some of which may not be friendly towards
our country, and in the light of the rapidly
changing international milieu, which is ever
more challenging to the Western democracies.
It is important to remember that the colleges
and universities are facing what might be
called a flood of numbers about to descend
upon them.
Honourable senators, in 1955 Dr. Sheffield,
of the Dominion Bureau of Statistics, made
certain calculations; he projected the university enrolment forward to 1964-65 and came
up with some figures. The enrolment of
1958 shows he underestimated this year by
12 per cent. In other words, three years after
his calculations, we have far more people
at the universities than he estimated. Last
year a further estimate was made for the
Gordon Commission. This year we have a
total university enrolment of 86,500, and it
is estimated that by 1964-65-that is the fall
of 1964-we will have 133,000 students. By
subtracting the present figure from the estimated figure, we find we will have to deal
with and provide for an additional approximately 50,000 students in the short space of
five or six years. And if we estimate that
the classrooms, the gyms, the laboratories,
and so on, for which the estimates are fairly
accurate, will cost $5,000 or $6,000 per new
student, it follows that, merely for classrooms for instructional purposes, there faces
the universities in the next five or six years
an outlay of $250 million to $300 million.
Then within that general context of needed
instructional facilities is the provision of an
instructional staff. It is within that total
context that one must consider the problem
of housing students; so this is but one segment of the overall problem of providing

or faculty, and lately hospital residences for
nurses and internes have been included in
this legislation.
In 1956 the legislation provided that loans
should not exceed 100 per cent of the costand that is very generous-and should be at
the rate of 2 per cent per annum or 1 of a
per cent above the interest rate paid by the
Housing and Home Finance Agency for
Treasury Funds, and should be for a term of
not more than 50 years. Unfortunately I was
unable to ascertain the current interest rate,
but I want to point out that as of April 1,
1958, the amount that had been authorized
under this United States Federal Government
College Housing Loan Fund was $925 million. On June 19, 1958, the United States
Senate Committee on Banking and Commerce
reported favourably on an additional housing
bill, S-3399, which included $400 million more
for college housing loans.
So I must conclude by making this frank
admission. I am pleading for what I know and
believe to be a very worthy cause, and I
venture to suggest with great respect but
with equally great conviction that the
universities and the colleges deserve better
from us than this barely tepid, hesitant,
innocuous "we-sympathize-with-you-but-let'sstudy-it-some-more" statement with which we
end this section of our report, after suggesting that now is not the time to ask the Government to make amendments to the National
Housing Act to assist the badly pressed
universities and colleges. I suggest that now
is indeed as pressing and as appropriate a
time as will ever be presented to this honourable chamber. Let our voice on behalf of
the youth of Canada be loud, clear and
unmistakable.
Hon. Mr. Taylor (Wes±morland): Honourable senators, on behalf of the honourable
gentleman from Toronto-Spadina (Hon. Mr.
Croîl), I move adjournment of the debate.
Hon. R. B. Horner: Honourable senators,
if I mayThe Hon. the Speaker: I would point out
that if the honourable gentleman from Blaine
Lake (Hon. Mr. Horner) speaks now his
remarks will have the effect of closing the
debate.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: His Honour the
Speaker is undoubtedly correct, under the
rule, but may I suggest that the bouse
unanimously consent to waive the rule and
allow the honourable gentleman from Blaine
Lake to proceed at this time?
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: I support that suggestion, because I understand the honourable
senator from Blaine Lake cannot be present
on Monday.

Hon. Mr. Horner: That is right.
The Hon. the Speaker: Has the honourable
gentleman from Blaine Lake unanimous
consent of the bouse to proceed at this time
without closing the debate?
Hon. Senators: Agreed.
Hon. Mr. Horner: First of all, may I congratulate the honourable senator frorn
Queens-Shelburne (Hon. Mr. Smith) and the
honourable junior senator from Winnipeg
(Hon. Mr. Wali) on the excellent speeches
they have delivered on this subject. I want
to explain my position with respect to this
report, and to point out that the purpose of
the Finance Committee's meetings was to
discuss and study housing under Central
Mortgage and Housing Corporation. It was
a housing proposition. It is true that, as the
honourable junior senator from Winnipeg
pointed out, some of the educationists who
appeared before us stated that students in
residence make a slightly better grading
than non-resident students. However, my
experience when raising a family was that
my children made far greater educational
progress while they were living at home than
when they were in residence.
I would point out that the present position of this country is different from what
it was before, say, 1930. The provinces have
their own natural resources, and while the
Prairie provinces were not developing their
resources to any great extent until recent
years, some are now becoming wealthy from
their oil and mineral resources. And they are
boasting about it. In fact, some of the educationists who appeared before us were from
Alberta, a province which should have no
difficulty whatsoever in building all the dormitories or hostel accommodation needed for
the students of its university. The University
of Saskatchewan, at Saskatoon, has a dormitory. I don't know whether it is working out
too well, but I do know that the whole area
surrounding the university bas been built
up to a large extent-perhaps on loans from
C.M.H.C.-by people who intend to take
university students into their homes. It does
not seem to me to be necessary to have to
build dormitories in order to house thousands
of students. At any rate, it is a subject that
I did not think our committee had any right
at all to consider.
As to a certain method of financing that this
Government has undertaken recently, let
me say that while I do not pretend to be a
financial genius I feel that if the Government
has obligations to meet in the future and it
is not just certain of the conditions which
will prevail at that time, and if it will be
obliged in the meantime to raise additional
funds, then I think that the conversion loan

SENATE
was a great stroke of business on the part
of the Government. I believe we would have
much less money for Central Mortgage and
Housing Corporation if the Government had
not done what it did. It was good business
to float a long-term loan and retire bonds
nearing maturity.
I was opposed to making any special recommendations having to do with education,
because, first of all, it is a provincial matter,
and, secondly, every one of the provinces,
with the help they are getting from the
dominion Government, is in a position to take
care of its own educational requirements.

BUSINESS OF THE SENATE
Hon. Mr. Aselline: Honourable senators,
before the bouse adjourns I would like to
draw the attention of honourable senators to
the fact that the Banking and Commerce
Committee will meet at 2 o'clock on Monday
next to consider the measure referred to last
evening. The fact that an honourable senator
may not be a member of that committee does
not prevent him from attending, or even from

asking questions, and I hope that when the
meeting convenes there will be a really good
attendance.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Will any organizations
or individuals who want to give evidence have
an opportunity to do so?
Hon. Mr. Aselline: I understood from the
chairman of the committee, before he left
yesterday, that some will attend.
Hon. Mr. Lamberi: If the committee is to
meet at 2 p.m. there will only be an hour
before the Senate convenes.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I was going to ask if

the committee could convene in the late afteror evening, instead of at 2 p.m.

Hon. Mr. Aseltine: I thought that if the
meeting got well under way and made good
progress, the Senate might adjourn temporarily during pleasure and resume in the
evening. That might be worth considering,
but I have not had an opportunity of discussing it with the Leader of the Opposition (Hon.
Mr. Macdonald).

SECOND READING

The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators,
when shall this bill be read the second time?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: Honourable senators,
with leave of the Senate, I move second
reading of this bill now.
This bill is very simple and I can state
the purpose of it in a very few words. The
Board of Trade of the City of Toronto is
desirous of changing its name to "The Board
of Trade of Metropolitan Toronto", because
some 60 per cent of the membership of the
board are in that area surrounding the
boundaries of the city of Toronto and they
function with the metropolitan area and have
a community interest there as well. Other
amendments in the bill are incidentai to the
changing of the name. There is a furtherbut I must not say incidental-feature of
the bill. The present practice is that the
President and Vice-President of the board
are sworn into office by the Mayor of the
city of Toronto, but when this bill becomes
law the chairman of the Metropolitan Council
of Toronto with the dignity which befits
his office, will be the one to take the oath.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Are there any other
boards of trade at present in that area?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: I can tell my honourable
friend that any boards of trade in that area
have expressed their approval of this change
in name, and even the Metropolitan Council
has approved of the change.
Motion agreed to and bill read second time.

SUSPENSION

OF RULE

Hon. Mr. Hayden moved, with leave:
That Rule 119 be suspended in so far as it
relates to the Bill (S-17) intituled "An Act respecting the Board of Trade of the City of Toronto".

He said: Honourable senators, suspension
of Rule 119 is moved for the purpose of
eliminating the necessity of posting up in
the lobby one week's notice of the sitting of
the committee, in so far as this bill is
concerned.
Motion agreed to.

BUSINESS OF THE SENATE
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Honourable senators, I
propose to move that the Senate do now

adjourn during pleasure, to resume at the
call of the bell at 8 o'clock this evening.
The reason is that the Banking and Commerce
committee now bas before it the important
Estates Tax Bill, and almost all honourable
senators present in the chamber will wish to
hear the presentations to be made before that
committee, which will resume its sitting when
the Senate rises.
The Senate adjourned during pleasure.
At 8 p.m. the sitting was resumed.
THE LATE SENATOR MARCOTTE
TRIBUTES

Hon. W. M. Asel±ine: Honourable senators,

during the dinner hour I was very much
saddened and grieved by the news, which
arrived at that time, of the sudden passing
of my distinguished colleague the Honourable
Arthur Marcotte, of Ponteix, in the province
of Saskatchewan.
Honourable senators probably know that I
have been intimately associated with the
late senator, not only during the 25 years
that he has been a member of this house,
but for many years before. He was very
active in politics in Saskatchewan, of which
province he was also one of the pioneer
barristers and solicitors, and for 10 years or
more he was president of the Gravelbourg
Bar Association.
I first met him when he was engaged in
political activities. At one time he was candidate for the provincial Legislature, and in
1926 he stood for the federal Parliament. In
neither contest was he successful, but he
made a fine name for himself in the southern
part of Saskatchewan, where he carried on
his practice. He was very highly regarded,
not only by the legal profession but by the
farming community, because he was also intimately connected with agriculture and carried on quite extensive farming operations in
the part of Saskatchewan where he lived, and
where he owned a large tract of land. He
continued until his death to own quite a
considerable acreage.
Senator Marcotte was so unfortunate as
to lose, a few years ago, his dear wife. This
bereavement seemed to have a bad effect
upon him physically, and during the last five
or six years, he was not in good health and
did not take as active a part in Senate affairs
as he had done formerly.
Honourable senators will remember that he
was particularly interested in Civil Service
administration. He always regarded himself

as a friend of the Civil Service, and for many
years was chairman of our committee on its
administration.
As I have already mentioned, the late senator, for forty years or more, took a very
active interest in all public affairs in Saskatchewan. The people of that province will
learn with very much regret of his sudden
death. But, honourable senators, he lived to
a fine age. I understand he was born in 1873;
and none of us can expect to remain on this
earth for a much longer time than he did. He
has a son who is a barrister, and one daughter.
I wish to extend to them my deepest sympathy
and regret. I know that as long as they live
they will carry many happy memories of their
father.
Hon. John T. Haig: Honourable senators,
I join with the honourable Leader of the
Government (Hon. Mr. Aseltine) in expressing
sympathy to the family of the late Senator
Marcotte. I knew him well before he came to
this chamber. He was a prominent barrister
in his district of Saskatchewan, and we in
Manitoba who had business to do up in his
large territory always used him as our agent.
He knew his district well and he could always
be trusted. He took an active part in the
Canadian Bar Association whenever he was
free to do so. I recall that a senator friend
of mine from Manitoba, whose mother tongue
was French, was very delighted when Senator
Marcotte was appointed to this chamber, in
1931. He said to me, "Now 'll have somebody
from the west who can talk to me in my own
language."
As my honourable friend has said, Senator
Marcotte was well informed on agricultural
matters. Whenever I had occasion to write
to him about some farmer or farm operation
in his district I was always well satisfied with
the information he supplied me.
I had the pleasure once of sitting in the
Manitoba Legislature with a gentleman whose
mother tongue was French. He was really
a one-language man at first, but over the
years he learned to speak English. When he
had been in the Legislature for some 30 years
he and I went to a political meeting, at which
he addressed the audience in French. After
he finished I said to him, "Joe, I don't understand French very well, but judging by the
way the people acted I think you made a
rotten speech tonight." He replied, "I can talk
about ordinary matters in French, but not
politics."
One afternoon, years later, when I had the
luck to be sitting where the Leader of the
Opposition (Hon. Mr. Macdonald) is sitting
now, I said to Senator Marcotte that a certain bill was coming up and that I wished he
would speak in French on it because I knew

AUGUST 18, 1958
that some Government members intended to
do so. He looked at me and said, "Are you
pulling my leg?" I replied: "No, I want you
to do that. It calls for a real job and you
are the only man who can do it." He replied
that he couldn't do it, saying, "I can talk in
French about ordinary business, but when I
get into matters of law I have to speak in
English, as I do in my own predominantly
English-speaking district." I thought it was
rather interesting that both the Manitoba
Legislature and this chamber should have
had a French-speaking member who encountered that difficulty.
Honourable senators who have been here
for only four or five years would not have
known Senator Marcotte as well as those who
have been here a long time. Perhaps I
shouldn't mention this, but whenever he came
into this chamber he was the picture of a
tailor's ideal of a well-dressed man. He knew
styles exactly; and he was a gentleman.
Whenever I went home to Winnipeg, men who
knew him well asked, "How is Senator
Marcotte?" They told me how they liked
him and enjoyed his company.
Honourable senators, the late Senator
Marcotte left a fine impression with this
house. Within the last five years he was not
well, and had not the vigour of earlier days,
but we enjoyed having him with us. In this
house we shall miss him greatly. Many
people in my province also will be saddened
by the passing of our colleague, the senator
from Ponteix, Saskatchewan.
Hon. W. Ross Macdonald: Honourable senators, it was indeed a great shock to me, as
it was to all honourable senators, when we
returned to this building after the dinner
hour this evening, to learn that Senator Marcotte had passed away at about 4.30 this afternoon. If he was not here last week, he
was surely here the week before, when he
appeared to be in reasonably good health.
As the Leader of the Government (Hon. Mr.
Aseltine) said, the late senator attained the
splendid age of 85 years. Of course, he could
not have hoped to go on for a great many
more years, but in this day and age, when
people are living longer, no one here thought
he might soon be leaving us.
I did not know Senator Marcotte as long
as did the other two honourable senators who
have spoken. In fact, while I was in the
House of Commons, I had merely met him
from time to time. When I came to this house,
however, I received a very warm welcome
from him. During all the time I have been
iere, in my capacity both as Leader of the
Government and as Leader of the Opposition,
he was exceptionally friendly toward me
and a very fine counsellor. On July 6 last
that he wrote me a note saying that he had
57075-4-38j

been called to the Senate 27 years ago. I had
intended to rise and congratulate him that
day, but unfortunately he left the chamber
during the speech which was in progress at
the time I received his note. I followed him
to the door and asked him to come back, but
he said he would prefer that no mention be
made of the anniversary.
I shall indeed miss Senator Marcotte
greatly. We can say of him that he was a
statesman, a prominent lawyer, and a sportsman. A statesman we know he was, from
what he had done during his lifetime, and
especially from his actions in this house when
serving on certain committees, more particularly, as the Leader of the Government
mentioned, on the Civil Service Committee.
The honourable senior senator from Winnipeg (Hon. Mr. Haig) referred to him as a
prominent lawyer. I knew something of his
ability as a lawyer, because he took a keen
interest in all questions affecting our Constitution. I think he was one of the most eminent
constitutional lawyers in this house, and he
made a very valuable contribution to the
work of the Senate in that capacity.
I also said he was a sportsman and I might
remind honourable senators, as the Leader
of the Government has just a moment ago
reminded me in a note that he sent to me,
that Senator Marcotte was at one time the
billiards champion of America. I recall mentioning that to him at one time and he said,
"Yes, I was, but unfortunately I am playing
billiards no longer." I think he was then 82
years of age. But he said he still loved the
game. He told me that it was a great thing
to play billiards. He said that when he had
problems it helped him greatly to play the
game, that it calmed his nerves and had a
good effect on not only his health but on his
attitude toward his fellowmen. Of course, he
was always a very friendly soul, and I know
we shall all miss him in this house.
I join in the expression of sincere sympathy to our late colleague's family.
(Translation):
Hon. Cyrille Vaillancouri: Honourable senators, the Senate is like a large family, and
the demise of a senator is felt as deeply as
the loss of a member of our own family.
I have just heard the Leader of the Government and the Leader of the Opposition recall
old memories of Senator Marcotte. But, even
though I may not be the oldest member of
the Senate, I think I have had the privilege
of knowing him longer than anyone else.
It has been said that Senator Marcotte was
a good billiard player. In 1906, when I was still
at college, billiards was the favourite sport
of the well-behaved students. Senator Marcotte had come to Levis college to teach us

SENATE
the game. And, as my leader has said, he
later became billiard champion of Canada.
His opponent had absolutely no chance; be
played stroke upon stroke. He was a crack
player.
But he indulged in other activities. When
he opened a law office in Ponteix, he chose
as his partner Mr. Lacourcière, one of my
fellow students. The office was well run and
most successful. Maître Marcotte, as he was
then called, was known as a very able lawyer
and his young associate, who had been at
the head of his class at college, was a brilliant
man.
Senator Marcotte also contributed greatly
to the public affairs of this country. From
1925 to 1929 be was president of the French
Canadian Association of Saskatchewan.
As I said, my first contact with Senator
Marcotte was over the billiard table. We
marvelled at his skill. As a young man,
when he was secretary at the Quebec Parliament, he took part in billiard tournaments.
At that time, he had already acquired a
good standing with the provincial authorities.
Senator Marcotte is gone. No longer shall
we sec him enter the Senate quietly, and we
shall miss his daily visit to this chamber. A
few minutes ago, coming out of the Parliamentary restaurant, I asked one of the attendants what had become of the senator,
whom no one had seen at the restaurant. That
is when I learned that he had just passed on.
He served the Senate and his country well
and we owe him a debt of gratitude. To
his family, I extend my most sincere condolences.
(Text):
Hon. Norman P. Lamberi: Honourable
senators, on behalf of those of us who live in
the neighbouring province of Ontario, and
have an opportunity now and then to voice
a warm and sincere expression of sympathy
for one who had for many years in his later
life lived in Montreal, I feel impelled to
refer to some of my own associations with
the late Senator Marcotte during my period
of membership here.
When he sat on the Opposition side and
I sat on the Government side, a number of
occasions arose when we exchanged views
with respect to the place of the Senate in
relation to the rights of the provinces. I
shall always remember how well versed he
was and how definite his opinions were with
respect to that subject. He was strongly of
the opinion that the Senate was the guardian
of provincial interests in this country. He
often went so far as to insist that when

communications between the federal Government and the provinces were necessary they
should be made in writing from the head
of the Government here to the head of the
Government in the province, and in no other
way.
The late Senator Marcotte was very well
acquainted with the constitutional history
of Canada and could hold his own in any
discussion on that subject. I had the pleasure of conversing with him on many occasions and found him a most convivial friend.
I know that his interest in the earlier history
of this country was extensive.
The Clerk of this house at the beginning
of the century was Mr. St. Onge Chapleau,
a brother of the Honourable Adolph Chapleau, a member of Sir John A. Macdonald's
Government. The senator knew the Chapleau
family intimately, and I learned a good many
things about the relations of the Chapleaus
not only in this house but in public affairs
elsewhere in the country. He and they had
a common early background in Terrebonne,
Quebec.
Reference bas also been made to the late
senator's versatility in other fields than those
affecting constitutional questions. As the
honourable Leader of the Opposition (Hon.
Mr. Macdonald) has pointed out, he was a
great billiard player. I recall he told me he
once played against Willie Hoppe in the old
pavilion in Quebec City when the future
champion of the world had to stand on a
box at the side of the table to reach up to
play his shots. Fifty years later, as he was
leaving here one evening, be told me he was
going back to Quebec City to preside at a
ceremony in connection with the opening of
a new pavilion to replace the one where be
had played as a young man, and that he
intended to play a game of billiards to celebrate the occasion.
It was in 1951, I believe, that reference
was made to his 20 years of membership in
this house. I recall his standing here at that
time and stating that throughout that period
be had never missed attendance at a single
session of this house. I think this constitutes
a record. At any rate, no one was more
devoted to and more interested in the proceedings of this chamber than he. I shall
always remember him with a great deal of
warmth, because, besides being a chivalrous
debater and opponent, be could be a good
friend.
Hon. Wishar± McL. Robertson: Honourable
senators, I, too, would like to add a word
of appreciation of the record of Senator
Marcotte. During the days that I was Governrnent Leader in this bouse I received from
him nothing but unfailing courtesy. There is
very little left for me to say about his record;

AUGUST 18, 1958
but I remember one circumstance which is
a little at variance with the recollection of
the honourable senior senator from Ottawa
(Hon. Mr. Lambert). He was right in saying
that in the matter of attendance over 20
years the late Senator Marcotte achieved a
record for attendance which has never been
equalled; but on one occasion, through an
odd circumstance, he found it necessary to
be absent from a sitting here; and that occasion was the outbreak of war, when he was
in Europe. He embarked in ample time to
be present at the opening of Parliament, but
the exigencies of warfare diverted the ship
elsewhere, with the result that his progress
was delayed a few days.
In his interest in the proceedings of this
house his record is an enviable one, and
everything which bas been said about him
by the honourable Leader of the Government
(Hon. Mr. Aseltine) and the honourable
Leader of the Opposition (Hon. Mr. Macdonald) is well merited. I pay my tribute to
a scholar and a gentleman.

him useful information, characteristic of a
broadminded man who had known and observed much more than we had concerning
other races in this country. He explained to
us the problems of our people, the conditions
which affected them, and told us what in his
view was good for the country. In view of
this experience, we consulted him time and
again. I saw him recently-I believe at the
beginning of last weekSenator Croll: He was here on Friday.
Hon. Mr. Monette: I was amazed, as I talked
with him, at his knowledge of what I might
call the psychology of what was going on
on both sides and in either bouse of Parliament, and I was reminded of the saying of
Madame de Staël, La vérité est dans les dessous-"The truth is underground".
He
explained the meaning of this and that circumstance which I had observed, and as I
say, I was astonished, even in these last days,
when he could hardly walk, and it seemed
difficult to believe that there remained life
in him, at the clarity of his mind, the
reliability of his information, and the soundness of his advice-especially the soundness
of his advice, of which I have personal
knowledge, and which I wish to emphasize.
In losing Senator Marcotte we have lost a
man who, though latterly for some time, because of sickness, was limited in his activities,
showed by his life, and especially in these
latter days, that the Roman maxim, Mens
sana in corpore sano can be disproved. For
he was not in good health, he was weak to
an extreme degree, yet his mind was very
sound, and serviceable to everyone who consulted him.
[Later:]
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Honourable Senators, I
would like to inform you that the remains of
the late Senator Marcotte are being taken
tonight to the funeral home of J. S. Vallee,
on Park Avenue near St. Viateur Street, in
Montreal, where they will remain until
Friday morning. The funeral service will be
held Friday morning at St. Madeleine Church,
Outremont Avenue, Outremont, Quebec. No
time has yet been fixed for the service, but
details as to time, etc., will be published in
the Montreal Star and La Presse tomorrow
night. Burial will be at Ste. Therese de
Blainville, Quebec.
Senator Marcotte's daughter lives in Montreal. His son's address in Ottawa is 105 Glen,
Avenue, telephone No. CE 5-6285.

Hon. Gustave Monette: Honourable senators, I wish to add a few words. My acquaintance with the honourable Senator Marcotte
was not limited to the past 20 or 25 years;
I had known him before that. As bas been
said, he used to visit Montreal quite often,
although he had settled in the west, where
he was living when he became a senator,
and he was an adviser to people out there.
Our Constitution makes it is not only
possible but desirable that there shall be
opposition. We have in both houses of Parliament an official Opposition, and it is said,
and I thoroughly believe it, especially since
I have been here, that this system operates
for the promotion of good legislation and for
the welfare of the country. Not only in
national politics but throughout the community, the presence of groups and of various
races works to the national benefit. I refer
not only to the two original groups whose
official languages are recognized here-the
French and the English-but to the new
Canadians of all races. They are destined to
be helpful in the development of this country
of ours.
The late Senator Marcotte was one of those
who recognized this fact. He interested himself particularly in the welfare of our French
and Catholic people on the western prairies.
Reference to his services in this respect has
been made by the honourable senator from
Kennebec (Hon. Mr. Vaillancourt), and I know
something about it because, before I went into

Honourable senators, with the large number
of unemployed at the present time and labour
trouble appearing on the horizon, there are
some things that we have to do, and do rather
quickly. When I speak of low-cost housing
Two of the

reasons why we have not more low-cost housing in this country at the present time are
that we have not any serviced land and that
municipalities are incapable of financing the
services that are required. The municipalities,
where the greatest need exists and where the
greatest market exists, demand that subdividers provide sewers, water and road facilities. These costs are initially applied on
the lot and passed on to the purchaser of a
house, so the purchaser has to make a larger
down payment than would otherwise be
necessary. People who think they are buying
low-cost housing are really not doing so. The
need of the municipalities is a very urgent
one, in order that they can finance sewer,
water and road facilities as they have been
traditionally financed, as local improvements,
spread over a period of 20 or 30 years-the
statute differs between various provinces. If
the lot is cheaper, the house is cheaper, the
down payment is lower, and the monthly
payment spread over a longer period of time
is lower. Then we are able to have low-cost
housing, which is not a municipal problem,
not a provincial problem, but a national problem. We have our part to play in it, and we
are not playing it as we ought to.
The municipalities require money, and they
require cheap money. Yes, if you like, they
require subsidized money. We do a lot of
subsidizing in various ways by acts of Parliament; we subsidize education and universities; we have subsidized by way of price
supports, by way of tariffs; and we subsidize
the Canadian National Railways. We are
sometimes accused of subsidizing bondholders,
too. There was a discussion in this house the
other day on the present conversion loan
of $6 billion, at 4½ per cent for 25 years,
non-callable. I think it was indicated that
it would cost us $60 million a year for 25
years. Press reports today indicate that it
is likely to be $70 million for 25 years, which
is $11 billion for that length of time. Those
who have been contending that 4j per cent
raises the interest rates for the people of
this country have a case, for if the Dominion
pays 412 per cent interest, the provinces pay
4 of 1 per cent to j of 1 per cent more,

depending upon the financial strength of the
province, and the municipalities pay j of 1
per cent to 1 of 1 per cent more, depending
upon the financial strength of the municipality,
and large corporations going to the public
pay something in addition to what the municipalities pay, the result is that the individual
is left with 7 per cent money. That is the
prevailing interest rate today. It is a high
rate to pay, and we will be paying that
sort of a tribute in this country for many
years. Sometimes it seems to me that people
responsible for that state of condition are
economic delinquents.
It is well to take a look at the municipal
responsibility. It stems from the fact that the
tax base is much too narrow and certainly
should be enlarged beyond real estate and
licence fees. I know it will be said that we
have nothing to do with the municipal government, that it is the creature of the provincial government. No one needs to point that
out to me, because I established the Department of Municipal Affairs in the province of Ontario in 1934 and I know where
the responsibility lies; but certainly we cannot shed total responsibility, and, as I repeat,
the municipal taxation system was designed
for a purpose and to be effective almost
100 years ago. It has outlived its usefulness
and cannot meet present conditions. In the
light of forecasts of increased population
in the years ahead, as indicated by the
Gordon Commission, the matter becomes
urgent, and unless something is done almost
immediately the worst is yet to come. The
municipalities have come for assistance to
the provinces, and they have come for assistance to the dominion Government, without effect. I think the Prime Minister of this
country indicated recently that there will
be a meeting between the dominion Government and the provinces and the municipalities some time this year.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I did not think the
provinces were to be included. I understood
the meeting was to be between the federal
Government and the municipalities.
Hon. Mr. Croll: Were the provinces not
to be included? I thought the three groups
were to meet together, but I may be wrong.
In any event, we have to give consideration
to this matter. There is the direct tax, a
purely municipal tax, for roads, sewers,
water, police and fire departments, and
power. Here the municipal taxpayer pays
for what he gets. I do not think he complains. It is higher in some places, and lower
in others, depending on the efficiency of the
municipal government. Overall the people get
pretty good local government. There is
another tax, indirect in concept, which I
think should be measured by the ability to
pay, that is, the indigent tax, the hospital

SENATE
tax, the juvenile cause, welfare and education. These should not be municipal responsibilities; they should be shared between the
Dominion and the province, and the municipality should bear, if anything at all, no
more than the administrative cost. I think
the time has come when there should be a
clear line of demarcation between those two
forms of taxation and it should be clearly
understood, and yet we find that both the
province and the Dominion are staving off,
pushing off the municipalities and putting
off the evil day. We need in this country
a new concept of municipal taxation in order
that we can put our own house in order.
One of the things holding back housing in
Canada is the fact that we fail to understand
the scope of taxation and we demand too
much from the municipalities. We make them
offers that we will pay up to 75 percent
toward acquiring land for housing purposes
if the province will pay 25 percent, and the
province gladly enters into an agreement and
then goes to the municipality and says, "We
want you to pay 121 per cent of that, but if
you cannot pay 12, per cent you must pay
10 per cent." The municipality says, "We
cannot pay 10, we cannot pay anything at
all," and so housing stalls and nothing is
donc.
Some provinces recognize the plight of the
municipalities. In British Columbia house
owners receive a benefit of $28, which is
fully applicable to the municipal tax bill. In
Alberta a dividend is received; one was $20,
and the next year it was $17.50. That of
course goes to all people in the province,
but I understand that is likely to be discontinued, if I read an announcement clearly
tonight. It seems that that is not attractive
enough to the voter, as I gather from the
announcement.
Hon. Mr. Howard: There must be an election coming up.
Hon. Mr. Croll: In Ontario the home owner
receives a direct benefit. The province makes
an unconditional grant which must be passed
on by the urban or rural municipality to
home owners. The grant last year was 2
mills. I point out to you that the provinces
are not completely blind to the needs of the
municipalities except where it will cost the
provinces money and they do not want to
do anything about it. In any event, what
we are having is a piecemeal attempt to solve
these problems. And yet the home owner is
carrying a very great burden. But there is
one way that the Dominion can assist these
municipalities. There is on the statute books
at the present time an act called the Municipal Improvements Assistance Act. It was
passed on the 24th of June, 1938, and amended

on the 27th of June, 1947. The original concept of the act was to assist, to help
employment by making loans on municipal
self-liquidating projects. The word "selfliquidating" was given a very wide interpretation-but remember, it was to help
employment, that was the reason. I point out
to the honourable Leader of the Government
that when I dealt with the employment
figures it was not my purpose to rub salt on
a wound and I was not laying any blame. I
read a government announcement today, that
was where I obtained my figures.
Many applications were made under that
act and very few were rejected. A vast
number were approved. Not one penny that
was loaned out under the act is in arrears
and I believe that every payment has been
met. Later on I will indicate who borrowed
the money and for what purpose.
Under the act the municipality made an
application for a self-liquidating project,
obtained the approval of the Lieutenant
Governor in Council, and it was guaranteed
by the province. The rate of interest was
2 per cent. Every one of the provinces
participated, except Ontario. I said that the
term "self-liquidating" had a very wide
interpretation. Under that act loans were
made for municipal buildings, water-mains,
street pavings, water-works, filtration plants
and schools. What I am concerned with
tonight are water-mains, water-works and
street paving. It may interest honourable
senators to know that under this act the cities
of Vancouver and Pictou and the town of
Annapolis Royal obtained money for school
construction. The act could be used for school
construction at the present time to make
money available to these municipalities in
order to bring down the cost of education.
Now, for the edification of the members of
the house let me indicate to you how the
money was spent and where it was spent.
In Prince Edward Island, Montague built
a municipal building under the act.
In

Nova

Scotia, Pictou got two schools;

Annapolis Royal got a school; Sydney got
an installation of water-mains and a sewer
system; and Kentville a water filtration
plant.
In New Brunswick, Bathurst and Marysville did street paving-Bathurst got $50,000
and Marysville, $15,000. Edmundston did
some street paving and Dalhousie did a
municipal building.
In Quebec: Rimouski did a water project;
so did Amos. Amos did a rather extensive
one-it cost $197,000. Granby got a city hall.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: What did it cost?
Hon. Mr. Croll: $73,000.

AUGUST 18, 1958
Montreal did not do badly. It installed a
sewer system construction for $630,000, and
traffic lights to the extent of $220,000. Chicoutimi built a filtration plant. Quebec City
got a water-main construction for $340,000.
All this money has been paid back.
I just indicate to you the possibilities.
I have something more to say about that.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: May I ask the honourable senator a question? Were these amounts
advanced by way of loans or actual gifts?
Hon. Mr. Croll: They were loans at the rate
of 2 per cent, and all are repaid. That is my
point.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: How many years ago?
Hon. Mr. Croll: 1950.
Hon. Mr. Bruni: Money rates have since
gone up.
Hon. Mr. Croll: All moneys by way of
interest and principal have, I understand,
been repaid, and most of these loans have
been liquidated.
Hon. Mr. Taylor (Wes±morland): Is the city
of Fredericton mentioned there for a loan to
build the Victoria Public Hospital?
Hon. Mr. Croll: Yes, I see an item for
$200,000 to Fredericton, and $112,000 to Saint
John. But I am just taking the highlightsI miss the little sums.
Hon. Mr. Bruni: What about Manitoba?
Hon. Mr. Croll: Winnipeg had replacement
of water-mains; Manitoba did a street paving
job, and so on. Saskatchewan, I see, took
advantage of the act, as it had a right to do,
and did more projects than any other province. They include water-works improvements at Prince Albert, water-manis at Moose
Jaw, an electric utility building at Saskatoon,
improvements in an electrical utility at
Regina, street paving at Saskatoon installing
a water system at Humboldt, extending
water-works at Regina, and replacing water
mains at Rosetown.
In Alberta, I see Edmonton replaced street
cars with a trolley bus system at a cost of
$150,000, under this very wide interpretation
of self-liquidation. Calgary got a municipal
garage improvement, an airport hangar and
administration building, and-this is hard to
interpret-$46,000 for additions and improvements to buildings. But these have all been
repaid, and the municipality has a right to
make use of the act.
I see another big item from Alberta; installation of water and sewer systems at Hanna,
$100,000. Then in British Columbia, in Vancouver city, some schools were constructed
at a cost of $390,000, and water-works, at
$100,000.

Altogether, some 109 loans were approved.
Ontario did not participate.
Hon. Mr. Pearson: In what year were
those loans made?
Hon. Mr. Croll: They were made up to
1950. I do not have any information beyond
that date. These are merely examples of what
can be done under the act at the present
time by way of getting 2 per cent money.
You may feel that is subsidized money. I
think we should stop screaming about subsidization: as I indicated earlier, we are
doing a great deal of subsidizing.
Hon. Mr. Pearson: A loan is not a subsidy.
Hon. Mr. Croll: No, but some people may
call 2 per cent interest a subsidizing of
interest. I don't call it that, and I am happy
to know my friend agrees that it is not a
subsidy. That is the point I am trying to
make, because we need low-cost housing in
this country. We have lots of poor people;
we have deserted wives, we have incurable
people, persons unemployed by reason of
physical and mental defects. These unfortunates represent 6 per cent of our population.
And in addition we have ever so many people
in lower-income brackets who require lowcost housing. We have the ability and the
facilities right here to make money available
to the municipalities now, at a time when
we are facing what appears to be a hard
winter. We must find some way to put the
people to work.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: We are building more
houses now than ever before.
Hon. Mr. Croll: Of course we are, and
I have said so. But we will continue to need
more. I take no consolation in saying there
are unemployed. I hope I am never in a
position to say to the Government side of
the house, "We have unemployment and you
are responsible for it". Believe me, I would
much prefer to say, "We have full employment in this country". Having gone through
the hungry thirties, I thought we would never
again see the type of unemployment we
have at the present time. I am trying to
suggest to this house, and to the people who
are prepared to listen, that the great problem
we will face this year is winter unemployment. We have always had it to some extent,
and we have it now more than before. Here
is a way of meeting it. If we don't choose
to use this act generally, surely we can say
to the municipalities which need help, "We
will make money available for works to
relieve winter unemployment.
The works
should start in September or October and
finish in February. For this purpose we are
prepared to subsidize by way of low interest

SENATE
rates; we are prepared to interpret the act
so as to provide for the kind of self-liquidating work that was done in the past, under
this act".
My point is, we do not need any new
legislation; it is on the books and we can
use it. Here is the opportunity and here are
the tools. This is a problem and we have
the means of solving it. If we apply our
facilities, it will not lie in the mouth of
anyone to quote figures as I have done tonight
from official documents for this purpose. I
hope the honourable gentleman opposite who
has the car of the Government will remind
it of the concern which I know it truly feels,
indicate what is likely to happen this winter
and point out to it that there are facilities
available by way of the Municipal Improvements Assistance Act to make money available
in a myriad of ways to relieve unemployment
in municipalities.
It has been proven over a long period of
time that the fastest and best way of employing people is through construction. Not only
does it give people wages, but it creates. One
of the tragedies of the depression was that
we spent hundreds of millions of dollars and
in the end had nothing to show for it but
an embittered people. Now, with that experience behind us, we can at least use the
knowledge, the tools, the facilities and money
available to us in order to produce wages
as well as homes. If we build schools or help
lay out subdivisions, construct water mains
or erect hospital buildings, these are things
which will be here for ever, and nothing will
be lost. When we build homes we firm up the
foundation of democracy in this country. We
may as well face the fact that there are
people who need subsidization. This act provides for it. It will cost a few more dollars,
but the returns will be very great.
Of course, I support the report. I had hoped
that it would go further than it does, but at
any rate it is a very worth-while contribution
to thinking on housing in this country, and
is something of which the Senate may well
feel proud. It is the kind of work which the
Senate does very well.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Robertson, debate
adjourned.
EXCISE TAX BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. Clarence V. Emerson moved the
second reading of Bill C-44, to amend the
Excise Tax Act.
He said: Honourable senators, this bill is
intended to implement the budget resolution
affecting the Excise Tax Act. The Excise Tax
Act imposes the general sales tax as well as

special excise taxes on a number of commodities such as automobiles, radios, television sets, jewelry and cosmestics. It will be
found that the bulk of amendments contained
in this bill deal with the sales tax, although
there are several amendments which relate
to the special excise taxes as well. It was
stated in the budget speech that the proposed
amendment to the Excise Tax Act would
reduce revenues in a full year by $10 million
and in 1958-59 by $8 million.
There are only nine clauses to the bill, plus
a schedule. The following notes deal with
each clause and the schedule in turn.
No. 1: new items to be exempt from sales
tax, purchased by municipalities, materials
in sewerage and draining systems.
To enlarge a little upon that: Sewer pipes
and other equipment used in sewerage and
draining systems constitute an important
expenditure for the municipalities. Where
sewers are installed by subdividers or by
contractors they may enter into a contract
whereby the pipe and equipment are furnished by the municipalities and the contractor does the work of installation, or the contractor, on finishing the job for which he
has furnished the pipe and materials as well
as the installation work, may invoice the
municipalities separately for the work donc
and for sewer pipe and equipment sold to
the municipality. The contractor would then
apply for a refund of the sales tax on the
pipe and equipment he has sold to the
municipality.
Structural items: this rounds out the present exemption for structural steel and concrete shapes used in bridges purchased by
municipalities.
Culverts: there is already an exemption for
structural steel and concrete shapes purchased by municipalities for bridges. Considerable difficulty arose in distinguishing
between a bridge and a culvert.
Diesel fuel: this is for the municipalities.
A few municipalities use diesel fuel oil to
drive internal combustion engines, which in
turn drive generators to produce electricity.
An amendment to be found under the heading "processing materials", which I will
come to later, will make it clear that fuel
used in internal combustion engines is generally subject to sales tax. This amendment
will provide an exemption from this general
rule for diesel fuel purchased by municipalities to generate electricity with internal
combustion engines. Coal and fuel oil used
in thermal electric plants are already exempt.
No. 2: a number of new items added to
building materials which are exempt.
No. 3: some new items of interest to farming and horticultural industries have been
added.

AUGUST 18, 1958
No. 4: diesel fuel oil used in logging,
lumbering and mining interest has been
made exempt from sales tax. This amendment clarifies the exemption from sales tax
for goods consumed directly in the production of goods. The present wording of this
part of the schedule is "Materials, not including grease or lubricating oils consumed
or expended directly in the process of manufacture or production of goods". This amendment provides as a general rule that diesel
fuel will be subject to sales tax. However,
the schedule also provides some exceptions
which overrule this general provision.
The first of these exceptions has already
been referred to-that for diesel fuel used
by municipalities to generate electricity.
A further exception is provided by the
closing underlined words under this heading,
which provide an exemption for diesel fuel
oil when used in internal combustion engines
used in logging operations and the manufacture of rough lumber.
The special excise tax on the value of advertising and special editions of non-Canadian
periodicals has now been repealed. In addition
the $2 licence fee has been abolished and a
number of minor amendments to clarify some
points have been made.
Clause 1 of the bill repeals the special
excise tax of 20 per cent on the value of
the advertising material contained in special
editions of non-Canadian periodicals. This
tax was imposed in 1956 and became effective
from January 1, 1957. It produced about $1
million in revenue per year. The Minister
of Finance has given his reasons for repealing this tax, that it was discriminatory
and was not fulfilling its purpose.
Clause 2 of the bill provides that the fee
charged for licences under the Excise Tax
Act will be abolished. Manufacturers and
licensed wholesalers who have to account
for sales tax or special excise taxes will
still be required to take out a license, but
there will be no charge in future and the
licence will be a continuing one instead of
being annual. The present law says that the
minister may prescribe a fee not exceeding
$2. The fee has in fact been $2 in the past.
Clauses 3, 4 and 5 of the bill are consequential on the repeal of the licence fee.
Clause 6 of the bill deals with refunds of
sales tax allowed to certain welfare agencies.
It proposes that the definition of the kind
of welfare organization that is eligible for
a refund of sales tax on its purchases shall
be broadened. It also proposes that refunds
mnay start earlier.
Clause 7 of the bill adds a new administrative provision dealing with proof of return. It is similar in form to the provision
in section 136(14) of the Income Tax Act.

It provides that the production of a return
filed by or on behalf of a taxpayer shall be
accepted as evidence in any proceedings
against the taxpayer.
Clause 8 re-enacts schedule III of the
Excise Tax Act. This is the schedule which
lists the items that are exempt from sales
tax.
The new schedule III re-enacted by this
clause has been rearranged in alphabetical
order. No items have been dropped from the
schedule. All the new items added to the
schedule by this bill are underlined.
Hon. W. Ross Macdonald: Honourable
senators, the honourable gentleman from
Saint John-Albert (Hon. Mr. Emerson) has
given a very good explanation of the bill.
As he has said, it is based on a budget
resolution. It is one of the bills coming before
us to assist the Government in having a
deficit of some $500 million at the end of
the year. I have not got much to complain
about in connection with this bill, but I
would like to point out that while it is a
bill to amend the Excise Tax Act it affects
just the sales tax. There is no reduction in
excise taxes. It will be noticed that there are
four schedules to the act itself, but only
schedule III is referred to in the bill. But
what is schedule I about? It has to do with
the excise taxes, which are the hidden
taxes.
The honourable gentleman who
introduced the bill did not mention the other
tax in the act itself. There are certain goods
on which there is not only a sales tax of 8
per cent but an excise tax. I will just mention some of the items in schedule I.
Paragraph 1 refers to automobiles, on which
there is an excise tax of 7j per cent. Honourable senators will recall that hardly a year
ago there was a great deal of talk about
taking that tax off altogether, but in the bill
before us no mention is made of the excise
tax on automobiles, so it remains at 7j per
cent. In addition, the 8 per cent sales tax
remains on automobiles. It is not removed
by this bill.
Paragraph 2 of schedule I provides for
articles, materials or preparations of whatever
composition or in whatever form, commonly
or commercially known as toilet articles,
and so on. There is a sales tax of 8 per cent
on these articles together with a 10 per cent
excise tax. Let me not neglect to say that
over and above the 8 per cent sales tax there
is an additional 2 per cent tax which goes
toward payment of old age securities. So
the total sales tax is 10 per cent rather than
8 per cent. I mention these points so that
it will be clear to us all what we are paying
under the provisions of the Excise Tax Act
legislation before us now. Schedule I also
applies to devices commonly or commercially

SENATE
known as lighters, on which there is a 10
per cent tax. Then there is a 10 per cent
tax on coin-operated games.
On phonographs, record playing devices,
radio broadcast receiving sets or any combination of the foregoing, and the tubes therefor,
there is a tax of 15 per cent over and above
the 10 per cent sales tax. Then, of course,
the same provision applies to television sets.
You pay an additional 10 per cent on tobacco
pipes and cigar and cigarette holders. Those
of you who smoke cigars pay not only the
10 per cent sales tax but the 15 per cent
excise tax. There is a 10 per cent excise tax
on matches. On clocks and watches adapted
to household or personal useHon. Mr. Aseltine: The honourable senator
is not advocating that all these taxes be
taken off, is he?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: No; but I think we
should clearly understand what we are being
asked to pass tonight. We are asked to pass
an amendment to the Excise Tax Act, but
we are only reducing a portion of the goods
which are included in the sales tax. The
excise tax, in addition to the sales tax, remains on all these articles which I have mentioned. I mentioned clocks. I now move
down the list to articles of jewellery. On
articles of all kinds of goods made from
ivory, 10 per cent. These are included in
Schedule I of the act, which is not amended
by this bill.
Schedule II refers to cigarettes and manufactured tobacco. On each five cigarettes or
fraction of five cigarettes contained in any
package, you pay 2 cents in addition to your
sales tax. On manufactured tobacco, including snuff, but not including cigars and
cigarettes, there is an excise tax of 80 cents
per lb. So I think we have it clear that over
and above the 10 per cent sales tax on the
articles I have mentioned, you pay this additional tax, which is considerable.
Honourable senators, coming now to the
bill before us, all I can say is that while the
Government was making some reductions it
could have gone a little farther without costing the treasury a great deal of money. In
fact, I think if the Government had reduced
the sales tax on certain articles of household
equipment which particularly affect the
ordinary householder-the young couple getting married and setting up a home-it would
have been in the interests of our country,
by encouraging our young people to take the
leap and get married. It may be argued that
the tax on building materials is reduced and
that young people will benefit from that reduction. That is true, but I feel that a
municipality is much better able to pay sales

tax on articles it purchases than the young
householder is able to pay the tax on household equipment.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Not according to the
honourable senator from Toronto-Spadina
(Hon. Mr. Croll).
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Just a moment. The
honourable senator from Toronto-Spadina
will agree that the municipality is much
better able to pay the sales tax on the goods
which it buys, than the young married couple
is able to pay a tax on a refrigerator, for
instance. Why has the sales tax been left
on refrigerators, electric stoves, washing
machines, electric irons and toasters? Every
young couple in Canada that sets up housekeeping needs to buy all these goods.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: In Saskatchewan they
get them as wedding presents.
Hon. Mr.
province.

Hayden:

That

is a

wealthy

Hon. Mr. Macdonald: The Government does
not give young couples refrigerators and
electric stoves.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: No; I mean they are
given by friends.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I have no doubt there
are many generous persons in Saskatchewan
who make gifts of this kind, as also in
Ontario, and in many places throughout the
country, but there are thousands of young
people setting up homes each year in Canada
who do not receive as wedding gifts the
goods I have mentioned, and have to buy
them themselves. Why should not the Government be generous and go all the way in
removing the tax on these articles? Honourable senators, I submit that the sales tax
has been taken off many goods on which it
could have been left. But I think the Government could have given a little encouragement to young people, who have a very hard
time establishing themselves these days.
Another part of the bill which interested
me greatly was the section of Schedule III
entitled "Charitable, Health etc.". There is
no sales tax on cortisone, insulin and radium;
and there is no sales tax on liver extract
for use exclusively in the treatment of
anaemia. I am in accord with that. There
is also no sales tax on vaccine for use in the
prevention of poliomyelitis, and material for
use exclusively in the manufacture thereof.
Are honourable senators not surprised to
learn that there is a sales tax on vaccine
which is used in connection with smallpox,
diphtheria and whooping cough? I understand
that nowadays practically all children are
vaccinated against all three. When there is no

AUGUST

sales tax on vaccine used in connection with
polio, why is there a tax on vaccine used
for any other purpose? It is hard for me to
understand.
Then there are all these other household
drugs which are found in every medicine
chest in every home, such as iodine, band
aids, peroxide, castor oil, and other vegetable
and mineral oils. And what is the reason
for leaving the sales tax on penicillin, and on
iodine? I do not know. I cannot understand
why the Government, in taking the sales
tax off so many things, overlooked the more
essential articles of daily life, on which the
tax must continue to be paid.
Hon. Salier A. Hayden: Honourable senators, I am not going to delay consideration
of this bill very long. My friend has done
an excellent job in pointing out that this
is not a bill designed primarily to bring
joy to newlyweds, and I do not propose
to add anything to that except to say that
some additional building materials are
exempt, and that since newlyweds must find
a place to live, their home will possibly cost
a little less because the sales tax is not
applicable to some of these building materials.
The bill is remedial. For that, I suppose, we
should bow in reverence and thank the
authorities who have seen fit to give this
further little measure of relief, and hope that
the good work will be continued.
The part of the bill that caused me to rise
and speak is section 7. It may be that I
see something sinister when I find the words
"prima facie proof" occurring. From time
to time, as bills have come to us over a
number of years in the past, the words
"prima facie proof" have appeared, and when
we have been alert and caught it we have
changed it to read "prima facie evidence".
Now, there is a great difference between
"prima facie proof" and "prima facie evidence". To me "prima facie proof" is a contradiction in terms, but what they have
provided here is that where there is a prosecution of some person for an offence under
this statute the production of the return
purporting to be signed by him or on his
behalf shall be prima facie proof of the fact
of signature by him or by somebody on his
behalf. Well, when you say prima facie proof,
as far as I am concerned you have tied the
hands of the magistrate or the judge-he
can exercise no discretion in relation to that
return, he must accept that return and whatever appears on it as being prima facie proof.
Prima facie evidence is something entirely
different. The return is produced in court
and the magistrate has some discretion in
the matter: he may examine the return, he
may examine other evidence adduced by the

18, 1958

Crown and he may conclude that a prima
facie case has not been made out. In my
submission, proof of the return, establishment
of the fact that it was signed by or on behalf
of the person charged, is the important factor
in the case. The production of the return
should not give to the Crown any more than
a prima facie case, as we call it, and therefore you must say it is prima facie evidence,
not prima facie proof. As far as I am concerned I would be prepared to say that the
bill would not need to be referred to committee were it not for this rather unusual
wording. This provision in section 7 we have
argued on other occasions and we have been
told by some of the people in the Department of Justice that prima facie proof and
prima facie evidence mean the same thing.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: What did we do with
those other bills?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: In some of them, as I
said in opening, where we were alert enough
at the time we changed it. There may be
one or two that we did not catch, but I do
not know. But we changed some of them
and I remember, when considering one of
them, being told by Department of Justice
officials that we should not do anything with
it as both expressions mean the same thing.
So the obvious answer is, why change prima
facie evidence to read prima facie proof and
go through the procedure of an amendment
if they both amount to the same thing? In
my view they do not mean the same thing
and I think the proper thing to do is to
retain the discretion on the part of the
magistrate and give to the Crown the opportunity of adducing more evidence. Why not
be satisfied with the term prima facie
evidence?
Hon. Mr. Thorvaldson: Having great regard
for the legal prowess of the honourable senator from Toronto (Hon. Mr. Hayden), perhaps
I should not dare to disagree with what he
has said in regard to this particular phrase.
It was pointed out to me a few moments ago,
and my thinking at the time was merely
that the phrase "prima facie evidence" reads
much better, but on looking at it closely I
must say that I cannot agree with the view
that my honourable friend has in regard to it.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: That is what makes lawsuits.
Hon. Mr. Thorvaldson: Yes, that is right.
The governing words are "prima facie", and
the moment that these words come before a
magistrate or a judge, whether in the phrase
"prima facie evidence" or "prima facie
proof" he knows that it is rebuttable. As
we know, the prosecution must begin with
something, and it begins with the report

SENATE
filed by the taxpayer. For the life of me
I cannot see the difference between "prima
facie evidence" and "prima facie proof",
because the moment I see either "evidence"
or "proof" following the words prima facie
it simply means to me it is evidence which
is rebuttable. But I will agree that I much
prefer the phrase "prima facie evidence" to
"prima facie proof" and I think it must be
just an oversight on the part of the department in using the words "prima facie proof".
Certainly, as far as I am concerned, the words
"prima facie" govern the situation and I am
not much concerned whether the word which
follows is "evidence" or "proof".
Hon. Gustave Moneite: Honourable senators, I agree with the last pronouncement
on the matter. To me "prima facie proof"
and "prima facie evidence" are the same.
Whether it is evidence prima facie or proof
prima facie, it is prima facie. That is, at
first sight it is evidence, and evidence at first
sight is evidence that can be received until
it is contradicted. It is rebuttable, as my
honourable friend said. There are two kinds
of evidence-prima facie evidence, which is
rebuttable and evidence which is not rebuttable.
But the expression "prima facie
evidence" or "prima facie proof" means it is
proof that should be received, but it can be
contradicted.

Hon. Mr. Hayden: Will my friend permit
a question?
I can understand how one
rebuts evidence, but how does one rebut
proof?
Hon. Mr. Thorvaldson: That is why I prefer
the word "evidence". But it does not make
any difference.
Hon. Mr. Moneile: To me the word
"evidence" is the same as the word "proof".
Hon. Mr. Hayden: Well, if that is so, why
not say it?
Hon. Mr. Monelie: I would say the two
words are not identical but they mean very
close to the same thing. I myself prefer the
word "evidence", but legally I do not see
the difference between it and "proof".
Hon. Mr. Croll: I am not sure which side
I am on at the moment, but there has been
a prima facie case made for referring this
bill ta committee.
Motion agreed to and bill read second time.

RETURNED SOLDIERS' INSURANCE BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. George S. White moved the second
reading of Bill C-33, to amend the Returned
Soldiers' Insurance Act.
He said: Honourable senators, this is a
bill to amend an act passed for the benefit
of the veterans of World War I. The act was

SENATE
passed in 1920. The main purpose was to
provide insurance for veterans who, on account of disabilities and other factors, would
be unable to obtain insurance from the
regular insurance companies. The act provided for a policy not exceeding $5,000. It
also had provisions as to who the beneficiaries could be under that policy. This insurance remained in force from 1920 to
1923, when eligibility ceased. It was resumed
in 1928 and ceased in 1933 so since August
1933 no new policies have been issued under
this act. The premiums charged were on a
non-participating basis, and all the premiums
collected form part of the Consolidated Revenue Fund.
During the period this act has been in
force there were issued 48,319 policies for a
total of $109,299,500. The average amount of
each policy was approximately $2,000. On the
30th June this year the policies in force
were 10,570, with a face value of approximately $22,363,060.01.

Clause 2 of the bill substitutes the word
"contingent" for "alternative" in the description of the secondary class of beneficiaries. As
honourable members may know, the primary
class of beneficiaries consists of the spouse
and children of the insured. So long as any
member of that class survives the insured,
the proceeds will be paid within that class
as designated. The secondary class consists
of the insured's parents, brothers and sisters,
grandchildren, et cetera. The description of
this class as "alternative" beneficiaries has
proven to be confusing to policyholders, as
they have tended to look on it as describing
an alternative member of the class of primary
beneficiaries. For example, a policyholder
who wished to name his wife as the primary
beneficiary if she survived him and, otherwise, desired the proceeds to be paid to his
son, might designate his son as an alternative

AUGUST 19, 1958
The proviso I mentioned has reference to
policies issued prior to the amendment of
June 1922. Up to that time, the act authorized
contracts ta include a provision that if a
pension were awarded on the insured's death
the premiums and interest would be refunded
in lieu of the insurance money. There was
no restriction in the amount of such accumulation. In some instances, on such policies,
the premiums and interest amount to more
than the face amount. The rights of these
policyholders will be protected and the beneficiaries will continue to receive the total
accumulation as provided by their contracts.
I might mention, honourable senators, that
this bill was referred to the Standing Committee on Veteran Affairs in the other house,
at which the Canadian Legion was represented and approved the bill, as did the
committee.
Hon. W. Ross Macdonald: Honourable senators, I am very much interested in this bill
and I am exceedingly grateful to the Government of 1920 for bringing in this act, for at
that time I was one of many thousands who
were not considered good insurance risks.
None of the life insurance companies would
take me as a risk because in their eyes I
was not supposed to live long. Fortunately,
however, because of the sheltered life I have
lived since 1920 I am in very good health
now and I would have been a good risk for
the insurance companies.
Hon. Mr. Bruni: That was before you came
into the Senate.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I am one of the
48,319 original policy holders who took out
policies under the provision of this bill, and
I know of many others who served during
World War I who could not have obtained
insurance at that time, had it not been for
this bill. The bill has served an excellent
purpose, and it will continue to serve a better
purpose when amended in accordance with
the explanation given by the honourable senator who introduced it. All I have to say
personally is that it will be many a long
year before my estate gets the benefit of this
policy which I hold.
Motion agreed to and bill read second time.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators,
when shall this bill be read the third time?
Hon. Mr. White: Next sitting.
VETERANS INSURANCE BILL
SECOND

READING

Hon. George S. White moved the second
reading of Bill C-34, to amend the Veterans
Insurance Act.

He said: Honourable senators, this bill is
a counterpart of the previous bill, and it
provides for insurance for veterans of World
War II. The act came into effect in 1944, and
the first insurance policies under it were
issued in the following year. Eligibility under
this act extended to all veterans and certain
other persons. The same provisions as were
in the Returned Soldiers' Insurance Act applied to veterans who were unable to get
insurance under this act on account of low
categories and certain disabilities. The premiums were on a non-participating basis, and
as with the other act all premiums are paid
into the Consolidated Revenue Fund. The
largest amount is $10,000, as opposed to
$5,000 under the other bill. Up to June 30
of this year 42,508 policies have been issued,
with a face value of $133,870,000. Of these
policies, on June 30 of this year there were
in effect 28,523 policies with a face value of
$86,243,000.
Clause 1: As honourable senators are aware,
eligibility to contract for veterans insurance
has terminated for a great many veterans who
saw service during World War II, and eligibility in most other cases expired on December 31, 1954 for certain other groups. Eligibility for members of the regular forces who
continued to serve after the war was intended
to terminate on December 31, 1954, but due
to a change in the meaning of "active service" which was extended in 1950 to include
service in the regular forces, such members
became eligible to contract for this insurance
during a period of ten years following their
release from the regular forces. Clause 1 of
this bill as originally presented provided a
firm cut-off date for such members of the
forces who saw service during the war. The
cut-off date proposed was September 30, 1962.
When this bill was discussed in the House of
Commons Standing Committee on Veterans
Affairs the committee came to the conclusion
that it would be advisable to extend the period
of eligibility to September 30, 1962 to all
veterans of World War II and to the special
groups to which I have referred. The Veterans Committee in the other place made this
recommendation to the Government, and the
Government gave it due consideration, and as
a result clause 1 of the bill now extends
eligibility under this act until September 30,
1962, to the following groups:
1. Veterans.
2. Widows and widowers of persons who died on
service during the war.
3. Widows and widowers of veterans who had
not contracted for this insurance.
4. Members of the regular forces who saw service
during the war and continued to serve.
5. Members of the women's Royal Naval Services
and the South African Military Nursing Service.
6. Fire fighters.
7. Special operators.
8. Auxiliary services supervisors.

9. Merchant seamen who received or were eligible

war.

respect to the interpretation of section 3, as
the draftmanship somewhat puzzles me.
Section 3(1) provides that section 10 of
the act is repealed.
Then subsection 2 says, "This section", and
I presume it means section 3 of this bill. It
does not refer to section 10, which bas already
been repealed by subsection 1 of section 3,
and I am puzzled as to what exactly will be
the effect of section 3(2) after section 10 has
been repealed. May I ask the honourable
senator from Hastings-Frontenac (Hon. Mr.
White) to explain it?
Hon. Mr. White: Honourable senators, I do
not know whether I can explain it or not. I
should have mentioned that this bill, which
also was referred to the Committee on veterans Affairs of the House of Commons, at
which the Canadian Legion was represented,
received their approval and approval of the
committee. I am afraid, however, that I cannot answer the honourable senator's question
offhand.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Probably the third
reading of the bill could be put over until
tomorrow, so as to enable the sponsor of the
bill to get some information on the clause.
Hon. Mr. White: I will get the information
and give it to the honourable senator on
third reading.
Hon. Mr. Leonard: Thank you very much.
Motion agreed to and bill read second time.

Clause 2 of the bill contains a provision
similar to that contained in Bill C-33 amending the Returned Soldiers' Insurance Act,
which grants the minister discretion to
authorize the payment of an additional $1,000
of policy proceeds in lieu of his present discretion, which is limited to amounts under
$500.
Clause 3 repeals section 10 of the Veterans
Insurance Act. Following the reasoning employed in the designing of the Returned
Soldiers' Insurance Bill, a similar provision
with respect to the limitation of proceeds in
the event of the award of a pension under
the Pension Act on the insured's death was
incorporated in this act. The basis of the
calculation of the amount differs from that
under the Returned Soldiers' Insurance Act,
in that the amount of insurance above $500
is paid, broadly, in proportion to the part of
the premium-paying term of the policy that
has elapsed; for example, if a policyholder
with a $5,000 contract on the 20-payment life
basis dies after 12 years and a pension is
awarded, the amount payable to his widow,
the beneficiary, would be $500 plus about
12/20ths of $4,500. If it had been a 10payment life policy it would have been paid
in full because the premium term had exThe Hon. the Speaker: When shall this

AUGUST 19, 1958
In addition, pension is continued by the
Canadian Pension Commission at the rate of
$40 per month up to the 21st birthday. The
student is required to be pursuing a course
of full-time instruction and limited to four
academie years or 36 months, whichever is
the lesser. The student is required to commence the course within 15 months after matriculation. The act does not permit continuation of allowance or fees where the student
fails in more than one supplementary examination. However, he is granted a deferment of one year while he is continuing at
his own expense a repeated year. The payment of allowances and fees is not continued
beyond the twenty-fifth birthday, except to
enable the student to complete the academic
year in which he attains that age.
As of June 1958, 1125 children have been
approved for training under this legislation,
and it is expected that in the very near future this number will increase from 25 per
cent to 33 per cent.
The total cost under this act to date is
$885,939; and for the last fiscal year, from
April 1, 1957 to March 31, 1958 the cost was
$150,000.
It may be of interest to honourable senators to know that 552 boys and 573 girls
took advantage of this training. Out of
the boys who took training there were
170 engineers, 75 in business administration,
36 lawyers, 48 scientists, 70 teachers, 28
technicians, and so on. Of the girls who
took training there were 10 in business
administration, 10 in commercial artists,
26 dietitians, 14 journalists, 241 nurses, 172
teachers, and so on. In all there were 28
different courses taken by these children.
The purpose of the amendment in clause
1(v) of the bill is to extend eligibility to
a child whose parents died after the child's
21st but before his 25th birthday. An allowance and cost of education can only be paid
where a student is or has been receiving
pension in respect of the death of a parent.
Consequently, these payments may commence
after the student reaches age 21 only where
the parent died before the student reached
age 21 and a pension was paid on behalf of
that child. This conforms with the policy
that, if a child whose father was living had
not commenced higher education before age
21, such education would not be one of the
things that the child was denied because of
the service-connected death of the father.
However, some cases have come to light
where the child whose father was living
actually did commence higher education
before age 21, but when the father died
subsequently the family circumstances were
such that he had to discontinue his education

or to continue it under conditions of hardship to the family. As the purpose of the
act is to ensure that children will not be
deprived of higher education because of their
father's death as a result of service, there
appears to be some discrimination against
this group. There is no reason why a child
should not benefit solely because his father
died after he, the son, reached 21, while a
child next door enjoys the benefit because
his father died when he, the son, was 20.
Provided other conditions are met, the two
should have the same opportunity for
education.
Some restrictions should, nevertheless, be
imposed 'to ensure that eligibility is extended
only in those cases where the parent's death
would be the sole cause of the interruption
of the child's education. Otherwise, there
would be no relationship between the serviceconnected death of the father and the granting of the benefit. These restrictions are set
out in clause 3 of the bill.
Clause 1 (vi). The purpose of this amendment is to extend eligibility to a child whose
pension is reduced because of compensation
from another source.
Sections 20, 21 and 22 of the Pension Act
require the commission, in determining the
amount of pension to be awarded, to take
into consideration the amount of compensation paid under a Workmen's Compensation
Act or the amount of damages paid by a
person legally liable. For this reason, it
sometimes happens that pension in respect
of a child is paid at a rate lower than that
specified in schedule B to the Pension Act, or
even not paid at all. Where no pension is
paid, it may not be possible to conclude
definitely that the judgment by the board
or by the court contemplated full coverage
of the costs of education; where the commission awards some pension, such costs are
not covered.
Clause 1 (vii). The purpose of this amendment is to extend eligibility to a child in
respect of whom compassionate pension is
granted under section 25 of the Pension Act.
There are some cases where a compassionate
award of pension is made in favour of
children who are in reality "children of
war dead". In this type of case, it can be
argued that the children have a right to
educational benefits upon the father's death.
It is proposed that eligibility be accorded
to a child where (1) the cause of the parent's
death has been ruled by the Pension Commission to have been incurred on or attributable to war service or to service in Korea;
and (2), pension to or on behalf of the child
has been awarded by the commission under
section 25 of the Pension Act.
Clause 2. The purpose of this amendment
is to permit the allowance to be fixed at

SENATE
$60 a month to a child who has attained his
21st birthday but has not reached his 25th.
When a child is receiving education and
reaches age 21, pension is discontinued and
his income is reduced by $40 a month if he
is a first child, by $30 a month if a second
child, and by $24 a month if a subsequent
child. This is based on the orphan rates for
children. Thus there exists a certain anomaly
under the act, in that a student who has been
accepted for higher education at age 19
receives a monthly allowance of $25 a month
and also a pension of $40, if he is a first
child, until he reaches age 21. After that his
income is reduced to $25 a month although
he continues the same studies under the
same conditions. If we are to allow the
student to complete his course successfully
and safeguard our original investment, it
seems that we should not place him in an
unfavourable position just because he bas
reached age 21. The $60 a month suggested
is the same amount that was paid to a single
veteran training under the Rehabilitation
Act, and represents an average between
the $65 paid to a first child before age 21
and the $55 paid to a second child.
Clause 3. This clause sets forth the restrictions, to which I referred in discussing clause 1,
applicable to the over 21 age group. This
amendment permits payment of allowance and
costs for a student whose parent's death was
service-connected and occurred after the
student had reached age 21 but prior to his
25th birthday; provided that the student (a)
had commenced higher education before
reaching age 21; (b) has pursued such education without interruption until the death of
the veteran parent; and (c) applies for assistance under the act to commence not later
than the beginning of the next academic
year following the death of the veteran
parent, subject to the proviso that the minister may permit extension of the commencement date where he feels that circumstances
so warrant.
Honourable senators, this bill also was
referred to the Veterans Affairs Committee
of the other place, at which members of the
Canadian Legion were present. Not only the
members of the Legion but all members of
the committee warmly commended the extensions provided by this bill.
Hon. W. Ross Macdonald: Honourable senators, I am sure this bill will not meet with
any objection from this house. Its passage
will necessitate certain additional expenditures, but I think we are all in accord with
it for this purpose. Did I understand the
honourable senator who introduced the bill to
say that the cost to date was $885,935?
Hon. Mr. White: That is correct.

Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Is that the cumulative
cost?
Hon. Mr. White: That is the total cost to
date. Last year the cost was approximately
$150,000.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: This year the cost will
be greater, and it will increase from time to
time as years go by. But I do not think
anyone would take exception to the bill on
that point.
The sponsor of the bill stated that members of the Legion were present at the committee meeting of the other house, and that
they were pleased with the improvements
contained in the bill. But he did not state
that the Legion felt the provisions should go
farther.
Hon. Mr. White: I might point out to the
honourable Leader of the Opposition (Hon.
Mr. Macdonald), who has had extensive
experience in appearing before the Legion,
that it always wants such legislation to go
a little further than it goes.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I would not agree
that the Legion always wants more than it
gets. It has had certain aims, and most of
them have over the years been achieved
through the persistency of its membcrs and
by reason of the assistance of sympathetic
members of the other house, including the
honourable senator who sponsored the bill,
who sat on committees from time to time
and saw the justice of the claims made by
the Legion. The veterans feel they are
entitled to certain considerations, they ask
for them, and when they get them they are
satisfied; but until they do get them they
persist in appearing before committees for
that purpose, as they have the right to do.
In this instance the Legion wanted clause
1(vii) extended to include all children who
are in receipt of a compassionate pension
under section 25.
But the Government,
which must take the responsibility in the
matter, has not seen its way clear up to the
present time to grant that request. The
sponsor of the bill can hardly say the committee of the other house did not grant it;
I think if the Government had shown any
desire to agree to the request of the Legion
the committee would have gone along with
it.
I refer next to the new section 4(l)(b),
which is in clause 2 of the bill. In this
respect also the Legion did not feel the provision went far enough. It felt that the
provision would cause a discrepancy in the
case of more than one child by reason of the
scaled payments under the Pension Act. The
Legion recommended that the amount should
be increased, but again the Government has

AUGUST 19, 1958
not seen its way clear to meet that request.
Perhaps I should read the last few words of
paragraph (b):
-but the total period for which an allowance
may be paid to or in respect of a student under
this act shall not exceed four academic years or
36 months, whichever is the lesser.

I do not know whether that means 36 months
of continued education, or 36 months in the
aggregate.
Hon. Mr. White: Thirty-six months in the
aggregate.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Is that clear in the
clause?
Hon. Mr. McDonald: That would be four
college years.
Hon. Mr. White: It would be four continuous years, or 36 months, whichever is
the lesser. It could not be more than four
college years; it is four academic years or
36 academic months, whichever is the lesser.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I see. And the 36
months would not have to be continuous
months.
Hon. Mr. White: It could be continuous,
in cases where there were classes, or something like that. But in the case of a boy going
to university, to study law, or to be an engineer, it certainly would not be continuous;
it would be the academic year.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Then, again, the Legion takes exception to the schedule. It requests the adding of those children pensioned
under clause 26, subsection 7 of the Pension
Act, which provides pensions for children of
disability pensioners, if the pension had been
paid at the rate of 50 per cent or more,
regardless of the cause of death. But here
again, the Government has not seen fit to meet
the wishes of the Legion. I point this out
simply to emphasize the fact that, although
the Legion is pleased with the improvements
which are made in this bill, the measure does
not meet all its requests, and doubtless it
will come back next year, and doubtless we
shall have another bill, similar to this one,
at the next session of Parliament.
Motion agreed to and bill read second time.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, when shall this bill be read the third
time?
Hon. Mr. White: Next sitting.
NATIONAL CAPITAL BILL
FIRST READING

Hon. Lionel Choquette moved the second
reading of Bill C-48, respecting the development and Improvement of the National Capital Region.

He said: Honourable senators, the purpose
of this bill is to revise the Federal District
Commission Act to enable the commission to
discharge more effectively its duties in the
preparation of plans for, and assistance in,
the development and improvement of the
National Capital Region. For this purpose
the names of the act and of the commission
have been changed and the commission's organization, powers and financing have been
substantially revised. The joint Parliamentary
committee appointed in 1956 to review and
report upon the progress and programs of the
Federal District Commission recommended
that the Federal District Commission Act be
revised, and a number of the provisions of
this bill implement recommendations of the
committee.
The references hereafter are to be corresponding provisions of the Federal District
Commission Act.
Such are the explanatory notes in the
bill.
It will be recalled that in 1956 a joint
committee of the Senate and of the other
place made certain recommendations regarding the enlargement and improvement of the
National Capital District. The bill before you,
respecting the development and improvement of the National Capital Region, has been
prepared largely in the light of these recommendations. As recommended by the committee, the names "National Capital Act" and
"National Capital Commission" have been
substituted for "Federal District Commission
Act" and "Federal District Commission".
Provision has been made for increasing the
size of the present National Capital District.
The National Capital Region referred to in
the bill is approximately double the size of
the National Capital District.
An important feature of the new bill is
the power it grants to the National Capital
Commission to deal with land it requires to
carry out its objects and purposes. Among
other things, the commission is empowered
to acquire, hold, administer or develop property, including the acquisition and holding
of property which it does not require for its
immediate needs. This is particularly important in the case of lands within the green
belt which the commission may acquire and
hold to ensure the orderly development of
this area. As most honourable senators know,
it may be necessary for the commission at
times to acquire more property than is really
required for certain purposes; and the commission, according to this bill, will be
empowered to do so. Later on the commission may make sure that the portion which is
not required for its purposes be not subdivided into small lots that could be sold.
The commission can decide to hold that excess

SENATE

land or it can lease it back to the former
owner, or resell that portion to the former
owner, and therefore prevent the risk of the
excess land being subdivided into smaller lots.
The bill continues the powers of the present
commission regarding the construction, maintenance and improvement of facilities such as
highways, parkways, approaches to railways,
and the like, and it contains several clauses

of an administrative and routine nature which
will enable the commission to carry out its
tasks more effectively and efficiently.
Honourable senators, I do not know how
many of you followed the debate in the
other place, recorded in the Commons
Hansard, but this measure has been accepted
almost unanimously by all parties. It is, as
I believe honourable senators will agree, of a
non-partisan and non-controversial character.
The Leader of the Opposition in the House
of Commons eulogized the bill and was very
much in favour of it; so was the representative of the third party in that house.
The act which the bill now submitted to
you will repeal, and for which this bill will be
substituted, is the Federal District Commission Act of 1926. The bill upon which the
present bill was founded was introduced by
Mr. St. Laurent on April 8, 1957, as Bill 417,
but was not proceeded with at that time.
A general election was held. Now the present
Government is taking the action recommended by the joint parliamentary committee. Yesterday the Prime Minister made
a declaration, which was reported in one of
our local newspapers with this headline:

Goal For Ottawa Develop-

certain excerpts

from

this

The Prime Minister told the Commons today that
lie would like to see such progress made in the
development of Ottawa as the National Capital that
the major objectives would have been achieved in
nine years when the 100th year of Confederation
will be celebrated.
Opposition Leader Pearson immediately promised
support of the legislation and said Government
buildings in the National Capital must be worthy
of the National Capital PlanMr. Pearson said this emphasis on aesthetic
value must be applied on both sides of the interprovincial boundary.

Honourable senators will realize that in
order to create the National Capital Region,
which will take in Ottawa and Hull and
parts of Nepean and Gloucester townships,
close co-operation will be required between
the Government of Canada, the provincial
Governments of Ontario and Quebec and the
municipal Governments of Ottawa and Hull.
Everyone hopes that this co-operation will
be attained soon.
The question of an interprovincial bridge
is a matter of urgency. Another question of

great importance involves that beautiful
river, the Ottawa River, which bas been
polluted in recent years. Not long ago I
heard a talk given by a well-known chemist
on this question. His theory, based on an
analysis of the water, was that if it were
not for the sewage disposal system the Ottawa
River, like any other body of running water,
such as a spring-fed mountain lake, could
purify itself within five days no matter what
else was put into it. Pollution of the Ottawa
River is one of the most serious problems
this commission will be faced with. Other
urgent problems involve construction of an
interprovincial bridge and preservation of
old buildings, old monuments, within this
area. The hope has been expressed by
speakers in other places, and it is my hope
too, that there will be no repetition of such
an act as the demolition of a monument like
the old Supreme Court of Canada Building,
where many of our Prime Ministers had
pleaded important cases and where most of
the jurisprudence of this country originated.
There should be no repetition of that kind
of thing.
I arm sure honourable senators will agree
this is a non-partisan and non-controversial
bill and that it should pass in this bouse as
easily as it passed in the other place.
Hon. John J. Connolly (Ottawa West:
Honourable senators, as a member of the
joint committee which considered the problems of the Federal District Commission in
1956, I would like to make a few comments
about the measure now before us.
At the outset may I say I was most pleased
indeed that the honourable gentleman from
Ottawa East (Hon. Mr. Choquette) was chosen
to sponsor this bill. I would venture to say
that he would know Ottawa and its environments, its geography and conditions, as well
as anybody in Parliament, for be was born
and raised in this city and his whole career
has been developed here. He has made an
excellent presentation of a bill which he has
described as non-controversial but which still
requires some consideration by both bouses
of Parliament.
The bill itself does not tell the entire story.
A good deal of it is told in the report made
by the joint committee of Parliament that
sat in 1956 and which was reproduced in our
Hansard and Minutes of the Proceedings on
August 1 of that year. That report indicated
the committee sat on some 32 occasions. I
should like to say in passing that the committee members from the other place were
pretty busy in the closing days of the session
dealing with problems in their own house,
and it was the Senate members of the committee who contributed perhaps most of the

AUGUST 19. 1958
work. It was they who, for the most part,
listened to and appraised the evidence and
framed the report.
In addition to sitting some 32 times-and
some of the sessions were long ones-the
committee under the guidance of officials of
the Federal District Commission visited some
of the properties over which the commission
has control. Prior to the committee sessions
in 1956 there had been no parliamentary
review of the affairs of the F.D.C. since 1944,
a 12-year lapse. I would hope, and indeed
the committee so recommended, that there
might be a more frequent parliamentary review of F.D.C. activities.
The most significant event between the
parliamentary studies of 1944 and 1956 was
the presentation to the Government of the
completed National Capital Plan, which had
been prepared under the direction of Mr.
Jacques Greber. If I remember correctly, Mr.
Greber was not in Ottawa during the sittings
of the committee, but he was here shortly
afterwards and many of the committee members then had an opportunity of talking with
him about the National Capital Plan. I would
like to see him return some day when a
parliamentary committee is sitting, because
the enthusiasm he shows for this plan and
the convincing way in which he discusses the
prospects and possibilities of creating a magnificent national capital, is something every
parliamentarian should hear.
Honourable senators, there are some things
in the report I think might well be reflected
in our records today. In referring to the
National Capital Plan the report says:
We believe when it is implemented it will be a
monument around which and within which the
historical and cultural interests and activities of
our people can be developed.

It is conceived as something of which all
Canadians can be proud, and I think honourable senators, most of whom have spent
all of the summer months in Ottawa this
yearHon. Mr. Croll: Not by choice.
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): Not by
choice, it is true, and perhaps not by choice
even of those whose homes are in Ottawa;
but I think all parliamentarians will realize
what a focal point, what a mecca, this very
Hill, with its magnificent location, is becoming
for Canadians-I hope more for Canadians
than for people of other countries. Perhaps
that alone begins to justify in the mind of
parliamentarians the importance of developing this plan in the interest of all Canada.
Honourable senators, the development and
completion of this plan-perhaps it never
will be really completed-the development
of this plan is not going to be a cheap operation; it is going to be expensive in terms

of dollars, and for that reason it must be
thought of with the national interest, rather
than the local municipal interest. primarily
in mind. In other words, the improvements
which are made under the National Capital
Plan are not designed for Ottawa as a
municipality, they are designed for Ottawa as
a great national capital.
The honourable gentleman who explained
the bill said something about the need of
co-operation between various levels of
Government. That is one of the problems
that confronted the members of the committee, and particularly the lawyers, of
course, who were very conscious of it,
because in the proposed national capital
area, as it is described, you have two provincial interests as well as the federal interest, and you have some eight or nine
municipal interests. You have two cities, and
you have a set of rural municipalities on
both sides of the interprovincial border.
To try to work out a scheme which is not
going to infringe upon the rights and the
prerogatives of these various governmental
levels is bound to present problems. As the
committee learned, each province has what
is known as a Planning 'Act, if I may describe
it in a general way. Under these Planning
Acts it is possible to arrange for certain types
of orderly development within a given area,
as described in an order made under the
act. Any plan which might be imposed upon
an area as a result of the operations and
provisions of a Planning Act can, of course,
interfere with a general plan like the National
It was made very clear
Capital Plan.
to members of the committee, however, that
the National Capital Plan is not something
that is to be imposed regardless of the
provincial rights and responsibilities and
regardless of the municipal rights and responsibilities. Therefore, in order to work
out the idea of a national plan, thought has
to be given to the provincial position and
to the municipal position as well.
In the report some six items were singled
out for special treatment, and I think it was
the intention of the members of the committee to try to set these up in terms of
importance. The first was the problem of
pollution in the Ottawa River, to which my
honourable friend bas already referred. I do
not propose to discuss that at any length. The
senior senator from Ottawa (Hon. Mr. Lambert) has already brought to the attention of
the Senate on a number of occasions the importance of that problem and the difficulty
of dealing with it. When the committee sat
we had some very excellent evidence and
good advice given by Dr. A. E. Berry,
Director of Sanitary Engineering, of the
Ontario Department of Health. Just about

SENATE
that time the Quebec Legislature also passed
an act called an "Act Respecting the Pollution of Water". The difficulty of solving the
pollution problem in the Ottawa River is not
one which can be solved by the two large
municipalities alone, or by one of them.
There are a good many municipalities, upstream and downstream, which have considerable responsibility in this. It should be
remembered, too, that while the toxic pollution does come from sewage, there is a good
deal of industrial pollution which will
perhaps present a problem of a different
character and of different magnitude, but
which is still a real problem to the authorities
which finally have to deal with the pollution
problem. I hope the City of Ottawa can take
a lead, particularly in the construction of
the sewage disposal plant and, before that,
in the provision of the connector sewers
which are so essential to that, and are,
incidentally, so very expensive.
The second point of interest was the
establishment of the Queensway. I do not
think I want to discuss that at any length,
except to say that it seems to be well on
the way now and that, as the committee
had hoped, provision has been made that it
shall be helped from the act with reference
to the establishment of the Trans-Canada
highway.
The problem of the removal of railway
facilities from which the downtown area of
Ottawa was given serious consideration by
the committee, and the feeling was that as
soon as possible the downtown railway facilities should be eliminated. I realize that
this would cause a certain amount of inconvenience to travellers by train, and
perhaps even to parliamentary travellers by
train. It would mean perhaps a twenty
minute taxi drive, instead of just crossing
the street; but, after all, people are accustomed nowadays to going to the outskirts
of cities when they arrive by plane, and I
think in time perhaps the inconvenience will
be accepted and the downtown railway
facilities can be removed to the place where
in the National Capital Plan they best fit in.
The question of the bridge between Ottawa
and Hull was also of some importance in the
minds of the people who sat on the committee, and it was recommended that a
new bridge be built as soon as possible.
The question of the Green Belt was a
very thorny problem, and I am very pleased
indeed to see that the problem bas now been
solved. It was thought that perhaps that huge
expenditure which is now to be undertaken
by the Government to acquire the Green
Belt might have been avoided if some action
could be taken under the Planning Act,
particularly of the province of Ontario, which

might give the same kind of protection without the huge expenditure required by expropriation of the Green Belt area. However,
apparently that avenue has been explored
without avail, and the step of expropriating
the Green Belt area must now proceed.
Lastly, I corne to the sixth item, a major
item of the report, and the last one with
which I shall deal, that is, the development
of the Gatineau Park. The honourable senator from Medicine Hat (Hon. Mr. Gershaw)
spoke about this matter when he addressed
himself to the affairs of the Federal District
Commission, during the Address in Reply to
the Speech from the Throne.
There has been a good deal of comment
both for and against the establishment of
Gatineau Park which is not, strictly speaking, a part of the national capital, of Ottawa
proper. 'But I do think with that magnificent
territory to the north of the Ottawa River
and to the north of this Hill so readily accessible it is rather appropriate that, looking
to thp ong range view at the future of this
country and at the future of this national
capital, some effort should be made to preserve the natural beauty of that area for
future generations and, indeed, for the availability of the present generation. One or two
years ago I was present when the then
Prime Minister, the Right Honourable Mr. St.
Laurent, presided at a function opening what
is now known as the Fortune Lake Parkway.
I would hope that every honourable senator
would some day be able to go to the top of
Fortune Lake Parkway and see the magnificent view there from the escarpment overlooking the Ottawa River. The view obtained
from that height extends almost 75 miles in
every direction from the lookout over the
river. It is typical of central Canada scenery.
In time the roadway will continue along
the escarpment, I hope, for a distance of
some 15 to 17 miles as far as a place called
Taylor Lake, and I think it will be one of
the most spectacular drives in eastern
Canada.
I do not want to get into a controversy
with the people from Nova Scotia, who will
talk of the Cabot Trail, nor with people from
western Canada, who will speak about the
Rockies, but I speak now of the scenery in
central Canada, and I think that the development of that drive along the escarpment
over the Ottawa River will be comparable to
anything in Canada or to anything the
Americans have in, let us say, their drive
over the Blue Ridge Mountains outside of
Washington. In addition to that, it is a very
historic spot, and as Mr. St. Laurent pointed
out that day, perhaps from the very vantage
point on which we were all standing and

AUGUST 19, 1958
looking at this magnificent scene in the beautiful colours of October, Champlain himself,
as he went up the Ottawa, might have stood
on those heights to survey the area he was
then exploring.
Honourable senators, as one who, like the
honourable gentleman from Ottawa East
(Hon. Mr. Choquette), was born here and
has been interested for many years in the
development of this great vision of a great
national capital, I think more interest should
be taken in this great plan by representatives
of the people froin all parts of Canada. If
they do so, the more successful, the more
fruitful will be the work done by the Federal
District Commission. The people who work
there are dedicated people, most interested
in the development of the plan as laid down
by Mr. Greber and as he has progressed with
it under the encouragement of successive
Prime Ministers. I do hope that the plan
will continue to be developed, not in the
interest of this locality alone but in the
interest of all Canadians.
Hon. Norman P. Lambert: Honourable
senators, I should like to congratulate my
colleague from Ottawa East (Hon. Mr. Choquette) upon the very interesting presentation
he made of this bill and to say to him that
some 14 years ago, upon the occasion of the
second revision of this act, I had the privilege
of saying something about the deliberations
of a joint committee at that time on the
things that were recommended for future
achievement. I have been interested in trying
to recall to what extent they have been
adopted, and while my honourable friend was
speaking so optimistically and enthusiastically
of the future of this legislation I could not
help but go back to the part I played in 1944
when the then Prime Minister, the Right
Honourable Mackenzie King, with enthusiasm
and idealism for the future of this district,
expressed his outlook almost as enthusiastically as the Primè Minister did yesterday
in the other house about the years which
will elapse between now and the hundredth
anniversary of Confederation. I can say right
at the outset that I am heartily in support
of this bill and I hope all the things that are
said about it will come true much more
quickly than the things that we thought might
be achieved in 1944 have come true. I would
just like to point out that the change of
name to the National Capital Commission
and the National Capital Region in place of
the Federal District Commission and Federal
District area are significant changes, even
though I doubt they will have much effect
on the material development of this district.
The very fact that the name has been changed
57075-4-39

or is proposed to be changed suggests possibly a more conscious outlook on the capital
of Canada for the future than bas been
evident in the past.
I would like, however, as a matter of
contrast to refer to something that was said
by the late Prime Minister in 1944, as
recorded on page 2237, volume 3, of the
Commons Hansard of that year. Speaking
to a resolution which set up the joint committee of 1944 he said this:
Some day the capital of Canada might become
a federal district to be administered by a commission in a manner similar to the capital at
Washington. That district would extend far enough
to include a very large area on the other side of
the river as well as the Ottawa area. I would
like to see the day when the Ottawa river instead
of flowing along the north border of the capital
will be flowing through the heart of the city, the
Greater Ottawa that is to be, and that we shall
have a capital city which will extend as far into
the province on the other side of the Ottawa
River as it may extend in the province on this
side.

Now, the Right Honourable Mr. Diefenbaker refers to a capital city "worthy of
Canada's destiny and of the nation as a
whole", to "a city beautiful" and also to
"a concept of a capital city that was dreamt
of by successive Prime Ministers of this
country, one of whom, namely, the Right
Honourable Mackenzie King, gave to the
planning a sense of national purpose and
dedication which this bill will carry on".
As I say, when reading these references
over against the eloquence of the late Prime
Minister in 1944 I am just wondering whether
or not the trend bas changed. Has the outlook
changed in relation to the significance of this
capital centre? The other house was told
that the change of name bas been brought
about because some people were not happy
about the word "district" because it suggested
an intention to make of this area a district
similar to the District of Columbia in the
United States. If there is any truth in that
suggestion it certainly would appear that the
words of the present Prime Minister about
carrying out the vision and purposes of the
previous Prime Minister will have to wait for
another 15 years, let alone nine years, to be
given any sense of reality.
I would like to quote what was said in
1944 by the joint committee. My honourable
friend from Ottawa West (Hon. Mr. Connolly)
bas given a pretty adequate outline of what
was recommended in the joint committee
report of two years ago. I think a good deal
of the background of what was discussed then
and what was contained in that report was
deait with first of all in the report of 1944.
The reason I am emphasizing this is that I
think there is a great deal more to the progress and development of this national area

610

SEf.

than the mere passing of legislation. I think,
in short, that the vital requirement in order
to fulfil what is claimed to be the aspirations
of the people of Canada is practical ways and
means in the form of administration and
leadership to get things done. A way must
be found to overcome some of the very difficult constitutional and jurisdictional problems
that confront our authorities in approaching
this work.
I will now read two paragraphs from the
final report of the Joint Committee of the
Senate and the House of Commons appointed
in this matter. It is to be found in pamphlet
No. 8 dated August 1, 1944, at page 171.
It is not the purpose of this committee to make
definite recommendation to the Government regarding the future character of a federal district to
embrace this park area and the municipalities on
either side of the Ottawa River including the City
of Ottawa. We are of the opinion, however, that
this long-term project should be committed by the
Government to a special commission of experts for
investigation and report, involving as it would the
possession of expert professional knowledge and the
need for extended travel to study the plans and
workings of federal capital districts in other countries. From the observations made by this conmittee during its investigations, it is clear that
with the growth of Canada and the corresponding
expansion of its governmental activities, the administrative problems arising between the City of
Ottawa and the federal Government will become
more complex and more difficult of settlement than
they are now. As an indication of that prospect
we would merely stress the inevitable difficulty
that will arise in connection with the present reckless system of sewage disposal into the Ottawa
River, the both banks of which within the most
directly affected area, are the property of the
Dominion of Canada.
While the project of a federal district of the
proportions indicated must wait not only for well
matured and well-founded plans, but also for the
widespread support of a crystallized popular opinion throughout Canada, the development of Ottawa
as a national capital is proceeding apace, and must
not be held up, pending a settlement of the
larger question.
Different reports have, from time to time, been
made to the Government on the development of
this district as a national capital. The report of
the Holt Commission set up in 1913 is the most
exhaustive of them aIl. The Greber report made
in 1939 agrees in general with the main findings of
the Holt Commission. These reports have been
before the public for many years and have been
illustrated and discussed in the press and have on
the whole met with very general approval.

These words are probably just as true
today as they were in 1944. The constitutional
barriers and jurisdictional barriers are more
difficult to overcome, if I may say so, than
any physical or financial problem connected
with the administration of the federal district.
The joint committee of two years ago, which
my colleage from Ottawa West has referred
to and whose findings he has reviewed quite
comprehensively, did establish some new
projects that should be undertaken and should

r
E
AT

be followed by the Federal District Commission at as early a date as possible. The matter
to be given first priority, as has been mentioned, was that of sewage disposal affecting
the Ottawa River. The joint committee was
a good committee, with able representatives
from both houses. I remember particularly
the keen and enthusiastic interest exhibited
by the late Dr. Blair, from Lanark County,
with respect to this particular aspect of the
problem.
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa Wesi): Very
true.
Hon. Mr. Lamberi: It was naturally expected, even on this side, that a man who
was as interested in health and welfare as
Dr. Blair had given full evidence of being in
the other house, should feel that if he did
nothing else during the rest of his public
career he would like to see the Ottawa River
cleaned up and made a credit to the establishment of a federal district. Therefore, it
was without any division of opinion whatsoever that this problem of sewage was given
first priority.
Emphasis was also given to the creation of
a Green Belt, as has been explained by my
honourable friend. Among other things mentioned were parking facilities within the city
of Ottawa and the necessary changes to be
made in that connection. I believe the spectacle we have seen this summer in the way
of congestion of parking and confusion of
traffic in front of this Parliament Building
has been the most spectacular we have ever
had, and it should serve to emphasize the
problem in the minds of all members of
Parliament as indicating a condition that calls
for a remedy at the earliest possible moment.
Quite some considerable time of the committee
which sat two years ago was taken up in outlining the preparation of a place at the corner
of Rideau Street and Mackenzie Avenue
where parking facilities might be provided to
take care of parking needs both underground
and by elevating vehicles to upper floors. The
general opinion of the committee was that
this was one of the urgent problems in connection with the capital city plan, and that
something should be done to relieve the congestion and confusion of traffic which develops around Wellington and Rideau Streets,
involving the entrance to the Chateau Laurier
and the Union Station. It was felt that this
problem was second only in importance to the
difficulty in connection with river pollution,
and should be dealt with at the earliest possible moment.
I am pleased to see that the bill makes
provision for the reorganization of the Federal District Commission, and for the
appointment of a full-time general manager

AUGUS T 19, 1958
to take charge of this work. Without implying any criticism of the members of the
commission in the past, I think it is abundantly evident to anyone who has been
interested in the development of this capital
centre that a lack of authority, of drive and
of desire for accomplishment has been evident. The goings-on between the Federal
District Commission, the provincial authorities
and the municipal authorities, have interfered with the progress of the work that
should be done here.
I have in mind, by contrast, an admirable
example of dealing with changing plans in
municipal arrangement similar to problems
we have to deal with here. In New York
City, when changes have to be made, when
plans have to be effected to deal with that
very congested centre, the whole matter is
left in the hands of one man, Robert Moses,
who is the head of a corporation created by
the city and given full authority both financially and in an engineering way to proceed
with what bas to be done. I believe there
are in that city examples of accomplishments which would serve as a very fine
object lesson for those who have dreams
about the great future for the capital centre
of Canada.
Honourable senators, I wish to emphasize
again that the needs in connection with this
legislation constitute jurisdictional problems
rather than physical and financial difficulties.
Further, I believe if the eloquent words
which have been used in the application of
this future legislation are to reach any measure of reality, the pressing need is for practical ways and means of administering the
affairs of the commission. It should be reorganized at once, and a full-time head with
necessary authority should be appointed to
drive so many needed projects to a
conclusion.
Honourable senators, with these disjointed
and unprepared remarks I should like to
express my most hearty sympathy with the
spirit of this legislation, with the hope that
it will soon be clothed in pretentious garb
in keeping with the results we have all been
hoping for and that the development of a
capital centre here will proceed apace and
satisfy the outlook and aspirations of the
people of Canada.
Hon. W. Ross Macdonald: Honourable senators, it will be noted that the three splendid
addresses we have heard on this bill this
afternoon respecting the development and
improvement of the National Capital Region
were delivered by three honourable senators
who live in the city of Ottawa. It was my
hope that senators who come from other parts
of Canada would speak on this bill. After
all, this bill relates to the capital of Canada.
57075-4-391

611

It is our capital, and I think we should all
take pride, as I am sure we do, in this very
beautiful city.
I would also point out that with respect
to the two committees referred to this afternoon, the co-chairmen in each instance were
from elsewhere than the city of Ottawa.
My recollection of the first committee is
that the co-chairmen were the late Senator
Copp from the Maritimes, and Mr. Gregory
from western Canada; the co-chairmen of
the second committee were Senator Gershaw,
representing this house, and Mr. Dumas,
from the other house, neither of whom
lived in the city of Ottawa.
Honourable senators, this bill is of great
interest to us all and, as was pointed out,
it relates to a matter which has been of
interest to all our Prime Ministers since the
days of Sir Wilfrid Laurier. I recall that
Mr. Mackenzie King took a great interest in
developments not only in Ottawa city but in
the area on both sides of the river, and much
was accomplished along these lines during
the time he was Prime Minister. He wanted
to see, not a big Ottawa or a populous Hull,
but a great capital worthy of our country;
and what he started was carried on by his
successor and is being pursued by the present
Prime Minister. I am hopeful that honourable senators from other parts of the country
will demonstrate their interest in this bill,
which is of importance to all Canadians.
The national capital is not only a beautiful
city but comprises a beautiful district, for
it also takes in, as I pointed out, quite a
large area of adjoining land.
As for that part of the national capital
which is Ottawa, I do not suppose there is
any more beautiful sight, in the spring of
the year, than the tulips which may be
seen in front of this building and along the
driveway and in other parts of the city.
Thousands of people are attracted here to
see these beautiful flowers. Of course, we
are also proud of our buildings, and of the
lawn which stretches in front of this Parliament Building, although the scene is and
has been marred recently by the presence of
so many automobiles. It has occurred to me
that some place other than just around here
could be found for the parking of cars. I
know it is difficult to get space, but if we
are to have a beautiful city, and an attractive
area in this section, we must take away and
store elsewhere the things which mar its
appearance. I hope that the commission
will be able to provide accommodation elsewhere for the automobiles which at the
present time are spoiling in some degree
what is otherwise a very beautiful area.

612

Si'

There is one other feature of Ottawa which
has always been attractive to me and, I know,
to many others who come here, and that is
its bilingual aspect. Canada is a bilingual
country, and I am sure that everyone who
comes to Ottawa, no matter from what section, is delighted to hear another language
spoken. I have no doubt that visitors from
the province of Quebec enjoy hearing the
English language in our capital, and I am no
less certain that visitors to Ottawa from elsewhere in Ontario and from other Englishspeaking provinces are greatly interested to
hear-and keenly disappointed if they do not
hear-the language of our French fellow
citizens. Both languages have their place.
I do not mean that in one section French
only should be heard: I believe that in all
sections, if possible, both languages should
be spoken. To the extent that it is done it
constitutes an attraction for many people
who come to Ottawa, and numbers of them
have expressed to me disappointment when
they found that in a large degree Ottawa is
developing into an English-speaking city.
Another interesting feature of Ottawa
which appeals to me, though it may be objectionable to some of my friends, is the
market centre. Last Saturday I visited it,
and a more beautiful scene of the kind I
have never witnessed. The flowers, the fruit,
the vegetables, the people one saw therenot only citizens of Ottawa but others from
the rural districts-provided a scene peculiarly Canadien. One heard much conversation both in French and English. It is a very
interesting section of the city. I do not know
whether those responsible for administering
the plan propose to do away with the market
because it is not sufficiently businesslike, but
I hope that will never be done.
I repeat, Ottawa is a city full of beauty
and interest, and I trust that the commission's
work will make it even more beautiful and
interesting, and a worthy capital of our
country.

Hon. W. M. Aselline: Honourable senators,
I have listened with great interest to the
speeches which have been made on this bill.
All of you know that I come from the great
province of Saskatchewan, some 2,000 miles
from this great city; and some of us have a
little difficulty in persuading the people who
live out there that so many millions of dollars should be spent for the beautification of
Ottawa, even though it is the capital of
Canada. However, when any of my friends
from the west are here, I take them around
in my little automobile and show them the
beauties of the place, and having had the
plan explained to them, they go home filled
with enthusiasm for it.

j.

ATà.E

There are, however, one or two things about
this city which they do not like, and which
they think should be cleaned up. For example, a friend of mine went for a walk
one morning and was confronted with a row
of garbage cans miles in length. Out in
Saskatchewan, where there is plenty of land,
when we are planning our residential areas
we provide for a lane or an alleyway behind
the main streets, and that is where the garbage
cans go. But I notice with consternation,
when I go to Ottawa's outlying areas within
the city boundaries, that every bit of land
is utilized for buildings alone; there are no
lanes at the rear, the house or the building
covers practically the whole lot, and garbage
cans stand out in front as far as one can see.
I think planning of this kind is a big mistake,
and that when surveys of these new districts
are made there should be provision to eliminate that eyesore. I remember speaking on
this question on a previous occasion but no
action has been taken. I notice these new
surveys are not being carried out any differently from the ones that were made when
Ottawa became a townsite. Other than this
I have little to complain of. As a matter of
fact, I am enthusiastic about this whole
matter. I was a member of the joint committee which sat in 1956 and I was pleased
that the members of the Senate who sat on
that committee took such a prominent part
in its deliberations. As it has been stated,
we sat day after day when members of another house were so busy they could not
give the subject-matter as much attention
as they wished. Our members on that committee contributed substantially to the report
that was brought down.
Honourable senators, I have travelled all
around this great federal district. I viewed
the scenery with the greatest of pleasure
from many vantage points, particularly from
the heights across the river, and I would
like to see the National Capital Region considerably enlarged. I believe the 1955 plans
indicated that the McGregor Lake country
northeast of here comes within the boundaries of the Federal District. There is more
beautiful country a few miles east of there,
which belongs to the Wallingford family.
There are Battle Lake and Rheaume Lake
and other beautiful spots such as these which
could be purchased by the federal Government and made into a wonderful playground
for the people of Ottawa and district. I would
like to see the district extended beyond
what has been done by the acquisition of the
Green Belt area. Generally speaking, I believe all Canadians are becoming more and
more conscious of the fact that this is the
capital of our great country, and they want
to see it made into a beautiful capital of

AUGUST 19, 1958
which they and their children will be proud
of. For these reasons I arn wholeheartedly
behind this project and this legislation, knowing it will be a splendid thing for all
Canadians.
(Translation):
Hon. Cyrille Vaillancouri: Honourable senatprs, the bill which is before us today constitutes a symbol. It is called "An Act respecting the development and improvement
of the National Capital Region".
The word "national" is specifically mentioned. That being the case, it seems to me
that the capital of Canada will henceforth
not be restricted to the city of Ottawa, but
will include the surrounding district. A symbol of national unity is exemplified in such
a district; it extends, on both sides of the
Ottawa River, into the provinces of Ontario
and Quebec, which are connected by three
bridges.
Bytown, located at the edge of the province
of Quebec, and the foot of Chaudiere Falls,
had already been chosen as the capital of
Canada at the time of Confederation. It bas
become the city of Ottawa, seat of the
Government of Canada.
The Fathers of Confederation had decided
not only to build a beautiful city here but
also to develop both shores of the Ottawa.
Today, we are given the opportunity to make
their dream come true by passing this
bill.
The honourable Leader of the Opposition
(Hon. Mr. Macdonald) said that strangers
coming to Ottawa are happy to see that
bilingualism is a reality here and that French
is used as well as English.
If this bilingualism were practised on both
sides of the river, in both the sister provinces,
by the two great races who built our
country, it would be possible to improve our
fraternal relations and our unity which, at
times, are somewhat strained.
Once, when I was in England, I heard
Englishmen, Scotchmen and even Welshmen
say that they dreamed of being able, some
day, to visit London, the capital of the British
Isles.
Canadians feel the same way. From Gaspé
to the Rockies and even beyond, many people
want to visit the federal capital of this great
bilingual country, which is anxious to develop a closer union between the two racial
groups who built up this country, in order
that Canada may become greater, more prosperous and more closely united.

REFERRED TO COMMITTEE

The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators,
when shall this bill be read the third time?
Hon. Mr. Choquette: Next sitting.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Are you not going to
send it to committee?
Hon. Mr. Choquette: I thought honourable
senators were unanimous in their approval of
the bill and that it could be given the third
reading at the next sitting. However, if you
desire that it should be referred to
committeeHon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): While I
think it is agreed that the bill has the endorsation of every member of this house, there
may be some points in connection with its
draftsmanship that the Senate might like to
look into. I believe honourable senators generally would feel a little better if the bill went
to committee.
Hon. Mr. Choquette: Then I would move
that the bill be referred to the Standing
Committee on Natural Resources.
Motion agreed to.
PAROLE BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. Gustave Monette moved the second
reading of Bill C-49, to provide for the conditional liberation of persons undergoing sentences of imprisonment.
(Translation):
He said: After hearing the excellent remarks made by the honourable Leader of the
Opposition (Hon. Mr. Macdonald) a moment
ago on the French language which, in his
opinion should be spoken in the city of
Ottawa, I thought of introducing my bill in
French. However, it would seem more courteous and more in keeping with the spirit of
the discussion and also in the interest of those
who prepared the bill as well as my own,so that I may be well understood,-to introduce it in English.
(Text):
Honourable senators, this bill concerns inmates confined to penitentiaries and jails who
are serving sentences following conviction.
The bill introduces a new principle, or at
least it involves a substantial change in the
system now prevailing. For that reason, it
sems to me that I should explain it fully. The
bill involves changes as to a few important
points. First, it displaces the authority which
grants discretionary relief from or remission
of sentences of inmates in jails and penitentiaries. The bill also involves a change in
many substantial ancillary clauses, which I
could not deal with without covering almost

SENATE
all the sections of the bill, for they are interwoven with the important principle that I am
proposing to explain.
Honourable senators, this bill is intended
to implement almost completely the Fauteux
Committee report, which was made in April
1956. That committee carried on a study of
our penitentiary system and recommended
changes, most of which would be implemented
under this bill, which I now propose to
explain. The bill provides for the creation of
a National Parole Board, and the transfer
from the minister to that board of discretionary authority to grant remission of
sentences. That discretionary authority would
be given directly to the board. Some clauses
provide that the new bill shall not interfere
with the Prisons and Reformatories Act nor
with the Juvenile Delinquents Act. It would
be mandatory upon the new National Parole
Board to revise, without any request so to
do, all sentences of two years or longer on
inmates now in jail or penitentiary. The bill
also would make it mandatory for the board
to revise, upon request, all shorter sentences.
The bill also provides for suspension or
revocation of parole, and provides that there
shall be no appeal from any decision of the
board. The board is also given power to discard, suspend or quash sentences for offences
in relation to the operation of motor vehicles.
The bill repeals the Ticket of Leave Act.
The new act would come into force on
proclamation.
Honourable senators, as I have said, I propose, though not in detail, to give sorne substantial explanation of almost all the sections
of the bill.
First, I call attention to the definition of
the word "parole", which appears in section
2, paragraphs (d):
'parole" means authority granted under this net
to an inmate to be at large during his term of
imprisonment;

Paragraph (e) reads:
"paroled" inmate means a person to whom parole
has been granted;

The Fauteux Committee made a report,
from which I wish to read, in order to
explain more clearly the meaning of this
change. In this part of the report Mr.
Justice Fauteux was referring to the Ticket
of Leave Act which is now in force. I am
reading from the House of Commons Hansard
of August 11, 1958, page 3373.
That this legislation was never designed to meet
the complex problems of modern corrections, is
quite apparent from the difficulties that are
encountered in its administration under presentday conditions. We are astonished that such satisfactory results have been obtained in recent years
by the service under this antiquated legislation,
and much credit must be given to those who are
charged with the administration of it.

In dealing with the new bill, which as I
have said is intended to implement almost
fully the report of the Fauteux Committee,
I do not propose to take exception to the
remarks Mr. Justice Fauteux made. In spite
of the antiquated system which existed at
the time there is no reproach of those who
had charge of the administration of the
Ticket of Leave Act.
May I say, honourable senators, that the
recommendations of the Fauteux Committee
are highly commendable.
If I may be
allowed to say so, as one who has known
hirn for a long time, Mr. Justice Fauteux is
one of the outstanding judges of the Supreme
Court of Canada. Not only was he a prominent barrister in Montreal, but he had
exceptional experience in dealing with community affairs. He was a Crown prosecutor
for a great many years, having previously
served as an assistant Crown prosecutor, and
he dealt with practically every type of case
that comes before a Crown prosecutor in the
course of his duties. He acted not only in
provincial affairs, but later in federal affairs,
and he had a great deal to do with ticket of
leave cases. He was engaged in prosecutions under special federal acts. He was the
local prosecutor for the federal authority in
prosecutions of offences under the Narcotie
Drugs Act and other similar legislation in
the federal field dealing with crimes.
I
might add that to my knowledge at least
there was not, in my district in the province
of Quebec, a barrister who was better known
both for his honesty and his knowledge of
legal matters.
Honourable senators, before proceeding
with an explanation of the bill I will quote
a summary that I have accepted as mine:
Parole is a well-recognized procedure which is
designed to be a logical step in the reformation and
the rehabilitation of a prisoner who bas been convicted of an offence and as a result is undergoing
imprisonment. It is a procedure whereby an inmate

of an institution may bo released before the
expiration of his sentence so that he can serve
the balance of his sentence at large in society.
While serving the balance of his sentence at large
be is under appropriate social restraints which are
designed to ensure, so far as possible, that he
will live a law-abiding life in society.
Parole
is therefore a transitional step between close confinement in an institution and absolute freedom in
society. The sanction that is imposed for failure
to live up to the conditions that govern the
release is the return of the inmate to the institution.

I will now proceed to refer to the bill in
detail.
Section 3 of the bill provides for creation
of the National Parole Board and for its
composition. It is to be a board of not less
than three and not more than five members,
all appointed by the Governor in Council.
The board will have some judicial power,

AUGUST 19, 1958
and also administrative powers. The chairman of the board will be charged with the
administration of all that the board has to
decide upon, and therefore he will be both
an administrator and a part of the semijudicial body.
The head office of the board will be in the
city of Ottawa, as provided in subsection 6
of section 3, but meetings of the board may
be held at such other places as the board
determines.
The remuneration of members of the board
is stated by section 4 to be at the discretion
of the Governor in Council. And in subsection 3 of section 4 it is declared that the
chairman is a chief executive officer of the
board and has supervision over and direction
of the work of the staff of the board.
As to the powers of the board, section 5
first contains an exception. It reads:
Subject to this act and the Prisons and Reformatories Act, the board bas exclusive jurisdiction and
absolute discretion to grant, refuse to grant or
revoke parole.

As honourable senators know, the provinces
of Ontario and British Columbia have their
own provincial system of parole board. Within the limits of the powers of those provincial
boards the bill does not interfere. So far
as Ontario is concerned, the powers of the
provincial board relate to such sentences as
are partly definite and partly indefinite, the
indefinite period being intended as a time in
which parole could be granted, at the discretion of the provincial board. However,
nothing hinges on that. The jurisdiction given
to the provinces under the Prisons and Reformatories Act remains. The bill also does
not interfere with the Juvenile Delinquents
Act.
Apart from these limitations the board's
jurisdiction is exclusive. It is mandatory on
the parole board to review all sentences for
terms of two years or more; it need not receive a request from the inmates concerned
for a review. And it is made mandatory on
the board to review, on request, sentences
of less than two years. After reviewing the
case of an inmate the board will decide
whether or not to grant parole.
The Governor in Council is given power
to make certain regulations, as provided in
section 7 of the bill.
Section 8 gives the board power to grant
parole. Perhaps it will be sufficient if I read
the section, because it seems to be in very
clear terms;
The board may
(a) grant parole to an Inmate if the board considers that the inmate bas derived the maximum
benefit from Imprisonment and that the reform
and rehabilitation will be aided by the grant of
parole;

(b) grant parole subject to any terms or conditions it considers desirable;
(c) provide for the guidance and supervision of
paroled inmates for such period as the board considers desirable; and
(d) revoke parole in its discretion.

The board is not obliged to grant an interview to an inmate or any one on his behalf.
You will see all along a little difference
from when the parole system was under
the authority of a minister of the crown,
generally the Solicitor General. Everyone
knows that he was subject to being importuned by a number of persons to try to obtain
such and such a favour for someone whom
they represented. One of the suggestions
made in the Fauteux report, and one of the
aims of the bill, is to take the discretionary
jurisdiction away from the minister and
place it into the hands of an independent
parole board.
Section 1I contains an important provision:
(1) The sentence of a paroled inmate shall, while
the parole remains unrevoked and unforfeited, be
deemed to continue in force until the expiration
thereof according to law.
(2) Until a parole is revoked, forfeited or suspended the inmate is not liable to be imprisoned
by reason of his sentence, and he shall be allowed
to go and remain at large according to the termas
and conditions of the parole and subject to the
provisions of this act.

Section 12, deals with suspension of parole, and is also important. It reads:
(1) A member of the board or any person
designated by the Board may, by a warrant in
writing signed by him, suspend any parole and
authorize the apprehension of a paroled inmate
whenever he is satisfied that the arrest of the inmate
is necessary or desirable in order to prevent a
breach of any term or condition of the parole.
(2) A paroled inmate apprehended under a warrant issued under this section shall be brought as

soon as conveniently may be before a magistrate,
and the magistrate shall remand the inmate in
custody until the board cancels the suspension or
revokes the parole.
(3) The board shall forthwith after a remand by
a magistrate under subsection (2) review the case

and shall either cancel the suspension or revoke
the parole.
(4) An inmate who is in custody by virtue of
this section shall be deemed to be serving his
sentence.

The inmate is not immediately sent back to
the penitentiary from which he came but is
kept in custody pending the decision of the
board; and the period so spent in custody is
counted in his favour against the serving
of his sentence.
Section 13 provides:
If a paroled inmate is convicted of an Indictable
offence, committed after the grant of parole and
punishable by imprisonment for a term of two
years or more, his parole is thereby forthwith
forfeited.

Honourable senators will observe the
powers of the board in that respect. If in
the opinion of the board the inmate does not

SENATE
deserve to continue his parole, it is cancelled
by the board. If the inmate commits a
criminal offence, the parole is automatically
forfeited, and the board does not even have
to pronounce on it.
Section 14 deals with apprehension, and
perhaps I could dispense with reading it.
Subsection (2) of that section deals with the
recommitment of the inmate to the peniten-

tiary from which he came, if the board decides
he should be returned because of his behaviour in jail or for other reasons.
Section 15 deals with the execution of
warrants for apprehension.
Section 16 has to do with the recommitment of an inmate and the place of recommitment. I have already explained that point:
if an inmate who is on parole has his parole
cancelled, he goes back to the penitentiary;
but if his parole is forfeited because of the
commission of a new crime, he automatically
goes back to the penitentiary.
Section 17 is easily understood, but nevertheless it is an important section. Subsection (1) reads:

Hon. Mr. Dupuis: In what circumstances
might a man be convicted under the Motor
Vehicles Act and be condemned to be
whipped?
Hon. Mr. Croll: No, no.
Hon. Mr. Dupuis: As the honourable senator read the subsection, it indicates the
board could revoke such a sentence.
Hon. Mr. Monette: I cannot give my
honourable friend a detailed answer on that
point, but if an accused is condemned to be
that
whipped, the board may revoke
sentence.
Hon. Mr. Croll: But whipping cannot be
ordered under the Motor Vehicles Act.
Hon. Mr. Monelie: Subsection (2) of section 18 reads:

PAROLE BILL
SECOND

READING

The Senate resumed from yesterday the
adjourned debate on the motion of Hon. Mr.
Monette for the second reading of Bill C-49,
to provide for the conditional liberation of
persons undergoing sentences of imprisonment.

Parole offers an opportunity for the practical
application of rehabilitation programs prior ta the
expiration of sentence. It encourages the inmate
ta maintain maximum contact with relatives,
friends, and prisoners' aid and after-care societies,
thus keeping him keenly aware of the existence
of a free society of which he continues ta be a
member despite his imprisonment. The prospect of
parole stimulates the inmate ta derive maximum
benefit from the facilities provided by the prison
as preparation for parole, i.e., the educational,
vocational, religious, recreational and otber services
furnished by the institution. It offers assistance
ta the individual upon release. The possibility of
parole revocation operates as a deterrent ta antisocial conduct. The possibility of parole may be
an incentive ta good conduct in the institution.
Parole provides a means whereby, in proper cases,
the term of imprisonment may be shortened. It
allows the timing of release ta be related ta the
completion of vocational and
other
training
programs.

I thought that was a good description of
the very desirable practice which has been
in existence for many years.
As honourable senators know, it was my
privilege for a number of years to hold the
important office of Solicitor General of Canada. During that time the Ticket of Leave
Act under which parole was granted was
administered by the Solicitor General, and
in that capacity I reviewed the applications
of thousands of inmates of institutions who
were seeking parole. You may think that
that was a difficult and onerous task. Well,
honourable senators, I will say it was an
onerous task, and it would have been impossible for me to have performed it but
for the excellent staff with which I was
surrounded. The head of the Remission
Branch is known as the Director of Remission
Service. During the time that I was Solicitor
General the Director was-and indeed still

57075-4-401
Hon. W. Ross Macdonald: Honourable senators will recall that yesterday afternoon
the honourable gentleman from Mille Isles
(Hon. Mr. Monette) explained this bill quite
clearly. He pointed out that the bill is based
on the report of a committee appointed to
inquire into the principles and procedures
followed in the Remission Service of the
Department of Justice of Canada. The Chairman of the committee was the Honourable
Mr. Justice Fauteux. One of the committee's
recommendations was that the Ticket of
Leave Act should be repealed and that a
National Parole Board should be established.
This bill provides for the setting up of the
National Parole Board.
Honourable senators will be interested, I
am sure, in what I might call the definition
of "parole" as set forth on page 51 of the
committee's report. It reads as follows:

SENATE

Honourable senators, I have not the figures
for all the years, but in 1955, which was the
first full year in which I was Solicitor General, I recommended the granting of tickets
of leave to 1,345 men who were in our penal
institutions. In 1956 I recommended 1,423
tickets of leave. The average, you will be
interested to know, was about one application granted for every three applications
which were made. In 1955 there were 4,000
applications for parole, and of those 1,345
were granted, which is about one in three; in
1956 there were about 5,000 applications, and
in that year 1,423 were granted, which is
about a little better than one in three. Now,
as I say, it would have been impossible for
me to have reviewed in detail every application, but I can assure honourable senators
that every application was reviewed with
the greatest care by Mr. MacLeod and the
officials directly under him and those associated with them. In other words, every
application received the personal consideration of officials of the Department of the
Solicitor General. It was a very heavy task
for them.
Hon. Mr. Euler: May I ask my friend a
question? Must a prisoner have served some
specified part of his sentence before parole
can be granted?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: The general practice
was not to grant parole before an inmate
had served half of his sentence, but that was
not a definite rule. I might say it was also
the general practice that if a man was a repeater he probably would have to serve a
little longer time before parole was granted.
On the other hand, if a prisoner was a first
offender and his offence was more or less
of a minor nature his application might be
considered before half of his sentence was
served. That was the general rule.
I think honourable senators will be interested to know that of the 1,345 tickets of
leave granted in 1955, only 25 were ordered
revoked; and of the 1,423 tickets of leave
granted in 1956, only 50 were ordered revoked. What I mean is that in each of those
cases the man on ticket of leave had broken
the restrictions under which it was issued to
him and in some cases he committed another
offence. When another offence is committed
by a man on parole he is automatically
brought back to the penitentiary to complete
his term.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Does the half-sentence
period apply to prisoners who have committed crimes of violence?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I would put it this
way, that if a man had committed a crime of
violence the likelihood of obtaining a ticket

of leave at half time was very slight, although
that would not prevent him from making an
application and having it considered.
It seems to me that the figures I have given
of the relatively small number of ticket of
leave cases that had to bo revoked are proof
that my officials were not too lenient.
I think we can feel assured that during all
this time the Ticket of Leave Act has been
exceptionally well administered, and I give
full credit to the officials of the department.
Honourable senators may wonder why in
these circumstances a change is now proposed.
Well, in the first place, I would point out, as
the honourable senator from Mille Isles (Hon.
Mr. Monette) did yesterday, that there is no
criticism whatever of the administrators of
the Ticket of Leave Act in the Fauteux
Report. In effect, the report does not criticize
in any way the administration and the Ticket
of Leave Act by the ministers of the Crown
over the years. There was no suggestion that
the exercise of influence had ever had any
effect on the granting or revoking of tickets
of leave.
The honourable senator from Mille Isles
said that pressure was sometimes put upon
the minister in order to obtain a ticket of
leave. During the almost four years that I
administered that act no one ever endeavoured
to put pressure upon me to release a man
before he had served his time, unless he was
worthy of the release, and I think I can say
the same for my officials. Pressure was not
put upon them. The public seemed to realize
that it was useless to try pressure on that
department. That feeling did not come into
existence during my period of office but had
grown up over the years.
At page 55 of its report the Fauteux committee said:
That this legislation was never designed to meet
the complex problems of modern corrections, is
quite apparent from the difficulties that are encountered in its administration under present day
conditions.

The committee felt that in spite of the
complexity of the problems of the present
Ticket of Leave Act, it had been well administered; in fact, so well that the committee
was surprised that such splendid results had
been achieved.
Hon. Mr. Choquette: May I ask a question
of the honourable gentleman? As I remember,
under the present act a commission travels
to, for instance, Toronto or Montreal, to study
cases and hear evidence on applications, for
ticket of leave. Does the new bill provide
that such a commission should travel to the
ten provinces and hear such applications?

AUGUST 20, 1958
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Under the present
Ticket of Leave Act officials of the Remission Service travel from institution to institution at certain times. At most of the
institutions there are officials who interview
inmates and report on them. But prior to
reports being made, officials in each institution arrange that inmates be interviewed
and advised as to their making application
for ticket of leave, and the progress which
the inmates have made in the institution
is also discussed at that time. For instance,
a prisoner may be taking a course in mechanics, stenography or some special forrm of
training. He is in touch with someone in the
institution who is watching his progress, and
at the appropriate time that official reports
to a higher authority in the institution, in
many cases to the warden. The report of
the warden then comes to Mr. MacLeod's
branch at Ottawa, and he or his officials may
feel it would be advisable for someone from
that branch to visit the institution and interview the inmate personally. That may be
done.
So, under the present act the members of
the commission or their representatives are
free to move about from institution to
institution and obtain information by the
method which was mentioned.
Hon. Mr. Monette: And go anywhere in
Canada.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Anywhere in Canada.
Hon. Mr. Méthot: Is it possible that a man
may be granted a ticket of leave without
even entering prison?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: That would come
under the heading of probation. A man who
was found guilty by a magistrate might not
be sent to prison but put on probation for a
period of time. Parole takes effect when a
man who bas been sentenced to an institution is released before his term bas expired
because it is felt he can regain his place
in society and live properly with his fellowmen.
Hon. Mr. Méthot: But a man could be
paroled the day after he was sentenced?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: It is possible to be
paroled after one day of sentence, but that
is not likely to happen. That probably would
come under the heading of clemency, in
such special circumstances as where a man,
or his wife, was ill.
Hon. Mr. Monette: Does section 6 of the
bill throw any light on that point?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Section 6 (1) reads:
6. (1) The board shall at the times prescribed by
the regulations
(a) review the case of every inmate serving a
sentence of imprisonment of two years or more,

whether or not an application has been made by
or on behalf of the inmate, and
(b) review such cases of inmates serving a
sentence of imprisonment of less than two years as
are prescribed by the regulations, upon application
by or on behalf of the inmate.
Hon. Mr. Monette: So it could be done at
any time?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: It could be done at
any time, but it is not likely to take place
before the half-way mark in the prison term.
The bill requires that the board shall review the case of every convicted person
serving a prison sentence of two years or
more, and this must be done whether or not
an application for parole bas been made. Well,
honourable senators, I may say that the practice through the years has been that the case
of every inmate of our penal institutions
has been reviewed within a reasonable length
of time. There was no law requiring the
Solicitor General to review the cases, but in
practice that was done, and all the inmates
of the institutions knew of their right to
make application for parole. I should think
it would be a very rare case where an inmate
did not know that he could make such an
application.
The proposed legislation makes no great
changes. It provides that applications for
ticket of leave be made to the proposed
National Parole Board instead of to the Solicitor General. There is, I think, considerable
advantage in this procedure, and I am in
full accord with it. I am sure the public will
be more satisfied to have applications made
to such a board than to a member of the
cabinet. I wonder whether the board will
be able to act as speedily as a single individual can. It will sit at certain stated
periods. Under the Ticket of Leave Act if
an application is made today in an urgent
case, the investigation can be put under way
tomorrow and a report received in a matter
of two or three days. It is not necessary to
assemble a commission: the Director of the
Remission Service, upon receipt of the report,
would immediately get in touch with the
Solicitor General, discuss the case with him,
and the application would be granted, or not.
Under the new section speed may be sacrificed, for, as I have mentioned, the present
system provides facilities for getting information rapidly, coming to a conclusion, and
making an order, without the necessity of
assembling a board to deal with the case.
Perhaps I should point out that there is a
change in the law as it affects those who
break the provisions under which they are
released. Under the present act, if the Remissions Branch had information that a parolee
was acting in a manner from which it
appeared that he might be about to break the

SENATE

law-if, for example, he was mixing with
an undesirable class, or otherwise was not
living up to the conditions of his ticket of
leave-the branch could take one of two
courses: it could do nothing about it, or, if
it decided to act, instructions would have
to be given to take the man into custody
and return him to the institution from which
he had been released. Sometimes the information given to the department was incorrect
and a man was taken back to the institution
although he should not have been returned
there: in that event he would be released. By
section 12, subsection 2, of the present bill it
is provided that, upon receipt of reports that
a paroled man is not acting in the way he
should do, and it is suspected that he has
committed a crime or is about to commit one,
he can be taken immediately into custody.
In that event he is not returned to the
institution from which he was freed, but is
put in the local jail, brought before the
magistrate, and held pending investigation by
the board. If it is determined upon full
investigation that the parole should be
revoked, the necessary order is made and the
man is returned to the institution from which
he was released. This, I think, is about the
only respect in which the bill differs from the
Ticket of Leave Act, under which all the
powers now to be entrusted to a board were
vested in the person who administered the
act. Of course the Ticket of Leave Act could
have been amended to include this provision.
However, I would repeat that I am fully in
accord with the recommendation of the
Fauteux report that a parole board should be
set up.
Yesterday the honourable senator from
Kennebec (Hon. Mr. Vaillancourt) asked
whether the board will have power to make a
recommendation in a capital case. The answer
is that it will not. Clemency in this respect
is a prerogative of the Crown, which accepts
the recommendation made, after discussion
with his cabinet colleagues, by the Solicitor
General. The provisions of the law with
regard to commutation of sentence in capital
cases will remain, as hitherto, a prerogative
of the Crown, and the Crown will act on
advice of the Council. The board has no
power to pardon; the Solicitor General will
remain responsible for recommendations to
His Excellency that pardons be granted. He
can also recommend remissions of fines and
other pecuniary penalties. If I may interrupt
myself, I will add that it is in capital cases
only that the minister who administers the
Ticket of Leave Act consults with his cabinet
colleagues before the recommendation is
made: it is the Governor who acts. In respect
of other offences the recommendations are
made by the Solicitor General; they include

the remission of fines and other pecuniary
penalties, also the return of goods which
have been forfeited. Cases arise where a man
who is sent to the penitentiary should be
removed to hospital, or because, say, of the
death of a close relative, should be released
for a short time to attend the funeral service.
In such cases the recommendation will not
be a function of the board, but will remain
with the Solicitor General. Other examples
include the remission of sentences of imprisonment on compassionate grounds. In answer
to the question asked a minute ago by the
honourable senator for Mille Isles (Hon. Mr.
Monette), where a man has been in prison
for a very short time and holds that, under
the circumstances, he should be released
immediately, his application will go to the
Solicitor General, not to the board.
That is all I have to say, except that, as
one connected with the former administration, I want to pay tribute to the organizations
which have taken such an interest in the
welfare of offenders after they have been
released from institutions. Not only are there
a number of such organizations, but there are
quite a few individuals who are interested
in this matter. I have often felt that it
would be much easier for those who have
been in institutions, if, upon their release,
they could be received into society without
the stigma which attaches to their having
been in prison. Many of them have a very
difficult task to re-establish themselves. As
soon as they apply for a job someone will
inform the prospective employer, and even
before the man is hired, or shortly afterward, his record will become known.
Hon. Mr. Choquette: Do the Mounted Police
not give that information?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: They do not inform
the employer.
Hon. Mr. Choquette: Often they do.

Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I should not think
they would inform the employer.
Hon. Mr. Choquette: If the employer asks
the Mounted Police?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Oh, yes.
Hon. Mr. Choquette: But is there no pro-

vision made to prevent that after, let us
say, three or four years?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: There is no provision
for it. What happens is that sometimes a
man who has been out of an institution for
some period, let us say four years, and has
led a good home life and conducted himself
well in society, will apply for a job. Then
someone comes along and informs the prospective employer that the man has been in

AUGUST 20, 1958
a penal institution and it becomes difficult
for the man to get employment. This is so
particularly when a man applies for a job
immediately after he is released. When a man
has been released from an institution, where
he has received some training, he should
be given a chance to get employment and be
treated as an ordinary citizen. I am not
suggesting that in every case such persons
should be taken into our homes, but I do say
they should not be reminded of their prison
sentence every time they apply for a job.
How can a man ever get a job under those
circumstances?
Hon. Mr. McDonald: Isn't that situation
improving?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I think it has been
improving, but I hope that it will improve
even more.
Hon. Mr. McDonald: The John Howard
Society has been helping to rehabilitate these
people.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Yes. I was going to
mention that organization. But I am talking
about people, individuals like ourselves, who
can do a small part to re-establish these men
who have broken the laws of our society but
who are now prepared to return and behave
themselves in that society. They have paid
their penalty, and if we were to take a
sympathetic view towards these persons they
would have a far better chance of becoming re-established. I should point out that
the Remission Service has representatives
throughout Canada who give counsel to those
who are released from prison. In most cases
they report periodically to the Remission
Service representative during their period of
parole, and sometimes they continue to report
after their parole has ceased. The departmental representatives located in these
centres across Canada try to obtain employment for ex-prisoners and keep them in the
straight and narrow path. There are also a
number of public-minded organizations which
do a great deal to help rehabilitate their
fellow citizens and I would like to pay tribute
to them now. The honourable gentleman from
Kings (Hon. Mr. McDonald) mentioned the
John Howard Society, which bas branches
throughout Canada. The Salvation Army also
has done and is continuing to do a splendid
work in this connection. There are two such
societies in the province of Quebec: La Société
d'Orientation et de Réhabilitation Sociale in
Montreal, and the Service de Réadaptation
Sociale Inc. in Quebec. These societies also
are doing a splendid work.
Hon. Mr. Croll: There is the Elizabeth Fry
Society.

Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Yes. I did not intend
to refer to all these societies, but there are
other societies which are also rendering this
splendid service.
Honourable senators, I feel that the introduction of this bill is a step forward in the
rehabilitation of those who are in our penal
institutions. It will result in more satisfaction in the way that applications for parole
are granted although, as I said before, I am
sure that in actual fact the results cannot be
any better than they have been. However,
I feel it is in the public interest that this bill
should be passed.
Hon. David A. Croll: Honourable senators,
this is the second bill having to do with
penitentiaries that has come before the Senate
during the present session. I was in the bouse
earlier when the honourable gentleman from
Shawinigan (Hon. Mr. Méthot) explained a
bill to amend the Penitentiary Act. I had intended to speak on that measure, but the
amendment was of little significance and I
knew that this bill to provide for the conditional liberation of persons undergoing
sentences of imprisonment-known by the
short title of the Parole Bill-was to be
introduced in the other house later in the
session. Thus I chose to wait and speak to
this bill.
This legislation is of importance not only to
people undergoing sentences of imprisonment
but to Canadians generally. I intend this
afternoon to put a bit of meat on the bare
bones of the Parole Board and to examine a
little into the cause and effect of the problem and what we are doing about it.
Honourable senators will recall that this
bouse held a notable discussion on penal
reform during the sessions of 1956 and 1957.
We had before us the then recently published
Fauteux report, containing some 44 recommendations. I believe this bill is based on
one of the really significant recommendations
in that report. Any time we make some
reformation that affects prisoners it is important, it cannot be insignificant. I believe
about a dozen senators contributed to that
debate on penal reform and as a result of our
discussions some reforms have been brought
about. We are favoured in the Senate by
time and continuity. My plea is that more
senators should take an interest in this important and sometimes negelected aspect of
human affairs. Prisoners are helpless people
and they are worthy of salvage. Unlike the
other place there is really no payoff here, but
those of us who have followed the course of
penal reform for some years will realize
the personal satisfaction of being able to do
something for these people. We have heard
the honourable Leader of the Opposition

SENATE
(Hon. Mr. Macdonald) this afternoon indicate with pride what he did when he was
Solicitor General. He deserves the commendation which I hope to pay him as I go along
in this discussion.
In this phase of public responsibility,
certainly we can say to one another, "You are
What the people
your brother's keeper."
behind the bars need is a kind, sympathetic
and understanding approach, in order that
they may pay their debt to society and again
be accepted by society.
Honourable senators, I cannot do better
than to quote some words to you, but for
the moment I shall not say who uttered
them:
The mood and temper of the public with regard
to the treatment of crime and criminals is one
of the most unfailing tests of the civilization of
any country.
A calm, dispassionate recognition of the rights
of the accused, and even of the convicted criminal
-a desire and an eagerness to rehabilitate in the
world of industry those who have paid their due
in the hard coinage of punishment; tireless efforts
toward the discovery of curative processes; unfailing faith that there is treasure, if we can only
find it, in the heart of every man-these are the
symbols which, in the treatment of crime and the
criminal, mark and measure the stored-up strength
of a nation.

Those are Churchillian words. They were
spoken by Churchill in the House of Commons at Westminster in 1910. It can easily
be appreciated that we really have not made
too much progress; the problem was there
at that time. I think we have failed-and
this is a collective failure-to realize that
prisoners are people with the same emotions
and ambitions as any other human beings.
The fact that they have broken the law and
are incarcerated does not stamp out their
desires and ambitions. We do not solve the
problem by locking them up, because prison
experience usually brings out the worst in
a man and leaves a permanent scar on his
personality. In our country, unfortunately,
most prisons are maximum security institutions, and they cannot perform miracles.
Ninety-nine per cent of the people who go
to prison return to the community, so it is
important for us to salvage and restore hope
and confidence to these people.
Let me give some interesting figures, which
I took from the annual report of the Commissioner of Penitentiaries. The prison population in 1956 was 5,508; in 1957 it was
5,433. That is a decrease of 130, some of the
decrease applying to Saskatchewan and
Manitoba, and to St. Vincent de Paul and
Of
Dorchester. That is very significant.
that total of 5,433 inmates, 1,075 had no
previous record. The first offenders were
19.78 per cent of that total. In 1956 first
offenders were 20.58 per cent; in 1955, 22.4

per cent, and in 1954, 22.9 per cent. Thus we
have made a little progress in that respect.
General recidivism, which includes all
previous known offences, is 80.22 per cent.
In 1956 it was 79.41 per cent; in 1955, 77.6
per cent. The percentage has gone up a little.
Penitentiaries recidivists, in 1957, were
44.87 per cent, being an increase of .92 per
cent over 1956; in 1955, 42.5 per cent, and in
1954, 38 per cent. That is not a good sign.
I think the bouse will be interested in
knowing who goes to prison. Well, I gave a
prison population of 5,433 for 1957. Of these,
5,123 were Canadian subjects. Of the balance
of 310-99 were born in the British Isles
or a British country; and the remaining 211
were foreign born: United States, 68; Poland,
31; Russia, 18; Italy 13; Hungary, 13.
In 1939 there was a population of 474
foreign-born inmates in the penitentiaries,
as against 211 in 1957, the last year for
which I have figures. The departmental report had something to say about the nationality of inmates, and I will now read
from that report:
The Immigration Department announced up to
May 31, 1957, Canada accepted over 1,500,000 immigrants since January 1, 1946. There is at the present
time in our country one foreign born person for
every 15 subjects. The present number of foreign
born inmates (211) appears to be an indication of
the good conduct of these people who came to
reside in Canada and also that they appreciate
such a privilege at its real value.

It was very nice of the department to
make that comment. I think it is a matter of
concern, importance and pride.
I turn now to young inmates. Young inmates under 21 years of age showed an increase in 1957 of 34 over that of 1956. The
percentage in 1957 stood at 12.94; in 1956,
at 12.14, a slight increase. A great deal of
danger lies there.
Releases are made for various reasons.
During 1957, 2,384 inmates were released,
made up as follows: 1,663 by expiration of
sentences, 637 by ticket of leave, 47 by unconditional release, 9 by court order, 20
died, 8 discharged for other reasons.
The report for 1956 is somewhat different,
and I must bring it to the attention of the
bouse. According to the 1956 report 2,406
inmates were discharged, 1,572 by expiration of sentences, 723 by ticket of leave,
70 by unconditional release, 14 by court
order, 17 died, 10 were discharged for other
reasons. The report for 1956 then it goes on
to say, at the top of page 17:
It is noted with great satisfaction that the new
policy of the Remission Service in extending the
facilities of the Ticket of Leave Act is bringing
results. Far more inmates were discharged this
year by way of ticket of leave than has been
the case heretofore.

AUGUST 20, 1958
The new policy is described in the 1954
report.
In 1956 we released 723 by ticket of leave,
and particular attention was called by the
department to that significant trend. But in
1957 we released only 637 by ticket of leave.
While I am talking about ticket of leave
may I say this: the Leader of the Opposition
(Hon. Mr. Macdonald) was Solicitor General
in 1956. He had a broad understanding of
prison reform, a deep interest in it, he was
generous and helpful, and these very large
numbers of releases were made during his
regime.
It is unfortunate that in the 1957 report
no comment was made on the lesser number
of releases under ticket of leave, but it may
be that this bill will now have the effect
that we all want it to have, that is, they
will take a broad look at this country and
lay down broad policies which will have
the effect of putting people back into circulation and giving them that opportunity for
rebabilitation that has been denied them in
the past.
In so far as creeds are concerned, the
prisons represent all of us, some more so.
Honourable senators, it has just been
pointed out to me I should make clear that
what I was talking about was ticket of leave
from penitentiaries. I was reading from the
Annual Report of Penitentiaries. There is,
of course, ticket of leave from some other
institutions, but I am not dealing with that
at the present time.
The Fauteux report I recommend very
highly to you. If you ever see my copy you
will see it all marked up. I find it intriguing
reading. Whenever I am a little tired or
looking for one of these dime novels to read
I find that I can read and reread this report,
and it is very easy reading. When it was
presented it was a challenge to the people
of Canada to scale new heights, for if we
did everything that Mr. Justice Fauteux and
his commission recommend we would be well
on our way to a real penal system that would
not penalize but that would rehabilitate.
That will take some time, we do not expect
it to be put into effect over night. A
challenge lies in that report, because 44
recommendations were made there and every
one of them is significant.
No one can deny that our penal system is
backward. It has already been admitted here
that our parole system has been neglected
and is one of the most backward in the whole
worid. That is why we have constantly urged
not only this Government but the previous
Government time and time again to put these
recommendations into effect. If you think
I am hard on this Government for failure
to implement the Fauteux report you should

read some of the things I said about the
other Government, which did not put into
effect the Archambault report, which was a
more significant document in its day. It may
interest honourable senators to know that
prisoners are allowed to read the Fauteux
report but they are still not allowed to read
the Archambault report, because it goes even
further in many respects than the Fauteux
report does.
Of course, the outstanding recommendation
in the Fauteux report was the replacement
of the part-time Regional Parole Boards by
a full-time five-man board with exclusive
jurisdiction over all prisoners, no matter
where they were sentenced. The automatic
review of all records of prisoners is already
in force in all other progressive countries
and now it is coming into effect in Canada
for the first time.
The Fauteux Committee said that in their
opinion prisoners should be eligible for parole
at any time without having to go through
an application centre at Ottawa or any other
place. It is very interesting to know that out
of every 1,000 people released on parole in
Ontario, the only province for which I have
statistics, only 45 were returned to prison.
You can see in this the saving in lives and
money.
Our antiquated penal system cries out for
attention. We come here today and freely
admit that the Ticket of Leave Act has not
been changed much since 1899. A new world
bas come about since then and we have
been left holding on to that Ticket of Leave
Act. I know in practice it bas been modified
by people in office who have used their
heads, but actually we have done very little
about it. So it is not surprising that I can
give you some figures that will startle you
but are true.
We have in Canada a population of 17
million and a jail population of 120,000. The
British have a population of 43 million and
they have 33,000 in their jails. There are
almost three times as many people in Britain
as in Canada yet we have four times as many
people in jail. Furthermore, the repeaters
in Britain amount to only 15 per cent,
whereas the repeaters in Canada are almost
60 per cent.
Of course, we are plagued by dual jurisdiction in this country and instead of doing
something about prisons and prisoners we are
engaged in passing the buck from the
province to the dominion and from the
dominion to the province. In the meantime
we are manufacturing criminals in our
institutions. The former Government pigeonholed the Archambault report. It came in
1939 and there was a war, and so there was
some justification. A little bit after the war

SENATE
it was difficult to get anything done about it,
there were many pressing problems. We
have got to make sure that this Fauteux
Report does not suffer the same fate. It is
really very easy to understand, and there is
only one principle in the modern penal
system, "keep as many offenders as possible
out of prison".
I think it is fair for me to say it without
casting any reflection, that the present prison
administration has not had the confidence or
respect of civilians and certainly not of
inmates.
The report of the Fauteux Committee was
uncritical; it was very careful to indicate
the road we should take.
Prisons, like schools, cannot be better than
the public opinion on which they rest. Far
too many people in our country want to step
on a prisoner and make him suffer; they
so to speak, want to get back at him for
what he has done to society. I need only
remind honourable senators of the Biblical
statement, "The way of the transgressor is
hard."
It is well for us to understand that many
prisoners are emotionally troubled persons,
who need the help of society to become emotionally mature and self-respecting citizens.
A bitter and vindictive attitude to prisoners
is a luxury the public cannot afford; we with
our small population in this small country
can least afford it. It costs money when a
prisoner enters prison. If he commits further
crimes, it means more cost to the citizens.
The Archambault Commission report of 1938
stated that 80 prisoners cost the country over
$25,000 each for apprehension, trial and detention, and the cases were documented.
We have to reduce our prison population;
among civilized people, of how to treat the
criminal. Retributive justice, an eye for an
eye and a tooth for a tooth, has long been
rejected as unworthy of a civilized state.
Today's objective is threefold: first, to prevent criminals from being a menace to their
fellow citizens; second, to train them in such
a way that others may not follow their example; and third, to do them good, not harm,
by checking their career of crime at the outset
and seeking remedies for those already
steeped in it.
After conviction our aim should be rehabilitation. The starting point must be that
the offender is a human being, who has been
controlled and guided by officials who themselves are human beings, trained, experienced
and inspired by the sympathy which comes
from a sense of vocation.
The United Nations has made a study of
penology and this is its recommendation: that
prisoners should be taught trades, set to work,

and paid a rate comparable to a normal industrial wage so that they could pay for their
keep in prison, maintain their families, meet
their social insurance payments and save
something for the day of discharge-yes, and
pay some compensation to their victims.
Thus, from prisons as a place of punishment, we must start with a new concept. The
new conception of them must be as places
where offenders may be trained to have
decent lives and to think of themselves as
citizens; places where offenders can work
out their own personal redemption by paying
their debt to society. To meet such a concept we need more and better prison buildings, more and better men in the prison
service, and men who can put their heart
into their work. We also need to know more,
and to pass on our experimental knowledge
to jurisdictions whose function it is to sentence offenders, and to the executive which
deals with them after conviction.
We have always maintained that the United
Kingdom is a good example in this field, and
it is. There they have part-time prisons for
young people under the age of 21 years who
have committed offences but have not yet
become hardened criminals. The theory is
that a taste of prison life will be enough
to straighten out these young people who are
high spirited rather than criminal Thus, they
aim to salvage the offender rather than
harden hirm in criminal tendencies, and in
this respect they have succeeded.
Sweden follows the practice by which se-lected prisoners near the end of their terms
are transferred from full-time to part-time
prisons. They work at regular day jobs
through the day and return at a specified
hour each evening. By the time they are
released many are adjusted to ordinary life
in a way that would be difficult without
preparation. Here are two approaches, each
different, yet seeking to lessen the number
of people who grow from first offenders to
hardened criminals.
British Columbia is doing some very interesting experimental work by way of giving
freedom in easy steps over the last month
of a prisoner's term. I have here an interesting clipping from the Ottawa Citizen of
October 21, 1957, which tells about one phase
of an interesting experiment. The article
reads, in part:

Isn't that enough to tear the heart out of
people who appreciate the plight of this
prisoner, being fed into society slowly, but
who is afraid to get out of his car because
everybody is looking at him? The clipping
continues:

The honourable senator from Mille Isles
and the honourable Leader of the Opposition
have read the definition of "parole" in the
Archambault report, so I will not quote it.
I have indicated that our parole system
slipped last year, after some progress. That is
disappointing. We are now at the point of
taking a long forward step. It is long overdue.
Once we pass this bill we must not forget it.
When we assemble next year we must be on
our toes to find out what has been done, by
obtaining a report as to what further progress
has been made to implement the recommendations of the Fauteux Committee.
I have indicated, clearly, I believe, what
is in the minds of the public, and I can tell
you that they consider parole boards are
tough and unsympathetic. But it is of record
that, of 1,000 persons released on parole, only
45 return to prison. That indicates that the
majority of prisoners learn their lesson and
are prepared to go straight if they have a
chance.
In conclusion, may I repeat that the bill
before us is a commendable forward step on
the road to prison reform and rehabilitation.
I am very happy to support it.
Hon. Mr. Monette: Honourable senators,Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Honourable senators,
before the honourable senator from Mille
Isles (Hon. Mr. Monette) closes the debate,
may I refer to a question which was asked
of me by the honourable senator from Ottawa
East (Hon. Mr. Choquette)? He referred to
the parole boards which visit institutions
throughout the provinces. That type of parole
board functions under the provincial Legislatures and has jurisdiction over persons
sentenced to an indefinite period of confinement. The honourable senator will recall that
quite frequently a man is sentenced to, say, a
year definite and six months indefinite. The
provincial parole boards deal with the indefinite period.
Hon. Gustave Monette: Honourable senators,The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, if the honourable gentleman from Mille
Isles (Hon. Mr. Monette) speaks now his
remarks will have the effect of closing the
debate.
Hon. Mr. Monette: I just want to thank
the honourable Leader of the Opposition
(Hon. Mr. Macdonald) for his splendid contribution to the study of this bill. In moving
the second reading of the bill I purposely
refrained from referring to his work as

Solicitor General, for I knew that he would
explain the work the department did during
the period of time he was in charge of it.
I knew, too, that no one could speak with
greater authority and wisdom than he, because of the experience he has had. I was
pleased to hear him say that there is no
blame being made by anyone here, or implied
in the bill itself, with respect to the personnel who have worked in the past under the
ticket of leave system. I also have some
knowledge of what was done by these people
and I commend them for their services.
Reference has been made to the chief of the
Remission Service, Mr. A. J. MacLeod, and
I agree with what bas been said about him.
May I include in this tribute Mr. MacLeod's
immediate predecessor, Mr. Michael Francis
Gallagher, who was appointed to that position on his return from attending the signing of the Treaty of Versailles and occupied
the position until his health began to fail.
That was not long ago, when Mr. Gallagher
was close to 70 years of age. I knew him
very well and I learned from him of the
difficulties encountered by himself and the
members of his department, about whom he
always spoke so highly.
The honourable Leader of the Opposition
made reference to my remark to the effect
that pressure is liable to be put on a minister
of the Crown as distinct from a semi-judicial
body. I agree that the learned leader might
never have been subjected to such pressure,
for I know that his stature and honesty are
such that evil would not come close to him.
However, in justification of the opinion I
expressed in my speech, I will read a paragraph from the Fauteux report:
we are firmly of the opinion that the parole
authority for Canada should be a quasi judicial
body rather than as is presently the case, a minister of the Crown acting in an exclusively administrative capacity. The parole authority, we believe,
should not be one that is liable to be subjected to
the external and internai pressures which are,
inevitably, brought to bear on ministers of the
Crown. We have no reason to believe that such
pressures exert any influence in connection with
the granting of tickets of leave at the present time.
However, we do believe that it is in the best
interests of Canada that the parole authority
should, at ail times, be in a position to say that
its judgments can only be based on the merits of
the particular case and that it is not open, in any
way, to influence by extraneous considerations.

Those were guarded and respectful words,
with which I agree. I said that it is better
that the authority and discretion to grant
parole should be in the hands of a semijudicial body than in the hands of a minister,
and in saying that I only have in mind that
ministers are in public life and politics and
are likely to be bothered by people who think
they should make this or that representation,

which may sometimes be for the benefit of a
prisoner who does not deserve it.
I also wish to congratulate the honourable
gentleman from Toronto-Spadina (Hon. Mr.
Crol) upon the interest he always brings into
a discussion, especially when there is some
aspect of social welfare to be dealt with, and,
while they may not be directly connected
with a bill under study, his remarks are
always very interesting.

EMERGENCY GOLD MINING ASSISTANCE
BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. W. M. Aseltine moved the second
reading of Bill C-53, to amend the Emergency
Gold Mining Assistance Act.
He said: Honourable senators, my explanation of this measure will be brief, for the
bill consists of only one or two paragraphs.
The purpose of the bill is to extend the relief
and assistance provided under the act to
the years 1959 and 1960. It goes further and
provides for a 25 per cent increase in the
amount of assistance for the years 1958, 1959
and 1960. This legislation was forecast in the
budget speech.
Since World War II our northern communities, which depend on the gold mining
industry to a great extent, have been having
a difficult time of it. In 1941 the production
of gold in Canada reached an all-time high
of 5.4 million ounces, but by 1945 production
had declined to 2.7 million ounces. This was
because we were at war and all labour and
supplies were diverted to the war effort. As
a result, labour in these northern areas where
the gold was principally produced was at
a low point and production fell rapidly.
However, from 1946 to 1950 there was some
recovery, but in the meantime the price of
gold in Canadian dollars dropped from $38.50
per ounce to $35 per ounce. Consequently, the
northern communities were adversely affected; many mines had to close down and
others carried on their operations at a considerable loss.

The original Emergency Gold Mining Assistance Act was passed in 1948. It might be
of interest to honourable senators to know
that no assistance is given under the act
unless the average cost of producing one
ounce of gold exceeds $26.50; and only mines
with a gold production of 70 per cent of the
total production of the mine are able to get
any assistance. Assistance given to any one
mine applies to only two-thirds of the number of ounces of gold it produces. The
assistance payment is arrived at by multiplying the number of ounces eligible for assistance by two-thirds of the amount by which
the average cost of producing an ounce exceeds $26.50.
The increase of 25 per cent applies from
January 1, 1958 and extends to the end of
the year 1960, and the period of the application of the act is extended to the years 1959
and 1960. Final figures for 1957 are not yet
available. In 1955 the sum of $8.9 million
was paid out under this act by way of assistance. In 1956 the figure was $8.7 million.
For 1958 it is estimated that the amount
required will be approximately $12 million.
Honourable senators may also be interested
to know that the total amount paid out under
this act during the past ten years by way
of assistance to the gold mining industry
is $108.8 million. If the act is not extended
past the end of 1958 it is estimated that 20
gold mines will have to close down in due
course, and these mines would no doubt remain closed permanently. Many other mines
would also be adversely affected. In my
opinion, this would be most detrimental to
those northern communities that I have previously mentioned, which depend almost
entirely upon the production of gold.
Honourable senators, that is a brief explanation of the bill.
Hon. A. Neil McLean: Honourable senators,
I shall be glad to support the bill; it is very
good as far as it goes.
I wish to make a few comments on the
Canadian gold mining industry. I am not
personally interested in gold mining but I
know the function that gold fulfils in the
world markets. I think we should find a
better way to support the gold mining industry than by means of this bill. No gold
mines of any consequence have been opened
up in Canada since World War II, nor under
present circumstances do I think there will
be. Gold is about the only important commodity selling at pre-war prices that I know
of, while mining costs have gone up at least
50 per cent. The United States price is
dependent on the discount on the American
dollar, which is continually going up and
down. That is not very good for stability so

SENATE
far as the selling of gold is concerned. When
I speak of the price of gold, I mean domestic
gold. We have hoarded millions and millions
of domestie gold on Wellington street since
the last war, paid for with paper money at
an uneconomic price. If we are obliged to
sell any gold in the world markets we should
take our losses when we come to them. In
our north country, hardrock miners who go
down into the earth are not getting as much
per hour as many handy men get in our
cities, because the mines are not earning
enough to pay more. In my opinion the price
of gold is bound to be raised in due course.
It is the old story, that you cannot keep
building a structure higher and higher unless
you go back and strengthen the foundation.
Well, if gold is the foundation of our credit
system and the nations keep on piling up
debts, it is only a question of time until the
price of gold will rise. I do not think that
will be in the too far distant future, because
all free nations realize that on account of
the many depressed countries of the world
we have to create more credits. If the Government sees its way to put a floor on the
price of gold, as it has done on other commodities, ultimately it will get its money
back several times over, if the price of gold
is raised as it was raised previously.
Hon. Joseph A. Bradetie: Honourable
members of the Senate, in 1954 and in 1956
I had the honour to present a bill similar
to this one, and it was passed unanimously
in this assembly.
I want to compliment the Leader of the
Government (Hon. Mr. Aseltine) on the way
he presented this bill. Not only does he know
a lot about wheat but he knows a lot about
gold mining, and I certainly compliment him
for that.
I am in favour of this new measure, which
is really a very simple amendment to the
act. The formula that has been applied for
approximately the last four years will remain
the same, and in calculating assistance the
Department of Mines and Technical Surveys
will simply add 25 per cent to the payment
calculated under the present formula. This
is really a substantial increase and I am
happy to congratulate the Government upon
having decided to amend the act in this way.
I want to deal for a few moments with
the gold mining situation. However, I am
not going to quote any statistics, because
the Leader of the Government in explaining
the bill has already given us some statistics
which are very revealing.
The increase of the subsidies under the
Emergency Gold Mining Assistance Act is
undoubtedly well received by the gold mining industry. While it is true that cost aid

is not to be considered as a satisfactory
substitute for the higher price which many
authorities believe they should be paid for
gold, and remembering that the yellow metal
is still regarded as essential to the economy,
the present act is a great factor of stability
for that industry in time of continuing stress.
Lately some very strong arguments have
been advanced for higher gold prices. There
is no doubt that gold mining communities
would feel greatly relieved if the price of
the yellow metal was set somewhere between
$40 and $45 per ounce. This subject of a
higher price for gold was the basis of a
submission by W. F. Lougheed Associates to
the Minister of Finance, the Honourable
Donald Fleming, early last May at Ottawa.
The report was made on behalf of the Timmins Industrial Commission, an organization
that had the wholehearted support of other
mining centres of the north for a drastic
revision of the gold subsidy.
At this point I want especially to pay special
tribute to the Daily Press of Timmins, the
Northern News of Kirkland Lake and the
Financial Tines of Toronto for the way they
have campaigned during the last few years
in keeping the gold mining problem in front
of the Canadian public. It can safely be said
that those newspapers have been of great
assistance in directing toward the gold mining industry the attention it bas received
from the Govenrnent.
The present method of subsidizing the mines
has never been entirely satisfactory. At best,
the Emergency Gold Mining Assistance Act,
like all Government subsidies, has been a stopgap. The mines and the communities which
depend on the operation of the act for their
economie existence have never been certain
of its duration. Some mines would have gone
under long ago without subsidies paid under
this act, while others would have carried on
with a very thin margin of profit and a very
few of the more profitable ones would have
been able to carry on.
However, it must be remembered that this
act was not brought into force solely for the
benefit of the mines. The Government had
people in mind-the residents of towns like
Timmins, Schumacher, South Porcupine,
Kirkland Lake, Rouyn-Noranda, to mention
a few gold mining centres in Northern Ontario and Quebec, and leaving out other
centres in British Columbia. These, in a
word, represent all the gold mining sections
of Canada, the residents of which had invested their energies, talents and money in
their respective communities. Without the
Emergency Gold Mining Assistance Act these
places would have suffered, and indirectly the
whole of Canada would have suffered too.

AUGUST 20, 1958
A price of $45 Canadian for an ounce of
gold would be more in keeping with mining
conditions as they are today. Everyone
familiar with gold mining knows that this
would be a reasonable price, when the prices
that are being paid for all other metals are
considered. However, honourable senators,
there is one flaw in the submission, at least
from a Government standpoint. A price of
$40 to $45 an ounce would cost the Canadian
taxpayers upwards of $20 million per year as
against $12.5 million which it is estimated will
be the amount paid out under the bill before
us. In relation to the federal budget, however,
this is a comparatively minor sum. It is not
difficult to predict what would happen if the
$45 price were adopted. The better-off mines
would elect to accept it and forgo cost aid
under the Emergency Gold Mining Assistance
Act. Even the borderline mines, which require assistance to survive, would certainly
take advantage of the new price too.
The International Monetary Fund would
continue to control the world price of gold,
and that price would continue to be $35 an
ounce in United States funds, unless the
monetary organization agreed to revise it.
Canada would have to accept the lower figure
for any international gold transactions, but
this fact should be no bar to a more generous
domestic price.
The gold mines, which are an integral part
of our economy, have been regarded too long
as the stepchildren of the nation's industrial
life. The Lougheed formula is worth considering. It would place all the gold mines
on an independent footing financially and
assure a much brighter future to all the gold
mining communities of our country. Those
who are familiar with the gold mining industry know that nearly 18,000 people are
directly employed in exploiting the mines and
that it is the main support of more than
80,000 people, who reside in the gold mining
communities. Realizing this, one can easily
imagine the effect upon the industrial centres
of Canada such as Hamilton, Toronto, Montreal, Winnipeg, Vancouver and Victoria if
anything were to happen to that industry.
During the last few months there have
been quite a lot of stirrings about gold.
The glitter of that precious metal is presently dazzling the stock market. For the
first time in about a decade promoters are
touting, and investors have been buying gold
stocks. It would seen that the all-time
favourite glamour stock is back in business.
But it must be remembered that a flash in
the pan does not make a profitable gold
mine. Nor does the chatter of tickers nor
well-publicized wishful thinking make a
sound gold market. That fiurry of gold

stock speculation might well have been
caused by well-timed and well-publicized
pressure which started last fall when it was
rumoured that the United States Treasury
was about to increase the price of gold to
$45 an ounce. Some even thought that the
price would be set as high as $60 an ounce.
In this regard, we all know that the United
States is the major market for North American gold producers and in addition is the
only nation capable of raising the price of
gold.
The fairly strong market for gold stocks
was also probably accentuated by the hope
that our own Government will increase its
gold subsidies to the mines, which hope, at
least to some extent, bas been fulfilled in
this measure now before the Senate and
already passed by the House of Commons.
Speculation that the price of gold will
be increased is pretty much an annual affair
coinciding with the meetings of the International Monetary Fund. But this year, spurred by the United States business recession,
talk of an increase in price has been more
persistent. It is against this background that
the most active market for gold in seven
years has developed on the Toronto Stock
Exchange. In several cases prices have soared
as much as 200 per cent. Fewer than a dozen
issues show gains of less than 20 per cent.
Most gains range from 30 to 60 per cent. I
myself do not know exactly what that implies, even though I reside in the centre of
the gold mining section of Northern Ontario.
Nevertheless, I feel that such activity has to
some degree helped the gold mining industry.
From an investment point of view gold
mines which can produce and sell gold on the
open market without having to resort to
Government assistance offer the best opportunities. If the price of gold is increased they
will benefit first and foremost. Companies
receiving cost-aid would lose most, if not
all, Government assistance if the price were
increased and consequently would obtain less
benefit. All non-cost-aid mines are dividend
payers.
Personally I do not see the possibility of
an increase in the price of gold because of
the present economic situation in the United
States, although I would greatly desire to
see this happen. Even in the United States
there have been some rumours about activity
in gold mining. I have in my hand an
article which appeared in the Ottawa Journal
of August 12, written by an attractive and
talented columnist, Dorothy Kilgallen. It
reads in part:
Watch for a huge new gold rush in Canada,
with the main activity in the Norpax and Red Lake
field of Ontario. The boom was started by rumours
that Russia would back all foreign purchases with
bullion.

SENATE
I don't know just what is meant by those
words. I know the Red Lake field, but I
don't know of any great find there; nor do I
know what would be the Russian interest
in the purchase of gold.
Asked about the possibility of a change in
the 24-year-old price of gold, Britain's Prime
Minister Harold Macmillan six weeks ago
replied:
That is one of those questions it is even indecent
to ask and stili more improper to answer.

Nevertheless, the question is rapidly becoming the No. 1 topic in the world's financial
capitals, and gold itself booms as a major
new weapon in the trade war between East
and West. The economic possibilities produced a speculative fever that is sweeping
markets in London, Toronto and New York
City, pushing many gold shares to new highs.
Part of the sudden interest is due to the
United States recession. With price and production largely stabilized by Governments,
gold mining companies always grow more
attractive in periods of deflation. But far
more intriguing to speculators is the hope
that gold will be revalued for the first time
since 1934, possibly rising from $35 per ounce
to $50 or more. One of the main arguments
for the revaluation is that the United States
is losing some of its vast hoard of gold in
what appears to be a flight from the dollar.
In the last five months alone foreign purchases
have drained $1.2 billion from United States
gold stocks. If the outfiow continues at this
rate it will top $3.6 billion in 1958, a loss
greater than in either 1949 or 1954.
One immediate effect of the drain is that
it forced the Federal Reserve to ease bank
reserves by $450 million last April to counteract the tightening effect on domestic bank
reserves. A much more serious potential
effect is on the stability of the United States
dollar. The United States has total Treasury
stocks of $21.6 billion, about 67 per cent of
the free world's supply of monetary gold.
Since it needs only $11.4 billion to provide
the legal 25 per cent gold backing for the
Federal Reserve's notes and liabilities, the
United States apparently has a comfortable
$10 billion surplus. Actually, this surplus
is illusory; foreign governments and individuals increased their holdings of various
United States securities callable within one
year to a total of $13.7 billion, which leaves
the United States with a $3.5 billion "technical deficit".
Most experts scout the possibility of such
a run. Foreign governments would demand
gold only under conditions of imminent
catastrophe. "Much of the outfiow", says
George Willis, Treasury Director of International Finance, "is due to the normal

recovery of Europe."
Since 1950 Europe
has doubled its gold reserves to $8 billion,
with big gains for Belgium, The Netherlands and West Germany.
The Treasury's view of normalcy is open
to question. The switch from infiow to outfiow coincided not with the "normal recovery
of Europe" but with the United States recession. United States exports are down a
sharp 25 per cent this year, but imports are
holding steady, causing a shift in the balance
of trade. Some experts even see the accelerating conversion as a calculated campaign
to force the United States into a price boost.
True or not, there is plenty of pressure
from all sides. London's Economist calls for
a 300 per cent hike in the price of gold to
bring it in line with other increases, and
every miner hopes for a price boost to pay
rising costs and improve profits. A more
important argument for a higher gold price
is that it will help foreign trade. American
financial men argue that the world simply
does not have enough gold. South Africa's
W. J. Busschau, manager of the New Consolidated Gold Fields, Limited, and one of
the world's leading gold experts, argues persuasively that while the free-world money
supply has increased four-fold since 1938,
gold stocks are up only 40 per cent. To
make this comparatively small amount
finance the growing volume of world trade,
says Busschau, the price should be hiked,
not just by the United States, but by world
agreement so that all currencies would
remain the same in relation to one another.
The United States Government is against
any such price boost, arguing that the main
gainers would be large gold holders-the
United States, France, West Germany, Switzerland-while the losers would be the underdeveloped nations of the Middle East and
Asia, which have enough trouble as it is
earning hard currencies to buy gold.
The greatest gainer of all, no doubt, would
be Soviet Russia, with production estimated
as high as $600 million annually and gold
stocks at $8 billion. Some experts, such as
Manhattan's Franz Pick, expect the Reds to
turn their gold into an economic weapon by
using it to set up a gold-backed foreign trade
ruble. A few weeks ago rumours fiooded Wall
Street that the Russians were up to precisely
that. The advantages, said Pick, would be
tremendous, since it would give the Russians a
"respectable ruble" and make a sensational
impression on underdeveloped countries.
Regardless of what the Russians do, the
United States dollar is already getting its
roughest ride in years. And it looks as if
this will continue as long as foreign nations
fear that a budget deficit estimated at $11

AUGUST 20, 1958
billion or more next year will bring on new
inflation in the United States and inevitably
cheapen the dollar.
As a commodity, gold's position is unique
in two main ways. The first is that, like any
other commodity, it has certain clearly defined
industrial uses. But, unlike any other commodity-except, to some extent, silver-it is
used as an instrument of national policy, to
back currency. The second is that, alone of all
commodities, gold has not been allowed to
change in value with changing economic conditions. This was well stated by the honourable Leader of the Government a few moments
ago and I do not intend to repeat what he said.
There is also a school of thought that has
been advocating for quite a long period of
time that our federal Government should mint
$10 million worth of $5 and $10 gold pieces
annually for a period of ten years, that would
be bought up by the public for holding purposes, and used as gifts or kept as a kind
of security, and to be redeemable at the banks
not earlier than ten years after its issuance.
I am positive that hundreds of thousands of
people would like to possess some of that
currency.
It is often stated that there are, for instance in France, great holdings of gold,
but this is only relatively true. I have made
a study of this subject on some visits I
have made to the Old Country. The French

people attach a great sense of security to the
gold currency that they hold, and I believe
they are right in that way of thinking. I am
sure that principle would apply to a considerable extent in Canada. I well remember
that when Newfoundland entered Confederation I bought $200 worth of the silver dollars minted in Ottawa on that occasion. I
have now about $10 worth of that currency
in my possession, having given away the
balance to people who treasure them as
souvenirs.
I thank honourable members for their
kind attention, and in conclusion I wish to
repeat my congratulations to the honourable
Leader of the Government (Hon. Mr. Aseltine)
upon the way in which he presented the bill.
Bill read second time.

REPORT OF SPECIAL COMMITTEE ON LAND USE
Wednesday, August 20, 1958
The Special Committee of the Senate on
Land Use in Canada make their third report
as follows:On Thursday, June 12, 1958, the following
resolution was adopted by the Senate:That a Special Committee of the Senate be
appointed to consider and report on land use in
Canada and what should be done to ensure that
our land resources are most effectively utilized for
the benefit of the Canadian economy and the
Canadian people and, in particular, to increase both
agricultural production and the incomes of those
engaged in it;
That the committee be composed of the Honourable Senators Barbour, Basha, Bois, Boucher,
Bradette, Cameron, Crerar, Emerson, Gladstone,
Golding, Hawkins, Horner, Inman, Leger, Leonard,
MacDonald, McDonald, McGrand, Méthot, Molson,
Pearson, Power, Smith (Kamloops), Stambaugh,
Taylor (Norfolk), Taylor (Westmorland), Turgeon,
Vaillancourt, Wall and White.
That the committee have power to engage the
services of such counsel and technical and clerical
personnel as may be necessary for the purpose of
the inquiry;
That the committee have power to send for
persons, papers and records, to sit during sittings
and adjournments of the Senate, and to report
from time to time;
That the evidence taken on the subject during
the two preceding sessions be referred to the
committee.

The procedure adopted by the committee
was to call witnesses to give verbal and
written reports in their particular field of
land use. Since the hearings began in February 1957, 38 witnesses have provided a great
deal of information on the scope and problems of land use and in some cases suggestions for a more effective use of land. Those
giving evidence were senior officials of federal and provincial governments, farm
leaders, technical workers in agriculture, forestry authorities, aerial survey specialists and
engineers in land use planning, water use
and conservation. A list of these appears in
the appendix.
More than three hundred and fifty pages
of evidence were recorded and published
and in addition much reference material was
provided to the Committee by the witnesses.
THE SUBMISSIONS

It is difficult to summarize adequately the
material presented at the hearings; however,
the essence of the submissions may be stated
as follows:
Our Land.-Within the settled areas and
those to which it is believed settlement can
be extended, the soil has been developed
under either a grass or forest cover. The

latter is by far the most extensive and covers
the whole southern part of Canada except
the more arid region of the southern parts
of the Prairie provinces, the soil here being
developed under a grass cover. The forests
consisted of both the deciduous and coniferous
species of varying densities, depending upon
soil and climate. Likewise, for the same
natural reasons, the grass cover varied in
species and density.
Determinants of Land Use.-Apart from
urban sites for various purposes, in general,
agriculture provides a more profitable use
of land, than do other uses. But there are
many factors which determine the profitability of land in agricultural use. Climate, which
determines the kinds of crops that can be
grown, location in respect to markets, soil
and other physical characteristies are a few
of these factors. If, on account of any of
these factors, the productivity of an area is
so low as to preclude the possibility of establishing a healthy agricultural economy, then
for land where the soils were developed
under a tree cover, it would seem advisable
to leave in forest, or if the trees have been
cleared, an effort be made to re-establish
the forest and develop an economy based
upon the products of the forest. The same
is true of the grass lands. Unless these can
be more profitably used in cultivated crops,
such lands should remain, or be re-established, in permanent grass.
Relation of Land Use to Changing Economie
Environment-Utilization of land like other
human activities is a continual process of
adjustments. The economic environment
changes and land which at one time could
be farmed at a profit is no longer capable
of such use. The reason is not likely to be
wholly in the relatively inferior soil compared to other areas, but combined with the
location of industries eleswhere, shifting of
people, changes in demand and the introduction of new farming techniques which the
partially deserted area is not able to readily
adopt in order to compete, may account for
the emergence of marginal and submarginal
farms.
The nature of these adjustments and their
incidence vary. To some they create hardships; to others they mean gain. It is believed,
however, that national and provincial policies
can and should be established which will
coordinate and develop the application of
measures to lessen the hardships in the
adjustments and diminish the losses both
human and material.

AUGUST 20, 1958
Problem Areas in Land Use.-Already the
committee's attention has been directed to a
number of problem areas in land use by
representatives of provincial and national
organizations who have given evidence. A
few of these, common to all provinces, are
listed here:
(1) Areas, where on account of an unproductive soil, lack of markets, or absence
of non-farm employment, it is impossible to
maintain an acceptable living, without continual assistance from outside sources. These
conditions create what might be described as
rural slums. The remedy may be to assist
the occupants to locate elsewhere and the
land used in forestry and/or grazing.
(2) Areas where small inefficient farms
prevail for which there is a reasonable chance
of aiding their occupants to increase their
efficiency through facilities not presently
available to them, and thus help them to raise
their level of living.
(3) Areas of soil erosion and depletion of
fertility vary according to the contour and
character of the land, and cultural practices.
Even in more successful farming areas problems in soil erosion and the depletion of
fertility are found. While the direct responsibility for solving these problems is that of
the farmer, his circumstances may be such
that he cannot adopt effective practices and
it may be desirable to provide assistance for
him to do so.
(4) Problems in water resources and control are also problems in land use. Drainage
may be required to increase productivity,
dyking to reduce hazards from flooding; or,
on the other hand, structures to impound
water to raise water tables, or for storing
water to irrigate.
(5) From the time man commences to use
these resources for his own betterment and
that of mankind, he disturbs the balance of
nature and then arise problems of soil erosion,
fertility maintenance, flooding and decreased
water supplies, and a whole host of others
related to land and water use. In too many
cases there is a delay in the application of
corrective measures until the land becomes
noticeably less productive. Such occur even
in the better farming areas. It is in the
interests of all to assist the users of our land
into husbandry practices which maintain its
productive capacity.
Co-ordination and Expansion of Further
Study and Action.-The evidence indicates
considerable work has been done and is underway by various government departments and
also by private enterprise in the field of land
use and water conservation, both in investigational phases, (soil, land use and economic
surveys) and to a lesser extent in action

programs. It has also been represented to
the committee that the efforts have fallen
far short of what is required and moreover
there has been some duplication. A plea bas
been made for a centralized co-ordinating
agency to give encouragement and direction
in the research into land and water use
problems and in action programs designed
for their solution.
THE COMMITTEE'S JOB
It is essential that the Committee continues
to study a number of phases on the subject
of land and water use and related aspects
in production, marketing, financing, etc., for
the better informed it can become, the sounder
the judgment it can render and wiser the
decisions it can make. However, the Committee believes the task at hand is to
determine:
(1) What problems in land and water use
can be most effectively handled in an overall
national policy, and,
(2) What form of organization should be
established to give leadership to such a
national program.
It would seem that the committee's activity
should be .directed along the following lines:
Study achievements of significance in a number of existing systematic programs designed
to bring about better land and water use.
Examples are:
(1) Development of soil improvement associations by farmers themselves.
(2) Agency programs in restoring tree cover
to non-arable lands.
(3) Agency programs in re-grassing of lands.
(4) Work of River Valley Authorities of
Ontario.
(5) Work of Maritimes Marshland Reclamation.
(6) Certain phases of the work of P.F.R.A.
in Western Canada.
(7) Land use and conservation Committees
of the Western provinces.
Mechanics of Enquiry.-It would appear
advisable that at least one achievement in a
land and water use project from each province be studied. It may be advisable to study
achievements in better land and water use
in the United States and other countries, and
possibly also the experience where like projects were not so successful. It is suggested
that the procedure of such studies be as
follows:
That subcommittees be named:
(i) to study an achievement in each
province;
(ii) to visit sites of projects, and interview
provincial, municipal and local interests responsible for same.

SENATE

(iii) to prepare reports and with or without
personnel responsible for achievements, report
to the committee as a whole.
Machinery for National Leadership in
Better Land Use.-If as a result of the committee's studies, the committee is encouraged
to suggest that machinery be established on
a national scale for co-ordinating and assisting in programs designed to bring about better land and water use, the committee should
give attention to another phase of the study
in land use, and that is the nature and form
of the national machinery required. It has
been suggested by one of the national organizations appearing before the committee that
an act required for such a national undertaking should be framed to be as broad and
flexible as possible to ensure the greatest
possible co-operation with the provinces in
necessary programs.
Flexibility is important so that federal participation in provincial programs may vary according
to the manner in which provinces wish to carry
on their program and the emphasis they wish to
give to the various aspects of the land use
program.
RECOMMENDATIONS FOR ACTION OUTSIDE
OF THE COMMITTEE

While, at this time, the committee feels it
has neither covered the scope of the inquiry
on land use requested of it, nor adequately
assessed the submissions heard, nevertheless
it is prepared to recommend:
(1) That the soil survey being co-operatively carried out by the federal Department
of Agriculture, the provincial Departments of
Agriculture and the Colleges of Agriculture
be speeded up and expanded not only in
order to complete the soil mapping of the
whole settled area of Canada, but also of the
unsettled areas.
(2) That it be called to the attention of the
proper authorities the need of a systematic
land use survey based upon appropriate
factors to provide for an economic classification of the land according to its use
suitability.
(3) That the work of various agencies in
the study and management of our water resources be expanded,-specifically that relating to drainage and erosion problems,
condition of water-tables and of present and
likely future requirements.
(4) That more emphasis be given studies
which designate requirements respecting farm
size, organization and practices according to
the physical characteristies of the land and
economic conditions which prevail.
All which is respectfully submitted.
Arthur M. Pearson,
Chairman.

ADDRESS BY DR. W. KAYE LAMB
INQUIRY-QUESTION

OF PRIVILEGE

Hon. Jean-François Pouliot: Honourable
senators, I regret very much to have to rise
on a question of privilege.
When a senator asks for some information
he should have a better answer than "No
information" when the information asked
for is obtainable. I refer to the answer
which was handed to the honourable Leader
of the Government (Hon. Mr. Aseltine) with
regard to my request for the text of an
address delivered by the National Librarian
at Edmonton about precisely his own business. I find that the address which he then
delivered is much more important to the
honourable members of the Senate than the
academie speeches delivered in the other
bouse by Mr. Heuss, Mr. Macmillan and
Dr. Nkrumah. I know very well that if the
honourable Leader of the Government himself had prepared the answer he would have
drafted it in a very different manner but
it took a bold civil servant to draft the
answer, and I presume that it was drafted
by the National Librarian himself. I asked
for that speech, which it is necessary to
have in order to understand the work of the
National Library, from which we have
received the report of the National Librarian.
The answer to my inquiry was this:
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: I have the following answer
to
the
honourable
gentleman's
inquiry:
No
information.

As that speech is of the utmost importance, and as a summary of it was carried

by the Canadian Press, I must inform my
honourable colleagues by reading that summary in French, and it will be translated
into English and appear in today's issue of
Hansard. This is from La Presse, Montreal,
dated Monday, June 9, 1958. The same news
was carried by L'Action Catholique and
some other papers.
(Translation):
Edmonton, 9. (C.P.) The personages mentioned in
Canadian history are but "pale reflections" of what
they were in reality, and delay in making the
necessary corrections can be laid at the door of
administrative bodies which set themselves up as
"the protectors" of courts, legislative assemblies
and governments.

(Text):
I call attention to that accusation by the
National Librarian that "delay in making the
necessary corrections can be laid at the door
of administrative bodies which set themselves
up as 'the protectors' of courts, legislative assemblies and governments".
The article goes on to say:
(Translation):
That is the double-barrelled charge made Saturday before the Conference of Learned Societies now
meeting in Edmonton.
It was stated by Mr. W. Kaye Lamb, Curator
of the Public Archives, that the majority of
Canadians are more familiar with constitutions
and treaties than with their authors.
Speaking before the Canadian Historical Association, ha emphasized the need for good biographical
works. Existing biographies of Canadians "can be
counted on the fingers of one hand," he said.
He feels that, in most cases, short 5,000-word
biographies would be adequate.
Historical works
have to be interesting and this is possible only
if good publishers are available, added Mr. Lamb.

(Text):
Well, how is it possible for any historian
to do a good job, when that gentleman who
is the National Librarian is the deputy head
of the records committee which destroys a
large quantity of official papers?
EXCISE TAX BILL
REPORT OF COMMITTEE

Hon. Salter A. Hayden, Chairman of the

Hon. Mr. Aseltine: I ask that it stand.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: Would the Leader of the
Government (Hon. Mr. Aseltine) indicate
when he is likely ta proceed with consideration of this report?
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: I cannot tell. I may
ask to have the report referred back ta the
committee for further consideration.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: With the leave of the
Senate, I assume.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Of course.
The Hon. the Speaker: Consideration of the

ESTATE TAX BILL
AUTHORITY TO PRINT COMMITTEE
PROCEEDINGS
Hon. Salter A. Hayden presented the report
of the Standing Committee on Banking and
Commerce on Bill C-37.
The report was read by the Clerk Assistant
as follows:
The Standing Committee on Banking and Com-

merce, to whom was referred the Bill (C-37)
intituled: "An Act respecting the Taxation of
Estates", report as follows:
Your committee recommend that authority be
granted for the printing of 1000 copies in English
and 200 in French of their proceedings on the
said bill.

The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, when shall this report be taken into
consideration?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: With leave, I move that
the report be adopted now.
Motion agreed ta.
VETERANS INSURANCE BILL
THIRD READING

Hon. George S. White moved the third
reading of Bill C-34, ta amend the Veterans
Insurance Act.
He said: Honourable senators, when this
bill was being discussed on second reading the
honourable senator from Toronto-Rosedale
(Hon. Mr. Leonard) asked me a question,
which appears on page 602 of Senate Hansard,
as ta what exactly will be the effect of section
3(2) of the bill after section 10 of the act
has been repealed.
Section 16 of the insurance policy issued
under this act makes section 10 of the act,
which is being repealed, part of the policy.
That section provides that on the death of
a veteran in receipt of a pension the proceeds
of the insurance policy will be subject ta a
deduction.

The repeal by this bill of section 10 of the
act means that on every policy that comes
due after this bill becomes law there will
be no deduction. However, because there
will be coming due from time to time policies
issued prior ta or up ta the date of passage
of this bill, and these policies will contain
a provision in accordance with section 10, it
was necessary to make clear that any such
provision in a policy will be of no effect
and the beneficiary will receive the full
amount of the insurance. The purpose of
subsection 2 of section 3 of the bill is to
make this clear.
Hon. T. D'Arcy Leonard: Honourable senators, since I raised the question in the house
the other day I spoke to the honourable
member from Hastings-Frontenac (Hon. Mr.
White) and also studied the matter further,
and I am satisfied that I understand correctly what the intention of the subsection
is. I am in accord with that intention and
I am satisfied also that the subsection effectively carries it out. I was a little puzzled by the wording of the subsection, and
I still think it might have been improved,
but in view of the fact that both the intention
and the result are satisfactory I do not intend
ta debate the matter further.
Motion agreed ta and bill read third time
and passed.
HOUSING
REPORT OF FINANCE COMMITTEE ADOPTED

The Senate resumed from Monday, August
18, the adjourned debate on the motion of
Hon. Mr. Horner for the adoption of the
report of the Standing Committee on Finance
on the report of Central Mortgage and Housing Corporation for the fiscal year ended
December 31, 1957.
Hon. Wishart McL. Robertson: I was anxious, honourable senators, that the debate
on the report of the Committee on Finance
on the Central Mortgage and Housing Corporation's annual report should not conclude
until I had had an opportunity of saying
a word of commendation to the Leader of
the Government in the Senate (Hon. Mr.
Aseltine) who originally facilitated the sending of the report to the Finance Committee.
I wished also ta pay a word of tribute again
ta the skill and grace with which our late
esteemed colleague, the Chairman of the committee (Hon. Mr. Hawkins) presided over its
deliberations.
The honourable senator from Blaine Lake
(Hon. Mr. Horner), who moved adoption of
the committee's report, the honourable senator from Queens-Shelburne
(Hon. Mr.
Smith), the honourable junior senator from

SENATE
Winnipeg (Hon. Mr. Wall) and the honourable senator from Toronto-Spadina (Hon. Mr.
Croll) have referred to the report at length
and I will not detain the house to any great
extent in speaking on it. I had the honour
of being a member of the committee and I
attended as many sittings as possible,
although I was not present during the preparation of the report.
I have read the report carefully, and I think
it would commend itself as being a good report. The committee were impressed, as they
might well have been, with the work of Central Mortgage and Housing Corporation. They
noted the excellent character of the witnesses
who came before them, were gratified that
all seemed to feel that relations were good
between the corporation and the private interests, and they expressed the hope that this
situation would continue. They were pleased
with the research work of the corporation
looking to lower cost of construction and hoped
that this work would be continued and extended. They were impressed with the value
of co-operative housing and hoped more publicity would be given to its development;
they felt that municipalities had not taken
full advantage of the possibility for urban
re-development; they hoped the corporation
would encourage approved lenders to extend
greater facilities to remote areas; they felt
that, as far as practical, efforts by governmental agencies should be directed to low-cost
housing; and while they did not recommend
precisely that mortgage insurance be made
to apply to existing residential real estate,
they hoped that if, as and when that is done,
it would apply only to properties in the lowcost category.
It is to the specific subject of the shortage
of mortgage funds, the request for loans for
the building of university student dormitories,
and the request for assistance in the financing
of municipal services that I would like to
address a few observations.
I heard the representations on behalf of
the universities and the municipalities, and I
must confess that I was much impressed
with them. I felt that a good case was
made. I did not have the advantage of being
present in the committee when the question
of what attitude the committee would take
in respect to the requests was discussed, so
I do not know what was the overpowering
reason which caused the committee to make
no recommendation for the assistance of
municipalities in certain types of development, or of universities in their need for
dormitory facilities.
I suspect, however,
that, consciously or unconsciously, the members of the committee-particularly those
who have been members of the Senate for
some years-were of the opinion that the

financial obligations which the federal
Government has been assuming in recent
years should not be added to except where
absolutely necessary. Moreover, the hazard
is not unlikely that in future it will be increasingly difficult to obtain mortgage funds
except at increased interest rates, and it
probably was felt that what mortgage funds
were available should be kept for low-cost
housing.
May I say to honourable senators who have
come to the Senate recently that during
the last few years the Finance Committee
of this house, composed of members from
both sides, bas made inquiries into and
reported upon the general extent of governmental expenditure in Canada, at all levels
of government. On more than one occasion
that committee stressed the fact-and I would
remind my friends on the other side that
these warnings were not made to the present
Government but to the previous administration-that governmental expenditure in
Canada, at all levels of government, had
reached a point that might well cause serious
concern in the future. I must confess that
while those facts pertained to the general
record of the former Government, the policies
of the present Government show no greater
appreciation of the serious situation or any
more serious and resolute attempt to deal
with it.
As to the conversion loan, I do not know
what prompted the Government to set so high
an interest rate as 4 per cent. I presume it
took the advice of those who are experienced
in these matters; and of course the success
of the loan would be the consideration uppermost in the Government's mind. But the fact
is that the change represented not only about
a 50 per cent increase in interest on the bonds
that were being converted, but an increase
of about one per cent in the then going rate
on long-term money; and, however desirable
or necessary it may have been, the process
has very far-reaching ramifications in respect
to our national economic structure. One of
these, I submit, honourable senators, is likely
to have an effect on the mortgage money
available to Central Mortgage and Housing
Corporation. As I understand the operation
of that corporation, the Government loans it
money at a long-term interest rate, plus %
of 1 per cent, and the corporation administers the money, lending it to the ultimate
borrower at a considerably higher rate. The
rate of interest charged by the Government
to Central Mortgage and Housing Corporation is, apparently, adjusted every six
months. Upon the last adjustment, if I am
correctly informed, the rate charged the corporation was the prevailing long-term rate
of about 3j per cent, plus 1 of 1 per cent

AUGUST 21, 1958
carrying charge, or 3a per cent in total. On
that basis the corporation is operating, as
honourable senators know, in connection with
housing loans generally, at a rate of 6 per
cent. If, as now appears, the long-term rate
is to be set at 4j per cent instead of 3j
per cent, it could mean that the mortgage
interest rate hereafter will be 7 per cent,
not 6 per cent. I would expect the Government to do everything in its power to avoid
an increase of interest to 7 per cent. As a
matter of fact, it is not compelled to raise
the rate on loans to the corporation. Any
material reduction of that charge would
greatly improve housing prospects and building costs. On the other hand, if the increase
is not made, one of two things must happen:
either the margin of Central Mortgage and
Housing Corporation must be cut, and its reserves interfered with, or it will be necessary
to provide subsidies from some other source.
In any event, the problem presented to the
Government is a serious one.
Honourable senators will recall from the
committee's report that witnesses were very
much concerned about the limited amount of
mortgage money available. It was suggested
that, under the leadership of Central Mortgage and Housing Corporation, a conference
should be called, with representatives of the
Bank of Canada, other banks, the Government, and all concerned, to consider what
should be done to make additional funds
available. I do not know what those concerned
have in the back of their minds as to what
could be accomplished. But I suggest, honourable senators, that any reluctance to loan
of money at 6 per cent on mortgage funds
available must have been influenced to a
greater or less extent by the fact that in the
meantime the cost of interest, as set by the
conversion loan, has gone up by one per cent.
So the Government is faced with the possibility of one of two things. If, in order to
encourage continuing building, the rate is
arbitrarily set at less than cost, as now, plus
margins, or something less than 7 per cent,
the Government immediately places itself in
an awkward position in relation to private
lenders, because it is seeking to act as a
residual lender, only lending when money
is not available from private corporations.
Consequently, any reduction by the Government of the rate below what private lenders
are prepared and willing to lend at makes a
complication, and it also interferes to a
greater or less extent with the sound financial position of Central Mortgage and Housing Corporation.
There is another angle to this matter, and
it is connected with the position of the provinces and the municipalities. Growing up in
this country of recent years, for a variety
57075-4-41

of reasons which I will not mention, has been
a very marked tendency on the part of provinces, of municipalities, and practically every
other body which needs money, to go to the
federal Government to get it. Apparently
the idea exists that there is a bottomless well
of money into which everyone can dip to pay
for what he requires. As a matter of fact,
governments themselves have facilitated this
idea, because they do not seem to have been
careful enough to draw to public attention
the inevitable consequences of such an approach. Too often applicants for grants and
subsidies have gone to the federal Government when, in my opinion, they should have
gone to the provinces, since the responsibility,
under the British North America Act, is a
provincial one.
I submit that today the provinces are in a
better position to respond to such demands
than is the federal Government. For proof,
allow me to point to the position of Nova
Scotia, New Brunswick and Prince Edward
Island, all of which are budgeting for a surplus. I suspect that the same is true of every
province. But what is the position of the
federal Government? Today it is budgeting
for a deficit of $648 million, and, like many
others, I believe that this figure is a gross
underestimate. You do not need to have any
particular knowledge of finance to know that
every item entering into federal Government
spending will be materially increased next
year, and I strongly suspect that at the same
time the revenues will fall off in some
quarters. Such financial authorities as the
Canadian Tax Foundation have suggested
that the nature of our finances indicates
there will be a larger deficit than has been
estimated for this current year. At our
present rate of progress, even assuming there
will be no further increases in governmental
revenues or expenditures, the built-in nature
of our expenses will make it impossible to
have another surplus in this country for 10
years. At the same time the provinces, as a
result of negotiations, have got themselves
into a position whereby the federal Government has guaranteed them part of their
revenues in the future. But there is no guarantee I know of that the revenues of the
federal Government are going to be kept up.
So we are faced with these complications.
In this connection I would refer to the
work the Senate Finance Committee carried
on two or three years ago. As in other
sessions, the membership of this committee
was not drawn from one party. The honourable senior senator from Winnipeg (Hon.
Mr. Haig) played a leading part, as did the
honourable gentleman from Churchill (Hon.
Mr. Crerar) and the late Senator Hawkins.
In its report the committee warned that the

SENATE
whole burden of expenditure in this country at all levels of government had become
entirely too high and that sooner or later
we would pay the price. It may be that
we are very close to that time now. As far
as government finances in this country are
concerned, before we get through there is
going to be, in the words of a very much
talked about man in American public life,
"an agonizing reappraisal".
I suggest that all Governments in Canada,
at federal, provincial and municipal levels,
should get busy and put their fiscal houses
in order. There are only two ways that I
know of to do that. One is to decrease
expenditures, no matter how difficult that
may be, and the other is to increase revenues
at the only source, taxation. That is the
problem the federal, provincial and municipal Governments have to face, and the
sooner they face it the better it will be for
all concerned.
In the meantime, I wish to say again that
the committee's report is a good one, and I
commend it to all who are interested in
matters of this kind. I do hope it will
receive the unanimous approval of the
house.
Motion agreed to.
MARITIME COAL PRODUCTION
ASSISTANCE BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. John J. MacDonald moved the second
reading of Bill C-54, to authorize certain
amendments to the agreement made under
the Maritime Coal Production Assistance Act
with The Dominion Coal Company, Limited.
He said: Honourable senators, this is
recognized to be a rather simple bill, and I
hope that I will be able to explain it
simply.
By virtue of the Maritime Coal Production Assistance Act, chapter 173 of the
Revised Statutes of Canada, the Minister of
Trade and Commerce, with the approval of
the Governor in Council, may, pursuant to
an agreement made with a coal producer
in the Maritimes, make a loan to such producer for the carrying out of an approved
project: provided that no such loan shall
exceed two-thirds of the cost of the project
as determined by the minister.
Pursuant to this act, on March 14, 1950 an
agreement was entered into to provide a loan
of $71 million to The Dominion Coal Company, Limited for the mechanization of that
company's mines in Cape Breton. The amount
to be loaned was two-thirds of the cost of the
entire mechanization project. Interest was to
be 31 per cent per annum payable every six

months on June 30 and December 31. Repayment of the principal was to commence on
June 30, 1955, and continue thereafter every
six months on December 31 and June 30, at
the rate of 30 cents per ton of coal produced
in the preceding six months.
A first payment was made on June 30, 1955,
but was based only on the tonnage produced
by the equipment purchased under the loan
agreement, and not upon all the total tonnage.
The Department of Justice ruled that the payments of principal should be based upon all
the tonnage produced by all the company's
mines, whether mechanized or not.
The company felt that this was more than
they could afford to pay at that time, since
the mechanization project was two or three
years behind schedule and all of the $7j
million had not been drawn by the company.
Accordingly, by P.C. 1956-327, the loan agreement was altered so that the company could
repay the principal, up until June 30, 1960,
on the basis of 30 cents per net ton on the
tonnage produced by the equipment purchased under the agreement, and after that
date on the basis of 30 cents per net ton on
all the coal produced from all the mines.
Early in May 1957 the company requested
the postponement of all further repayments
on the principal until June 30, 1963, since
the mechanization program was still several
years behind schedule and they still had
over $1 million of the loan to draw upon.
That is, the original loan was $71 million
and they had used up probably $61 million,
leaving about $1 million.
To date, $6,476,524.92-and we must not
forget the 92 cents-has been advanced to the
company under the loan. Of this amount,
$1,278,278.70 has been repaid at 31 per cent,
yielding $921,345.62, and, of the original
loan agreed upon, there remains a balance of
$1,023,475.08 still to be loaned. No repayments on account of principal have been made
for December 31, 1957 or June 30, 1958, the
amount in default being approximately
$750,000. No further funds have been advanced
to the company since their default in the
repayment of principal.
The present bill is the result of the renegotiation of the loan agreement with the company. It authorizes the Minister of Mines and
Technical Surveys to enter into an agreement
amending the agreement of March 14, 1950 to
provide for the postponement of the due date
of the payments due and payable under the
terms of the original agreement to a day not
later than the 30th day of June, 1963, with
effect on such day prior to the coming into
force of this act as may be agreed upon. It
also increases the rate of interest payable
on the loan to 4 per cent per annum, in lieu
of 3à per cent with effect from July 1, 1957.

AUGUST 21, 1958
This means that an amount of $6,221,721.30
would have to be repaid at an interest of
4 per cent.
Honourable senators, that is about all I have
to say on the matter just now.
Hon. Mr. Isnor: I wonder if the honourable
senator could tell us the amount of coal mined
at the time of that first payment, both in
tonnage and in dollars and cents. Also I would
like to know what the understanding was
between the company and the Government as
to the terms of the contract.
Hon. Mr. MacDonald: I would refer the
honourable senator to the Commons Hansard,
page 3744, for the answers to the questions
which were put there. I am not too sure
what the honourable senator's question was.
If he asked a straight question as to what
they had in the stockpile about ten days
ago, I can answer that by saying it was

1,400,000 tons.

Hon. Mr. Isnor: That was not the question I asked at all. I want to know what the
understanding was between the company and
the Government as to the terms, and what
the amount of coal mined at the time of the
first payment was, both in tonnage and dollars and cents.
Hon. Mr. MacDonald: Honourable senators, I am sorry I cannot answer that
question.
Hon. Donald Smith (Queens-Shelburne):
Honourable senators, I have something to
say about this bill, but first I wish to compliment my honourable friend from Queens
(Hon. Mr. MacDonald). He is a senator of
great promise for Prince Edward Island, and
he has given us a very good explanation
of this bill. I wish to thank him for his
courtesy in providing me with a copy of the
information that was furnished to him, which
has made it much easier for me to understand the bill. As a result of that information
I feel I can say, even at the outset, that I
support the proposed legislation. My honourable friend explained the bill so clearly
that I do not think it should be necessary
to refer it to a committee. I believe that all
honourable members who have an opportunity to read the record of what the honourable senator said today will receive from it
a clear understanding of the situation which
will enable them to decide, perhaps at the
next sitting, whether or not to support this
measure.
The honourable senator said this was a
simple bill. It is simple in its terms, but it
is not very simple to explain, and again
I compliment him upon giving his explanation with such clarity.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Hear, hear.
57075-4-41J

Hon. Mr. Smith (Queens-Shelburne): In
view of the fact that the honourable senator
from Queens comes from a province whose
coal resources have not yet been discovered,
so to speak, I would not expect him to have
the same background of knowledge of the
coal industry as have some of us who live
even in the southern part of the province of
Nova Scotia. Perhaps I am in a position,
therefore, to realize a little more fully than
he can some of the background, some of the
reasons, which make this bill necessary, and
which of course he would not be expected
to be in a position to state.
This bill was introduced in the other
place. I followed the debate closely, as many
honourable senators did. No member of that
house from the province of Nova Scotia took
advantage of the opportunity to speak on the
bill or to make any comments on the
problems involved. I feel that the records
of Parliament should contain some statement by some representative of Nova Scotia
on the problems of the industry which have
made this bill necessary.
If I may be permitted to do so, I will go
back ten years or more, to the appointment
of the Carroll Commission, which made a
broad study of the problems of the coal industry in this country. Some of his colleagues will remember that that commission
was headed by one who served for some
years in Parliament, and who at the time
of his appointment to the commission was
a member of the Supreme Court of Nova
Scotia. I refer, of course, to the Honourable
Mr. Justice Carroll, who, I am sure his old
friends will be glad to hear, is living a very
happy life indeed with his charming wife
in that lovely lakeside village of Baddeck,
in beautiful Cape Breton.
The Carroll Commission recommended,
among other things, that mechanization should
be undertaken in order to make the mining
of coal a much healthier industry than it
appeared to be at that time. During the
war, as I think all of us remember, there was
a shortage of fuel of all kinds, and the coal
industry was handicapped by lack of manpower. There was no difficulty at all in the
selling of coal. However, that was just a
wartime situation. The Government of that
day foresaw that difficulties would arise after
the war, and it was because of its consciousness of the problems that the Carroll
Commission was appointed. As a result of
that commission's recommendations, as was
pointed out by my honourable friend from
Queens, the Maritime Coal Production Assistance Act was passed in 1950.
The question may be asked, what has
mechanization done for the mines? I think
it has done a great deal. I would point out

SENATE

that in 1945 production in tons per man day
In 1955, after considerable
was 1.58.
mechanization had been installed, production
rose to 2.33 tons per man day. I repeat
that in 1945 production was only 1.58 tons
per man day. I am satisfied that mechanization was a large factor in that increase of
production, but I do not think all the increase
was due to mechanization. The coal miners
themselves of those years, under a very good
union leadership, realized the need of increasing productivity. I think they found
a way to work a little harder and to increase
their production per man-day by sticking to
the job and making it possible to increase
the tonnage from each mine in which the
gangs worked.
I remember very well that the Union officials recognized the importance of holding
the line in wages in order to keep coal mining
more or less on an even keel. The heads of
the unions had difficulty in persuading their
membership at that time that it was in their
own interest to hold the line. However, they
succeeded in doing so, and for the first time
in many years the union members went home
from their annual convention satisfied to go
back to work under the old contract.
Then along came a rapid increase in the
cost of living. The miners found it hard to
make both ends meet, as did a great many
other people in this country. So when the
next negotiations between the men and the
mine company came up, the men asked for
higher wages. The dispute went to conciliation, and it is interesting to remind ourselves
that one of the members of the conciliation
board who was able to use his great abilities
for compromise and to effect a compromise
settlement acceptable to the miners was our
late friend Senator Charles Hawkins.
I think it was a great piece of union statesmanship to convince the miners that they
should do their best to go along with the
mechanization program, and then hold down
their request for increased wages to the
modest limit which they did.
All through the years the Governments of
the day were quite conscious of these problems and they increased coal subventions
from time to time until now the maximum
subvention which makes it possible to move
coal to the limit of the area in Ontario is
now $5.25 per ton. I have recently read an
estimate, based on information supplied by
the Dominion Coal Board, that this amounts
to $14 per day for every miner who works
on that coal to move it up to the limit of
transportation that it reaches today.
So you can see, honourable senators, that
from time to time the Government has done
what it thought reasonable, and I think in

some cases a little more than what was reasonable, to play the part a Government must
play in order to keep the industry going.
The marketing problems continued, and of
course they worsened as the Canadian
National Railways progressed in their program of dieselization-and we must agree
that they had to dieselize. Then uneasiness
began to prevail and it persisted until 1957.
The Government of the day never did hide
the fact that the problem was serious and
also very perplexing. But just about this
time a troupe of medicine-men came down
on the scene and offered a quick cure-all,
a very enticing prescription written in very
vague language. The ingredients of this
magic cure-all appeared to include a few
stronger drops of subvention, which it was
said would result in acquisition of new
markets, and there was some new twist that
had to do with the building of thermal plants.
It all added up to a greater production of
coal and full employment in the mines. Whatever the herbs might have been in the prescription, the cure-all was gaily coloured and
sweetened with sugar and spice. Without an
opportunity to have it spelled out, to the coal
miners and those dependent on the mines for
their earnings this medicine meant one thing,
and one thing only-the way to prosperity.
The mining communities bought this prescription and bought it in wholesale quantities.
But what relief did they get when they took
the medicine? Very soon they found out that
they had on their hands a surplus of 1,400,000
tons of coal, as stated by my honourable
friend from Queens, and it bas been estimated
by this Government that by the end of this
year there will be a surplus of 1,250,000 tons,
at least. They found they had a financially
embarrassed company that had to be bailed
out, and it will be remembered that there
was legislation directed to that end not very
long ago. They also found this summer that
9,000 miners were laid off, on enforced vacation without pay, instead of enjoying the full
employment guaranteed to them by the
medicine-men. And of course there was,
correspondingly, a 300,000-ton loss in production instead of the increased production they
were led to expect from the spiel.
The company obtained another loan from
the Government to finance the stockpile, and
there was a small increase in subventions,
but they have had little or no effect on the
industrial patient.
This bill to revise the terms of the Assistance Act is evidence of the continuation of
the problems of the industry, and that the
conditions I just mentioned were not of the
kind which the mysterious prescription was
supposed to bring about for the coal mining

AUGUST 21, 1958
industry. I want to remind my honourable
friend that the policies of the former Government have not been altered by the new
administration in any substantial way, they
have simply been added to in small measure.
The magic formula was found to contain no
new ingredients. Those affected by the health
of the coal mining industry in Nova Scotia
are now putting the patent medicine they
bought on a shelf in the attic, to remind
themselves how they were taken in by the
medicine-men.
The time has come for all concerned with
the problem to make a fresh study and base
new policies on an up-to-date approach to
the economic and human problems involved,
and it is on this point that I want to say
something before I complete my remarks.
If ever there was a field for fruitful
research as to the best use of resources in
this country it lies in the coal mining industry. This truth was realized by the previous Government. I am sure we all remember the excitement that surrounded the
experiment at McGill University by Professor
Mordell on the development of the coalfired gas turbine. That experiment, which
cost a lot of money, was not a success, and
I believe it has now been practically
abandoned. But this is not the time to
stop research in this field, because the field is
wide open.
We are living in a new age, the age of
oil and gas. Tomorrow it will be the nuclear
age, with its prospects of low-cost heat and
power, which will render present measures
of assistance to the coal mining industry
completely ineffectual. We should start now
on a full-scale scientific investigation of the
possibilities of using coal for purposes other
than fuel. We remember that Germany
found many uses for the organic content
in coal and thereby was able to prolong the
last war. Research is usually expensive,
and I am sure this kind of research would
be no exception, but surely such an investigation would be worth the price of a jet plane.
Research might disclose means of expanding
opportunities of employment for the youth
of these mining communities in which many
thousands have no alternative but to go underground for the rest of their lives in order
to make a living.
It was with these possibilities in mind that
the former Prime Minister, the Right Honourable Mr. St. Laurent, warned of the wasting of a valuable resource through the
encouragement of an uneconomic overproduction. But how his words were misconstrued
and misrepresented! The members of this
chamber will, I believe, endorse this bill
but there will be much more enthusiasm
if, at an early date, we are asked to support

a measure which would result in the establishment of a research centre located in the
heart of these coal fields in Nova Scotia.
I am sure that all Nova Scotians, in common
with their fellow Canadians in other parts
of this country, would indeed be gladdened
if such research efforts resulted in finding
an economic process of extracting from our
coal resources certain organic materials
which would form a base for secondary industries and provide employment opportunities.
Hon. Gordon B. Isnor: Honourable senators,
I wish to touch briefly on this bill. I compliment the honourable senator from QueensShelburne (Hon. Mr. Smith) upon giving a
splendid background of the coal mining activities relating to the province of Nova Scotia.
He understands well the difficulties facing
the industry and I am not at all surprised
to know that he is in accord with the general
principles of the bill. I am interested in the
effect it will have on a very large proportion of the population of our province. As
honourable senators may know, mining and
quarrying employ a greater percentage of the
population in Nova Scotia, namely 5.4 per
cent, than in any other province in Canada.
Alberta ranks second, with a ratio of 2.1 per
cent, Newfoundland 2.1 per cent, and the other
provinces in the order of 1.1 per cent, 1.6
per cent, .6 per cent, .07, and so on. So, it
is apparent that the coal mining industry
is extremely important to the people of Nova
Scotia.
I very well recall when the principles of
this legislation were discussed in the early
stages. The Dominion Coal Company undertook operations in our province involving expenditures of $10 million. The company went
to the Government of the day, which proposed
to advance two-thirds of that amount by way
of loan. I point out that, unlike financial
assistance to the West by way of gift, this
was to be a loan for $7,500,000, at 3j per
cent interest.
The fact was not pointed out in the other
house, and has not previously been mentioned
in this house, that the total estimated expenditure for the operation is $13 million.
I am not aware that that amount includes the
washing plant, an important part of the coal
industry, which was estimated to cost
$3,100,000. It is said that up to the present
time only $228,516.65 has been spent in that
connection. So a substantial undertaking still
remains.
The honourable senator from Queens-Shelburne spoke of the progress made by the
miners of Nova Scotia. I too wish to pay
my tribute to them. They have in the past
been criticized for not working five days a
week-sometimes they worked only three

SENATE
days. But I would point out that coal cannot
be mined economically unless there is a ready
market for it. Some years ago the Nova
Scotia Government and the Department of
Mines came to central Canada and sold to
that area-mostly Quebec and parts of southern Ontario-something like a million tons
of coal. That market has of course substantially diminished.
As was mentioned by the honourable senator from Queens-Shelburne, the diesel loconotive was developed and a very big
customer of coal, the railway, found little
use for it. That too was a hardship for the
coal industry. However, there is one market
that has not been tapped, and it was principally to mention it that I rose to speak this
afternoon. I have a suggestion which, if
implemented, would I believe be of assistance to both the Dominion Coal Company
and the federal Government in its attempt
to assist Newfoundland. First, I would point
out to the honourable senators from Newfoundland that at the present time very little
Nova Scotia coal is being sold to Newfoundland. I do not know why that is so, but I am
under the impression it is because of transportation difficulties. My suggestion is that
the coal company might well find a profitable
market for the sale of coal to Newfoundland
in the form of briquettes or compressed coal
loaf. I feel that a market for coal in that form
could be created there.
Honourable senators, I do approve the principles of this bill, because it is beneficial to
my province.
I should like to pay my respects to the
Carroll Commission, which I recall vividly,
and to the work done by its chairman, the
Honourable Mr. Justice W. F. Carroll.
Although Mr. Justice Carroll is now retired, he is still interested in the coal industry. It is as a result of his fine work that
the province of Nova Scotia and the federal
Government were able to get together and
make the agreement which they did.
The rate of production of coal has been
increased by the program now under way.
At the present time something like 50 to 60
per cent more coal is being produced per
man per day. As has already been mentioned,
the rate in 1945 was 1.58 tons per man per
day, and it is now 2.33 tons. But that is not
good enough. I understand the production
rate has to reach something like 5 tons per
man per day to make the operation profitable.
Then of course the question arises as to
where a market can be found to handle that
volume of production.
The honourable senator from Queens (Hon.
Mr. MacDonald) who gave us a very clear
explanation of the bill, said there is now a

stockpile of 1,400,000 tons of coal. It is not
likely to be reduced to any great extent. It
is estimated that by next December 31 there
will still be a stockpile of 1,200,000 tons.
'But that is not the most important problem. I am unable to see how a market can
be found for this type of coal, which is really
coal dust, unless it can be sold in the form
of briquettes or pressed coal loaf, as I mentioned earlier.
Honourable senators, I could speak about
the raising of interest rates on Government
bonds from 3 to 4½ per cent, but I am sure
that if I did so I would be accused of talking
politics. I won't say anything about it, so as
not to be misunderstood.
Hon. Mr. Croll: You have already said it.
Hon. Mr. Isnor: The fact remains that the

FINANCIAL ADMINISTRATION
MOTION

FOR

BILL

SECOND READING-DEBATE
ADJOURNED

Hon. W. M. Aseltine moved the second
reading of Bill C-43, to amend the Financial
Administration Act.
He said: Honourable senators, the making
of amendments to the act to bring it up to
date, so as to meet present conditions, has
been undor consideration for a long time.
Practically no amendments have been made
since Confederation.
The present bill has for its objects: first,
to authorize the Treasury Board to make
regulations for the deletion from the government's books of small debts, $25 or less-a
very minor amendment; second, to clarify
the circumstances under which Governor
General's special warrants may be used and
to provide an opportunity for prompt parliamentary consideration of those warrants
when they are used; third, to permit a
Crown corporation, with ministerial approval,
to pay all or part of its money into the
Consolidated Revenue Fund, to be held for
it by the Receiver General, and to provide
for the payment of interest on moneys so
held; fourth, to make certain other technical
and consequential changes.

AUGUST 21, 1958
Ihe four amendments contained in the
bill to accomplish these objects are to sections 23, 28, 34 and 81 of the act. The bill
has particularly to do with section 28. Under
that section as it now stands special warrants may be issued (a) when accidents
occur to public works or buildings and
repairs or renewal are urgently required,
and (b) when expenditure not foreseen or
provided by parliament is urgently required
for the public good. These Governor Generals' warrants may be used only in periods
when Parliament is not in session or when
it is under adjournment sine die, or to a date
more than two weeks after the accident happens or the matter arises.
The wording of the act has been found in
some respects to be lacking in clarity. Accordingly, these provisions which are now before
us have been rewritten to simplify the
language and clarify the circumstances under
which these Governor General's warrants may
be issued. Under the present act warrants
can be used only when Parliament is not in
session or is under adjournment, when there
is no other appropriation for the service, and
when expenditures are necessary for the
public good.
The act as it stands makes provision for
an early opportunity for Parliament to consider all special warrants when they are
issued. There are two requirements to ensure
that the existence of Governor General's warrants may be known as soon as possible after
they have been issued. These to be found
in subsection (3) of section 28:
Every warrant issued under this section shall be
published in the Canada Gazette within thirty days
after it is issued, and a statement showing all
warrants issued under this section and the amounts
thereof shall be laid by the minister before the
House of Commons within fifteen days after the
commencement of the next ensuing session of
Parliament.

There is no change in these requirements,
but a new provision has been added whereby
the amounts appropriated by special warrants
shall be deemed to be included in and not
to be in addition to the amounts provided by
the next appropriation act enacted by Parliament. The effect will be that provision to
cover all such warrants will be included in
the first appropriation act submitted to Parliament in the session following the period in
which the warrants are issued, and the house
will thereby be given a full and early opportunity to consider such warrants.
Section 2 of the bill is of special interest to
the Senate. I am not going to read the
section, but I want to mention this. In 1896
Parliament was automatically dissolved by
reason of five years having elapsed since the
previous general election.

Hon. Mr. Macdonald: That was the end
of which administration?
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: The election was in 1896.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: That was the end of
the administration which preceded the administration headed by Sir Wilfrid Laurier?
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Yes. The supplies for
the new fiscal year, which at that time began
on July 1, had not been granted; and after
the election the question arose as to how
civil servants' salaries could be paid pending
the calling of Parliament and the submission to it of an appropriation bill. The new
Prime Minister requested the opinion of the
then Minister of Justice, Sir Oliver Mowatwho, by the way, sat in the Senate and not
in the House of Commons-as to whether
or not Governor General's warrants could
issue to pay civil servants' salaries. The minister replied as follows:
I think that the payment of the employees
mentioned in your letter is "urgently and immediately required" for the public good, within the
meaning of the said enactment, and that, under
the circumstances which have occurred, and the
consequent present condition of public affairs, the
Governor in Council may properly, on the reports
mentioned, order a special warrant to be prepared,
to be signed by the Governor General, for the
issue of the amount estimated to be required.

This opinion has since been relied upon
for the issue of special warrants for all
administrative expenses during general elections called before full supply for the year
has been granted.
Honourable senators, I do not intend to go
into the other amendments, for I have already
stated briefly what they are. Unless I am
asked questions with respect to the bill, I
submit that I have given a substantial explanation of the chief features in question.
Hon. John J. Connolly (Ottawa West):
Honourable senators, the Leader of the Government (Hon. Mr. Aseltine) has given a
most adequate explanation of the proposed
amendments to the Financial Administration
Act. It was particularly interesting to hear
him tell the story about the opinion given
by Sir Oliver Mowat when he was Minister
of Justice and sat in this house. Of course,
there have been legal opinions given by
other members of this chamber, but who
perhaps never reached the great heights of
the Ministry of Justice. Sometimes those
opinions have not been followed for as long
as this one of Sir Oliver's appears to have
been followed.
In connection with this bill I was reading
a publication from the office of the Auditor
General, entitled The Audit Office Guide,
copies of which have been distributed to

SENATE

honourable senators. It contains some comment on Governor General's warrants. The
issue of Governor General's warrants can
from time to time be the subject-matter of
political contention, and apparently in days
gone by it was a good deal more serious
problem than it is today. In this booklet
the Auditor General reports the following:

section 28 there is reference to the fact that

-at
one time senior Finance officers were
expected, on the day a session was to open, to
report for duty in morning dress, with top hat,
spats, et cetera. The reason was that the Governor
General's sleigh might be stopped outside the gates
to Parliament Hill while they held last-minute
warrants for him to sign.

We have come a long way since that sort
of thing took place. The same booklet, in
dealing with the question of warrants, has
this to say:

prorogued or dissolved. In other words,
under the section as it now reads can a
warrant be issued after Parliament is dis-

I am wondering whether in fact there
is now a loophole which should be regularized,
and that subsection (5) might provide not

this question now but if the bill is stood

I can put the question this way. Is the word

was originally designed to look after situa- ators, I feel that the point raised by the hontions where a public building fell down or was
damaged in some serious way. I feel that
the amendment proposed to enlarge the scope
for the issuing of special warrants, with the
safeguards that have been provided and have
been referred to by the honourable Leader
of the Government, is a very good change
and an improvement to the act.
There is one point about the new proposed
section 28 which causes me some concern.
It may be that the answer is a very simple
one but I would like to mention the point.
In this document to which I have already
referred, the Auditor General states:
The purpose of the old subsection (4) is to
provide for situations where Parliament adjourns
rather than prorogues, and the adjourrnent is for
a lengthy period.

He also says that the opinion of the
Minister of Justice upon which reliance is
placed-that is, the opinion given by Sir

Oliver Mowat in 1896-has to do with supply
for the public service.

In that opinion he

does not speak about other conditions, only
about

supply

for

of meeting

what is traditionally known as the civil
list. In the proposed new subsection (1) of

ourable senator from Ottawa West (Hon. Mr.

Connolly) is quite an important one.

I do

not want to have the bill sent to committee
unless it is necessary to do so. I was going
to suggest that the debate on second reading
be adjourned by the honourable Leader of
the Government (Hon. Mr. Aseltine), who has
the right of reply. If he can give a satisfactory answer when the bill comes before us

again, perhaps it could be given third reading
then, but if not it could be referred to com-

mittee at that time.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: The suggestion is that

I adjourn the debate now?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Yes.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: I will do that.
Hon. Saller A. Hayden: Just beffore the hon-

ourable Leader of the Government adjourns
the debate, may I say a word or two?

My

remarks are solely for the purpose of clarification with respect to the point raised by
the honourable gentleman from Ottawa West
(Hon. Mr. Connolly). I notice that the language following the use of the words "under

AUGUST 21, 1958
adjournment" seems to write the definition
for the word "adjournment", because it says:
Parliament shal be deemed to be not in session
when it is under adjournment-

I am omitting the words "sine die"-or to a day more than two weeks after the
day the Governor in Council made the order
directing the preparation of the special warrant.

So that appears to be the kind of adjournment that is intended by this section of the
act. Frankly, it puzzles me to relate that
kind of an adjournment to a prorogation of
Parliament when Parliament is not adjourned
to any fixed date and the people have to
elect another Parliament. That is what
bothers me in the interpretation of the section,
and I think it should be drawn possibly in
a broader form for that reason.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Aseltine, debate
adjourned.
PRIVATE BILL
BURRARD INLET TUNNEL AND BRIDGE
COMPANY-COMMONS AMENDMENTS
CONCURRED IN

The Senate proceeded to consideration of
the amendments made by the House of Commons to Bill S-4, respecting The Burrard
Inlet Tunnel and Bridge Company.
Hon. Paul H. Bouffard moved concurrence
in the amendments.
He said: Honourable senators, on behalf
of the honourable senator from Vancouver
(Hon. Mr. McKeen), who sponsored the bill,
may I say just a few words. The purpose of
the bill was to authorize the shareholders
of the company to pay a dividend to the
directors of the company. The original bill
used the word "shall" in respect to the
paying of remuneration to the directors and
the reimbursement of their travelling and
living expenses. The Commons amended the
bill by deleting the word "shall" and substituting the word "may". The company is
perfectly satisfied with the word "may".
Motion agreed to.
INCOME TAX BILL
SECOND

READING

Hon. Gunnar S. Thorvaldson moved the
second reading of Bill C-39, to amend the
Income Tax Act.
He said: Honourable senators, Bill C-39
contains amendments to the Income Tax
Act, which are made each year. It is a
lengthy bill of 31 pages and contains 43
sections. Some of its substance was referred
to in the budget resolutions presented in the
other place on June 17 last, but it contains
also a number of important changes which
were not then referred to in the resolutions.
57075-4-42

May I say that while I am sponsoring this
bill on the second reading, nevertheless I
quite confess that I lay no special claim to
any unusual knowledge on this subject, and
I think all senators are aware that the
subject of income tax is frequently technical
and difficult legislation. As this bill is essentially "bits-and-pieces" legislation, amending and rewriting, as it does, various sections and subsections of the Income Tax
Act, it is somewhat difficult to determine just
how comprehensive an explanation of the
proposed legislation should be made in this
house at the present time. However, knowing all too well that income tax has an
enormous impact on nearly every Canadian,
this subject must be treated with a great
deal of respect and, indeed, care.
Now, in speaking on this annual Income
Tax amending bill I think it is true to say
that for a long time most taxpayers have
looked upon the architect of these annual
amending bills as a person with a cold glass
eye whose only thought was to close every
little avenue of comfort and convenience to
the taxpayer. One would sometimes think
that even the gift of a Christmas turkey by a
grateful employer to an unsuspecting employee was being watched and noted by the
taxing authority at Ottawa. On the other
hand, I think I have observed in more recent
years a more conciliatory attitude on the part
of the taxing authority, at least toward the
small taxpayer in this country; and I do feel
that the present bill in many respects justifies this point of view, because in many
instances the effect of the amendments is to
ease the position of the average taxpayer.
I would like to say one thing more in
regard to income tax administration in this
country, and that is this: in my experience
the officials in the district offices across
Canada are as able and devoted public
servants as one can find anywhere, and if
dealt with fairly and above the table they
try their very best to carry out their duties
without unnecessary harshness to the average
taxpayer. When I speak in this vein I naturally refer especially to the district office
where I live, namely, in the city of Winnipeg.
And I would like to reiterate that I have a
very high regard for the ability, integrity
and courtesy of both the heads and the other
staff of the income tax office in my city.
I have no reason to doubt that the same
condition applies throughout Canada generally in the administration of the Income
Tax Act.
For the reason that this bill will no doubt
be carefully examined section by section
in committee, I do not propose to deal with
it in that manner. Rather, I have divided it
into as few general classifications of subjectmatter as possible.

SENATE

The first of the classifications I shall deal
with is loans to shareholders. When a
corporation has made a loan to a shareholder,
other than under specified circumstances, and
the loan has not been repaid by the end of
the following year, the shareholder is deemed
by section 8(2) to have received a dividend
equal to the amount of the loan. In the past
no relief was provided if the shareholder
subsquently repaid the loan. In future, when
an individual shareholder or a personal
corporation is deemed to have received a
dividend from a company by virtue of this
section, he will not be entitled to a 20 per
cent dividend credit in respect of the deemed
dividend, but he will be entitled to deduct
any amount repaid on the loan in computing
his income for the year in which the repayment was made, so long as the repayment
was not part of a series of loans and repayments.

The next classification that I want to
refer to relates to holding company expenses.
A new provision was introduced in 1957 to
permit a holding company to deduct from
income expenses which would otherwise be
non-deductible as having been laid out to
earn exempt income as in the form of
dividends from its subsidiaries. In order to
qualify for deduction it was required that
more than 50 per cent of its property consist
of shares in the capital stock of subsidiary
companies.
This requirement has been
amended so that a holding company will
qualify if 50 per cent of its property includes
investment in subsidiaries in the form of
bonds, debentures, mortgages, hypothecs, bills
or notes as well as shares of capital stock.
In other words, the relief intended here is
this: many of these holding companies hold
less that 50 per cent of their assets in common stocks, and consequently they were not
qualified for deduction even if they held
other types of securities of the subsidiary
companies, namely, other than common
shares.
I will now refer to the method of computing income. Section 14(1) of the act is
to be repealed. This section required both
the minister and the taxpayer to continue to
compute income in accordance with the
method used in previous years so long as the
taxpayer had not adopted some other method
with the minister's concurrence. With the
repeal of this section, neither the minister
nor the Income Tax Department will be
bound by a statutory rule of consistency in
the method used to compute income from one
year to the next.
Farm losses. This item may be said to
refer largely to the hobby farmer. In the
past, where the taxpayer's chief source of
income did not include farming he was

entitled to deduct only one-half of his farming loss, computed without taking into account any capital cost allowance, up to a
maximum of $5,000. That is one-half. In
future, capital cost allowance may be claimed
in computing a farm loss and the loss will be
deductible up to $2,500 plus one-half of the
excess of the loss over $2,500, with a maximum of $5,000 in a year. Therefore the
maximum deduction will be reached when
the farming loss reaches $7,500. This legislation is clearly an important concession to the
hobby farmer.
The next item is that of lease-options.
The provisions dealing with lease-option
agreements, under which the lessee has a
right to acquire the leased property, have
been completely rewritten. The new rules
are applicable for 1958 and subsequent taxation years to both new and existing leases.
The new provision sets out specifie rules
to deal with cases where both depreciable and
non-depreciable property is leased, and with
cases where the property may be acquired
by the lessee at more than one date during
the term of the agreement. It also provides
that where the lessor and lessee are not
dealing at arm's length, the capital cost at
which the lessee is deemed to have acquired
the leased property will be restricted to the
capital cost of the property to the lessor.
Charitable donations. The maximum deduction for charitable donations made by a
corporation is to be increased from 5 per
cent to 10 per cent of income for 1958 and
subsequent taxation years.
Medical expenses.
The list of medical
expenses qualifying for deduction has been
expanded to include eye glasses, almost all
prescribed drugs and a number of other
items.
Business losses. In the past losses sustained by a taxpayer in carrying on a
business could be carried back one year or
forward five years and applied against income from the business in which the loss was
sustained. The loss could, of course, be used
to offset any other income in the year it was
sustained. In future a business loss may
also be applied against the taxpayer's income
from any other business in the previous year
or succeeding five years. This will apply to
the 1958 taxation year to permit deduction of
losses incurred in another business in the
previous five years. An exception to this
new privilege is made in the case of corporations where more than 50 per cent of the
shares have been acquired by new shareholders. In such case the loss may be carried
forward only if the corporation continues to
carry on the business in which the loss was
sustained. Honourable senators can readily

AUGUST 21, 1958
see that were it not for the restriction referred to it would be quite easy to purchase
companies that have incurred losses and then
get the benefit of such allowable deductions.
Profit sharing plans. I must say that when
one comes into the sections of the Income
Tax Act dealing with profit sharing plans,
registered saving plans and so on one enters
into a very technical subject indeed. In the
past, employees were deemed to have received as dividends eligible for the 20 per
cent tax credit their pro rata share of such
dividends received by a profit sharing plan.
In the future each employee will be deemed
to have received such part of the dividend
income of the plan for the year as is allocated
to him by the trustee. Thus it will be possible for the trustee to avoid allocating part
of the 20 per cent dividend credit to those
employees who would not benefit from it.
Registered retirement saving plans. Section
79B has been amended to permit registration
of a retirement savings plan which provides
for a reduction in the annuity payable following the death of the annuitant's spouse. As
presently drafted, this provision does not
appear to permit reduction in the annuity
payable to the annuitant's spouse in the event
of the annuitant's prior death. The plan may
also provide for commutation of the annuity
payable to the annuitant's spouse following
his death.
Designated surplus. The only change made
in the designated surplus provisions is in an
amendment to section 28 (9a) to make less
restrictive the conditions under which one
subsidiary company may acquire control of
another subsidiary of the same parent company without giving rise to designated
surplus.
Deductions for oil and gas producers. Oil
and gas producers will in future be permitted
to deduct payments to the Crown for licences,
permits and reservations, other than rents
or royalties, under the same conditions as
apply to lease bonuses. In order to qualify
for such a deduction it will no longer be
necessary that the property be abandoned
before obtaining any productionso long as
production has not been obtained in reasonable commercial quantities. It will, however,
be necessary to have abandoned the entire
rights to all of the properties covered by
such payments without consideration in order
to qualify for the deduction.
Trusts and estates. Rental income from
real property is not subject to investment
surtax, whether received directly by a taxpayer or through a trust or estate. It is
now provided that the part of the income of
a beneficiary from a trust or estate that may
be regarded as rental income will be the
part of the rental income of the trust or
57075-4-421

estate for the year that is allocated to him
by the trustees. In future, trusts and estates
will not be entitled to claim the standard
deduction of $100 from income subject to tax
in the hands of the estate itself.
A non-resident trust will no longer be able
to deduct from its income subject to Canadian
tax, payments made to non-resident beneficiaries. This provision will prevent avoidance
of tax on income earned in Canada by a
non-resident through a trust established outside Canada.
Appeals. Appeals to the Exchequer Court
will be facilitated by the elimination of the
requirement that security for costs in the
amount of $400 be given. As is well known
today, in order to appeal a decision of the
Tax Appeal Board to the Exchequer Court
of Canada the appellant is required to post
security in the Exchequer Court in the amount
of $400. In future only a filing fee of $15
will be required.
The name of the Income Tax Appeal Board
has been changed to Tax Appeal Board, since
it will also be handling appeals in connection
with the new Estate Tax Act.
Personal Exemption. In addition to the
basic exemption of $1,000, a married taxpayer is entitled to an exemption of $1,000,
less the excess of his spouse's income over
$250. At present this additional exemption
is eliminated when the spouse's income
reaches $1,000. In future the additional exemption will not be completely eliminated
until the spouse's income reaches $1,250. I
think that amendment will produce more
equity in the exemption to which a taxpayer
is entitled, in a case where the wife has
income in excess of $1,000.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: Previously they were
giving it and taking it away.
Hon. Mr. Thorvaldson: Yes.
Application for refund. The time allowed
for applications for a refund of tax has been
extended fron two years from the date of
overpayment or notice of assessment to four
years from the end of the taxation year. In
addition, interest allowed on overpayments
of tax will be increased from 2 per cent to
3 per cent.
Non-resident owned investment corporations. The exemption from non-resident tax
on dividends paid by a non-resident owned
investment company will no longer apply
until the surplus accumulated in years when
the company was not a non-resident owned
corporation has been paid out by dividends.
Gift tax. Incidentally, this is a subjectmatter over which there was some debate in
the other place within the past few days.
Gifts to a spouse of real property to be used
by the husband and wife together as their

made during the period before the option
was exercised, because under the law at present those payments, though they take on the
character of rent, are supposed to be payments on account of the purchase price and
therefore not deductible. In this case they
may be treated as rent.
There is one comment I wish to make on
the question of accounting methods, to which
reference has been made. There is a provision
that if you provide for the method which
seems to be the original one, you are stuck
with it and cannot change it without the
consent of the minister. That section has
been repealed. But I suggest that the effect
of the repeal appears to be that the appropriateness of any particular accounting method
will depend on the judgment of the Department of National Revenue. The taxpayer
will be free to adopt a new method of computing income, subject to proof that the new
method is more appropriate in the circumstances of the particular case than the old
method. It may achieve greater flexibility in
one direction, but it will expose you to a
challenge at any time that it is not, under
the circumstances, the appropriate method;
and of course the minister has the right to
challenge it at any time after this section
is repealed.
I should like to say a word about the gift
tax provision. There bas been some looseness in speaking of the permission whereby,
once in a lifetime, a man can give his spouse
$10,000. The gift must be in the form of
real estate and can be made only once. I
stress that fact in view of discussion which
took place in committee in relation to
another bill, and because the nature of that
discussion may have led some people to the
conclusion that the Income Tax Act permits
a gift of $10,000. The form of the gift, I
repeat, is limited to real estate, and it must
not have a value in excess of $10,000.
I do not know whether this has been
mentioned, but it is of significance that the
ceiling on corporation charitable donations is

raised in this bill from 5 per cent to 10
per cent of the income of the corporation.
A clarification bas been made in connection
with a husband's exemption where his wife
has income. It is quite proper, but the
manner in which it exists, is, I think, a sort
of Indian giving.
As to pension contributions, the honourable senator who preceded me referred to
one phase of the extension of the provisions
in this respect. There is only one point to
which I want to make some reference. In
the act as it stands there is a provision for
an employer to add to the superannuation
fund and to make contributions in excess of
the amount which he has contracted to give
and in respect to which he is entitled to an
exemption or deduction from income tax.
That provision has been in the statute for
a number of years, and it enables an
employer to move on the strength of the
production of a statement of a recognized
actuary that the fund, to be actuarially
sound and to take care of all the obligations
that devolve on it, requires an additional
contribution. Under the existing law the
right to deduct was at the rate of 1/10 of the
amount a year, so that the deduction was
spread over ten years. When this bill becomes law the deduction may be a lump
sum deduction in the year in which it is
paid; and it is also provided that, in respect
of these ten annual instalments of deduction,
if lump sum contributions have been made
in the past, and if any part still remains
to be deducted, the balance of that lump
sum may be taken into the one year and
written off against the profits of the year.
I think that is a very valuable concession,
and that it lends strength to the statement
which I and others have made in the course
of the debate, in the last week or so, indicating the regard, even in such circles as
the Income Tax Division and the Department of Finance, to the importance and the
high place that pension plans occupy in the
economic scheme of things in Canada. If
there were any doubt or question about it,
here one finds, by Government legislation,
a proposal to assist, by immediate tax deduction, contributions by employers over and
above the amount that they would be called
upon to contribute by virtue of the superannuation plan, in order that that plan may
be put and maintained in an actuarially
sound position. Once one finds that degree
of importance attached to this matter, I
submit that one can draw many logical and
reasonable conclusions when approaching
the consideration of an attack on or any
sort of challenge to the sanctity of the fund
and the moneys which are paid out of it.

SENATE
There is just one other thing I think I
should refer to. Last year, I believe, rental
income was taken out of the category of
investment income subject to surtax. Income
tax authorities have now caught up with
us, and, if rental income is to be in the
category of general income, by a clause in
the present bill it is provided that one cannot deduct from investment income losses
in respect of property on which one receives
rental income; they must be deducted from
the income from that source.
There may be other features that require
particular explanation, but the transactions
are highly technical and, in the complicated
way of financing and carrying on many business enterprises today, situations develop that,
in the interest of fairness, require certain
treatment. The methods that are laid out for
doing it in the statute require considerable
reading and sometimes cover pages to accomplish what looks to be a simple objective.
But apparently all these words are necessary.
I would not attempt to burden the Senate
in describing, for instance, all the procedures
involved in dealing with the amalgamation
of corporations, where it is permissible, without running into tax levies, to deal with the
locked-in surpluses of the various companies
that are being merged. I believe it takes
several pages in the bill to deal with this
subject, but according to my reading of it
I think it will work.
Hon. Mr. Thorvaldson: I think it covers
seven pages.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: Yes. I would not even
be able to express what I have gleaned after
one reading of the section, even with the
background of some training and exprience
I have had, but it is beneicial and therefore
I am certainly in favour of the provision as,
indeed, I am in favour of most of the provisions contained in the bill this year.
Again may I commend the manner in which
the sponsor of the bill (Hon. Mr. Thorvaldson)
gave his explanation. I much prefer that sort
of explanation, where you deal in headings
and in simple language with the scope and
effect of a bill of this kind, to an attempt at
an itemized and detailed discussion of each
section. That way one gets lost in a maze
of language and ends up having no appreciation of it at all.
Hon. Mr. Taylor (Wesimorland): There is
one question I should like to ask the sponsor
about section 5 of the bill. I understand that
under the existing act a farmer is permitted
to deduct one-half of his total farming loss
in one year up to an amount of $5,000. Then
I understand that section 5 of the bill proposes
that a farmer may deduct with respect to his
farming loss for one year an amount of

$2,500 plus one-half of any loss in excess of
$2,500, but that in both cases the maximum
is the same. Am I right in that? I thought
I understood the sponsor to say that a farmer
can deduct up to $7,500?
Hon. Mr. Thorvaldson: I think the explanation is this. At the present time if you have
a loss up to $2,500 you can deduct that amount.
If you have a further loss of $5,000, you have
an additional deduction of $2,500, namely,
one-half.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: That is right.
Hon. Mr. Thorvaldson: In other words,
your total deduction under this amending bill
is increased to $5,000. If you have a farm loss
of $7,500 you have a maximum deduction of
$5,000. If your loss is $10,000, your maximum
deduction is still $5,000. I believe that is the
case.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: I understand the improvement in the bill is that you get the first
$2,500 of loss.
Hon. Mr. Baird: Do I take it this concerns
what are called "gentlemen farmers"?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: Hobby farmers.
Hon. W. Ross Macdonald: Honourable senators, I would like to join with the honourable
gentleman from Toronto (Hon. Mr. Hayden)
in congratulating the honourable senator from
Winnipeg South (Hon. Mr. Thorvaldson) on
the able presentation which he has made of
this bill. I like the way he presented it. He
dealt with the principle of a difficult piece
of legislation under separate headings. Whenever a bill is going to be referred to committee, I feel that this is the appropriate way
in which the bill should be discussed in the
house on second reading.
There is just one feature to which I would
like to draw the attention of the house. Probably this is a matter which could more appropriately be brought up in committee. It has
to do with the gift of $10,000 which one can
make to his or her spouse or child, and which
will not be subject to gift tax. Section 41(1)
(ba) of the bill reads:
-a
gift to the spouse or child of the donor of
an interest in real property made by way of a
transfer, assignment or other disposition of that
property to the spouse or child, as the case may
be, either alone, or jointly or in common with the
donor,

And these are the words in which I am
interested.
-to be used,
(i) in the case of a gift to the spouse,
place of residence for the spouse-

as a

My question to the sponsor of the bill is

this. Let us suppose that an interest in property to the extent of $10,000 is given to a

AUGUST 21, 1958
spouse, and within a brief time thereafter,
maybe a week or a month, the real property
is sold and no longer used as the residence
of the spouse. Is there any gift tax? I am
assuming that the property has not been used
as a residence for, say, more than a week
or a month. Or it might happen that the
house is sold and another residence purchased with the proceeds. Would the $10,000
gift with respect to the new residence be
exempt from gift tax?
The final question that occurs to me is this.
From what time does this gift tax take effect?
I notice that subsection 2 of section 41 of
the bill says:
This section is applicable to the 1958 and subsequent tax years.

If the gift was made in 1957, would there be
a release from the gift tax in that respect?
As I have said, these questions might better
be raised in committee but I thought I would
mention them now.
Hon. Mr. Thorvaldson: I would like to say
to the honourable Leader of the Opposition
(Hon. Mr. Macdonald) that his questions in
regard to this section are most pertinent and
I would not presume to try to answer them
because I have not got the answers. The
language used definitely indicates that the
section requires explanation, and perhaps we
could discuss this further in committee.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: I might suggest that
there are a number of problems inherent in
this. For instance, if such a gift tax applies
within three years of the death of the person
who makes the gift, what is the status of
this gift in relation to the subsequent probate
of the will and the inclusion of this as part
of the estate of the deceased?
I can see
that if the gift took the forrn of a joint
tenancy, that part of it, the interest retained
by the husband, would be gathered into his
estate, and the interest that was given to
the wife might come into his estate as well
under another section in another act as being
a gift made within three years of death.
Having regard to the advertising that has
been given to the generosity of the Government and the taxing authority in permitting
a gift of $10,000 once in a lifetime, I sincerely
hope that is not-to use a terrn that I used
earlier-"Indian giving", because if the
public, who may avail themselves of this,
find out, first, that the gift is not a good
gift and is going to be taxed because it is
not actually being used as a place of residence
for the husband and wife; or, secondly, if
the husband dies within three years, and they
find that the whole value under two different
sections in the Estate Tax Bill is going to
come into the estate of the husband, I am

sure there will be not only weeping and
wailing, but vocal protest that will reach
many high places.
Hon. Mr. Thorvaldson: I think probably
one more thing might be said about this
section. In my own experience in western
Canada, including the city of Winnipeg, nowadays when a young married couple, or indeed
a middle-aged couple for that matter, buy
a house, in nine out of ten cases invariably
the title is placed in their names as joint
tenants, not as tenants in common.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Thorvaldson: Time goes on, and
after perhaps five or ten years, or longer,
one spouse dies, and the income tax authorities have no end of trouble in trying to
determine whether the wife had a true
ownership interest in that house or whether
it ought to be deemed that the husband
exclusively was the owner of the whole
property. Those cases exist in large numbers
and they will become multiplied as time
goes on. Perhaps this legislation is partially
intended to overcome that recurring problem of income tax administration.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: I do not think so, and
that is the reason I pose this question,
because if a husband acquired a property
ten or twelve years ago and it is placed in
the joint names of the husband and wife,
I would assume certainly that time works in
favour of the 50 per cent interest in the
property held to be the property of the wife
when the husband dies, as and when the
provisions of the present Estate Tax Bill
come into force. But there is an opportunity
under this bill, if it is properly framed, for
the husband to make a gift of the balance
of the homestead property so that his wife
may end up with 100 per cent of the property, if we are sure that the conditions are
properly devised in this bill.
Motion agreed to and bill read second
time.

Hon. W. M. Aselline: Honourable senators,
before the business of the day is proceeded
with I wish to announce-what, perhaps, all
honourable senators know-that the Honourable the Speaker of this chamber has been
appointed by the Prime Minister to represent
Canada at the Canada Day ceremonies at the
World's Fair, Brussels, Belgium, on Monday,
August 25. For that reason he will not be
present today, nor possibly next week.
It is a great honour for this chamber that
our Speaker has been selected for this
important assignment, and I am sure he
will carry out his duties with distinction
and to the full satisfaction of all Canadians.

The Senate resumed from yesterday the
adjourned debate on the motion of Hon. Mr.
Aseltine for the second reading of Bill C-43,
to amend the Financial Administration Act.
Hon. W. M. Aselline: Honourable senators,
yesterday I moved the adjournment of the
debate on this bill for the purpose of looking
into certain matters which had been raised
by the honourable senator from Ottawa West
(Hon. Mr. Connolly) and I would like at
this time to give a-not exactly, perhaps,
my own-learned opinion on the point which
was raised at that time.
Section 20 of the British North America
Act provides that there shall be a session of
the Parliament of Canada once at least in
every year, so that twelve months shall not
intervene between the last sitting of Parliament in one session and the first sitting in
the next session. Each Parliament consists
of one or more terms or periods known as
sessions. The first of these begins on the day
on which the new Parliament is directed by
royal proclamation to meet and continues
until Parliament is prorogued by the Queen.
The Deputy Governor, in pronouncing prorogation on behalf of the Queen, names
the day on which Parliament is to reassemble,
when the new session begins. The length
of each session is therefore determined by
royal proclamation. In Canada a session
usually lasts for several months, but it may
last for a year or longer. It may also be
shorter. When Parliament is adjourned,
either sine die or to a definite day, it is still
in session.
In the present bill Governor General's
warrants are authorized where a payment
is urgently required for the public good
when Parliament is not in session. When
Parliament is adjourned it is in session and
therefore if Governor General's warrants
are to be issued during a long adjournment

CUSTOMS TARIFF BILL
SECOND

READING

Hon. Lionel Choquette moved the second
reading of Bill C-50, to amend the Customs
Tariff.
He said: Honourable senators, this bill is
neither lengthy nor complicated. It contains
only four sections. The explanatory notes,
which also are short and simple, state that
the purpose of the bill is to implement the
budget resolutions on the Customs Tariff.
Section 1 of the bill gives definitions of
terms used throughout the legislation.
Section 2 provides for the amendment of
schedule A of the act by striking out the
tariff items listed in the section.
Section 3 provides for the amendment of
schedule B, which is the second and only
other schedule mentioned in the bill, by
striking out the items therein enumerated.
Section 4 reads:

generally. Honourable senators may have
noticed that, instead of dealing in one resolution with all the amendments to schedule A,
and in another with all the amendments to
schedule B, as has been the practice, this year
there are several resolutions dealing with
each schedule. The reason, I suppose, is
quite apparent: it is that separate resolutions
have been introduced to deal with the
subject-matter of each of the four reports of
the Tariff Board, and there are two resolutions which deal with miscellaneous tariff
items in these respective schedules that are
to be amended.
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): The
honourable gentleman is referring to "resolutions". There is not any resolution before us,
but a bill which contains schedules A and B,
and I cannot follow what the honourable
senator means when he talks about four
different resolutions.
Hon. Mr. Choquette: What I intended to do
was to explain how these tariff rates have
been arrived at. I was referring to resolutions brought in in the other place, based
on certain representations made by manufacturers. Notwithstanding those representations and resolutions, some changes have
been made in the tariffs which are before
this chamber today.
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Otiawa West): I can
understand that resolutions contained in reports of the Tariff Board may have been
changed by the Government when it proposed its legislative program in respect of
tariffs, but I wonder whether the honourable
member is speaking about the procedure in
another place, where they may very well, and
in fact do, introduce resolutions arising out
of the budget speech and upon which the
legislation now before us is based. These
resolutions, however, are not before us, so
the reference is confusing.
Hon. Mr. Choquette: The honourable senator is quite right. I merely wanted to
present some explanation as to how these
tariffs have been arrived at. I will make no
further allusion to resolutions at this time.
As honourable senators know, the Tariff
Board is composed of experts. They hear
representations of Canadian manufacturers,
examine closely the conditions respecting
goods manufactured in Canada and goods to
be exported to other countries, and materials
to be imported here for use in the manufacture
of goods to be used and sold in this country
and exported to other countries.
It would be easy, honourable senators, if
we could say: "After serious consideration
by the Tariff Board of all these questions,
after receiving representations from our
manufacturers, the Board in its wisdom has

decided to place the following tariff on exports and imports." Very few members of
this chamber or of the other place would
wish to question the wisdom of the Tariff
Board in its recommendations.
However, for the purpose of this bill it has
been necessary, when considering certain
goods to be imported and exported by this
country, to make certain departures from the
recommendations of the Board, without in any
way casting reflections upon the ability and
competency of its members, who are, without
doubt, experts in their field.
Three factors must be considered by the
Department of Finance before rates of duty
are fixed on goods to be imported and exported which depart from the rates recommended by the Tariff Board. The first of
such factors is the result of GATT or the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, and
negotiations in relation thereto. It is seldom
or never possible to obtain consent to all
the rates recommended by any one party;
there must be some give and take. This
results in adjustments downward on rates
recommended by the Tariff Board, and as
well on rates offered as a compensating adjustment. In tariff negotiations, as in all
others, there must be some quid pro quo.
The second factor is the result of representations received from the Tariff Board in reports which are made public. Not infrequently
some facts are brought to light to which the
attention of the board was not directed, or
which were inadequately presented to it.
The third consideration effecting changes
may result from additional consideration
by the Department of Finance. During the
course of GATT negotiations or of receiving
representations the highly-skilled, diligent and
competent officers of the department may
reach conclusions which differ somewhat from
those of the Tariff Board. When they convince the Minister of Finance that their views
are right he takes the responsibility of making recommendations to Parliament, exactly
as his predecessors did.
What are the facts today? The tariff proposals of the budget are: (1) neither high
tariff nor low tariff, (2) neither protectionist
nor free trade. Our approach, honourable
senators, must be a pragmatic one: What,
in the exercise of reasonable judgment of a
given situation, is likely to produce the most
effective result? In some cases that involves
tariff increases, and so a higher tariff, but
in more instances it involves reduction. On
balance, there are more reductions than increases.
It is my firm belief, honourable senators,
that these resolutions are based upon solid
economic facts, upon a wholesome, realistic
and pragmatic approach.

SENATE
I have already explained that there is a
British Preferential Tariff, a Most-FavouredNation Tariff, and a General Tariff.
Most recommendations of the Tariff Board
have been followed. However, these recommendations were made by the board about
a year ago. Since then further recommendations presented to the minister by industry
and manufacturers have caused the department or the minister to make certain changes
in the tariffs recommended by the board. Consequently the tariff is increased in certain
cases and decreased in others.
I should like to read to the house a very
timely editorial which was published in the
Ottawa Journal last evening. The article,
entitled "United States Trade Policy: The
Larger Truth", reads:

Hon. Mr. Choquette: Honourable senators,
I am not going into the details of all the
articles and goods mentioned in Schedules
A and B of the bill. It is my intention to
move that the bill be referred to the Banking
and Commerce Committee, where honourable senators, no matter whether they are
members of the committee or not, can ask
questions on any item that interests them.
The departmental experts are in a better
position than I am to explain why there has
been a decrease or an increase in duties.
The general principle behind the legislation is that where goods are manufactured
in this country it is in the interests of the
Government to see that our market is not
flooded with that type of goods. After negotiations with GATT on a policy of give and
take, certain discussions took place and some
tariffs were increased and others decreased.
I can report that so far the manufacturers
of the various goods referred to in Schedules
A and B have been quite satisfied with the
tariffs proposed in this bill.
Hon. Norman P. Lamberi: May I ask my
honourable friend if he has information con-

especially woollen textiles.
On page 8 of the bill, under Part IV, of

I have nothing more to say on this bill
except that I am glad it does not show any
more drastic change in the schedules than is
indicated here, the exact nature of which I
hope we can have revealed more clearly in
committee.
Hon. John J. Connolly (Ottawa West): Honourable senators, I would first of all like to
compliment my honourable friend from Ottawa
East (Hon. Mr. Choquette) on the presentation which he has made of this measure and
to say again that I am pleased indeed to sec
him taking such an active part in the deliberations of this chamber. I know that he can
make, and will make, a very substantial contribution to its work as time goes on.
I must say that I rather enjoyed the concluding part of his address, particularly as I
think I can detect a bit of inconsistency in it
and it is not beyond me to point this out. I
was very pleased to hear him read with approval an editorial from that great local organ
the Ottawa Journal in which the American
Government was commended for the liberal
trade policies it has been applying in recent
years and to which it has very recently rededicated itself in the passage of the new
Reciprocal Trade Act which, as the senior
senator from Ottawa (Hon. Mr. Lambert) lias
said, gives powers to the President for a
further period of five years to liberalize the
trade and tariff measures of the United States.
But my friend having donc this, which warmed
my heart so much-I must say that I was
warmed also by the work of the editorial
writer in the Journalof last night-I am afraid
I was not surprised, though I felt a little
tinge of regret, when my friend went on to
say that despite the liberal policies which the
American Government has been adopting and
apparently will continue to adopt, we in
Canada however must establish a policy of
protection.
Well, I think that is going on. My friend's
party, which is in power now, is traditionally
a party which believes in the principle of
protection, and I honour it for standing fast
on that platform. Certainly in the measure
we have before us there is evidence that that
policy is still a policy of his party. I find in
spite of the recommendations or reports that
have been made by the Tariff Board from
time to time, the Government has taken its
responsibility and has increased the tariff on
certain items. Take, for example, steel billets,
item 378 in the schedule.
Before I go into that I might say it bas
been extremely difficult to compare the situation under the old items with that under the
new items. I would hope that on another

occasion these schedules could be so drawn
that the old position and the new position
would both appear side by side. It would
be a convenience to everybody.
I come to item 378. In the three columns,
British Preferential Tariff, Most-FavouredNation Tariff and General Tariff, under the
present tariff the rates are respectively free,
free and 5 per cent. The Tariff Board recommended that the rates be free, $3.50 a ton and
$5.00 a ton, and the Government proposal is
free, 5 per cent and 10 per cent. What the
relation is between 5 per cent and $3.50 a
ton I am not prepared at the moment to say,
but I am informed that it does represent an
increase in the tariff heretofore imposed on
these steel billets, and an increase over and
above the Tariff Board's recommendation.
Another item I might mention in this sarne
connection is 382(5), coated sheets. The
present rates are 5 per cent, l2½ per cent and
15 per cent, respectively, in the three columns.
The Tariff Board's recommendation was: free,
10 per cent and 20 per cent. This Government measure provides rates of 7' per cent,
15 per cent and 20 per cent.
I have picked only two items out of some
117 items which have been changed. I do
not say that they are all revised upward;
a good many are revised downward. I do
not say either that this measure is a serious
tariff increase measure.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: Was the honourable
senator referring to item 385?
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): I was
referring to item 382, subsection 5, on page
5 of the bill. I would be less than fair if I
said that this bill was a serious measure to
increase the tariff across the board. That is
not the case. But I do say that there is an
increased tariff on many items. Moreover, the
Government bas indicated it proposes to renegotiate certain items under the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade with reference to certain items, including woollens from
Italy and fruits and vegetables from the
United States.
Our trade with Italy bas been a flourishing
trade from our point of view ever since the
last war. We sell about twice as much there
as we buy, and the Italian authorities have
said that if we increase our tariff on Italian
products, particularly the woollens which
come from that country, it is going to be
increasingly difficult for Italians to buy the
fish and other products that they get from
this country.
Hon. Mr. Lamberi: The same with Japan.
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Oitawa West): The
main reason, of course, is the shortage of
dollars in Italy. We can supply them with

AUGUST 22, 1958
more dollars to buy our products by buying
more products from them. I think it would
be well to reconsider the suggestion that
GATT be revised so that Italian woollens
would be subjected to heavier tariff on
entering Canada.
The honourable senior senator from Ottawa
(Hon. Mr. Lambert) has mentioned wool
cloth. Let me say at once that I recognize
that this industry presents a serious and
continuing problem that has challenged the
Governments of this country ever since the
late war. The Tariff Board has held many
lengthy hearings to consider the position of
the Canadian textile industry generally.
I have some figures which indicate what
has happened to the woollen industry since
1946. From them it will be apparent that not
only has the number of mills declined, but
the employment has also dropped. In 1946
there were 100 mills, employing 9,900 people;
in 1950 there were 85 mills, employing 9,200;
in 1955 there were 76 mills, employing a
little over 6,600; and by 1957 there were only
54 mills, employing approximately 5,700
persons.
The Tariff Board, in its report on the wool
cloth industry and textiles generally, said
that the problem was more than fiscal, it was
social. In the days when the industry was
established in this country, mills were frequently set up in small towns, whose economy
revolved around the existence of the mills
and the employment they gave to the area.
The board gave consideration also to the
importance of this industry in the event of
an emergency, such as a war, and was loud
in its praise of the contribution which the
industry had made to the production required
during the late war for the use of the armed
services. The industry met the demand handsomely, at a time when the need was vital.
Had we been dependent on British manufacturers for the production of textiles needed
by our servicemen, these goods would have
had to be convoyed across the Atlantic and
would have greatly increased the demands
on our convoy facilities.
The Tariff Board recommended a most
modest increase in the tariff for the textile
industry, and was very careful to say that
the proposed increase was not intended to
make that industry prosperous but was
barely sufficient to enable it to survive.
So I say, honourable senators, the decision
as to what is to be done in connection with
the textile industry in this country has not
been taken yet. It bas been postponed, and
will be a matter for serious consideration for
future Government policy. If action is to be
taken it will probably come before us by
way of a bill of this kind, when the policy
has been decided.

Hon. Mr. Lamberi: May I interrupt my
honourable friend for a moment? Am I right
in my recollection that the Tariff Board's
report made some reference to the necessity
for scientific improvements in Canadian processing and manufacturing, in order to meet
competition from other countries?
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): That
is true.
Honourable senators will of course appreciate that the problem confronting this industry is not only the competition from
imported British woollens. A considerable
problem arises by reason of the lighter type
of yard goods produced abroad and finding
favour in this country. The trend in Canada
is toward lighter clothing, principally because
of the fact that we are more and more
living in overheated houses, riding in overheated cars, and perhaps as often as possible
getting away from cold climate. Another
aspect of the case is the variety of imported
synthetie materials which are becoming more
and more competitive with woollen cloth.
So the technical and scientific advances made
in other countries are making it increasingly
difficult for the Canadian industry to survive,
particularly when the wage rates in our mills
are in keeping with those prevailing in other
Canadian industries.
This is a problem which no Government
would like to find on its doorstep. It is a
most difficult one. If we in the Senate do no
more than expose some of the skeletal
features of the problem, we shall at least
arouse some public interest in a matter which
deeply concerns a great many Canadians,
particularly in the eastern part of the country.
Honourable senators, I did not intend to
speak at this length, but I did wish to make
a few remarks on the bill. I again commend
my honourable friend from Ottawa East (Hon.
Mr. Choquette) for his presentation of the
bill.
Hon. Gunnar S. Thorvaldson: Honourable
senators, I had not intended to speak in the
debate on this bill, but one feature of the
discussion prompts me to say a few words.
It is the very conciliatory attitude that I
find on the other side of the house to suggested increases in the customs tariff on
certain items.
There used to be a time when the major
political parties became almost hysterical
when any changes in the Canadian tariff
were involved. I regard it as one of the
signs that we in this country are growing
up politically, that in recent federal elections we have not had the shadow boxing
concerning tariff matters that we experienced
from time to time in former days. I recall
as a youth that the early elections in western

SENATE

Canada-say from 1911 on, in times when
we were not engaged in a war-were fought
nearly exclusively over tariff questions. For
myself, I was never able to see any great
difference between the effective tariff policies
of the two main parties when they were in
power. There was often a considerable difference between their views as expressed
while in opposition and their actual policies
when in office. All one has to do is to
examine the record, and one will find that
the tariff levels in this country have been
pretty much the same, whichever party was
in office, from the 1880's until the present
time. It is often said that Canadian tariffs
were considerably increased during the 1930's,
but an examination of the average Canadian
customs tariff over the years will show that
the increases over the whole field during
those years were comparatively insignificant.
I think therefore it is a sign of real progress
that nowadays the political parties of this
country have something more worth while to
talk about than whether the customs tariff
is protectionist or not protectionist, whether
it is high or low; for, I repeat, as I read the
tariff history of this country, most of our
people, as well as the political parties themselves, have had much the same views in this
regard.
Also I feel it to be a very salutary fact
that Canada has a Tariff Board in which
Canadians generally seem to have a great
deal of confidence. I have observed throughout the years that almost everybody is willing to take a realistic attitude in judging
the evidence presented to the board and its
conclusions.
I am from western Canada. At one time
it was freely stated that the West and the
Maritimes were advocates of free trade. It
is true that some years ago there was considerable demand in both regions for lower
tariffs, becau'se it was believed that the central
provinces were benefiting unduly from Canadian tariffs at the expense of the West and
other parts of the country.
Hon. Mr. Isnor: Hear, hear. Quite true.
Hon. Mr. Thorvaldson: There may have
been some truth in that, during those earlier
years. It was true that we in the West
had to sell our wheat on an export basis,
and consequently in a world market, whereas
we had to buy manufactured products in a
protected market. The Maritimes were very
much in the same position. But in this
respect times have changed, and one indication of the change is, I think, the fact that,
at any rate in western Canada, one can peruse
our newspapers for months without finding
an editorial on the subject of Canada's
customs tariff policies.

One of the main reasons for this change
in attitude of western Canadians is that we
have obtained from governments other and
compensating advantages which have gone a
long way to reconcile us to the degree of
protection which the central provinces are
said to enjoy. At the same time it should
be remembered that the West is becoming
industrialized. There was a time when that
part of our country depended almost wholly
on the export of wheat, grain, flour and
other agricultural products. But if one looks
at the current statistics as regards the industrialization of western Canada, particularly Manitoba and British Columbia, and
more recently Alberta, it will be evident
that the proceeds from industrial activity
are enormous, rivalling if not exceeding the
income we derive from the soil.
I was rather interested in the Ottawa
Journal's editorial with regard to United
States trade policies. A few moments ago
I remarked that if one examined the average
Canadian tariff yearly from the eighteeneighties until now it would be found that
the differentials throughout the years are
quite small. Investigation will also disclose
that throughout the years, when the American
tariff was high, so also was the Canadian
tariff, no matter whether Liberals or Conservatives were in power; and that when
the United States tariff was low, so also
was the Canadian tariff. I submit that the
facts are incontrovertible in that regard. In
1920-21 the Fordney-McCumber tariff was
instituted in the United States, and we here
had to follow the upward process despite
the fact that the Liberal party was then in

States duties rose enormously, because of
the Smoot-Hawley tariff, Canadian tariffs
followed in the same direction. So, although
I do not say that Canadian tariff policy has
been made in Washington, its essential features have been dictated by Washington.
Hon. Mr. Isnor: May I ask whether it is
not the fact that negotiations were started
by the Liberal party when in power with
a view to the lowering of United States
tariffs?
Hon. Mr. Thorvaldson: That is so. I believe
the tariff history of this country shows that
all parties have sought, from time to time,
to secure a lowering of American tariff rates.
I am sure it is the desire of every Canadian
that the policy of our neighbours in respect
of their tariff policies should be more and
more liberalized, and by none is such a trend
more heartily approved than by myself.
As regards the Journal editorial, I would
like to say that the use of averages in respect
of customs duties often gives a distorted

AUGUST 22, 1958
However, I do not want to be critical of
United States tariff policy, because in any
event we should be thankful for the fact that
in the last few years it has not changed to
our disadvantage. I think it may be accepted
that President Eisenhower has indeed adopted
toward Canada a policy which has been just
as generous as he could possibly make it

land survey, yet from these briefs your committee has found that new problems have
actually been brought to their attention and
it felt that it could not give any considered
opinion until a great deal more study has
been given to that particular problem.
Your committee feels that it should concentrate on one phase of land use, such as
soil survey, best agricultural practice, water
conservation or water drainage and best use
of our forests and their products, until it has
exhausted that particular phase from one end
of the dominion to the other. Only in this
way can it bring in a clear and comprehensive report. For that reason, a large
part of this report which is now submitted to
you is concerned with suggestions for a
continuing committee and future study and
work.
Hon. Austin C. Taylor (Westmorland): Honourable senators, it was not my original
intention to speak at any length at all, nor
do I intend to speak at length now. I
merely intend to make a few remarks in
connection with the work of the committee.
Our Vice-Chairman, the honourable senator
from Montarville (Hon. Mr. Bois), called me
at noon today to say that at one o'clock he
was entering hospital for quite a serious
operation, and he asked me to present some
of his views on this subject to the Senate.
I am obliged, therefore, to try to incorporate
my own thinking with that of the honourable
senator, and if my remarks seem to be a bit
disjointed I trust you will bear with me in
that respect.
First of all, I should like to express my
appreciation to the former Chairman of the
committee, the honourable senator from Gulf
(Hon. Mr. Power), who organized the committee in the first instance. By reason of
his organizing ability and his willingness to
take advice from the members of the committee who had had a good deal of experience
in agricultural and conservation work, a good
start was made. I wish at this time to
compliment him on the fine review of the
committee's work be gave in this chamber
on June 12 last.
I do wish to pay a tribute to the present
Chairman, the honourable senator form Lumsden (Hon. Mr. Pearson), who has taken a
great interest in the work of the committee,
and bas in my opinion, shown the ability
to carry out his duties successfully. One of
the reasons for his excellent work in the
committee is that be is a farmer and well
informed on this matter of land use. He is
aware of some of the special problems in
that part of Canada from which be comes.
It may probably be the view of some bonourable senators that too much time and
effort have been devoted to the field of

agriculture. I wish to remind them that the
terms of reference are as follows:
That a Special Committee of the Senate be
appointed to consider and report on land use in
Canada and what should be done to ensure that
our land resources are most effectively utilized for
the benefit of the Canadian economy and the
Canadian people and, in particular, to increase
both agricultural production and the incomes of
those engaged in it.

To me, the last part of the terms of reference, namely, the production aspect, is not
quite so important, because at the present
time there are large surpluses of certain
agricultural products in Canada, but I believe the time is fast approaching when these
will gradually disappear, and that unless
something is done for the improvement of
agriculture in its various aspects we may
in the not too far distant future find ourselves short of these products.
I wish to emphasize that part of the terms
of reference which deals with the incomes
of those engaged in agricultural production.
When this committee was first set up, one of
the first things the steering committee considered was the making of a complete study
upon which certain basic recommendations
could be presented, not only with respect
to the present but as projected into the future. It was felt that we should know something of what has been done by the federal
Government, and provincial and municipal
Governments, farm organizations, and other
bodies throughout Canada which have taken
an interest in the improvement and development of agriculture and the betterment of
land use in Canada. For that reason it was
necessary for us to accumulate, through
witnesses, all the information possible on the
subject. As a result, some thirty to fifty
witnesses were heard, and some 350 pages
of evidence have been published.
The fact remains that most of our consideration has been given to agriculture and I think
I have explained one of the reasons why, but
I would like to say also that the committee
is not thinking of putting aside the question
of land use in other fields of activity-for instance, in forestry-in relation to the national
development. We did feel, however, that
agriculture is the most important point and
that is the reason we have been giving so
much attention to it.
The study by the committee has shown,
as the honourable chairman has just said, that
certain facts have appeared to us as being
important. One of these is that we have in
Canada a lot of soil that is unproductive,
probably because of soil and farming practices which are not of the best. There is
the fact, too, that we lack adequate markets

SENATE
for the products we export. We also have
to consider related subjects, such as inefficient
farm operations.
In looking over the Dominion Bureau of
Statistics figures it will be noted that in the
15 years from 1941 to 1956 there was a reduction in the number of farms in Canada from
732,832 to 575,015. At the same time there
was a very slight reduction in the number
of acres under cultivation, which indicates
that farmers are acquiring larger units. By
reason of new techniques and mechanization,
we have been able to increase production from
those same acres in the same 15 years to the
extent of about 31 per cent. And it is well
worth noting that the number of people living
on farms today is about 16 or 17 per cent
less than in 1941.
In a study of this great problem there are
many factors which have to be considered,
among which are water resources development, depletion of soil fertility, soil erosion,
dyking of marshlands in Eastern Canada to
keep out salt water, and draining of land in
other parts of Canada, which is necessary,
I understand, in some sections of every
province.
One of the recommendations made to the
committee was that a centralized agency
be established to give direction to research
in respect to land and water use problems.
We recognize the need for that, but we are
aware that there are many other important
problems. We feel at the moment that the
committee's job is to tackle studies of land
and water use, to study the problems of
marketing, production and processing. I could
give some examples of what has been done
in dealing with this processing problem.
There are in Nova Scotia, and I believe also
in Quebec, processing plants that in most
cases have been established by the producers
themselves. For instance, in the apple growing industry windfalls are now being used
for the production of apple juice. In the
province of Manitoba, if I recall correctly
from my visit there of some 10 years ago, the
farmers have organized the production of
sunflower seeds and have machinery and
plants to process that seed into oil and other
products.
I think the committee should study also
and determine if possible what organization
should be established to give leadership to
the national program. Industrial uses of
agricultural products are another subject that
should be given consideration. And in my
opinion we should study existing programs
for better land use. I would like to give
some examples of what I have in mind. In
western Canada the provisions of the Prairie
Farm Rehabilitation Act are made use of and
a number of projects have been started under

that legislation. Volunteer organizations of
farmers themselves have started programs of
conservation and other projects. We have in
operation in the Maritimes what are known
as Maritime Marshland Reclamation projects,
which are altogether different from projects
in western Canada. The program down east
is to prevent salt water from overfiowing
our farm land.
Those are projects that I think the committee as a whole should understand completely. One of the points that the honourable
senator from Montarville (Hon. Mr. Bois)
wished me to bring to the attention of the
Senate is this. We feel that if we are to do
the job which honourable senators expect
us to do, and the job that the farm people
of Canada expect us to do, we must not just
sit down here in Ottawa and look over some
of the programs that have been carried
on throughout the country, some of which
might be regarded favourably and others unfavourably. We feel that subcommittees
should be set up so that they could study
projects in various provinces. Some of the
projects studied by the subcommittees might
prove to be failures and some might be successes, but we should know at first hand the
degree of success or the degree of failure of
these projects throughout Canada. Furthermore, I submit that such subcommittees
should have the opportunity to view at firsthand land use projects in the United States
and probably in some other countries.
Now under the rules of the Senate this
committee ceases to function when prorogation takes place. Ordinarily, when Parliament
is in session the committee might be able to
visit various projects, but I doubt it very
much. Certainly if a session started in January, the weather would make it impossible
for some months to view projects on farms
or in farming communities throughout Canada. The necessary authority should be given
to some body, whether it be a commission
set up as a subcommittee of this Land Use
Committee or not, so that some effort at
least might be made to develop a program
for conducting a complete study, in order
that when recommendations are made by this
committee they will be based not on hearsay
or on evidence that we have heard but on
actual sightseeing of what is taking place in
Canada. In that way we could be sure that
our recommendations were sound.
I do not know whether all senators recognize the magnitude of this undertaking as
I do. Because I have farmed and lived on
a farm all my life, I know some of the
problems connected with farming. I have
visited every province except Newfoundland,
and I have studied farm problems in those

AUGUST 22, 1958
provinces, and I know that they differ between province and province-that they even
differ between one part of a province and
another part of the same province, and
that even between individual farms problems
will differ.
This is truly a tremendous undertaking,
the magnitude of which one can hardly
visualize. I think it is highly important,
dealing as we are with the lives and livelihood of some 700,000 or 800,000 people, that
we should give some serious thought to
project into the future a plan or a program
by which we can better the conditions of
our farm people in Canada. That to me is
one of the tremendous tasks I see before
this committee.
Certain suggestions have been made in
relation to legislation. As a matter of fact
one organization presented a plan, or rather
made a suggestion.
Personally I do not
think that we are in a position at the moment
to recommend what that legislation might
be. I think very extensive study might be
given to it. But the suggestion bas been
made-I have made it myself on various
occasions-that if we had a national act of
general application to land use in Canada,
with sufficient flexibility to cover various
existing projects, such as the Prairie Farm
Rehabilitation Act and the Maritime Marshland Rehabilitation Act and other local
projects, it could well serve as a basis for
future recommendations on land use in this
country.
Honourable senators, I realize that vast
areas of our agricultural land are today
being utilized for commercial buildings,
industrial sites and new residences. It hurts
me more than I can say to see good land
used for other than agricultural purposes,
but there is not much one can do about it.
Communities have been established, the
population is increasing, and room must be
made for programs of expansion. However,
I feel strongly that in our future planning
great care should be exercised-and I hope
this will be one of the recommendations put
forward by the committee-to the end that
only land not suitable for agriculture will
be used for industrial and business purposes.
Some years ago an area of about 23 acres
at the north end of Toronto, which had been
used during the war by the Department of
National Defence, was turned over to the
War Assets Corporation for disposal after the
war.
The land was purchased by two
individuals, who were thought at the time
to be very unwise, because it was rough and
had a deep ravine running through it. But
those two men got their heads together,
hired heavy bulldozers and other equipment, and levelled the land. Today that is

a valuable commercial site in the northern
part of Toronto.
That I regard as an
example of what can be done by exercising
care in the choice of land to be used for
other than agricultural purposes.
Honourable senators, may I say a few
words in relation to farm people themselves?
Being a farmer, I am probably as close to
their problems as any one here, and I know
something of the difficulties they have faced
over the years. I know that farmers have
become individualistic in their outlook
because their particular problems are different from those of other people. We owe
them a debt of gratitude and we must do
what we can to improve their lot.
If I may be pardoned for doing so, I
should like to mention a personal experience to illustrate what I think is a typical
case of loyalty and sacrifice on the part of
farm people. At the beginning of the last
war, 1939 or early in 1940, when the first
Victory loan campaign was on, I was asked
by the authorities to address a meeting ip a
At first I
rural area of our province.
refused, because I knew that over the years,
from 1929 up to 1939, by reason of economic
conditions farmers were unable to create any
capital. Indeed, they had been living off
their capital. By that I mean they had
allowed the fertility of their soil to go down
because they could not afford to buy fertilizer; their buildings had gone into disrepair
because they could not afford to keep them
in repair and to buy the paint to keep them
painted.
However, upon being pressed, I said, "If
there is one man in that community who may
have a little money to buy Victory Bonds,
I will go." I went to the meeting, and I did
my best to interpret to those people conditions
in Europe and Great Britain. Incidentally,
only a few days earlier the York-Sunbury
regiment had left the shores of Canada to go
overseas. I told my audience it was their
duty to help out their country in time of
need. I shall never forget an old gentleman
who came to me afterwards. He had lost two
sons in the First World War, and because of
circumstances beyond his control he was then
almost penniless. His barn had burned down
twice, once by lightning, and his wife had
been dead for about two years. He came to
me and, calling me by my first name, said,
"I will raise $100 if I have to sell some of the
things out of my home." As he said it, tears
were streaming down his face. That was the
type of loyalty to be found throughout the
rural areas during those war years when
only the older men and women were left to
run the farms.
I recall another occasion on which I was
to address a farm group. I arrived about an

SENATE

hour before the meeting and went to the
farm of a chap I knew to pay him a visit.
There was no one in the house, so I went to
the barn, where I found the farmer and his
wife-people then of about 65 or 70 years of
age-milking a fine herd of Jersey cows, 28
of them, and doing it all alone. Their two
sons had enlisted in the war. I said to the
mother, who was a frail little thing, "Isn't
this work too much for you?" She looked up
at me with a smile and said, "This is one job
I can do, and I am happy to do it."
That is typical of the spirit of sacrifice and
devotion among farm people all across this
country. Therefore, I say we as a body should
do all we can to help farm people. They are

the great stabilizing influence of our nation.
One never hears about strikes or other labour
troubles among farmers. I repeat that we
owe the farmers a debt of gratitude for what
they have done for the country over the years.
I hope the Land Use Committee, when it
presents its final report, will be able to offer
to them a plan which will improve their
position economically, and that they will be
a happier people because of it.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa

DOCUMENT TABLED
Hon. W. M. Aseltine: Honourable senators,
I lay on the Table the following report:
Report of the Defence Production Department for
the year ended December 31, 1957. (French text).

STANDING COMMITTEES
NOTICE OF MOTION FOR AMENDMENT
OF RULES

Hon. W. M. Aseltine: Honourable senators,
I give notice of motion to amend Senate
Rules 78 and 79.
[Later:]
Hon. David A. Croll: As we have some
time on our hands, would the honourable
Leader of the Government (Hon. Mr. Aseltine) care to state the contents of the proposed amendment to Rules 78 and 79?
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: If it is the wish of the
Senate, I have no objection.
Hon. Senators: Agreed.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: As honourable senators
know, on the opening day of each session a
committee is set up for the purpose of
selecting members to serve on the various
standing committees. Usually the report of
the Selection Committee is adopted, and then
a meeting of all the standing committees is
held for the purpose of choosing their respective chairmen. Rule 78 lists the various
standing committees and the number of senators composing each of them, and Rule 79
states that the majority of the members of
any committee constitutes a quorum. About
all that these committees do at their first
meeting is to decide to bring in a report to
the Senate recommending that their quorums
be reduced to a certain number of members.
The rule of the House of Commons which is
similar to our Rule 78 is Standing Order 65,
which provides for the setting up of their
standing committees and the fixing of their
quorums. For example, the standing order
provides that the Banking and Commerce
Committee of the House of Commons shall
consist of 50 members and that 15 members
shall constitute a quorum.
The idea behind the proposed amendment,
which I have discussed with the honourable

Leader of the Opposition (Hon. Mr. Macdonald), is to delete both Rules 78 and 79 and
substitute therefor new Rules 78 and 79. The
new Rule 78 would read as follows:
78. The standing committees shall be as follows:

Then it goes on to state the number of
members of each committee and the number
which would constitute a quorum. For example:
The Committee on Banking and Commerce, composed of 50 senators, 9 of whom shall constitute
a quorum.

If Rule 78 is amended as proposed in this
notice of motion, it will no longer be necessary for each of the standing committees to
make their first report at the beginning of
the session recommending a reduction in their
quorum.
The new Rule 79 would simply read as
follows:
79. Every standing or special committee meets,
if practical, on the next sitting day after appointment and chooses a chairman.

EXCISE TAX BILL
COMMITTEE AMENDMENT CONCURRED IN

The Senate proceeded to consideration of
the amendment made by the Standing Committee on Banking and Commerce to Bill
C-44, to amend the Excise Tax Act.
Hon. W. M. Aseltine: Honourable senators,
perhaps I should make an explanation of the
reason why I asked on two previous occasions that this report stand. The reason was
that there seemed to be some differences of
opinion among the members of the committee
as to whether "prima facie evidence" or
"prima facie proof" was the proper expression to use under the circumstances. Another
reason was that no officers of the Department
of Justice were present at the meeting of the
committee to express their views. However,
in my opinion the proper way to settle this
question is to amend the Canada Evidence Act,
and I am therefore not continuing my objection to the amendment at the present time.
Hon. John J. Connolly (Ottawa West):
Honourable senators, on behalf of the honourable senator from Toronto (Hon. Mr.
Hayden), Chairman of the committee, I
move concurrence in the amendment.
I would like to say a word about this
matter. I know the honourable senator from
Toronto felt that the wording in the bill
should be "prima facie evidence" rather than
"prima facie proof".
We have debated this question previously.
It is not very important in some respects. It
is a technical matter, a matter of detail, of
interest to lawyers perhaps more than to
anyone else. There have been times within

SENATE

the last four or five years when we have
used one expression in certain legislation and
the other expression in other legislation.
About a year ago the point arose on a measure
I was interested in or was explaining, and
we spent some considerable time in discussing
which was the proper phrase. At that time,
officials of the Department of Justice took
a strong stand that the wording should be as it
now appears in the bill. In any event, they said
that through usage the two expressions had
perhaps come to mean the same thing. There
is authority in the Canadian Encyclopaedic
Digest for the proposition that they do in
practice have the same meaning. The senator
from Toronto does not hold that view. He
thinks the words mean what they say, and
that "prima facie evidence" is the appropriate
expression in this instance.
I agree with the suggestion of the honourable leader of the Government that we should
come to grips with the question by deciding
on an amendment to the Canada Evidence
Act to clarify the point.
Hon. W. Ross Macdonald: Honourable senators, this matter was discussed fully in
committee before the change was approved.
Although all members of the committee were
not of one opinion with respect to the
advisability of the change, no one was
strongly opposed to it. If I recall correctly,
when the vote on the amendment was taken
it carried unanimously.
The honourable
Leader of the Government is no doubt correct when he states that this matter was not
at that time discussed with the officials of
the Department of Justice; but my memory
is that it was discussed on previous occasions, and the officials then agreed that the
word "evidence" should be used in place of
"proof". In any event, honourable senators,
when this amendment was discussed in committee, no one voted against it.

little difference between the two expressions that it is hardly worth any controversy.
Consequently, I am quite in agreement with
the proposed change-I take that stand now
even if I was one of those who urged the
adoption of the words as they appeared in
the bill originally-and I concur in the
amendment.
Motion agreed to.

BUSINESS OF THE SENATE
Hon. W. M. Aseiline: Honourable senators,

we are practically at the end of the proceedings for today. I am disappointed that certain
bills have not yet reached us from the House
of Commons. I fully expected that the bills
with respect to broadcasting, the amendment
to the Customs Act, the South Saskatchewan
Dam Agreement, citizenship, and other measures would have been before us now, at
least for first reading, but they have not
arrived. There remain on our Order Paper
only the answers to two inquiries, the third
reading of the National Capital Bill, and the
adjourned debate in connection with the
report of the Special Committee on Land Use
in Canada.

in having the wonderful services of the

things cannot be forgotten. I know I am
expressing the sentiment of all of us here
when I wish him full recovery and express
the hope that he will be present with us for
many, many years in this forum, where his
talents are deeply appreciated.
Hon. Jean-François Pouliot: Honourable
senators, I am very glad to second what
has just been said by the honourable senator
from Cochrane (Hon. Mr. Bradette). He has
exaggerated nothing. Senator Golding is the
salt of the earth. I have known him for
years. I knew him in the House of Commons
and I visited his constituency, and I remember with delight the fine meetings that
we had at Grand Bend, in Huron County.
There I saw what affection Senator Golding's
constituents had for him. He is a true honest
Grit of the province of Ontario. I cannot
pay him a greater compliment. He follows
in the tradition of Mowat and all the great
leaders of his party in that province. I remember how nice Senator Golding was to
me when I was in the House of Commons
arguing difficult matters and he was chairman of the Committee of the Whole. He was
fair, as was Senator Bradette, his predecessor.
I take this opportunity, honourable senators, to tell you once more that the greatest
reward we can have in politics here in
Ottawa is the making of friends, friends
who come from all over the country, who
are fine gentlemen like Bill Golding has
always been, and who have a high sense of
duty. Senator Golding has another quality
that I shall not overlook, and that is
tolerance. He is fair and tolerant and in
that connection he may be quoted as an

57075-4-43

example to all. His return to this chamber
is a pleasure to all of us. He is welcome
here. When he was not here he was missed.
His health is better now and he will continue
to be one of our most assiduous colleagues.
I wish good health to him and all members
of his family.
Hon. William H. Golding: Honourable
senators, I certainly would like to take this
opportunity to express to my two friends
who have just spoken my appreciation of
the kind words they have used in reference
to me. As they have said, we were good
friends in the House of Commons for many
years and I found their friendship was most
valuable, as did many others in the House
of Commons. I certainly have appreciated
the years I have spent in the House of
Commons and the Senate. I want particularly
to thank those who wrote to me and those
who inquired about my health, and I think
that takes in everyone here. I am deeply
grateful to honourable senators for the
lovely flowers they sent me at the hospital.
That sort of thing certainly gives a person
a lift when he is feeling a bit down. No
words of mine can ever truly express the
appreciation I feel toward the members of
this house for their kindness. A person does
not forget these things.
I may say that during all the years I
have spent in public life-some 20 years in
municipal affairs followed by 26 years in
the House of Commons and the Senate-I
have always tried in a humble way to give
my best service. After ail, I think that is
the best one can do.
Again I want to thank you all for your
kindness. I am certainly glad to be back
with you again.

ADDRESS BY DR. W. KAYE LAMB
NOTICE OF INQUIRY

Hon.

Jean-François

Pouliot:

Honourable

senators, I must take you into my confidence.
I promised the honourable Leader of the Government (Hon. Mr. Aseltine) that in order to
expedite business and not to delay prorogation
of Parliament I would ask no more questions
this session.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Pouliot: Thank you for your
applause. But, honourable senators, I have a
question for the first day of next session,
and it is as follows:
For a copy of the text of the address delivered
by Dr. W. Kaye Lamb, Dominion Archivist and
National Librarian and Vice-Chairman ex officio
of the Public Records Committee for the Destruction of Official Documents, in which he was reported
to have said at a meeting of the Canadian Historical
Society, held at Edmonton on or about June 7 ult.,
that existing biographies of Canadians could be
counted on the fingers of one hand.

PRAIRIE AGRICULTURAL PRODUCERS,
GRANTS
INQUIRY AND ANSWER

Hon. Calvert C. Pratt made the following
inquiry of the Government, pursuant to notice:
That he will request the Government, through
the Honourable the Leader of the Government in
the Senate, to place before the Senate a tabulated
statement setting forth the amount of yearly federal
payments by way of money grants, subventions and
other forms of direct assistance to grain growers
and other agricultural producers in the three Prairie
provinces and itemized by provinces during the
period from 1930 to 1958.

Hon. W. Ross Macdonald: Honourable senators, it was impossible for me to be here
last Friday afternoon when the adoption of
this report was moved by the honourable
senator from Lumsden (Hon. Mr. Pearson).
However, I have had an opportunity to read
the two excellent addresses which were made
that afternoon, one by the honourable senator from Lumsden and the other by the
honourable senator from Westmorland (Hon.
Austin C. Taylor). It was very fitting that
both should commend the honourable senator
from Gulf (Hon. Mr. Power) who was the
first chairman of the committee, which was
set up in February 1957, and under whose
direction the committee was organized and
the general method of procedure adopted.
Since the resignation of the honourable senator from Gulf as chairman the committee
has carried on under the able leadership of
the honourable senator from Lumsden.
The problem which faces the committee is
a most difficult one, particularly because, as
was pointed out the other day, land considered
unsuitable for general agricultural purposes
today may tomorrow be found suitable for
the growing of some particular product. For
instance, the county of Norfolk, Ontario, so
well represented here by the Honourable Senator William H. Taylor, contains a considerable area of light, sandy soil which for many
years produced only jackpine and other scrub
growth. The land was long thought to be
useless for cultivation. But today vast acreages of what was formerly considered substandard soil are now producing valuable
crops of tobacco, with the result that a large
portion of southwestern Ontario, including
parts of the counties of Oxford, Elgin and
Norfolk, have been transformed into a very
prosperous area. I cite that as one instance
where soil that was considered useless for
cultivation was eventually used to produce
a valuable crop for the benefit of the whole
country.

Hon. Mr. Lamberi: May I ask the honourable senator if the federal authority had

with it at all.
LAND USE

AUGUST 26, 1958
which today is considered non-productive
may tomorrow be found productive for a
special purpose. This has taken place in the
parts of Ontario I mentioned. If the development is due to efforts of the province of
Ontario, the county of Norfolk and other
counties, I am glad to give them the credit
which is theirs. The fact is that the committee has a very difficult problem to decide
what should be done with land which, though
substandard today, may be productive tomorrow. That is the only point I am endeavouring to make in this regard.
The honourable senator from Lumsden referred to certain lands which at one time
were thought to be unsuitable for production
because of long periods of drought to which
they were subject, but which, since the
period of dryness ended, and through changes
in methods of cultivation, have yielded produce worth millions of dollars. He also spoke
of areas which, while divided into small
farms, were not economically sound, but
when consolidated into larger units became
valuable farming territory. What could not
be operated profitably in small parcels became economically valuable when operated
with other land. In this connection I was
interested in the remarks of the honourable
senator from Westmorland, who pointed out
that in the 15 years from 1941 to 1956 the
number of farms in Canada was reduced
from 732,832 to 575,015, but with only a
slight reduction in the number of acres
under cultivation. That is to say, although
there were about 180,000 fewer individual
farms, the number of acres under cultivation had decreased very little. He also pointed
out that in the same period, even though
there had been a decline of 16 or 17 per
cent in the farm population, production from
the same acreage had increased by about
31 per cent. In short, if I correctly followed
his remarks, there are more acres under
cultivation, fewer farms, and from 16 to 17
per cent less people living on the farms.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: As a result of
mechanization?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Well, I think the
honourable senator from Westmorland mentioned two causes. One was improved
methods of farming; and I suppose in that
connection we should give credit to our
agricultural colleges, which so many of our
young farmers are able to attend. I shall
not name these colleges individually; indeed,
I could not do so; but I know that the Ontario
Agricultural College at Guelph, in my own
district, is rendering a splendid service to
the whole dominion, and, indeed, beyond
Canada as well, for among the students are
agriculturists from most of the other countries of the world, who are receiving
57075-4--43J

splendid training and taking their knowledge back home to make farming more
profitable in their own countries. These
agricultural colleges are rendering a splendid
service to young men and women who take
the opportunity of finishing their farm
education there.
The honourable Leader of the Government
(Hon. Mr. Aseltine) made some reference to
the increased use of modern farm equipment.
As I have given credit to the colleges I
should give credit also to the farm implement manufacturers.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Of Brantford?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: My honourable
friend has mentioned the city of Brantford.
I am proud to say there are two farm implement manufacturing companies in that
city. I hesitate to mention two companies
and not others, but as the honourable
gentleman mentioned my own city I am
forced to say that in Brantford we have one
of the largest branches of the MasseyFerguson Company. We have also the head
office of Cockshutt Farm Equipment Limited.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: Now under a British
company.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I will put it this
way. It is a company in which a British
organization now bas a considerable interest.
Hon. Mr. Bruni: The British company is
seeking control by asking for the election
of two extra directors.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I am not well informed with respect to the financial pages
of the newspapers, where no doubt my honourable friends get their information. I want
to say that both these companies have done
a lot of research work toward developing
first-class equipment that will produce more
crops with less work. Those who come from
farms are more familiar with this machinery
than I am but I think they will agree that
in recent years there has been quite an
improvement in labour-saving farm equipment. It has certainly enabled farmers to
produce more crops. I have sometimes thought
the discussions that take place between
farmers and implement manufacturers are
not well founded, for both the farmer and
the farm implement worker are engaged in
the same business, that of producing crops
and dairy products. The implement worker
has not got time to harvest crops and the
farmer is not in a position to manufacture
farm implements, but they are really working
together to produce more crops. In modern
times the implement worker has contributed
greatly to increased farm production.

SENATE
I was pleased that the committee gave
consideration to the problem involving the
use of good agricultural lands for the developnent of urban areas, highways, air fields,
and so on. It was suggested the other day
that the committee might, in the not too
distant future, have to give consideration to
the husbanding of land resources in so far
as agricultural lands are concerned. Well, I
do not think we have much time to spare,
for a great deal of good agricultural land,
especially fruit-growing land, bas already
been transferred to non-agricultural uses. The
problem is a difficult one. A farmer owns a
beautiful farm land, growing peaches, plums,
apples and pears, or a vineyard, and an
industry cornes along and off ers him a big
price for his land. Who is to say he shall
not sell it? That will be a very difficult
problem for this committee, even if it considers it in the near future. It occurs to
me that our highways department should
think twice before running roads through
beautiful fruit-growing or other farm lands,
especially wide highways of four or five or
six lanes, with junctions, whereby so much
land is taken up and lost to agriculture for
ever. There is not an unlimited amount of
good farm land in Canada. It is very sad
to go into certain parts of Ontario-for instance, between Toronto and Hamilton, and
Hamilton and Niagara Falls-and see so much
of this kind of land covered with houses, or
taken up by industry, or traversed by wide
highways.
Honourable senators, in closing I want to
commend the committee for the splendid
work it bas done. The committee recommends that its work should be continued in
the future. I quite agree with that. It bas
been suggested that the committee should
hold meetings not only in Ottawa but in
various parts of Canada. I am in accord with
that also. I feel, however, that before doing
so the committee should bring its proposal
directly to this bouse, and that the house
should think twice before giving the committee blanket authority to sit at any time
at any place. About three years ago the
Special Committee on the Traffic in Narcotic
Drugs sat in Vancouver, but the house gave
the committee authority to do so. If there is
to be a proposal that this Special Committee
on Land Use sit outside of Ottawa we should
know where the committee expects to sit.
I think that in such circumstances the committee would want the house to know just
what it planned to do.
Another suggestion has been that the committee should sit between now and the next
session of Parliament. I think that would be
an innovation; I do not know if it has ever
been done before.

Hon. Mr. Aseltine: It cannot be done.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: The Leader of the
Government says it cannot be done. If it is to
be done I think the bouse should give very
careful consideration to it after the committee itself has done so.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Doesn't a committee
become a nonentity the moment Parliament
prorogues?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: When Parliament
prorogues every committee is automatically
terminated, but a commission, I take it, could
be set up.
Hon. Mr. Aseliine: It would have to be a
royal commission.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I am not sure. It
might have to be a royal commission, composed of members of this house, or a royal
commission composed of members of both
bouses. The honourable senator from Ottawa
West (Hon. Mr. Connolly) has mentioned to
me that we once had a committee that sat
after prorogation to consider certain changes
in this chamber. That was an unofficial committee-shall I put it that way?
Hon. Mr. Lamberi: It never sat.
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): Oh, yes,
it did.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: The work was done,
in any event, but I do not think the committee actually had power to sit when the
bouse was not in session. I believe the bouse
just asked us to supervise the work which
had been authorized while the bouse was in
session.
Hon. Mr. Bruni: Just a body of senators.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Honourable senators,
I want to say that I commend highly the
work which this Committee on Land Use has
done up to the present time. There are big
problems ahead of it, and I am very pleased
to say that the members of the committee
are not afraid to tackle them.
Hon. John A. McDonald: Honourable senators, I have no speech prepared and I will
be brief. I would like to take this opportunity to emphasize the importance of carrying on the good work which has been so
well begun by this Land Use Committee.
If I may be excused for saying so, perhaps I can help honourable members of
this bouse to understand something of the
work that is still before this committee by
suggesting, for instance, what has to be done
in my own province. I give it as an example
because I know the conditions there better
than in some other parts of Canada.

AUGUST 26, 1958
I do not need to speak on the committee's
report, because the honourable Chairman of
the committee (Hon. Mr. Pearson), the
honourable senator from Westmorland (Hon.
Mr. Taylor) and the honourable Leader of
the Opposition (Hon. Mr. Macdonald) have
covered the ground very well, but I feel
that if I can bring home a little more clearly
to the honourable members of the house
what is necessary still to be done, it might
be of some use.
I think that, in order to help solve the very
important problems to be dealt with by the
Land Use Committee, its members might
wish to study what has been accomplished
in Nova Scotia and what still remains to
be accomplished there. They might wish
to see what has been done in the reclamation of lost land in that province as well
as in the neighbouring province of New
Brunswick. They might also wish to study
the soil survey work that has generally been
carried on in Nova Scotia. And while in the
province they might wish to visit leading
farmers and farm organizations, as well as
leaders in education on agriculture, and soil
chemists and other technicians. I am glad
the honourable senior senator from Ottawa
(Hon. Mr. Lambert) suggested this afternoon
that we owe a great debt to technical experts
in the provinces for what has already been
accomplished. Having had some considerable experience with trained Government
officials, both dominion and provincial, I can
say that although perhaps the farmers of
Canada are not doing things nearly as perfectly as they should, their efforts would
have been much less perfect but for the
assistance of these able specialists. I hope
that our Governments, both federal and
provincial, will see to it that no more of
these very valuable men are lost to Canada
because perhaps of unsatisfactory salaries
or working conditions. It is very, very
important to the future welfare of agriculture
in Canada that we keep these techniciansable men, and women too, that they are-in
our employ.
If a visit is made to the province of
Nova Scotia by this special committee-or
by a commission appointed by Order in
Council to sit after the committee has expired at the close of the session-it should,
I think, have meetings in at least four or
five places. I have no authority to say this;
I am merely suggesting, out of my own
experience, what I think should be done. I
think that a meeting should be held at the
Experimental Farm at Kentville, another at
the Experimental Farm at Nappan or at the
Agricultural College at Truro, and another
at Antigonish, where we have a very loyal
body of people associated with the Extension

Division of St. Francis Xavier University
who have given great aid to primary
producers, especially in the eastern part of
Nova Scotia. I would say that there should
be a meeting also on the Island of Cape
Breton, at some such centre as Mabou.
Perhaps from what I have said honourable
members will get an idea of what a vast
amount of work remains to be done if this
committee is going to accomplish what it
was set up to do.
I would like just to mention a couple
of other matters which are very important
to the primary producers of this country,
and it should not be necessary to await the
decisions of this committee before action is
taken on them. One of these matters has
been dealt with to a considerable extent
in both this house and the other place during
the present session. I refer to farm credit.
The technique in farming today requires
the use of expensive equipment, and the
farmer must be able to work a sufficient
acreage to employ this equipment during
enough days in the year to justify the heavy
cost. In many cases this means that, besides
laying out considerable money for equipment,
he must acquire additional land. Many lending organizations, which have done very well
the job that they were set up to do, say,
25 years ago, cannot adequately serve the
present-day farmer who has to make very
heavy expenditures.
Another point, which I brought up here
a short time ago, is that the provisions of
the Prairie Farm Rehabilitation Act, and also
the crop insurance provisions in the legislation applying to western farm lands, should
be made applicable to farms all over Canada.
In my opinion these two matters are very
important and there is need of dealing with
them very soon. I was glad to hear a short
time ago that the Government is giving attention to them at the present time and I hope
that action will not be delayed. Perhaps
the Leader of the Government in the Senate
(Hon. Mr. Aseltine) will convey to the appropriate ministers that we think-if there are
other members here who agree with me in
this matter-it is necessary to have these
matters dealt with promptly.
Honourable senators, I trust that the Land
Use Committee will have an opportunity to
complete the work that it was originally set
up to do.
Hon. Mr. Burchill: Honourable senators, I
would like to ask a question of my honourable friend from Kings (Hon. Mr. McDonald).
In his opinion, if the prices of farm products
were of the order that would justify farmers
in growing produce-in other words justify

SENATE
farmers in carrying on their business-would
the land problem in Nova Scotia not solve
itself?
Hon. Mr. McDonald: There are today very
many successful farmers in all provinces of
Canada. Unfortunately a number of young
farmers starting out find it difficult to get
the financial aid that they need in order to
secure sufficient acreage and the expensive
equipment needed to farm successfully today.
With the help of our agricultural colleges
in spreading agricultural education and with
the help of technicians, the farmers have
greatly improved their position and I am
glad to say that many of our better farmers
are in a much stronger position today than
they have been in years gone by.
Motion agreed to.

BUSINESS OF THE SENATE
Hon. W. M. Aselline: Honourable senators,
the legislation that we were expecting has
not yet arrived from the other place, and
I propose to move that the Senate adjourn
until tomorrow. Before doing that I would
like to say that the Standing Committee on
Banking and Commerce will meet tonight at
8 o'clock to consider two bills, the Customs
Tariff Bill and the Income Tax Bill, and that
tomorrow morning at 10.30 the same committee will meet to try to finish its work
on the Estate Tax Bill. It is possible that
the Broadcasting Bill and some other legislation will have been sent over here from the
Commons by tomorrow afternoon.
The Senate adjourned until tomorrow at
3 p.m.

SENATE

THE SENATE

Wednesday, August 27, 1958
The Senate met at 3 p.m., Hon. Lionel
Choquette, Acting Speaker, in the Chair.
Prayers.
BROADCASTING BILL
FIRST READING

The Hon. the Speaker informed the Senate
that a message had been received from the
House of Commons with Bill C-55, respecting broadcasting.
Bill read first time.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, when shall this bill be read the
second time?
MOTION FOR SECOND READING-DEBATE
ADJOURNED

Hon. Léon Méthol moved that the bill be
read the second time now.
He said: Honourable senators, this bill
will repeal the Canadian Broadcasting Act
and will create a new act which will, firstly,
establish an independent regulatory body
which will have authority over both the
Canadian Broadcasting Corporation and private television and radio, and will have
general supervision over all stations in Canada; secondly, it will create a Canadian
Broadcasting Corporation which will continue
to maintain and operate our national service.
In accordance with the existing act respecting broadcasting a corporation known
as the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation
was created, and this corporation had at
the same time the duty to carry a national
broadcasting service within Canada and to
control the private stations all over Canada.
This act will be repealed by the present bill,
which will come into force by proclamation
of the Governor General.
The purpose of the new act can be divided
into four points: 1. the establishment of a
Board of Broadcast Governors to ensure the
continued existence and efficient operations
of the national broadcasting system, and to
regulate the establishment and operation of
networks of the broadcast system; 2. the
creation of a staff of officers and employees
necessary for the proper conduct of the
business of the board; 3. the establishment
of a Canadian Broadcasting Corporation for
the purpose of operating the national broadcasting service; 4. the creation of a staff for
the conduct of the business of the corporation.

According to section 3 of the bill, the
Board of Governors appointed by the Governor in Council will consist of three fulltime members holding office during good
behaviour for a period of seven years, and
12 part-time members holding office during
good behaviour for a period of five years. The
full-time members shall be paid a salary
fixed by the Governor in Council. The parttime members shall be paid a fee of $100
per day each while attending a meeting of
the board.
This board will make regulations respecting times, standards and character of programs, and prescribe the terms and conditions
for operation of broadcasting stations.
An order of the board for the suspension
of a licence may be appealed to the Exchequer Court of Canada.
Officers and employees necessary for the
proper conduct of the business of the board
will be appointed under the provisions of
the Civil Service Act.
Under Part II, a corporation known as the
Canadian Broadcasting Corporation will be
established, and will consist of a President,
a Vice-President, and 9 other directors, appointed by the Governor in Council. The
President and Vice-President shall be appointed to hold office during pleasure for a
period of seven years. They are executive
officers charged with duties for which the
Government will be responsible. The other
directors shall be appointed to hold office
during good behaviour for a period of three
years.
This corporation is established for the purpose of operating our national broadcasting
service.
The corporation may, on its own behalf,
employ such officers and employees as it
considers necessary for the conduct of its
business. Any director, officer or employee
of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation
who was an employee within the meaning of
the Civil Service Act retains and is eligible
to receive all the benefits, except salary as
a civil servant, that he would have retained
or been eligible to receive had he remained
under the present Canadian Broadcasting Act.
The regulations made under the present
Canadian Broadcasting Act, and in force at
the coming into force of this act, shall continue in force until repealed or altered by the
Board of Broadcast Governors.
The existing corporation and the corporation to be established by this act are declared
for all purposes to be one and the same
corporation.
Honourable senators, I think I have outlined the main points of this measure. If
there are questions concerning the various
sections of the bill I will do my best to

AUGUST 27, 1958
answer them. The appropriate Government
officials will be available to give a detailed
explanation if the bill goes to committee.
Hon. David A. Croll: Honourable senators,
I wish to thank the sponsor of the bill (Hon.
Mr. Méthot) for outlining its purposes and
giving us a résumé of what it contains. Despite
the fact we have had the bill before us since
only yesterday, we are not unaware of what
its purpose is and what it contains. Frankly,
I have been a long-time supporter of the
C.B.C. and I believe the key TV channels
should be used in the public interest. The
C.B.C. has done an excellent job in the field
of information, entertainment and culture,
and it bas increased the desire of Canadians
for good music, drama and literature. It has
done more than that. It has developed Canadian talent, which is much appreciated at
home and abroad.
In speaking of the Canadian Broadcasting
Corporation it would only be right and proper
to say that Davidson Dunton, former Chairman of the corporation's Board of Governors,
by his devotion, understanding and integrity,
contributed much to make the C.B.C. what
it is today. He always stood up to whatever
Government was in office for what he believed
to be in the best interests of the C.B.C. This
country owes him a considerable debt.
I am one of those who believe that TV
must remain the property of the people, to
be developed and controlled by the people,
and not handled like TV across the border,
whiob is b,-ing developed andi ontrnllod b
the promoters of breakfast foods, soap, cigarettes, cosmetics and what have you. Broadcasting is one sector of our national life that
needs continuing public control. It was in
1932 that we decided to have a national
broadcasting system operated in the public
interest. This resulted from the Aird Report
of 1929. At that time, in order to complement
our national system on a local and regional
basis, privately-owned stations were permitted
to function under the control and as an
integrated part of our national system. The
private stations had no rights, they had a
privilege-a licence, if you like, but a very
profitable one indeed. The enjoyment of that
privilege over a period of years is now being
looked upon as a vested interest. Now the
private broadcasters claim that they have
rights. This bill, in my interpretation, will
create two national broadcasting systems, and
it will weaken the C.B.C. There are two
bodies set up, the Board of Broadcast Governors and the Board of Governors of the
C.B.C. There must be conflict between them.
One will represent the public interest, and the
other will represent, in the main, the private
interest.
57075-4-441

Hon. Mr. Bruni: Oh, no, that is not necessarily correct.
Hon. Mr. Croll: My friend says that is not
the intention. That is my interpretation of
the intention of the bill, because these private
interest people claim that they want competition-want to be allowed into the field in
order to give it competition. I think you will
find it rather interesting when I tell this house
that there is no record of a single case where
a private applicant seeking a licence has not
been opposed by broadcasters already in the
field. It is not competition that they are concerned with, they want a monopoly for themselves. This bill weakens the concept of
publicly owned and controlled national broadcasting, and it opens the door to a competitive,
privately owned system or network, which
may or may not have American attachment.
That will weaken our present system.
In addition, this bill leaves the C.B.C. open
to political interference, because now the
C.B.C. becomes an administrative and an
operative body, and the new board becomes a
supervisory and a regulatory body. I said
that it weakens the concept of public ownership. When honourable senators read through
the bill they will realize that there is confusion, there is uncertainty, and there should
be a certain amount of anxiety. Let me give
you an example. One section of the original
act-I haven't the number of the section here
-provided:
The corporation shall carry on a national broadcasting service-

It will be noted that the original act said it
"shall" do that.
Section 29(1) of this bill says:
The corporation is established for the purpose
of operating a national broadcasting service,-

Now, you may say it means the very same
thing. It may. On the other hand, it may not.
And so, by this bill, for the first time in 32
years we are handing over the exploitation
of the public domain to other bodies, and will
find, as in radio, that these TV licences and
franchises, will fall into the hands of great
controlled empires, and what we will have
instead of a public monopoly will be a private
monopoly.

It is a matter of knowledge and a matter
of record that private radio and TV have
never taken the rubber bands off the bank
roll, they have never made any attempt to
develop Canadian talent. They have left the
matter entirely in the hands of the Canadian
Broadcasting Corporation, which has done an
eminently fine job. Under this bill the C.B.C.
must go hat in hand every year to obtain
funds. It leaves the door open to meddling.
The C.B.C. needs to be financed over a period

expected to obtain from this legislation.

AUGUST 27, 1958
His answer was, "Not very much". I pointed
out to him that in a case like this, naturally
there were some taxpayers who would pay
more and others who would pay less; and
I asked him who were those who could pay
more and who were those who could pay
less. He told me that he would tell us
when the sections were called. I asked him
if this legislation was not a matter of pure
guessing and the department not sailing on
uncharted seas. He agreed with me to a
large extent.
I do not see the use of legislation like this,
which cannot be explained any better than
this was. It is full of technicalities. I shall
make similar observations on the other tax
bills. We never know where we are. The
departmental officials naturally say, "Well,
we will be able to answer you at a certain
time after the bill has been put into force".
There is an element of common sense in
that answer, but on the other hand it is
very dangerous to pass this kind of legislation in a hurry. Some officials of the Department of National Revenue always have the
same answer to requests that are made for
the consideration of complaints from this
gentleman or that lady with respect to the
operation of legislation that comes under that
department. They say: "You cannot complain; it is legislation that you Members
of Parliament have passed.
Period-30."
They forget that they were the ones who
drafted the legislation or had it drafted, and
that they could not give a satisfactory explanation of it when we were in committee.
That is my complaint.
We have not the same latitude as have the
members of the House of Commons with
regard to legislation, and I for one protest
against the mass of taxation legislation that
comes before us at the last moment of the
session. I appreciate the courtesy of the
honourable Leader of the Government (Hon.
Mr. Aseltine), and of his deputy (Hon. Mr.
Brunt), and even of the sponsor of the bill
(Hon. Mr. Méthot), when they deal with
these matters. But that is not enough. We
must know what is behind every piece of
legislation that comes before Parliament, and
for a very good reason, namely, that if any
citizen of Canada asked an honourable senator
for the kind of explanation that was asked
for in committee this morning, and he was
unable to make a satisfactory answer, he
would be put in a very embarrassing position.
This is not a question of pride, but a question
of service; it is a matter of doing our best for
every taxpayer in Canada. As I did not
get a satisfactory explanation in reply to
my request in the committee, I shall oppose
this legislation.

Hon. W. Ross Macdonald: Honourable senators, as the honourable senator from De la
Durantaye (Hon. Mr. Pouliot) has said, we
had before the committee this morning a
departmental representative who explained
the tariff changes proposed in this bill, and
it was difficult for us to obtain the information we desired. One of the difficulties was
caused by the form of the bill itself, and
this point was mentioned in committee.
Schedule A to the bill sets forth in several
pages various tariff items, followed by a
description of the product, and the three
tariffs, namely, British Preferential Tariff,
Most-Favoured-Nation Tariff and General
Tariff, and under each heading is stated the
rate of duty, if any. By the bill some tariff
rates have been increased, some have not
been changed but the wording with respect
to them has been changed, and other items
have been reduced. But from a reading of
this bill one cannot tell which items have
been increased, which remain the same, and
which have been decreased.
Honourable senators, it is my recollection-and I stand to be corrected if I am
wrong-that on previous occasions when a
bill of this nature came to the house it
contained a notation at the side of each item
showing the proposed change, if any, so that
when one picked up the bill he could read
it intelligently. Why that has not been done
in this bill, I do not know. As the honourable senator from De la Durantaye bas said,
we are near the end of the session, we are
very busy, and we do not have time to compare the proposed changes in the bill with
the act, item by item.
I appeal once again to the Leader of the
Government (Hon. Mr. Aseltine), that he
make a strong protest to the Minister of
National Revenue in this regard. Earlier
this session I protested against the form of
an interim supply bill. The honourable
leader was good enough to bring our protest-I was speaking on behalf of all honourable senators-to the attention of the Minister of Finance, and the last supply bill
dealt with in this house was in the form
which we suggested. I trust that when the
Customs Tariff Bill is presented to us next
session it will contain notes indicating the
proposed changes in the items enumerated.
Honourable senators, there is just one
tariff item to which I wish to refer: item
554b, which appears on page 8 of the bill,
in Part IV of Schedule A. It reads:
Woven fabrics composed wholly
yarns of wool or hair, n.o.p.

or in

part of

The rates are set out under the usual
three tariffs, and I note that the only proposed
change is under the British Preferential Tariff. That is, the tariff on these woven fabrics,

SENATE
so far as it relates to the United States and
other nations enjoying the Most-FavouredNation Tariff rates, remains unchanged, and
the rate under the General Tariff remains
unchanged, but the United Kingdom and other
countries of the commonwealth have been
singled out in that the duty against their
woollen fabrics has been increased. It is
said that the increase is insignificant. In terms
of dollars and cents it is, but, as was pointed
out in committee by the honourable senator
from Halifax-Dartmouth (Hon. Mr. Isnor), the
percentage of increase is 20 per cent. Under
the British Preferential Tariff the former rate
of 50 cents per pound has been increased
to 60 cents, so the tariff increase against
the United Kingdom and other commonwealth countries is 20 per cent.
Hon. Mr. Thorvaldson: That is, 20 per cent
of the tariff, not 20 per cent of the value
of the goods.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: The tariff has been
increased to the extent of 20 per cent.
Hon. Mr. Thorvaldson: No, that is not a
correct statement of itself, if you leave it at
that.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: The item says:
"The total duty leviable shall not be in excess
of, per pound, 60 cents."
Previously it was 50 cents, so that is an
increase of 10 cents, or 20 per cent.
Hon. Mr. Thorvaldson: On the tariff rate.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: 'On the tariff rate. I
thought that was what I was talking about.
In any event that was what I intended to
talk about. So, we all agree, the increase in
the tariff rate is 20 per cent.
Hon. Mr. Haig: State how much that will
affect us on the price of clothes.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I do not know how
it will affect the price of clothes, but I do
know it will affect the cost of these goods
from the United Kingdom and other British
Commonwealth countries to the extent of 20
per cent of the tariff rate.

manufacturer to profit by this increase I
am not sure. But if he is able to take advantage of the increase, it will add 30 cents,
we were told this morning, to the cost of an
overcoatHon. Mr. Hayden: No, that is the cloth.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: It will add 30 cents
to the cost of the cloth which is used in an
overcoat, and 15 cents to the cost of the
cloth used in a suit. That is practically
nothing, it is insignificant. Why, then, I
asked this morning-and could not get an
answer-was this higher duty imposed against
the United Kingdom and other commonwealth
countries? Was it done merely to annoy them
on the eve of the commonwealth trade conference? We have invited representatives of
all the commonwealth countries to come here
and discuss our trade problems, and a few
months before they are to meet us we set up
a partial roadblock which they will have to
encounter at the conference. We annoy them
by saying: "Before you ever come here to
talk about trade matters with us we are
making this increase. It is not very large."
I do not know why we are raising this tariff
against the commonwealth countries, but we
are doing so while we are saying: "Come
here so that we may talk about trade." Well,
honourable senators, to my mind it is not a
good policy, when inviting friends to your
house, to sit around the table and work out
arrangements to your own advantage, to do
something which is annoying to them. I think
it is a gross mistake on the part of the Government to ask Parliament to raise the duty
under these circumstances. The increase means
nothing to Canadian manufacturers-nothing,
I repeat. Speaking with one voice, the industry has said so. Then why give this minor
offence to those whom we have invited here
to discuss relations with us?

Hon. W. D. Euler: Honourable senators, I

textiles, but as far as I can see our imports
from the United States are not affected at all.
It was said in committee that certain negotiations are being conducted which might take
care of this situation.
Hon. Mr. Thorvaldson: Is the honourable
gentleman referring to textiles or woollens?
Hon. Mr. Euler: Woollen textiles. As I
understand it, nothing has been done about
cotton textiles. I dare say it is true that our
woollen textile imports from Britain, which
produces the best woollen textiles, are greater
than our woollen textile imports from the
United States, but a certain amount of clothing is imported from our neighbour to the
south.
The point I wish to make is that it is not
the proper function of the Tariff Board to
make recommendations. It can gather information upon which the Government can
form its policies, but I don't like to see the
Government use the board as a shelter behind
which to make policy changes for which it
doesn't want to be held responsible.
A point raised by the Leader of the Opposition (Hon. Mr. Macdonald), and one which
I myself referred to in committee, is the
almost unforgivable omission of explanatory
notes from the bill. One might even suspect
a motive for it. The pages on the left side
of the bill set out the three tariff rates which
will become effective if the bill is adopted,
but there are no explanatory notes to show
what the present rates are. I don't know of
another bill which has not contained explanatory notes on the proposed changes and
their effect. We were working pretty much
in the dark in committee this morning.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Quid pro quo.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Hear, hear.

petition to our manufacturers, perhaps even representative said he would take this into

the purpose of the Government to protect
the Canadian manufacturer? Was it to produce more revenue? We do not know. But if
the purpose of the tariff changes is to protect
the Canadian manufacturer, let us know it;
do not leave the duty of making recommendations to the board, which is not a policymaking body. Policy is and always must be
the function of government. It looks to meand in saying so I do not wish to be unkind
-that the Gavernment placed on the Tariff
Board a responsibility which the Government
itself ought to have assumed. Was the Government motivated by the idea that, if anybody should object to or criticize the changes
which have been proposed, it could plead
that they were made because the board had
recommended them? While the Government
has not so stated, I think it is perfectly plain
that the tariff increases are proposed with
the purpose of giving more protection-let
us frankly use the word-to domestic manufacturers.
It was said there were changes both upward
and downward. I asked why there were upward changes and whether they had been
made with the approval of the 40 or so countries subscribing to GATT, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. Incidentally, I
think GATT was brought about as a result of
a suggestion of the United States with the sole
purpose of having a general tariff reduction
among many countries of the world. At any
rate, I was told that to make tariff changes
on certain items it had been necessary to do
a bit of bargaining-

do something about this in the future. As
far as I am concerned, I also will bring the
matter to the attention of the proper department.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. AselIine: But, quite honestly, I
don't remember any other bill of this nature
having shown such information on the righthand pages.
Generally speaking, I thought we had a
good explanation in committee. The departmental official was frank in his answers.
He told us they made certain changes with
some countries, and that where there was
a raise there was also a corresponding reduction, a quid pro quo, and that, taking everything together in so far as revenue is concerned, there would not be any great
difference, that it would be an infinitesimal
amount.
With regard to the increased tariff on
woollen goods, I don't know just exactly
what advantage this would give to the
manufacturers of these goods in Canada. In
any event, it would mean only a few cents
more in the cost to the individual purchaser
of a suit of clothes or an overcoat, but the
overall effect might be of considerable advantage to Canadian manufacturers.
Hon. Mr. Euler: May I ask the leader a
question? I have said that it was neither fish
nor flesh nor good red herring. Is the
increase satisfactory to the importer or the
local manufacturer? Does it please the
Britisher who is sending his woollen goods
to Canada? I am not sure it does. If it
doesn't please the Canadian manufacturer,
neither side is satisfied and it really amounts
to nothing.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: We should have asked
that question of the officiai this morning.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: We did and he had
no answer.
Hon. John T. Haig: Honourable senators,
I want to make a few comments at this
time. I was interested in the remarks of the
honourable Leader of the Opposition (Hon.
Mr. Macdonald). The truth is we have a
number of woollen manufacturers in Canada and they have had an awful time in
the last three or four years. Textile factories
in practically every province have had to
struggle in order to keep their employees
at work. There may be strikes in other
industries but not in our textile industry.
The workers couldn't get anything anyway.
When I read in the press throughout the

country about tariff increases on woollen
goods I thought it was really something,
but this morning in committee we were told
that the cost of a woollen suit of clothes
would be increased by, I think, 30 cents.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: Fifteen cents.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Yes, I think actually on
a suit of clothes it was 15 cents.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Don't let 15 cents
come between us!
Hon. Mr. Haig: I think it was 15 cents on
a suit of clothes, and 30 cents on an overcoat. There is no need to go into hysterics
over that.
On the point made by the honourable senator from Waterloo (Hon. Mr. Euler), I think
it is the first time that I have heard of the
Tariff Board being asked to make a recommendation. It should have been made long
ago. The board's members are supposed to
be experts in hearing evidence. They hear
both sides of the story and they ascertain ail
the facts. Of course, the board bas not the
right to raise tariffs; and as a member said
this morning they do not make a recommendation until they are asked for it by the
minister; then the minister accepts or rejects
the suggestion as he sees fit. The minister
himself takes the responsibility, not the men
who make the recommendation. Ail that the
members of the Tariff Board do is hear the
case and on the facts give their judgment
on what should be done. I do not think there
is anything wrong with that; in fact, I am in
favour of it. If a man goes to a lawyer and
asks for an opinion, the lawyer will give him
an opinion, but the lawyer is not responsible
for what his client does with the opinion. If
the lawyer tells his client that in his opinion
the client is making a dishonest transaction,
and yet the client goes ahead with the dishonest transaction, the lawyer is not guilty
for the wrongdoing of his clients; in that case
it is the client who is guilty.
In the case of the minister asking for a
recommendation by the Tariff Board, I think
that is in the nature of a protection. I do
not believe the members of the board, or
anyone in a similar position, would give a
false recommendation to please the minister;
I think they would give the facts as they
found them.
Hon. Mr. Euler: That is not the point at ail.
Hon. Mr. Haig: They give a recommendation on the facts as they find them. They
hear both sides of the case, and anyone with
a complaint is heard; the applicants for an
increase, and those against it, are ail heard.
In this particular case the board studied this
problem, and they made a recommendation
saying that on woollens the tax on a suit of

AUGUST 27, 1958
clothes should be increased 15 cents, and the
tax on an overcoat, 30 cents. Those men
appeal to me as being the proper men to make
the recommendation. I say quite candidly
that I believe that a minister of any government would be delighted to have that
recommendation.
Hon. Mr. Euler: May I ask my friend a
question? What is the purpose of asking the
board to make a recommendation?
Hon. Mr. Haig: The members of the board
are experienced. The purpose is to get the
facts from the best evidence available in the
country.
Hon. Mr. Euler: To serve what purpose?
Hon. Mr. Haig: To serve the best interests
of the country, nothing else.
Hon. Mr. Euler: You mean, to protect the
industry? That is what I am getting at.
Hon. Mr. Haig: No, certainly not. My friend
is completely wrong.
Hon. Mr. Euler: No.
Hon. Mr. Haig: My friend and all his associates try to say that it is all done to help
someone to get some political assistance in his
county. Now, that is not true. If a politician
is the proper kind of a member of Parliament,
he does it in the best interests of the country.
Hon. Mr. Euler: If my friend is suggesting
that I would take that attitude, he certainly
is quite wrong.
Hon. Mr. Haig: The honourable senator
from Winnipeg South (Hon. Mr. Thorvaldson)
said the other day that there had been no
substantial change in the tariff in the past
25, 30 or 40 years, that the Liberal Government made some changes and the Conservative Government made others. But I think
that what we were told this morning was
one of the best things I have ever heard of.
It is the first time to my knowledge that the
Tariff Board, on the request of the minister,
made a recommendation as to what it thought
should be done. I think the members of that
board are the best qualified people to make
that recommendation.
Honourable senators, the total of the increase and the total of the decrease in taxation under this bill is practically nil. The
representative of the Government who came
before the committee this morning is a very
able man, and he made it quite clear there
was very little change. In fact, I think there
are more items affected by reductions than
by increases, but there may be more increases than in the past, and therefore the
total may be evened up. Some of the recommendations of the officials were adopted, some
changed, and some refused altogether. That is

what you would expect from a minister who
has the interest of the whole of Canada at
heart.
I think we are making too much out of so
small a matter. I would not say we are introducing a tariff by changing the rates of a
few items one way or the other, such as 30
cents on an overcoat and 15 cents on a suit
of clothes. If that is all the Conservative
party does in the next five or ten years, it
won't do very much. I am not saying it is
not right in doing so, but I say that such
changes as that do not mean much, and that
it is making a mountain out of a molehill.
There are a great many manufacturers in
our city of Winnipeg, as well as in other
western cities, and they are just as interested
in tariff protection as are Ontario, Quebec and
the Maritime provinces. I am in favour of sufficient protection only in order that our industries can compete with foreign competition.
That is all I want. If we have to pay twice
as much for steel manufactured in Canada
as that manufactured in Germany we shall be
unable to compete. We have to face that fact.
To protect ourselves we must either put a
tariff on steel coming from Germany or go
out of business. That is the issue. Similarly,
if cheaper goods than ours can be manufactured in the United States, we must meet
that competition or go out of business. Germany is now selling goods to the Middle East
and at the same time lending it money. That
is what is happening between the United
States and Canada with regard to wheat. It
may be said that the western farmers need
help to market their wheat. You do not need
to help us. If you will stop other people sending their goods into Canada, they will soon
come around and give us a good deal on our
wheat.
We have to face the fact that we must compete with other countries in the marketing
of our goods. Britain is shipping automobiles
to Canada and the United States. That is
creating fierce competition in that industry in
both countries. That is the situation that
exists, and we must face it. No doubt a labour
problem is involved there. I am not against
labour, and I want to see it get a reasonable
deal, but we are compelled to face conditions
in the woollen industry in this country. There
is a woollen mill situated not far from here,
in Lanark county, at Perth, I think it is. The
people working in that mill have had no
increase in pay for years because they realize
that the minute their pay goes up the cost
of their product goes up and their goods
cannot be manufactured to compete with
imported goods.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Do you think that this
legislation will help that situation?

SENATE
Hon. Mr. Haig: This will help them very
little, I admit, but at least it is an indication
that the Government is thinking about the
problem. The Government may not do much
for it but at least it knows about it. Sometimes I have wondered if the Government
knows about it.
For these reasons I hate to see an issue
brought up that does not mean much, if anything, to anybody. I want the people on
the prairies to know all about this increase
in the cost of a suit, and I am going to ask
my dear friends of the Free Press to publish
the fact that the total tariff increase on a
suit of clothes by reason of the increase under
this bill will be 15 cents, and 30 cents on
an overcoat. I also want the Liberal papers
across Canada to publish that information. It
is, as my friend said, an increase of 20 per
cent over the present rate, but that is not the
point. The point is, how much more does a
suit cost me by reason of this tariff increase?
Well, the answer to that question is that it
will cost me 15 cents more for a suit and
30 cents more for an overcoat. Those are
the facts that should be brought home.
Honourable senators, I feel that the Government has done very well on this. I liked
the man who appeared before us in committee
this morning.

piece of legislation well. Again I say I will

Hon. Mr. Isnor: Honourable senators, I
have a question to ask the Leader of the
Government (Hon. Mr. Aseltine). What will
this increase on woollens amount to in dollars
and cents, the overall increase which the
consumers will have to pay? Is it not a
million dollars?
Hon. Mr. Aseline: I do not know the cost
of cloth and all that kind of thing.
Hon. Mr. Isnor: Perhaps your memory then
will serve as well as mine. I understood
the witness to say this morning that this
increase in the tariff will cost the consumers
$1 million.
Hon. Mr. Bruni: No. He said the increase
in the tariff if applied to the production of
woollens in Canada would amount to $1
million.
Hon. Mr. Isnor: That is the same thing. It
will cost the consumers $1 million.

AUGUST 27, 1958
REPORT OF COMMITTEE

Hon. Salter A. Hayden presented a further
report of the Standing Committee on Banking
and Commerce on Bill C-39, respecting the
Income Tax Act.
The report was read by the Clerk Assistant
as follows:
The Standing Committee on Banking and Commerce, to whom was referred the Bill (C-39)
intituled: "An Act to amend the Income Tax Act",
have in obedience to the order of reference of
August 21, 1958, examined the said bill, and now
report the same without any amendment.
BILL REFERRED BACK TO COMMITTEE

The Hon. the Acting Spaaker: Honourable
senators, when shall this bill be read the
third time?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Now.
Hon. Mr. Bruni: Honourable senators, I
move that the report be not now adopted but
that the bill be referred back to the Standing Committee on Banking and Commerce
for the sole purpose of reconsidering section
41. That is the section concerning the $10,000
gift to a spouse or a child or children. We
could deal with. that in committee this
evening before we resumed consideration of
the Estate Tax Bill and it could be returned
to the Senate tomorrow, so there would be
no undue delay. Two problems have arisen
in connection with this particular section
since it was heard by the committee.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: From what the mover
of the amendment has said, I do not know
why the bill should be referred back to
committee. Personally I do not like the wording in the bill, but it was passed by the
committee and I am not aware of any reason
for sending it back. If there is any good
reason I will support my friend's motion, but
not otherwise.
Hon. Mr. Bruni: Honourable senators, there
are grave doubts that section 41 applies in a
case where a farmer's son buys a farm and
the farmer loans him $10,000 for that purpose
on a mortgage, and the mortgage is discharged. That is the first point.
Secondly, there is even greater doubt
whether the section applies in a situation
where a wife signs an offer to purchase a
piece of property to be used as a home, her
husband gives her $10,000 for the purpose of
paying for the home, the transaction is completed, and the deed is made by the vendor
directly to the wife.
Those are two situations, honourable senators, which I think it would be wise to
have cleared up before the bill is given
third reading.

Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Those points were considered.
Hon. Mr. Bruni: No.
Hon. Mr. Croll: The second situation could
be easily dealt with. In such a case the
husband, instead of the wife, could buy the
property and turn it over to her, and
thereby come within the four corners of the
bill.
On the first point, may I say it is difficult
to spell out the law so that we know exactly
what it means under every circumstance.
Would we not be just as well off to go
along with the bill? We are a continuing
body, so if there is any difficulty we can
correct the matter on another occasion. I
think the first example given by the honourable senator comes within the bill, and I
imagine he thinks so too. However, I cannot be sure.
Hon. Mr. Bruni: I have my doubts about
it.
Hon. Mr. Croll: I have doubts too; in fact,
I have doubts about every taxing section I
ever read.
Hon. Mr. Haig: If my honourable friend
from Hanover (Hon. Mr. Brunt) wants to
make a change in this section he can refer
the bill to the Committee of the Whole and
there we can make any necessary correction.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: Did the honourable
senator from Hanover consult the officials of
the department with respect to this clause
after the committee meeting this morning?
Hon. Mr. Bruni: No, I did not.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: If there is any doubt
about the effect of this section, I think the
bill should be sent back to committee and
have the officials clear up the point to the
satisfaction of even a minority of the committee.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: Honourable senators, if
it is the wish of the house that this report
be referred back to the committee, I have no
objection, but on the grounds which have
been raised for sending it back I have a few
words to say.
As to the second example given by the
honourable senator from Hanover (Hon. Mr.
Brunt), it would be a simple matter for the
husband to contract to purchase the property,
and by direction to the vendor have the
property conveyed to the wife; he could put
up his money at the appropriate time, make
the payment, and direct that the deed be
made in the name of the wife.
Hon. Mr. Bruni: I doubt if that situation
would be covered. That is not a transfer.

SENATE
Hon. Mr. Hayden: It might be an assignment of interest in land.
As to the first example, we did get an
opinion in committee last evening-true, it
was an arm-chair opinion-from the head of
the legal section in the Taxation Division,
as to the effect of the bill on such a case
and the opinion expressed, though not final
or binding in any way, was that this type
of case came within the provisions of section 41.
Hon. Mr. Brunt: But no officials from the
Department of Justice were present.

Hon. Mr. Pouliot: Honourable senators,
before the motion is passed I wish to compliment the honourable senator from Hanover
(Hon. Mr. Brunt), not because of the merit
of the views which he has expressed but
because he has shown that he is just as openminded to suggestions as is the honourable
leader of the Government in this house (Hon.
Mr. Aseltine). In the past year we have not
been spoiled in that respect. This may be
why we appreciate so much the spirit of confraternity and good will in his suggestion
that the bill be referred back to the committee. It is on account of the fact that I
appreciate so deeply his good disposition that
I will not oppose the motion.
Motion agreed to.

Hon. Mr. Croll: We are justice!
Hon. Mr. Thorvaldson: The honourable senator from Toronto-Spadina (Hon. Mr. Croll)
and the honourable senator from Toronto
(Hon. Mr. Hayden) have indicated their views

there seems to be considerable doubt now

has been said by the honourable senator from
Toronto-Spadina (Hon. Mr. Croll) and others
who have spoken, but it would do no harm
to have the bill sent back to the committee,
and in the circumstances my view is that
it should be sent back.
Hon. Mr. Dupuis: Honourable senators, I
am not a member of the committee. Therefore,
may I ask if a debate took place in the
committee as to the conflict between the law
under the Civil Code of Quebec and the
principles of this bill as to the right of a
husband to transfer property to his wife?

it.

Hon. Mr. Dupuis: And was it agreed to?

Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Honourable senators,
with leave of the Senate, I move an amendment to the notice of motion that stands
in my name for the amendment of the Rules
of the Senate. The amendment is required
because I overlooked the fact that Rule 79
in part has to do with Special Committees,
which are in a little different position as to

The proposed Rule 79 in the notice of
motion which was placed on the Order Paper
two days ago reads as follows:
79. Every Standing or Special Committee meets,
if practical, on the next sitting day after appointment and chooses a chairman.

That does not go far enough in respect of
Special Committees. It will be noticed that
the present rule provides a quorum for both
Standing and Special Committees, the quorum
to be a majority of senators appointed on
each committee. With the amendment of Rule
78 as proposed in the motion the quorum for
Standing Committees will be fixed by that
rule; and in so far as Rule 79 is concerned it

will simply direct the members to meet and
choose a chairman; but it gives no direction
to a Special Committee as to what the quorum
of that committee shall be. The purpose of
the amendment in the notice is to redraft
a quorum from the Standing Committees. My the proposed Rule 79 as I have already
indicated.
amendment reads:
As I have said, subclause (1) is needed with

(2) Every Special Committee meets, If practical,

By way of explanation of this amendment
I will read the present Rule 79:

Hon. Thomas Vien: Honourable senators, I
concur fully in what the honourable senator
just said. Legislation should be drafted so
as to be intelligible to those to whom it
applies. In many cases, particularly in money
bills-customs, excise, and other bills of that
kind-the draftsmen generally amend, say,
section 3(a), (b), (c) or (d) by dropping a word
or two, or adding a line or two, and the
amendment is quite unintelligible, not only to
laymen but even to professional men, unless
one refers to the text of the section that is
being amended.
I suggest that in an amending bill every
section or clause that is amended should be
completely repealed and a new section or
clause substituted therefor. Further, the bill
should contain explanatory notes explaining the purpose of the amendment. From
now on I think the text of every section that
is being amended should be before honourable members of this house when the amendment is under consideration.
I do not blame the present Government
or the past Government, for I think that
what was done in this instance has been the
practice since Confederation. It seems to me
that the technicians of the Department of
National Revenue and the technicians of the
Department of Justice want to make amendments unintelligible except to technicians. I
feel that attention should be drawn to this.
I repeat my suggestion that, in order to avoid
confusion, an amending bill should repeal
every section or clause that it is proposed to
amend and enact a substitute therefor, and
every such amendment should be accompanied by an explanatory note setting out the
purpose of the amendment.

Your committee recommend that the ninister take

the Trust Companies Association of Canada and
the Canadian Bar Association) are made acquainted,

18 thereof.

The Hon. the Acting Speaker: Honourable
senators, when shall these amendments be
taken into consideration?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: Honourable senators, I
move that the amendments be concurred
m now.
Hon. W. M. Aselline: Honourable senators,
the report contains quite a few amendments
made to this important measure and it is my
opinion that they should be considered
seriatim. The only way that can be done is
to have the amendments committed to a
Committee of the Whole. I intend to move a
motion in amendment for that purpose. This
procedure has been followed on many previous occasions and has proved a very satisfactory manner of dealing with an important
measure of this kind, involving a number of
amendments. It is particularly applicable in
this instance, where one of the proposed
amendments is very controversial.
Therefore, honourable senators, I move,
seconded by the Honourable Senator Thorvaldson, that the said amendments be not
now concurred in, but that they be committed
to a Committee of the Whole presently.
Motion in amendment agreed to.
CONSIDERED IN COMMITTEE

The Senate went into committee on the
amendments.

On the committee's fourth amendment:
Page 26, line 21. Strike out line 21 and substitute therefor: "made for or on account of income
tax, except where a superannuation or pension
benefit is taxable under the Income Tax Act."

Hon. Gunnar S. Thorvaldson: Honourable
senators, I would like to express opposition
to this amendment.
As is well known to the house, this bill
was carefully examined and scrutinized by
the Standing Committee on Banking and
Commerce. Many amendments were made
to the bill and accepted by the Minister of
Finance, which amendments make many
provisions of the bill more workable and, in
various procedural aspects, more fair to the
citizen taxpayer.
These amendments exemplify, at least to
me, the value of a sober second thought in
regard to legislation and the revising capacity of the Senate. Indeed, I was struck by
the comments of a number of the departmental officials in their recognition of the
knowledge and experience brought to bear
upon many of the problems of estate taxation by various senators. That is, I am sure,
undoubted.
But one of the amendments, namely, that
proposed to clause 26 of the bill, is not, as is
now well known, acceptable to the Government. There are two reasons for its nonacceptance. In the first place, it is claimed
that the amendment would create a preferred
class of property and, secondly, that it would
involve discrimination against other classes
of property. I should like to mention a few
of the kinds of property which it is deemed
would be discriminated against.
The first, a very common one, is the
This
registered retirement savings fund.
type of fund is becoming very popular, and
recently elaborate provision has been made
by Parliament for payments to be made into
such funds without payment of tax. Nevertheless such plans, clearly, are not included
in this amendment, and, therefore I say they
are definitely discriminated against.
Another type of property which is discriminated against is, for instance, the lumpsum withdrawal of a pension fund. In the
event of the withdrawal of such a fund in
a lump sum-and many plans give the right
of withdrawal in this form-this section
allows no benefit to such type of property.
Thirdly, there is the ordinary Government
annuity. As honourable senators know, there
is an element of taxation in regard to this
kind of asset. The amount which a buyer
pays for an annuity is, of course, capital, and
when withdrawn is not taxable, but the interest portion of the annuity is taxable.
Hon. Mr. Bruni: Only if it was purchased
after 1932. Is that not correct?

AUGUST 28, 1958
Hon. Mr. Thorvaldson: Yes; but as everyone
knows millions of dollars' worth of these
annuities have been purchased by the people
of Canada since 1932. The interest portion
of that type of property is not affected by
this amendment, so I contend that there is
clear discrimination in respect of property of
this kind.
Another type of property which is discriminated against is renewal premiums of
insurance salesmen received by their widows
after the death of their husbands. This kind
of asset is possessed by nearly all widows of
insurance salesmen. When they come into
an estate they are not affected by this
amendment.
Fifthly, there are payments such as rent
from a property for a certain period. For example, the capital element of a property may
be devised to one person or indeed to a
charity with a provision that rent from it is
to be payable to the widow or family for a
period of time. An asset of that kind is not
affected by this amendment; and this, I say,
constitutes discrimination.
Sixthly, there are properties whose market
values are not readily ascertainable. Some
bonds are in this category. Their value cannot be readily discovered from market action
and they have to be valued independently of
the market. Also there are shares whose value
must be ascertained apart from stock market
quotations. There is the case of income from,
say, an apartment building, or a rented home.
Valuations of properties of this kind are made
without respect to whether the recipient of
the revenue from them has to pay income tax
or not. It is exactly the same thing; the principle is identical; the fact that income tax is
payable from revenues on any of these properties is not taken into account for valuation
purposes.
I have given six instances of discrimination
in relation to properties which are affected by
this amendment, and these provide one of
the main reasons why the department and
the Government are not prepared to accept
the amendment of the section which has
been made by the Committee.
So much for the matter of discrimination.
Then there is the question which was discussed in the committee last evening, namely,
the power or, apart from power, the theoretical aspect of the Senate's right to deal with
ways and means, or the question of how far
it should go in dealing with a problem that
affects ways and means. As a very junior
senator I do not propose to discuss that problem, but I would refer honourable senators
to the very clear, concise and complete statement which was made in regard to this question by the honourable the Leader of the
Opposition (Hon. Mr. Macdonald) in 1956

and reported at page 1029 of the Senate
Hansard of that year. I think it is fairly
authoritative. It is perhaps true that the provision in the British North America Act relating to the Senate's power in respect of
money bills would seem to limit those powers
to a restriction on the imposition of taxes,
but it should be remembered that in this day
and age, when taxes are reduced, it simply
means that other taxes are imposed on other
people; and from that point of view it seems
to me that tax reductions affect ways and
means.
Hon. Mr. Euler: May I point out that if that
theory is correct the Senate cannot make
any reduction in taxation, because it would
involve some increase in taxes which are
beyond the powers of this house. Consequently there would be no possible use in
bringing a money bill into this house, because,
on this assumption, it could not be dealt
with if a reduction was effected, and certainly
not if there was an increase.
Hon. Mr. Thorvaldson: I am not saying
that the honourable senator may not be right
in the view he has expressed. The problem
is a big one, and I do not feel as well equipped
to discuss it as members with longer experience here. That is why I referred honourable senators to the statement made by
the honourable Leader of the Opposition two
years ago.
Before I conclude, may I say something
with regard to the amendment of this section
which the committee presumed to make? In
doing so I desire to reiterate the remarks
made at the opening of the house today by
the honourable senator from De la Durantaye
(Hon. Mr. Pouliot) about the inherent danger
of making changes or amendments to taxing
statutes in committees or in the house. It is
a dangerous practice indeed, at least without
discussing the wording of proposed amendments with the law officers of the Crown
who are in charge of the legislation in
question.
Let me read what has been done in regard
to section 26. This is how the section read
in the bill when it came to the Senate:
For the purposes of this Part, in determining the
value of any property no allowance or deduction
shall be made for or on acount of income tax.

That is a clear statement. Now I will
read the section as amended by the Banking
and Commerce Committee:
For the purposes of this Part, in determining the
value of any property no allowance or deduction
shall be made for or on account of income tax,

That is exactly the same wording so far.
Then comes these additional words:
-except where a superannuation or pension benefit is taxable under the Income Tax Act.

SENATE
The point I want to make is there is nothing
in the amendment which authorizes the department to do anything in regard to those
things. To explain my position I just want
to say that any change of taxation which
might be made by this amendment is simply
by inference. There is no positive statement
that a certain thing can or cannot be done.
It simply creates an exception which is absolutely meaningless unless words such as
these are added-and I think if they were
added the amendment would become meaningful:
-in the case of which an allowance shall be
made in respect of the income tax payable thereon.

Hon. Mr. Bruni: Would the honourable
gentleman mind repeating that slowly?
Hon. Mr. Thorvaldson: The words are:
-in the case of which an allowance shall be
made in respect of income tax payable thereon.

I have no desire to help the committee
in drafting an amendment to this section, but
I do suggest that the amendment as drafted
leaves the section completely, wholly and
utterly meaningless. It would mean absolutely nothing. I have just referred to it
because both the honourable senator from
De la Durantaye (Hon. Mr. Pouliot) and the
honourable senator from De Lorimier (Hon.
Mr. Vien) referred to the dangers of amending taxing statutes without complete and full
consultation with the law officers of the
Crown.
In conclusion I want to say that the Estate
Tax Bill is a good one.
Hon. Mr. Bruni: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Thorvaldson: It is a great improvement on the law of this country in
respect to the taxing of estates, or what we
have heretofore referred to as succession
duties. A large majority of Canadians want
this bill to be enacted at this session. Many
organizations throughout this country, which
were referred to in the report, have been
appearing for a period of some six to eight
months before the Minister of Finance and
departmental officials in regard to this legislation. They have made innumerable suggestions for amending and improving the bill
and many of their proposals have been accepted by the Government. The majority of the
amendments suggested by the Senate Banking
and Commerce Committee are, in my opinion,
excellent. They will be useful in the administration of the act and will ease certain
situations for the taxpayer which need to be
eased. Notwithstanding this, we have this
one amendment which I say is meaningless,
which it is proposed to impose on the Government despite the fact that it is pretty
well known that it cannot possibly be accepted by the Government.

Honourable senators, I do submit that this
bill should be allowed to pass this session and
that the Senate should not do something now
which would prevent its passage.
Hon. T. D'Arcy Leonard: Honourable senators, as the mover in committee of the
amendment to section 26 I would like the
privilege of replying to the remarks just
made by the honourable senator from Winnipeg South (Hon. Mr. Thorvaldson). First
of all, may I compliment him upon presenting
his case with his usual clarity. I am glad
to have this opportunity to speak and I hope
to make clear the desirability of this particular amendment.
Perhaps I should start by commenting on
the honourable gentleman's statement that
this is a good bill and that the other amendments the Senate Banking and Commerce
Committee has made are excellent. I agree
wholeheartedly. This is a good bill. Ever
since 1940 I have consistently advocated the
principle of estate tax as a federal tax on
inheritance. I am glad to compliment the
minister and his officials on the work they
have done to supplant the sucession duty
legislation with this estate tax measure. In
my opinion it is a definite improvement, not
only as to the principle of taxation. It includes desirable changes with regard to the
taxing of the property of a person passing
on death. I refer to increased deductions, the
joint interest of the deceased in property, and
the 15 per cent tax on property of nonresidents in lieu of a graded tax. Those are
desirable amendments.
I turn now to section 26 of the bill. In
my opinion the amendment under discussion
improves the section. Let me give my explanation of what the amendment does. The
original section contained a provision having
an effect similar to one that has been in the
Sucession Duty Act since 1952. That provision
is that in determining the value of any
property covered by that part of the legislation no allowance or deduction shall be made
for on account of income tax. The amendment which was made in the Banking and
Commerce Committee added the words
"except where a superannuation or pension
benefit is taxable under the Income Tax Act".
The effect of this amendment is that in the
case of a superannuation or pension benefit
which has at the time of death, a built-in
tax liability or payment of future income tax
on the capital element of that pension benefit,
such liability can be taken into account in
ascertaining the value for estate purposes
of that superannuation or pension benefit.
That is the intention of this amendment.
Let me illustrate what that means by referring to a case which was put forward in
our Banking and Commerce Committee. This

AUGUST 28, 1958
is a case which actually occurred. A manwe may call him "John Doe"-died on August 1, 1958. Among the assets of his estate
was a pension insurance policy in the amount
of $34,282.72. This policy was purchased entirely with funds upon which no income tax
was paid.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: What was the total value
of that estate?
Hon. Mr. Leonard: I was told the estate
was approximately $100,000. Perhaps that has
some relevance to my honourable friend. It
has no relevance to me as far as the matter
of double tax of an asset is concerned.
In that case income tax will now have to
be paid on this sum of $34,282.72. That is
quite right and proper, and there is no quarrel with that aspect of the case. It is estimated that income tax will amount to $11,700.
The succession duty office proposes, in accordance with the provisions of the present
Dominion Succession Duty Act, to charge duty
on the full value of $34,282.72, and to make
no deduction from that value for the income
tax of $11,700, which has ta be paid. Now,
had the deceased withdrawn the $34,282.72
a month before he died, or indeed at any
time before he died, he would have paid
$11,700 income tax and the resulting net value
to his estate would have been only $22,582,
and that is the amount on which he would
have paid succession duty. My illustration
happens to deal with a commutable pension
policy, that is, one which in certain circumstances can be cashed in, but the same result
would follow even if that policy had been
payable over a period of years. There is no
doubt that if in valuing the annuity no allowance is made for the built-in tax liability,
there is in effect a tax on a tax.
Honourable senators, I went back to 1952
to see the reasons given at that time for the
introduction of this provision whereby no
allowance was to be made on account of
income tax. I had a recollection that it was
to cover the type of case of a company having an accumulated surplus. In so far as I
have been able to ascertain, from reading
the debates, that is the type of case mentioned by the then Minister of Finance, the
Honourable Mr. Abbott. I find that in the
House of Commons debates of May 26, 1952,
at page 2598, in describing the operation of
section 33, which is now the equivalent of
section 26, the minister said.
This amendment is to spell out in our act, as
I know it is spelled out in the Ontario act, the
provision that under such circumstances no account
shall be taken of a possible liability for income
tax when profits are distributed. For obvious
reasons I think that could not be taken Into
account because the arount of income tax which

would be payable would depend upon the bracket
in which the individual shareholder happened to
be, what other income he had, and so on. Therefore there is a means now available in the law
to enable people in that position to protect themselves against excessive liability for both succession
duties and income tax.
In answer to my hon. friend's question, it Is
and always has been the law that the fair market
value must include whatever is in the assets of
a company at the time of death and that no
account shall be taken of any potential incorne
tax liability.

Then Mrs. Fairclough asked:
Why was this clause necessary? Were there certain circumstances under which the income tax
payable was deducted twice?

Mr. Abbott replied as follows:
There was a case in one of the provinces, I
believe British Columbia, where it was held that
might be the result of our law as enacted at the
present time. This section is putting into our law
what I know is in the Ontario law.

Hon. Mr. Haig: May I ask the honourable
member a question? Was income tax paid on
that amount of $34,000 during the lifetime
of the insured?
Hon. Mr. Leonard: No income tax was paid
on that in his lifetime, and therefore it
became payable after death. Had it been
paid in his lifetime the succession duties on
the amount of income tax paid would have
been less.
Now, the effect of this section has been to
apply not only to the case of the valuation
of shares to the company, but also, of course,
to this type of case where there is an income
tax liability in connection with superannuation or pension benefit. Notwithstanding a
good many cases of unfairness which have
arisen I think there are two reasons why
the amendment has not been made hitherto.
One is that there is still some confusion in
thinking as to the two types of property, and
as to two types of pension benefits. With due
respect, I suggest that the honourable senator from Winnipeg South (Hon. Mr. Thorvaldson) has had some of that confusion
between the types of property in the remarks
he made. You can have a pension benefit
which has been provided by tax-paid money,
that is, where income tax has been paid upon
the money, and in that case the full value
of the pension, naturally, should be taxable
in the estate. But in that case, because the
income tax has been paid, the capital value of
the estate for estate tax purposes will be less
than otherwise it would be, by the amount of
income tax paid on the purchase money.
Coming back to the $34,000 case of Mr. Doe,
he could have bought an annuity immediately
prior to his death with money upon which
incnme tax had been paid, and in that case,

SENATE
the full value of the annuity would be taxed
for estate tax purposes, but he would have
been out the $11,000 he had already paid, his
estate would be less by that amount. It is
because, instead of paying it in his lifetime,
he defers it, that this question of double
tax arises. Income tax liability is still a
debt against that particular asset because it
is built into the asset and the pension amount
cannot be withdrawn without paying that
income tax. On other assets, such as the rent
of a house, or income from shares and bonds,
income tax is paid on earnings subsequent
to death. In this one particular type of asset,
there is a built-in liability, existing at the
time of death, and the asset cannot be realized
upon except on payment of the tax.
The honourable senator from WinnipegSouth also referred to the matter of ways
and means. Last night in committee Dr.
Eaton said-and I think I am quoting him
correctly-that the effect of this new bill on
the current fiscal operations would be, I
will not say negligible, but not of any great
effect. That is natural. After the bill has
been passed a certain period of time must
elapse while the public is being informed of
this new type of estate legislation so that
wills may be changed and proper provisions
made in the light of the new legislation.
It will apply only to those persons dying
after that time has elapsed and the act comes
into effect. There is a period of six months
allowed for the payment of the tax on the
estates of those persons, and this particular
amendment in itself, even in a full year of
operation, could not be of any great consequence in the overall picture, even though it
might be of very considerable importance to
the individual taxpayer.
In this house and in the Banking and
Commerce Committee we have dealt with
this amendment on non-party lines. The
sarne argument which I put with respect to
the double tax was put by the honourable
senator from Hanover (Hon. Mr. Brunt) on
second reading, and he put it more cogently
than I could. Our debate and our division
crossed party lines. As far as I am concerned I put the amendment forward for
purely personal reasons because I thought
it was the proper thing to do. I hold no
brief for anyone, except that I think a good
many annuitants and people on pensions are
now and have in the past been unfairly
dealt with, and will be unfairly dealt with
in the future unless this amendment is
adopted. There is a growing number of
these pension plans in industry. A very
large percentage of our wage earners and
salaried people in Canada are now covered
by pension plans, and nearly all the plans
are based on the principle that an allowance

is made from income tax during lifetime or
during the time in which the employees are
contributing to the pension plan, and income
tax is payable thereafter when the pension
is received. It is on their account alone I
think some proper amendment should be
made.
As far as I know there is in fact no discrimination against other forms of property
by this amendment. The present act, of
course, in section 34(3) discriminates against
this type of property. It may be that other
types of property are also being discriminated
against by section 34(3) of the present act.
If so, probably they should be treated in the
same way as superannuation and pension
benefits. That does not make this provision
any worse.
I was interested in going back to the House
of Commons debates of 1952 and reading some
of the comment which took place when
budget resolutions were discussed. Mrs. Ellen
Fairclough, now the Honourable Ellen Fairclough had this to say, as reported at page
1554 of the House of Commons Hansard, 1952
session.
We assume that a man purchases a pension payable to himself on retirement or to his estate upon
his demise. The pension was provided, let us say,
by tax-free contributions, and therefore it is fully
taxable as income when it is received. Well, that
is all quite regular; it is an accepted fact, and
the purchaser knows it before he makes his contract. The purchaser dies, and the widow is the
sole beneficiary. The pension is then valued for
succession duty purposes and is part of the estate
that he bas left. . . . It is, I submit, an anomaly
that the value of the pension is fixed for succession duty without any abatement of income tax.

I quite agree with that statement.
Hon. Mr. Croll: But she does not agree with
it now.
Hon. Mr. Bruni: We do not know.
Hon. Mr. Croll: She voted in favour of the
bill.
Hon. Mr. Leonard: I am not sure that she
has had a chance to consider this amendment.
The honourable senator from Winnipeg
South referred to the draftsmanship of the
particular amendment. I hold no brief for the
draftsmanship. It was submitted to our Law
Clerk. If the amendment is accepted in principle I shall be quite happy to have any
proper wording that carries out that principle
and is acceptable to our Law Clerk used in
the amendment. So far as I can see, the
words suggested by the honourable senator
would merely make the intention clearer.
Once the provision that income tax is not
to be taken into consideration is struck out,
then surely in valuation one must fall back
on the value of the pension benefit; and if
the pension benefit has a built-in tax liability

AUGUST 28, 1958
it is obviously not as valuable as a pension
benefit of the same amount that has no
built-in tax liability.
I realize there are practical difficulties with
respect to valuation of pension benefits, but
there are practical difficulties with respect to
valuation of a great many assets. Take the
particular case which has been quoted here
today. There would be no difficulty in valuing
that particular pension benefit if this amendment were accepted. And in other cases I
have seen I think it is quite practical to set
a fair market value.
Perhaps it is not for me to comment on
what might happen to this bill when it leaves
this place. I have known the Minister of
Finance personally for a good many years
and I have a high regard for him. I would
hope he would accept all the amendments we
made in the spirit in which they have been
put forward, as a constructive work on the
part of this house and designed to improve
what we think is good legislation.
Hon. Muriel McQ. Fergusson: Mr. Chairman, my first remark on this section is
in reply to the statement made by the honourable senator from Winnipeg South (Hon.
Mr. Thorvaldson) when he stated that the
amendment would involve considerable discrimination. Well, I consider that there is
some discrimination in this bill anyway and
I would refer honourable senators to section
7, which provides that there is to be a
deduction of $60,000 for a widow when her
husband dies, but if the wife dies first her
husband can only claim the same deduction
if he is infirm and has a child under 21 years
of age who is wholly dependent on him.
If that is not rank discrimination against
men, I don't know what it is. We women are
interested in the family, and we feel it is
just as important for the husband to have
money to bring up the family when his wife
has died as it is for the wife to have money
to bring up the family when her husband
has died. When the husband is left he has
to hire help and is put to great expense.
I leave that with you as an example of
discrimination in this bill, and one which the
women of Canada do not appreciate. Women
ask for equality; they ask to be treated as
equals with men; they do not ask for preferential or generous treatment, but just that
they be treated fairly. This item certainly
shows discrimination.
I would like to be able to express as clearly
as did the honourable senator from TorontoRosedale (Hon. Mr. Leonard) some of the
points which he raised. I certainly consider
that unless this amendment is accepted great
hardship will be caused to many people.
Many a woman who becomes a widow is
entitled to part of a benefit or pension that

her husband was receiving. This of course
must be capitalized, and the widow must
pay the sucession duty or the estates tax on
that amount within four years. True, the
bill does extend the period of payment to
six years. But I emphasize that even to be
required to pay the tax off in six years may
put a heavy strain on what slender resources
the widow may have.
Many dozens of cases have come to my attention where widows in these circumstances
have suffered great hardship. I am sure if
honourable senators knew the details of them
they could better appreciate the fact that
despite the need of the Government to raise
revenue, which we all realize it has to do,
it must not raise it at the cost of great sacrifice to widowed mothers. I would remind
honourable gentlemen that we believe the
state was made for man and not man for
the state, and although we require this money
to carry on the state I don't think we should
at the same time ignore the individual.
Perhaps I am getting away from my point,
which was to emphasize the fact that it is
hard enough for the widow to pay the estate
tax on the capitalized annuity or pension
which she is going to get, but it is adding
insult to injury to require her to pay income
tax on money which she has never received.
We feel that should not be done.
Honourable senators, I am very pleased to
support the amendment to section 26 which
was moved in the Banking and Commerce
Committee by the honourable senator from
Toronto-Rosedale.
Hon. Salier A. Hayden: Honourable senators, I think the amendment to section 26
which has been proposed and reported by the
committee, is fair and is intelligible, and that
there is great public demand for it. It is fair
because it extends some consideration in the
field of estate tax to a large section of the
public who may be dependent on the proceeds
of a pension benefit or a superannuation
benefit after the death of the breadwinner in
the family.
This amendment was not something that
was concocted by the members of the committee who supported it solely for the purpose, or indeed at all for the purpose, of
being cantankerous or for making a change
in a bill that came before the committee.
There was, and there is, a large body of
public opinion, as was evidenced by representations made before the committee, which
favours this kind of legislation.
The amendment, in essence, is very simple.
For instance, where a pension benefit accrues
to a widow on the death of her husband the
capitalized value of that pension is determined
for the purpose of compiling the estate of the

SENATE
deceased husband. When a pension is capitalized on the basis of, say, an annual payment
of $2,000 a year, and the widow has a life
expectancy of 20 or 25 years, reference is
made to the mortality tables and a calculation
is made of the capitalized value of the pension
at $2,000 a year for the 20 or the 25 years.
The objections made in the representations
which were given effect to in part by this
amendment, were these: that there is inherent in the annual pension payment going
to the widow, in the sum that has been built
up by the contributions of the husband without tax, and in the contributions of the employer without tax on the husband's lifetime,
a deferred tax liability; and the pension that
goes to the widow after the husband dies has
taken from it each year some element of incorne tax to satisfy the deferment that was
granted with respect to payment of income
tax during the lifetime of the husband when
the ffund was being built up, so that it would
be there ready to provide payments after
he died.
The view of the committee was that such
a set-up is not fair, that it does not represent
fair market value of that pension at the date
of the husband's death. If you capitalize the
pension without reflecting the liability for
income tax that is inherent in it, as the
moneys are paid out, it is essentially unfair.
By doing so you capitalize something which
the widow receives only as a conduit pipe,
because the amount she receives has this tax
element in it. She receives the money and
pays it out; or, depending on the source, the
payments may be withheld or deducted by
the payer corporation and never be received
by her. Yet, under the present Succession
Duty Act and the bill as drawn, in capitalizing the value of that pension you include all
those elements. In all fairness, if you were
attempting to arrive at the present value of,
for instance, a debt which was owing to you
five years hence-let us say the debt was
$10,000-would you by any stretch of the
imagination say that the value of that debt
today, payable in five years, would be the
full principal surn of $10,000? Indeed, if you
were attempting to arrive at the fair market
value of that debt you would translate it into
present-day terms, and decide what is the
value of what you are going to get in five
years.
Those were the thoughts that agitated the
minds of most of the members of the committec. I would say, if there was one point
upon which the members appeared to have
more unanimity than on any other point it
was this question. The discussion indicated
that they felt this was a situation which required some attention to see if there was any

other way of dealing with it. We have dealt
with it as set out in the proposed amendment.
My friend the senator from Winnipeg South
(Hon. Mr. Thorvaldson) tells us many things
about the amendment, one of which is that
it is meaningless unless we add more words
to it. Well, if he considers it is meaningless,
and if his opinion is held by the Government,
why are we wasting time discussing it in
this committee? If it is meaningless it cannot affect the bill, so why waste time? Let
us get on to some other piece of legislation.
But my friend says it is meaningless unless
after the words "no allowance or deduction
shall be made for or on account of income
tax, except where a superannuation or pension benefit is taxable under the Income Tax
Act" there are added the words "in the case
of which an allowance shall be made in
respect of income tax payable thereon". My
friend is being almost wasteful in his use of
words, and I am astonished to find that
characteristic in a lawyer as well known
as he is.
Hon. Mr. Thorvaldson: Well, I am just from
Winnipeg!
Hon. Mr. Hayden: I suggest that this kind
of sentence makes about as much sense as his
objection to the amendment on the ground
that it is meaningless. For instance, one might
as well say, "No one shall enter this Senate
chamber except a senator, in which case he
may enter the Senate chamber."
Hon. Mr. Thorvaldson:
different.

That is entirely

Hon. Mr. Hayden: Are these additional
words necessary in order to get the intent
and the meaning? It is obvious to me that
even my friend appreciated the meaning, because he addressed himself to the problem
a little earlier and said that if we adopted
this amendment we would be discriminating
in favour of these people as against an infinite
variety of other cases where we were not
giving relief. How could the amendment be
discriminatory if the words themselves are
meaningless?
So, I say, the words have a meaning, and
a clear meaning. All we are trying to do
is to get the present fair market value of
a pension which a widow may receive on the
death of her husband, and have it valued
according to the true elements of market
value, not with elements which add nothing
to her benefit; and in that instance I say
that there is the element of income tax
which provides no benefit for her and which
must be paid. There is nothing in this
bill which provides for any abatement of the
income tax payable, and we say that, since
it must be paid, it is not a proper element

AUGUST 28, 1958
to be considered in arriving at the capital
value of the pension at the date of the
husband's death.
My friend said something else which, I
rnust say, I found rather irritating. I have
been in this house a littie longer than he
has.
Hon. Mr. Thorvaldson: I admitted that, did
I flot?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: I have been here over
18 years; and in ail that tirne I have neyer
taken the position in relation to any legislation that rny consideration of it rnust be
weighed in the balance of whether or flot
the Governrnent would accept rny thinking.
I thought rny duty was to look at a bill, and
look at it quite irnpersonally, in the interest
of the people of Canada, whorn we represent,
and then decide whether it is constitutional or
unconstitutional, whether it is in the interest
of our people or of a large section of thern,
whether it does violence to rninority rîghts in
various parts of the country, and that having
satisfied rnyself on these points I should
decide whether it was a good and beneficial
piece of legislation. I amrn ot for have
1 ever been prepared to accept the assumption
that, in considering whether 1 should vote
for or against any bll, I should weigh in
the balance the view of the Government
as to whether or not rny conclusion would
be acceptable to it. In respect of the present
amendment I have had no such indication,
because the amendment i this form has not
corne before the Governrnent. But if I were
to rely on precedent I rnight point out that
recently the Senate arnended a section of a
bill which had been reported back f0 it,
and at that time it was said, "Oh, the rnister
wiil not accept that arnendrnent." That was
why today there was a slight ripple of applause
when the bull carne back from the House
of Cornmons and it was announced by the
honourable the Acting Speaker that that
House had accepted the arnendrnent. So I
cannot presume that this bill is not; acceptable
to the Govemnment; and although my honourable friend the senator frorn Winnipeg South
is the sponsor of the bill in this charnber
I question his rîght to make the staternent,
as well as the propriety of making it, that
the bill with this arnendrnent to section 26
is not acceptable to the Goverrnent. There
is an orderly process by which we can find
that out. In the meantirne let us deal with
the bill on its rnerits. Either it is rneritorious
or it is not. If if is not, let us vote against
if, but let us not vote against if because
of a conjecture that if it is returned to the
other place with this arnendment the Cornmons wîll reject it.
The honourable senator who has just
spoken, as well as previous speakers, have

stated that it is a good bill, and if it is
desired to add volurne to their pronouncement I will agree that if is a good bill, that
is, good by reference to the existing law. My
early training in grarnrar taught me thaf
there are different degrees of progress-good,
better, best. It is too rnuch to expect f0
reach in legisiation the stage of "lbest", but
I arn always hoping that we can progress
frorn good to better. I believe that this arnendrnent will produce a better bill than the billwhich is a good bill-wthout if. If the bill is
as good as it is represented to be, I arn not
concerned whether this amendrnent will mean
the difference between the enactment or nonenactmenf of the bill into law this year,
especially in the light of ail the publicify
which has been given to the great advantages
and benefits which. people will gain under the
proposed legislation.
Wîth regard fo the question of the Senafe's
powers, I thought the hast remant of that
argument was hopehessly sunk last night,
when Dr. Eaton admitted that so far as ways
and rneans are concerned in the present fiscal
year of the Governrnent the revenues frorn
this rneasure were not considered at ah. He
made that very fiat statement last evening,
toward the conclusion of our hearing. In due
course honourable senators wîll be able to
read it in the report of the cornmittee's
proceedings and observe how close I arn to
an accurate quotation of his words. Now, if
we are not disturbing in any wise the balance
of ways and means as regards the fiscal
policy of the Governrnent and the administration, if the Governrnent, in laying out its
finances for the year, whether budgeting for
a deficit or a surplus, has not given any consideration to what this measure miight produce
if it were in force during the period, what
force is there to the question of our constitutional powers? Dr. Eaton explained that it
would not affect presenit revenues because,
obviously, it takes sorne time to educaf e the
public. People will have to be told of the
material changes, and they may have to
review and in many cases rewrite their wills
to take care of the incidence of tax liability.
Some time is likehy to elapse, even after the
bill is proclaimed, before it cornes into force.
And so, since taxes wihl not be payable for
six rnonths after death, the trne will run
to the end of the Governrnent's present fiscal
year. This is a further reason for saying that
anything which might result frorn this arnendment, by way of more revenue, or less, cannot be a factor in the balance of ways and
means of the present fiscal year of the Governrnent.
I flnd it difficuit to accept the proposition
of my honourable friend that when the
Senate reduces taxes it has the effect of

SENATE
increasing taxes somewhere else. There is no
question as to the power of the Senate to
reduce taxes. If my honourable friend wants
more supporting material, he heard me refer
to the opinion of the Chairman of a Senate
Committee which made a report on this very
question in May 1918. The substance of that
report still stands. It reaffirms what is provided in our Constitution, that while the
House of Commons is the only authority
which can impose taxation-and therefore
which can increase taxation-there is no
law to prevent the Senate from reducing
taxes. As a matter of fact, we are delinquent
in our duty if we do not do so in a proper
case. When we pass an amendment which
may put a fair-market value on an asset,
such as a pension or superannuation benefit,
thereby having the ultimate effect of reducing the amount of tax that may come from
an estate, as far as I am concerned it does
not in any sense increase taxation. On the
other hand, if it has the effect of decreasing
taxation, then it is well within the power
of the Senate to pass such an amendment.
This is a good amendment to a good bill
and it should provide no embarrassment. As
a matter of fact, the Government should
receive additional accolades because of the
Senate's function and action in listening to
the representations of so many people across
Canada who asked to be heard and in providing this much needed relief.
Hon. W. M. Aseltine: Honourable senators, I am always delighted with the eloquence of my honourable friend from Toronto
(Hon. Mr. Hayden), even though I cannot
always agree with his argument. He is
frequently correct but I cannot follow his
argument on this occasion.
In reply to the honourable gentleman from
Toronto-Rosedale (Hon. Mr. Leonard), let me
say that we should not try to draft taxing
statutes on the basis of one or two unusual
examples. That was the sort of approach
made to this bill throughout the meetings
of the Banking and Commerce Committee.
Some exceptional case would be cited that
would have this, that or the other effect.
I am absolutely unable to approve this
amendment to section 26, for the reasons
which were so eloquently given by the minister himself when he appeared before our
committee, and by the three or four officials
of the Department of National Revenue and
the Department of Finance. I hope the house
will agree that we should not jeopardize passage of this legislation by trying to insert
an amendment of this kind which would
be discriminatory in so far as other sources
of income are concerned. In the first place,
it was explained that this scheme is un-workable and that no method had been found

whereby the tax could be ascertained. A
second objection was that it is discriminatory, a fact that has been satisfactorily
proven by the honourable senator from
Winnipeg South (Hon. Mr. Thorvaldson). The
third objection was that it would interfere
with the balance of ways and means. Now,
it might not do that during the next two or
three months but, if this bill is passed, it
will have a bearing on the balance of ways
and means for some time unless something
happens in the future. Like the honourable
gentleman from Winnipeg South, I would
call attention to the excellent address made
in this house in 1956 by the present Leader
of the Opposition in the Senate (Hon. Mr.
Macdonald), who at that time was Leader
of the Government here. After referring to
the same opinion that the honourable gentleman from Toronto (Hon. Mr. Hayden) referred to a moment ago, the honourable
leader of that day said:
In my opinion it would be most unwise, although
within its legal competence, for the Senate to
substitute its judgment in this matter at this time.
I believe that so far as possible "the balance of
ways and means" should be preserved, and that
the Senate should not lightly or without the most
mature reflection upset the calculations of those
charged with making those calculations and with
the preparation and initiation of the measures
designed to bring them into effect.

And referring to the
discussion he said:

clause then under

I do not believe that the clause concerned is of
such a nature or order that the Senate should
intervene at this time. For these reasons, I must
oppose the amendment suggested by the Standing
Committee on Banking and Commerce.

Hon. Mr. Power: May I ask the honourable
Leader of the Government (Hon. Mr. Aseltine) a question, as a matter of curiosity? I
do not remember clearly, but I am under the
impression that perhaps he himself voted
against that opinion of the then Leader of
the Government (Hon. Mr. Macdonald).
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: That is my recollection too.
Hon. Mr. Power: It seems to me that what
the honourable leader has just read was a
consequence of an amendment which I had
introduced contrary to the wishes of the
Government of the day. A vote was taken
in this house on a motion to refer the matter
back to committee, and I think 16 or 17 honourable senators voted to the effect that the
bill be not referred back to committee but
that it be carried with the amendment. As I
say, I am under the impression that the
present honourable Leader of the Government voted in the same way that I did.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: There is no record of it
here, and I am quite sure I did not do that.

AUGUST 28,1958
Hon. Mr. Power: I arn just asking.
Han. Mr. Aselline: At any rate, I have just
given the house the opinion expressed on
that former occasion by the present Leader
of the Opposition (Hon. Mr. Macdonald).
Getting back to the bill, the rnembers of the
committeee made certain suggestions to the
minister, as a resuit of which. the departmental officiais drafted aIl these amendments
except the one now in question. There were
seven such amendments. This one that we are
cansidering now was not acceptable.
Hon. Mr,. Hayden: There were only five
amendments unless you include saime minor
ones for the insertion or deletion of punctuation and the word "and".
Hon. Mr. Power: And acceptance of those
was an important concession!
Han. Mr. Aseltine: Every speaker this afternoon bas saîd this is a good bill. I agree.
I know it is a good bill. The honourable
senator from Fredericton (Hon. Mrs. Fergusson) overlooked the fact that in 99 cases out of
100 there would not be any tax at ail in a
case of the kind she suggested, because there
is a $60,000 exemption. Unless the people
in New Brunswick are far more wealthy
than those in Saskatchewan this would not
have much effect.
Now, I have received ail manner of communications from people ail over the country, and they want this bill passed. Wben 1
go back ta Saskatchewan I do not want to
have to tell the people there that this bill has
not been passed and that this exemption of
$60,000, and $10,000 for each child, will not
be the law in the case of the death of a
testator or a person who has not made any
will at ail. They expect this bill, which is
relieving legisiation, to be passed.
Honourable senatars, I say in ail sincerity
that 1 hope that this honourable body will
not insist upon the amendment and thus
baid up passage of the bill for an indefinite
period.
Hon. W. Ross Macdonald: Honourable senators, in view of the fact that a speech wbieb
I made a few years ago bas been mentioned
two or tbree times during this debate, I feel
that I sbould rise and say a few words at
this tîme. Needless to say, I arn very fiattered to think that a speech I made more
than two years ago is stili remembered. In
future I shail try to make speeches equally
as good.
I arn also very pleased to know that apparently the Leader of the Government (Hon.
Mr. Aseltine) bas been converted ta my way
of tbinking witb regard to maney bis. Like
the honourable senator fram Gulf (Hon. Mr.
Power), I must say that in 1956 the Leader of
57075-4-45

the Government was not in accord with my
views. It has taken two years ta change
his opinion, but two years is nat a very long
period in one's lifetime.
Honaurable senators, 1 was one of those
who opposed quite strenuously in committee
the amendment ta section 26 of the bihl-at
least, if not strenuausly, it took me a long
time ta do the opposing; and altbough, shali
I say, the wind was taken completely out of
my sails by the remark made by Dr. Eaton
with respect to the revenues which it was
expected would be received under this bill,
nevertbeless I stiil feel that I cannot support
the amendment at this time, because in my
opinion the money to be raised by the Government is a matter peculiarly and strictly
in the hands of the Governmnent. The Governrnent has drawn up a financial scherne for
carrying on the business of the country, and
the revenue to be received frorn this bill is
included in the rnoney which is to be required
by the Governrnent. However, having said
that, I can say that that is the only reason
why 1 cannot support the amendment.
1 tbink the amendment has considerable
menit. I cannot say that I agree with the
honourable senator from Winnipeg South
(Hon. Mr. Thorvaldson) when hie says that
the amendment will nat be accepted by the
Government. As the senator frorn Toronto
(Hon. Mr. Hayden) pointed out, I do not
tbink that anyone in this bouse can say now
that the amendment will not be accepted by
the Government. I agree with everytbing hie
said in that cannection. It is for us to propose aur amendments, and I tbink we have
every right to propose an amendrnent. To
say now, before the minister bas read the
debate wbich is taking place in tbis bouse,
that tbe Government will not accept the
arnendment is, I tbhnk, going altogether too
far. Indeed, the Minister of Finance migbt
be influenced by this debate, just as tbe
Leader of the Government (Hon. Mr. Aseltine)
was apparently infiuenced by the speech I
made the other day in the committee on ways
and means.
It is true that in the first instance I oppased
this ameadment. I did so, for one reason,
because 1 thought it would disturb the balance of ways and means. I also opposed it
because I thaught it was the responsibility,
as I still feel it is, of tbe Government to propose the measures for raising the finances of
this cauntry. That is their business.
Now, I think most of us admit that this
bil will not affect the finances of tbe country
tbis year. It will in years ta came. This bill
wihl not affect the balance of ways and means.
My friend tbe Leader of the Governrnent said
in effect that the bill will affect the balance
of ways and means in years ta corne. Well,

706

a.1

the set-up of the finances of the country is
on an annual basis, and the balance of ways
and means can be aff ected only in respect to
money that is received in any one fiscal year.
In view of the statement of Dr. Eaton in
comrnittee last evening to the effect that tbe
Government did not expect this year to
receive any revenue frorn this bill, this bill
cannot in any way be considered as affecting
the balance of ways and means.
I know honourable senators will think tbat
I arn talking around the bill, and I ratber feel
tbat I arn. The only reason I arn not supporting the amendrnent, as I have said, is
that the Governrnent bas tbe sole responsibility of bringing forward financial legislation of this type.
Honourable senators, it has been said that
this legisiation is unfair to a certain class
of people. From the speeches that bave been
made here today, and from the instances that
have been given, it does appear to be inequitable, in that those who pay the income
tax throughout their lifetime do not pay
estate tax on the amount of the income tax
they have paid when the annuity cornes into
the estate, whereas one who has not paid
the income tax pays the estate tax on the
capitalized value of the annuity plus the
unpaid income tax which is not considered
te be a debt. 1 can follow the argument of
the honourable senator from Toronto (Hon.
Mr. Hayden) when be says that is a debt
which should be excluded fromn the estate
in arriving at the amount of the tax, and I
would go along with that if it were not for
the way I feel witb regard to the position
which we must take in connection with a
financial bill.
It bas been said here today, and empbasized,
that if this amendrnent is carried it will
jeopardize passage of this bill. I do not want
to misquote the honourable senator frorn
Winnipeg South, but I understood birn to
intimate that if this ameadment were carried
the bill xvnuld be defeated.
Hon. Mr. Thorvaldson: I was not speaking
for anybody else. I gave that as my own
view, and I arn entitled to do that.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I understood my lionourable friend said this amendment was not
acceptable to the Government, and in reply
I say I do not know how hie could possibly
make that statement. In any event, hie did
intimate that if tbe amendment is not acceptable to the Government the bill would of
necessîty be defeated.
Hon. Mr. Thorvaldson: I believe the minister stated to the comrnittee some tirne ago
that the arnendrnent to the section was
wholly unacceptable to the Government.

A Ký

Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I think we ail want
to be fair about this because, as the honourable senator frorn Winnipeg South has stated,
this is flot a party matter. We should flot
have party issues in this house. In this debate
honourable senators from both sides of the
house have taken a prominent part in
defending this amendment.
Hon. Mr. Bruni: And we have the honourable Leader of the Opposition expressing
opposition to the arnendment, as further evidence of non-partisanship.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: There are no partisan
issues bere. Perhaps we can say that this
is a bipartisan debate.
Now, bonourable senators, if this arnendThe
ment does carry, what will happen?
bill as amended will go to the House of
Commons. That bouse will then consider it,
havingc read what bas taken place here this
afternoon. The otber house rnay approve
of tbe amendrnent; if it does that is the
end of it. But if after debating the amendment the other bouse disapproves of it, the
bill will then be returned to the Senate
and we will read wbat took place ovcr there
and, after further consideration, we rnay stili
feel that the amendment should go through,
or we rnay decide tbat perbaps we sbould
not press it.
I do flot think we can corne to a conclusion on that question at the present tirne.
The amendment is before the Senate. I
bave listened to the debate so far in the
Senate, I followed closely the discussion in
the standing comrnittee, and I arn going to
vote in accordance with the views which I
expressed at the commencement of my
remarks this afternoon.
The Chairman: Is the cornmittee ready for
tbe question?
Hon. Senators: Question.
Tbe question of concurrence in the arnendment being put, the committee divided as
follows: Yeas, 29; nays, 11.
On the committee's fiftb amendrnent.
Page 28, Uines 1 and 2: Strike out lines 1 and 2
and substitute therefor:
"The value of the debt shahI, unless it is established that at the timne of the creation of the debt
the deceased and such debtor were personS dealing

for the purposes of this Part as though the amnount
thereof outstanding"

Amendrnent agreed to.
On tbe cornrittee's sixtb arnendrnent:

person is the successor includes any estate or Interest in land situated in Canada, be and continue
to be for as long as that amount or any part
thereof remains unpaid a lien upon such estate or
interest; and"
Amendment agreed to.
On the committee's seventh amendment:
Page 35: Immediately after subclause (1) of
clause 43, add the following as subclause (2):
"(2) Notwithstanding subsection (1), the consent
of the Minister under section 47 to the transfer
of any land or any estate or interest therein upon
which a lien under subsection (1) exists shall be
deemed to discharge such lien, and the Minister
shall, upon application therefor made to him in any
case where subsequent to the registration of any
caution of lien as provided in subsection (1), any
such lien is discharged, whether by payment in
full of the amount thereof or in any other manner,
issue to the person by whom the application is
made a certificate of such discharge."
Amendment agreed to.

On the committee's eighth amendment:
Page 36, line 22: Strike out line 22 and substitute
therefor: "to be made one or more copies thereof
and shall, upon request by the person from whom
the original document was seized or by whom it
was produced, in any case where a copy thereof
has been made pursuant to this section, send, a
copy thereof to such person or, if no copy thereof
has been made pursuant to this section, allow such
person at any reasonable time to have access to
the document so seized or produced, and a
document"
Amendment agreed to.

would have affected many more people and
been more appropriate than the amendments
that have been made.
I refer to one clause in the bill which provides that where an annuity is capitalized the

tax will be assessed on that capitalized value
and will be payable forthwith by the estate.

Provision is made that in cases where there
is hardship the minister may extend the payments over a period of six years. How great
the hardship must be before the period is
extended, I do not know. But I do know that
if a deceased man leaves his widow an an-

nuity which does not come into the hands of
the estate-say it is an annual payment to
the widow by an insurance company-the
annuity is capitalized, and the tax is fixed on
that capitalized value. If the deceased also
left other property, including, we will say, a
home or a farm, and the tax on the annuity
is, say, $3,000, in those circumstances the
Government is forced, under the provisions of
this bill, to take $3,000 from the widow and
apply it on the tax. Now, honourable senators, if we were going to do anything by way

of amending this bill, I think that is one of
the amendments we should make.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: Next year.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I still stand by my
view and by the speeches I have already made

on this subject.
I should like also to refer to the brief that
was presented to the committee by the CanaThe Hon. the Acting Speaker: Honourable dian Federation of University Women. In
senators, the Chairman of the Committee of this respect, honourable senators may recall

Hon. Mr. Macdonald: It may be an exceptional case, but I think the amendment which

we just passed also applies to exceptional
cases. The principle, I say, is wrong, whether
it has to do with an exceptional case or not.
It may create great hardship and unfairness,
even in exceptional cases.

SENATE

The point is, honourable senators, a man
who dies today, ieaving an estate of $60,000,
on which there is no tax, does flot have to
leave that money to his widow. The honourabie Leader of the Government (Hon. Mr.
Aseltine) may say, "Oh, but the law of
Saskatchewan requires hlm to leave it to the
widow." Let me say the iaw of Ontario does
flot require him to leave it to his widow;
and if the widow has sufficient moneys of bier
own she cannot go to the court and ask for
any consideration. In this bill I think we
are getting away from the home and the
family. Therefore I say if any amendment
was to be made affecting the revenue which
would come to the Government through this
bill, it would have been more fair to amend
some of the provisions to which I have
referred.
1 referred tri the brief that was presented by
the Canadian Federation of University Women
before the committee. Honourabie senators
will recali what a splendid brief it was, and
how well it was presented by the representative of the federation. I thought a very fair
case was made out. Let me read a few words
from thc brief.
We are distressed to note
submnissions by thousands
recognition has yet been
partnerslîip. We reiterate

that in spite of repeated
of Canadian womnen, no
made of the mnarriage
that-

This is what the federation wants:
One hall of a deceased marriage partrier's estate
should, if it passes to the surviving partner. be
considered for tax purposes as earned by the
surviving partrier. and not therefore subject to
estate taxation.

Honourable senators wlll note that this
brief is in agreement with what I have been
trying to say, that one-balf of the money that
passes to the surviving partner-not to some
relative or friend-sbould be free from taxation. The university women do flot say that
a man has to leave half of bis estate to bis
widow, but thcy do ask the Government,
in cases where balf of the estate goes to the
widow, that it sbould be free from estate tax.
Honourable senators, if we are going to tell
the Government of Canada how it is to raise
its taxes, and where relief sbould be given
from taxation-and I feel we should be free
to tell tbe Government-tbefl I tbink it would
have been more appropriate bad this bouse
proposed amendments in accordance with the
suggestions I have made, than in the manner
in wblch amendments have been made.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: Honourable senators,
may I make a comment with respect to one
point raised by the honourable Leader of the
Opposition? In the province of Saskatchewan
we do not make wllls in the manner in which
he suggests. In the 40 years during which 1
bave been drawing wills-and when I am

home I draw an average of four or five wills
a week-the wife and chlldren have neyer
been left out. I cannot remember a single
case in ail those years wbere that happened;
I should think it would be a most unusual
circumstance if it did bappen.
Hon. Paul H. Bouffard: Honourable senators I do not intend to speak very long on
this bill. Like the Leader of the Opposition
(Hon. Mr. Macdonald), I am of the opinion
that the amendments which tbe Banking and
Commerce Committee agreed to were far
from, being the most important ones proposed
in the committee. Several amendments wbicb
were made in committee could be presented
bere, and if I do not propose any of tbemn on
third reading it is for the sole reason that
the committee intimated that it could not
support tbem. One such amendment which
I proposed was for recognition of the family
tie between a deceased and bis wife and chuldren. It is true, as some honourable senators
have said, that in most cases the content of
the will favours the wife and children. I hope
that Canadians wili continue to follow that
course. But to my mind this tie is not recognized in the bill. It should not be permissible
for a man to give what hie bas to, outsiders
and obtain the benefit of exemptions in respect of property which should be passed to
his wife and cbildren.
The second amendment which I proposed
in committee, as recognizing the family tie
between a deceased, bis wif e and cbildren,
was that the tax sbould be cut in baîf up to
$200,000 of taxable value when the wif e and
children are the heneficiaries. This motion
was not accepted, and for that reason I shall
not propose it on third reading. But I stili
contend that it is the kind 0f amendment
which should have been accepted, in recognition of the family tie, and I bave not in mind
particularly action in committee; the idea
sbould be acceptable to the Government.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: The law would in no
way be complicated by the acceptance of the
amendment. Ail that officiais would have to
consider was whetber the woman and the
cbildren referred to in the will were in fact
tbe man's wife and cbildren: if so, notbing
more would be involved than cutting the tax
in haîf. The Minister stated before the Banking and Commerce Committee of the other
place that to accept a suggestion of this kind
would be an encroachment upon provincial
jurisdiction. I cannot agree. As a matter of
fact, honourabie senators, everyone knows that
in respect of income tax the Government
allows an exemption of $2,500 in case of
marriage. If the Government bas the power
to tax the family it bas also the power to

AUGUST 28. 1958
reduce a tax. The tax imposed by the federal
Government in this connection is harmful to
the family tie, and we think that in these
circumstances the only Government which
can give them proper recognition, by cutting
the tax in two, is the Government which
imposes it. This is not a matter of provincial
jurisdiction.
I repeat that I do not propose the amendment here, because it was unacceptable to the
committee, and I do not want to waste the
time of the house by proposing amendments
which have not been accepted elsewhere. I
still feel that the bill, although it is a good
one, because it does reduce taxation to a certain extent, is far from being perfect. As
I have said, it overlooks completely the
claims of the family tie, to which we in
Canada should give full recognition, in themselves, and for what they mean to our
country.
Hon. Charles B. Howard: Honourable senators, I took objection to this bill when it was
introduced here, but because I felt it was in
the interest of the taxpayers to get it before
committee as soon as possible I did not then
make the speech that I had intended to make.
At the beginning of my remarks let me
state that I agree one hundred per cent with
what has just been said by the honourable
senator from Grandville (Hon. Mr. Bouffard)
as far as the family is concerned. I cannot
consent to the proposition that money in an
estate which is left to strangers should be
in the same category as that which goes
along the family line.
I have two reasons for suggesting that this
bill be deferred. The Government has
already announced, as everyone knows, that
the Succession Duty Act will remain in force
until the end of the present fiscal year, so
the families of those who die in the meantime would not be prejudiced, and there
would be opportunity not only to approve
the amendments which the committee has
agreed upon but to pass others which I believe
would be valuable.
Let me mention some things I have in
mind. It is true that the new legislation,
as well as the present act, provides for the
taxing of property wherever in the world it
happens to be. On the other hand, let us
take an example of what is being done. Suppose a person has a property of the value of

$100,000 in the United States and another

of equal value in Canada. Under this proposed
law the value of the American property is
added to that of the Canadian property and
the rate is boosted into a much higher
category. Then they go to the people of Canada and say, "That doesn't make much difference because they give you credit for the tax
paid in the country where the other property

exists." Just stop and think about this for a
minute. Take the states of New York and
New Jersey. The first thing the taxing authorities do there with respect to estate tax is to
divide the estate in two and tax only one-half
of it. Therefore the tax is based on $50,000
and at a very much lower rate than is the
tax on Canadian estates. By adding $100,000
to $100,000 in Canada you get $200,000, on
which I think the tax is $25,000 more. Instead
of giving you credit for the tax on the total
property, they give you credit for the tax
paid in the United States. I claim that the
tax credit in the other country should be at
exactly the same rate as the tax charged on
the property in Canada.
Hon. Mr. Bruni: What if it is a higher
rate?
Hon. Mr. Howard: Don't forget that when
this legislation becomes law, say in a year
from now, other states will probably copy
some of this legislation. As everyone knows,
both in the United States and in England
they have used the term "estate tax" instead
o' "succession duties". But what I had hoped
for was the introduction in Canada of an
Estate Tax Act which would be a considerable improvement over the Succession Duty
Act. Let me say something else, and this
is from a non-political viewpoint. At the
present time nearly every province in Canada
has an administration of the very same political stripe as that of the federal Parliament
at Ottawa. A previous Government could not
make any deal with the Governments of
Ontario and Quebec, which are now on the
same status as the federal Government. I
claim that now is the time to get these provinces into the dealHon. Mr. Aselline: Who told you that?
Hon. Mr. Howard: -and get an estate tax
law that will be uniform all over Canada.
This can be done.
Hon. Mr. Bruni: Would the honourable
gentleman permit me to ask him if he considers that the Union Nationale Government
is a Conservative Government?
Hon. Mr. Howard: I was not going to make
it quite as political as that, but if I were
to tell you who elected the Quebec members
to the federal Parliament at the last electionHon. Mr. Thorvaldson: Who did?
Hon. Mr. Howard: -it was the Union Nationale party.
Hon. Mr. Thorvaldson: It was the people.
Hon. Mr. Howard: At any rate, that is not
the point. Now is the time to bring into
existence an act which would be satisfactory
to all. I can go further than that. As I

SENATE
said once before, the taxpayers of this country
are the customers of the state and we should
not treat our customers as provided in this
bill, especially when they are good customers.
Nobody wants to pay more taxes than he
has to but the Succession Duty Act came into
force years ago to provide necessary revenues
for the Government. But it seems to me
there are plenty of ways to raise money other
than by the imposition of an extraordinary
estate tax. If it is argued that this money
is required through the instrument of an
Estate Tax Act, then, to my way of looking
at it, it is practically a capital levy and
nothing else, and I believe capital levies
should be imposed upon people while they
are alive rather than when they are dead,
as this legislation does. While I admit some
sections of this bill are an improvement on
parts of the Succession Duty Act, it is not
nearly as good as I think it could have been
if more time had been taken to go into the
matter carefully instead of having it introduced in the very last days of the session.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Howard: I do not want to delay
honourable members any longer. I had not
intended to address the house on this occasion and so I did not prepare a speech. However, I have expressed my views and I come
back to the same point. Rather than have
certain exemptions in certain cases, I would
prefer that in the case of a family there be
a flat exemption of $200,000, letting the estate
tax be paid on only one-half, and that no
estate tax should be payable on any estate

under $100,000.

Hon. Muriel McQ. Fergusson: Honourable
senators, unlike the honourable gentleman
who has just spoken (Hon. Mr. Howard), I
have prepared a speech. I want to put my
views on the record but I am afraid it will
take some little time to do so. As the hour
is late I would be glad to adjourn the debate
now, if that is the wish of the house.
Hon. Mr. Bruni: Could the honourable
senator conclude her remarks by 6 o'clock?
Hon. Mrs. Fergusson: I am not sure.
Hon. Mr. Bruni: How about trying?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I am sure we would
like to hear the honourable senator now.
Hon. Mr. Bruni: Yes; we could sit a few
minutes after 6 o'clock.
Hon. Mrs. Fergusson: Thank you. This is
the first occasion on which I have addressed
the house in formal session this year. I report this with some regret and with the hope
that I shall be able to take a more active
part in our future discussions. I regret that
His Honour the Speaker is absent, for even

at this rather late date I wish to extend
to him my felicitations and to tell him how
much I admire the fair, dignified and distinguished manner in which he has been
carrying out his duties both inside and outside this chamber.
I would also like to congratulate the
honourable senator from Ottawa East (Hon.
Mr. Choquette) upon the able manner in
which he is carrying out his responsible
duties as Acting Speaker.
I would like to say publicly, as I have
said privately, how happy I was at the appointment of my good friend the honourable
senator from Rosetown (Hon. Mr. Aseltine)
as Leader of the OppositionHon. Mr. Howard: You are referring to the
future.
Hon. Mrs. Fergusson: -as Leader of the
Government. I am sorry, however, that his
appointment had to come about through the
retirement of the honourable gentleman from
Winnipeg (Hon. Mr. Haig), for whom we
all have a great deal of affection and
admiration.
To the new senators who have joined us
this session may I say we have already
welcomed you warmly, we enjoy having you
with us and we hope you will continue for
many years as our colleagues.
Honourable senators, it was a great disappointment to me not to be in this chamber
when this bill was introduced here. It was
impossible for me to be present but I have
studied the bill and also read very carefully
in Hansard the excellent explanation of the
bill given by the honourable senator from
Winnipeg South (Hon. Mr. Thorvaldson) and
the informative and illuminating debate
which took place on second reading. I felt
the debate was certainly of an especially
high order and I would like to congratulate
those who took part, although as it is late
now I will not name them.
Although I am not a member of the
Committee on Banking and Commerce, I
have, nevertheless, either attended meetings
when the bill was considered, or read the
report of the meeting at which the bill was
discussed. I have also read the debates of
the other place on this bill, as well as the
reports of the committee of that house which
considered the bill. I cannot but feel that
because no opportunity was given to
interested groups and organizations to make
repres'entations before the committee of the
other house, that the members of that committee were deprived of a great deal of
information which they might have taken
into consideration when the bill came up
for third reading. I think it would have
been to their advantage had they been given
the opportunity to hear such representations.

AUGUST 28, 1958
Hon. Mr. Howard: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mrs. Fergusson: I am sure that if
they have taken the trouble to read the
reports of the Senate Banking and Commerce Committee, and the debates of this
house on the bill, they will realize that they
had not had the opportunity to know as
much about the matter as had the members
of the Senate who attended the Committee
on Banking and Commerce.
Honourable senators, I would like to say
that I do think this is a good bill. I think
it is an improvement on the Dominion Succession Duty Act which is now in force, but,
like the honourable senator from Toronto
(Hon. Mr. Hayden), I feel it could well be a
better bill. The principle of the bill which
provides for the tax to be levied on the mass
of the estate and not, as under the present
act, on the successor, certainly, as the minister said on committee, simplifies the
administration greatly. It is much easier
and quicker to calculate the tax by the
amount of the estate rather than by the
relationship of the individual successor to
the deceased. Now, although no tax bill is
really simple-at least, I cannot imagine a
simple one-I think the minister and his
associates should certainly be complimented
for this move toward simplification. I also
think they deserve the highest commendation for providing in the bill for a true
exemption of $40,000. For years organizations and various groups have asked that
there be a true exemption under the act,
and no doubt this provision is a result of
those representations over the years. However, most of those who have been pressing
for a true exemption feel that the amount
set out in the bill is too low. The Canadian
Federation of University Women has been
referred to by my honourable leader (Hon.
Mr. Macdonald)-and I must say he has
stolen my thunder to a certain extent.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I am very sorry.
Hon. Mrs. Fergusson: It is quite all right.
I am only going to support what you said.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: You can do it much
better than I could.
Hon. Mrs. Fergusson: I am glad to know
the federation had the support of my
honourable leader.
The Canadian Federation of University
Women have suggested a true exemption of
$50,000, and other groups have suggested
an even higher exemption. It would seem
to me that with the decrease in the value of
the dollar, $50,000 is a reasonable exemption,
and one that I would go along with myself.
But even with the simplification I have

mentioned, had I not had a little legal training and experience I think I would have had
great difficulty in understanding the provisions of the bill.
But, honourable senators, it is not as a
lawyer that I wish to speak to you today. I
speak to you as a woman on behalf of other
women. I feel that under the provisions of
this bill adequate consideration has not been
given to the work contributed to building up
the family fortunes by Canadian wives,
whether they work in a city or town home,
looking after its management and the health
of their husbands and children; or whether
they live on a farm, and besides having the
management of the home, help in the fields
and tend the stock; or whether, besides the
usual home responsibilities, they contribute
money they earn through employment outside
the home and thus swell the family coffers
to meet the current family expenses-money
which enables their husbands to use their
own earnings to purchase a home, or to accumulate savings in one form or another.
In recognition of this actual partnership, I
believe the Government should provide that
in cases where one spouse dies, half of the
accumulated estate shall, if it passes to the
other spouse, be considered for tax purposes
as having been earned by the surviving
spouse and be free of succession duty or
estate tax.
Hon. Mr. Howard: Hear, hear. There is no
question about that.
Hon. Mrs. Fergusson: As I said before, I
understand very well that the principle underlying this bill is the taxing of the estate
as a whole and not the taxing of the successors, but in cases such as this, women
believe they should not have to pay estate
tax on what they themselves have helped
to accumulate.
Now, honourable senators, I don't care
what principle is being introduced in this bill,
the women of Canada will never be satisfied
with it unless and until special allowance is
made whereby these contributions in cash or
in kind by Canadian wives, without whose
help most Canadian men will agree they
would never have accumulated a taxable
estate, are recognized and exempted from
taxation on the death of their husbands.
Canadian wives are in fact partners, are
recognized as such by their husbands and
should be recognized as such in estate tax
legislation.
When I read the minutes of the Banking
and Commerce Committee of the other place,
particularly the statements of the minister
on pages 16 and 17 of the report, I came to
the conclusion that the share of the surviving
spouse in joint property was exempt from

SENATE
taxation under the proposed act. I assure
honourable senators my disappointment was
very great when I later read in the minutes
of the Banking and Commerce Committee of
the Senate that this is not the case, and that
the share of joint property held by the surviving spouse, even though it would be free
of taxation under section 31(f) of the bill,
would be taxed under section 31(c), and that
a gift made prior to three years presumably
would be subject to gift tax. I had felt, after
reading the report of the committee of the
other place, that this would be of some benefit to widows. Now I am confused about it.
But in any case, any advantage that might
accrue is given to any joint owner, not particularly to a wife. There is no consideration
given to the wife for her contributions to the
joint estate in cash or kind. It may be that
if it is going to be of benefit to any joint
owner that, as I think was said in the committee, 75 per cent of those who benefit
would be wives, but the bill does not single
out wives for this consideration, and does not
give them any benefit there may be.
Now, it is true that the bill before us provides for a reduction of $60,000 in case of a
deceased male person who leaves a wife. No
doubt the framers of the bill felt they were
being very generous by providing this consideration for the wife; but as has been said
here earlier, under the bill the deduction
applies whether or not the property goes to the
wife; it does not actually acknowledge her
rights, and does not recognize in any way the
creation of a partnership between the two
persons. In any case, as I said in committee,
Canadian women who are looking for equality
and not for generous treatment would be
much happier to see in the Estate Tax Bill
a deduction which would allow the same
amount on the same conditions to a surviving
spouse, whether that spouse be male or
female.
Now, the provisions of the bill, it is true,
may have an overall beneficial de facto effect,
but the bill carefully avoids making any
special provisions for the wife. We must admit
that she was jointly responsible in building
up the estate, and she certainly under such a
bill should be given preferential treatment
over strangers. This has not been done.
Representatives of the Trust Companies
Association of Canada, which has 33 member
companies in the 10 provinces of Canada and
represents practically all Canadian corporations authorized by statute to administer
trusts, appeared before the committee of
this house-as I mentioned before, there was
no opportunity for them to appear before
the committee of the other house-and among
other representations, they expressed their
disappointment that in preparing this bill the

Government did not take advantage of the
opportunity to give recognition to the marital
deduction. The trust company representatives
also pointed out that the deduction provided
in the bill for a wife is generous, but it gives
no recognition of the fact that the creation
of the estate is as a result of a partnership
between husband and wife. They further
point out that the United States Federal
Estate Tax Act, which is based on the same
principle as this bill, that of taxing the mass
of the estate and not the successors-provides
that half of the estate may pass to the surviving spouse tax free.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Without limit
Hon. Mrs. Fergusson: Without limit.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Senator Bouffard suggested a limit of $200,000. You say the United
States is without limit?
Hon. Mrs. Fergusson: Without limit.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: It is without limit, but
he must leave it to his wife.
Hon. Mrs. Fergusson: Yes, but of what
value would it be to her to have such deduction if the estate were not left to her?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: That is what we could
not understand in this bill.
Hon. Mrs. Fergusson: A representative of
the Trust Companies Association further
pointed out that this concession was made in
the United States to equalize the advantages
that women enjoy in those states where there
is community of property. I believe there are
18 such states. Canada has a direct parallel
to that situation in that we have one
province which bas a régime of community
of property, and in that province a wife owns
half the family property at the death of her
husband.
If, as the trust companies state, the marital
deduction in the United States was granted
as a concession to equalize the advantages
that women enjoy in that country, why
should not a deduction be allowed in Canadian legislation to equalize throughout Canada
the advantages that accrue to women married
under the régime of community of property.
Representatives of several women's organizations appeared before the committee of this
house in support of their brief. I might say
that a copy of that brief was sent to all
senators on July 29, and thinking that each
senator would bring his copy to the meeting,
copies of the brief were not made available
in the committee.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: The women ought to
know better than that.
Hon. Mrs. Fergusson: They don't know the
senators as well as I do.

AUGUST 28, 1958
In that brief they set out among other
things their disappointment that, despite repeated submissions by thousands of Canadians, no recognition has been given by the
Government in this bill to the marriage
partnership. And, as the Leader of the Opposition (Hon. Mr. Macdonald) has said, in their
brief they set out their belief that one-half
of a deceased marriage partner's estate should,
if it passes to the surviving partner, be considered for tax purposes as earned by the surviving partner and not subject to estate tax.
May I tell honourable senators that these
women represented the Canadian Committee
on the Status of Women, the Canadian Federation of University Women, and the National
Council of Women which is often referred to
as the Parliament of Women in Canada. You
may not be aware of it, but the membership
in the National Council of Women extends
from coast to coast and numbers over 623,000.
It is also affiliated with the International
Council of Women which has affiliated federations throughout the world.
One of the points made by this group is
that when it is of advantage to the Government wives are considered as partners and
independent. This is illustrated by referring
to the War Veterans Allowance Act under
which, when a veteran applies for aid, he
must state his wife's income as well as his
own. The operation of that act denies an
allowance to a veteran whose wife can support him. Also, under the Veterans Land Act
one of the prime requisites demanded of a
would-be settler is that he have a wife who
is ready to work with him to develop the
property. Under the Small Loans Act a wife
must sign an application for a loan as well
as her husband, and under the National Housing Act a wife must sign a covenant to pay
and make herself responsible for payment.
Yet, honourable senators, if her husband dies
the Government regards the whole estate as
his and she bas to pay tax on it.
Now honourable senators, I point out too
that in the province of Alberta if a husband
is old, blind, lame or mentally deficient his
wife is required to provide maintenance, food,
clothing, medical care and lodging, just as he
is required to do for her under similar circumstances. So, obviously in that province the
husband and wife are regarded as partners
with equal responsibilities toward each other.
The common law has recognized the change
in the status of women, and that is pointed
out by Sir Alfred Denning in his book The
Changing Law. Lord Justice Denning gives
many illustrations of how the law is changing, the most striking of which is his account
of the way in which the common law has
57075-4-46

changed to recognize the change in the status
of women, and particularly the status of
wives.
Now, as all honourable senators who are
lawyers, and many others here, are aware,
the common law used to be that a husband
could beat his wife to correct her, that he
could give her orders which she must obey,
that if she refused to live where he chose,
this constituted desertion and a ground for
divorce, and that although a husband could
claim damages from another for taking his
wife away, a wife could not sue another
woman for luring away her husband. Honourable senators, all these rules have been
reversed by the courts without acts of Parliament. They are the common law. Lord
Justice Denning believes that the courts no
longer regard the wife as handling housekeeping money merely on behalf of her husband, but that the trend of recent cases is
towards the "modern idea that husband and
wife are partners in all affairs which are
their common concern." A number of Canadian courts have also recognized this principle, and I would be glad to give the citations
to any honourable senators who are interested.
With respect to the question of the financial
value of the work done by a housewife, I
would like to tell you of a survey done in
England and reported in the Toronto Globe
and Mail of July 10 last. The article tells
about efforts on the part of statisticians to
find out the actual money value of the services which a wife gives in the home. To do
that, they removed the wife from the home,
and hired in her place other persons to do
the work she had been doing. They hired a
charwoman, a baby-sitter, a cook-as the
hour is getting late, I shall not enumerate
them all-and various other persons who
were required to do the work the wife had
been doing. The amount paid to these other
persons for their services totalled $5,165.10
a year. And I should add, that even with
this high cost of services, the children were
not as happy and life was not as smooth as
under the wife's care. This calculation does
not take account of the fact that if the wife
had been in the home she would have done
interior decorating, mending and knitting
which, if the husband had to pay for it all,
would have cost him an additional $270. So,
I submit, honourable senators, the worth of
the wife in the home is very substantial.
American women from early pioneer days
have had to be helpmates and equals with
their men. They had to share the hardships
of frontier life, but they were allowed to
share the rewards as well. When life became easier, not only the tradition of equality
and partnership remained, but, what is less
often mentioned, there also remained the

SENATE

concept of marriage as a job. That is the
attitude of American men and women today,
that housekeeping and homemaking is a job,
a business at which the wife works hard, and
her work should be recognized as such.
This no doubt is one of the reasons, together
with the fact that a number of States, although
not all, have community of property, that
the United States Federal Estate Tax Act,
which is based on the same principle as the
one before us of taxing the estate and not
the succession, allows for a marital deduction
by which half of the estate passes to the
surviving spouse free of tax.
Honourable senators, I submit that Canadian wives have ever since pioneer days
proven themselves to be equally as good helpmates as American wives. As we too have at
least one province where there is community
of property, why should not Canadian wives
have equal recognition under the Canadian
Estate Tax Act as American wives have under
the United States Federal Estate Tax Act,
which is based on the same principle?
If the bill could be explained to every
housewife-simple as it is, I do not think I
would want to undertake it-I am sure every
one of them would feel that there should
be a relaxation of the principle of the Estate
Tax Bill to provide for the recognition of the
partnership between husband and wife, as is
donc in the United States.
This point was argued before the Senate
Standing Committee on Banking and Commerce by the reoresentatives of women's
organizations, without avail, but that is not
to say the argument was invalid. Public
opinion in the long run-and indeed the run
may not be too long-will demand that there
be some relaxation in the application of the
principle of the bill, and adequate recognition
of the special contribution made by a wife
to the value of her deceased husband's estate.
Honourable senators, Canada has given
leadership in recognizing the status of
women. We have an Equal Pay Act; we have
signed the United Nations Convention on the
Political Rights of Women; we have a woman
cabinet minister. This year for the first time
Canada is a member of the Commission on
the Status of Women of the United Nations.
Although this is the first year we have been
a member, and we are under a new Government, I think it only fair to say that all
arrangements for Canada becoming a member
were made under the régime of the Honourable Lester B. Pearson. I speak from personal
knowledge in this respect, having had a great
many conversations with him and his department on this subject. I was, therefore, very
pleased when the decision was made by the

previous Government that Canada was interested in becoming a member of that commission, and when Canada was chosen as one
of the members. For these reasons, Canada
is looked to for leadership in the field of
women's rights by the less-advanced or morebackward countries.
I should like to quote a few lines from
the report of the Secretary-General of the
United Nations on the latest meeting of the
Commission on the Status of Women. The
commission had discussed the program of
work which should be undertaken by the
Economic and Social Council. I read from
the report:
In the program of work recommended by the
commission for adoption by the council, the ad hoc
projects of high priority were divided into two
groups: those required for the thirteenth session of
the commission, and those postponed until the
fourteenth session.
The first group includes two projects decided upon
at the eleventh session in 1957: tax legislation
applicable to women-

and one other prospect. That question is
apparently of great interest to the commission. Now, because Canada is a member of
that commission, her own internal laws dealing with the subject have more significance
than they otherwise would have had.
If, honourable senators, when passing a new
tax law we refuse to recognize the change that
is taking place, that women now actually are
partners and not dependents, we are failing
te give the leadership that might be expected
of us as a member of the Status of Women
Commission of the United Nations.
Hon. Mr. Golding: Would the honourable
senator permit a question?
Hon. Mrs. Fergusson: Certainly.
Hon. Mr. Golding: I was wondering
whether the women's organizations had made
any estimate or had any statistics on the
percentage of women who might be affected
by the passage of this bill?
Hon. Mrs. Fergusson: No, I do not have
such information.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Not one in a hundred,
in our country.
Hon. Mrs. Fergusson: I can't believe that.
May I ask if the honourable Leader has
made an estimate or has any statistics?
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: That is my estimate,
and I can tell by the number of estates that
go through my office. Only one in a great
number pay any succession duty at all.

Hon. Mr. Pouliot inquired of the Government, pursuant to notice:
For a copy of the charts of each one of the
Departments of the Canadian Government and of
the Crown companies, owned and controlled by
the Canadian Government, indicating the various
positions, the number of employees, and their
classifications.

Hon. Mr. Aseltine: I have the following
answer to this inquiry:
The recent publication by the Queen's Printer, in
both languages, called Organization of the Government of Canada dated June, 1958, provides the
charts requested in the first part of this inquiry.
Details of services in the estimates for the fiscal
year ending March 31, 1959 contain the number of
employees in each of the Government departments.
However, in the interest of the Crown corporations
or the personnel, it has not been the practice to
make available the salary arrangements or remunerations paid to the Crown company employees.

Well, we have a bill which proposes to

yet no notice on the Order Paper with respect "The Broadcasting Debate":
to a bill to amend the Radio Act. Also in
It is unfortunate that the House of Commons
the Throne Speech, which His Excellency became divided on the new broadcasting legislation, but under the circumstances this was almost
read on May 12, is this statement:
You will be asked to set up a Select Committee

on Broadcasting-

Well, it is now August 28, and I don't
think we will be here any longer than two
more weeks; therefore, we can take it for
granted that, notwithstanding the Speech
from the Throne, no Select Committee on
Broadcasting will be set up in the other
house this session. As a matter of fact, in
the other house the Broadcasting Bill was
dealt with in Committee of the Whole. Under
all these circumstances, I feel we should not
let this bill pass through the Senate without
referring it to one of our standing committees.
Honourable senators would, I am sure, be
interested in a short article on the history of
broadcasting which was written by Frank
Swanson and recently published in the Ottawa
Citizen. I was interested to learn from it
that the first piece of radio legislation was
enacted in 1905, although sound broadcasting,
as it is known today, was not introduced for
another 14 years. The Wireless Telegraph Act
of 1905 provided that no person could establish any wireless telegraph station or any
apparatus for wireless telegraphy without a
licence granted by the Minister of Marine
and Fisheries. So this type of legislation dates
back to 1905.
The first bill relating to broadcasting was
entitled the Canadian Radio Broadcasting
Commission Bill. It was passed in 1932 by
the Bennett administration, based upon the
report of the Aird Commission, which had
been appointed in 1928. The commission reported in 1929 and its findings were under
study until 1932, but the bill, after receiving
second reading, was referred to a Commons
committee which studied it for more than
six weeks. Just compare what took place in
connection with that legislation with what is
taking place now. In 1936 new broadcasting
legislation was brought in under the régime
of the late W. L. Mackenzie King. On that
occasion the bill, after receiving second reading, was studied for two months by a committee of the other house, and it resulted in
the establishment of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. The point is that in both
those instances the legislation was brought

into effect only after exhaustive examination.
There has been considerable criticism

inevitable. This is far too important a matter to
ram down Parliament's throat In the dying days
of the session, and indeed if there was ever a case
of disregard of the rights of Parliament, this Is it.

The editorial goes on to relate what took
place in connection with former bills:
Today, despite the protestations of Mr. George
Nowlan on behalf of the Government, there are
serious misgivings as to some features of the new
bill, and these have been expressed outside Parliament as well as by the Liberal and CCF members of the Commons. The Canadian Federation
of Agriculture and the Canadian Labor Congress
both have reservations as to whether Canadian
broadcasting will be sustained (in the words of
the CFA) "as a single system, under an independent authority, of which both public and private
stations are part."

Since that editorial was written, another
organization, the Canadian Broadcasting
League, has also expressed grave doubts
in connection with this matter.
The editorial from which I have been reading ends with the following words:
The government has declined to consider
amendments to its bill, even changes that
spell out with greater clarity the objects

taining the single national system.

It remains to be seen whether the Senate will
attempt to introduce changes and whether, if that
happens, the government will treat its suggestions in the same cavalier manner as those coming
from the opposition benches in the Commons.

In tonight's Citizen there is an editorial
entitled, "An Affront To Parliament". I will
not read the entire editorial, but just a portion at the end:
Yet this dumping of broadcasting policy into
the arena of party politics might have been avoided
had the government Introduced its legislation at an
earlier stage of the session, when there would have
been opportunity enough for thorough study and
discussion by a select committee, which indeed the
government itself once said ought to be set up
for the purpose.

Honourable senators, I do not need to delay
you longer. I am sure all will agree it is
indeed unfortunate that this very important
bill comes to us at this late date. I think
it is fair to say that in general the bill
follows the recommendation of the Fowler
Commission, although of course there are
many changes. I am very pleased to admit
there are some good features to the bill
which should result in giving more enjoyment to both radio and television listeners

SENATE

and viewers. On the other hand, I fear
there is great danger that our national system will be relegated to a position where it
will become just another commercial organization competing for the advertiser's dollar.
One of the favourable features I recognize
in the bill is that it divides the broadcasting
system into an operating branch and a regulating branch. I think it was inevitable that
when these two branches were under the
C.B.C. there would be some dissatisfaction
among the private stations when they had
to bow to regulations made by the C.B.C.,
although I think in very few instances was
there any ground for complaint in that regard.
However, the feeling was there, and we can
call it psychological, or whatever it might
be. I am pleased that the Government has
followed the recommendation of the Fowler
Commission and proposed the setting up of
the two branches. With the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation acting in a dual capacity,
both in making regulations and passing judgment on broadcasting, it was inevitable that
some disagreement would be caused. The bill
separates the two functions, that is, the operating features and the regulatory features.
The latter is under a Board of Broadcast
Governors, composed of fifteen members,
three of whom are to be full time and twelve
part time. The full-time members are to be
appointed to hold office during good behaviour
for a period of seven years; and the part-time
members, during good behaviour for a period
of five years. One full-time member, the
chairman, is the chief executive, and the
other full-time member is the vice-chairman.
There are three full-time members, but just
what the third full-time member does I do
not know, and I cannot see that it is set forth
in the bill.
The Canadian Broadcasting Corporation
consists of a President, a Vice-President and
nine other directors, being eleven in all. The
President and Vice-President are appointed to
hold office during pleasure for a period of
seven years, and the directors are appointed
to hold office during good behaviour for a
period of three years. Under the provisions
of this bill, therefore, 25 appointments will
be made by the Government.
Honourable senators, I want to pay tribute
to the private stations, both radio and television. I think they have given splendid
service in their communities, and I know,
over the years, what a small radio station
has meant to a community, and also what
these so-called small television stations mean
to the communities which they serve. I would
not wish to suggest that they should not
continue to operate. What disturbs me is
that this bill proposes the setting up of
competing networks throughout Canada. I

glanced through the Fowler Report last night
and I could not find any suggestion in it for
the setting up of networks among private
stations-that does not mean only network
radio stations, but also network television
stations. In the United States, where there
are 170 million people, they are able to
support three main television networks,
namely, the Columbia Broadcasting System,
the American Broadcasting Company, and the
National Broadcasting Corporation.
Hon. Mr. Brun±: And the Mutual Broadcasting System.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: But, honourable senators, there are 170 million people in the
United States. I cannot see how Canada, with
a population of 17 million scattered from the
Atlantic on the east to the Pacific on the west,
with a large part of the territory sparsely
populated, can support competing networks,
especially television networks. I am just afraid
that if this is done the Canadian Broadcasting
Corporation network will have to compete
with these other networks for the advertiser's
dollar, and if it is to balance its budget it
will have to cut down its programs, bring
them down to a pretty low level compared
with what they are today. If that is not done
the cost of operating the C.B.C. network will
greatly increase; and if it puts on programs
which are so much better than the canned
programs which are bound to come into this
country the private networks will be at a
disadvantage. I can see nothing but confusion
ahead for broadcasting in Canada if we are
going to have competing networks, especially
in television.
Also, honourable senators, I am afraid that
the independence and the efficiency of the
C.B.C. is going to be undermined. This is
very likely to happen, because two boards
are going to be set up, and this bill does not
give the C.B.C. clear control of its own networks. The C.B.C. may be prevented from
expanding when it is required to do so.
Honourable senators will notice that section
3 of the bill provides that the full-time members of the Board of Broadcast Governors
will be appointed to hold office during good
behaviour for seven years, and the part-time
members during good behaviour, for five
years. Then if we look at section 22 of the
bill we notice that the directors will hold
office during pleasure for a period of seven
years.
What does all this mean? I do not see how
anyone could hold office if he did not behave
properly.
Hon. Mr. Brunt: Is that not the same provision that is in the Judges Act, that they hold
office during pleasure and good behaviour?

SENATE
of Canada. I assume that the present
Canadian Broadcasting League is a later
outgrowth of it. The original organization
started as an educational and propaganda
institution before the first commission was
set up. At one time it was headed by
Mr. Graham Spry, who is now Agent General
for Saskatchewan in London. Another very
active young man in the league was the late
Allan Plaunt. These two men did a great
deal to create public opinion favourable to
the establishment of a broadcast system in
Canada, before the act was originally
brought down and before the first commission was set up.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I am indebted to the
senior senator from Ottawa for that information. I had only the general knowledge that
it was a reputable body.
Let me read the last sentence of the

Hon. Mr. Haig: It is the same thing.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: No, it is quite different. The Government would approve or
disapprove of what was done, and the Minister of National Revenue would report to
Parliament.

AUGUST 28, 1958
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: A five-year plan is
being worked out, as an alternative suggestion, which is just the opposite to the recommendation of the Fowler Commission. The
commission recommended that with respect to
capital expenditures there should be a oneyear plan, but this bill provides that there be
a five-year plan for capital expenditures.
In order to keep its hand on the C.B.C., and
instead of providing the five-year period of
financing, the Government says it will get one
year at a time-which is contrary to the
Fowler recommendation-and it bas to go to
the Minister of Finance every year to get
more money, if required.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Has not the C.B.C. been
doing that anyway, in addition to getting its
appropriation?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: No. Its reporting in
the past has been entirely different than what
it is proposed to be done under this bill.
For some reason or other the Government
does not want to give the C.B.C. the money
necessary to carry on its operations for five
years because, I suppose, it would be free
from Parliament and the Government of the
day. The Fowler Commission recommended
the contrary, but the Government bas chosen
to pay no attention to that recommendation.
An excellent editorial appeared in the
Globe and Mail of July 24, which was before
the bill was introduced. I will read it, in part:
The Fowler Commission recommended that C.B.C.
be relieved of control over private broadcasting,
and that all broadcasting be brought under an independent authority.

The honourable senior senator from Winnipeg (Hon. Mr. Haig) asked me if there was
nothing good in the bill. I say that is a very
good feature of it, and the editorial agrees.
It continues:
The commission recommended that private stations be allowed to compete with C.B.C. in its
monopoly areas. This, too. should be done. And
the commission recommended that C.B.C. be given
a defined responsibility based on stern, but adequate
and continuous long-range financing.

Well, honourable senators, the bill does not
do that.
Hon. Mr. Bruni: Does the editorial refer
to capital financing?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: No, it refers to broadcasting.
My friend the senior senator from Winnipeg asked me to read the whole article to
which I previously referred. I will read
the closing sentence of it.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Be fair and read the whole
article.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I could read the parts
of the article he would like to have read, but
I don't think I will.

Hon. Mr. Haig: As a matter of fact, I was
going to object to your reading the editorial,
because you are out of order in reading such
things on the floor of the house.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: This is not an
editorial.
Hon. Mr. Haig: But the Globe and Mail
article was.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Very well; I won't
read the editorial. I have already quoted
from it.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Yes, and I didn't stop
you.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I do not think in
my reading from the Globe and Mail editorial
I was out of order, because it was written
long before this bill was presented to
Parliament.
Hon. Mr. Haig: You can't read it anyway.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: It had no relationship
to this bill, and of course I was in order in
reading from it.
I am reading from the representation
which was made. It states:
The League is disappointed that the bill makes
the C.B.C. dependent on annual grants from Parliament.
The provision for a five-year capital
draft program is an improvement. But It is not
enough. The bill should provide a formula by
which the C.B.C. would be assured of a predictable revenue for a definite period of years, thus
providing a further guarantee of the C.B.C.'s Independence from partisan influence.

That is the statement of the reputable
men whose names were mentioned a few
minutes ago by the honourable senior senator
from Ottawa (Hon. Mr. Lambert). Many
people throughout the country are very much
concerned as to whether this Canadian
Broadcasting Corporation, which has rendered
such wonderful service to Canada over the
past years, is now to be relegated to the
position of a strictly commercial organization. I sincerely hope that will not be so.
I trust the good intentions of the Government will be put into effect not only by this
administration but by Governments yet to
come. But in spite of the reassurances of
the minister in the other bouse, the text of
the bill leaves unanswered the question
whether the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation is to have the authority and the freedom
to maintain a good national service. As
the Ottawa Journal bas said-I will not quote
it at length-if the present bill is passed without a full answer to that question, we senators
will not be doing our work.
I feel very keenly about this bill. I do
not know whether it is the intention of the
honourable Leader of the Government (Hon.
Mr. Aseltine) to propose that it should go
to a committee, but I think that that course
is essential. The bill provides for the setting

SENATE

up of regulations, and the operation of the
Canadian Broadcasting Corporation will depend very largely on the content of those
regulations. It is true they will not be drawn
up until after the new Canadian Broadcasting
Corporation organization is set up, and they
will be tabled in this house at the next
session. But when the bill comes before us
we should inquire carefully into these regulations and note what they contain. The
success or failure of the C.B.C. under the
provisions of this bill depend largely on how
it is operated, and on the quality, the industry and the vision of those who are appointed
on these boards.
Hon. W. M. Aseltine: Honourable senators,
I would like to make a few remarks with
regard to this measure. For 15 years or
longer there has been a great deal of discussion from time to time, both within and
without Parliament, with respect to radio
broadcasting, and I believe honpurable
senators will agree that at times the controversy became quite heated. As a result, a
royal commission was set up by Parliament
in December, 1955 to investigate and report
on broadcasting in Canada. The members
of that commission were: R. M. Fowler, chairman, E. Turcotte and James Stewart, commissioners. This body became known as the
Fowler Commission. It held meetings throughout Canada, heard delegations and obtained
information from many sources, and worked
for nearly one and a half years before
bringing in its report, on March 15, 1957.
I have that report on my desk, and I have
read it with much interest. It contains much
good information, and it is a very important
report. No steps, however, were taken to
implement any part of it until quite recently, when this Bill C-55 was brought
down. No doubt the reason for the delay
is that shortly after the commission reported there was an election, followed by
another election some six or eight months
afterwards.
I wish to refer, honourable senators, to
an extract from the report which will be
found at page 91, and which was referred
to indirectly by the honourable Leader of
the Opposition (Hon. Mr Macdonald):
The other public agency in the Canadian broadcasting field should be a board created and authorized to act for Parliament, and responsible to
Parliament, for the direction and supervision of
This board
the Canadian Broadcasting system.
should have responsibility for all elements in
Canadian broadcasting. It should not, we suggest,
be a part of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation
and its members should not, as in the present
statute, comprise the Corporation. . . . This board
is not part of the C.B.C. and should not be referred
to as 'the Board of Governors of C.B.C.'. We suggest that a new board, differently named, should
be created by statute. The name we use in speaking of this agency is 'The Board of Broadcast

Governors.' It could equally well have been 'The
Board of Governors of Canadian Broadcasting' or
'The Governors of the Canadian Broadcasting
System' or any other name that does not identify
it with the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation.

Honourable senators, it was in view of
that recommendation that the bill we have
before us was brought down by the present
Government. The object of the legislation
is to implement that report as far as possible,
because since 1955 some uncertainty has
prevailed with reference to the C.B.C. It was
thought that it would be unfair to the C.B.C. if
this uncertainty continued, and that the
situation should be clarified so that C.B.C.
and private stations would know where they
stand and what is ahead of them. That is
the object of the bill.
As has been said by the honourable Leader
of the Opposition, it was inadvisable for the
C.B.C. to act in a dual capacity, enacting
regulations, applying regulations and passing
judgment. Consequently, I believe that this
bill will be welcomed by everyone interested
in broadcasting.
I have read the measure many times. I
like its draftsmanship, and if honourable
senators will refer to it they will see that
the headings are clearly set out and there is
simplicity of expression. I think it is a good
bill and a step in the right direction; but as
the honourable Leader of the Opposition has
said, it may not be perfect in every respect.
In my opinion, however, it is an honest effort
by the Government to solve the problem
which has been hanging over the broadcasting industry for the last 15 years. This bill,
which has been based on the Fowler Commission Report, sets up a board to be called
the Board of Broadcasting Governors. This
is the precise name suggested by the Fowler
Commission in the extract which I read from

page 91 of the report. After providing for
membership, tenure of office, age limit,
oath of office, head office, meetings, quorums,
remuneration, staff, superannuation, and
things like that, it sets out in paragraph 10
the objects and purposes of the board, as
follows:
The board shall, for the purpose of ensuring the
continued existence and efficient operation of a
national broadcasting system and the provision
of a varied and comprehensive broadcasting service of a high standard that is basically Canadian
in content and character, regulate the establishment and operation of networks of broadcasting
stations, the activities of public and private broadcasting stations in Canada and the relationship
between them and provide for the final determination of ail matters and questions in relation thereto.

Part I of the bill then goes on to deal with
regulations, licences, networks, non-Canadian
interests, suspension of licences, prohibitions and penalties, and so forth. The next
important section is section 19, which deals

with reports to Parliament, which are to be

AUGUST 28, 1958
made within three months of the end of each
fiscal year.
I find myself unable to agree with the
honourable Leader of the Opposition when he
says that this is a major change and entirely
different from what we have under the act
incorporating the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. I cannot see any difference between
reporting to the Minister of National Revenue
and reporting to the Minister of Finance.
I am not going to say anything more now
about Part I of the bill but I would like to
say something about Part II.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: May I interrupt to
ask the honourable Leader one question? Is
he suggesting that in future the Minister of
Finance will be responsible to Parliament for
the operation of this legislation? Is it not true
that it will still come under the supervision
of the Minister of National Revenue? In other
words, the Minister of Finance will be responsible for money and the Minister of National
Revenue will look after all the other features.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: I don't think I indicated
anything like that.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I believe that is the
fact.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: A few moments ago I
said that Part I of the bill deals with regulations, licences, networks and so forth. I should
have pointed out that the regulations which
the board may make are covered by paragraphs (a) to (i) inclusive of section 11 of the
bill. I don't think the honourable Leader
opposite should have any qualms, forebodings
or fears that regulations will be made which
will have a detrimental effect on the Canadian
Broadcasting Corporation.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I would still like to
examine them very carefully.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Of course, we will all
want to examine them carefully.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: May I ask the honourable Leader a question?
Hon. Mr. AselIine: Yes.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: The C.B.C. is a Crown
corporation. WiL the appointment of a Board
of Broadcast Governors change the status of
the C.B.C. in this respect? The honourable
leader spoke of a number of functions belonging to the C.B.C. which would be handed
over to the new board.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: In my opinion the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation will still be a
Crown corporation. The bill provides that:
The corporation established by the Canadian
Broadcasting Act and the corporation established

by Part II of this act are hereby declared for ail
purposes to be one and the saine corporation.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: Would it be fair to
assume that the Board of Broadcast Governors

would be the Board of Directors of this Crown
corporation?
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: No, there is no function
like that.
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): Did I
understand the honourable Leader to say that
the Board of Broadcast Governors and the
Board of the C.B.C. will be one and the same?
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: No.
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): Would
the honourable gentleman refer me to the
section he just read? I did not hear him;
that is why I asked the question.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: It is section 38 in Part
III of the bill.
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): Yes.
Thank you.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: According to section
38 it is one corporation.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: One and the same
corporation.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Yes.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: What is wrong with
that?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Well, I thought you
said they were not.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Oh, no. Part II reestablishes the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation and re-enacts most of the provisions
and sections of the Canadian Broadcasting
Act. It makes clear provision for the carrying on of that corporation as a Crown
corporation. That was gone into fully by the
sponsor of the bill, and somewhat fully by
the Leader of the Opposition a short time
ago. I do not intend to deal with the provisions except to say that in my opinion the
C.B.C. will be placed in a stronger position
to carry out its work than ever before.
I would like to make a few remarks with
regard to the more or less socialistic speech
made by the honourable senator from
Toronto-Spadina (Hon. Mr. Croll). I agree
fully and heartily with what he said about
the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation and
the good work it has done in the past and
is doing now. I also wish to pay tribute to the
former chairman of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, Mr. Dunton, whom I
have known personally for some time.
Returning to the speech of the honourable
member from Toronto-Spadina, it seemed to
me that he had a lot of fears about this,
that and the other thing. He said he fears
that the two boards may weaken the C.B.C.
Well, I cannot see where there could be any
such effect, or in what way the two boards
could weaken the C.B.C., and he gave no
reasons for fearing this, at least none that I

SENATE
could follow. He said that competition might
arise between the C.B.C. board and the board
that is proposed to be set up under Part 1,
but he gave no reasons for thinking that
might happen. He thinks the bill will give
private stations a monopoly, but he does not
say how that can come about. He is afraid
that this proposed act may weaken the concept of public ownership. He expressed all
these forebodings, without anything that I
could find in his speech to back them up.
I think he was splitting hairs when he said
that the C.B.C. will have to go to the Government each year for the funds. It does that
now, even though there is an appropriation of
so much a year. It has not been able to
operate within the limits of that amount, and
it has had to come to Parliament every year
to get a further appropriation, if I am correct.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: It does not go to the
Minister of Finance, though.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: It is the same thing, in
my opinion, but I may be wrong.
This bill does provide, in section 35, that a
five-year program is to be worked out.
The honourable senator from TorontoSpadina concluded his remarks by saying he
found no comfort in the bill and he would

Hon. Mr. Lamberi: Will my honourable
friend tell us who are the heads of the
Canadian Broadcasting League?
Hon. Mr. Aselline: This document was sent
to me in the mail. I think all senators received
a copy.
Nothing has been done, in my opinion, to
impair the C.B.C., and if I thought anything
was being done in that direction I certainly
would not vote for the bill. The bill tends
to strengthen and develop the C.B.C.
I do not wish to say much with respect
to the remarks of the honourable Leader of
the Opposition (Hon. Mr. Macdonald), but
I must point out that if we did not have
a television station in the city of Saskatoon,
and in the city of Regina, we would not have
any television worth a cent, in the province
of Saskatchewan. The C.B.C. works through
these stations, and that is how we get the
programs.
Hon. Mr. Bruni: Those are privately owned
stations.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Those are privately
owned stations; we cannot possibly get along
without them, and I do not believe the C.B.C.
could operate successfully without them, because it would not be able to give service to
oppose it.

I think that is a recommendation.

AUGUST 28, 1958
I am inclined to agree with the statement
made by the Minister of National Revenue
in the other bouse, that the uncertainty of
the present interregnum should be ended,
and this bill makes an attempt to bring it
to an end. The delay has not been good
for the morale of the organization nor for the
future planning of national broadcasting in
Canada.
Like some of the other senators who have
spoken previously, I hope that rushing this
bill through in the dying days of the session
will not prohibit the setting up of a joint
Parliamentary committee next session to study
carefully the regulations which will be evolved
as time goes on. This bill could turn out to
be a very good bill or a very poor one, depending on the people who administer it. We
have every right to expect that the Government will appoint capable people to the board,
but there is also a duty on Parliament to
examine the regulations next session.
With regard to the bill itself, I think it is
good in this respect, that it implements some
of the main recommendations of the Fowler
Commission. But there are one or two matters
about which I think we should be careful.
Unquestionably from the administrative point
of view, two boards functioning in such closely
related fields are cumbersome and clumsy.
Nevertheless this was the recommendation of
the Fowler Commission, and I see no satisfactory way of avoiding the two boards. In
theory, there should be no problem in two
boards; in practice, it sometimes happens that
frictions, jealousies, and personalities clash.
This happens even in university circles where
federal and provincial agencies are operating
on the same campus, not always in a spirit
of co-operation. However, it remains to be
seen whether the bad potentials develop,
rather than the good ones.
There is one factor which may play a part
in determining the success of the relationship
between the two boards. In the broadcasting
field where financial incentive of the private
broadcasters will play a part, the Government
will be exceedingly fortunate if it does not
find itself in a position where the two boards
-the Broadcast Governors and the C.B.C.are not working in harmony.
The legislation provides, in effect, for two
networks, one public and one private. Now, I
realize it does not need to provide two networks, but in looking over the experience of
the past number of years, and the constant
chipping away at the C.B.C., I think honourable senators will admit that there is a possibility that one of the first things that the
private broadcasters will try to establish is
a separate private network for both radio
and television. I feel that the private stations
will lose no time in evolving their own network system, and having done this they will

increasingly assert and claim a right to profitable operation of that system, and will
create a hue and cry to eliminate the C.B.C.
from competition. The argument has already
been used on many occasions that public
enterprise should not compete with private
enterprise, and I feel that this argument will
be increasingly used under the new legislation. I feel that it cannot be too strongly
emphasized that there are certain areas of
public policy in which national interest dictates that the public enterprise must have a
prior right, and I feel that public broadcasting
and TV constitute one of those areas.
I think the people of Canada cannot abdicate the right to a publicly controlled
national system of broadcasting and television. In saying this, I wish in no way to
reflect on the role of the private broadcasters,
many of whom have performed and are performing a fine community service and have
been generous in giving support to every
worthwhile community enterprise. However,
one has only to make a comparison between
the quality of programs put on by many of
the smaller stations in the United States with
those of the average station in Canada to
see what can happen unless most rigid standards of broadcasting are maintained.
Now, coming to Part II of the bill, I wish
to refer specifically to section 22, subsection
5, which reads:
A person is not eligible to be appointed or to
continue as a director of the Corporation If he is
not a Canadian citizen, or if, directly or indirectly,
as owner, shareholder, director, officer, partner or
otherwise, he is engaged in the business of broadcasting or has any pecuniary or proprietary interest
in a broadcasting station or in the manufacture
or distribution of radio apparatus.

In view of the very close relationship
existing between radio stations and newspapers in some instances, I think it must
also be clearly indicated that representatives
of newspapers who have interests in radio
stations should also be barred.
Hon. Mr. Bruni: Barred?
Hon. Mr. Cameron: Yes.
Hon. Mr. Bruni: Was that one of the
recommendations of the Fowler report, that
newspapers be allowed to acquire radio
stations?
Hon. Mr. Cameron: They have them now.
Hon. Mr. Bruni: That is right. At one time
I understood it was the policy of the Government that no newspaper could operate a
radio station. The Fowler report recommended a change that would permit newspapers to have an interest in or control a
radio station.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Is my friend referring to
the Board of Governors?
Hon. Mr. Bruni: I am sorry. I misunderstood.

SENATE
Hon. Mr. Cameron: The newspapers had
interests in radio stations long before the
Fowler report. At one time it was suggested
care should be taken that members of organizations should not become members of the
ooard.
Hon. Mr. Power: Would my honourable
friend not also be of opinion that no person
disqualified under this section 22(5) as an
owner or a shareholder etc., of a broadcasting business or a newspaper proprietor,
should be a member of the Board of Broadcast Governors? It is far more important
in that case than in the case of the C.B.C.,
because members of the Board of Broadcast
Governors decide the persons to whom
licences shall be issued and, so to speak, are
referees as between the C.B.C. and private
stations.
Hon. Mr. Cameron: I would agree wholeheartedly with that.
In saying this I do not wish to reflect on
a number of very competent people who
would thus be eliminated from nomination
as members of these boards, but I think it is
imperative that they not be allowed to sit
on the board.
I feel it is important to Canada that the
role of the C.B.C. in the national life should
be strengthened rather than weakened.
Again, I am not implying that this bill will
unduly weaken the role of the C.B.C., but
it could do so under wrong or misguided
direction.
Years ago in Canada there were several
university stations. I had the responsibility
of directing one of them for 10 years, so I
know something of the work they were doing.
I believe that now there is only one parttime university station in operation, and I
am not sure that even that one is functioning effectively today.
Hon. Mr. Bruni: What station has the
honourable senator in mind?
Hon. Mr. Cameron: The one at Kingston.
Hon. Mr. Bruni: It is still operating.
Hon. Mr. Cameron: Yes, but all the others
have disappoared.
The disappearance of the university radio
stations from the scene bas meant that the
C.B.C. has taken over the educational and
cultural role originally played by them.
That is an important factor to keep in mind.
As an example that I am personally familiar
with, the University of Alberta Round Table
was the forerunner of Citizens' Forum; the
University Farm Broadcast Program eventually evolved into Farm Radio Forum. The
University station was doing similar programs, but the C.B.C. could do them better
with its larger resources.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: Did Mr. Aberhart
broadcast over that station?

Hon. Mr. Cameron: No, he did not.
These are good and important programs,
and there will be a need to continue them
and to foster others in the future.
It is with the general picture of what
is happening in Canada that I am primarily
concerned. There never was a time in our
history when Canada needed a national voice
so badly, a voice constantly sounding the
language, the feelings and aspirations of the
Canadian people. In the last ten years we
have witnessed in Canada the first burgeoning of a distinctive and vital Canadian
culture. One has only to look to the exciting
things that have been happening in recent
years in the field of letters, in the first living
Canadian theatre, as exemplified by the
developments in Montreal in particular and
to a lesser extent in Toronto and development of such institutions as the Stratford
Festival, the Vancouver Festival and even
our own in Alberta. In the encouragement
of all of these activities in whieh Canadians
are beginning to develop some maturity and
a sense of nationhood the C.B.C. has played
a great role of encouragement and help. The
C.B.C. radio and TV have provided, for the
first time in Canada, a market for Canadian
writing, employment opportunities for Canadian actors and artists, and it is a national
responsibility to see that this opportunity
continues.
Some may argue that this bill need not
weaken the C.B.C. or the cultural growth and
development which it has encouraged in such
important ways. This is true, as it is also
true that certain private stations have, in
their own way, encouraged Canadian talent,
but the primary responsibility of the private
stations to their shareholders is not to serve
national interests in the educational or cultural fields; and if the situation comes about
when it becomes a choice between the profitable operation of the station or the encouragement of the national interest as represented
by these cultural programs, then the private
interest as opposed to the national interest

will prevail. It may be argued too that it is
the Government's responsibility to look after
the national interest, and this is true, but the
same people who will not wish to provide the
expensive and non-profitable cultural programs will be the first to raise a hue and cry
about the high cost of these programs to the
Canadian taxpayer and to put the national
broadcasting corporation in a bad light. In
this way they can influence public opinion
and under the new set-up make it increasingly
difficult for the C.B.C. to get the annual appropriations through Parliament, necessary
to its effective functioning.
Recently organizations such as the Canadian Federation of Agriculture, the Canadian
Labour Congress, the Canadian Broadcasting

AUGUST 28, 1958
League and others have voiced concern about
the weakening of the position of public broadcasting. The passage of this legislation will
involve a new and greater responsibility on
all organizations concerned with the national
welfare, to be vigilant in seeing that the act
is made to work not to the disadvantage of
public broadcasting but to its benefit.
I hope, honourable senators, that provision
will be made for a most complete inquiry
year by year into the functioning and working of this proposed act.
Hon. W. D. Euler: Honourable senators, I
have not made a very close study of the bill.
I rise now, first to ask a question and,
secondly, to make a few observations and to
express a hope for the future.
The question was asked by the Leader of
the Opposition (Hon. Mr. Macdonald), butI am not suggesting there is any sinister implication-it was not answered. I think we
should have an explanation as to why subsection 2 of section 22 provides that the
President and Vice-President of the Canadian
Broadcasting Corporation shall be appointed
to hold office during pleasure, but that the
other directors shall hold office during good
behaviour. Perhaps my friend would answer
that question after I have made my
observations.
I would call attention to section 14, which
has to do with the issuing of licences to nonCanadian interests. It reads:
The board shall not recommend the issue of a
licence or grant permission to operate a network
of broadcasting stations unless the applicant therefor is-

Then follow certain qualifications, to which
I shall refer later.
I call attention particularly to the words
"shall not grant permission to operate a
network". Does that not include the granting
of a licence to an individual station, as well
as to a network? Perhaps my friend would
be good enough to answer that question too.
The qualifications are:
(a) a Canadian citizen, or
(b) a corporation incorporated under the laws of
Canada or any province, the chairman or other
presiding officer and at least two-thirds of the
directors of which are Canadian citizens and at
least three-fourths of the shares of which (having
full voting rights under all circumstances) belong
to
(i) Canadian citizens, or
(ii) a corporation other than a corporation controlled directly or Indirectly by citizens or subjects of a country other than Canada.

I have listened with some interest to the
rather flattering remarks that have been made
about the old C.B.C. Board of Governors.
While I have no particular objection to those
remarks, I may cite an instance which carries
no such compliments to the board, and
perhaps not even to its chairman.
I think it was understood, whether by
regulation or by the act, that under the old

C.B.C. board it was intended that no one
person or corporation should operate more
than one television station. That rule was
violated. There were a number of cases where
one person or one corporation did operate
more than one television station.
Hon. Mr. Bruni: I recall such cases in the
radio field, but not in television.
Hon. Mr. Euler: In television as well.
Hon. Mr. Bruni: Has the honourable senator an example?
Hon. Mr. Euler: I was present at a meeting
in which that matter came up, and it never
was contradicted. But what I am more concerned with, after reading section 14, is that
it is the wish and desire that everyone
allowed to operate a station in Canada should
foster Canadian sentiments as opposed to,
I think, the fostering of American sentiment.
From that I would gather that where it was
possible to give Canadians the right to operate
a station as opposed to persons of another
country, the preference ought to be given to

Canadians. I have in mind an instance in
which there were two applicants, one of
which was a company, 50 per cent of whose
shares were owned by a corporation controlled in the United States-I need not
mention the name-and the other applicant
was a group of Canadians who were financially able and otherwise qualified to carry
on a truly Canadian television station. Arguments from both sides were heard by the
board, and almost the next day we were
informed that the licence was granted to the
company, a half-interest in which was con-

trolled by an American organization.
I come now to my expression of hope, that
when the new body is appointed that sort of
thing will no longer be permitted to take
place.
Hon. Mr. Bruni: Has the honourable senator
any solution to offer for dealing with the
problem that now exists? Are we going to
allow that American company to which he has
referred to continue to operate the station,
or, under section 14, are we going to compel
it to dispose of the station?
Hon. Mr. Euler: It is not for me to say
what should be done. I suppose you may
say the company has a vested interest in the
station; it was allowed to establish the station,
and perhaps should not now be penalized.
But my hope is that such will not happen
again.
Hon. Mr. Bruni: I think you can rest assured
that it will not.
Hon. L. M. Gouin: Honourable senators, I
should like to make a few remarks to express
my personal feelings about this bill, which on
the whole I consider is a good one. The
fundamental principle of having two separate

SENATE
entities is, I would say, almost the cornerstone of the Fowler report; and personallywhether I am right or wrong is, in a sense,
now a matter of indifference-I have always
been in favour of having both a regulating
board and also what I would call a grand
Canadian broadcasting system. The two fields,
in my opinion, are absolutely distinct, and I
do not share the misgivings of our dear
senator from Banff (Hon. Mr. Cameron) as to
the possibility of a conflict between those two
entities. By the way, the Board of Broadcast
Governors is not declared to be a corporation,
and personally I see no necessity that it should
be. Precautions have been taken to ensure
the impartiality of the governors. I believe the
remark was-quite properly-made by the
honourable senator from Gulf (Hon. Mr.
Power) that it is even more important that
these governors should not be pecuniarily
interested, and in section 3, subsection (6)
will be found the same text as that in section
22, subsection (5) relating to the Canadian
Broadcasting Corporation. My only criticism,
or question, which I do not expect to be
answered tonight, but which I should like to
ask in committee, is why-as provided in section 3-there are to be three full-time governors, namely, a Chairman, a Vice-Chairman,
and a third one whom I would call incognito,
and who is also a full-time member. It seems
to me that it would have been more logical
to give him a title, whatever it might be.
In the sarne section are provisions to the
effect that all these members of the board
hold their office, for the period stated, during
good behaviour; but there is a further provision, by subsection (7) that a member may
be removed at any time by the Governor
General on address of the Senate and House
of Commons. This, in my opinion, is quite
logical.
I come to the question of the networks.
To date the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation has had a monopoly of the national
network, but in view of section 13 it can
be said that we may now have a national
network, or a regional or provincial network
affiliated to the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, or, under subsection (5), a network
not affiliated to the Canadian Broadcasting
Corporation. I am not now in a position
to discuss the merits or demerits of that
proposition. Personally I am not married
to the idea of state-owned monopolies. I
prefer, whether for railways, radio or television, what I would call our mixed Canadian
system of having a state-owned corporation
along with private enterprise. Let me add
at once that the part to be played by the
Canadian Broadcasting Corporation is quite
different from that of a private broadcasting
station or system, which will naturally be
inclined to look after its commercial interest,

although I hasten to add that these private
stations have been quite generous to artists
and also-I speak from experience of the
stations in our province of Quebec-have
made remarkable contributions in the cultural field and have provided time, as a
public service, to various religious denominations.
I wish now to make one remark concerning what I would call the multiplicity or
seeming multiplicity of ministers who will
have something to do with the new measure.
Among them is the Minister of Transport,
who I understand already functions under
the Radio Act in respect of applications for
licences. I also note, in section 19, reference
to one whom I would call a rather mysterious
person, designated by the Governor in Council,
to whom the Board of Broadcast Governors
will report. Further, in Part 2, it seems that
the report of the corporation is to be made
to the Minister of Finance. At all events,
reports will be made to Parliament. And
here I would say, in parenthesis, that the
idea expressed by the honourable senator
from Banff (Hon. Mr. Cameron) concerning
a select committee to study the regulations
strikes me as excellent, and personally I
would be grateful to the honourable Leader
of the Government (Hon. Mr. Aseltine) if,
in due course, he would communicate the wish
of some of us that the suggestion for a select
committee be acted upon.
With regard to Part 2, may I state frankly
that I am puzzled by the words in section
22 "during pleasure" applied to the President
and the Vice-President of the Canadian
Broadcasting Corporation, whereas the other
directors are appointed to hold office "during
good behaviour".
These new methods of communication,
radio and television, which influence public
opinion, are called upon to play a more important part every day. Their role may be,
of course, either good, bad or indifferent. It
will be the duty of what I would call the
regulating board to try to give the Canadian
public as high a standard of radio and television programming as possible, not only with
respect to C.B.C. stations but also with
respect to privately-owned stations. Radio
and television influences the minds of our
Canadian citizens from the time of their
early childhood. The results may be absolutely wonderful if we are inspired by
Christian and patriotic ideals. Culture can be
dispensed almost like entertainment through
these modern mediums. Good use has already
been made of them but I would say that the
field open to them is almost limitless. We are
all proud of our country and we believe it is
essential that our broadcasting and television
system be truly and authentically Canadian.

AUGUST 28, 1958
(Translation):
Hon. Cyrille Vaillancouri: Honourable senators, I want to add just a few words to what
bas already been said. It is not a matter of
discussing each clause of the bill, but rather
of establishing a principle, of expressing an
idea. A few days ago someone came to my
office to talk about television. This person
was interested in television and his main
argument was that private television stations
should have priority over public stations, and
that, in the final analysis, it was a matter of
making money.
Then let us not be over-impressed or
blinded by those who claim that it is a matter of culture, or that some high principle is
involved, and that an effort is being made
to raise the minds and attitude of our
people.
I do not agree with that. The C.B.C. has
done a magnificent job from the cultural
point of view. The honourable senator from
Banff (Hon. Mr. Cameron) mentioned this
fact, as did the honourable senator who
spoke before me (Hon. Mr. Gouin). I believe
our radio and television systems are two
bodies which must contribute not only to the
entertainment-and much less to the cheapening of our people-but especially to their
culture and education.
Comparisons, it is said, are always invidious. But in the neighbouring country, where
radio and television are operated at a cost
of millions and hundreds of millions, if you
have the patience to sit through a whole
evening of American television you are an
extraordinarily patient man, because you
will not get more than fifteen minutes or
at most one hour of good television. I mention television because it has now taken the
lead over radio.
I hope the new board which is being
created will retain the spirit of the C.B.C.,
which must remain with us. If we were to
lose the C.B.C. the level of our programs
would go down and we would have cheap
broadcasts, brutal fighting which can in no
way elevate the mind of our youngsters. It
may be said that it is a monopoly, but if
it is a good one, let it be! We will need
several years more because culture and education cannot be acquired overnight. It may
take several years, but today television bas
come into all our homes, even where windows and doors are keut closed. And what
our children see today makes a deep impression upon their minds. So that if we provide
them with scenes of beauty and heroism, we
will inspire them with noble feelings rather
than degrading tendencies requiring no effort
whatsoever. Beyond the iron curtain the
people are making such cultural and educational efforts.

That is why, over there, twenty students
out of every thousand who leave public school
go on to university. What is the corresponding proportion here and in the United States?
In those countries, it is not a matter of being
faithful to an ideal, but simply a matter of
pride because they claim that they will one
day be in a position to dominate the world.
It seems to me that we, Latins, should have
a higher ideal. Tomorrow we should have
as high a standard of living as any other
country, but inspired with the spirit of charity
which we want to instil into our children, a
spirit of beauty, of nobility and of love. We
must all live in a spirit of charity and love.
I trust that, with the help of all, Canadian
radio broadcasting may yet become the best
in the world.
Last year some Americans who understood
French had come to see me at my home, and
they were looking at a French play given over
the C.B.C. television. When the play ended,
I turned to another network and my friend
said, upon seeing the American program:
"This is not the same thing; it is what we
get at home." I was very glad to hear him
say those words which meant: "Your television is much better than ours."
Let us strive towards that end, and may the
directors of radio and television direct our
thoughts towards nobility and greatness so
that in twenty years' time we may be proud
of them because they will have contributed
to the intellectual and cultural development
of our children.
Hon. Leon Methot: Honourable senators(Text):
The Hon. the Acting Speaker: May I remind honourable senators that if the honourable gentleman from Shawinigan (Hon. Mr.
Méthot) speaks now, his remarks will have
the effect of closing the debate.
(Translation):
Hon. Mr. Methot: Honourable senators, I
agree with everything the honourable senator
from Kennebec (Hon. Mr. Vaillancourt) has
just said and I am convinced that if we pass
this bill we will be helping those who will
direct, operate and control our C.B.C. as well
as all other radio and television broadcasting
and we shall thus contribute to the improvement which will result therefrom.
(Text):
Honourable senators, there will be two
bodies, the Board of Broadcast Governors
and the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation.
The corporation will be a Crown corporation,
as it is at present. If we cannot predict
the future, at least we can be guided by
experience. The set-up of the railways in
Canada has already met with success. We
have a Board of Transport Commissioners,
with which I would compare the Board of

SENATE

Broadcast Governors. They will be much
alike. As the honourable senator from Kennebec (Hon. Mr. Vaillancourt) said a moment
ago, the board will be independent, and it
will not have to make report of profit and
loss. Its duties and objects will be to see
that the act of the incorporation is complied
with.
Hon. Mr. Lamberi: May I ask my friend
if the Board of Broadcast Governors will be
in control of the budget of the corporation?
Hon. Mr. Méthot: Well, no, not in my own
opinion, but it will be able to regulate terms
and conditions of contract. It will have control of the corporation, and also of the
private networks or stations.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: Surely the Board of
Broadcast Governors would have something
to say-a great deal to say, I should thinkabout the expenditure of the $60 million that
is proposed for the capital development of
the C.B.C. this year?
Hon. Mr. Méthot: Well, the objects and
purposes of the board are expressed in sections 10 and 11. Section 10 says in part:
The board shall, for the purpose of ensuring the
continued existence and efficient operation of a
national broadcasting system...

And section 11 says:
The board may make regulations for carrying out
the purposes and provisions of this Part, and in
particular, but without restricting the generality
of the foregoing, may make regulations,
(a) respecting the minimum broadcasting times
to be reserved for network programs by any broadcasting station operating as part of a network;
(b) respecting standards of programs:
(c) respecting the character of advertising and
the amount of time that may be devoted to
advertising;
(d) respecting the proportion of time that may
be devoted to the broadcasting of programs, advertisements or announcements of a partisan political
character and the assignment of such time on an
equitable basis to all parties and rival candidates;
(e) for promoting and ensuring the greater use
of Canadian talent by broadcasting stations.

But it is the corporation, created by Part II
of the bill, which is to take charge of
national broadcasting. That may be one of
the reasons for the difference in the wording
of the bill as to appointment of officers.
The President and Vice-President are appointed during pleasure, but the other officers
are appointed to hold office during good behaviour for a certain length of time.
If we may again turn to the rallways, we
find that the President of the C.N.R. is
appointed to hold office during pleasure,
and I believe, although I may be wrong, that
he is appointed to hold office during pleasure
for three years. Nobody objects to that.
During the debate mention was made of
reporting to certain ministers. Section 37(1)

of the Canadian National Railways Act, which
was assented to on June 28, 1955, says:
The annual budget of National Railways shall
be under the control of the Board of Directors and
shall be submitted by the Board of Directors to
the Minister of Transport.

Subsection (2) reads as follows:
The Minister of Transport shall annually lay
before Parliament the budget of National Railways
approved by the Governor in Council on the recommendation of the Minister of Transport and the
Minister of Finance.

It will be seen, therefore, that only two
ministers are to report to Parliament, and
that is operating quite well.
Honourable senators, I think this bill will
have practically the same effect as the present
law, except that we will have two separate
bodies, and that the body which will be called
the Board of Broadcast Governors will, as the
honourable senator from Kennebec said a
little while ago, be more effective than the
present Board of Governors.
If this bill goes to committee, no doubt it
will be dealt with clause by clause.
Motion agreed to and bill read second time.

SOUTH SASKATCHEWAN RIVER
PROJECT
FEDERAL-PROVINCIAL
AGREEMENT-RESOLUTION OF APPROVAL-DEBATE ADJOURNED

Hon. W. M. Aseline moved, pursuant to
notice:
Resolved, That it is expedient that the Houses of
Parliament approve the agreement between the
Government of Canada and the Government of
Saskatchewan respecting the South Saskatchewan
River Project, signed on the 25th day of July,
1958, and that this bouse do approve the same.

He said: Honourable senators, it falls to my
lot as a senator from the province of Saskatchewan to have the privilege of introducing in this chamber this very important
motion. The purpose of the motion, of course,
is to secure the approval of the Senate of the
agreement dated July 25, 1958 made between
the Government of Canada and the Government of the Province of Saskatchewan. It bas
to do with an irrigation and agricultural rehabilitation project incorporating certain
hydro-electric power facilities, and it is known
to everyone under the name of the South
Saskatchewan River Project.
I would like to inform honourable senators
that the proposal to construct a dam for this
purpose has been talked about for a hundred
years. In 1858 Professor Hind, a geologist
and naturalist at Toronto, Ontario, was sent
out in charge of an expedition to explore the
Saskatchewan and Assiniboine Rivers. He reported back that a dam should be erected at
about the same site as is now proposed, that
is at Coteau Creek on the South Saskatchewan
River, but not for the same purpose. He was
more interested in navigation and diverting
the water of the South Saskatchewan down
the Qu'Appelle Valley and into the Assiniboine River, on down to Winnipeg where the
Assiniboine River flows into the Red. Since
then from time to time many men have studied
the problem and all have recommended that
a dam be built for irrigation and hydro
power.
As honourable senators know, the South
Saskatchewan River runs through the Palliser Triangle, the southwestern part of
which is quite dry. It rises in the Rocky
Mountains some distance west of Calgary and
flows east until it comes to Elbow, Saskatchewan. Then it makes a direct turn north past
Outlook, Saskatchewan, and on north where
it joins the North Saskatchewan River some
miles east of the city of Prince Albert.

SENATE
The agitation to have a dam built on the
South Saskatchewan River came to a head in
the 1930's. Honourable senators will remember those years, I am sure, and anyone who
lived in the Prairie provinces during that
period knows that water was very scarce.
The whole farm population of western Canada
suffered greatly on account of the fact that
crops were poor and feed was so scarce that
it had to be imported all the way from
Minnesota, Manitoba and other parts of the
Northwest.
As I have said, the agitation for a dam
came to a head in the 1930's. Since 1940,
particularly, much intensive engineering and
survey work has been done, and reports and
findings have been made. The greatest experts on earth dams on the continent have
been consulted, and the question of whether
or not this dam should be built, whether or
not it was a good thing, whether or not it
was in the national interest has been an
election issue in western Canada for the past
25 years.
The site of the dam is at Coteau Creek,
between Elbow and Outlook, Saskatchewan.
Ten other locations were looked into between
Swift Current and the city of Saskatoon before it was finally decided by the engineers
that the Coteau Creek site was the ideal
location for this dam. I want to reiterate that
the dam site was chosen after most careful
and thoughtful study of the whole problem.
When this dam on the South Saskatchewan
River is built it will form a lake 135 miles long
and from one to two miles wide. The lake
will contain 8 million acre feet of water. The
depth at the dam will be 175 feet to 190 feet.
If you compare that with the Seaway dam on
the St. Lawrence River, where the lake is
only 35 miles long and the depth between
27 and 40 feet, you will have a better idea of
the size of the reservoir which will be created
by this dam and of the magnitude of the
project. The reservoir will have a shore line
of 475 miles. In addition to supplying water
for irrigation and hydro-electric power, water
will be diverted into the Qu'Appelle valley
and be carried by gravity to supply Moose Jaw
and Regina with a permanent supply of good,
clear water. Of minor importance is the fact
that it may result in the formation of quite
a summer resort and public playground in
that part of Saskatchewan, where water is
scarce and where there are no lakes.
When the dam is built it will provide irrigation for 500,000 acres, it will serve 50,000
farmers, and it will make it possible to grow
feed and fodder, coarse grains, and that
kind of product when the West suffers a
drought or in a dry season. I have already
referred to the 1930's when the rainfall was

almost nil, crops failed to grow and feed for
stock had to be brought some thousands of
miles.
The site of this dam is close to an area
where a large population of farmers and
others live. Some 53 per cent of the people
of Saskatchewan reside within a radius of
125 miles of the dam site, of whom some
250,000 are in rural areas. Huge areas can
be irrigated by gravity, others can be irrigated by pumping, and the cheap hydroelectric power which is generated will furnish
the energy to drive the pumps.
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Otawa West): Would
the honourable senator know what portion of
the 500,000 acres will have to be served by
pumped water?
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: I may cover that point
in my remarks; if not, I will answer it later.
I should like to emphasize that since 1940
large herds of cattle have been built up in
the area about which I have been speaking.
irrigation will produce a permanent supply
of feed for this livestock.
I might also mention an irrigation project
in the province of Alberta. Incidentally, if the
honourable senator from Medicine Hat (Hon.
Mr. Gershaw) were in the chamber tonight,
I am sure he would want to speak in favour
of the agreement. The St. Mary's River projcet was built in Alberta under the Prairie
Farm Rehabilitation Act. It originally furnished water for 120,000 acres and is now
being extended to cover 380,000 acres.
The dam referred to in this resolution,
honourable senators, is of earth construction.
The main dam across the South Saskatchewan
River at Coteau Creek will be 205 feet high,
its crest length 8,500 feet, and its width at
base 2,600 feet; it will be riprapped on the
upper side with rock which can be obtained
in large quantities in the district. This dam
will carry a highway and a railway across
the river. The area to be flooded is 116,000
acres.
The second dam to be built will cross the
Qu'Appelle Valley about 11½ miles southeast
of Elbow. This is necessary to hold the
water from the reservoir from flowing down
the Qu'Appelle Valley in that direction: there
will be spillways at this dam and other works
of that nature through which the water will
flow by gravity down the Valley to Buffalo
Lake, which is the chief supplier of water
to the southern part of Saskatchewan, including the cities of Moose Jaw and Regina.
The dam will be 135 feet high and 6,700
feet long. These dams are to be of earth.
The best experts on the North American continent were called in for consultation, and

they agreed that earth construction such as him credit for that. I have known him a

province of Saskatchewan, provided that the
cost shall not exceed $100 million.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Is that the total cost?
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: No. The total estimated
cost of the dam and reservoir is $96 million,
including the cost of acquiring land, and so
on. The Province of Saskatchewan insisted
on a clause being put in the agreement to
the effect it would not have to pay more than
$25 million, and if the dam costs more than
$100 million the excess cost will be met by
the federal Government. In order to assist
Saskatchewan to finance its share of approximately $25 million, the federal Government will also pay 25 per cent of installing
the penstocks to develop 200,000 horsepower.
When the dam has been built and the power
bas been developed, the whole project will
be turned over and presented to the Province
of Saskatchewan.

Hon. Mr. Macdonald: What was the 25 per
cent for?
Hon. Mr. Aselline: Hydro-electric development.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Is there an estimated
cost of that?
Hon. Mr. Aselline: I believe I have some
figures on it. The estimated cost of the dam
and reservoir to be constructed is $96 million,
of which 75 per cent is to be paid by Canada
and 25 per cent by the Province of
Saskatchewan.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I was interested in
the cost of the hydro-electric development.

Hon. Mr. Hugessen: The cost of the penstocks, I suppose, will be included in the
$20 million estimated for power development,
to which my honourable friend referred?
Hon. Mr. Aselline: The hydro potential is
much greater than 200,000 horsepower, and if
Saskatchewan goes ahead and develops more
power then it will pay the full cost of that.
Hon. Mr. Baird: Do I understand rightly
that this whole project is to cost some $185
million and will benefit a total of 50,000
farmers?
Hon. Mr. Asel±ine: It will probably benefit
50,000 farms, which is quite a number in
any country.
Part II of the agreement bas to do with
operation and maintenance of the reservoir.
There is a clause in the agreement to the
effect that for 10 years after the transfer
of the project by Canada to the Province of
Saskatchewan, Canada will furnish all work,
labour and materials necessary for maintenance of the reservoir. The cost of
maintenance of the reservoir during the first
six years of the agreement will be borne
solely by Canada. For the next four years
Canada and Saskatchewan will share equally
the cost of maintaining the reservoir.
Clause 9(1) on page 8 of the agreement
provides that if a major disaster occurs to
the reservoir and it is attributable to faulty
design or construction, Canada will indemnify
the province in respect to claims by third
parties. A board, called the South Saskatchewan Reservoir Board, is set up, composed of
four members, two appointed by each
Government.

SENATE

Triangle, which embraces a great part of
Southern Saskatchewan, as well as portions
of Alberta and Manitoba, together with that
area in the States known as the dust bowl.
My memory goes back to the recurring
drought conditions in those nine years between 1929 and 1938 and I am interested in
anything that could possibly be done to ensure
relief.
From an economic standpoint, it is interesting to note that the income from wheat sales
alone for a period of years prior to 1929, in
the three Prairie provinces, amounted on
an average in excess of $350 million a year.
For the nine years of drought between 1929
and 1938 it amounted to an average of $165
million. The year 1931 was a particularly bad
year, when there was almost a complete crop
failure, and evidence which was received by
the Rowell-Sirois Commission indicated that
the income of wheat farmers dropped to an
average of $81 in cash a year. That is the
average amount the wheat farmer received
in cash at elevators, after leaving enough
for seed and enough feed on the farm. That
average figure is taken over an area embracing about 22,000 farmers. Of course, that
created a serious situation. In view of that
situation, in 1935 the Government of that
day brought in the Prairie Farm Rehabilitation Act, which set up an agency to cope
with drought problems and to study solutions. As a matter of custom in the past
20 years P.F.R.A., the initials of the act, have
become attached as a title to the agency or
bureau consisting of engineers and experts
of every kind who have been studying the
problem of drought conditions out there, and
possible solutions.
I spent a few days last July on the Prairies.
For the greater part of two days I was in the
air over southern Saskatchewan, that part
within the Palliser Triangle, and I found at
that time what I recognized as assurance
against a recurrence of what we had experienced back in the 1930's, and that was the
existence of a number of bodies of water,
reservoirs of every kind, covering that

country.
thousands of ponds on individual farms.
Larger reservoirs provided by damming up
the ravines and so on on the Prairies provided
a water supply for stock watering. I afterwards
visited some of the areas I knew very well
during the drought years and I found them
converted from the old economy of individual
farmers on every half-section to large community pastures surrounding these dam projects and reservoirs. Those areas had been
converted from what had been a wheat
economy during the drought years to a livestock economy, and that provided a solution
and assurance, to some extent, that drought

could not produce as disastrous results in the
same area as it did in the past.
I followed that up with a study of the
last annual report of the Prairie Farm
Rehabilitation Act and I was amazed to find
that during the 20 years it has been in
operation more than 53,000 water reservoirs
have been built over that area, 40-odd
thousand of them being on individual farms,
and many thousands on larger projects that
service neighbourhoods.
Then there were
areas like Vauxhall, Hayes, Rolling Hills, St.
Marys and other areas in the drought belt
that have been converted into irrigated
agricultural projects.
What I was particularly interested in was
the tremendous job that has been done under
the P.F.R.A. in the way of providing an
insurance. But a lot of individuals in that
area have forgotten the old conditions, or
are too young to have suffered from them,
and are inclined to think the oldtimers who
tell them of things that happened back in
the thirties are spoofing or talking of something they know nothing about.
I think the work done under the P.F.R.A.
has been a tremendous factor in avoiding a
recurrence of the old drought conditions. I
would hope that the facilities and the
services of that act which have been
developed during the years since the war
will be extended to every province. We had

been closed for some time and we are
tremendously interested in the Government
taking under consideration an expansion of
that work. I do not think there is any
more important factor in the problem of
land use throughout Canada than those to
which I refer. If the agency was not tagged
with a name including "Prairie", I have no
doubt its activities would have been further
extended before now.

I do earnestly hope

that the Government will give consideration
to a great expansion of the services that
have played such an important part in this
Palliser Triangle area and in the development leading up to this matter which we
have under consideration at the present
time. The act was set up for the Prairies
and it is named for the Prairies, but I do
not think the Prairie people would object if
the name was changed to "Canadian Reclamation Act" or something of that kind, which
would be more suitable than the present
name for an act applicable to all of Canada.
I think it would not only continue to play
a great part in the development of Saskatchewan and the Palliser Triangle but that in

the future it would assist reclamation and
rehabilitation in agricultural areas in other
provinces.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Honourable senators,
from the discussion which took place tonight
it would appear that there is a wish on
behaif of a number of senators that the
agreement should be considered in committee. I think the proper procedure would
be for me, or someone, to move adjournment

motion to refer the agreement for consideration to committee.

Hon. Mr. Macdonald: An honourable senator behind me suggests the Committee on
Natural Resources. However, it is immaterial.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: The Committee on
Transport and Communications will be meeting tomorrow morning.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: May I suggest that in
view of the tremendous financial implications
of this bill it should properly go before the

think this agreement, of which I have been

between the two Governments. The service,
however, is limited and does not normally
operate during the hours of darkness.
The Province of New Brunswick has
surveyed the area in conjunction with the
State of Maine and they jointly feel that the
ferry service should be replaced by a permanent bridge. In part, this decision is based
on the fact that there are no medical facilities
on Campobello Island and there have been
many cases where emergency trips have had
to be made under adverse and sometimes
dangerous conditions. Further, for the development of trade and tourism it is felt that the
existing ferry service is completely inadequate
and should be replaced by a permanent
structure.
The bill does not deal with financial
matters. It merely permits the Province of
New Brunswick to enter into an agreement
with the State of Maine, which agreement
would cover the financial arrangements and
the procedure for construction. This bill does,
however, provide that any such agreement is
subject to the approval of the Governor in
Council and also provides that construction
must be in accordance with and subject to the
regulations for safeguarding navigation. The
bill also provides that Canadian labour and
materials to the extent of approximately
50 per cent shall be employed in the construction of the bridge.
Arrangements for financing the construction
of the bridge and approaches would be, in the
first instance, a matter for agreement between
the Province of New Brunswick and the State
of Maine, which agreement will be permitted
by this legislation. It is proposed that the
design of the structure would be undertaken
by the State Highway Commission; however,
provision in the agreement would be made
that tenders would be called in both Maine
and New Brunswick.
As the proposed bridge would be built in
the area included in the Passamaquoddy Tidal
Development which is before the International
Joint Commission, confirmation has been
obtained from the commission that construction of a bridge at this location would not
interfere in any way with the proposals being
considered by the commission. Furthermore,
there would be no financial advantage in seeking to merge the proposed bridge with any of
the dam structures under consideration for
the power development project.
As this would be an international structure,
and in view of the fact that the federal Government now asumes 50 per cent of the ferry
subsidy, the Province of New Brunswick has
requested that the federal Government participate with the province in the Canadian
share of this structure. Should the necessary

legislation be enacted and a satisfactory agreement entered into between the State of Maine
and the Province of New Brunswick, the federal Government has agreed to share in the
cost of the project with the Province of New
Brunswick. The present proposal is that the
federal Government will bear two-thirds of
the cost of the Canadian half of the structure
and the New Brunswick approach and that
the province of New Brunswick would assume
one-third of the cost of the structure and
approach and, in addition, would assume
100 per cent responsibility for the construction of a connection from the highway system
to the bridge approach.
On the basis of preliminary estimates, the
Canadian share of the project would be
$580,000 and funds for federal participation
would be dealt with under the estimates of
the Department of Public Works.
An analysis of the bill is as follows:
Section 1 is short titie.
Section 2 authorizes the construction, operation and maintenance of the bridge subject
to the provisions of the act and subject to
the terms of the agreement concluded between the Province of New Brunswick and
the State of Maine as provided by the Governor in Council.
Section 3 authorizes the Province of New
Brunswick to enter into an agreement with
the State of Maine. In several recent instances the agreement has been in existence
before the legislation was introduced and
accordingly it bas been possible to attach a
copy of the agreement to the bill. However,
in the present instance the agreement has not
yet been worked out in detail. In order that
the construction of the bridge may not be
unduly delayed, provision is made in the bill
for the submission of the agreement when
made to the Governor in Council for approval. If this clause were not included, it
would amount to asking Parliament to sign
a blank cheque. Section 3 also specifiies that
the bridge is to be free of tolls.
Section 4 requires the bridge shall be constructed in accordance with the regulations
for the safeguarding of navigation. This, in
fact, is a requirement of the Navigable Waters
Protection Act, which is administered by the
Department of Public Works of Canada.
Section 5 requires that Canadian labour
and materials are to be used to the extent of
50 per cent where these are available in
Canada. The decision whether this provision
of the bill has been complied with lies with
the Minister of Labour.
Section 6 is a routine requirement that
Canadian labour shall be employed in accordance with the Fair Wages and Hours of
Labour Act.

American Revolution. Following the migration of the Loyalists to Canada, these islands
received their first permanent settlers and
they have been part and parcel of our Canadian territory ever since. It was at the mouth
of the St. Croix River, where it enters
into Passamaquoddy Bay, that DeMont and
Champlain spent a winter in an attempt to
establish a settlement there some four years
before Quebec was founded.
These islands played an important part in
the war of 1812 and in the war of the American Revolution. It was in this vicinity that
John Allan, a member of the Nova Scotia
Assembly, and a sympathizer with the
rebellious American colonists, established his
headquarters during the Eddy Rebellion in
an effort to make Nova Scotia the fourteenth
rebellious colony.
In years past the people of these islands
have suffered from isolation, which is the
lot of most island communities. They have
maintained their cultural and economic contact by the use of boats and a ferry service
to the New Brunswick mainland. It is only
reasonable to assume that the residents of
Deer Island will expect the same communication with the mainland as is now proposed
for Campobello. I suggest that the Canadian
Government look into this matter and investigate ways and means of connecting
Campobello and Deer Island to the New
Brunswick mainland at L'Etete.
Communities which have suffered so
long, and which have been a part of our
Canadian way of life and contributed so
much to the welfare of our fishing industry,
often at great disadvantage to themselves,
should share in all that Canada has to offer.
I understand that some four years ago the
federal Department of Public Works was
ready to undertake the construction of a
similar bridge at this location, if and when
the New Brunswick Government would give
its approval and co-operation. Announcement of approval from New Brunswick did
not come until late in March of this year.
Now that the Government has taken the
initial step to connect this Passamaquoddy
island with the mainland, it must consider
plans of linking Campobella and its sister
island to the Canadian mainland. This may
be impossible; it certainly would be most difficult, because the tides are high and powerful between the small islands that lie
between Deer Island and the mainland.
Now that the Government has taken the
first step, it must be prepared to take a
second look at the problem of the residents
of these islands and their place in Canadian
history, for their place in New Brunswick's
economy requires this consideration.

I think we are entitled to more information obtained from engineering reports concerning the conditions to be met in the construction of this bridge. Failure to provide
this could easily prejudice any wider policy
in establishing connections between these
islands and the mainland of New Brunswick.
Honourable senators, this is the first time
that we have heard about this matter of
connecting these Passamaquoddy Islands to
the mainland, but it will not be the last.
Motion agreed to and bill read second time.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, when shall this bill be read the third
time?
Hon. Mr. McGrand: Next sitting.
JUDGES BILL
SECOND READING
Hon. William R. Bruni moved the second

reading of bill C-59, to amend the Judges
Act.
He said: Honourable senators, this bill is
a very short one, and requires only a brief
explanation. However, I think it is an
important bill, and when it becomes law it
will greatly facilitate the administration of
justice in the provinces of New Brunswick
and Ontario.
The provinces of New Brunswick and
Ontario have passed and proclaimed legislation which provides for certain additional
judicial positions, and the amendments proposed to the Judges Act are required in
order to effect these new positions.
Honourable senators are aware that by
section 92, clause 14, of the British North
America Act the provinces have jurisdiction
over the constitution of courts within the
provinces. Section 96 of the same act makes
provision for the appointment of judges
of the Superior, District and County Courts
in each province by the federal Government,
and section 100 of the act charges the federal
Government with payment of the salaries,
allowances and pensions of such judges.
With that brief explanation, I will now
deal briefly with the three clauses of the bill.
Clause 1 specifies that there shall be 20
other judges of the high court of Ontario
besides the Chief Justice. Under the present
act there are 18 other judges. The appointment of two additional judges wili greatly
facilitate the work of the High Court in
Ontario. These judges are really needed in
this province since it has been found, with
the great increase in litigation which has
taken place in the province of Ontario, that
18 judges are not sufficient to do all the
work properly.
Clause 2 specifies that there shall be
three other judges of the Appeal Division of

SEPTEMB ER 1, 1958
the Supreme Court of New Brunswick besides
the Chief Justice. At present there are two
other judges. As is stated in the explanatory
notes to this bill, the Legislature of New
Brunswick has amended the New Brunswick
Judicature Act to provide an additional
office, with the intention that the judge would
act primarily as Judge of the Court of
Divorce and Matrimonial Causes but would
be available for the Appeal Division when
required, particularly in appeals from the
Chancery Division.
Further, subsection (2) of clause 2 repeals
the provision of the present act which provides an extra salary of $500 for the Judge
of the Court of Divorce and Matrimonial
Causes. In view of the new arrangement that
I have outlined, this salary would not be
required.
Finally, clause 3 of the bill specifies that
there shall be 70 judges and junior judges of
the County and District Courts of Ontario.
At present there are 64 such judges. I am
informed that these six additional judges will
be located as follows: District No. 2-One
extra judge in the county of Essex, which
embraces
Essex,
Windsor,
Leamington,
Kingsville and other places. District No. 1One extra judge, who will preside in the
counties of Lincoln, Welland and Wentworth,
so that he will be available to relieve the
judges in Hamilton and Welland, where there
is considerable work at the present time,
including, I understand, quite a number of
untried cases.
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): Where
will the judges live?
Hon. Mr. Bruni: I do not think that has
been decided. Of course, if you leave it up
to the appointee it will be in Hamilton.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: But which county?
Hon. Mr. Bruni: My understanding is that
he will be appointed for Wentworth county.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: There is no provision
in the bill before us for any one of these
judges being appointed to any particular
county or district?
Hon. Mr. Bruni: That is right. I am just
giving this as additional information which I
thought might be of interest to honourable
senators.
It is proposed to have the third judge
appointed for the County of Simcoe which
embraces the towns of Orillia, Barrie, Coldwater and Penetanguishene.
The next two appointments, I understand,
are to go to the County of York, in which the
City of Toronto is located. From personal
experience I can assure honourable senators

741

that two additional judges are certainly
required in the County Court of the County
of York.
Finally, I think it is the intention to appoint
an extra judge for the Sudbury district.
As I have stated, the provinces affected by
this bill have passed and proclaimed legislation establishing these additional offices, which
they were competent to do under the British
North America Act.
The Attorneys General for the provinces of
Ontario and New Brunswick have requested
the federal Government to enact these amendments to provide the salaries in order that
the appointments may be made to the offices.
I am advised that the Minister of Justice has
had discussions and correspondence with the
Attorneys General of the two provinces with
a view to establishing that these additional
judges are required, and he is satisfied that
the judges are required.
I would therefore recommend this bill to
honourable senators for favourable consideration.
Hon. W. Ross Macdonald: Honourable senators, I am in accord with the provisions of
the bill in so far as I am acquainted with the
needs of the country. I am acquainted with
the necessity of having additional judges on
the High Court Division of the Supreme
Court of Ontario and also additional judges
for the County Courts of Ontario.
I am not familiar with the requirements
for the province of New Brunswick, but if the
Legislature of that province has requested the
appointments provided for in this bill I have
no hesitation in approving of them.
As the sponsor of the bill has stated, the
work in the High Court Division, which is
the Trial Division, of the Supreme Court of
Ontario is very heavy indeed. It bas been
increasing rapidly over the years, and 18
judges have not been able to keep the work
up to date. It is desirable that the cases which
are entered in the courts should be disposed
of as soon as they are prepared for trial.
Two additional judges will help to dispose
of the cases, but even with 20 judges I think
the courts will be kept very busy and that
all the cases will not be disposed of at the
end of the season.
With respect to the County Courts, as
honourable senators know, there are in
Ontario-and probably in other provinces
and districts throughout the dominion-certain counties in which the work is very light
and can be attended to within several hours
each week. That does apply particularly to
some counties in Ontario. There are other
counties where the work is very heavy, where
judges are required to be in their office and
in the courts at least five days every week,
and even six days.

SENATE
I am pleased ta notice that the Ontario
Legislature at its recent session established
these additional offices with jurisdiction
throughout the province. I presume that these
six additional judges will be allotted ta six
additional offices, but we have no assurance
of that. The bill merely provides for the appointment of six additional County Court
judges, and the Legislature could appoint
them to one county. Is there anything to
prevent that?
Hon. Mr. Bruni: The appointments have
to be made by the dominion Government.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Yes, the appointments
have to be made by the dominion Government.
I think, though, we should have some information as to what counties these judges
will be appointed to.
Hon. Mr. Bruni: Possibly a little disagreement has arisen in connection with these
appointments. I believe that it is the feeling
of tfle dominion Government that every
County Court Judge should be named for
a specific county. The Ontario Act provides
that six additional judges shall be appointed
in the province, which would lead one to
believe that they would have jurisdiction in
all the county courts of Ontario. My own
feeling is that they will be named to specific
counties, but of course I have no authority
to say that this will be done. I have expressed
an opinion tonight as to where I think they
will be named, and that is as far as I can go.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Well, I think we accept the statement made by the honourable
senator sponsoring the bill. I am satisfied
that in at least six counties there is need
of an additional judge, and as the Legislature
of Ontario has asked for six appointments
I am prepared to support the request.
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): Can the
honourable gentleman who sponsored the bill
tell us if the Ontario Legislature indicated
where these judges are required? Is it his
information that they will probably be appointed to districts selected by the Attorney
General of Ontario or the Legislature of Ontario?
Hon. Mr. Bruni: I do not think the legislators for the province of Ontario were advised of the counties to which the judges
would be named, because when the act was
passed in the Legislature it was of such a
type that it proposed to give jurisdiction to
each of these six judges in every County
Court in the province of Ontario.
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Otawa Wesi): That is
very unusual.
Hon. Mr. Bruni: That is a very unusual
feature. But I still think the judges are

going to be named to specific counties and
that those counties will be agreed upon at
a conference between the Attorney General of
Ontario and the Minister of Justice of Canada, and I think they will be appointed to
the counties that I have mentioned tonight.
I believe that has almost finally been agreed
upon.
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa Wesi): As the
honourable gentleman knows, as a matter of
practice very often a County Court judge in
one county who does not happen to be too
busy is frequently seconded to the County
Court in the adjoining or nearby county to
assist in disposing of the work there, but
I think-I speak subject to correction-there
has never been an appointment of a County
Court judge at large in Ontario.
Hon. Mr. Bruni: There never has been. As
a matter of fact, there are in Ontario 12
judicial districts, each made up of a number
of counties or districts, and the judges do
rotate within those judicial districts. Occasionally a judge from outside the district will
come into Toronto, where the work on the
County Court list gets far behind; no limitation is placed on York county in taking judges
from outside the district.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Has the act of the
Ontario legislature been proclaimed?
Hon. Mr. Bruni: I understand it has.
Hon. Mr. Burchill: Honourable senators, on
behalf of New Brunswick may I add one word
to what has been said. I think I am correct
in saying that in addition to an enactment by
the Legislature and a recommendation by the
Attorney General of our province, there was
also a recommendation from the Barristers'
Society of New Brunswick for the appointment of an extra judge. Of course, every
lawyer in this chamber tonight realizes that
a recommendation from the Barristers' Society is almost tantamount to a guarantee that
an appointment will be made.
Hon. Mr. Bruni: Absolutely.
Hon. W. Ross Macdonald: Honourable senators, this bill will no doubt receive second
reading tonight. I would suggest that before
it receives third reading its sponsor should
get more information with respect to the
Ontario counties to which the new judges will
be appointed. It seems to me rather unusual
for the Government to ask Parliament for the
appointment of certain judges for the province
and leave it to the Minister of Justice to
decide to what counties they will be appointed.
Hon. Mr. Bruni: He always does that.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald:

SPECIAL

APPROPRIATION

BILL, 1958

FIRST READING

The Hon. the Speaker informed the Senate that a message had been received from
the House of Commons with Bill C-57, for
approving certain expenditures authorized
for the public service, and the application of
certain amounts in the accounts, of the
financial year ended the 31st March, 1958.
Bill read first time.
SECOND READING

The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, when shall this bill be read the second
time?
Hon. W. M. Aseltine: I move that the bill
be read the second time now.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Have copies of the
bill been distributed?
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Yes.
Honourable senators, this bill covers the
final supply for the fiscal year 1957-58. Its
purposes are to approve the supply released
by means of three special warrants of the
Governor General issued on August 16, 1957,
August 19, 1957, and February 7, 1958, and
to authorize the application in the accounts
for 1957-58 of the eleven items which were
included in the estimates for that year but
were not released by the warrants.
Perhaps I might give a brief explanation
of at least two of these eleven items, which
total $110,042,595. This figure may be found
in column 4, on page 69 of the Report on
Supply for the fiscal year ended March 31,
1958, a copy of which every honourable
senator has received. Two quite large items
are included in this total. The first one is
$103 million, which was used to make up
the deficit in the Old Age Security fund; the
Minister loaned the $103 million under the
Old Age Security Act and it is now being
repaid by this appropriation.
The other
large item is $6 million, which was used
for agricultural support. That makes $109
million out of the $110 million that I have
referred to. The other items are much
smaller, and I can give information with
regard to them if desired.
The amount of this bill is $657,060,927.32.
How this amount is determined is explained

in the summary that I have referred to. It
is on page 2 of the Report on Supply for the
fiscal year ended March 31, 1958, which
booklet was distributed to honourable senators last week.
First, to the amounts to be voted-that
is, excluding the statutory items-in the five
sets of estimates tabled last year are added
the amounts of two special warrants of
the Governor General issued last August,
one of which authorized further expenditures
on the movement of Hungarian refugees and
other immigrants to this country, and the
other authorized further payments under the
War Veterans Allowance Assistance Fund.
The first warrant, of August 16, 1957, was
for $300,000. The second warrant, of August
19, 1957 was for $2,428,000, which was used,
as I have said, for the transportation of
immigrants.
The other amount represents the difference
between the estimated and actual requirements for three of the eleven new items.
Next are shown reductions, largely made
by the Governor in Council, in those estimates. The sum of those is the total supply
for 1957-58, amounting to $3,541,314,359. From
this total requirement is deducted the amount
voted on account of the said items by the
six interim supply bills passed by Parliament
last year, $2,884,253,431.68. The balance of
$657,060,927.32 is the amount of the final supply bill now before us.
The footnote at the bottom of the first page
of the summary in the Report on Supply
gives a breakdown of this amount as follows:
(a) Total of amounts authorized by
three Special Governor General's
Warrants .........................
(b) Total of eleven items to be
authorized .......................

$547,018,332.32
110,042,595.00
$657,060,927.32

Honourable senators, I would like to say
a few words on the details of the third and
following pages of the Report on Supply.
The first column gives a breakdown of the
total amount to be voted in the Estimates
for 1957-58, less the statutory items. The
second column shows the total amount appropriated for each item in the six Appropriation Acts passed last year. The third
column gives the total amount released by
the three special warrants for each item. The
fourth column contains the eleven items to
be authorized by this bill, which I have
mentioned several times already. The fifth
column shows by item the total supply required for 1957-58. The last column lists the
reductions which, except where otherwise indicated, were effected by the Governor in
Council and represents the amounts which
were not urgently required for the 1957-58
year, and therefore were not included. In

SEPTEMBER 2, 1958
addition to the reductions effected by the
Governor in Council, the last column includes
five items for which increases are shown.
Three of these items-item 785 on page 7,
item 803 on page 22, and item 820 on page
35-represent differences between the estimated amounts included in the tabled estimates and the actual amounts reported in
the accounts concerned on March 31 last.
The other two increases are item 71, page
9, and item 508, page 61, which are the
amounts of the two special warrants issued
last August.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: What was the number of the item on page 9?
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: When I mention page
numbers I am referring to pages in the
Report on Supply, not in the bill. The bill
contains the total estimates for the whole
year; the report is an explanation of those
items.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: But you referred to
a number on page 9.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: Number 71.
Hon. Mr. Burchill: What is the number of
the original supply bill?
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: C-57.
Hon. Mr. Burchill: That is the bill we received today. But what is the number of the
one you are referring to?
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: This is not a bill; this
is the Report on Supply, which was distributed some time ago to honourable senators.
Hon. Mr. Burchill: We have not that here
today.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: Then it is in your office.
I will try to give honourable senators a
brief explanation of the bill. My references
have been to the Report on Supply, not to the
bill itself, but I notice that honourable senators have been looking at the bill and therefore they may not have understood some of
my remarks. I will do my best to answer any
questions on this matter.
Hon. W. Ross Macdonald: Honourable senators, this afternoon we are dealing with
history. Al moneys referred to in the bill
before us have already been spent; they were
disbursed during the fiscal year which commenced April 1, 1957 and terminated on March
31, 1958. Honourable senators will recall that
Parliament met on October 14, 1957 and was
dissolved at the end of January this year,
and at that time supply had not been provided. The election came along, and the Government spent the money shown here, some
$657 million. Now the Government comes
57075-4--48

along and wants us to approve the expenditure. Well, if we don't approve it, what
happens? If we do approve it, what happens?
Nothing, in any event.
I suppose that by this method, the Government is accounting to Parliament for its past
actions, but it is asking quite a lot to require
us to approve everything that has been done.
Here we are in the dying days of this session.
This supply was not considered in the House
of Commons. As a matter of fact it is quite
different from the supply bill which, we hope,
will be before us within the next few days.
The supply to be voted in that bill has been
under consideration in the other house since
it met in May of this year, and we are, or
should be, familiar with the items. But what
do we know about the contents of Bill C-57?
It is true that the Government has issued a
booklet entitled Report on Supply for the
fiscal year ended March 31, 1958. This report
came to my desk, I believe, in the early part
of last week. There has been very little opportunity, of course, to study it. Even if we
did study it we would get only the information
that is contained in the booklet itself. That
is quite different from what will be contained
in the supply bill that will come to us within
the next two or three days. Those estimates
were laid on the Table of this house months
ago and we have been able to study them,
and we have also been able to follow what
has taken place in the House of Commons.
So we have some knowledge of what those
estimates contain and what the supply bill
will contain. However, we know very little
concerning the bill now before us and, frankly,
I am in a quandary to know what to do about
it. Certainly if the bill carries in this house
it will be on division. I do not want it to be
said that I for one approve everything that
is being done. I certainly do not approve of
the method taken by the Government.
This is not to be taken as an instance of
sour grapes, but I don't think it was necessary to call an election for March 31. The
results probably would have been the same
if the election had been called for, say, May
31, and Parliament could have sat during
February and March and given consideration
to the estimates and the supply bill. We would
have known then what we were voting for,
but al we know now is that the Government
spent this huge sum of money in February
and March by Governor General's warrants
and now hands us this statement of expenditures and asks us to approve them. In my
opinion this is not the way to carry on the
business of this country. Some honourable
senators may point out that there was an
election in 1940, at which time Governor
General's warrants were issued, but I would
remind the house that on that occasion supply

SENATE

746

had been granted for the fiscal year 1939-40.
Any Governor General's warrants issued were
isued only between the date of the election
and the date when Parliament reassembled.
I doubt if there is another instanceHon. Mr. Aselline: Is the honourable Leader
of the Opposition referring to the election of
1939, when we sat only one day?
Hon. Mr. Lamberi: The election of 1940.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: The election was not
held in 1939, but in 1940. That is the election to which I am referring, and I say there
were no Governor General's warrants issued
during the election period. It was necessary
to have an election that winter, because we
were at war and hostilities had not reached
the intensity they were expected to reach
within a few months. Throughout the country at that time there was a great demand for
an election, but this year there was no such
demand and we should have passed these
estimates before an election was called. However, that was not done and now this statement is given to us and we are asked to
approve of these expenditures. I must say I
cannot approve of them and if the bill does
pass it will pass on division.

is a good comparison. There you are dealing with hundreds of dollars whereas here
we are dealing with millions.
There is one provision in the act which
the Leader of the Government did not mention, namely, that if at the beginning of any
fiscal year more than $2 million is in the
fund and not allotted, the annual credit of
$5 million must be reduced by the amount
by which the surplus in the fund exceeds $2
million. But the bill provides in subclause
3, paragraph 5, that an uncommitted balance
in excess of $2 million will not be a bar to
the granting of $5 million annually to the
fund. So in future there can be $7 million
or more in the fund when the grant of $5
million is made.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: I think perhaps the
honourable Leader of the Opposition is wrong
in the conclusion he comes to on that section.
Let me read the explanatory note:
The purpose of subelause (3) Is to abolish the

steam engines. I think if it is necessary to
have markings on a freight car it is equally
necessary to have them on a diesel or steam
engine, and I would like to know the reason
why no provision is made for them.
Honourable senators, in closing I will say
only that I note there is an increase in the
amounts appropriated for level crossings and
grade separations. I repeat what I said in
my opening remarks, that anything we can
do to protect the lives of those who travel
on our highways, should be done, and the
amount appropriated by this bill is not too
much to bring about that end.
Hon. T. A. Crerar: Honourable senators,
may I ask the honourable Leader of the
Government where this bright idea of reflective markings originated? Have the railway companies asked for them or has the
Board of Transport Commissioners recommended them? Where did the idea come
from?

SENATE

Hon. Mr. Crerar: Of course, honourable
senators, that is better than no answer at
all. But I doubt very much if this scheme
will have any very great effect in lessening
the number of accidents that take place. That
is why I would expect that before the Government embarked on this legislation it would
at any rate have conducted some kind of
inquiry or have had some good reason to
present to the bouse for the proposal. I am
bound to say that the honourable leader, in
his explanatory remarks on the bill, gave
us no clue whatever on that particular point.
It is well known that these deplorable
accidents take place. Quite a number of
years ago there was attached to a train on
which I was travelling to Winnipeg a special
car carrying the Board of Transport Commissioners on their way to western Canada.
I knew these gentlemen, and they kindly
asked me into their car and provided me
with a meal, to which I did not object. We
got into a discussion of railway problems,
and the question of accidents and the remarkable manner in which they occur came
up. I was told on that occasion-and my
recollection of it is very vivid-that accidents frequently happen in broad daylight,
that when the sunshine of heaven is bathing
the earth a motorist will come along to a
railway crossing and drive right into a train.
Now, that motorist is not blind. What is
the explanation for such an accident? What
is the explanation for the multitude of motor
accidents we now have? We have advanced,
and in doing so have brought forth all sorts
of suggestions as to how these deplorable
accidents may be avoided; but in this instance I am bound to say that in my judgment this measure-I have had only a
moment or two to consider it-will not prove
very effective in fulfilling its purpose. Nevertheless, I do think we should know whether
or not there has been a study back of this
recommendation. What is the genesis of this
idea? Is it simply that some person, somewhere, thinks ho has an idea which may
work, and the spending of a few million
dollars does not amount to very much? I do
not approve that method of procedure, and
I hope very much that on third reading, or
in committee-if this bill goes to committee
-some further light will be thrown on the
point I have just put forward.
Hon. A. K. Hugessen: Honourable senators,
I agree with the honourable senator from
Churchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar) that it would
be interesting, when the bill comes up for
third reading, to have some information as
to the genesis of this idea, but I cannot concur in his suggestion that the idea will not
be of any great use. It seems to me that there
has been a good deal of experience of modern

road construction and road signs which leads
to the conclusion that at night time a flashing
light of some kind, appearing in front of the
motorist, causes him to realize that there is
something ahead of him of which he must
take heed. I assume that these reflective
markings on the sides of railway cars will
perform a purpose somewhat similar to that
which is served by luminous fences at abrupt
turnings which the motorist picks out before
he gets there. This may be a valuable way
of reducing the number of fatalities through
accidents at railway grade crossings although
of course we must agree with the honourable
senator from Churchill that there is the odd
fool who will run into anything at any time
of day and under any conditions whatever.
For him we cannot legislate nor hope to
legislate.
With regard to the question raised by my
honourable leader (Hon. Mr. Macdonald) as
to why protective markings should not be
applied to the sides of diesels or steam locomotives, of course there is a great deal more
to attract the attention of an approaching
motorist when he is confronted with a diesel
engine or a steam engine. In the case of a
steam engine there is steam, in the case of
both engines there is a good deal of noise and
probably a certain amount of motion. The
real danger, it seems to me, arises where there
is a stationary freight car over a crossinga freight car which, perhaps, has not been
repainted for many years and therefore, on
a dark night, is pretty nearly impossible for
But it
the approaching motorist to sec.
seems to me that a diesel engine or a steam
engine is something which normally the
motorist can quite easily pick up with his
headlights.
One point which occurs to me is that if
reflective marks are to be placed on all freight
cars, all the work should be done pretty
much at the same time; and that is the reason
why provision is made in the bill for an
increased contribution by the Government in
the first three years. It would be very
dangerous to have some cars bearing these
reflective marks and others without them,
because in that event a motorist would never
know when he came to a railway intersection
whether he would be warned of the presence
of a freight car or whether he would not.
So, if this work is to be done, let it be done
as quickly as possible, so that, for the future,
the motorist using a highway at a level crossing will know that he is protected and will
be on the lookout and recognize these flashing
reflective markings on freight cars when he
approaches the level crossing.

FEDERAL-PROVINCIAL AGREEMENT APPROVED
Hon. W. M. Aseltine: Honourable senators,
on Monday evening last the honourable Leader
of the Opposition (Hon. Mr. Macdonald) moved
adjournment of the debate on my motion for
approval of this agreement between the
Government of Canada and the Government
of Saskatchewan, and the order for resuming
the debate is No. 3 on the Orders of the Day.
I would suggest, with the concurrence of
the Senate, that this Order be proceeded with
now and that when we have disposed of it
we revert to the earlier orders of business.
Hon. Senators: Agreed.
The Senate resumed from Monday, September 1, the adjourned debate on the motion
of Hon. Mr. Aseltine:
Resolved, That it is expedient that the Houses of
Parliament approve the agreement between the
Government of Canada and the Government of
Saskatchewan respecting the South Saskatchewan
River Project, signed on the 25th day of July, 1958,
and that this house do approve the same.
Hon. W. Ross Macdonald: Honourable senators, last evening the Committee on Banking
and Commerce considered this agreement.
Present at the meeting was the Minister of
Agriculture. I am sorry that the evidence
was not taken down by shorthand. I do not
know the reason, because I arrived a little
late; however it was not done, so that is an
end of it. Much valuable information was
given to the committee, information which
could not have been obtained in this house,
either while in session as we are now or
sitting as a Committee of the Whole. The
committee discussed the agreement, not clause
by clause, but fully, and I must say that the
minister was very forthright in his replies.
He did not hesitate to answer any question
which was asked of him, and I felt it was his
desire that the committee should have all the
details in connection with the agreement. I
think it was an excellent move to have sent
the agreement to committee, where it could
be studied, as it was.

I have very little to say about the agreement. It was entered into by the Dominion
Government and the Province of Saskatchewan. Many of us have considerable misgivings as to the advisability of doing al
this work at a vast and unknown expense;
I say "unknown" because we have no definite
figures. Various estimates have been made.
For instance, in 1952 it was estimated in
the Hogg report that for only the main reservoir and dam $129 million would be required.
In 1957 the Department of Defence Construction set a figure of $125 million; and in
1953 a private corporation made an estimate
of $88 million. Last night in committee
we were advised by the minister that the
P.F.R.A. administration compiled the figures
on which the Government is now working.
Someone asked what qualifications the P.F.R.A.
administration had for making an estimate,
and the minister replied that this is the
only organization which has built a dam of
the type proposed, so I suppose we can accept
the figures for which it is responsible. The
P.F.R.A. estimate is: for the dam and the
reservoir, $96 million; for the power plant,
between $24 million and $41 million-quite
a wide spread; for irrigation works, from
$35 million to $45 million; and for engineering
costs, $7.5 million. If we accept the lesser
figures I have mentioned in connection with
the power plant and the irrigation works,
the total sum amounts to $162.5 million.
Honourable senators, I was not at all convinced that this would be the final cost.
I don't think other honourable senators were
either. I am not sure the minister himself
is satisfied that the final cost might not be
a considerable number of millions of dollars
beyond this figure. We asked the minister
what crops are likely to be raised on this
irrigated land. He gave us figures as to
the cost per acre of the land to be irrigated,
depending on the level of the land in relation
to the dam, and apparently in some instances
the cost will be quite high. I am not going
to go into this at the present time.
The minister also told us, as we heard
in the house Monday night, that if there is
a failure in the structure of the reservoir
which is attributable to faulty design or construction, as a result of which damage is
caused in the magnitude of a disaster, the
federal Government will indemnify the province in respect to ail claims by third parties.
As I said a moment ago, we asked the
minister about the crops that might be
grown in this area, and if I remember correctly he predicted that sugar beets and sunflowers could be grown.
In addition I
suppose there would be vegetables and some
coarse grains.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: And fodder crops.

SENATE

Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Yes. Certainly it is
not intended to use this irrigated land for
the growing of wheat, so we are spending
all this money to construct the dam, although
the final results from an agricultural point
of view are most uncertain. I do agree that
considerable hydro-electric power will be
generated, which will be helpful to the district; but, generally speaking, this is a provincial matter. It is true that the Government has given some assistance to the province of New Brunswick in this respect, but
we have always considered the generating
of hydro-electric power to be a matter within
provincial jurisdiction.
Hon. Mr. Dupuis: Could the honourable
Leader of the Opposition (Hon. Mr. Macdonald) inform us as to the number of acres
that will be covered by water when the dam
has been constructed?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I have not got those
figures, but I believe the minister gave them
last night.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: I gave them in my
speech here on Monday.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I understand that
when the dam is built it will provide irrigation for 500,000 acres and that some 50,000
farms will benefit from it. It is a major
project and perhaps in 10 years' time we
shall know whether or not it has been worth
while. The agreement has been entered
into and I feel that it should be approved by
this house, especially in view of the fact that
no one seems to be strongly opposed to it.
I notice from reading the reports of the
proceedings of the other house that every
member there voted for the agreement, and
I would recommend that it receive the favourable consideration of this house.
Hon. R. B. Horner: Honourable senators,
I wish to say a few words on this occasion.
Saskatchewan has been asking for this
project for a great number of years. I would
point out to honourable senators who have
been spending the summer in Ottawa that
the rainfall in the month of July in the
Ottawa Valley was some nine inches, and
in August it was some five inches. By contrast, in a great part of the province of
Saskatchewan we are delighted with a rainfall of six inches from seed-time to harvest,
that is, during the months of April, May,
June, July and August.
With regard to the dam under discussion, I
do not intend to argue about the cost, for
many projects nowadays exceed their anticipated cost. Saskatchewan was threatened
with a great drought this year, but the catastrophe was overcome by one good rain. However, that is not the big question to be dealt

with now. The great problem facing us is
the shipping of feed long distances. In the
average year the province of Saskatchewan
is ideal for the raising of livestock, but dry
periods do occur when there is not sufficient
fodder. Entire herds of cattle, which perhaps
have been raised at great expense, have had
to be dispersed for lack of feed.
The honourable Leader of the Opposition
(Hon. Mr. Macdonald) asked what crops
could be grown in Saskatchewan. Certainly
I would not suggest that wheat is one of the
grains that will survive best under dry farming conditions. I am told that in Alberta and
Manitoba there is probably sufficient acreage
irrigated to grow sugar beets for the production of enough sugar to supply all that Canada
requires. A crop which can be grown successfully, and one that would give a great
measure of security to the farmers of Saskatchewan, is alfalfa. As many honourable
senators know, for the successful growing of
alfalfa you must have water. From my experience in Blaine Lake, if one crop is grown
in a dry season it is a failure, but with irrigation you are almost certain to cut two heavy
crops a year.
I understand that the construction of this
dam will make it possible to irrigate some
600,000 acres in an oasis of the province,
which would relieve the recurring dry years.
We have had dry years over the fifty years
I have been in that province, when feed had
to be shipped from Montreal and other distant
places and there was great hardship. Therefore, on the whole, I think that although the
expense of constructing the dam may seem
high, it will be very much worth while. In
my opinion it will be a red-letter day for
Saskatchewan when the dam is finally completed and provides the means of irrigating a
large number of acres for the growing of feed
in the event of an emergency.
Honourable senators, I have much pleasure
in supporting the resolution.
Hon. T. A. Crerar: Honourable senators,
notwithstanding the blessing, or the qualified
blessing, given to this resolution by my
leader (Hon. Mr. Macdonald), I wish to enter
an objection and a protest to this proposal.
If over the last 25 years any one subject in
Saskatchewan has been a political football,
kicked hither and thither across the political
field, it is this South Saskatchewan River
Project.
Hon. Mr. Horner: Who kicked it?
Hon. Mr. Crerar: Our colleague from Blaine
Lake (Hon. Mr. Horner) stated a moment
ago that this would be a measure to give
security to the province of Saskatchewan.
Well, Saskatchewan is a very large province,
one of the largest in the dominion; it extends

SEPTEMBER 3. 1958
from the international boundary several hundred miles north before you reach the point
on the Saskatchewan River where this famous
dam is to be constructed. The plain fact of
the matter is, on all the evidence available,
that from an irrigation point of view all that
would be benefited or that can be benefited
from this huge expenditure of money is
500,000 acres.

Hon. Mr. Horner: There was not one person
from Saskatchewan among the names that
you mentioned.

Hon. Mr. Crerar: If that statement of the
honourable senator from Blaine Lake means
anything at all, the only implication is that the
commission should have been a loaded commission. The Government of the day did the
right thing in retaining outside men to make
the inquiry.
Hon. Mr. Horner: No.

the matter. They got detailed estimates of night. The power development was a littIe

development, the estimate given the committee last night ranged from $24 million
to $41 million.
The irrigation part of the development was
estimated by the minister to cost from $35
million to $45 million. That is just about onehalf of the cost as estimated by the honourable Leader of the Government in response
to a question from the leader on this side
of the house.
Now, honourable senators, how in the
world are we to make head or tail of a
proposal of this kind? It is beyond me. When
the Government comes to Parliament with a
proposal that this country should commit
itself to an expenditure of at least $80 million-I believe it was 80 per cent of cost of
the dam-shouldn't we have more definite
information? I cannot understand it. The
plain fact of the matter is that this proposal
has been so mixed up in the cloudy atmosphere of politics-and emotion also, let me
add-that it is impossible for this house to
have the clear definite information it should
possess before we give our approval to this
resolution.
One other thing may be said. In recent days
we have had quite an interesting illustration of an inquiry in the other house as to
the cost of the Printing Bureau on the other
side of the Ottawa river. The original estimate, we are told, was $6 million, but the
total amount that has been spent to date is
over $16 million. It is worth reflecting that
that was faulty estimating. There is no suggestion, at any rate so far as I have seen,
that there has been any graft or similar
impropriety in the spending of the money;
but we had this estimate and now we find
that the cost has been almost three times that
amount. That is not an unfamiliar thing in
Government administration. In fact, when
the Honourable Charles Dunning was Minister of Finance, I heard him say on one
occasion that whenever he got from a Government department an estimate of what
something was going to cost he felt himself
justified in adding anywhere from 10 per
cent to 25 per cent to it. I certainly do not
wish to enter the realm of prophecy at all,
but it will be a surprise to me if this whole
venture does not cost over $10 million to $20
million above the estimates we now have.
If I do get such a surprise, it will be a
pleasant one.
Now I put the question to the Senate: is
that the manner in which we are to fling
the taxpayers money around? I do not think
it is. My honourable friend from Blaine
Lake paints rosy pictures of what can be
done in the production of feed. Well, if you
use the 500,000 irrigated acres for the production of feed how are you going to produce

sugar beets and other items of agricultural
production? Even if the water can be distributed, I am as sure as that I am talking
to this house today that the thing will prove
to be disappointing.
If we take the statement given to the house
by the Leader of the Government on Monday
that the irrigation development is estimated
to cost $80 millionHon. Mr. Aselline: I arrived at that amount
by subtracting the cost of the dam, reservoir
and power development from the total estimate of $185 million, and I took it for granted
that would be the cost of the irrigation.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: Well, I am not particularly interested in the mathematical calculation made by the honourable gentleman
to arrive at that conclusion. But if it should
be $80 million, or $79 million, I would point
out to the house that that is a capital cost
of $160 per acre on 500,000 acres that will
supposedly benefit from this irrigation.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: The federal Government is not paying any of that; that is all
to be paid by the Province of Saskatchewan.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: Fine. I am glad my
honourable friend reminded me of that, because it brought to my thinking at the moment a point which I might otherwise have
overlooked. I am grateful to him.
Suppose the cost is half of that figure,
say $40 million, that means a capital charge
of $80 per acre against the land that will
benefit from this expenditure. It is quite
true, as the honourable leader has stated,
that the Saskatchewan Government is going
to bear the full cost of the irrigation project,
and I believe a great part of the power
development. But, if it costs even $40 million
to carry through the irrigation part of the
project, an interesting question arises as to
where Saskatchewan is going to get the
money. Would it not have been a proper
question for the federal Government, when
it is footing nearly all the cost of the dam,
to say to its partner, "Show us the evidence
under which you can finance your share of
the proposition"?
Hon. Mr. Bruni: Does the honourable senator not think that the Province of Saskatchewan can raise $5 million a year? Since it will
take eight years to build this dam, if the
province raises $5 million a year for each of
those eight years it will have $40 million.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: That is just the kind of
Alice-in-Wonderland argument that I don't
fall in with. Let me say this to my honourable
friend: should there be a return of drought
conditions-and it is not impossible in Saskatchewan, or in other parts of western
Canada, or indeed in Eastern Canada-let him

SEPTEMBER 3, 1958
then go and see where Saskatchewan is going
to raise that money. I would suggest to him
that he take a look at the financial position
of Saskatchewan in the thirties, when we had
the prolonged drought period.
Hon. Mr. Bruni: Would the honourable
senator permit me to interrupt him?
Hon. Mr. Crerar: Of course.
Hon. Mr. Bruni: The honourable senator
is theorizing on a drought in Saskatchewan.
I reserve the right to theorize on the discovery
of oil and gas there, and if it is found in
quantities similar to those found in Alberta,
there will be ample money in Saskatchewan.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: I am not going to carry
on that dispute with my honourable friend.
But may I ask him a question now, since he
has been good enough to ask me one? Suppose
the Province of Saskatchewan got into financial difficulty over its part of this arrangement and could not carry it through, and
appeared on the doorstep of the Government
at Ottawa and said: "We are through, we are
done, we can't go farther: this will have to
stop. Will you help us?" My question is,
would he help Saskatchewan? I will let him
answer.
Hon. Mr. Bruni: Do you want my personal
opinion, or how the Government of the day
would feel about it? Personally, I would help
Saskatchewan, but I cannot speak for the
Government of ten years hence.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: I was not asking my friend
to speak for the Government ten years hence.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I should think not.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: The probability is that by
that time he certainly will not be speaking
for this Government.
The point is, this is the result of a halfbaked consideration for a vast proposal.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: This has been under
consideration for 15 years.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: We will let it go at that;
I have made my point.
Hon. Mr. Bruni: They said the same thing
about the Hudson Bay Railway.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: I may not live to see the
completion of the dam, but I am quite sure
all honourable gentlemen immediately opposite me will.
To conclude, my criticism is that the
proposition has not been thoroughly analyzed;
we have not got the data before us that we
should have when Parliament is being asked
to vote close to $100 million with an open-end
liability or obligation that no one can measure.
If when this dam is half built the Saskatchewan River comes down in one of its periodic

bursts of flood, the dam goes out, and millions
of dollars' damage is done further down river,
will the Saskatchewan Government be responsible for that? No! As a matter of
fact, I compliment my good friend the
Premier of Saskatchewan on his ability to
put over an excellent deal from the point
of view of his province. The federal Government will have to bear the whole responsibility of any damage that may accrueHon. Mr. Bruni: No.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: -from a faulty dam.
Hon. Mr. Bruni: From a faulty dam, but
not from an act of God, which a flood would
be.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: All right, I will take the
honourable gentleman at his word. Suppose
after you have spent $40 million or $50 million an act of God does occur and the dam
goes out. What are you going to do then?
Hon. Mr. Bruni: Re-negotiate.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: Re-negotiate and build
another dam.
Well, honourable senators, this is a serious
matter, and I state most emphatically that
this project has not had the study that it
should have had. Had this question been
brought up at the beginning of the session we
could have referred the matter to a committee of the house and called experts before
us to find out what their opinions were on
the whole proposal. Then we could have
reached our own conclusions. This agreement was signed on July 25. Why was it not
submitted to Parliament six weeks ago?
Hon. Mr. Aseliine: I tabled it at your request, but you were not here.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: The good intentions of
my honourable friend are no excuse. The
Government should have given this agreement to Parliament at once. It should have
presented then the resolution for ratification,
and we could have had at least several weeks
to inquire into the matter. But what happened?
The Government introduced this
resolution in the house on September 1; and
on September 3, two days later, we are asked
to approve the resolution-and to do so when
we are almost wholly in the dark.
Honourable senators, I do not like that way
of doing public business. I express the hope
and trust that all the rosy expectations of
the protagonists of this undertaking will be
realized. But I am quite willing to stake
what little reputation I have on the prediction that they will not be realized, and that
this country will have to spend tens of
millions of dollars on a project which may
only lead into further difficulties between
Saskatchewan and the federal Government.

Hon. Vincent Dupuis: Honourable senators,
I will add only a few words on this subject.

member from the east, I should take part
in this very important question, which

although any member of this house must
have at heart the interests of the country at

I want to state that in some degree I share
the views of the honourable senator from
Churchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar). It will cost
the country scores of millions of dollars to
accomplish this problematical project. It is
proposed merely by way of resolution; and
it seems to me that under the circumstances
this house should have had some opportunity
to hear about it from those who are better
informed on the subject than I am and, no
doubt, than other members who are not
familiar with Saskatchewan affairs.
One aspect of this matter strikes me very
strongly, although I am not sure whether
the sponsors of the project have had their
attention called to it. It is that the western
provinces possess riches which are even
greater beneath the soil than those on the
surface. Perhaps the subsoils of Saskatchewan and Alberta are the repositories of the

Leader of the Government (Hon. Mr. Aseltine), when he introduced the resolution
before us, stated-I quote from Hansard,
page 732-that:

elsewhere in the province, include ail, gas
and coal. I was told, by the way, that the
city of Regina is built on a coal deposit, and
it may be that beneath the coal are oil and
gas. It is generally admitted that nature has
provided a great part of the province of
Saskatchewan with these resources. There is
but little forest, except in the north. So we
may conclude, without too much risk of
error, that beneath the soil are mineral riches
of all kinds; and when the citizens of Saskatchewan decide to exploit them it will
not be to the advantage of those who are
prepared to invest capital of for this purpose
to have these riches covered by water to a
depth of 180 to 200 feet. So I wanted to ask
those who are better informed about this
project than I am whether we are not right
in contending that it is being pushed through
too quickly and without permitting us to
study it in all its aspects.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: The area to be flooded
is 116,000 acres.
Hon. Norman P. Lambert: Honourable
senators, I should like to contribute, as briefly
as possible, my point of view on the resolution. First, I want to say that I am absolutely
opposed to this agreement, and if the resolulion is passed it will, as far as I am concerned, be passed on division.
A very distinguished leader of this house
stated on one occasion:
Where there is a mandate for legislation which
comes before the Senate; where such legislation was
clearly discussed and placed on the platform of the
successful party in an election, then only in most
exceptional circumstances should there be any
;ttempt or desire on the part of the Upper House
to refuse to implement such legislation by its
concurrence.
It is enough to emphasize the fact that authority
lies behind a popular mandate which the Senate
never can ignore . . . and that only under very
special circumstances should that chamber, even
for purposes only of delay, fail to comply with
an electoral judgment.
Members of the Senate have to make up their
minds to give every Government fair play and
not to stand in the way of legislation unless they
are convinced that it must be defeated on its
merits, and that the consequences of failure to
defert it would be serious.

In the face of this competent judgment or
opinion I submit that this Upper Chamber
is in a position to consider the agreement
on its merits and, as my honourable friend

had to be abandoned because of the character
of the country. The western half of the
irrigation block in Alberta that was under the
National Resources Department of the Canadian Pacific Railway Company had to be
entirely abandoned because of the inability
of the plan to work.
Hon. Mr. Horner: Was it not because there
was too much alkali in the soil?

Hon. Mr. Lambert: If 180,000 acres are
available for irrigation, and that is another
questionHon. Mr. Aseltine: I should have said irrigate by gravity. This represents over onethird of the whole area.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: The minister last night
pictured these 500,000 irrigated acres as being
similar to the lush green irrigated areas
to be found around Lethbridge. I think there
is about as much likelihood of that as there
is of flying to the moon. I don't think those
two areas are comparable in any way. More
than that, the idea of changing the character
of farming in that area of Saskatchewan
to one of mixed farming, truck farming and
vegetable growing is just an hallucination of
the worst kind.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. Lambert: The altitude, the contour of the land, and the quality of the

effect of closing the debate.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: I do not intend to spend
much time in answering those who have
spoken against adoption of this agreement,
but I do want to say that the matter of
building a dam and reservoir in the South
Saskatchewan River has been under discussion and intensive study during the last fifteen years and, as a matter of fact, for many
years prior to that. I cannot sec why honourable senators object at all to the Government of the Dominion of Canada assisting
in this project. We contribute 40 million or
$50 million a year to the Colombo Plan, for
instance. Why not also raise money for developments in our own country? We built the
Hudson Bay railway against all kinds of
opposition, and now we find that the railway
is a paying proposition.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Oh!
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: So I cannot follow at
all my honourable friend from Churchill
(Hon. Mr. Crerar) and others who have
spoken against this measure. Moreover,
during every election that I can think of for
the past twenty years the matter of the
building of this dam bas been one of the
planks in the platforms of the major parties.
One of the main planks of the last election
in the province of Saskatchewan was that of
the construction of this dam, when not only
the Conservative party agreed to assist
Saskatchewan in the building of this project
but every other party pledged itself to do
the same thing. As I pointed out on Monday
evening, the Right Honourable James G.
Gardiner, writing in the last issue of the
Family Herald, came out broadly and
strongly in favour of this proposition. If
honourable senators will read that article
they will find that in his opinion, at least,
the project would be a wonderful thing for
Saskatchewan.
I have every hope that this chamber will
adopt this motion standing in my name, and
approve the construction of this project.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, the question is on the motion of the
Honourable Senator Aseltine, seconded by
the Honourable Senator Brunt:
That it is expedient that the Houses of Parliament approve the agreement between the Government of Canada and the Government of Saskatchewan respecting the South Saskatchewan River

of trains has been increasing, partly as a
result of the large increase in the number
of vehicles using the highways and partly
as a result of the large increase in the length
of railway trains. It is no uncommon sight
out in the prairie country to sec a railway
freight train of a hundred cars travelling
the right of way of the railway, and it takes
a long time for that number of cars to be
pulled by the engine past an intersection
of the road. The length of railway trains
bas been greatly increased because of the
increased power provided by diesel locomotives, as compared with the old type of steam
locomotives. An illustration of the seriousness of this hazard is found in the statistics
for 1957, which show that in that year there
were 51 collisions between motor vehicles
and the side of trains during daylight hours,
and 109 collisions during night hours.
This subject of reflectorized markings on
the side of railway cars bas been under active
consideration in the United States for several vears. In particular, the Great Northern
Railway, in the United States, bas taken the
lead and now bas all its rolling stock
equipped with reflectorized paint.
It is recognized that in every freight train
in Canada there are bound to be some American freight cars, some of which will not be
marked. It is the opinion of the officers of
the Transport Board that, notwithstanding
this fact, and in view of the progress being

SEPTEMBER 3, 1958
made on the subject in the United States of
America, it is highly desirable that Canadian
freight cars be equipped with reflectorized
markings in order to reduce the alarming incidence of motor vehicles running into the
side of freight trains at night. The reason that
the legislation does not provide for locomotives to be similarly equipped with reflectorized markings is that locomotives have
both side and front lights, as well as bells
and horns and similar warnings. It is not
therefore considered necessary at this time
to provide that they be equipped with reflectorized markings.
Bill C-52, in all its aspects, has been carefully studied by the members of the Transport
Board and its technical officers and its provisions have the full support of the board.
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): Can the
honourable senator say at whose expense
these reflectors would be installed on the
sides of the cars?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: The bill says that the
Railway Grade Crossing Fund will grant an
amount not exceeding 80 per cent of the cost
during the next three years.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Yes; and 60 per cent
after that.
Hon. A. K. Hugessen: Honourable senators,
I think we are very much indebted to the
honourable Leader of the Government (Hon.
Mr. Aseltine) for the information which he
has been kind enough to obtain for us as a
result of the questions asked of him yesterday afternoon.
I have just one further question to ask,
and I do not know whether he can give me
any information about it. He referred to the
situation in the United States with respect to
the application of these reflectors and stated
that one railway, I think the Great Northern
Railway, had been a leader in that practice.
Has he any information as to whether the
regulatory body in the United States, which
I think is the Interstate Commerce Commission, has issued any orders making it a general requirement that cars in the United States
should have such reflectors?
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: No, I haven't that information, but I will be glad to obtain it for the
honourable senator and give him the answer
at some other time.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Thank you.
Motion agreed to and bill read third time
and passed.
ESTATE TAX BILL
NON-INSISTENCE UPON SENATE AMENDMENT
The Senate proceeded to consideration of
the message from the House of Commons
on Bill C-37, respecting the taxation of estates.

Hon. W. M. Aselline: Honourable senators,
I move:
That the Senate do not insist upon its fourth
amendment to Bill C-37, intituled An Act respecting the taxation of estates, to which the House of
Commons have disagreed.

He said: Honourable senators, you will
remember that when this bill was given
second reading in this chamber it was referred
to the Standing Committee on Banking and
Commerce. That committee carefully considered the bill during a considerable number
of sittings and eventually reported it back
to this chamber with some eight amendments.
Owing to the fact that one of these amendments was of a contentious nature I made a
motion that the amendments be referred to
the Committee of the Whole so that they
could be considered seriatim. That motion
was agreed to and the bouse went into committee on the bill, with the honourable senator
from Huron-Perth (Hon. Mr. Golding) in
the Chair.
In Committee of the Whole all of the
amendments were considered, and seven of
them were adopted unanimously. One amendment-the one which bas been referred to as
the fourth amendment-did not receive unanimous consent in committee, but it was
concurred in by this chamber when a vote

was taken. This is an amendment to section
26 of the bill. That section, as it stands in
the bill, reads as follows:
For the purposes of this Part, in determining the
value of any property no allowance or deduction
shall be made for on account of income tax.

The amendment made in the Senate
Banking and Commerce Committee added to
the end of that section after the words
"income tax" the following:
-- except where a superannuation or pension
benefit is taxable under the Income Tax Act.

So section 26 as amended by the Senate
Banking and Commerce Committee would
read as follows:
For the purposes of this Part, in determining the
value of any property no allowance or deduction
shall be made for or on account of income tax
except where a superannuation or pension benefit is
taxable under the Income Tax Act.

After these eight amendments were adopted
by the Senate the bill as amended was then
given third reading and returned to the
House of Commons for its consideration.
We are advised that the House of Commons considered the eight amendments made
by the Senate and adopted all of them with
the exception of the fourth, that is the amendment to section 26. The following message
bas been received from the House of Commons returning the bill:
That a message be sent to the Senate to acquaint
their honours that the house agrees to the amendments made by the Senate to Bill C-37. An Act

of larger value.

Honourable senators, section 26 as it stands
unamended in the Estate Tax Bill re-enacts
section 34 of the present Succession Duty
Act and there is no particular change between the said section 34 and section 26 of
the bill. Section 26 therefore would continue
the legislation that has been in effect for
many years under the provisions of the Succession Duty Act, but this amendment to
section 26 of the Estate Tax Bill would introduce considerable change in the law as it
stands in the Succession Duty Act because it
makes a special rule in respect of benefits
received from superannuation or pensions
and therefore discriminates in favour of that
class of property. In my opinion the $60,000
exemption provided in the Estate Tax Bill
would take care of most of such matters,
except in the case of comparatively large
estates.
In my speech on the subject several days
ago I gave my reasons for not being in
faveur of the amendment, and they are
almost exactly the same reasons as those
given by the House of Commons in the resolution passed by that house when returning
the bill to this chamber.
In my opinion, honourable senators, this is
a good bill. It is a relieving taxation measure
and meets with the favour of the greater part
of the people of this country, because the
exemptions are increased to $60,000, with
$10,000 for each child, and se on. I hope that

nothing will be done by the Senate which will
prevent this measure from becoming law,
and that is the reason why I have moved this
motion to the effect that the Senate do not
insist upon the fourth amendment. I think
that the Senate has sufficiently emphasized its
stand in matters of this kind and I hope that
the amendment will net be insisted upon in
the circumstances.
Hon. T. D'Arcy Leonard: Honourable senators, as sponsor of the amendment in question I should like to have the privilege of
speaking to the motion. I may say at the
outset that I intend to vote in favour of the
motion but not for the reasons that have been
outlined by the Leader of the Government
(Hon. Mr. Aseltine), nor for the reasons that
have been set out in the message from the
House of Commons. With those reasons I disagree and I should like to deal with them one
by one.

Before doing so, I would refer to the
remarks of the honourable Leader of the
Government as to section 34 of the present
Succession Duty Act, which section 26 of the

bill would replace. Section 34 has been in
force only since 1952, and even at the time
it was introduced, which was ostensibly for
seme other purpose, the revision of the Succession Duty Act was under consideration;
it was at any rate contemplated, according
to expressions used at that time by the then
Minister of Finance, that the question of
double taxation on a superannuation or pension benefit would be one of the matters
considered as and when the whole Succession
Duty Act was revised.

In the message from the House of Commons,
the first reason given for rejecting the amendment is that it would create discrimination.

I reiterate what I have said on previous occasions, that the amendment would not create
discrimination, but, on the contrary, would
remove a discrimination that now exists.

Once again, may I be permitted to give
an illustration that shows the principle behind
the amendment that is designed to avoid
putting an estate tax upon another tax? Parliament last year made amendments to the
Income Tax Act to provide for what are
called "Self-employed retirement plans", so
that an individual could pay premiums for a
retirement annuity and have those premiums,
within certain limits, deducted from his income tax. Previously the privilege of deducting payments to pension plans from taxable

income extended only to the group pension
plans, those plans that in general cover industrial employees throughout this country.

In order to equalize the position of the selfemployed or the case where an employer had
only a few employees, these amendments were

made to the Income Tax Act to allow a
deferment of income tax on the premiums
paid into a self-employed retirement plan.
That plan has come into operation only this
year, and I think it is as yet too early to say
exactly how cases are going to be dealt with

under it.

The illustration I am going to give is
derived from the statute itself, and I think

it shows the principle we were endeavouring
to put into the Estate Tax Bill in so far
as superannuation and pension benefits are

concerned.

If an individual who is paying

into a self-employment retirement fund dies
before his contract matures-that is, as-

suming his retirement plan is to mature at
age 65, and he dies before that age and
before be receives any payments under his
plan-the act itself specifies that his premiums
are to be refunded to his estate, but subject

to a deduction of 15 per cent, which is added
to his income tax for that year. In other

SEPTEMBER 3, 1958

words, his estate gets only 85 per cent of
the amount to his credit at the time of his
death; the other 15 per cent never reaches
his estate, and indeed the trustee of the
retirement plan is required to deduct 15 per
cent and send a cheque for that amout to
the Receiver General, and send a cheque for
the 85 per cent to the estate. It is my submission that any fair-minded person would
say that the estate tax in such case should
be levied upon only the 85 per cent that the
estate receives, and not in addition upon the
15 per cent tax that goes to the treasury.
That illustrates the principle behind the
amendment, that the tax that has been deferred in lifetime and still remains to be paid at
time of death should not be included in the
valuation of the superannuation or pension
benefit, and that as long as it is included it
is a discrimination against this particular
type of case. It was to remove that discrimination that the amendment was supported in this house.
The second reason advanced by the House
of Commons is that the amendment is not
workable. The effect of the amendment would
have been to cause these superannuation and
pension benefits to be valued at fair market
value, at time of death, which is the usual
and proper standard for the valuation of most
other assets of an estate. Fair market value
at time of death does not necessarily mean
the same thing as the actual amount that
will be realized out of an asset. Real estate,
shares of stock and other securities are
valued at date of death, but may realize
either more or less than that value. An
annuity is valued on an actuarial table, but
no annuitant lives to the exact period specified
by the mortality table-he lives for either a
longer or a shorter time. Similarly, in a case
of estimating the burden of the income tax
liability that is built into the superannuation
or pension benefit at the time of death, it
does not have to measure accurately the
exact amount that may or may not be paid
for income tax in future. All that the amendment would have done was bring into calculation at the time of death the potential burden
that attaches to that superannuation benefit
by an existing liability chargeable against it.
The third reason given by the House of
Commons is that the amendment would reduce
the revenues of the Crown. I do not propose
to debate at this time the right of the Senate
to reduce taxes, other than to say I think
such right exists. But I do point out that
in our proceedings in the Banking and Commerce committee Dr. Eaton, speaking on
behalf of the Department of Finance, said:
It appears that this legislation will not be in
effect and therefore will not give any revenue at
all probably in the current year.

I would say further, it should be noted
that the pith and substance of the amendment is concerned with the valuation of the
type of asset in question, and not with the
matter of taxation itself.
In the message from the House of Commons there is a suggestion that the amendment would have the effect of beneflting
larger rather than smaller estates. I think
that suggestion creates an erroneous impression. The type of superannuation and
pension benefits covered by the amendment
is that type of group pension plans where
income tax is deferred.
There are strict limitations on the amount
that can be put into such plan, the maximum
being $1,500 in any one year; the usual
amount is on the average 5 per cent of the
person's salary or wages. Behind that provision is the idea that if a man had to pay
income tax on that amount as well as put
it into the pension he would not be able to
do so. Therefore, the type of superannuation
and pension benefit that the amendment
covers is the usual type applicable to employees throughout this country.
On the other hand, in so far as men of
substantial means are concerned, they may
buy a pension without limit out of tax-paid
income. This particular amendment would
not affect that type of pension whatsoever.
There should be no suggestion that this
amendment is designed to, or does in fact,
react to the benefit of people of large incomes, because they themselves are now covered, or can be covered, by the type of
pension where there is no built-in tax
liability at the time of death.
If I might sum up these reasons which have
been given in the message from the House
of Commons, I might properly venture the
opinion that there is a certain inconsistency
between them. If the amendment really
created a discrimination which was clearly
visible I would want to have no part in it,
and I think such discrimination in itself
would be sufficient reason to send it back
to this house, without bringing in any question of its workability or of the revenues of
the Crown. But I sense that there is a feeling
that this discrimination does exist, and that
the real trouble may be in finding out how
to make a workable provision for eliminating
that discrimination. Finally, if the amendment is not workable, of course it cannot
affect the revenues of the Crown. So I would
hope that with further consideration a way
may yet be found to eliminate that discrimination which, I say, now exists.
We in this house have given very careful
consideration to the bill and to this amendment, as is evident in the proceedings of

SENATE

the Senate Banking and Commerce Committee, which are available to all the public.
It will be seen that we heard representations
which were made to us by responsible organizations from all parts of Canada; and this
particular amendment was put forward in a
desire to meet those representations and to
deal with a situation which, we felt, needed
correction.
For very different reasons from those given
by the other house, I think we should not
insist on this amendment. Our parliamentary
system in Canada is a bicameral system.
Our two houses of Parliament are not competitive bodies, nor does one house sit in
appeal, as it were, from the other. All
legislation must pass both bodies, and even
though there may not be agreement between
them the relationship between them is part
of a nicely adjusted system of checks and
balances to ensure the orderly processes of
democratic government. Over the years since
Confederation, by tolerance, understanding
and common sense we have made that system
work. Our proceedings on this bill so far
have been in line with the traditional role
played by the Senate. I will quote, if I may,
words of Sir John A. Macdonald, which words
are probably known to all of you:
There would be no use of an Upper House if
it did not exercise when it thought proper the right
of opposing or amending or passing the legislation
of the Lower House.

It is true that we could take further steps
now, and this has happened in the past; but
I see no useful purpose to be gained by
taking those steps. The amendment in dispute here is of minor consequence by comparison with the whole subject-matter of the
bill. Even without this amendment, the bill
is a good bill. It should pass. Even though
we may be completely in the right, and the
House of Commons in the wrong, it would be
the people of Canada who would suffer if,
because of a difference of opinion at this
late date in the session, this bill should not
go through.
I think we have discharged our responsibility in endeavouring to secure this amendment, and the responsibility now lies with
the Government. I am content to let it rest
there. I believe that in time the anomaly
with respect to these pensions will be cleared
up. The Minister in the other place indicated
that this is not a perfect bill and that from
time to time it will come up for amendment
and reconsideration. But on the principle
that the lesser evil should be swallowed up
in the greater good, I am prepared to see
the bill go through as it is now. It is not
really a constitutional issue that is at stake.
In my view, nothing that has been said or

done in this case derogates from the fundamental rights and privileges of either house.
It is purely a question of dealing sensibly
with the situation which, in these circumstances, is before us; and I believe that we
can agree with this motion, and not insist
on our amendment, without prejudice to any
future case where the issue might be more
important.
For these reasons, honourable senators, I
propose to vote for the motion.
Hon. Saller A. Hayden:
Honourable
senators, I could not let this opportunity pass
without saying a few words on the question
of the message which has been received from
the House of Commons in relation to this
bill.
I regret the action of the Commons in
rejecting the amendment. I believe the
honourable Leader of the Government (Hon.
Mr. Aseltine) said it was called "the Fourth
Amendment". If I may be facetious for the
moment, it may be that when the general
public throughout Canada become aware of
what has been lost by reason of what I
regard as a hasty and ill-advised action in
dealing in this summary way with the
amendment, the members in the other place
may wish that they had a "Fifth Amendment" which they could invoke against some
of their irate constituents when trying to
explain to them why they have deprived
them of a benefit which, on any fair examination of the facts, should go to those who
receive a pension or superannuation benefit,
which is subject to some income tax deduction, on the happening of the death of a
person. It does seem inherently wrong to
persist in a situation whereby the income tax
element is considered as a factor in enhancing the value in a deceased person's estate
of a benefit which goes to the widow who
survives. Yet the reasons which were given
are such as suggest that we were the ones
who gave ill-considered and hasty action in
this regard, because the House of Commons in
its message says that we have done something
that discriminates in favour of a certain
class of property, that we proposed a provision which is unworkable, and that we have
-perish the thought-reduced the revenues
of the Government and also a possible estate
tax liability on larger estates.
Well, for the benefit of those who were not
at the meetings of the Banking and Commerce
Committee I want honourable senators to
know that the Minister of Finance, who
sponsored this bill, appeared before us twice
on the first occasion, when we opened our
hearings, at which time he made a general
statement.
There
were hearings when
representations were made by various groups,

SEPTEMBER 3, 1958
and then we came to a consideration of the
bill clause by clause, after standing over
some 12 or 14 sections because various members thought that further and particular consideration should be given to those clauses
and indicated the amendments which they
might present. Accordingly we invited the
minister to attend again and to make his
representations on the basis of those particular sections.
In order that the Minister might be as well
prepared as possible, I took it upon myself
to phone him considerably in advance of his
attendance in committee and I enumerated
for him the sections that were stood, and in
a general summation I told him the reasoning
behind the proposed changes. I indicated what
I believed the nature of the changes would
be, and the degree to which I thought the
members of the committee would press them.
I told him, of course, that I was giving him
my own interpretation of what had taken
place, and that I was doing it to assist him
in addressing the committee. Well, the minister did attend before the committee and,
when the committee members expressed their
views, as the record will show, the minister
indicated he would be agreeable to four or
five of the changes and said that amendments
would be drafted to give effect to them. But
I want it known that it was the Senate that
drew attention to these items and it was not,
as was suggested in the other house, the
minister who proposed these amendments in
our committee.
When we were dealing with the question
of pensions, the kind of amendment under
consideration then was different from the
one which was ultimately agreed upon, and
the objections the minister made in committee-he even went to the extent of saying he
recoiled from the proposed change-were
based on the type of amendment we were
then considering, which was to the effect
that the minister should prescribe some
formula or table for determination of the
income tax content in a pension benefit. You
will find in the verbatim reports of the committee that pages of his remarks are devoted
to explaining how impossible it would be for
him to do this and that it was a task he
was not prepared to assume. When we finally
worked out the amendment it struck me as
being simple in its language and that it
would be simple to administer. By providing
this exception you are saying that where you
capitalize the value of a pension or superannuation benefit which carries an impost of
income tax, in arriving at fair market value
you are entitled to give some consideration
to the element of income tax that exists in
the benefit that is passing and reduce the
value accordingly.

For them to say it is unworkable is a
judgment which I refuse to accept, for these
reasons. I think it is total surrender to expediency, for in my view it is workable.
There are many more difficult situations in
the Estate Tax Bill. In a direct and blunt
way the bill provides for an arbitrary basis
of evaluation. For instance, take the famous
controlled companies section that I spoke
about on second reading of this bill, companies that seem to be singled out for special
treatment in a derogatory rather than a
beneficial way. In one instance, in attempting to arrive at the value of shares of a
deceased person, who may have been one
of a family group holding sufficient shares
to control a company but who himself held
only a minority interest, the section provided
that his shares would be valued on the basis
of a majority holding of shares. Very simple
language! When it came to dealing with a
problem that frightened them they prescribed
an arbitrary method.
Let us consider the reference the honourable gentleman from Toronto-Rosedale (Hon.
Mr. Leonard) made to the method of taxing
return premiums on a pension plan of a selfemployed person. In the case of a person
dying before the pension falls in there is an
arbitrary income tax levy of 15 per cent on
the premiums returned. So when the fourth
amendment is brusquely thrust aside and dismissed on the basis that it is unworkable,
I say it is only unworkable in the minds
of those who have no desire to recognize or
work out a problem that requires attention.
There has been talk about discrimination. There is plenty of discrimination in this
bill, but it is beneficial. It is a beneficial
kind of discrimination if it favours people
who would be entitled to certain pension
and superannuation benefits. For instance,
under this bill, if a man dies and leaves a
widow there is a $60,000 exemption that is
applied simply because he has left a widow,
whether or not she inherits one nickel. But
if a wife dies and she leaves a healthy
husband, the exemption deductible is only
$40,000. So you have those differences, and
that is a kind of discrimination in favour
of one situation as opposed to another. If the
surviving husband is infirm, that is not
enough to raise his exemption from $40,000
to $60,000. He must also have with him a
child under or over 21 years of age, dependent on him, and who also is infirm.
You have these things all through the bill.
Surely to claim that this amendment creates
discrimination amounts to a surrender and
to a weakness in thinking rather than to a
willingness to face up to the issue. All
through the bill recognition is given to different situations, and some are dealt with

anomaly should be accepted. On the merits

expressed in the amendment which has been
referred back to us by the other place.
I do not need to repeat what was said in
committee or what has been so aptly
expressed in this house by the two honourable senators who spoke before me. However, I think it is proper that another question should be clarified, one which was
raised not only in the other place but also
in newspapers of this country, with regard
to the Senate's power to amend money bills.
Although the question bas not been raised
specifically on this point, I would say, in the
first place, that the Commons have accepted
that principle by accepting seven out of our
eight amendments to the bill in this instance.
In the second place, there should be no possible contention on this subject, but there is
a great deal of confusion in the public opinion, which is still maintained by articles
which I have read in the newspapers. I
have these articles before me now, and it is
not necessary to make further reference to
them, except in a general way. They compare the powers of the Senate in that respect
to the powers of the House of Lords, and
that is altogether wrong under the fundamental law governing our houses of Parliament. If honourable senators will refer to
the British North America Act they will find
that by section 18 the powers of the Senate
are not the powers of the House of Lords.
Section 18 reads as follows:
The privileges, immunities, and powers to be held,
enjoyed and exercised by the Senate and by the
House of Commons, and by the members thereof
respectively, shall be such as are from time to
time defined by Act of the Parliament of Canada,
but so that any Act of the Parliament of Canada
defining such privileges, immunities, and powers
shall not confer any privileges, immunities, or
powers, exceeding those at the passing of such Act
held, enjoyed, and exercised by the Commons
House of Parliament of the United Kingdom of
Great Britain and Ireland, and by the members
thereof.

It will be seen, therefore, that under section 18 of the British North America Act
the powers of the Senate are the same as
the powers of the House of Commons.
With regard to money bills, there is only
one difference between the powers of the
House of Commons and the powers of the
Senate. It is that money bills must be introduced in the House of Commons. But once
they are introduced in the House of Commons there is no longer any difference between the powers of the Senate and the
powers of the Commons to deal with them.
The only section of the British North
America Act, providing for this is section 54
which reads as follows:
54. It shall not be lawful for the House of Commons to adopt or pass any Vote Resolution, Address,
or Bill for the appropriation of any part of the
public revenue, or of any tax or impost, to any
purpose than has not been first recommended to
that bouse by message of the Governor General
in the session in which such Vote, Resolution,
Address, or Bill is proposed.

So there is a limitation with respect to
money bills which may affect us, so far as
the scheme of taxation of the Government
to raise the necessary revenue to provide
for the functioning of the Government of
Canada is concerned, and the same limitation applies to the House of Commons.
In the House of Commons, since Confederation, it has been a constant practice of the
Speaker of the House of Commons to restrain
members from amending money bills. Of
course this restraint has been applied with
modification, but under section 54 of the
British North America Act the limitations
with respect to money bills apply to members
of the House of Commons in the same way
as to members of the Senate. A member of
the Senate cannot introduce a resolution, bill
or amendment to impose or increase a tax,
but neither can any member of the House
of Commons do so, except a member of the
Privy Council, with the previous consent of
His Excellency the Governor General. Nor
can we in the Senate change the general
scheme of expenditures, because if you move
that an expenditure be made you have got
to provide the revenues by ways and means,
and that can be done only by imposing
taxation. But, honourable senators, we can
reduce taxation, and that is what we are
doing in this case. Our powers in that regard
are exactly the same as those of the House
of Commons. This is provided for by the
British North America Act, our Constitution,
which governs both houses of Parliament.
Therefore it is most impertinent for the
House of Commons to pass a standing order
such as Standing Order No. 63. This order
reads as follows:
All aids and supplies granted to Her Majesty by
the Parliament of Canada are the sole gift of the

SENATE
House of Commons, and all bills for granting such
aid and supplies ought to begin with the house,
as it is the undoubted right of the house to direct,
limit and appoint in all such bills, the ends, purposes, considerations, conditions, limitations, and
qualifications of such grants, which are not alterable by the Senate.

This most impertinent standing order
should be erased from the Book of Rules of
the House of Commons, because that bouse
has no power to determine the powers of the
Senate. The powers of the Senate are determined by the British North America Act, and
therefore it is preposterous to state in a
standing order that aids and supplies are
the sole gift of the House of Commons. If
they were the sole gift of the House of
Commons why should money bills have to
come to the Senate for first, second and third
readings, and to be passed by this house? No
bill can become law unless the Senate passes
it. This applies to money bills as well as
to all other kinds of bills.
Honourable senators, I suggest that these
remarks, which are directed to the constitutional question of the Senate and of the House
of Commons, are appropriate in view of the
discussion which has taken place on this bill
and the many articles which have been published in the press. I hope these words of
mine will clear the atmosphere and bring
some light on this very important subject.

Hon. George S. White: Honourable senators, I voted for this amendment in the
Banking and Commerce Committee and I
voted for the amendment when it was before
this chamber in the Committee of the Whole.
I thought it was a good amendment and a
necessary amendment, and I still think so.
In fact, as far as I am concerned I felt in
committee that there were many other
amendments that should have been made to
this bill.
The honourable senator from Toronto
(Hon. Mr. Hayden) covered the ground very
well, and I agree and concur in his remarks.
As to the message from the House of Commons and the four reasons given for not
accepting this amendment, I am not impressed in the slightest degree. I think the
reasons given do not apply. As stated by the
honourable senator from Toronto, they are
more or less a reflection on our Standing
Committee on Banking and Commerce.
I am one of those who have had experience
in the Banking and Commerce Committee of
the House of Commons and also in the Banking and Commerce Committee of this house;
and I have no hesitation in saying, honourable senators, that in the short time I have
been in the Senate and served on our committee I have been greatly amazed and
pleased at the very fine work it does on
any bill referred to it. If you take the report
of the Banking and Commerce Committee
of the other place containing the proceedings on the examination of the Estate Tax
Bill and compare it with the report of the
proceedings of the Senate committee on the
same bill, I am sure you will agree with
my conclusion.
During the hearings in the Banking and
Commerce committee it was emphasized and
re-emphasized that this bill was a simplification of estates taxation, as if it were something that would lessen the work of the
department. I never could agree with that,
because I feel that while this bill has some
benefits, it is going to increase the legal
expenses in the administration of estates,
and it is going to have the effect of scaring
away many capable people who otherwise
might have been willing to act as executors
in centres outside the large cities which
have the benefit of trust companies.
Hon. Mr. Bruni: It won't scare you away,
will it?
Hon. Mr. White: No, it won't scare me;
and it is going to be of great benefit to
members of the legal profession because
they will be able to demand more fees.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: I can't see that.

Hon. William R. Bruni: Honourable senators, as one of the three members on the
Government side of this chamber who voted
for this amendment I think it is proper and
fitting that I say a few words at this time.
At the time I voted for the fourth amendment to this bill I was of the opinion that
it was a good amendment, and I still believe
that it is a good amendment. I think the
fourth amendment improves the Estate Tax
Bill. The other place, however, has seen fit
to reject this amendment, and that leaves us
in the position of deciding whether or not we
are going to have an Estate Tax Act. Without
exception, every honourable senator who
spoke on this bill respecting the taxation of
estates said that it was a good bill. There is
no doubt about it. It is a great improvement
on the present Succession Duty Act, and the
Senate in its wisdom endeavoured to improve
on this bill by passing this amendment. We
have made our position very clear to the general public, but I think that we must keep
in mind-and this is most important-that
the people of Canada will be better off with
an Estate Tax Act without this amendment
than with no Estate Tax Act at all. It is for
this reason that I think all honourable senators should support this motion and pass the
Hon. Mr. White: You will find that an
executor will not turn around unless he has
present bill.

SEPTEMBER 3, 1958
a solicitor at his elbow, and I think he
would be wise to keep him there.
I was impressed by the representations
made by the various ladies' organizations,
both by their briefs and by their representatives who appeared before the committee.
Some honourable senators have said today
that this bill will probably come back for
amendment. I can only say what I said before: I remember when the present act came
to the House of Commons in 1941; I objected
to certain things then and I was assured that
after the act had been in operation for a
time and we saw how it worked, the
wrinkles would be ironed out. Well, if you
subtract 1941 from 1958 you will see how
long it takes to iron out wrinkles.
Like all the other senators who have spoken
today, I agree that there are certain benefits
in this bill, and I for one would not like to
see the bill killed. It is only for that reason
that I will vote for this motion.
Hon. Muriel McQ. Fergusson: Honourable
senators, when this bill was considered in
Committee of the Whole I supported the
amendment of the honourable senator from
Toronto-Rosedale (Hon. Mr. Leonard). For
that reason I would like to speak briefly on
this motion today.
This was not a case of my jumping on the
bandwagon for something that I thought was
popular; it is not a new idea to me. This
question has been studied by the Canadian
Committee on the Status of Women, which
had representatives appear before our Banking and Commerce Committee, and I am
familiar with their work. They have studied
this feature of the legislation since it was
introduced in the Succession Duty Act in
1952 and are definitely of the opinion that
to require that income tax and succession
duty or estate tax be paid on the sane money
is double taxation, to which they are strongly
opposed. In the committee they said they
were unalterably opposed to paying estate
tax on income which they have never
received. Under the present act the income
tax is deducted after the amount of a superannuation benefit is capitalized, and therefore it is felt that the paying of succession
duty or estate tax, under the present act or
the new bill, on money which the successor
has never handled, is objectionable.
Honourable senators who did not attend the
committee may have noticed that the brief
of the women's organizations did not refer to
this matter. It has been brought to my
attention that when the women representatives appeared personally, and the matter
came up through representatives of the trust
companies and other organizations, the
women strongly supported them. It was a
57075-4-49

matter on which they were very familiar
and were able to speak fluently.
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): That
is right.
Hon. Mrs. Fergusson: In the matter of
double taxation, I would bring to the attention of the house a point that comes to my
mind. I am quite sure the women members
of the organizations to which I belong are
not impressed by the statement that this is
not double taxation. We feel it is. What
strikes me forcefully is the fact that Canada
is apparently opposed in principle to double
taxation. If it is not, why has Parliament
ratified so many agreements with countries
such as the United Kingdom and the United
States, to prevent double taxation in the
succession duty and income tax fields? This
provision in the Estate Tax Bill definitely
seems to be a violation of the principle that
we in Canada have accepted in dealing with
other countries. If we are going to recognize
the principle in our dealings with other
countries, surely we should adopt it in our
domestic affairs as well.
I should like to speak very briefly on the
three reasons given by the other house for
the return of the bill to the Senate. First,
they say that the amendment would create
a discrimination in favour of a particular
class or property. Well, does not every tax
act create some discrimination as between
citizens of a country? If we raise or lower
the customs tariff, we discriminate against
someone.
Any taxation is going to be
basically unfair to someone. The only
reason it is enacted is that it can be justified. It may be that the Government feels
it can justify this taxation, which I think
discriminates against people who receive
superannuation or pension benefits. But it
seems to me it would be preferable to
increase the rates in the higher brackets.
The second point which was raised by the
minister in refusing the Senate's amendment
was that the amendment was unworkable.
Well, I find that reason rather difficult to
accept. It is well known that pensions and
annuities are the easiest assets to identify.
When I recall some of the complicated calculations which the officials of the department are required to make in handling
estates I do not think that this particular
amendment would present any insurmountable difficulties. In any case, as the honourable senator from Toronto (Hon. Mr. Hayden)
has said, if there is any great difficulty it
could be overcome by setting up an arbitrary
formula to be followed in these cases.
The third reason given by the other house
for rejecting the amendment is that it would
reduce Government revenues, particularly

SENATE
revenues from estates of larger value. Well,
I have read the Hansard reports of the
debates in the other house and the reports
of the committees of both houses, and from
all that material I gathered the impression
that the amount of revenue that was expected
to be received from this source would not
be great. In any case, although I am not
going to enter into a discussion on the constitutional issue, I certainly think if the Senate wished to pass legislation that would
reduce Government revenues it has every
right to do so. I doubt very much if this
amendment would tend to reduce revenue
from estates of larger value, for those who
leave large estates are not the ones who
arrange to provide most of these superannuation or pension benefits; it is those who
do not have large estates who try to make
such arrangements to take care of people
they leave behind.
Honourable senators, like others who have
spoken on this debate, I feel that this is a
good bill and I should be sorry to see it
defeated. It is a much better measure than
the Succession Duty Act. I am also reluctant to relinquish the amendment, which I
feel is very important and, if not accepted
now, should be a subject of amending legislation in the future, so that eventually it
will become the law of Canada.
Hon W. Ross Macdonald: Honourable
senators, what I intended to say has been
said at least four or five times this afternoon, so it is not my intention to delay
the house longer on this proposal to accept
the decision of the House of Commons. I
would like it to be noted, however, that the
amendment was rejected in the House of
Commons on its merits and I cannot agree
with the reasons given by the Commons for
its rejection. The reasons have been explained
several times, so I shall not repeat them.
I think we should adopt the motion. As
honourable senators have stated, this bill is
better than the present act. Just how much
better, I am not prepared to say; but I noted
that one of the witnesses before the committee stated that it would be welcomed by
millions of insurance policyholders. It increases the exemption, in the case of a man
dying leaving a widow, from $50,000 to
$60,000, and there is an additional exemption
of $10,000 in respect of every child under 21

years of age. I would hesitate to hold up
the bill until the next session of Parliament,
in view of the fact that many people will
die in the meantime and if the measure is
delayed their wives and children will not
get the benefit of this provision. Of course
we could oppose the position which the House
of Commons has taken; we possess all the
necessary powers to resist its action. The
honourable senator from Toronto-Rosedale
(Hon. Mr. Leonard) quoted Sir John A.
Macdonald. May I be permitted to quote
another great Canadian Prime Minister, Sir
Robert Borden? He said:
Parliamentary government could not continue to
function if every constituent element of ParliamentThis includes, of course, the Senate.
-were constantly to exercise its powers to the
legal limit.

We could exercise our powers to the legal
limit and resist the position which the House
of Commons has taken. But, as the bill is,
by and large, better than the present legislation, I think we would be very foolish to
resist the motion.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators,
the question is on the motion of the honourable Senator Aseltine:
That the Senate do not insist upon its fourth
amendment to Bill C-37, an act respecting the
taxation of estates.

Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to

THE SENATE

VISIT OF UNITED STATES SENATORS
Hon. W. M. Aseltine: Honourable senators,
we have with us in the gallery of the Senate
today two distinguished senators from the
United States of America who are paying us
a visit. I think it would be a nice gesture
on our part if we asked them to come and
take a seat on the floor of the chamber.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Aseline: I would also say further
that we have not a very big program today
so we won't be able to entertain them as
we could have done had they been here
yesterday. Our Order Paper is clear, and
we have for consideration today only the
report of the Standing Committee on Transport and Communications on the Broadcasting
Bill. Until such time as the two measures
remaining to be considered this session come
from the House of Commons we shall have
to adjourn during pleasure or until tomorrow
afternoon.
I take great pleasure in inviting, with the
concurrence of the Senate, the Honourable
George D. Aiken and the Honourable Homer
E. Capehart, two distinguished members of
the United States Senate, to honour us by
taking seats on the floor of this house.
Hon. W. Ross Macdonald: Honourable senators, it gives me great pleasure to join with
the Leader of the Government in welcoming
these two distinguished United States senators
to this house. As honourable senators know,
both these gentlemen have taken a very active
part in the proposals to set up a joint committee composed of members of the Congress
of the United States and the Parliament of
Canada for the purpose of meeting together
from time to time, probably informally, to
discuss our mutual problems. I am sure we
are all delighted to know that the Senate of
the United States is so interested in this
development that two of its distinguished
members have come to Canada to join
representatives of our Parliament in further
considering the proposals before the committee is actually set up.
I most heartily join with the Leader of the
Government in welcoming Senator Aiken and
Senator Capehart to our chamber, and I hope
they will each take a seat on the floor of this
house.

BROADCASTING BILL
COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS

CONCURRED IN

Hon. A. K. Hugessen, Chairman of the
Standing Committee on Transport and Communications, presented the report of the committee on Bill C-55.
The report was read by the Clerk Assistant
as follows:
The Standing Committee on Transport and Communications, to whom was referred the Bill (C-55)
intituled:
"An
Act
respecting
Broadcasting",
have in obedience to the order of reference of
August 28, 1958, examined the said bill and now
report the saine with the following amendments:
1. Page 6, line 35: Immediately after "14." insert "(1)"
2. Page 7: Immediately after line 4 add the
following as subclause (2):

SENATE
"(2) The Governor in Council may exempt from
the operation of this section, upon such terms and
conditions as the Governor in Council may prescribe, any person who, at the time of the coming
into force of this act, was the holder of a licence
and was not a person described in paragraph (a)
or (b) of subsection (1)."
3. Page 9, line 6: Strike out "pleasure" and
substitute there for "good behaviour"
4. Page 9, lines 19 to 22: Strike out lines 19 to 22,
the
substitute therefor
and
both inclusive,
following:
the age of seventy years, and
"upon attaining
may be removed at any time, in the case of the
President or Vice-President, by the Governor in
Council for cause, an.d, in any other case, by the
Governor General on address of the Senate and
House of commons."

The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators,
when shall these amendments be taken into
consideration?
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Honourable senators,
I move that the amendments be concurred
in now.
Perhaps I should say a few words to the
house on the subject of these amendments
which have just been read. There are only
two amendments of any importance. The first
is an amendment to the first part of the bill,
dealing with the set-up of the Board of Broadcast Governors established by the bill. Under
section 14, as it read when it came to us,
there were severe restrictions upon the issue
of licences by the board to persons or corporations having a non-Canadian interest. The
section provides that no licence shall be issued
by the board to anyone other than a Canadian
citizen, or a corporation having two-thirds of
its directors Canadian citizens and at least
three-fourths of its shares owned by Canadian
citizens or other Canadian companies. When

we came to consider the bill in committee we
found that there are at present several broadcasting stations, and I think one television
station, which cannot comply with those requirements as to ownership. In other words,
they are owned by outside interests to an
extent greater than would be permitted by
this section 14. The minister in charge of the
bill appeared before the committee and gave
evidence, which was very helpful indeed. He
said that there was no intention in this bill
of depriving people of their acquired rights
or of interfering with the rights of existing
companies owning broadcasting or television
stations. Therefore, we have included this
first amendment to the effect that section 14
need not apply, if the Governor in Council
so permits, in the case of any person who at
the time of the coming into force of this act
could not comply with the requirements of
section 14. That, I think, is an obviously
good provision, and it preserves the rights of
holders of existing broadcasting and television licences who otherwise would be de-

prived of the right of obtaining renewals of
their licences if this bill had gone through in
its original form.
The second important amendment is to section 22 of the bill, that is, in the second part
of the bill, dealing with the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. It has to do with the
tenure of office of the two principal officers
of that corporation.
Perhaps I should explain to the house that
this bill sets up two independent bodies, the
Board of Broadcast Governors, with certain
officers and directors, and the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, with a President, a VicePresident, and nine directors.
Now, with respect to all the officers of the
Board of Broadcast Governors, and with respect to the nine directors of the Canadian
Broadcasting Corporation, provision is made
in the bill that they shall hold office during
a period of years and during good behaviour,
and shall be removable only by the Governor
General upon a joint address of the Senate
and House of Commons. However, with respect to the President and Vice-President of
the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, the
bill as it came to us provided that they should
hold office during pleasure. It was felt that
if that phrase were to remain in the bill it
might imply the possibility of political control
over those two officers and that they could be
removed without cause at any time by the
minister in charge of the legislation. No one
suspected that this Government or any future
Government would so act, but it was thought
to be better to provide for some specific and
more definite means for the removal of those
two officers. Therefore we amended that section to provide that the President and VicePresident of the Canadian Broadcasting
Corporation can only be removed
Governor in Council for cause.

be made, considering the existence of the
Statute of Westminster. As honourable senators know, this statute was passed by the
members of the British Commonwealth after
the holding of two meetings of the members
of the British Empire Association, one in
1926 and the other in 1930.
In 1926 it was decided, as far as the
relations of the members of the Commonwealth are concerned, that:
They are autonomous communities within the
British Empire, equal in status, in no way subordinate one to another in any aspect of their
domestic or internal affairs, though united by a
common allegiance to the Crown and freely associated as members of the British Commonwealth.

BUSINESS OF THE SENATE
On the motion to adjourn:
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Honourable senators, we
had expected to receive this afternoon the
bill to amend the Customs Act and the bill
to amend the Canadian Citizenship Act, but
before coming into the chamber I had a conference with the Leader of the Government
in the other place and he advised me there
was no possibility of either measure reaching
us today.
I would suggest that after we adjourn ail
honourable senators remain in the chamber
to meet the two honourable senators from
the United States, get acquainted with them
and discuss any matters that they might wish
to talk about. Is that agreeable to honourable members?
Hon. Senators: Agreed.
The Senate adjourned until tomorrow at
3 p.m.

Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Honourable senators, I
suggest that the Senate adjourn during pleasure, to meet at the call of the bell, at
approximately 9 o'clock.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: The honourable leader
proposes that we adjourn, perhaps to meet at
9 o'clock, at the call of the bell. How long
are we to wait? Shall we wait until 10
o'clock or 11 o'clock?
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: If there is nothing over
here by 9 o'clock we can adjourn until tomorrow morning.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: The understanding is that
the bell will call us at 9 o'clock?
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Or a little earlier, if
necessary.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: So long as we know
where we are at. Personally I have no desire
to sit around the chamber all evening waiting for something to come from the other
place.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: The Customs Bill is in
Committee of the Whole of the other house,
and it is quite possible that it will be before
us presently.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Does the honourable
Leader of the Government (Hon. Mr. Aseltine) still expect that Parliament will prorogue tomorrow?
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: That is my fond expectation.
The Senate adjourned during pleasure.

CUSTOMS BILL
FIRST READING

The Hon. the Speaker informed the Senate
that a message had been received from the
House of Commons with Bill C-51, to amend
the Customs Act.
Bill read first time.
SECOND

READING

The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators,
when shall this bill be read the second time?
Hon. Lionel Choquette: I move that the bill
be read the second time now.
Honourable senators, this bill has four essential objects which it attempts to accomplish. These are: (a) a revision of the
present provisions regarding the determination of value for duty on goods coming into
Canada; (b) the addition to the valuation
provisions of a new provision which bas
as its object a further safeguarding against
dumping into Canada of goods at a price
below the cost of production thereof, plus the
normal gross profit usually earned in that
trade; (c) the provision of a new basis for
the valuation of fresh fruits and vegetables
of a class or kind produced in Canada during
advance marketing periods for such products
in the country of origin, and (d) a revision
of the appeal provisions on appeals to the
Exchequer Court from decisions of the Tariff
Board including: (1) the elimination of the
necessity for obtaining leave to appeal by
the deputy minister or appellant before the
Tariff Board; (2) extension of the time from
30 to 60 days within which an appeal may
be taken; (3) setting out a complete code of
procedure, and (4) provisions to allow appeals
from decisions of the deputy minister prohibiting the entry into Canada of salacious
literature, referred to in item 1201 of the
Customs Tariff, to be taken to the courts
rather than the Tariff Board.
When goods are imported into Canada it
is, in every case, a requirement that the
value of those goods be determined. In
most cases they will be subject to the
ordinary duty prescribed in the Customs
Tariff and, further, in every case that value
is used for the purpose of determining the
excise and sales tax to which such goods are
subject.

The general procedure followed is that the
appraiser at the border determines the value
for duty in the first instance, very often
with the assistance or direction of dominion
customs appraisers in Ottawa. This value is
determined at present under the provisions
of sections 35 to 40 of the Customs Act, which
provisions alone deal with value. If an importer is not satisfied with the determination
as to value, or indeed tariff classification
as well, he may, in accordance with section 43
of the Customs Act, appeal from the appraiser's
determination to a dominion customs appraiser. If, in turn, he is not satisfied with
the determination of the dominion customs
appraiser, he may then appeal to the deputy
minister, who in due course issues a "redetermination". By section 44 of the Customs
Act a decision of the deputy minister as to
classification or value is subject to appeal
to the Tariff Board.
Thus in all cases, except where the statute
provides that the minister shall determine
value, the value is determined by the deputy
minister, and an importer has a right of
appeal to the Tariff Board as to classification
or value. By section 45 of the Customs Act
an appeal lies from the Tariff Board, with
leave, to the Exchequer Court and then to
the Supreme Court.
On the other hand, those provisions in the
statute which provide that the minister, as
opposed to the deputy minister, shall determine value are not subject to appeals, since
section 44 provides for a right of appeal
only from the decision of the deputy minister.
Turning to the valuation provisions of the
present law, these are subject to certain
ancillary rules laid down in subsections (2)
to (7) of section 35, which are set out opposite
page 1 of the bill. These valuation provisions
break down into four rather separate and distinct rules. These are (1) the "like goods
rule" found in subsections 2 and 3, (2) the
"similar goods rule" found in subsections 4
and 5, (3) the "ministerial rule" found in
subsection 6, and (4) the "basket or cost
plus rule" found in subsection 7.
The like goods rule in the present law
provides in effect that where the same goods
as are imported into Canada are sold in
the country of origin under competitive conditions in the same quantities in a free transaction the value for duty shall be that price.
This is the cardinal rule of determination
of value which has been in the Canadian
Customs law since the Galt Tariff of 1858
and is also the cardinal rule for determination
of value agreed to by all the signatories of
the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade,
or GATT.
The similar goods rule is used only where
the like good rule cannot apply because, for

SENATE
example, some goods as are imported are not
sold in the country of origin. This often
happens when a manufacturer makes a product especially for the Canadian market and
does not sell the same goods in his home
market. An example is the case where a Canadian market requires a different size or
pattern of goods or a different trademark.
The similar goods rule under the present law
directs you to assess the value of the goods
imported on the basis of the price which is
obtained in the country of origin on the sale
of the similar goods in, of course, a free
transaction.
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): "Like
goods", I take it, means identical goods, and
"similar" does not mean identical?
Hon. Mr. Choquette: That is right. They
can be dissimilar in size, in weight or in
colour. I will give the correct definition of
"like goods". "Like goods" are taken by the
department to be goods sold in the country
of export identical in all respects to those
imported or identical except for some very
minor differences, for example, colour.
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): Will the
honourable gentleman mind saying what he
is reading from? Is it a ruling by the department or an explanation?
Hon. Mr. Choquette: It is an explanation.
I should add that the like goods rule has
applied in 75 per cent of the cases of all the
merchandise imported in the last few years.
It is the cardinal rule followed by the department and it still is the main one to be
followed.
Now I come to the similar goods rule. This
is used only where the like goods rule cannot
apply because, for example, some goods as are
imported are not sold in the country of origin.
This often happens when a manufacturer
makes a product especially for the Canadian
market and does not sell the same goods in
his home market. An example is the case
where a Canadian market requires a different
size or pattern of goods, or a different trademark. The similar goods rule under the
present law directs you to assess the value
of the goods imported on the basis of the
price which is obtained in the country of
origin on the sale of the similar goods in, of
course, a free transaction.
The ministerial rule applies only when like
)r similar goods are not sold in the country
of origin or, alternatively, there isn't an
established market for such goods there. In
such cases the value is determined by the
minister, and you will note from what I have
said that there would be no right of appeal
from such determination. That is on account

of present section 44 which provides for
appeals from the deputy minister.
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): It is a
discretion on the part of the minister?
Hon. Mr. Choquette: Yes.
The cost plus rule is the one which applies
when all else fails. It provides, as a means
of determining what the manufacturer would
have charged for his product in the country
of origin, that you add to the cost of the
production of the goods a reasonable gross
profit, or administrative costs plus selling
costs and profit.
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): Does the
honourable gentleman mind questions being
asked?
Hon. Mr. Choquette: Not at all; if I can
answer them promptly I will be glad to do so.
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): His
explanation of these four different categories
of determining value is very clear. However, this question always puzzles me: the
explanation usually given when the officials
are administering the act is, the first rule is
the one set out in subsections 2 and 3 of
section 35, and the second rule is applied
under subsections 4 and 5; if they cannot
apply either of those rules they go to subsection 6, and if that is not applicable they
go to subsection 7. Under what rule of law,
if there is one-and I am not asking the
question to create a problem-must they
proceed in that way under this bill or can
they proceed without following that order?
I know, in practice, they do follow that order,
but I don't know that there is anything in
the new legislation which compels them to
proceed in that way.
Hon. Mr. Choquette: My answer to that
would be this: over a period of years the officials of the department have found that to
be the most practical procedure. Since most
of our business is done with our neighbours
to the south, we having about the same tastes
and needs for goods as they, that is the most
convenient way to apply the rule for imports
in the like goods group. That is always
the starting point.
Turning to the provisions of the bill: clause
1 provides that all of the existing valuation
provisions, section 35 to 40 of the act, are
repealed and new provisions substituted
therefor. Except for the two new valuation
provisions to which I referred earlier, these
new provisions found in clause 1 are only a
revision of the present provisions and there
is no major change of policy. The like goods
rule is still retained as the cardinal rule for
determining value. Further, it is retained

SEPTEMBER 6, 1958
with substantially the same principles applying, although you will note the rule has been
expanded to clarify the existing provisions,
to remove doubt where doubt existed; and in
doing so regard has been had to decisions of
the Tariff Board and the courts. It is much
like any codification of principles. Honourable senators will appreciate that over a
period of years, custom, decisions of the
board and decisions of the various courts
have almost become law to be codified, and
if that is put down in sections such as we
have before us you can rest assured that
they are based on such decisions, precedents
and custom, in the strict sense of the word.
While the rules may seem technical on a
brief reading, their primary function is to
define the types of sales which serve as a
basis for determining value and to expressly
exclude some sales which, for obvious reasons,
could not serve as an indication of the value
of goods. A simple example of a sale to be
excluded is one from a subsidiary company
to a parent company. Honourable senators
realize that in such a case that sale would
not be at a real market value, because it is
from a subsidiary company to a parent company. This would hardly, I am sure you will
agree, be at a price which one could say
with confidence represents the true value of
the goods in question and the value which,
if the vendor were selling such goods on the
open market, he would necessarily obtain
for them.
The purpose of these rules, very simply,
is to find sales in the country of origin to
persons who are at the same trade level as
the importer, so that, if the importer in
Canada is a wholesaler, you would look
only to sales to wholesalers in the country of
origin, and if those sales were sales where
there was no relation between the parties, and
took place at the same time and at the same
place, they would be ordinarily satisfactory
as an indication of the value of the goods.
Regard is, of course, had to a number of
other factors, including whether it is a free
economy country where conditions are competitive, and also regard is had to the amount
which would be paid for the quantity sold,
to the extent that this is practical.
The proposed section 36 clarifies the
present practice and understanding of the
department in respect to valuation, and you
will be interested to know that approximately
75 per cent of the goods that enter Canada
are valued under the like quantities rule.
That is in accordance with the answer I
gave to the honourable senator from Ottawa
West (Hon. Mr. Connolly) a while ago: I am
repeating it now.
Turning to the proposed section 37, this
provision incorporates the similar goods and
57075-4-50

cost plus rules of the present act. Under the
present act you are required, by the similar
goods rule, to take the price at which similar
goods were sold in the country of origin.
Thus, if the similar goods sold for more
than the goods coming into Canada, it could
hardly be said, for that reason alone, that
goods were "similar" within the meaning
of the present provisions, because of the
difference in cost. The new provision would,
in effect, broaden the scope of the similar
goods rule, by providing for an adjustment
of price, having regard to the difference in
cost of production of the goods imported and
the similar goods sold in the country of
origin. Thus, if beans were imported into
Canada in 12 ounce packages, and were
sold only in 10 ounce packages in the country
of origin, the value would be the cost of
production of the goods imported, to which
would be added the same mark-up or gross
profit as is earned on the 10 ounce packages
when sold in the country of origin. If the
manufacturer made 35 per cent gross profit
on his 10 ounce packages, the value of the
12 ounce package coming into Canada would
be the cost of production plus the same
mark-up.
I am sure honourable senators will agree
that this method of arriving at a value is
probably the only one which could be
adopted in these circumstances to show what
the exporter would have sold his goods for
in the country of origin if they had been
sold there, because, of course, the same
mark-up over cost of production is used.
Hon. Mr. Burchill: How is cost of production in a foreign country computed?
Hon. Mr. Choquette: As I understand it,
the department has, in several countries with
which we transact business, experts who are
close to our Canadian legation, and if information received from manufacturers in
that country of origin does not satisfy us,
our experts can verify the facts. Is that
answer satisfactory to the honourable senator?
Hon. Mr. Burchill: Yes.
Hon. Mr. Choquette: I might say that this
method of determining value has been followed in the department for years under the
present similar goods rule and cost plus rule,
as the case may be, and this new provision
clarifies the law in this respect and there is
no change.
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): That is,
in section 37 of the bill.
Hon. Mr. Choquette: Yes. I should add that
it is consistent with GATT. That agreement
provides that where the like quantities rule

SENATE

does not apply you find the nearest ascertainable equivalent. Clearly this similar goods
rule is the only reasonable way of finding
the nearest ascertainable equivalent.
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): I wonder

whether the honourable gentleman is completely right about that. Perhaps the information
can be given a little later. But I come back
again to what I said earlier, that the provisions of the present act cover, first of all,
like goods, then similar goods, then the right
of the minister to value, and finally the cost
of production rule. There is nothing here
which says that these rules must be applied
in this order, but I believe that under the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Tradeperhaps the honourable senator from Ottawa
East (Hon. Mr. Choquette) can refer to it;
I haven't it here-there are three alternative
methods of valuing, and I think they are set
out in the order in which they should be
used. In other words, as I recall it-I may
be mistaken-under GATT you must apply
the rules in the order in which they are
shown in the treaty. I do not think that is
provided for in the legislation. I am looking
for information.
Hon. Mr. Choquette: Probably the honourable gentleman will get that information
toward the end of my remarks.
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): I might
add, by way of clarification, that it seems
to me, though I may be wrong, that it is at
the discretion of the department or the minister to choose which method of valuation
shall apply in any given set of circumstances.

Hon. Mr. Choquette: I would say, as I
think I have said before, that if we are
convinced, as we are by now, that in 75
per cent of the cases the first rule of like
goods can be applied, and that in maybe 15
per cent the similar goods rule has application, the logical consequence would be to
value first according to the like goods rule
and follow in the order mentioned.
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): Quite so.

Hon. Mr. Choquette: Turning then to the
ministerial rule, this is found substantially in
the new proposed section 38. This contains
a number of provisions and circumstances
under which the value shall be determined,
not necessarily in accordance with like or
similar goods rules but in a manner to be
determined bv the minister. It is important
to note at the outset that the value will not
be determined by the minister but by the
appraisers and the deputy minister in due
course, following the manner prescribed by
the minister. Thus there will be, as is the
case with like or similar goods, an appeal
in every case as to the determination of value.

By paragraph (a) it is provided that if the
value cannot be determined because like or
similar goods are not sold in the country of
origin, then the value will be determined in
a manner prescribed by the minister. This
would apply, for example, to determination
of the value of blueprints which are not
sold separately. It would also apply to goods
coming from countries where competitive conditions do not exist in the market in question,
for example, where state monopolistic conditions exist.
With regard to paragraph (b), these classes
of cases have to be dealt with separately from
the like or similar goods rule because, in
most cases, those rules either do not apply
or apply in circumstances which are either
unfair to the importer or to the domestic
producers.
With regard to subparagraph (i), those goods
which corne into Canada to be assembled,
packaged or further manufactured in Canada,
or to enter into the course of manufacture in
Canada, and with respect to subparagraph
(v) which deals with goods used in the process
of manufacture, these are set out to be dealt
with separately because they cover various
types of cases where relief is given from the
high value such goods would obtain under the
like or similar goods rule. For example, if
goods which came into Canada to be packaged took a value which gave no effect to
the cost of the packaging operation in Canada,
the result would very probably be that the
packaging would be carried out in the country
of origin, and, of course, that much work
would not be done in Canada. Further, for
example, if pharmaceuticals are imported into
Canada in a semi-finished condition, it is
obviously desirable to make sure that as much
work as possible is done in Canada. Applying
the like or similar goods rule, the value would
undoubtedly be so great as to discourage work
in Canada. Accordingly these cases must be
set aside to be dealt with separately. The
circumstances are so many and varied that
each must be dealt with in a separate way.
With regard to second quality goods, remnants, and so on, as I am sure you are
aware, these present some danger to Canadian industry and therefore must be dealt
with separately.
In conclusion, in respect to section 38, I
would remind the house that under the
present law these substantially fall within
the ministerial rule from which there is no
appeal. Under these new provisions, as I have
indicated, there would be a right of appeal
and this is the only change of any substance
with regard to this provision. The minister
has assured us that in dealing with each class
of case he proposes to follow exactly the

SEPTEMBER 6, 1958
practice which has been followed in the past
and is being followed today.
Leaving aside section 39 for the moment,
the new section 40 is, of course, necessary
to take care of the situation where, for example, a manufacturer refuses to permit officers of the department to have access to his
figures for cost of production, and so on.
Because these cases must be dealt with
separately, of course, the value would have
to be determined in the manner prescribed
by the minister which seems most appropriate
in the particular case.
With regard to the proposed sections
40A and 40B, there is nothing new in these
provisions with the exception of the new
fresh fruits and vegetables provision which
I will discuss in a minute. The rules set out
in these two sections are currently found in
subsections 8 to 12 of section 35 and sections 36 to 38 of the present law. There is
no change in policy involved here, and for
that reason I do not think it is necessary
to comment on these provisions.
The proposed section 39 is, of course, a
new provision which was announced by the
Minister of Finance in his budget address.
Its object is, of course, to take care of situations where goods are sold to Canada in
distress situations. The essence of the rule
is that, when the minister is satisfied that
a Canadian industry is being damaged
because goods are being imported into Canada in circumstances where, if the value for
duty as determined under the ordinary valuation provisions is less than an amount
which reflects the cost of production of those
goods plus the normal mark-up which is
ordinarily made in that particular industry,
then the value will be increased by an
amount which reflects the difference.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: May I ask the honourable gentleman a question?

Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): I realize they go to the country of origin, but
must they go to the maunfacturing establishment in which the goods imported were actually manufactured or can they make their
determination in a manufacturing establishment other than the one which produced
the goods imported into Canada?
Hon. Mr. Choquette: I will get that information for my honourable friend at the
end of my remarks.
I will give an example here to illustrate
the point I referred to a moment ago. An
example might be a situation where a
manufacturer has sold 60 per cent of his
manufacturing run at a price of 70 cents and
those goods cost 40 cents to manufacture.
Conditions in the market changed and in
order to reduce inventory he wishes to unload quickly the balance or remaining 40
per cent of the goods on hand. He therefore,
because of economic conditions, is prepared
to sell for 50 cents and does so in the country
of origin and also exports to Canada. Obviously this price is below the cost of production and a reasonable profit, having
regard to the amount which he ordinarily
sold them for, yet since the goods are sold
for 50 cents in that country and the same
goods are sent to Canada at 50 cents, if there
were no safeguard in our law, such as this
new provision, the goods would come in at
a value of 50 cents, which, of course, could
very well result in serious damage to domestic industry.
Hon. Mr. Dupuis: When a comparison is
made by the officers of the department I am
sure they take into account the cost of production in the country of origin.
Hon. Mr. Choquette: Yes.

Hon. Mr. Dupuis: For example, let us say
that because of low labour costs in the
country of origin it costs 10 cents to produce
Hon. Mr. Choquette: Yes.
certain goods which cost $1 to produce in

class or kind of such goods imported into such
region or part of Canada, and during such period
as the Minister may specify, or may authorize the
minister to prescribe the manner in which such
value for duty shall be determined.

Hon. Mr. Dupuis: Clause 39, as I understand
it, is a clause that could apply to antidumping?
Hon. Mr. Choquette: Yes, the Governor in
Council can authorize the minister, if the
minister is so satisfied, as he would under
section 39.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: May I ask a question?
Probably this bill will not go to committee,
so I hope His Honour the Speaker will allow
a little latitude to the rules. The manner of
establishing the cost of production is very
important. A few moments ago when I asked
a question of the honourable senator who is
explaining the bill, he said that the cost of
production would be the cost of production
in the country of origin, and he gave an
instance, ignoring the cost of production in the
country of origin altogether, giving an illustration of goods manufactured in Japan. Has
the Governor in Council the power to set
aside the question of cost of production and
establish a new valuation for duty purposes?
Hon. Mr. Choquette: Only for the purpose,
I would say, of preventing dumping.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: It doesn't matter what the
purpose is; I am not interested in that at the
moment. What I am interested in is whether
the Governor in Council has that power under
this legislation.
Hon. Mr. Choqueite: Yes, in extraordinary
cases, and I have given an example of an
extraordinary case.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: And who determines the
extraordinary case?
Hon. Mr. Choquette: Well, I suppose the
competent staff of the Customs Department,
who are alert in finding that out. I would say
the determination would originate in complaints from our own Canadian manufacturers,
through the usual investigation that is carried on, and reports made to the department.
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): Would
not the answer to the question asked by the
honourable senator from Churchill (Hon. Mr.
Crerar), in the opinion of the honourable
senator from Ottawa East (Hon. Mr. Choquette), be contained in section 40 of the bill?
Would he look at that section to see if that
is not right? Section 40 reads as follows:
Where sufficient information has not been furnished or is not available to enable the determination of cost of production, gross profit or fair market

value under section 36, 37 or 39, the cost of production, gross profit or fair market value, as the
case may be, shall be determined in such manner
as the Minister prescribes.

Hon. Mr. Power: That is not the case at all.
The case cited by the sponsor of the bill is
a case where the cost of production in the
country of origin is known, and that is not
covered by section 40. I am asking myself,
though, if that is not covered by section 40a,
subsection (7) (a), and if that would be where
the Governor in Council is given the power
to establish duty for any purposes at any time
he likes. That looks to me to be the part of
the bill which confers very wide powers on
the Governor in Council.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I think the first two
lines of section 39(1) give the minister the
authority.
Hon. Mr. Power: This is where sufficient information has not been supplied. In the case
given by way of example, the importation of
goods from Japan, where the cost of production of the article was two cents and the
normal mark-up profit would be another two
cents, so that the value of the article here
normally would be four cents when it cornes
to the customs-in that case, as explained by
the honourable gentleman, the minister has
the right to make the article worth 50 cents,
if he likes. Now, where does he get the
authority for that?
Hon. Mr. Choquelie: I get that authority
frorn page 6 of the bill at section 4 0A(7) (c),
which reads:
-where at any time it appears to the satisfaction
of the Governor in Council on a report from the
Minister that goods of any kind not entitled to
entry under the British Preferential tariff or any
lower tariff are being imported into Canada under
such conditions as prejudicially or injuriously to
affect the interests of Canadian producers or manufacturers, the Governor in Council may authorize
the Minister to determine the value for duty of any
class or kind of such goods, imported into such
region or part of Canada and during such period
as the Minister may specify,-

Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): This is
the new provision, is it not?
Hon. Mr. Choquette: No. That is the one
I have already read, in explaining the case
I gave.
Hon. Mr. Power: You must have read it
quickly, because we did not hear you.
Hon. Mr. Choquette: Oh, I am sorry.
Now, in circumstances such as this, if the
minister is satisfied that injury is or may be
caused to a domestic industry, he may so
report to the Governor in Council, and the
Governor in Council may bring this new provision into operation by appropriate order.
But the working of this order is important
and should be carefully noted. The function

SEPTEMBER 6, 1958
of the minister is to report to the Governor
in Council after satisfying himself as to the
injury to a Canadian industry, and the only
function of the Governor in Council is to
bring this section into force. After that, it
is then a matter for the appraiser to determine the cost of production and the proper
gross profit normally earned in the trade. His
determination is subject to appeal to the
dominion customs appraiser, then to the
deputy minister, and then to the Tariff
Board, in the ordinary way. This, bonourable senators will note, is a very marked
change from the comparable provisions which
existed in the valuation law prior to 1948.
Then, there was no right of appeal, and
action under this provision might be said to
have been more or less arbitrary.
It will further be noted that an order under
this provision is limited in its application to
a period not exceeding one year.

imported into such region or part of Canada and
during such period as the Minister may specify, or
may authorize the Minister to prescribe the manner
in which such value for duty shall be determined,
and the value so determined shall be deemed to be
fair market value of such goods.

Hon. Mr. Choquette: There is no appeal if
it was the minister's decision.
Hon. Mr. Power: You could not appeal to
the dominion appraiser from a decision rendered by his boss, the minister.
Hon. Mr. Choquette: If the minister bas
made his decision, that is the end of it, and
there is no protection in the existing law or
even in the amendment to the bill from the
minister's decision.
Hon. Mr. Gouin: If a complaint arose about
the manner in which the decision of the
Governor in Council was being carried out,
there would be the usual appeal, but just on
the question of the application of the method.

for duty of any class or kind of such goods, dumping or countervailing duty provisions.

SENATE
Further, as is the case in the proposed section
39, under GATT this provision only applies
where there is a threatened material injury
to domestic industry.
In the note to article VII of GATT you will
see that it provides that a country might
assess duty uniformly either on the basis of
an exporter's prices for like merchandise or
jn the general price level of like merchandise
when sold in the country of export. This new
provision is intended merely to assess duty
in cases where there is threatened injury
to domestic industry on the basis of the
general price level of like merchandise when
sold in the country of export. I should add,
as well, that the cost plus concept of determining value for duty is not at all in conflict
with GATT and this was so determined by
a group of experts on customs valuation at
a review session of GATT in 1955.
Now with regard to fresh fruits and
vegetables: this new provision is a new basis
for valuation of fresh fruits and vegetables
and adopts the average value concept presently employed to determine the value of
manufactured goods when the price in the
country of export is low because of a marketing period. This is in subsection 12 of section 35 of the present law. The new section
is designed to provide a measure of protection to Canadian producers of fresh fruits
and vegetables against importations of such
goods at low prices.
For geographical
reasons, the peak production period of many
fresh fruits and vegetables grown in the
United States precedes that in Canada; and
when Canadian production has started, the
United States goods are beginning to be
disposed of at lower prices than ordinarily
pertain in that market, and below that to
which the Canadian producer is entitled.
It is proposed, in applying this section,
to have regard to the Dominion Bureau of
Statistics figures for the purposes of averaging the value at which fresh fruits and
vegetables were imported over the three
calendar years prior to importation.
With regard to clause 2 of the bill, this
would repeal the present provisions respecting appeals to the Exchequer Court from
decisions of the Tariff Board as to tariff
clarification or value for duty of goods, and
substitutes therefor a complete code of appeal which should prove helpful in practice
before the court. The essential changes are,
in the first place, the elimination of the necessity of the deputy minister or an appellant
before the Tariff Board obtaining leave to
appeal, as has been the case. The requirement to obtain leave to appeal has, in practice, proved to be an additional expensive
step, and in about 30 applications, leave to
appeal has been refused in only one case.

It therefore seems unnecessary and undesirable to continue the obligation to apply
for leave. However, as before, an appeal is
still restricted to a question of law.
Secondly, in practice, it has been found
that the 30-day period within which an appeal could be taken has been too short, and
the proposed legislation would increase the
period to 60 days.
Of interest in the specific rules of practice
to be followed before the Exchequer Court,
you will note the right of cross-appeal, which
is new. Clause 3 of the bill is a revision
of section 46 of the Customs Act, and the sole
purpose is to clarify that on a reference to
the Tariff Board by the deputy minister there
is a right of appeal to the Exchequer Court.
The new section 46A provides that in respect
of salaclous literature, which has been prohibited entry into Canada, the appeal lies
not to the Tariff Board, as has been the case,
but to the county or district court or, in the
province of Quebec, to the Superior Court
in the county or district where the port of
entry is situated or the importer resides.
Honourable senators will recall that the
Tariff Board at the hearing of a recent appeal
as to whether the book Peyton Place should
be prohibited entry into Canada, recommended that the board should be relieved
of the responsibility of hearing appeals in
connection with that type of matter.
Clause 4 of the bill is merely consequential
and has no substantive effect.
Clause 5 deals with the coming into force
of the provisions in respect of fresh fruits
and vegetables.
Honourable senators, that about concludes
our explanation. I made a statement in my
maiden speech before this house to the effect
that our Civil Service was probably the best
in the world. That opinion was based on
my close contact with the Civil Service
throughout my life, having been born and
raised in Ottawa. Since that time I have
had the pleasure and privilege of coming in
close contact with experts in the various
departments, when it was necessary for me
or others to be briefed by those experts. I
wish now to compliment them, especially
the two gentlemen, Mr. R. W. McKimm and
Mr. A. R. Hind, who were most helpful to
me in preparing my presentation of this bill
to you today.
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): Honourable senators, before there are any extended
remarks, may I ask one question of the
honourable gentleman?
Reverting again to section 4 0A, subsection

Hon. Mr. Choqueite: Yes.

SENATE
Honourable senators who have been members here over the years, as well as those
who have had experience in the other place,
know that the practice has been to dispose
of legislation before passing the estimates.
Why that procedure was not followed this
year I am not going to say, but, if it had
been, this bill would have been before us
three or four days ago. In the other house
legislation was considered on Monday and
Tuesday last, but this bill, instead of having
been taken up at once, was put at the bottom
of the list, and was not called until all
departmental estimates had been considered.
Because this course was followed, we have
not received the bill until now.
I would point out that for the past two
days this bouse bas done no business; it
has been waiting for legislation. Why did
we not get it? Because the Government,
which is responsible for the procedure in
the other house, decided that the Senate
should not get the bill until the last hours of
the last day.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: I would not say that.
Hon. Mr. Bruni: I do not think that is a
fair statement.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: If the honourable
Leader of the Government (Hon. Mr. Aseltine)
will not go that far, he must agree that that
is the result of the procedure followed
whether deliberately or not, in the other
bouse.
Hon. Mr. Bruni: Probably because of the
long debate carried on by the Opposition.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: My honourable friend
has not followed my argument; he did not
listen to what I have said. I will repeat it
for his benefit: I am sure other honourable
senators got my meaning. On Monday and
Tuesday of this week, in the other house,
legislation was considered. This bill was
under discussion there last Tuesday evening,
but on Wednesday morning, instead of its
consideration being continued and completed,
it was put to the end of the list, estimates
were taken up, and debate on this bill was
not renewed until yesterday afternoon. That
is my point. We should have got this bill
before, instead of sitting around, seeing our
numbers gradually decrease. Honourable senators got tired of waiting. There is nothing
more fatiguing than to wait around for legislation. One has only to glance over the
benches here to see how few of us are left;
and I am not referring only to supporters of
the Government. With this comparatively
small number, about 25 per cent of our membership, we are asked to consider this legislation. An even worse feature is that, as the
honourable senator from Churchill (Hon. Mr.

Crerar) has said, it is now too late to send
the bill to committee, though it should have
gone there to receive the closest scrutiny.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: We can sit all next week.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: My honourable friend
says that we can sit all next week. I doubt
if he would be prepared to do that, after
the Commons has finished its work. He does
not mean it; he knows we cannot do it. He
has brought this bill here at the last minute,
when we can give it merely cursory consideration and cannot send it to committee.
So what must we do now? Well, I do not
feel that it would be the proper course for
this house, with so small an opportunity for
consideration, to refuse to pass the bill at this
time. I think we should point out its weaknesses, and then lay it at the door of the
Government, which will have to bear the
responsibility for the results.
Honourable senators, for those reasons I
do not intend to take too much time discussing the bill. It would be a futile effort at
this late date. The sponsor referred at some
length to the provisions with respect to appeals. Well, what do these provisions amount
to for practical purposes? Let us say that
when a shipment of goods comes into this
country, the appraiser assesses the value, the
deputy minister assesses the value, and there
is an appeal to the Exchequer Court and to
the Supreme Court. In the meantime the
goods either rot or go out of style. There are
few appeals. It takes so long to go through
the procedure of appeal that in most cases
the appellants get discouraged and either do
not commence proceedings or withdraw. It is
necessary to have provisions dealing with
appeals, but they are not nearly as important
as the main question of determining the
value of imported goods for duty purposes.
I feel that the change in the method of determining this value could have very farreaching and harmful effects on Canada's
trading relationships. As honourable senators know, Canada is one of many trading
nations of the world coming under an international agreement known as GATT. The
provisions for arriving at valuation under
GATT are based on the recognized principle
of establishing the fair market value in accordance with the price in the country of
origin. As a matter of fact, since Confederation the principle of valuation in Canada has
been based upon the fair market value of
like goods when sold in the home market in
similar circumstances. Now what are we doing? We entered into an agreement under
GATT on the understanding that the fair
market value would be the value of goods
in the home market, but now we are cancelling the provisions of GATT in that

SEPTEMBER 6, 1958

respect. There is going to be established a
new method as to arriving at-I won't say
the fair market value but the value for duty
purposes. How is that value to be arrived
at? First of all, I would point out that over
the years the right of taxation has been
inherent in the Parliament of Canada. Only
Parliament has been empowered to tax. As
honourable senators know, taxation measures
are introduced in the other bouse, but before
they are so introduced any honourable member there can rise and express grievance on
any subject. Under the provisions of this
bill, the Government of the day, the Governor
in Council, which is the cabinet, can fix the
tax and no one will be able to stand up in
Parliament and express his grievance before
the tax comes into effect. Why do I make
this statement? No one can deny that under
the provisions of this bill the duty on any
goods entering Canada can be determined
by the Governor in Council. And any duty
is a tax. So we are turning over to the
Government of the day the power to tax. I
would refer the house to clause 39 in the
bill, which has been read in part, but which
I think should be read in full. It begins:
(1) Where the minister is satisfied that material
injury has been or may be caused to any Industry
In Canada ...
The sponsor read this part but be certainly
did not stress the word "may". In other words,
the minister does not have to be satisfied
that material injury bas been caused; he only
bas to be satisfied that material injury may
be caused. The minister may not know
whether any damage has been caused by
goods coming into Canada, but if in his
opinion damage may be caused to any industry in Canada, or any portion thereof, by
reason of the importation of any new or
unused goods or class of such goods at a
value for duty less than the cost of production thereof, be may so report to the Governor
in Council. Well, this is going to be difficult
to administer. I don't know whether the
minister will have made an inquiry prior to
the arrival of goods but, in any event, if in
his opinion goods are coming into Canada
at a price less than the cost of production
thereof, plus a reasonable amount for gross
profit, and be thinks this may cause material
damage to any industry in Canada, he may so
report to the Governor in Council. That is, he
reports to the cabinet, and the section goes on:

increased to an amount equal to the cost of production thereof plus a reasonable amount for gross
profit, having regard to the gross profit generally
earned in that trade in the country of export, to
be determined in the manner prescribed in section 37.

Now, in spite of what the honourable senator said in introducing this bill, I would
point out that section 37 states that when
comparison for duty has to be made with
similar goods, the value for duty-unlike
the provision in the present act-is determined by the cost of production, plus gross
profit.
The honourable senator from Gulf (Hon.
Mr. Power) raised the question of the power
of the minister to make an inquiry as to the
cost of production in the country of origin,
and the sponsor of the bill said the power was
provided by section 40A(7)(c). But I would
point out that section 39(1) provides that
where the minister is satisfied that material
injury has been or may be caused, then the
minister may make this inquiry; he is not
bound by the other sections of the act.
Now, honourable senators, the cardinal
principle of valuation, which bas been the
principle of valuation since Confederation
and is based on the fair market value of like
goods when sold in the home market in similar circumstances, is being replaced by one
based on cost of production plus profit or
reasonable profit, and that long-established
procedure is being replaced by the discretionary or arbitrary power of the minister to fix
valuations. This gives the minister-the Government of the day-wide and arbitrary
powers. The executive bas taken far-reaching
powers unto itself to deal with customs
valuations. In other words, the taxation on
imports is being turned over to the control of
cabinet. I cannot see how a fair reading of
this bill can lead to any other conclusion.
Honourable senators, although it has not
been mentioned by the sponsor, this measure,
as I understand it, is being introduced primarily to help the textile industry. Throughout the last election campaign the Prime Minister mentioned on several occasions-and I
suppose in every textile town be visitedhis intention to help the textile industry. I
think we would all like to help the industry.
We on this side of the bouse, I am sure, would
do anything within our power which is fair
to all concerned to help it. But is this bill
going to help the textile industry?
-notwithstanding anything in this actI do not intend to delay the bouse on this

SENATE
honourable senators of the dire consequences
of that legislation, not only to the textile industry, but to all industry in this country. I
feel that we are travelling on a dangerous
path, and that before many years have passed
we will find that this proposed legislation,
instead of being beneficial to the textile industry, will be harmful not only to it, but
to the industry of the country at large.
Honourable senators, one thing that bothers
me about this proposed legislation is that it
is apt to have a very serious effect on our
international trade, especially with our neighbour to the south. The honourable senator
from Ottawa East (Hon. Mr. Choquette), in
speaking on the Customs Tariff Bill, quoted
an editorial from the Ottawa Journal, which
may be found on page 660 of Senate Hansard
of this session. I thought it an excellent
editorial, and I kept it, and have it before
me now. The honourable senator pointed out
how the United States was in many ways
trying to develop trade with Canada by reducing its tariff on goods exported from
Canada. If I remember correctly, he lauded
the President of the United States for resisting the effort to increase the tariff.
Honourable senators, we know that this
bill is going to have the effect of increasing
the tariff on goods coming into Canada; it
is taking just the opposite step that was
taken by the United States. I will not take
up the time of the house by reading the
editorial to which I refer, but I point out
that the honourable senator, having a few
weeks ago praised the United States and said
that Canada should go along the same way
and improve its trading relations with that
country, now comes to this bouse and presents
a bill which is bound to have a detrimental
effect on trade, not only with the United
States, but with the rest of the world.
Oh, it was not so long ago that a proposal
was made to divert-I think that was the
word used-15 per cent of our trade with
the United States to Great Britain or to the
Commonwealth countries. Well, this bill,
if its supporters still stand by it, cannot help
that plan whatsoever, because the British
preference is not exempt from the provisions
of this bill. There is a reference in section 36
of the act to the British preference, but if
section 39 is examined it will be seen that the
countries which have the benefit of the British
preferential agreement are not exempt, and
goods coming from those countries are subject
to the same provisions for taxation by the
ministry as goods coming from any other
country. Therefore, honourable senators, in
this way we are nullifying to a considerable
extent not only the agreement we have under
GATT but also the agreement we have with
Commonwealth countries.

What is the result going to be? Well,
the day-to-day results might be something
like this: you pay a visit to the United States
and bring back goods. The appraiser will
ask you, "How much did you pay for the
goods?" You give the price you paid, and
the appraiser will then say, "Oh, no, that
is not the price we are going to charge
you duty on; we are going to charge you
duty on that price but we are also going to
charge you a duty on what we think was the
cost of production and what we think should
be the gross profit on what you bought."
Now, you know what you paid, so you will

have to pay duty on what you paid, you pay
duty also on what the appraiser thinks the
cost of production should have been and
also what the profit should have been. In
other words, you do not know on what basis
you are going to pay duty.
Now, that is a simple illustration of what
is going to happen in the larger field in regard
to goods coming into Canada. As I said at
the beginning, honourable senators, this bill
strikes at the very root of the principle
that powers of taxation remain in the hands
of Parliament. And from a practical point
of view it is bound, at a time when all other
nations are proposing to reduce their tariffs
in order to develop trade, to increase our
tariffs against countries, and this will eut into
our trade. I say honourable senators, not only
should the bill have been brought forward
at a more appropriate time for discussion in
this house, but it should not be brought forward at such an inappropriate time as now
when we are almost on the eve of a commonwealth conference on trade.
Hon. R. B. Horner: Honourable senators,
I want to make just a few remarks. I have
no fault to find with the complaint of the
Leader of the Opposition (Hon. Mr. Macdonald), about bringing this legislation to
the house on the last day of the session. But
I do want to complain, and I think most
justly, that it was clearly unfair of him to
refer back to the Bennett administration in
the 1930's and to suggest that present conditions are similar to those that existed then.
Honourable senators, I want to protest as
strongly as I can against any such suggestion and to state that had we not had a
man of the Right Honourable Mr. Bennett's
ability at that time our institutions might
not have remained sound down through the
years. That they have done so was largely
because of the foresight and ability of the
late Lord Bennett. For the Leader of the
Opposition to refer to a time when every
country in the world was raising tariffs is,
I think, unfair. Even now you have got to
be in a position to be able to bargain. If

SEPTEMBER 6, 1958
you have no base to start with, how can
you reduce your tarif' in order to attract
trade?
Honourable senators, I rose merely to protest. I believe that the honourable Leader
of the Opposition, who is generally fair, will
regret having made his remark as to what
took place in the 1930's.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I hope I said nothing
against the late Right Honourable R. B. Bennett with respect to his ability and sincerity.
I had a great respect for him, but I did
not approve of those policies which he put
into effect. I do not think any fairminded
person can come to any other conclusion
than that they were not in the best interest
of the country.
Hon. Mr. Horner: They were quite unavoidable on that occasion.
Hon. T. A. Crerar: Honourable senators
this bill which was explained at considerable length by our colleague from Ottawa
East (Hon. Mr. Choquette) certainly cannot
be regarded as a minor or unimportant measure. The honourable senator who introduced
it made quite a lengthy explanation. He
described the routine of appeals and all this
sort of thing but he did not touch in the
remotest way on the fundamental principle
embedded in this legislation.
The bill is a very important bill. It may
be, and many will agree with my statement,
than in its underlying principle it is the most
important bill that bas come to this house
this session.
Hon. Mr. Burchill: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: And why do I say this?
Because it provides that power hitherto exercised only by Parliament can be exercised
under certain conditions by the Governor
in Council. That is implicit in this legislation. There can be no question about it. Section 39, the proposed new section to safeguard
against dumping, is away beyond anything
we have ever had in our law in the past
in that respect, excepting possibly the measure that was introduced during the late
Lord Bennett's régime.
Hon. Mr. Bruni: May I ask the honourable
senator just one question, and I am asking
it for information. Does he know of any
state whereby anti-dumping legislation can
be enforced? I am just asking this question
for information. I have been sitting here
thinking of how Parliament could administer
anti-dumping legislation.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: Well, we had dumping
legislation in this country since 1898, when
it was first introduced, and the principle upon
which it was introduced governed the application of the law for almost 25 years. This is

not a new thing. Of course this anti-dumping
principle, I am bound to say, was invoked
by the Liberal administration as well.
The first departure in that respect was
made in 1922 when the late Mr. Motherwell
who was Minister of Agriculture in the new
administration that came into being after
the election of 1921 and who, by the way,
was a militant freetrader in Saskatchewan,
fell under the spell-and how capable some
people are of exercising their spells-of certain fruit and vegetable men. He introduced,
or had the Government introduce, a provision that on fruits and vegetables, for a
limited time in the year, the Governor in
Council could fix valuation for duty purposes; but it was only a very limited application, and for a limited time.
If I may make a confession, I was a member of the House of Commons at that time;
my honourable colleague from Gulf (Hon.
Mr. Power) was also there.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Did not the honourable
senator a few years ago introduce a similar
measure in this house, or vote for it, giving
assistance to the textile industry? I remember speaking on it and accusing him of
changing his ideas from free trade to protection. I will look up the reference.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: Had my honourable friend
possessed his soul in patience for a few
moments longer, I would have arrived at
that point. I recall speaking in 1922 against
that legislation. And since one's memory is
always fallible, I took occasion to look up
the Hansard of that debate. I found that the
most searing denunciation of the principle
came from the Right Honourable Arthur
Meighen, who was then leading the Conservative party in the House of Commons.
If my honourable friend the Leader of the
Government (Hon. Mr. Aseltine) wants to get
some ideas of what effective leadership is,
I would commend him to read that debate.
Then came 1930, and a similar provision
was placed in the law by the Bennett administration. That remained in the law. It
was there when the first trade agreement
was negotiated with the United States-I
believe it was signed early in January, 1936and an undertaking was given by Canada
to the United States that that provision
would not apply against their goods coming
into Canada under the agreement. The law
remained there; it was never invoked, and
it was finally eliminated during the proceedings leading up to the GATT treaties. That
is briefly the history, honourable senators.
There are one or two other exceptions; there
is the one my honourable friend mentioned.
I don't care whether a proposal of this kind

SENATE
comes from a Liberal Government or a Conservative Government, it is unsound in
principle.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: We don't live in a freetrade world.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: A free-trade world has
nothing whatever to do with it. The principle
is this: is Parliament to be supreme, or is its
power to be gradually whittled away and
centered in the executive? It is that principle
which for a few minutes today I wish to discuss. I am not going to discuss the effect
these changes may have on our trade. I am
afraid they may be serious in this respect, that
at a time when the world, the Western world
at any rate, seems ta be moving to a freer
trade among themselves, we are sort of indirectly serving notice on them that we are
going to look after our own commerce.
But my specific objection to this legislation,
let me repeat, is the principle implicit in it,
and which was not discussed by the honourable senator who sponsored the bill. My
objection is that in substantial measure it
takes from Parliament the inherent power of
taxing, and centres it in the executive, or
gives the executive the power to operate it.
That cannot be denied.
Hon. Mr. Bruni: Would the honourable
senatorHon. Mr. Crerar: Perhaps my versatile
friend from Hanover (Hon. Mr. Brunt) can
do it.
Hon. Mr. Bruni: I am still your friend.
Would the honourable senator support the
legislation if it was being enforced by Parliament rather than by the Governor in Council?
Hon. Mr. Crerar: My point is this: if the
textile industry needs more protection-and
personally I do not favour it, though I may be
wrong -let the Government bring in an
amendment to the Customs Tariff, and let
everyone see it, and Parliament will be exercising its power. But in this legislation everything comes under this arbitrary power. For
instance, agricultural implements come into
this country free of duty, but if the minister
is satisfied that material injury has been
caused or may be caused-indeed, if he suspects it may be caused-this section 39 may
be invoked to put a duty on agricultural implements. My honourable friend will not deny
that-he can't deny it.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: I don't agree with that.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: In other words, on the
whole range of imports into this country,
irrespective of what they may be, section 39
can be made to apply. That is a centralizing
of power in the executive that is unparalleled
in the history of this country.

There is today, or has been, a good deal of
criticism from time to time about Parliament
losing its authority. A feeling has been developing in this country that Parliament
counts for very little and that the real source
of power is the cabinet. Now, that is dangerous.
I am bound to say that the Prime Minister
has on miany occasions spoken of this tendency
and thi, danger. No one spoke more loudly
against the degradation of Parliament, against
the whittling away-those were the words
used-of the powers of Parliament, than did
the Prime Minister prior to the election in
1957. I have not the slightest doubt that some
of my honourable friends opposite, who may
have taken part in that election, also
emphasized that.
I say now quite frankly, that there has been
a loss of respect for Parliament in this country. I say quite honestly also, I was one who
hoped that the Prime Minister, when he
came to office, would be able to stem that
and restore the authority and prestige of
Parliament as it had been in the old days.
But what do we get? We get this Bill C-51
brought in in the dying days of the session,
sponsored by a Government that denounced
time and again the whittling away of the
authority of Parliament.
This bill, obviously, is one which should
not be brought to us at the end of the session.
In the Speech from the Throne, nearly four
months ago, announcement was made that it
was to be introduced. Time passed; the Government did not introduce it, although it was
on the Order Paper for weeks, even months.
As my honourable leader (Hon. Mr. Macdonald) asked, why was it not introduced
and passed in the other house, so that we
could have had it before us, could have sent
it to committee, could have examined the
reasons why, and heard the minister in the
committee? What happened? It was brought
into the Commons a few days ago, was discussed, though not for a long period, and
comes to us at 10.30 of the clock on the
morning of the day on which Parliament is
expected to prorogue. It is said that the
Senate could continue to sit. That is true.
We could keep Parliament in session, and I
am not sure that we should not do so and
deal with this measure properly.
I wish to register my protest against the
present procedure. If the bill was more or
less of the type of inconsequential legislation, not very important in principle, not
requiring from Parliament a great deal of
concentrated attention, there would be no
objection to the bill being brought in on the
last day and then expedited, if it was desired
to conclude the sessional work. But this is a
bill which could fundamentally alter the
whole basis of the application of our tariff.

SEPTEMBER 6. 1958
That being so, it is important legislation, and
should not be thrown at this house in the
last hours of the session. We cannot send it
to a committee, though if there ever was a
bill which has come before us this year that
should have gone to committee for scrutiny,
this is it.
I do not like the present method of conducting our affairs. It was said by the gentleman who, over 90 years ago, gave us our
constitution, that the Senate was to be a
place for reflection, that here we should take
a sober second look. These were the words,
may I remind my honourable friends opposite,
of their great leader, Sir John A. Macdonald.
Here, it was said, we were free from the
contentions of the Commons. Here we could
exercise an objective approach to legislation,
and consider it in the calmness and serenity
of this environment. To send this bill here
at this hour makes a complete travesty of
what was intended by the Fathers of our
Constitution-a complete travesty. Where, in
this matter, are we going to end?
I do not know how far the Government
may apply the new powers which are conferred on it under section 39. I hope it will
use them very sparingly indeed. But, as I
survey the events of the last few years, when
I take notice of the Government's course
since it came into power, I am bound to say
that I have no great faith that it will exercise
discretion and judgment and fairness in the
operation of the extensive powers which are
created for it by this legislation, and which,
I maintain, are in principle wholly wrong.
[Later:]
Hon. Mr. Crerar: Honourable senators, I
wish to correct an error in the remarks I
made before we adjourned for lunch.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: It is an unusual
occurrence for the honourable gentleman
from Churchill to have made an error.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: I concur.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: It is very kind of the
honourable leaders to make that observation.
The bill is an involved and complex one. This
morning I stated that the powers under
section 39 could extend to the fixing of duties
on goods that are now free. I was incorrect
in that. Duty-free goods cannot be affected
by this legislation, because what this legislation does is to give power to fix valuations,
not to establish new rates of duty. Being a
very modest individual and always desirous
of being right in the statements I make to
the house, I wish now to make that correction. I do think, along with honourable
senators, that we had a very short time to try
and master the purpose of a very complex
bill.

Hon. Mr. Aseltine: You cannot make
another speech now.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: You can be generous
the last day.
Hon. Mr. Horner: Oh, yes, go right along.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: If I can get a chance to
resume, I will say that that is the explanation
for my failure to thoroughly grasp this point.
Hon. William M. Wall: Honourable senators,
on a point of information: I shall be speaking
for about half an hour, and I do not know
what the order of debate is to be.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Go ahead.
Hon. Mr. Wall: Honourable senators, it is
not my purpose or intention to delay the
passing of this very important bill which the
Government appears determined, shall I say,
to rush through, at this late stage, as the
honourable Leader of the Opposition (Hon.
Mr. Macdonald) bas said, at the twelfth hour
of the terminal dying days of the current
session. But having said this, I feel that I
must not default upon what I consider to
be my obligation to make certain observations
and to ask certain questions, the answers to
which will enable me to clarify my thinking.
For I must admit, sincerely and candidly,
that I need further explanations concerning
the basic purpose or, shall I say, the primary
Governmental intent with respect to this bill,
and I need additional indications of exactly
how it is supposed to work in actual practice.
As I picked my way through a veritable
forest of carefully collated words, which I
received this morning but which I had read
previously, all very expertly drafted in
legalese terminology, and not being an expert
on tariff schedules or tariff valuations, I tried
to search for basic meanings and purposes. I
asked myself, for example, what the new
or additional administrative powers vis-à-vis
valuation for duty purposes mean exactly,
and how the residual, last resort powers to
do just that under the present act do not meet
our emerging needs-to prevent, as I understand it, discriminatory and injurious
dumping practices by our international trade
partners. I asked myself whether there is
any danger that the changes in valuation
principles might conceivably reintroduce into
our customs administration the flavour of
selective and even punitive discrimination. I
asked myself, as did the honourable Leader of
the Opposition (Hon. Mr. Macdonald), what
effect the administration of these new powers
is likely to have upon trade. I asked myself
if there was something that was left unsaid
in this legislation and if indeed we were
interested in protecting the textile industry
and, if so, whether that should not have been
done by amendments to the Customs Tariff

SENATE

Act, as was stated by the honourable senator
from Churchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar).
So I went for guidance to experts, and I
searched for guidance by reading a very
current authoritative essay in tariff technology entitled Customs Administration in
Canada, written by Professor Gordon Blake.
The essential basic character of the present
bill deals with valuation, and Professor Blake
devotes the whole of chapter 8 of his essay
to this subject. On page 94 he writes:
The fundamental problem of customs administration in Canada is unquestionably valuation, and its
consequences are felt in all sections of the economic
community which come into contact with the tariff
itself.

Further on he states:
It is true that for the most part the provisions
go to the market place in search for this value,
but the care that is taken to describe and circumscribe the market indicates that what is really being
attempted is the legal determination of price.

I do not propose a statutory determination
of price, but as one reads the bill one wonders
what is meant by the arbitrary discrimination
of price that will be in effect under ministerial jurisdiction, subject to no appeal. It
is true, as was mentioned by the sponsor, that
from the days of Confederation valuation for
duty has been essentially based upon the concept of the fair market value thereof in
the principal markets of the world whence
the same were exported directly to Canada.
It is also true, as the honourable gentleman
from Churchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar) has stated,
that in the 1920's and again in the 1930's this
basic concept was diluted or abridged and
we had changes and, as this treatise says, in
the 1930's this concept was revised in order
to define the market more precisely and to
introduce a new cost of production criterion,
which is exactly what we are dealing with
now.

Then the author discusses anti-dumping
practices and the law. This is the opinion of
an expert who has given a lot of thought to
these problems. Dealing with changes to this
cost of production plus profits concept, which
is now being introduced, the author states,
on page 99:
An enormous increase in the power of the
Minister of National Revenue over the tarif, and
a concomitant decline in the power of Parliament,
resulted from the legislation of 1930.

Then it says:
These several provisions of the Customs Act,
along with the one section of the Customs Tariff
Act, when viewed as they stood in 1933, represent
the high point of administrative protectionism in
Canadian economic history. Since that time there
has been a slow return to some kind of "normalcy,"
with a gradual whittling away of those features
which have been most difficult to defend in the
light of Canada's position as a trading nation.

In view of this expert historical verdict,
I then read the House of Commons Debates
and I strove especially to arrive at future
implications of this amending legislation. I
attempted to ascertain this from the minister's brief statement on second reading, which
has been supplemented very well by the remarks of the sponsor of the bill (Hon. Mr.
Choquette) in the Senate this morning. But
as I read the minister's statement I was quite
frankly lulled into a kind of semi-mesmerized
state of acquiescence. For what did the minister say? He said there was want of certainty
as to the true meaning of some phrases, and
that there was a need for clarifying and
rendering beyond question the meaning of
the provisions which have been given difficulty, and that the cardinal principle of
valuation which has been in effect since
Confederation, and which is to continue to
apply, is to continue to be based upon the
fair market value. But when I read the carefully drafted phrases in the bill itself, and
when I noted the new sections 36, 37, 38, 39, 40
and 40A, my feeling of security began to be
racked by serious doubts, and I fell prey to
feelings of consternation and fear-fear of
what appears to be left unsaid and therefore
unknown. What real purposes, I asked myself, are to be attained by some of the provisions in this bill? Note what the minister's
statement would have me believe: that there
was a want of certainty, that there was a need
for clarification of meaning and the need to
regroup certain items. It is all ostensibly so
simple and so lullingly sweet in its apparent
reasonableness and historical continuity, and
yet all my formative learning and former
experiences during the late twenties and early
thirties were, I must admit. frankly oriented
to freer trade and toward lowering trade
barriers.
All these things prodded me into a state of
alertness to danger, especially when I note
that valuation practices are to become more
subject to administrative action which is to
me the fruit of procedures and measurements,
which simply cannot be subjected to any valid
workable objective assessment. It is this
alerted uncertainty which prompts me to
plead for further explanations, and I am
going to pose to the honourable sponsor of
the bill a series of questions as I go along.
These questions I feel I must ask so that I
may the better understand exactly what the
bill means, what it is supposed to do, what
present difficulties it is supposed to overcome
that the present act cannot cope with, and
exactly for what specific purposes it is supposed to be used, as together we face the
problem of increasing both our export and
our import trade, especially with our trading
partners of the free world, and most especially

SEPTEMBER 6, 1958
with our trading partners of the commonwealth. This alertness to uncertainty about
intent and eventual practices bringing perhaps
a larger measure of unwarranted and undesirable protectionism was aggravated when
I referred to the budget speech of the Minister of Finance. I do not want to quote from
his speech now, but he intimated that changes
had to be made in valuation provisions and
that Canada was going to adopt, where appropriate, the principle that the value
for duty of imported goods shall not be less
than the cost of production, plus a reasonable
advance for selling costs and profit.
Now, before I pose the questions which
perturb me and distress me, let me hasten
to add that I recognize the good points of
this amending legislation. I am not an expert
on appeals, and I notice the honourable
Leader of the Opposition (Hon. Mr. Macdonald) made reference to the laborious way
in which appeals have to be lodged, and to
the fact that therefore appeals are not lodged
as often as might be expected. But if the bill,
I believe under section 2, straightens out the
appeal procedures and makes them better,
well, certainly I am the last one in the world
to feel that should not be done. I notice that
one of the sections dealing with appeals concerns salacious literature, and I hope that this
little beginning will help with what is a
serious but a different problem of very deep
concern to many Canadians.
Now the questions:
In what respects, I would humbly ask, does
the present act in its statutory and attendant
regulatory provisions fail to meet adequately
our emergent problems with respect to unfair
and discriminatory dumping practices? Has a
case been made to this house that the present
act does not function well in that regard?
Section 38(1) now provides certain arbitrary
powers for arriving at an estimated fair
market value. So, I ask, has a case been
made for amending this present legislation
on the basis of proven and documented inadequacies of this legislation with a view, as
I see it, of extending by the new act the
privileges of the minister and of the executive
to fix values for import duty purposes?
Further, has a case been made to prove
to us the present necessity of making changes
which could be interpreted as a violation of
our international commitments under GATT,
to which we are a signatory, and whose importance need not be documented here?
Would, therefore, the sponsor of the bill
assure this chamber that the changes in the
bill, setting up what in effect are alternative
and not residual or last resort statutory validated administrative powers, based on the
concept of cost of production, plus gross profit,

are not contrary to our solemn obligations
to which we subscribe under GATT?
I do not want to talk about the preamble
of GATT. I do want to point out that articles
VI and VII of GATT established the principle of fair market valuation, and that article
XIX permits arbitrary valuation for exceptional purposes only; and I want to point out
that on December 16, 1953 the former Prime
Minister of Canada, the Right Honourable
Louis St. Laurent, as reported on page 976
of Hansard in the other place, said:
Our interpretation of our obligation under GATT
is that we cannot resort to the cost of production
price if there is another way of determining what
is the fair market value. It is only when we are
prevented from using other ways of determining
the fair market value that we feel that under GATT
we can resort to investigation of the cost of
production.

Now I should like to return to the considered statement of Professor Blake, given
on page 110 of his study, where he says:
This cost of production basis for valuation is not
specifically acknowledged as valid by Article 7 of
the agreement.

That is the GATT agreement.
It is in fact not mentioned at ail. However.
in the Customs Act as revised this basis of valuation has been relegated to a minor position.

My contention is, if I may digress, that
this basis of valuation according to cost of
production, plus profit, is not now being relegated to a minor, subsidiary, residual, or last
resort position. The author continues:
It is one thing to prescribe the cost of production criterion as a residual method of finding value
after other means have failed. It is quite another
to retain it as an overriding criterion of fair
market value. The wording of the old section 36
provided that the value for duty shall In no case
be less than the actual cost of production of similar
goods, . . .

So I would plead with the honourable
sponsor of the bill: can he give us some
other authoritative statements which will
substantiate the opposite opinion that in
fact the present bill does not abridge or does
not contravene the GATT agreement?
Further, would the sponsor of the bill
reassure this honourable house about the
far-reaching powers contained in sections 37,
38, 39, and 4 0A( 7 ) (c) especially? Honourable senators will notice the basic clause
dealing with valuation for duty, section 36,
is subject to section 38. And section 37 says,
"subject to section 38". In other words, all
those clauses appear to be subsidiary to or
in a different position than section 36, which
should be a primary section.
Can the sponsor of the bill assure us that
sections 37, 38, 39, and 40A(7) (c) especially

SENATE
are to be used only in rare and exceptional
cases, in a residual and last-resort manner
and not as a regular alternative, which presumption or assumption-take your choicemay be made as one reads the pertinent
clauses of the amending bill, and I am not
going to read them at this point?
Further, would the sponsor of the bill
define in more or less categorical terms what
is meant by "cost of production", by "reasonable margin of profit", explaining more or
less specifically what realistic and tested
procedures are to be used in arriving at
reasonably objective measurement standards
which may be subjected to the test of fairness and equity?
In this connection the honourable senator
told us and assured us that this adjudicated measurement is to be obtained from
the producers or manufacturers where such
goods originate.

We welcome this assurance

Hon. Mr. Dupuis: May I ask the honourable
gentleman, is it not to be understood that
dumping is the selling of surplus goods by
the country of their origin in foreign countries, particularly in Canada, at a lower price
than it costs to purchase them in the country
of origin?
Hon. Mr. Wall: I would say yes, but I am
asking myself that question because of the
fact that I am not clear as to the intent of the
provisions in section 39 of the present bill.
I am just cogitating, as it were. If I may
continue:
Its acceptance has been validated by articles
VI and VII of the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade, with a protective lastresort escape clause for use in exceptional
cases. This is article XIX, which permits
arbitrary valuation to meet exceptional and
abnormal trade situations. The experience of
time has cemented my belief that tariff s should
be imposed on values which reflect actual
market prices which can be decided by
assessing what is a fair market value in the
country where such products and goods
originate.
The fairness of such market values may be
adjudicated by reference to the values on the
principal markets in the country or countries
of origin. These prices are matters of public
record-store prices, prices advertised in
newspapers. These prices may be verified by
our customs officials and can be subjected to
the test of fact. In case of dispute one can
find objective validation for these facts for
appeal procedures.
It appears that this basic and accepted principle of fair market valuation is being undermined and diluted by the present amending
legislation.
The latter definition, to which the present
Government apparently subscribes, if not
overtly then indirectly, may have something
to do with the arbitrary valuation features of
the present bill, and I should like to refer
to rather significant statements of Government policy which give us some clues to
what may be the basic principles we are
dealing with in the amendments to the
Customs Act, and I ask myself how am I to
interpret the Government's basic intentions
when I read these statements in the Budget
Speech. I quote:

and we appreciate his further assurance
that this information will be ascertained and
collated so that it may be subjected, if I
understand him correctly, to the test of fact
by those who may feel unjustly treated.
I trust I am correct in this, because the
answer to this very practical question would
enable me to judge more adequately whether
these concepts of the cost of production and
reasonable gross profit add to or detract
from the principle involved in this legislation.
I have in my hand an article by Grant
Dexter of the Winnipeg Free Press, which I
shall not read, in which he tries to assess the
practical explanations of this test for cost of
production plus fair profit as a criterion for
dutiable values, and he gets himself into a
state of mental indigestion wondering how
all this is going to work.
I do not like to digress but I do want to
say this, that it appears that once again we
are fighting the battle of two opposing concepts of dumping. We seem to be at grips
with a basic controversy which has a history
of over half a century.
What exactly is dumping? I ask myself these
questions: Is it the sale in Canada of goods
and products imported at a price lower than
the fair market value in the country from
which these goods or products came, or is it
the sale in Canada of goods and products at
a price lower than the cost of production plus
The present dumping duty section of the Custom

the Customs Act are adequate to deal with some

Is there any justification for my fears, and
the fears of many other Canadians, that the
valuation component of the tariff, which is a
tax, is, in part, being taken away from Parliament and being vested in the Governor in
Council, the minister, and finally the customs
department? Would it be true to infer that
the amount of the cost of production, plus
the selling costs and profit, may be what a
customs auditor or other official declared it
to be, giving such officials a discretion not possible if the test were fair market value determined on the open markets of public record?
Have I any cause for alarm that tariff protection could become a favour to be granted by
Government at its discretion, and not by
statute to be enacted by Parliament, the practical application of whose statutory provisions
could be and would be subjected to public
examination, public review and adjudication
by the Tariff Board?
I note what the honourable Leader of the
Opposition (Hon. Mr Macdonald) had to say,
and I paraphrase his remarks: No one can
deny that the powers to fix duties-and duties
are a tax-are being placed in the hands of
the minister and cabinet, and by this token
are taken away from Parliament itself.

Canadian. Indeed, I was not going to disclose

the present bill makes no similar exemption,

this question further.
Would the sponsor of the bill give additional information to this chamber so that I,
for one, may know more about the historical
background of legislative changes which may
be akin to this one? We have, apparently,
tried before this kind of semi-arbitrary and
partly ad hoc administrative valuation based
upon the rather intangible and largely unmeasurable principle of cost of production,
plus reasonable margin of profit. My under-

standing is that the overall results of these
experiments in larger measures of protectionism were not particularly equitable or desirable. Now, perhaps there are valid data to
disprove this expert verdict.
I now wish to quote from the textbook
Tari/f Procedures and Trade Barriers, by

G. A. Elliott, beginning at page 187, and
dealing with the former historical experiment
in this cost of production, plus reasonable

profit formula. The author states:

statutory rate is being applied?
I refer honourable

senators again to the

SENATE
senators. I refer to the Right Honourable
Arthur Meighen, on an occasion when he
objected to an amendment to the Customs Act
authorizing the Government to fix arbitrary
valuations for duty purposes on a few natural
products, chiefly fresh fruits and vegetables.
On that occasion, long ago, he said:
There should never be an unrestrained discretion
in the hands of any minister or any Government.
There should be some principle laid down by the
house by which the Government must abide, and
beyond which they cannot go. That is sound, sensible
legislation. That is the protective principle democratically and fairly applied. What is proposed here
is the protective principle autocratically and
perhaps unfairly applied. This is protectionism
personified.

And later:
For the purposes of valuation, the minister can
fix the value where he likes, on any principle he
likes, to suit any interest he likes . . . as high as
he likes, and when he likes. In a word, this simply
puts into the power of the minister the whole
elevation of the tariff of this country.

I am afraid that perhaps something like
that may be happening now. I am perturbed
by fear and by uncertainty. May I request
the honourable senator who introduced this
bill, or indeed any other honourable senator
who can shed further light upon this apparently controversial problem area, to explain
to me so that the uncertainties I voiced
through the medium of my questions may be
clarified, and so that I may be persuaded that
all these amendments will bring to the welfare of the Canadian people the beneficial
contributions which will justify acceptance

of this significant piece of legislation?
Because the application of this legislation
is national and general, rather than regional,
can I get further elucidation to enable me to
judge how the amendments, especially those
affecting valuation procedures in order to
arrive at some objective measurement of
dutiable value, will affect the economic wellbeing of the average citizen of-and because

Hon. Mr. Burchill: All I want to do is to
say a few words on this bill before it is
passed.
At 1.20 p.m. the sitting was adjourned.
At 3 p.m. the sitting was resumed.
Hon. G. Percival Burchill: Honourable senators, I have just one or two observations to
make on this bill. First of all, I thoroughly
agree with the honourable leader on this side
(Hon. Mr. Macdonald) that this is one of the
most important pieces of legislation to come
before the Senate during this session.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: Are they not all
important?
Hon. Mr. Burchill: Some are more important than others, and I share my honourable
leader's regret that we were not afforded an
opportunity to give the bill the study it
merits. Although I am a member of the
Senate I want to pay tribute to our standing
committees, which I think have done a grand
job on legislation that has come to them
from the House of Commons.
Hon. Mr. Bruni: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Burchill: I do not think the Senate need be at all ashamed of its performance, particularly in committee. Some excellent speeches have been delivered in this
chamber, speeches that the people of Canada
should know more about. However, I wish
to make particular reference to the good
work done by the Standing Committee on
Banking and Commerce and the Standing
Committee on Transport and Communications.
Honourable senators, what I want to say
about this measure is that if there is any
one lifeline upon which the economic life
of Canada depends at this time, in my judgment it is on our export trade. If Canada
faces any economic danger today it is that
of pricing our export goods above those of
world levels. As a manufacturer and an
exporter, one who is employing Canadians
in the export of manufactured Canadian
articles, I speak whereof I know. It is a
real struggle today to manufacture articles
and produce them in the face of world competition. World trade is not a one-way
street, it is a two-way street, and if we
want to sell our goods we also have to be
prepared to buy from other countries. Before
I deal more specifically with that point I
would warn the Senate that Canada faces
the threat of an invasion, not of bombs and
shells, but an economic invasion of lowpriced goods from European countries. Do
not let anybody run away with the idea that

SEPTEMBER 6, 1958
European merchants cannot produce satisfactory goods more cheaply than we can in
Canada.
I dare say his Honour the Speaker, who
has just returned from the World's Fair at
Brussels, will support me in this statement.
He has seen, although he has not told me
so, as others who attended the Brussels Exposition have told me they saw, what is
being produced in Europe and will be offered
in the world markets-of which, Canadians,
please take note. I think that in Canada
we must consider ways and means of producing goods in such a way and at such a
price that we can sell them in the markets
of the world. Let us never forget that, because while some countries today are suffering from a scarcity of goods of the kind
that people need, and which make a nation
prosperous, Canada is suffering from an
abundance of those goods. I do not know
which is worse. There is a surplus of wheat
in the west, we have too much newsprint,
too many base metals; we have too much
lumber in New Brunswick, too much coal
in Nova Scotia, and too many potatoes in
Prince Edward Island. The problem before
us today is to find markets to dispose of these
goods. Any measure passed by Parliament
which stops or restricts the flow of trade on
that two-way street may be regarded as
vicious legislation.
If Canadian manufacturers are not sufficiently protected against
dumping by the legislation which is already
on the statute books, then God help the army
of consumers in this country, of which I am
one, if they require a measure of this kind to
protect them. I speak as one of those consumers from a province that has to buy from
and pay through the nose to the Canadian
manufacturers for everything we consume.
For these reasons, honourable senators, I
am opposed to this legislation.
Hon. W. M. Aseltine: Honourable senators,
I intend to make only a few remarks in
connection with this bill.
I hope there was no suggestion in the
remarks made by the honourable Leader of
the Opposition (Hon. Mr. Macdonald) this
morning that I have been holding back legislation and trying to rush it through at
the last moment.

and I hope I have had some success. We have
referred many measures to our committees,
which have done valuable work, as bas just
been said, and I have tried at all times to
see that there was opportunity for ample
consideration. I would like to say that in
the nearly 25 years I have been a member
of this house I cannot remember any occasion when some important legislation did not
remain to be dealt with in the dying moments
of the session.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Just the Appropriation Bill.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Honourable senators,
all legislation is important. My attention has
just been called to the fact that the Combines Investigation Bill was brought in on
the last day of the session in 1951. I am
quite sure, honourable senators, that if you
will look back, you will findHon. Mr. Macdonald: We will agree-once
every seven years.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: Well, we won't deal any
more with that.
Honourable senators, I would just like to
say that this measure was forecast in the
Speech from the Throne. It was on the
Order Paper in the other place for more
than a month, and the bill bas been in the
hands of senators for some time. Therefore
we can hardly say that we have been
taken greatly by surprise. I do not intend
to speak at any great length. I would point
out that the bill is intended to implement
the policy announced during the last election and later on in the Speech from the
Throne. It was designed principally to deal
with dumping, which cannot be dealt with
by an amendment to the Customs Tariff. At
any rate, I do not see how it could be
successfully handled in that way, or it
would have been done in that manner.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: May I observe that it
has been handled for 25 years in this country
in that way?
Hon. Mr. Bruni: Just on specific items.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Satisfactory dumping
legislation requires that action be taken very
quickly in order for it to be effective. I think
honourable senators will agree with that

go that far.
Suppose, for example, a manufacturer in the

SENATE
the sale of his first 400,000 pairs he will make
a good profit on the whole transaction. What,
then, does he do with the other 100,000 pairs
of shoes? He probably sends half of them
to England, maybe sending the other half
to Canada, where he expects them to be sold
at about $5 a pair, although manufacturing
cost was $10 a pair and he was selling them
in the United States at $15. What are we
going to do to handle that situation?
Hon. Mr. Crerar: They could not be imported into Canada under our existing
dumping law.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: As was suggested by
the honourable senator from Churchill (Hon.
Mr. Crerar), doesn't our present legislation
prevent importation of shoes under the
circumstances he has mentioned?
Hon. Mr. Aselline: I just used that as an
example of a commodity. I am not referring
to shoes exactly. It might be any article.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Well, the present
legislation provides for that.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: This legislation is not
necessary in the instance the honourable
Leader has given.
Hon. Mr. Asel±ine: Well, at any rate it will
not have any far-reaching effect on our trade.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I would remind the
Leader of the Government that legislation
which provides for that situation was opposed
by him when it was introduced in this house.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: I doubt that.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I am quite sure.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: I would have to have
concrete evidence of that.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Just read Hansard
and you will have it.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: I was just saying I
cannot see how this legislation will have any
far-reaching effect upon trade or that it is
intended to or will affect the British Preferential Tariff. The bill, moreover, provides
certain bargaining possibilities. I would like
to say this, that the Government will have
to stand or fall on this legislation. It is its
responsibility.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: We do not live in a free
trade world and I do not know how dumping
could be seriously controlled in any other
way.
That is all I have to say at the present
moment, honourable senators.

(Hon. Mr. Choquette) speaks again in this
debate his remarks will have the effect of
closing it.
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): Honourable senators, there were some questions that
were asked and I wonder whether if arising
out of the answers there are some remarks
that some of us might want to make. The
honourable senators who are interested might
make those remarks and then perhaps the
honourable senator from Ottawa East might
close the debate. Would that be satisfactory?
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, I would suggest that the honourable
senator from Ottawa East (Hon. Mr. Choquette) start by answering the questions put
by the honourable senator from Ottawa West
(Hon. Mr. Connolly) and the honourable
junior senator from Winnipeg (Hon. Mr.
Wall), to permit those honourable senators to
make additional remarks if they wish, and
he could then close the debate.
Hon. Mr. Choqueite: That is quite agreeable, honourable senators.
I will deal with the questions that were
asked in the same order as they were asked.
First were those asked by the honourable
senator from Ottawa West (Hon. Mr.
Connolly).
The first question was: "Is there any set
rule as to which test or rule must be applied
in the case of like goods and similar goods?"
The language of the statute indicates when
section 36 shall apply and when section 37
shall apply. If the goods are like goods, and
all the criteria are met, section 36 is to be

used. If the goods are not like goods but are
similar, the language of 37 requires its use.
This principle is in accordance with GATT:
like goods are to be valued at the home market
price, similar goods are to be valued at the
nearest ascertainable equivalent.
The second question put to me by the honourable senator concerns an explanation as to
lines 3 and 4 of section 4 0A(7) (c), page 6 of
the bill. Lines 3 and 4 were introduced in
1932 in pursuance of the provisions of fair
trade agreements concluded at the Imperial
Economic Conference and have been in the
law since that time. We are merely continuing
the provision, which is part of section 38 of
the present act.
I think those were the two questions put to
me by the honourable senator from Ottawa
West.
The honourable Leader of the Opposition
(Hon. Mr. Macdonald) asked two questions,
one referring to the proposed section 39, and
in particular the words, "Where the minister
Hon. Mr. Choquette: Honourable senators,is satisfied that material injury has been or
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, may be caused..." I think the honourable
if the honourable senator from Ottawa East senator took exception to the words "may be

SEPTEMBER 6, 1958
caused", because his contention was that it
would be difficult to decide when and whether
injury may be caused. This language was
taken from GATT, article VI, paragraph 5,
at page 12, which reads:
No contracting party shall levy any anti-dumping
or counterveiling duty on the importation of any
product of the territory of another contracting party
unless it determines that the effect of the dumping
or subsidization, as the case may be, is such as to
cause or threaten material injury to an established
domestic industry.

Hon. Mr. Macdonald: My point was as to
the procedure for arriving at the basis of
valuation in a case where injury may be
caused. That does not answer my question.
Hon. Mr. Choquette: I am sorry, I misunderstood the question.
The second question was with regard to
excluding British Preferential goods. The
answer is, if we were to exclude British
Preferential goods from the operation of section 39, we would be discriminating between
countries, which is contrary to the principles
of GATT.
The honourable junior senator from Winnipeg (Hon. Mr. Wall) asked a series of questions. The first question was, in what respect
is the present fair market value provisions of
the law inadequate to deal with anti-dumping
situations? The answer is that as long as
there is a market in the country of origin,
even though the value is below cost of production, it must be accepted under the present
law.
The next question was: Has a case been
made that this legislation does not constitute
a violation of GATT? The only answer I can
give is, that I understand that the responsible minister in another place, who had more
time and opportunity than I have had to
study this measure, has given assurance that
it is not incompatible with GATT in any
respect.
The next question was: Can assurance be
given that the far-reaching powers in sections
37, 38, 39 and 40A will be used only in rare
and exceptional cases? The answer is: I am
informed that upwards of 90 per cent of our
importations will be dealt with under sections
36 and 37, and it is expected that the extraordinary powers will affect only about 10 per
cent of our importations.
Hon. Mr. Wall: May I ask a supplementary
question: Is there any danger that the way
this residual 10 per cent provision is understood may have an enormous effect on the
manner in which the tariff is applied to the
remaining 90 per cent?
Hon. Mr. Choquette: So far as I know the
answer is "No". The rules to be applied really
become necessary when we are dealing with

goods manufactured in Iron Curtain countries
and other far-off countries.
The next question invited me to define
"cost of production". I suggest that we look
at section 35, subsection 2(b). In ordinary
language it means, I understand, material,
direct labour and factory overhead.
Hon. Mr. Wall: In the countries where the
goods are produced?
Hon. Mr. Choquette: Yes. A further question asks me to define "reasonable amount of
gross profit". This is answered by the section
itself, namely, gross profit generally earned
in the particular trade in the country of
export.
Another question was, what constitutes
dumping? Under the law, dumping duties are
applicable only to goods of a class or kind
made in Canada, for sale at less than the fair
market value or the value for duty purposes.
There was a further question: Section 4 0 A
(7) (c) exempts goods entitled to enter under
the British Preferential Tariff: why does not
the new section 39 contain the same provision? The answer is that to so legislate at
this time would be inconsistent with the nondiscriminatory provisions of GATT. I believe
I have already given that answer in reply to
a question by another honourable senator.
The last question was, would I give some
historical background of legislation similar to
the proposed section 39? The answer: Similar
legislation existed for a short period in 1921,
was reintroduced in 1930 and remained in
effect until 1948.
Hon. John J. Connolly (Ottawa West): Honourable senators, I have a few remarks to
make in connection with the question I
raised this morning about the rules to be
applied in determining how value is to be
ascertained. Section 35(2) of the present act
provides that the value for duty shall be the
fair market value of like goods when sold
in like quantities for home consumption in
the ordinary course of business under fully
competitive conditions, and so on.
Section 35(3) of the act provides that when
the value for duty cannot be determined
under subsection (2) for the reason that like
goods are not sold, then another rule applies.
Then section 35(4) of the Act provides that
where like goods are not sold in the manner described in subsections (2) or (3), then
the value for duty shall be determined as
subsection (4) prescribes.
Section 35(5) provides that where like
goods are not sold in the manner described in
subsections (2) or (3) or (4), then subsection
(5) applies. If subsection (5) does not cover the
situation, then the minister, under subsection
(6), may make a decision or a determination

SENATE
of value. There is another alternative provided
in subsection (7), based upon the cost of
production.
So under the existing legislation, as I understand it, the first rule that must be applied
is the fair market value rule in the country
of origin, and then you go down the line
until you get to the arbitrary provisions
empowering the minister to determine a
value in accordance with what he, in his discretion, might think is appropriate after suitable investigation. Thus there is a mutually
exclusive progression in the existing law.
When you come to this bill, as I read it,
section 36 provides an arrangement for the
determination of duty for "like" goods. Section 37 provides the rule for the determination of duty in respect to "similar" goods.
Section 38 deals with the determination of
duty in cases where goods are coming into
Canada and are going to be further processed
here, assembled or packaged or further
manufactured or intended to enter into the
course of manufacture in Canada.
I would draw the attention of honourable
senators to this language. In the case of goods
brought into this country in a semimanufactured condition or in a condition
which might require nothing more than
packaging, neither section 36 nor section 37
will apply but section 38 must apply because
section 36 provides that "subject to section
38," the value for duty shall be the fair
market value in the country of origin. Section 37 provides that "subject to section 38,"
the value of "similar" goods shall be as
prescribed therein.
So that when it comes to partially
manufactured goods to be assembled or
packaged or dealt with in that way in Canada,
section 38 will apply, and the concluding
words of that section of the bill are:
The value for duty shall be determined in such
manner as the Minister prescribes.

The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, I would remind the house that if the
honourable gentleman from Ottawa East
(Hon. Mr. Choquette) speaks now his remarks
will have the effect of closing the debate.
Hon. Mr. Choquette: Honourable senators,
I have nothing further to say except that
it has been a most interesting discussion and
I thank all those who have taken part. As
it is not likely this bill will be referred to
committee I would like to take this opportunity to thank the Deputy Minister (Customs and Excise), of the Department of National Revenue, who was most co-operative
in assisting me to answer some of the questions put to me this morning.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, the question is on the motion of the
Honourable Senator Choquette, seconded by
the Honourable Senator Brunt, that Bill C-51,

This bill also votes the
balance of the supplementary estimates
which were tabled on June 2, 1958, in the
amount of $52,957,874.66. When this bill is
passed the total amount of further supplementary estimates tabled in this house on
August 30, 1958, and of which honourable
members have had a copy for some time,

Appropriation Bill No. 5, $1,898,604,644.89.
This is the summary of what is contained in
section 2 of the bill.
The bill, honourable senators, follows the
same form as the one which we dealt with
in connection with the 1957-58 expenditures,
and which was passed by this house earlier
this week, September 1, and which was in
the form approved and recommended by
honourable senators when Appropriation
Bill No. 2 was discussed.

leader permit a question? We have been
told about Acts Nos. 2, 3, 4 and 5. What

Hon. Mr. Aseltine: We never passed an
Appropriation Bill No. 1 that I know of.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Why is there an

No. 1 have been passed in the earlier session?
Hon. Mr. Bruni: I think so, in January of
this year.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: That was another
Parliament.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: These all have to do with
the year 1958. I will probably have that
explanation in a moment.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Do I understand, if
I may interrupt, that the total appropriations
would be the amounts voted in Acts Nos. 2,
3, and 4, plus the amount set forth in this
bill?
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Plus the statutory items.
I have a summary that I can give honourable
senators.
The main estimates as printed amounted
to $5,960,197,032.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: How much? Do I understand my honourable friend to say that the
main estimates amounted to $5,960,000,000?
Hon. Mr. Aselline: That is the figure I have
here.

The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators,
when shall this bill be read the second time?
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: I move the second reading of the bill now.
Honourable senators, this is a bill for
granting to Her Majesty certain sums of
money for the public service of the financial
year ending the 3lst of March 1959. When
this bill is passed it will be Appropriation
Act No. 5, 1958.
Honourable senators will recall that certain previous appropriation bills were passed
during this session.
Appropriation Act No. 2 granted interim
supply for the first two months of 1958-59
in the amount of $626,292,380.09. It voted
one-sixth of the main estimates, threequarters of three votes, one-half of five
votes, one-quarter of four votes, one-sixth
of nine votes, and one-twelfth of 21 votes,
totalling the figure I have just given.
Appropriation Act No. 3, which granted
interim supply for June and July, was in
the amount of $624,592,837.43. It voted onesixth of the main estimates, seven-twelfths
of two votes, one-sixth of four votes, onetwelfth of 14 votes, one-sixth of the supplementary estimates, and three-quarters of
four votes, and one-third of one vote, making the total I have just given.
Appropriation Act No. 4 granted interim
supply for August and September in the
amount of $615,999,671.59, and voted onesixth of the main estimates, five-twelfths of
three votes, one-quarter of four votes, onetwelfth of 15 votes, one sixth of the supplementary estimates and a further one-sixth
of two votes.
The total voted by those three appropriation acts amounts to $1,866,884,889.11.
Honourable senators, the present bill will
grant the balance of the main estimates for
1958 and 1959, less a reduction of $500,000
in vote 65, which had to do with expenses
in connection with immigrants.
It was
found that these expenses were less than
expected, so the amount was reduced by
Hon. Mr. Bruni: That is the total of the votes
$500,000, which means that the amount of and statutory payments.

SENATE
Hon. Mr. Aselline: In that amount are included items amounting to $2,343,052,587
which are statutory, leaving the total amount
to be voted $3,617,144,445.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: And in addition there
are the supplementary estimates.
Hon. Mr. Aseliine: I am coming to that
next. The supplementary estimates amount to
$85,724,062, and the further supplementary
estimates $63,121,027. If you add all those
together you get $3,765,989,534, from which
$500,000 was deducted in Committee of Supply because, as I previously stated, the cost
of looking after immigrants was less than
expected. So the total estimates, including the
main estimates and the statutory items and
the two supplementary estimates, come to
$6,109,042,121. As I said before, the total
amount to be voted by this bill is the $3,765
million-odd, less $500,000, making a net total
of $3,265,989,534.
Incidentally, the explanation given to me
in connection with Appropriation Act No. 1
is that it had to do with 1958, was passed
in the closing days of the last session and
related to the 1957-58 estimates.
May I refer to section 4? Honourable
senators will recall that the borrowing of $1
billion was authorized, but that only $400
million of that amount was raised by the
sale of new securities issued July 15 to
December 15 with interest at 22 per cent for
current financing. It is reasonable to expect
that the remaining authority of $600 million
will be insufficient to cover the sale of Canadian Savings Bonds, 1958 series, in October
of this year, and a possible increase in treasury
bills and other budgetary and non-budgetary requirements, so additional provisions
must be made accordingly. Therefore, section
4 of this bill provides that the Governor in
Council shall have power to raise a loan of $1
billion in addition to the $1 billion which
was voted previously.
That, honourable senators, is an explanation of the bill. If any questions are asked
I hope to be able to answer them.
Hon. W. Ross Macdonald: Honourable senators, we are entering upon a new procedure
in respect to the passage of this bill. I understand the other house is now considering a
bill in connection with the Citizenship Act.
Indeed, we are making history in this chamber
today. I do not believe it has ever happened
before that the final appropriation bill was
presented to this bouse for consideration before all other legislation had been presented.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: The only reason for that
being done, honourable senators, is to enable
this honourable body to get ahead with consideration of the Appropriation Bill while
waiting for the other bill. I understand it was

announced in the other house that prorogation
will probably take place at 8 o'clock this
evening. So, when the bill was sent over I
thought it advisable to go ahead with consideration of it. But if there is any real
objection the debate can be adjourned until
we have considered the Citizenship Bill.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: But the honourable
leader bas already explained the bill. He
now gives us the reason why it bas come
to this bouse, before the Citizenship Bill.
Can he also explain why the Appropriation
Bill was passed in the other bouse in advance
of the Citizenship Bill?
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: That is beyond me.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I should think so. It
is beyond me.
Hon. Mr. Bruni: We cannot alter the procedure of the other house.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: This, too, is something new-to pass the final Appropriation
Bill in either house before passing a measure
such as the Citizenship Bill. Honourable senators realize that the Citizenship Bill will
involve the expenditure of a certain sum of
money, and no doubt the money which will
be required in that connection is included
in this Appropriation Bill.
Hon. Mr. Power: Loose change!
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: So we are in the position of voting money in connection with legislation which has not been and may not be,
passed.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: If that bill should not
be passed we would not have to spend the
money.
Hon. Mr. Power: Parliament is voting the
Government too much.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Yes, we are giving
you too much money.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: It would remain in the
Consolidated Revenue Fund.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I know, but then why
should we inquire into expenditures required
under the Citizenship Bill? We are being
asked to vote money in connection with a
measure which, in its present form, may not
be on the statutes this year.
Hon. Mr. Aselitine: The point never occurred
to me and I do not suppose it occurred to
those in the other place.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I do not know whether
it occurred to those in the other place, but
certainly it occurs to me and it must have
been obvious to many honourable senators.
Why is the Citizenship Bill not before us?
Why was it not passed, instead of being held

SEPTEMBER 6, 1958
back until the last minute? It is an important
bill, but it is not before us so I shall say
no more on that subject. I merely reiterate
that this procedure is most unusual. I am
prepared to say that it never happened before. Probably my honourable friend opposite is happy to be the Leader of the Government this year while history of this kind is
being made.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: I will see it never happens again.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: The amount included
in the bill before us is a huge one; the figures
are astronomical. The Government has not
only established a new custom in connection
with the bringing in of appropriation bills,
but it has broken another record.
Hon. Mr. Bruni: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: The Government has
broken the $5 billion barrier and is now
into $6 billion.
Hon. Mr. Power: Seven.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: My honourable friend
says seven.
Hon. Mr. Power: It is going to borrow
another billion, so that makes seven.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I will say it is nine
billion, because a few months ago Parliament
gave it power to borrow another billion. That
raises it to seven billion; and now we are
granting another billion, which raises it to
eight billion.
Hon. Mr. Bruni: Where do you get the other
billion to make it nine?
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: My honourable friend
must be referring to the money for the Canada Savings Bonds.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: The Government will
get another billion from the Canada Savings
Bonds, but we should not concern ourselves
about that; it is going to put that in the bank.
Of course, honourable senators, it is going to
spend a billionHon. Mr. Aseltine:
money.

That is part of this

Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I don't know if it
is. Of course, the Government is going to
spend the $1 billion, probably to provide for
other issues that are coming due. It is not
included in this money at all, but it is to
provide for other bonds which are maturing.
As I say, the Government has broken another
record and has established an all-time high
of $6 billion in expenditures. At the same
time we have reached the former high figure
in the cost of living. As honourable senators
may know, the cost of living has been going
57075-4-51

up month by month and if it continues it
will reach a new all-time high at the end
of this month. I do not think any Government should be proud of this. In fact, I
shudder to think just what heights in expenditures and in the cost of living we are
heading for. We will, of course, do nothing
about this bill, but I am satisfied Canadians
generally are concerned about the two
matters I have just mentioned, the tremendous expenditures and the continual increase from month to month in the cost of
living. This is truly a serious matter. Just
what the Senate can do about it troubles me.
Next year we could re-establish the practice
of having the Standing Committee on Finance
examine Government expenditures and make
recommendations, but whether the Government would heed those recommendations I
do not know. The day of accounting is
coming. This year there is going to be a
deficit of from $500 million to $1 billion,
which will result in the borrowing of an
additional $1 billion to the $2 billion which
we have authorized, and it will represent
the $9 billion which I mentioned a minute
ago.

Bruni: That was my under-

Hon. Mr. Macdonald:
I doubt it very
much. In any event, here we are talking
lightly of billions of dollars which have to be
raised from the taxpayers, the citizens of
Canada. A billion dollars is a lot of money
in relation to a population of between 16
million and 17 million people. Do honourable
senators realize that Canada, with its population of 16 million or 17 million, is spending in one year over $6 billion? I can quite
understand why we are so serious about
this matter, for it concerns us all. I certainly
trust that during the recess the Government
will give careful consideration to the financial position in which the country finds itself. I am very pleased that Parliament has
sat continuously throughout the summer.
The Government of the day has serious responsibilities and important problems over
which to ponder. I do not like to recall the
date of June 10, 1957, but it was 10 days
after that date when the former administration resigned and it was not long before
Parliament was called into a short session.
Then at the end of January Parliament was
dissolved, another short interval ensued, and
Parliament reassembled on May 12, and has
been sitting almost continually since.

SENATE
Government
the
senators,
Honourable
requires time to sit down and take account
quietly of what is taking place in Canada and
the rest of the world. I think it is a good
thing that the Government will be free from
the necessity of attending Parliament from
day to day. I know that the Government
cannot give consideration to the serious
matters with which it is faced if it has to
be concerned with Parliament every day.
I say therefore, first, that I am very pleased
that we have sat through the summer
months; it has been trying, for we would
have liked to be home, enjoying a vacation,
but it would not have been good for the
country.
Honourable senators, we shall be leaving
here tonight, probably to reassemble some
time early in the New Year. I hope the
Government of the day will give very careful
consideration to the path which we must
take if our country is to continue to be
prosperous and remain on a sound financial
basis.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: Honourable senators, I
have some information with regard to the
Citizenship Bill which has just passed
through the other house. The provisions for
carrying out expenditures in connection with
the Citizenship Act are all included in the
main estimates, Schedule A, which were
prepared in January of this year and tabled
in May. No new expenditure is contemplated
by the Citizenship Bill, and therefore no
other expenditure will be in contemplation.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I must say that I
cannot agree whatsoever with the remarks
of the leader in this respect. The amendment to the Citizenship Act will change the
provisions of the act considerably with regard
to revocation of citizenship, and the expense
in that connection should be considerably
lower than under the present act.
Hon. Mr. Wall: Would the honourable
leader permit a question?
In view of the
fact that we now have the total of all the
appropriations for the current fiscal year,
amounting to $6.109 billion, would the leader
care to relate that to the total of the estimated revenues, so that I could get an idea
as to the kind of a deficit we now seem to
be facing?

have a deficit of $55 million this year. Has
provision been made for that in this total of
$6.109 billion?
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: No.
Hon. R. B. Horner: Honourable senators,
I wish to add a word in view of what the
Leader of the Opposition (Hon. Mr. Macdonald) said to the effect that every senator
should be very seriously alarmed about the
huge deficit. I am not particularly worried
about that, but I am concerned with the fact
that our population, now standing at over

17 million, will increase to 25 million or
more in a very few years. Canada is a vast
country, and there is an immense amount
of work to be done in its development.
Unfortunately, at every turn we find unemployed people who seek employment only

as long as it is suited to them, and if they
cannot get it they claim unemployment
insurance. I object very much to that, as
I did when unemployment insurance first
came into being. If we can persuade our
people, and particularly our young people,
to settle down to work when and where it is
needed we shall have nothing at all to fear
in this country.
Hon. Mr. Burchill: Honourable senators,
following the remarks of the senator from
Blaine Lake (Hon. Mr. Horner), may I ask
ti honourable Leader of the Government
(Hon. Mr. Aseltine) if in the supplementary
estimates which have been placed before us
this evening, there is included the amount of
$40 million to the wheat growers of Western

Canada?
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Yes, that is included
in the supplementary estimates.

SEPTEMBER 6, 1958
The Hon. the Speaker: Is it the honourable
gentleman's intention merely to answer the
question?
Hon. Mr. Bruni: Yes, Mr. Speaker, I shall
just answer the question.
The words are added to paragraph (f) of
section 10(1) for the purpose of impressing the
oath upon the applicant after he has been
granted citizenship. If the honourable senator
can suggest any other words that might create
a greater impression on the applicant, I
should like to hear them.
Hon. Mr. Wall: I think the words should
be taken out altogether. If the applicant has
subscribed to the oath, that should be the end
of it. Surely the oath would not be taken by a
person unless he intended to comply with it.
Hon. Mr. Bruni: I think any words which
would impress the oath upon a naturalized
Canadian citizen should be added.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: They never read it.
Hon. Mr. Bruni: I can't help that; they are
supposed to read it.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: So, no impression is
made by these words.
Hon. Mr. Bruni: Any words that tend to
make him comply more completely with the
oath should be left in the act.
Hon. Mr. Wall: May I say, you can judge
facts-perhaps that is not the legal termand you can test whether a person has adequate knowledge of the responsibilities or
privileges of a Canadian citizen, but how are
you going to test me or anybody else as to
whether I intend to comply with the oath of
allegiance, to which I have very solemnly
subscribed on the Bible?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Non-intention to comply would constitute fraud under section 19.
Hon. John J. Connolly (Ottawa West):
Honourable senators, may I say a word or two
on this point raised by the junior senator
from Winnipeg (Hon. Mr. Wall)?
I have
before me section 10 of the Canadian Citizenship Act, as it appears in the Revised Statutes of Canada. That section, which deals
with the granting of a certificate of citizenship, says the minister may in his discretion
grant a certificate under certain conditions.
They are as follows: first, he must have filed
a declaration in the office of the clerk;
secondly, he must be lawfully admitted to
Canada; thirdly, he must have resided continuously in Canada for the prescribed time.
All of that can be proved by ordinary
evidence.
The
requirements
continue:
fourthly, that he is of good character; fifthly,
that he has adequate knowledge of either
English or French; sixthly, that he has an

adequate knowledge of the responsibilities
and privileges of a Canadian citizen-that
is the clause to be amended-and seventhly,
that he intends to reside in Canada.
I think there may be a good deal in what
the honourable junior senator from Winnipeg has said, in view of the fact that section
12 of the act prescribes that a certificate of
citizenship granted to any person under this
part, other than a minor under the age of
14 years, shall not take effect until the applicant has taken the oath of allegiance set
forth in the second schedule, and thereupon
the person shall become a Canadian citizen.
The oath of allegiance reads:
I, A.B., swear that I will be faithful and bear
true allegiance to Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth
the Second, her heirs and successors, according to
the law, and that I will faithfully observe the
laws of Canada and fulfil my duties as a Canadian
citizen. So help me God.

When a person bas taken that oath I suppose he can be cross-examined on whether
he understands it. But an oath is an oath;
and the citizen who takes the oath swears
before God to do whatever is required before
the law, as a citizen of this country.
Now, how are you going to find out that
he intends to comply with the oath? I would
think the only way in which that could be
donc would be by further examining the apphicant under oath and saying to him: "This
is the oath you are going to take. Are you
going to observe it?" Suppose he answers
"Yes". Do you get more from that answer
than you get from the oath? The oath of
allegiance in itself is sufficient for the laying
of a charge against him if he has not been
faithful and borne allegiance.
Honourable senators, I do not think there
is very much help for anybody in the words

added to paragraph (f). I do not think they
wil add anything to what is in the oath of
allegiance now, with respect to the responsibility that devolves upon the man who takes
the oath. Frankly, I do not think the court
before which the oath is taken is going to
get any more information by evidence given
under oath by the applicant than it would
get from hearing the oath of allegiance taken.
Hon. Mr. Bruni: Do you not think it impresses the oath upon him a bit more than
if those words were not there?
Hon. Mr. Connolly: I cannot believe that
it could, for the reason that if there is anything that should be supremely impressive
in a matter of this kind it is the oath of
allegiance itself, and not what the prospective
Canadian citizen might think or say of what
he should do in respect of that oath. I think
when he is given the oath to read and to
swear to, everything that is implied in the
responsibilities of a Canadian citizen should

SENATE
be in that oath, and if the oath is not adequate another form might be devised. Personally, I th'nk it is adequate, and I do not think
the addition of the words is going to add
anything or do any harm. At the moment
I cannot understand why it may be necessary
to add these words.
The other point I would like to draw to the
honourable senator's attention is the use of
the word "and" in line 23 on page 1 of the
bill. I may say that I raised this, not on my
own account but at the suggestion of the
honourable senator from Toronto (Hon. Mr.
Hayden), who could not be here today. He
felt that if a person charged with an offence
were out of the country and refused to return,
it does not add much to the section to say
that in addition it must be established that
he has not appeared at a preliminary inquiry.
I think the honourable senator from Toronto
thought that in any event, a preliminary inquiry could not be effectively held unless the
person charged with the offence were actually
present in court, or had been served. I assume
he was thinking of personal rather than substitutional service. This is a pretty technical
point and may not be as important as the
honourable senator from Toronto thought it
was. But I raise it in case it bas been dealt
with by the department.
Hon. Mr. Bruni: Does this section not provide for service that is not personal? I think
it does. It provides the manner in which he
can be served.
Hon. Mr. Power: Where?
Hon. Mr. Bruni: In the middle of the clause.
Hon. Mr. Power: "His last known address":
is that it?
Hon. Mr. Bruni: Yes.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: No, that subsection
merely provides that the minister may prescribe the time within which the notice must
be served.
Hon. Mr. Gouin: May I ask a question concerning that same section? A man is charged
with treason. A written notice is sent to him
that he should appear in the courts of
Montreal on such a date. But if he does not
turn up, there cannot be, I think, any preliminary inquiry; we have no system for having
a prosecution in absentia. Se I cannot see
how he can possibly be absent from this
preliminary inquiry and also from the trial,
for under those circumstances a trial cannot
take place. I am not concerned as to whether
any prejudice would be suffered; my point
is the technical one that if a man is absent,
if he does not appear at the preliminary inquiry, there cannot be a trial. I can understand that he might appear at the preliminary

inquiry, then jump bail and flee the country,
and not be present at the date flxed for the
trial; but what I cannot understand is that
he would be absent from both the preliminary
inquiry and the trial.
Hon. Mr. Bruni: If the person in question
is outside the country, which is a contingency
referred to in section 19 (1) (a), I do not suppose it will be possible to get him back to
face a charge, but I think the preliminary
inquiry would have to go on in his absence.
The
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West):
question raised by the honourable senator
from De Salaberry (Hon. Mr. Gouin) is, can
that be done?
I have to rely on the
Hon. Mr. Bruni:
draftsman of the bill, that it can.
Hon. Mr. Power: The point made on behalf
of the honourable senator from Toronto (Hon.
Mr. Hayden), and further referred to by the
honourable senator from De Salaberry, relates
to the insertion of the word "and". It states,
"and has not appeared". It is not likely that
he will appear. If absent from Canada he
cannot appear.
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): I do not
say that it is right, but the point has occurred
to a number of people who are lawyers that
you may be defeating the purpose of the first
part of paragraph (a) by having the word
"and" there.
Hon. Mr. Bruni: Is that not related back
to the sending of the notice? First you must
send the notice, and if he does not appearHon. Mr. Power: If he does not appear
at the preliminary inquiryHon. Mr. Bruni: That is right.
Hon. Mr. Power: There can be no preliminary inquiry if he does not appear.
Hon. Mr. Bruni: I think there will have to
be.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Service by notice is
good service. I think that under the provisions of this bill it is good service to address
the notice to the man at his last known
address.
Hon. Mr. Bruni: Substitutional service, so
to speak.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Therefore he has been
served, and if he has been served the preliminary hearing can proceed whether he
appears at it or not.
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): He can
appear personally or he may appear by
counsel.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: He does not have to
appear. Once he does not appear, it is within

SEPTEMBER 6, 1958
the power of the court to proceed with the
hearing on the case. It happens quite often
in our courts in connection with the summons
under the Motor Vehicles Act. Once a man is
served with the summons the case can proceed; he does not have to appear, but he is
bound by the finding of the court.
Hon. Mr. Power: Can you have a murder
trial without the murderer?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Once the man has
been served you can proceed with the preliminary hearing.
Hon. Mr. Gouin: But not the trial. There
may be a bench warrant issued against him
but there cannot be a trial.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: This refers to a preliminary hearing.
Hon. Mr. Gouin: And a trial.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: "Or", not "and".
Hon. Mr. Gouin: After that we have the
word or".
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: One, or both. I would
think that if he does not appear at the preliminary hearing after having been served in
accordance with the provisions of this bill
his citizenship can be revoked; or if he
appears there and does not appear at the
trialHon. Mr. Bruni: It can be revoked.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: He might appear at
one and then not appear at the other: then
it can be revoked.
Hon. Mr. Bruni: Or if he does not appear
at both.
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): It is
always a little difficult to try to decide questions of law during a sitting of the Senate.
We should be in committee.
I think the provision of section 441 of the
Criminal Code might apply. This clause in
part XIV of the Code deals with compelling
the presence of an accused before a justice.
Hon. Mr. Bruni: While he is in Canada, or
without?
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Otiawa West): I am not
prepared to say whether there is any distinction between whether he is in Canada or
not. It is provided by subsection (3) of
section 441 thatA summons shall be served by a peace officer who
shall deliver it personally to the person to whom
it is directed, or, if that person cannot conveniently
be found, shall leave it for him at his last or usual
place of abode with some inmate thereof who
appears to be at least sixteen years of age.

If he is not living in Canada it is going to
be a little difficult to comply with that
requirement. I mention this further fact, that

the procedure on preliminary inquiry which
follows begins at section 449. Without having
looked into the matter carefully it occurs
to me that the honourable gentleman from
De Salaberry (Hon. Mr. Gouin) is right,
that you cannot have a preliminary inquiry
until you have service, and perhaps the
required service would be the one needed to

comply with section 441. But I am afraid
that without a committee it is impossible
to deal with it.
Hon. Mr. Bruni: If I may answer, I do not
know how, without this clause, you could
ever revoke the citizenship of some person
charged with treason who leaves this country
and goes behind the Iron Curtain. I think the
Government should have the right to revoke
citizenship in a case such as this.
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): I am not
disputing that, but by the wording of the
section and the use of the word "and" you
may make it impossible for the Government
to do what it desires to do.
Motion agreed to and bill read second time.
THIRD READING

The Hon. the Acting Speaker: Honourable
senators, when shall this bill be read the
third time?
Hon. Mr. Bruni: I move the third reading
now.
Motion agreed to and bill read third time
and passed.
BUSINESS OF THE SENATE
Hon. W. M. Asehiine: Honourable senators,
I wish to take this opportunity to say how
much I appreciate the co-operation of all
members on both sides of the chamber during this session. I have enjoyed my work
as Leader of the Government and, like all
other honourable members, I am pleased that
the session is about over. I hope honourable
members will have a fine recess, a merry
Christmas and a happy New Year, and that
when they come back in the middle of January or thereabouts they will be full of vim
and vigour and ready to carry on for another
session, which may last until July 1. Again
I thank you all and wish you the best.
Hon. W. Ross Macdonald: Honourable senators, I wish to say that I also appreciate the
support that has been given to me from both
sides of the house on the various problems
which have faced us throughout the session.
I believe we have given careful consideration
to all legislation that has coMe before us. I
feel that we have served a worth-while
purpose during the first session of this Parliament. I am sure that I speak for all

SENATE
honourable senators when I say how delighted we were when the honourable Leader
of the Government (Hon. Mr. Aseltine) was
appointed to his present position. We had
confidence that he would carry out his functions in a manner which would be satisfactory
not only to those who are associated directly
with him, but also to all honourable senators.
He has discharged his duties admirably and
we will look forward to seeing him when
Parliament reassembles, we hope some time
after Christmas.
